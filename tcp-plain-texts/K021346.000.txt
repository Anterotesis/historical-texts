short State of the Facts to which they relate  th October  WHEN Gen Clavering Col Monson and Mr Francis arrived in Bengal they found the Nabob Mahomed Reza Cawn who had for many years filled the first offices of the state in the greatest distress and living in a small miserable house near Calcutta a prisoner at large He had been divested of his employments and brought down a prisoner to Calcutta in a manner the most disgraceful to a person of his high rank soon after Mr Hastings's accession to the Government in May Various charges were then brought against him of embezzlement maladministration c and  particularly of being concerned in monopolies which contributed to the famine On these charges he was publicly tried by the President and Council And notwithstanding the known and avowed disposition of the Court of Directors as constituted at that time to accomplish his ruin and in spite of the influence of the Government in Bengal he was honourably acquitted but not reinstated His accusers and their abettors irritated at their defeat left this great and good man for such he is if ever a native of India deserved that character overwhelmed with debts and ruined by his long attendance in Calcutta to perish in misery and oblivion that is to suffer all the penalties except loss of honour which could have been inflicted upon him if his innocence had not been established as clear as the Sun  In this condition he remained until the Company's orders of the d of March were received by the Governor General and Council In their letter of that date they say  "that they are well pleased in finding him able to exculpate himself from all the charges brought against him to the satisfaction of their servants"  They say they can have no objection to his total enlargement and in the end they direct that  "if he can with propriety accept of the office of Roy Royan he should be forthwith appointed thereto"  On the th of October the Governor General and Council considering the general intent of the preceding orders and observing that the Court of Directors had fallen into a mistake with respect to the office of Roy Royan which could not be held by a Mussulman determined to recommend Mahomed Reza Cawn to that of Naib Subadar on the same principles which the Company themselves had adopted and precisely on the plan which they had positively ordered to be pursued in their letter of the th of August for the adminisstration of the affairs of the country government The resolution of the Board was opposed by Mr Hastings and Mr Barwell but highly approved of by the Court of Directors In their letter of the th of December they say  "That his abilities have been sufficiently manifested that official experience qualifies him for so high a station in a more eminent degree than any other native with whom the Company has been connected That as no proofs of maladministration have been established against him during the strict investigation of his conduct or since his retirement they cannot but approve of the Board's recommendation of him to the Nabob to constitute him his Naib That they are well pleased at his having received that appointment and that they authorize the Board to assure him of their favour"  On the d of February a letter in the name of the young Nabob Mobarick ul Dowla notoriously fabricated at Calcutta was produced at the Board In this letter he is made to assert that he is arrived at years of maturity and to demand possession of all the offices held by Mahomed Reza Cawn The d of March was appointed by agreement for taking it into consideration On that day it was resolved by a majority of the members present that the Nabob's letter should be referred to the Court of Directors for their determination  On the th of March the preceding resolution was reversed by the casting voice of Mr Hastings united with that of Mr Barwell who attended and all the Nabob's requisitions complied with  On the th of May the Nabob wrote to the Governor to inform him that he had appointed Sudder ul Hoc Cawn a poor superannuated dependant of Mr Hastings to be his Naib and Raja Gourdas the son of Nuncomar to the office of the Nizamut He also desired that the salary allotted by the Company to the support of a Minister of the Government and lately enjoyed by Mahomed Reza Cawn might be distributed in the following manner  To his motherinlaw Munny Begum    To his mother Baboo Begum    To Sudder ul Hoc Cawn    To Gourdoss    Sicca Rupees    It is to be observed however that this sum exceeds the amount of Mahomed Reza Cawn's salary by rupees which the Nabob desires may be given by the Board in order that his own revenues may suffer no diminution  On the th of May all these requests were complied with by the majority The Company's orders on the parts of this transaction which had come to their knowledge were received at Calcutta the th of November The following extracts from their letter of the th of February contain an exact copy of them  Extract of Company's General Letter to Bengal dated  the th February  No I  PARAGRAPH  We by no means approve your late proceedings on the application of the Nabob Mobareck ul Dowlah for the removal of the Naib Soubahdah The requisition of Mobareck ul Dowlah was improper and unfriendly because he must have known that the late appointment of Mohamed Reza Kawn to the office of Naib Subahdah Minister had been marked with the Company's special approbation and that the Court of Directors had assured him of their favour so long as a firm attachment to the Company's interest and a proper discharge of the duties of his station would render him worthy of their protection We therefore repeat our declaration that to require the dismission of a prime minister thus circumstanced without producing the smallest proof of his infidelity to the Company or venturing to charge him with one instance of maladministration in the discharge of his public duty was improper and inconsistent with the friendship subsisting between the Nabob of Bengal and the Company  PARAGRAPH  Admitting the Nabob's complaint that Mahomet Reza Kawn is not connected with him by  relative ties to be well founded it by no means follows that he has been deficient in duty or sincere attachment to him or that his power is oppressive and dishonourable to the Nabob and his family nor can assertions of this nature unattended by proof have any weight with us  PARAGRAPH  In regard to the Nabob's claim to take charge of his own affairs merely because he is of age and thinks himself capable of conducting them we find it declared by one of your members and not contradicted that he knew with certainty that the Nabob is in his own person utterly incapable of executing any of those offices which were deemed of essential importance to the welfare of the country and we are sorry to find that neither this declaration nor the Protests of two Members of the Council seem to have been thought worthy of an answer by the majority of the Board  PARAGRAPH  The Nabob hopes from your favour and justice to be delivered from the authority of Mahomet Reza Khan He ventures to declare the Company solely indebted to the warm support of his ancestors for their present greatness and advantages He claims the management and administration of the Soubahdarrie as his right and says it will be highly inequitable in the Company to refuse their approbation to his request  PARAGRAPH  We pass over these extraordinary suggestions of the Nabob without reply only observing that in justice to him and ourselves we must take the best care in our power of the peace and internal good government of the country and we are not disposed to hazard the effects which might be occasioned by committing the entire management thereof to his inexperience without enjoining him to accept such assistance and to employ such ministers about his person as may be deemed necessary on the part of the India Company  PARAGRAPH  The d of February we find the Nabob's letter and a question thereon was circulated to the different members of the Board for their opinions to be taken at the next meeting of Council which meeting happened on the d March but one of the members being indisposed did not attend at that Board  PARAGRAPH  We have carefully noticed your debates upon the subject The resolution of Council of that day that the Nabob's letter should be referred to the Court of Directors for their decision and that no resolution should be taken in Bengal on his requisitions without our special orders and instructions appears to us very proper  we must therefore express our disapprobation on finding the said resolution rescinded on the frivolous pleas urged by the majority of the Board three days afterwards  PARAGRAPH  If the absence of a member of Council were sufficient to preclude the discussion of any subject which might have been referred for consideration by a former Board or to invalidate resolutions taken during such absence it would be in the power of any member effectually to defeat the ends proposed by the institution of a Council and to put a total stop to public business We shall not waste time in refuting claims of privilege advanced on this occasion because they appear to us unworthy of consideration and beneath all argument  PARAGRAPH  The Nabob having intimated that he had repeatedly stated the trouble and uneasiness which he had suffered from the Naibship of the Nizamut being vested in Mahomed Reza Khan we observe one of the members of your Board desired the Nabob's repeated letters on the subject might be read but this reasonable request was overruled on a plea of saving the Board's time which we can by no means admit as a sufficient objection  PARAGRAPH  The Nabob's letters of the th and th of August of the d of September and th of November leave us no doubt of the true design of this extraordinary business being to bring forward the Munny Begum and again to invest her with improper power and influence notwithstanding our former declarations that so great a part of the Nabob's allowance had been embezzled or misapplied under her superintendance  PARAGRAPH  Instead of your declaring that the Nabob's demands were grounded on positive rights which will not admit of discussion that the Nizamut is his inheritance that the dependants of the Nizamut Adawlet and Phousdarry appertain to that inheritance that as he is pleased to demand and assert the positive rights of his office as Nizam of the provinces there is no ground for denying his request and that a reference to the Company would be an evasion unbecoming the honour of government the Nabob might have been reminded that a Naib Subahdar was appointed and the office continued without interruption or objection during the government of his ancestors who must have been supposed more capable of governing the provinces than a youth of twenty years of age  PARAGRAPH  You have requested this unexperienced young man to permit all the present Judges and Officers of the Nizamut and Foujedarry Adawlets or courts of criminal justice and also all the Foujedars or officers appointed to guard the peace of the country to continue in office until he the Nabob shall have formed a plan for a new arrangement of those officers and it is with equal surprize and concern that we observe this request introduced and the Nabob's ostensible rights so solemnly asserted at this period by our Governor General because on a late occasion to serve a very different purpose he has not scrupled to declare it as visible as the light of the sun that the Nabob is a mere pageant and without even the shadow of authority No circumstance has happened since that declaration was made to render the Nabob more independent nor to give him any degree of power or consequence you must therefore have been well apprized that your late concessions to Mobareck ul Dowlah were unnecessary and as such unwarrantable  PARAGRAPH  As we deem it for the welfare of the country that the office of Naib Soubahdar be for the present continued and that this high office be  filled by a person of wisdom experience and of approved fidelity to the Company and as we have no reason to alter the opinion given of Mahomed Reza Khan in our letter of the th December we positively direct that you forthwith signify to the Nabob Mobareck ul Dowlah our pleasure that Mahomed Reza Khan be immediately restored to the office of Naib Soubahdar and we further direct that Mahomed Reza Khan be again assured of the continuance of our favor so long as a firm attachment to the interest of the Company and a proper discharge of the duties of his station shall render him worthy of our protection  London  th of February  Extract from the Proceedings of the Board  Pub Dep Consult  Nov  Sir EYRE COOTE absent  Mr BARWELL retired  Mr Francis  I move that the Company's orders for the immediate reinstatement of Mahomed Reza Cawn in the offices he held in January be carried into execution and that a copy of the last paragraph of the Company's letter of the th of February together with an exact Persian translation thereof be transmitted to the Nabob Mobarruck ul Dowla and to Mahomed Reza Cawn with a requisition on the part of the Governor General and Council to the Nabob to conform to the injunctions of the Court of Directors expressed in that paragraph This motion of course supposes that the Governor General shall be requested to signify the resolution of the Board on this subject in the usual manner by Letter to the Nabob  Mr Wheeler  I agree to the motion  Governor General  I must beg leave to decline an immediate answer to the motion which I will deliver at our next meeting which it has been agreed shall be held tomorrow morning  Mr Francis  I must beg that a formal resosolution on the motion may be taken now It could not be unexpected and the more so as I particularly requested Mr Barwell to stay I cannot therefore be suspected of want of candor in pressing for the resolution now I came determined to propose it  Governor General  Since Mr Francis taking an advantage of the absence of one of the members has insisted on an immediate decision of the question I am compelled to give my affirmative or negative to it I have declared that I am not come prepared to deliver my opinion upon a subject of so much delicacy and involving so many consequences I should have been glad to have been allowed some time to consider the nature and tendency of the order and to have accommodated the execution of it to all the circumstances which ought to be taken into consideration in the determination upon it the time that I have required is but the short interval between this hour of three in the afternoon and the hour of ten tomorrow morning  however as this privilege is now denied me I shall in this place and at this time simply content myself with delivering my negative to the motion in the terms in which it is made  Mr Francis  I could have no idea of availing myself of Mr Barwell's absence Every Gentleman at the Board I believe heard me solicit him to stay much less could I have a view of surprizing the Governor General on a subject on which he might be unprepared The Company's Letter was received on Saturday the th instant though it has happened that I myself did not see it till Friday last  Resolved  in the affirmative  Council  Nov  PRESENT  The GOVERNOR GENERAL  Mr BARWELL  Mr FRANCIS  Mr WHELER  The Governor General  moves That the th th th c to th paragraphs of the separate general letter by the Barker dated the th February with Mr Francis's motion and the resolution of the Board thereon be again readAgreed  The Governor General  moves That the Opinions of the Board be taken whether the above resolution shall be approved  Mr Wheler  I should be glad to ask the Governor General whether he makes this motion upon the principle of confirming the minutes of the former Council or on account of the absence of Mr Barwell at the time when the Question was debated  The Governor General  I have put the question in conformity to the constitution and actual  existing rule of this Government that all acts and orders passed at any meeting of the Board shall be approved in the succeeding Council to give them their sanction and I avail myself of this right on account of the advantage which was yesterday taken on account of Mr Barwell's absence  Mr Wheler  I am very sorry to be under the necessity of observing that although I have had the honour of sitting at this Board hear two years it is to the best of my recollection the very first instance that the order necessary to give a sanction to our proceedings as described by the Governor General has been complied with in the sense I believe it is now meant I see no occasion for the present question and therefore I am against it  The Governor General  It is not necessary that this form should be observed in every instance It is always supposed when the Members of the Board tacitly agree to the omission of it the formular preface of every consultation being sufficient to imply it  Mr Wheler  The minutes of every Board or Public Assembly that I have had the honour to attend are constantly read at a subsequent meeting of such Board or Assembly in order that  every member may be fully satisfied that what he has said or entered upon the records is faithfully represented or transcribed But I know not a single instance when the minutes of any Board or Assembly have been read at a subsequent meeting with a view to overset the resolutions of a former meeting if that was admitted in numerous assemblies no question could ever be finally decided The objection in my opinion if it is so meant holds equally strong and I am convinced will be treated with equal disgust by our superiors as they have already treated an act not very dissimilar to this  Mr Francis  The resolution taken yesterday was legal and compleat it wants no confirmation though it may be reversed The official form observed in the proceedings of a former Government and continued under ours is merely a form and so little is it ever regarded that the orders of one Council are constantly executed if the time permits before the meeting of the next  Mr Wheler has assigned the true and only reason for the observance of such a form whatever use or convenience there may be in continuing to observe it it cannot operate against a positive provision of an act of Parliament made since the form in question was first instituted and  which of course supersedes it if in reality it had ever had the effect and operation which the Governor General now attributes to itThe law says  "That in all cases whatsoever wherein any difference of opinion shall arise upon any question proposed in any consultation the Governor General and Council shall be bound and concluded by the opinion and decision of the major part of those present"  The conclusion by which the Council is bound is instant and absolute there is no reference to the confirmation of a subsequent meeting I am sorry the Governor General should repeat an objection already as I think compleatly answered I am not to blame if Mr Barwell notwithstanding my urgent request to the contrary left the Board yesterday at an early hour I should have been much better pleased if he had staid because I should then have had the labour of one debate only instead of two On this subject I need say nothing more since the Court of Directors themselves have taken it up in a similar instance and given their opinion decidedly upon it in the th paragraph of the letter now before us  Mr Barwell  Had the resolution simply gone to the execution of the Company's orders from the sentiments delivered by the Governor General at the last meeting the present question would not have been agitated His objection  to Mr Francis's motion strikes me as confined to the mode that motion prescribes for carrying those orders into execution Mr Francis's motion in my opinion conveys such sentiments as are not authorized by the Company's letter In the body of the motion I find these words  "with a requisition of the Governor General and Council to the Nabob to conform to the injunctions of the Court of Directors"  I know of no injunctions that the Court have laid on the Nabob and I imagine the use of any offensive terms or improper management on a subject of so delicate a nature would be highly reprehensible I therefore vote for rescinding the resolution of the last Council so far as regards the mode of executing the orders of the Council but no farther I agree to the motion that the order be executed but am for leaving the manner of doing it to the discretion of the Governor General From nothing that the Governor General has urged in the course of the debate of yesterday do I perceive the least disposition in him to decline the instructions which the Court of Directors have been pleased to give relative to a Naib Soubah  Governor General  With all the respect and submission which I owe and feel for the authority of the Court of Directors I must declare that I shall not yield even to that authority in any instance in which it shall require my concession  of the rights which I hold under an act of Parliament Those rights are formal obligations with which I am not permitted to dispense neither can I optionally relinquish my own claim to a practice which was followed by Mr Francis himself when he formed one of the majority of the Council and which receives the approbation of the Court of Directors themselves I acknowledge the obligation I owe to Mr Francis for the trouble he has taken in helping me to one instance in consultations th September in which a resolution passed at the preceding consultations which was contrary to the sense and general tenor of the measures proposed by the ruling members of the Board was rescinded by a following motion formally introduced and made by myself If this mode is illegal or irregular it was equally so as at that time but Mr Francis then made no objection to it but in the opinion delivered upon my motion simply said He thought the order should be repeated I recollect also that in a similar instance motions were made either by Mr Francis or by the other members of the majority in concert with him for reading and confirming the proceedings held by them during the absence of Mr Barwell and myself both in this and in the revenue department I will not take up the time of the Board in looking out for the instances but shall desire the  secretary to annex them to this minute The evident intent of these motions was to authenticate all the acts which were considered by the members of the majority as the legal acts of the Board but were disputed and disavowed by Mr Barwell and myself and by obtaining such a formal approbation of them to remove the objections which had been made or which might lie against their validity Respecting the question now before the Board I disapprove of the Resolution as not being warranted by the Orders of the Court of Directors and I think it would be disingenuous and unjust in this Board to exceed the positive orders of the Company in annulling a concession made by them to the Nabob and acknowledged as his due  Mr Francis  The Governor General has very fully proved a proposition which has never been disputed that a resolution taken at one Board may be reversed at the next I must have lost my memory and my senses if I had denied it I do not make profession of such extraordinary candour as to furnish an opponent with arguments against myself In pointing out to the Governor General the consultation of the th September I meant to give him an instance in point which I thought established a conclusion directly the reverse of that which he has drawn from it The Court of Directors will find in the proceedings of that day that I entered a Dissent and Protest against a Resolution  taken at the preceding Council but that I neither disputed its validity nor proposed to reverse or even to reconsider it The proposition for that purpose came from the Governor General himself and was strictly regular and legal It would have been in point had he proved that in the case in question I insisted that the resolution of the preceding day wanted the confirmation of the next and that on that ground I had proposed to reconsider it With respect to the present question the instance proves nothing In the other examples quoted by the Governor General and which I perfectly remember the fact was this The legality of the separate meetings held by General Clavering Colonel Monson and myself was expressly and formally denied That reason alone I presume induced General Clavering to propose and Colonel Monson and myself to agree that the resolutions taken in such separate meetings should be confirmed at the next full meeting of the Board Whether such confirmation was necessary or not the example does not support the Governor General's argument The question now is Whether acts done at a meeting of the Board confessedly regular and legal require any subsequent confirmation not Whether such meeting was or was not in itself legal But setting aside this sort of argument precedents prove nothing against a positive right especially where that  right itself is not in issue We may go on for any length of time by negligence or agreement in following forms which nobody regards The question is not fairly in issue until they are formally insisted upon and denied and some important use attempted to be made of them If the motion I made yesterday did not correspond with the Governor General's idea of the sense of the Company's orders I should have held myself indebted to him for any amendment he might have thought fit to propose and assuredly I should have given it the most respectful attention The profound silence he observed made it impossible for me to judge whether his objection went to the whole of the motion or to any part of it or merely to the form proposed of carrying the Company's orders into execution  Governor General  Whatever doubts were entertained of the legality of the acts done by a part of the Board after my declaration of the dissolution of the actual meeting these doubts were not entertained by Mr Francis who declared the acts to be legal therefore with respect to him the subsequent motion and order to read and approve their proceedings could not be construed as intended to give them that legality which they wanted though they might be covertly intended so by the application of an ancient constitutional form to that effect But  I will here close my part of the argument since I perceive that we dispute only on words Mr Francis admitting that a resolution taken at one Board may be reversed at the next I offer to his option that motion which I have already made or the motion which I now make That the former resolution be reversed And I hereby declare my opinion for reversing the former resolution Mr Barwell has already done it in terms I confess that in this proposal I am irregular but I had rather incur that imputation than suffer the time of the Board to be any longer wasted by a fruitless and a verbal dispute  In this place I shall beg leave to contrast my own conduct with Mr Francis's that since I have been a member of this or any other government I have never in one single instance if I may trust to my own memory and the fullest conviction of what I assert descended to a practice which I should have held unworthy of my own principles of which I have had too frequent occasion to complain in Mr Francis by taking the advantage of an occasional and accidental majority to carry any measure contrary to the sense of the ruling members Even in the first instance which I have quoted I introduced a question for the sake of giving consistency to the orders of the Board although it was productive and so intended of the repeal  of a resolution of the Board which had received my concurrence at the former meeting of it  Mr Francis  I object to both the motions though for different reasons I object to reversing the resolution of the last Board because I deem it a most unwarrantable exercise of a power the existence of which I am obliged to admit No specific reason is yet assigned for it To the latter part of the Governor General's last minute I shall only say that I hope I shall not always suffer in a comparison between his principles of action and mine If he has had  too frequent  occasion to complain of my taking advantage of accidental majorities the word  frequent  must refer to more instances than two It will rest with him to produce more instances if there are any I myself know of none in which he has lost any question by Mr Barwell's absence but that of the one before us and the former one of the d of March on the same subject The resolution which the Governor General proposed to have reconsidered on the th of Sept interrupted a series of measures formed on a different principle I think he did right in proposing to reconsider it This is a single act which has no connection with any thing else  Resolved  That the resolution of yesterday be reversed  The Governor General  moves  "That the pleasure of the Court of Directors signified in the th Paragraph of the general letter of the th February last and the assurance therein directed to be given to Mahomed Reza Cawn be communicated to the Nabob Mobareck ul Dowlah in the words of the general letter"  Mr Francis  I have no objection to the motion as far as it goes but if the communication of the Company's intentions be not accompanied by a formal requisition from this government it is not impossible that they may be defeated I therefore move the following addition to the motion  "That the Governor General be requested to signify to the Nabob Mobareck ul Dowlah in the usual form the requisition of the Governor General and Council for his immediate compliance with the pleasure of the Court of Directors"  Mr Wheeler  I agree to the motion and likewise to the amendment  Mr Barwell  I agree to the motion I cannot be a judge of the terms that Mr Francis would have used in the letter proposed to be written by the Governor General to the Nabob from the general terms in which his amendment is expressed The Governor General can have  no objection to submit the terms in which he makes the communication of the Company's sentiments to the Nabob and Mahomed Reza Cawn to the Board before the letters shall be sent If those are at all defective such additions may be proposed to them as in the judgment of any of the members may appear necessary I think Mr Francis is premature in following the Governor General's motion with another It seems to speak some preknowledge of the difficulties to which our government is subjected and that no small degree of coercion must necessarily support the recommendations of the Company I give my vote simply for the Governor General's motion reserving my opinion for any amendments that may be offered to the letters proposed to be written when such are offered in precise terms as essential to answer the intentions of the Company and consistent with those intentions  Mr Francis  The motion is confined to a bare communication of the Company's orders how it may operate I do not know but as this government is the medium through which all the Company's orders are carried into execution it seems to me unusual at least to leave them in this single instance to execute themselves As for the rest I have no distrust of the Nabob and hope he will comply with them  Governor General  I agree to the question I object to the amendment My reasons have been assigned in the preceding minutes I will not therefore repeat them  Resolved  In the terms of the Governor General's motion  Copy of a Letter proposed by the Governor General to be written to the Nabob Mobareck ul Dowla  "A Letter having been received from the Honourable Court of Directors by the ship lately arrived from Europe in which they have thought proper to signify their pleasure that Mahomed Reza Khan be immediately restored to the office of Naib Subah and to direct that he be again assured of the continuance of their favor so long as a firm attachment to the interest of the Company and a proper Discharge of the Duties of his station shall render him worthy of their protection"  it becomes my duty therefore in compliance with their orders to communicate the same to your Highness  The same to Mahomed Reza Khan mutatis mutandis  November  Mr Francis  I do not disapprove of the Letter to the Nabob Mobarek ul Dowla as far as it goes except that the whole of the last paragraph of the Company's Letter of the th of February should be recited in it But I think that this recital should be followed by a formal requisition on the part of the Governor General and Council demanding his compliance with the Company's pleasure I have no personal distrust of the Nabob but he is too young and inexperienced to judge for himself nor am I sure that very dangerous advice may not be given him by some persons immediately interested in the arrangement of Mahomed Reza Cawn's offices and salary The communication of the Company's pleasure in its present form appears to me irregular and I believe it to be wholly unprecedented The authority of the Court of Directors over the government of these provinces which in effect is that of the nation over a dependent dominion does not act directly and immediately on the things or persons subject to it in India but always through the medium of their local representatives The omission of the use of this medium in a single and in so remarkable an instance may possibly suggest to the Nabob or his advisers that there is a reluctance in the Governor General and Council to execute the Company's orders and furnish them  with some formal pretence for not complying with them which otherwise would not be attempted  For these reasons I deem the proposed letter essentially defective and incomplete and am therefore against it  Translation of a Letter from the Nabob Mobareck ul Dowlah inclosed in a Letter from the Resident at the Durbar dated the th and received the th of December  I have been favoured with your friendly letter under date the st of Zecaide  You write  "that a letter has been lately received from the Court of Directors expressing their pleasure that the Nabob Mahomed Reza Khan be restored to the office of Naib Subah"  My Patron When the aforesaid Nabob was first appointed to the Naib Subahship it was entirely on this account that by reason of my tender age I could not transact my own affairs in person but required the assistance of a Naib When I became of age there was no further occasion for a Naib and I accordingly wrote you on the subject and informed you that I would  take on myself the management of my own affairs and had no further use for a Naib and as this was perfectly reasonable you in council gave your sanction thereto and favoured me with a letter authorizing me to take the administration on myself and to dismiss the said Nabob which was accordingly done and from that time to the present the affairs of the Nizamut Foujedaree and Adaulet dependant on the Nizamut have been conducted on that plan by my authority The letter lately received from the Court of Directors signifying their pleasure that the said Nabob be restored to the Naib Subahship fills me with the greatest astonishment nor can I penetrate the motive of it Perhaps the circumstance of my having arrived at years of maturity has not yet reached the ears of the Court of Directors in Europe and notwithstanding the number of children and dependents which I have they still reckon me an infant otherwise would they have determined to place my family under the authority of another and written you for that purpose In a word it was necessary that I should inform you of my situation which I formerly did and it depended on you to transmit such information to the Court of Directors  It is notorious that the meanest of the people will not admit of the authority of a stranger in their families how can it then be expected of  me In a word I administer the affairs of the Nizamut which are in fact the affairs of my own family by my own authority and shall do so and I can never on any account agree to the appointment of the said Nabob to the Naib Subahship which would bring the greatest dishonour disgrace and contempt on me I will never of my own consent admit the said Nabob to any authority in the affairs of the Nizamut Foujedaree and Adawlet dependant on the Nizamut and from motives of justice I expect that regarding the rights which my late father is allowed to have had on the Company you will never consent that any compulsion be put in practice against me on account of this business and that you will use every means for the preservation of my credit honour and dignity  Council  th December  Read the letters from Mobareck ul Dowlah and Mahomed Reza Khan  Mr Francis  I must request the attention of the Board to a short recapitulation of the principal steps taken and declarations made by the Nabob and by this government in relation to the removal of Mahomed Reza Khan and to the succeeding distribution of the several offices held by him  In a letter received from the Nabob on the th of November he desires  "That Munny Begum may be allowed to take on herself the administration of the affairs of the Nizamut without the interference of any other person whatever"  and adds that  "by this the Governor will give him compleat satiffaction"  In his next letter he desires  "that Mahomed Reza Khan may be removed"  and expresses his hopes that  "as he himself is now come to years of maturity and by the blessing of God is not so devoid of understanding as to be incapable of conducting his own affairs the Governor will give him the management of the affairs of the Nizamut and of his own household together with the administration of the Adawlet and Phouzdarry"  As the Court of Directors themselves have fully discussed the claims and pretensions stated in this letter I shall not attempt to add any thing to their observations thereupon  On the th of March a letter from the Governor informs the Nabob that  "it had been agreed that his Excellency being now arrived at years of maturity the control of his own household and of the Courts dependent on the Nizamut and Phouzdarry should be placed in his hands and Mahomed Reza Khan was directed at the same time to resign his authority to the Nabob"  In a letter received from the Nabob on the th of May he says  "he has made choice of Sudder ul Hoc Khan to fill the station of Naib of his Adawlet and Phouzdarry and of Raja Gourdoss for the office of the Nizamut and desires that Mahomed Reza Khan's salary may be divided between those two persons and the two Begums"  On the requests contained in the letter and immediately complied with I have nothing to add to the remarks stated in my minutes of the th of May except that there could not be a grosser contradiction than first to remove Mahomed Reza Khan on pretence of the Nabob's executing the several offices himself and immediately afterwards to appoint other persons to execute those offices and at the same time to give a considerable portion of the salary annexed to them to the two Begums  Sudder ul Hoc Khan in a letter received st September says  "His Highness himself is not deficient in regard for me but certain bad men have gained an ascendancy over his temper by whose instigation he acts"  After complaining of the slights he receives from the Nabob he adds  "Thus they cause the Nabob to treat me sometimes with indignity at other times with kindness just as they think proper to advise him their view is that by compelling me to displeasure at such unworthy treatment they may force me either to relinquish my  station or to join with them and act by their advice and appoint creatures of their recommendation to the different offices from which they might draw profit to themselves"  In a subsequent letter to the Governor Sudder ul Hoc Khan says  "The Begum's ministers before my arrival with the advice of their counsellors caused the Nabob to sign a receipt in consequence of which they received at two different times near rupees in the name of the officers of the Adawlet Phouzdarry c from the Company's Sircar and having drawn up an account current in the manner they wished they got the Nabob to sign it and then sent it to me"  In the same letter he asserts that these people have the Nabob intirely in their power  On the st of September the Governor informs the Nabob that it is highly expedient that Sudder ul Hoc Khan should have full control in all matters relative to his office and the sole appointment and dismission of the Sudder and Mofussil officers and that his seal and signature should be authentic to all papers having relation to the business entrusted to him I therefore intimate to you that he should appoint and dismiss all the officers under him and that your Excellency should not interfere in any one  The Nabob in a letter to the Governor received d September says  "Agreeably  to your pleasure I have relinquished all concern with the affairs of the Phouzdarry and Adawlet leaving the intire management of them in Sudder ul Hoc Khan's hands"  Sudder ul Hoc Khan in a letter received th September says  "Yatibar Ally Cawn Munny Begum's chief Eunuch from the amount of the salaries of the officers of the Adawlet and Phouzdarry which before my arrival he had received for two months from the Sircar made disbursements according to his own pleasure He had before caused the sum of rupees on account of the price of mine and my Paishere's Kellaats to be carried to account and now continually sends a man to demand from me four thousand three hundred and odd rupees as the balance of the price of Kellaats and constantly presses me to take it from the amount of the salaries of the officers of the Adawlet and Phouzdarry and send it to him and I shall be under the necessity of complying I mention this for your information"  The Governor General's letter to the Nabob dated the th of October contains a representation so pointed and so very just of the fatal effects which had attended the Nabob's interfering in the administration of justice that I shall insert it intire but without any comment in fact it speaks too plainly to require one  "At your Excellency's request I sent Sudder ul Hoc Khan to take on him the administration of the affairs of the Adawlet and Phouzdarry and hoped by that means not only to have given satisfaction to your Excellency but that through his abilities and experience these affairs would have been conducted in such a manner as to have secured the peace of the country and the happiness of the people and it is with the greatest concern I learn that this measure is so far from being attended with the expected advantages that the affairs both of the Phouzdarry and Adawlet are in the greatest confusion imaginable and daily robberies and murders are perpetrated throughout the country  This is evidently owing to the want of a proper authority in the person appointed to superintend them I therefore addressed your Excellency on the importance and delicacy of the affairs in question and of the necessity of lodging full power in the hands of the person chosen to administer them In reply to which your Excellency expressed sentiments coincident with mine notwithstanding which your dependents and people actuated by selfish and avaritious views have by their interference so impeded the business as to throw the whole country into a state of confusion from which nothing can retrieve it but an unlimited power lodged in the hands of the superintendant I therefore request  that your Excellency will give the strictest injunctions to all your dependents not to interfere in any manner with any matter relative to the affairs of the Adawlet and Phouzdarry and that you will yourself relinquish all interference therein and leave them intirely to the management of Sudder ul Hoc Khan This is absolutely necessary to restore the country to a state of tranquillity and if your Excellency has any plan to propose for the management of the affairs in future be pleased to communicate it to me and every attention shall be paid to give your Excellency satisfaction In the mean time I have given directions to Sudder ul Hoc Khan to take the sole management of them into his own hands and to apply assiduously to the restoration of tranquillity and good order in the country and I must request that your Excellency will confirm them by similar orders to him otherwise a measure which I adopted at your Excellency's request and with a view to your satisfaction and the benefit of the country will be attended with quite contrary effects and bring discredit on me"  From the preceding correspondence I think it appears beyond dispute that the Nabob himself has hitherto been a mere cypher through the whole transaction or rather an instrument in the hands of Munny Begum and others employed by them and for their purposes only  to accomplish the removal of Mahomed Reza Khan That these people have made a most dangerous and iniquitous use of the Nabob's name and authority while they had both at their disposal And that the Governor General himself was convinced that the interference of the Nabob or of those who acted for him in the affairs of the Nizamut had been attended with the most ruinous consequences which he accordingly endeavoured to obviate by directing him not to concern himself in any shape in the conduct of the business intrusted to the Naib Subadar  With respect to the Nabob I shall only observe that his letters involve him in a very disgraceful dilemma If I could believe it possible that freely and of his own mere motion he could recommend  "  That Munny Begum should take on herself the management of the affairs of the Nizamut without the interference of any other person  that he should in one letter desire to conduct the affairs of the Nizamut himself and in the next that a Naib should be appointed to conduct them for him I should give little credit to the assertion with which these requests are accompanied viz  "  that he is not devoid of understanding  "  He may arrive at years of maturity but if at the age of twentyone he does not perceive the folly and absurdity of such propositions and such  contradictions I should despair of his ever arriving at years of discretion On the other hand if these letters are written for him which I am thoroughly satisfied is the case if he has no will of his own and if the rights and authorities demanded in his name are in reality to devolve to Munny Begum to her chief eunuch and to the other persons of whose misconduct the late Naib Subadar made so many complaints to the Governor what opinion are we to entertain of his Excellency's understanding and veracity or on what ground can we commit the management of such important affairs to a young man so dependant on Munny Begum and evidently so incapable of judging or acting for himself  I now proceed to the last orders from the Court of Directors they consider the whole subject in the same light that I do they acknowledge no right of inheritance in the Nabob they understand every ostensible accession to his power as a real one to that of Munny Begum they deem it for the welfare of the country that the office of Naib Subadar should be continued and they positively direct us forthwith to signify to the Nabob their pleasure that Mahomed Reza Khan be immediately restored to it  But notwithstanding they had a thorough knowledge of the facts and were perfectly  acquainted with all the characters they certainly were not aware of the possibility of such a case as now exists or they would have provided against it They did not foresee that their positive orders would not be inforced by this government or that such orders would be disobeyed When they read the Nabob's late letters the false and frivolous pretences on which he ventures to counteract and defeat an arrangement which the Company have deemed necessary for the welfare of the country will astonish them no less than our acquiescence in such pretences  First He says  "that he had formerly written to the Governor that he had no farther occasion for a Naib and would himself conduct his own affairs"  And he asserts that since the dismission of Mahomed Reza Khan to the present time the business had been conducted under his own immediate direction Is it possible he should forget that in consequence of Sudder ul Hoc Khan's appointment the Governor had expressly required him not to interfere and that the Nabob had thereupon relinquished all concern with the affairs of the Fouzdarry and Adawlet and left the entire management of them in the hands of the Naib In his next letter he talks of the rights of his deceased father as well as his own as if the office of Nazim were hereditary He talks of his  claims on the Company as if he held by some other title than their friendship and protection or as if either he or his father had any right in the Subadary beyond what they derived from the voluntary acts of the Company or of their representatives He says he never will admit Mahomed Reza Khan to possess any degree of authority in his family and that as Sudder ul Hoc Khan is dead he shall take on himself the management of the business In his last letter he observes that Mahomed Reza Khan was at first appointed on account of his the Nabob's tender age which required the assistance of a Naib forgetting not only that a Naib Subadar was appointed and the office executed without objection during the government of his predecessors but that he himself had submitted about a year ago to the appointment of Sudder ul Hoc Khan and that the latter continued to execute his several offices till his death with powers totally and avowedly independent of the Nabob he forgets or perhaps he does not know that the treaty of March by which alone his rights whatever they may be were created provides for the appointment of a Naib of the provinces to be invested with the management of affairs and that this Naib was appointed at the instance of the Governor and Gentlemen of the Council In the same letter the Nabob declares that he administers the affairs of the Nizamut  by his own authority and  shall do so  and that he never can on any account agree to the appointment of Mahomed Reza Khan to the Naib Soubaship  The Governor General's letter of the th of October will shew the Company not only in what manner this important business is likely to be conducted and what opinion the Governor General himself entertains of the Nabob's capacity but that neither were his supposed rights and the maturity of his age attended to at that time nor his personal inclinations consulted Notwithstanding all his claims to the Phouzdarry and Adawlet the Governor's pleasure divested him of both and left him without an option These however are not the first and immediate objects of consideration A new and unexpected question is now before us The Company's orders are disobeyed on pretended principles which suppose the existence of an authority in these provinces independent of the authority of Great Britain over them That of the Court of Directors is the only medium by which the subjection of Bengal to Great Britain is held and secured In opposition to it the Nabob declares that  he acts by his own authority and shall continue to do so  I do not know what name the law will give to disobedience of the Company's lawful orders by this Board or whether such disobedience directly avowed by ourselves would not be less  criminal and in its consequences less dangerous than under the form which it now assumes but every man must see which way the present example leads and what use may be made of it If some vigorous measure be not immediately taken by the Company to disarm the Nabob of all means of resistance or at least to deter him from attempting it again their dominion over Bengal is not secure I am sorry this inexperienced young man should have been so unhappily advised He does not know on what dangerous ground he treads He forgets himself too grossly when he disobeys the Company's positive orders and in the same breath tells the Governor General  "You are the master and my patron and I can take no measure without first communicating it to you"  The Company will consider whether this avowed distinction between them and their local representative be not something more than disrespectful or whether their injunctions would have been slighted if they had been accompanied by the usual and proper requisition on the part of the Governor General and Council which I repeatedly recommended without success Other and more alarming reflections will naturally succeed The ostensible shadow of the Nabob's authority may in time find a substance to support it If the spirit of party and faction which prevails through every department  of government and through every other rank of life should reach to the Seapoys it would be a painful but not a difficult task to count the few remaining steps which lead inevitably from that state of things to final dissolution At whatever distance that danger may appear to be yet if the course we are in points directly to it I trust that the wisdom of the Company will not deem it unworthy of their instant consideration The same measures by which a great and imminent mischief might have been prevented will not be sufficient to correct or retrieve it  I now move that it may be resolved That the preceding letter from the Nabob is highly dissatisfactory to the Board and that the Governor General be requested to signify the same to him and to demand in our name his immediate compliance with the orders of the Company  Mr Wheler  I agree to the motion  Mr Barwell  If any advantage was stated to derive to the Company by controuling the will of the Nabob it might be a question with me how far the occasion would vindicate the compulsion proposed but when no national benefit can accrue nor is stated I cannot give my assent to a very exceptionable measure  Governor General  I shall take another occasion to declare my sentiments at large on the subject  of this motion For the present I shall content myself with declaring that I have gone to the utmost lengths prescribed to me by the Company's orders and by my sense of my duty and that I will not go beyond them  The motion resolved in the negative  Mr Francis  Since it is resolved that the Board will not insist on the Nabob's compliance with the Company's orders nothing is left for me but to move as I now do that the salary allotted by the Company out of their revenue for the support of the office of Naib Souba amounting to three lack of sicca rupees per annum or so much of it as was divided between Munny Begum Baboo Begum Raja Gourdass and Sudder ul Hoc Cawn may cease and be made a saving in the Company's treasury from the day when Sudder ul Hoc Khan died  It is the Company's property and if it be not employed in the manner they direct it should not at least be applied to any other purpose  Mr Wheler  I agree to the motion  Mr Barwell  I must desire that the fund from which this payment is made to the ministers of the Nabob be stated by the Accomptant General before I give my opinion on the motion  Governor General  I object to the question in the terms of it but consent to wait for the information required by Mr Barwell  Minute of Council  the th December  Considered the motion made by Mr Francis at the last consultation viz  "That the salary allotted by the Company out of their revenues for the support of the office of Naib Soubah amounting to three lacks of sicca rupees per annum or so much of it as was divided between Munny Begum Baboo Begum Raja Gourdass and Sudder ul Hoc Khan may cease and be made a saving in the Company's treasury from the day when Sudder ul Hoc Khan died"  Mr Barwell  By the letter received by Mr Croftes the charge of the Nizamut allowances appears to be defrayed by the Company There was I find a certain fund under the name of the Sinking Fund established upon the orders of the Company limiting the personal charges of the Nabob to the sum of sixteen lacks and reserving sicca rupees per annum and to this fund was charged certain demands against the Mogul government which have since been totally liquidated as will appear more particularly by a state of the fund which I have just now received from Mr Croftes If it was incumbent on the Nabob to discharge out of the allowances made to him by our government the different claims which appear to be stated in this account I do not see any reason why the  Company should continue burthened with certain expences which arise solely on the score of his government while those means which he has of providing for the whole from his established allowances remain unapplied By the present method it appears to me that the savings stated in the Sinking Fund are made totally at the expence of the Company because the charges of the Nizamut or country government dependant on the Soubah instead of being disbursed from the sum allotted for the Soubah's government are disbursed from the Company's means and the claim on the score of the allowances fixed for the charges of the Soubah's government suffered to accumulate to the exorbitant sum of rupees as a debt due from the Company This being the case there appears to me an absolute necessity to correct an error which has led Mr Francis into the idea that the disbursements which are made by the Company are made by them out of their revenues for the support of the office of Naib Soubah amounting to three lacks of rupees per annum While the Company hold this fund of rupees per annum of the sum of which by treaty they expressly stipulate to pay for the support of the Soubah's government it is not just that they should be charged with any expence to be disbursed on that account I therefore MOVE  "That all expences that have been incurred or shall in future be incurred  on account of the Nizamut or country government department or the Soubah be set off against the claims of the Soubah for such part of the stipend or salary allotted for the support of his government as has been retained by government for this and other express purposes directed by the Company"  I understand the motion made by Mr Francis to have for its object the compelling the Nabob to accept of Mahomed Reza Khan for his minister or to reserve the sum which is allotted as the due of Mahomed Reza Khan to be disposed of by the orders of the Company This motion being made on the presumption that the Nizamut officers are the officers of the Company and in the pay of the Company can only be supported upon that principle I am therefore against the motion  Mr Francis's motion carried in the negative  Mr Francis  If I understand the preceding minute the savings from which the Sinking Fund therein mentioned was constituted viz sicca rupees per annum accruing since the time when the pension of the Nabob Mobareck ul Dowlah as settled by a treaty highly disapproved of by the Company was reduced to lacks by their positive orders do not belong to the Company and that something will be gained by charging that fund with the amount of the salary allotted by the Company  out of their own revenues for the support of the Naib Subadar It is indifferent to me and I believe perfectly immaterial to the Company in what way the account is stated The charge if disbursed comes out of the Company's treasury it is immediately paid out of the collections of the division of Moorshedebad as the Company will see by referring to our Letter to Mr Martin of the th of May Am I to understand that Mr Barwell means to make the Company debtor to the Nabob Mobareck ul Dowlah for the amount of the above savings if he does I wish it to be declared so in plain terms they would by this time amount as I believe to lacks of sicca rupees If he does not I cannot possibly discover the meaning or application of his motion As for myself I deny the fact and all consequences pretended to be derived from it On the remainder of Mr Barwell's minute there is but little to be said supposing it true that a  real  effective country government now existed and that the affairs of the Nizamut did of right fall under the immediate administration of Mobareck ul Dowlah all which is so manifestly contrary to the fact that it will not bear an argument still it would not follow that my last motion ought to be rejected The sum which I propose to be reserved is not divided among the officers of the Nizamut Mr Barwell surely did not consider in what manner it is actually distributed neither do I admit that my last motion had for its object  the compelling  the Nabob to accept of Mahomed Reza Khan for his minister  It could not possibly have that effect the point was already decided by a preceding resolution and if as I conclude the sole object of the Nabob be to keep the amount of Mahomed Reza Khan's salary and to distribute it among his family and dependents our taking the money from him will not tend to compel him to reinstate Mahomed Reza Khan by which he would equally lose it If that were the only alternative proposed to him he would certainly prefer the measure which freed him from the check of Mahomed Reza Khan's authority and left every thing in his own hands  I have said the mode of stating the account proposed by Mr Barwell is a matter of indifference in itself but as it implies a conclusion in which I do not concur I am against the motion  FINIS
