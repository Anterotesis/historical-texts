PREACHED AND PUBLISHED AT THEIR REQUEST IS INSCRIBED  BY THEIR MOST FAITHFUL SERVANT THOMAS FRANCKLIN  A SERMON PREACHED BEFORE THE SONS OF THE CLERGY  JEREMIAH xlix  Leave thy fatherless children I will preserve them alive and let thy widows trust in me  THE superintendency of divine providence over all the affairs of mankind is a point so fully proved by experience that it is seldom called in question but by the most thoughtless and abandoned The great disposer of all things hath in various parts of holy writ graciously promised his kind interposition to counteract the designs and oppressions of men in a more especial manner hath he frequently declared to aid and protect those who stand most in need of his assistance to be  the  father of the fatherless  and to  defend the cause of the widow to deliver the poor that cry and him that hath none to help him  On this comfortable assurance we may safely rely under all our plagues sorrows and calamities for  God is not a man that he should lie or the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it hath he spoken and shall he not make it good  Leave thy fatherless children  says he  I will preserve them and let thy widows trust in me  Now though these words were at first addressed to a particular nation the promise contained in them doth most certainly extend to all the sons of men and may I think with the utmost propriety be applied to the occasion of this day's solemnity when we are met to commemorate support and encourage an institution raised up and inspired by the providence of God in favour of his chosen servants and ministers the persecuted disciples and followers of his beloved Son who as I shall endeavour in the following discourse more fully to prove could not possibly have carried on the great task allotted them without the manifest and frequent interposition of divine providence exerted in their favour  THERE is not perhaps upon the face of the earth any order of men much less the teachers and preachers of any religion  so poorly and so contemptuously treated as the regular and established clergy of the church of England provided for in a manner so inadequate to their services so unworthy of their dignity so unsuitable to the use and importance of their profession the little patrimony allotted to them is so unequally divided that whilst a few a very few are adorned rewarded loaded with dignities and preferments all the rest are either confined within the pale of bare competency and subsistance or which is more generally the case languishing in vile obscurity and reduced to the utmost streights of penury and distress obliged at the same time to contribute out of their scanty revenues in as large a proportion to all the exigencies of the state as those whose fortunes are entailed on their posterity  IN a country where christianity in its purest form is universally professed where the obligations which the civil power lyeth under to the influence of religion is every day acknowledged where the  See the very learned and ingenious Dr Warburton now bishop of Gloucester's ALLIANCE BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE one of the most excellent and spirited performances in the English language  church is so serviceable to the state it is astonishing that the state should be so forgetful of the church that it should have made no public parliamentary provision for the widows and orphans of a body of men to whom it is so greatly indebted for its safety and preservation  THE clergy have withal the heavier cause of complaint as they are perhaps almost the only persons whose distresses have not at some time or other engaged the general attention A kind and necessary relief hath we know been provided for the widows of those who hazard their lives in the defence of their country the state no doubt wisely considering that those who generously sacrificed their private happiness and comfort to the good and welfare of the community had an incontestable right to public favour and protection that however warmly attached the gallant officer might be to his king and country the ties of nature might still prevail that deep care and anxiety for the interest and safety of a beloved wife might unnerve the strongest arm and depress the bravest heart that on the other hand the satisfaction of leaving her possessed of a moderate competency might smooth the rugged paths of danger and animate him in the pursuit of glory That assistance therefore which though imperfect the legislature have here afforded is noble and praiseworthy  BUT whilst those who fight the battles of earthly princes and vindicate the cause of men are thus beneficently and piously remembered the soldiers of Christ the champions of the  Lord of Hosts  are neglected and forgotten is there nothing due to those who guard the principles and watch over the morals of a nation nothing to the instructors of our youth and the advocates  of our religion to them who check the progress of incroaching vice and cherish the blossoms of rising virtue In  our  army must the generals alone enjoy all the honour and all the profit in our triumphs over atheism and infidelity and no civic crown be given as of old to the private soldier to him who defends with bravery the cause of his divine Master bears the shield of faith and fights the battles of the Almighty  If the religion of Jesus Christ hath any thing in it sacred or respectable if it has a right to command deference and veneration from those who profess and embrace it surely the preachers and teachers of that religion the ministers and dispensers of God's holy word and sacraments have a title to some regard and esteem amongst men if they perform their duty as worthy and conscientious servants for their master's sake they deserve some degree of respect some regard for their welfare some compassion for their misfortunes some relief of their necessities But it is too truly and universally observed that the clergy have of late years fallen into most undeserved neglect and contempt even the poor tribute of external respect formerly paid to their character and function is withdrawn from them and the sacred order itself treated by too many as an object of ridicule a conduct partly owing to the low and indigent state of many of our unfortunate brethren and partly I believe to the dangerous influence acquired over the minds of the multitude by our new sectaries and enthusiasts  who make it their chief business to inspire their followers with an utter abhorrence and contempt of us  To describe the miseries and distresses that attend the lower part of the clergy would present a picture to your eyes too gloomy and terrible to behold Let us then the better to illustrate and confirm the melancholy truth before asserted select one from the middle rank one of those happy few whom some lucky incident the favour of some powerful friend or the beneficence of some kind relation hath advanced to what is generally termed a good living  More than one half what are called  Livings  are under l a Year and near one fourth part under l See Ecton and other authors on this subject  let us suppose him possessed of a moderate income and blessed in the comforts and conveniences of life even this much envied station which so many look up to with an eye of hopeless desire is by no means so eligible as we may be at first inclined to think it Excluded by the nature of his function by laws and statutes which he is bound to obey from all farther views of interest or advantage in any other profession shut out from every other avenue to riches and independency and confined to the narrow path which he is obliged to tread in defrauded perhaps of half his scanty pittance by perverse and litigious men and compelled either to sacrifice a part of his legal rights  or the whole of his much dearer peace and tranquillity obliged to act in all things agreeably to his rank and character to maintain in his habit appearance and conversation the decency and dignity of his profession to live with some degree of taste and elegance suitable to his education and connections and to join his richer brethren in all the acts of charity hospitality and beneficence required of him his family and expences increasing his means to support them at best continuing the same perhaps every year diminishing unable to guard against arts which he is incapable of practising or to struggle with difficulties which he has never experienced he sinks by slow and insensible degrees into poverty despondency and despair scoffed at despised and trampled on by every other order of men and which is still more grating it may be treated with contempt insolence and oppression by the superiors of his own  IF to all these bitter and galling calamities he adds also the melancholy reflection that those who are nearest and dearest to him the wife of his bosom and the children of his loins hang but on the slender thread of his life and depend on that alone for their maintainance and support that the moment it shall please the Almighty to take him hence they must change the pleasing scene of domestic happiness and comfort all the conveniencies of moderate competency for a distressful state of penury and dependance  every misfortune heightened by their reflections on lost happiness every sorrow embittered by the cruel remembrance of past felicity Under these gloomy and dreadful apprehensions what shall support him in his labours what shall animate him in the chearful exercise of his function remove his fears and lessen his affliction but the firm confidence in and reliance on his divine master whose eyes are ever watchful to guard and protect his sons and servants who hath promised to be a  father to the fatherless and to defend the cause of his widow  were it not indeed for this comfortable assurance he must inevitably sink beneath the weight of his misfortunes  To mitigate the rigor of these distresses to soften the pressure of these calamities is the business which has this day called us together Thanks be to God the defects of the whole community have been supplied by the generosity of individuals and the evils arising from public parsimony in a great measure removed by private beneficence  AMONGST all the fair daughters of charity that adorn this benevolent nation and shine forth as the  polished corners of the temple  there is not one whose charms are more striking whose beauties are more attractive than the noble and excellent institution which we are this day met to encourage and support A design which in spite of all the attempts that have been made to subvert  and all the arts which have been practiced to undermine and destroy it hath hitherto answered the warmest wishes of its friends and defeated the malice of its enemies like that religion whose cause it espouses and whose ministers it relieves it is  built upon a rock  even  the rock of Christ  and  can never fail  THE excellent charity now under our consideration doth naturally address itself to three orders of men namely the  laity  the  superior  and the  inferior clergy  what claim it may with justice lay to protection and support from each of them will perhaps appear more evident from the following considerations  THERE was a time when the secular interests of the clergy and  laity  of this kingdom were entirely separate and distinct from each other in the days of popery and superstition the clergy received great and manifold advantages from the community and returned nothing to it that celibacy which brought shame and disgrace on themselves was attended also with the most pernicious effects to society  BY the reformation this wall was broken down the holy institution of marriage which had been long withheld and was now restored to the ministers of the gospel opened a social intercourse and free communication between them which was soon productive of the greatest benefits and advantages to the commonweal  The clergy notwithstanding who by their labours and assiduity in the cause of truth had been the chief instruments in perfecting that noble and salutary work were themselves with respect to temporal affairs the least gainers by it they who had freed others continued still in a state of bondage and groaning beneath the yoke of penury and oppression the lands and revenues which had been unjustly wrested from them instead of being restored were lavished away by a licentious and despotic sovereign amongst his greedy courtiers and dependents and the clergy left from that time even unto this day the sad and reproachful monuments of public ingratitude  YOU my brethren of the laity received the benefits of the reformation whilst they and they alone who had best deserved the reward were unjustly and uncharitably deprived of it on you therefore it is in some measure incumbent to repair the injury and as you contributed to our poverty to relieve the inconveniencies and distresses arising from it  TO those amongst the laity who are descended from the clergy I am satisfied it is needless to add any exhortation their noble and liberal contributions their unwearied pains and assiduity their chearful acceptance of that expensive office which they so readily every year take upon them with their constant appearance at this solemnity do most abundantly testify their  goodwill tenderness and affection towards us So far are they from being ashamed of their birth and origin that they openly and zealously proclaim it standing forth with joy and alacrity in the defence and support of their distressed and unfortunate brethren There are indeed amongst them so many of high rank and fortune that a partial observer might be almost tempted to doubt the truth of what hath been before advanced and to imagine that the sons of the clergy far from being the most indigent and oppressed are the richest and happiest of men but this would notwithstanding be a false and illgrounded conclusion as most of those whose  The brave Admiral  Pocock  Jointconqueror of the  Havannah  most generously contributed one hundred guineas towards the support of this charity on the feastday as did also  John Thornton  Esq  one of the stewards for the present year  ample fortunes enable them so generously to contribute to this charity are not indebted to the church for their affluence not to the ecclesiastical preferments of their fathers but either to their family estates and possessions▪ or to their own industry and success in more lucrative professions  THE  superior clergy  of the church of England enjoy many and great temporal advantages some of them bear a part in the legislature of the kingdom others by their rank and dignity their fortunes and preferments are enabled to associate with and consequently in some measure to influence and direct the rich and  great Honour and respect ease and affluence all the good and all the desirable things of this life are in their possession but of all their valuable preeminences doubtless the most to be envied is their extensive power of doing good the power of assisting and relieving their indigent and distressed brethren  A GENEROUS contribution towards the support and encouragement of this peculiar branch of christian charity may be considered in others as an act of kindness humanity and benevolence but with regard to them it is certainly a debt a debt of honour a debt of gratitude a debt of piety which they are bound by the most sacred ties punctually faithfully and religiously to perform  WHEN indeed they consider as no doubt they do and must consider that  the more is given the more will be required  that whilst their fellowservants for fellowservants we all are and fellowlabourers we ought to be are toiling in the vineyard of Christ and bearing the  heat and burthen of the day  their happier lot has exempted them from all the bitter hardships and cruel indignities incident to their profession indignities which few know or attend to but those who feel and experience themthat while their distressed brethren the inferior part of the clergy are lamenting their unfortunate condition and trembling at the melancholy prospect of future miseries they are looking  forward towards the honours and dignities the riches affluence and happiness of their posterity With what grateful hearts should they acknowledge the goodness of that divine Being who hath  cast  their  lot into so fair a ground  and  given them such a goodly heritage  doubtless in proportion to their advantages should be their benevolence in proportion to their abundance should be their generosity  TO the  inferior clergy  I have only to add that the cause which we are here pleading is peculiarly their own and that it would be highly unreasonable in them to expect that others will aid or assist those who will not help themselves If they  cast their bread on  these waters they may  find it  again  after many days  Such indeed is the uncertainty of all human blessings so various are the changes and chances of human life that thousands who are not now in that state or condition which can entitle them to a part or portion of this charity who now give freely without the least distant prospect of receiving may yet one day be indebted to it for the preservation of those who shall hereafter be dear unto them of widows yet unseen and children yet unborn  BUT those to whom I am now addressing myself are too well acquainted with the difficulties and disappointments the sorrows and distresses all the dangers which accompany their  spiritual warfare not to make use of every method in their power to lighten if possible the general burden Those who have smarted beneath the rod of affliction are seldom insensible to the miseries of others they have hearts ever ready to compassionate hands ever open to relieve the distresses of their fellowcreatures  FROM the pious designs and zealous endeavours of these men the charity I am here recommending is indebted for its origin and foundation to this they have always chearfully contributed in proportion to their several abilities these little rivulets have from time to time supplied and replenished that large and copious stream which glideth through our fertile soil blesseth our earth with increase and  watereth the furrows thereof  TO conclude therefore by an earnest exhortation to this whole assembly  AS we have begun let us endeavour to perfect this labour of love let us remember that those whose cause we are now pleading were stewards and dispensers of the mysteries of God and that their names are worthy to be had in remembrance Let us remember that whilst upon earth their prayers were sent up to God for our welfare their faculties dedicated to our service their hours employed in the pious endeavours to promote our true happiness and ensure our everlasting salvation Many  of those whose widows and children now solicit our bounty were themselves kind and constant contributors to this charity in proportion to their abilities they threw in their mite  not grudgingly  or  of necessity but as chearful givers  What they bestowed on others they have doubtless a right when they stand in need of it to demand for themselves  he that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord and look what he layeth out it shall be paid him again  Let us imagine the parents of those orphans the widows of those husbands for whom we are now soliciting still present before us let us imagine them with their last breath bequeathing to us the dear pledges of their love and the objects of their affection imploring us by all the tender ties of humanity and compassion by our enjoyment of present bliss and all our hopes of future happiness to  visit the fatherless and widow in their affliction  to relieve their necessities mitigate their sorrows and alleviate if possible their terrible misfortunes  CONSIDERABLE as the subscriptions have been to this excellent institution they are still found insufficient This noble charity which like an aged and venerable oak spreads its luxuriant branches on every side wide and extensive as it is cannot cover all those who fly to it for shelter  LET us then strive my brethren by every method in our power to render it more useful and more effectual that it may relieve every object worthy of its protection and answer every end designed by its pious and worthy sounders till finished to the highest degree of human perfection it shall imitate the example and adopt the words of the great Creator of all things and say unto the ambassadors of Christ in the words of my text  Leave thy fatherless children I will preserve them alive and let thy widows trust in me  FINIS  ERRATUM  Page Line for  have  read  hath  A  LIST  of the annual Amount of this Charity as compleat as could be procured commencing in the
