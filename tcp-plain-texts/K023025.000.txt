 THE DUNCIAD  P R Arthur  Dennis's Works  Cibber's Plays  DUBLIN Printed LONDON Reprinted  for  A Dodd  THE DUNCIAD AN Heroic Poem  IN THREE BOOKS  DUBLIN Printed LONDON Reprinted for A DODD  THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER  _IT will be found a true observation tho' somewhat surprizing that when any scandal is vented against a man of the highest distinction and character either in the State or in Literature the publick in general afford it a most quiet reception and the larger part accept it as favourably as if it were some kindness done to themselves Whereas if a known scoundrel or blockhead chance to be but touch'd upon a whole legion is up in Arms and it becomes the common Cause of all Scriblers Booksellers and Printers whatsoever  Not to search too deeply into the reason hereof I will only observe as a  Fact  that every week for these two Months past the town has been persecuted  with Pamphlets Advertisements Letters and weekly Essays not only against the Wit and Writings but against the Character and Person of Mr  Pope  And that of all those men who have received pleasure from his Writings which by modest computation may be about a hundred thousand in these Kingdoms of  England  and  Ireland  not to mention  Jerscy    Guernsey  the  Orcades  those in the  New world  and  Foreigners  who have translated him into their languages of all this number not a man hath stood up to say one word in his defence  The only exception is the Author of the following Poem who doubtless had either a better insight into the grounds of this clamour or a better opinion of Mr  Pope  's integrity join'd with a greater personal love for him than any other of his numerous friends and admirers  Further that he was in his peculiar intimacy appears from the knowledge he manifests of the most  private  Authors of all the  anonymous  pieces against him and from his having in this Poem attacked no man living who had not before printed and published against this particular Gentleman  How I became possest of it is of no concern to  the Reader but it would have been a wrong to him had I detain'd this publication since those  Names  which are its chief ornaments die off daily so fast as must render it too soon unintelligible If it provoke the Author to give us a more perfect edition I have my end  Who he is I cannot say and which is great pity there is certainly nothing in his style and manner of writing which can distinguish or discover him For if it bears any resemblance to that of Mr  P  'tis not improbable but it might be done on purpose with a view to have it pass for his But by the frequency of his allusions to  Virgil  and a  labour'd  not to say  affected    shortness  in imitation of him I should think him more an admirer of the  Roman  Poet than of the  Grecian  and in that not of the same taste with his Friend  I have been well inform'd that this work was the labour of full six years of his life and that he retired himself entirely from all the avocations and pleasures of the world to attend diligently to its correction and perfection and six years more he intended to bestow upon it as it should seem by this verse of  Statius  which was cited at the head of his manuscript  Oh mihi bissenos multum vigilata per annos  Duncia  Hence also we learn the true  Title  of the Poem which with the same certainty as we call that of  Homer  the  Iliad  of  Virgil  the  Aeneid  of  Camoens  the  Lusiad  of  Voltaire  the  Henriad  we may pronounce could have been and can be no other than  THE DUNCIAD  It is styled  Heroic  as being  doubly  so not only with respect to its nature which according to the best Rules of the Ancients and strictest ideas of the Moderns is critically such but also with regard to the Heroical disposition and high courage of the Writer who dar'd to stir up such a formidable irritable and implacable race of mortals  The time and date of the Action is evidently in the last reign when the office of City Poet expir'd upon the death of  Elkanah Settle  and he has fix'd it to the Mayoralty of Sir  Geo Tho  ld  But there may arise  some obscurity in Chronology from the  Names  in the Poem by the inevitable removal of some Authors and Insertion of others in their Niches For whoever will consider the unity of the whole design will be sensible that the  Poem was not made for these Authors but these Authors for the Poem  And I should judge they were clapp'd in as they rose fresh and fresh and chang'd from day to day in like manner as when the old boughs wither we thrust new ones into a chimney  I would not have the reader too much troubled or anxious if he cannot decypher them since when he shall have found them out he will probably know no more of the Persons than before  Yet we judg'd it better to preserve them as they are than to change them for fictitious names by which the Satyr would only be multiplied and applied to many instead of one Had the Hero for instance been called  Codrus  how many would have affirm'd him to be Mr  W  Mr  D  Sir  R  B  c but now all that unjust scandal is saved by calling him  Theobald  which by good luck happens to be the name of a real person  I am indeed aware that this name may to some appear too mean for the Hero of an Epic Poem But it is hoped they will alter that opinion when they find that an Author no less eminent than  la Bruyere  has thought him worthy a
