confined you in these Parts the Hurt that you received by the Fall from your Horse I meanCeremony upon these Occasions is nothing more than a civil Excuse for not being rude  Aside  CLARA  Perfectly I thank you Sir Antony insomuch that I think of taking leave of the Farmer this very Day  SIR ANTONY  Marry Heaven forbid it You wou'd not leave us Clara you must notStay stayI have something to say to

Madam shall I entreat your Patience for a few Minutes  OLIVIA  Most readily Child what are your Commands  CLARA  I am an unhappy Woman and as such have a Claim to your Compassion  OLIVIA  I have conceived a very good Opinion of you Clara and am sincerely sorry for any Misfortune that may have happened to you I hope the Hurt that you received by your Fall has had no worse Effects than you at first apprehended  CLARA  Alas Madam my Injuries are of a different Nature The Fall that I feigned to have receiv'd from my Horse as I was travelling homewards was nothing more than a contrived Excuse for concealing myself in these Parts In short Madam I am not what I seem  OLIVIA  That I have long suspected tho' I forbore to be inquisitive  CLARA  You must know then Madam that I am a Woman of good Birth and considerable Fortune my Name Amelia the Daughter of Sir William Hartley Persecuted by my Family who wou'd have driven me into the Arms of a Man who is my mortal Aversion I have taken Refuge here under the Disguise that you now see me wear  OLIVIA  Really Miss Hartley your Distresses affect me and I think you justified in the Step you have taken Give me leave to ask you what Preference directed you to this Neighbourhood  AMELIA  Alas Madam your Question is a natural one but the severest that can be asked me What Preference directed me hither it was a Passion so deeply rooted in my Heart that no Time no Injury can displace it 'Twas LoveHow shall I excuse it to youUnhappy disappointed LoveO Frederick Frederick dear false forgetful Youth  AIR IV  Russell  While on Earth's soft Lap descending  Lightly falls the feather'd Snow  Nature awefully attending  Each rude Wind forbids to blow  White and pure awhile appearing  Earth her Virgin Mantle wears  Soon the fickle Season veering  Her deluded Bosom bares  Thus my foolish Heart believing  Listen'd to his artful Tongue  All his Vows of Love receiving  On each flattering Accent hung  Fondly for a Time mistaken  Love and Joy conceal'd my Fate  Now alas at length forsaken  Sad Experience comes too late  OLIVIA  What do I hear Was Frederick was young Withers thus ingrateful thus insensible Let me hope Amelia there is some Misapprehension in this Matter I know his Intimacy with your Brother and that he made him a Visit this Summer of some Continuance  AMELIA  It was then Madam that my poor Bosom lost that peaceful Indifference it had ever before enjoyed My Family were then in Treaty with the Person I mentioned to you before intoxicated with his extravagant Offers they omitted no Measures to engage me to accept his Addresses nay they were desperate enough to employ Frederick to solicit me but alas their Advocate ruined their Cause my Heart first con+ceived a Distaste to Lord Wealthy and the Interposition of young Withers confirm'd me in my Aversion  OLIVIA  But did Frederick betray his Commission by turning it to his own Advantage  AMELIA  I cannot charge him with that Dishonour therein I must condemn myself it was my own fond unguarded  Heart that told him too plainly what it felt till one fatal Moment my Father surpriz'd him kneeling at my Feet and the next transported him from my Sight for ever  OLIVIA  Your Relation my dear Amelia is truly pitiable but as you know not what Motives Frederick had for so abruptly leaving you so I think you cannot positively charge him with Infidelity  AMELIA  Dear Madam how kindly you console me I own to you I have some Hopes that Frederick still remembers me and still loves me those Hopes conducted me hither I find he is this Day expected home this Event and Sir Antony's ridiculous Assiduities make it no longer possible for me to conceal myself at his Tenant's I must therefore retire till by some means I can discover the real State of Frederick's Heart What I have to entreat of you Madam is for a short Time to afford me the Protection of your House  OLIVIA  Most gladly my dear let us betake ourselves thither this Instant before he comes and surprizes you Come my Chariot is now at the Door  AMELIA  Permit me Madam to step as far as the Garden Gate and excuse myself to the young Farmer who is waiting for me there with my Cloak I'll make haste and attend you  OLIVIA  At your own Time  Exeunt  SCENE IV  The Outside of Sir ANTONY'S Garden HENRY is discover'd sitting and composing a Garland of Flowers he rises  I have made free with some of his Worship's Flowers there is no Robbery in that I trust She stays a long while methinks sure no Accident has betided her I am fit to think his old Honour does not bear an honest Mind towards her he is always hankering about our House and I am sure before Mrs Clara was with us he never us'd to come to Father's except upon Rentday I don't know what ails me I am not half the Lad I was awhile ago I neither eat nor sleep nor work as I us'd to do and as for Wakes and Pastimes and such like lackaday I have no longer any Heart for them or any thing else  AIR V  Lampe  Why heaves my Breast with frequent Sighs  Whence rises this soft Perturbation  In vain my Heart each Effort tries  To combat its fond Inclination  How helpless am I  Where shall I fly  Where shall poor  Henry  for Succour apply  So fixt is the Dart  Too feeble my Art  To assuage the unspeakable Smart  AMELIA enters  HENRY  Oh ifackins I am glad you are come Mrs Clara Look here I have been plaiting a Garland for you to wear at the HarvestHome tonight if you are so minded to accept it  AMELIA  Thank thee Henry I'll wear it for thy sake  HENRY  That's kind nowBut come will you be walking homewards Father and Mother

Well Henry give me my ThingsCommend me kindly to the good Folks tell them I'll call in the Evening and settle Matters with them to their Satisfactionas for thee my good Lad I desire you will accept this Purse I hope it will compensate for the Trouble I have given thee and the Illwill thou hast got from thy Landlord on my AccountWhy what dost weep for Henry  HENRY  My Heart's too full to tell you and I want Understanding to express myselfbut tho' I am a poor Lad I scorn to be a mean one and take Money No Mrs Clara I wou'd not touch your Purse if it was full of DiamondJewels I see you despise me by your Offer  AMELIA  Far from it Henry believe me nor will I press it further upon you as I see it hurts you  HENRY  It does indeedand not that only but your leaving us Mrs Clara I know it won't arguefy what such a simple Clown as I am can say to a Person of your Breedingbut I beseech you to tell me wherein Father or Mother or I have offended you If any thing's amiss that they can remedy they'll be proud to do it I'll vouch for themand as for me If I be in Fault I ask your Pardon heartily on my Knees  AMELIA  Nothing is amiss nothing Kneel not to me young Man your Humility your Tenderness oppresses me Neither thou nor thy Father nor Mother nor any of you have ever offended me on the contrary I owe you all especially thee Henry my Thanks for a thousand Services which are ten times more valuable as I am sure they spring from your Heart  HENRY  'Tis enough I submit May Heaven protect you wherever you go  AIR VI Duetto  Cocchi  Henry  And must we part for ever  Amelia  Yes
