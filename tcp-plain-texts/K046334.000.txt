 THE TIMES A POEM  BY  LONDON PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR And Sold by J COOTE in PaternosterRow J ALMON in Piccadilly W FLEXNEY near Gray'sInn Gate Holborn C HENDERSON at the RoyalExchange J GARDINER in ParliamentStreet Westminster and C MORAN under the Great Piazza CoventGarden MDCCLXIV  THE TIMES  THE Time hath been a Boyish Blushing Time  When Modesty was scarcely held a crime  When the most Wicked had some touch of grace  And trembled to meet Virtue face to face  When Those who in the cause of Sin grown grey  Had serv'd her without grudging day by day  Were yet so weak an awkward shame to feel  And strove that glorious service to conceal  We better bred and than our Sires more wise  Such paultry narrowness of soul despise  To Virtue ev'ry mean pretence disclaim  Lay bare our crimes and glory in our shame  Time was e'er Temperance had fled the realm  E're Luxury sat guttling at the helm  From meal to meal without one moment's space  Reserv'd for business or allow'd for grace  E're Vanity had so far conquer'd Sense  To make us all wild rivals in expence  To make one Fool strive to outvye another  And ev'ry coxcomb dress against his brother  E're banish'd Industry had left our shores  And Labour was by Pride kick'd out of doors  E're Idleness prevail'd sole Queen in Courts  Or only yielded to a rage for sports  E're each weak mind was with externals caught  And Dissipation held the place of Thought  E're gambling Lords in Vice so far were gone  To cog the die and bid the Sun look on  E're a great Nation not less just than free  Was made a beggar by Oeconomy  E're rugged Honesty was out of vogue  E're Fashion stamp'd her sanction on the rogue  Time was that Men had conscience that they made  Scruples to owe what never could be paid  Was One then found however high his name  So far above his fellows damn'd to shame  Who dar'd abuse and falsify his trust  Who being great yet dar'd to be unjust  Shunn'd like a plague or but at distance view'd  He walk'd the crouded streets in Solitude  Nor could his rank and station in the land  Bribe one mean knave to take him by the hand  Such rigid maxims O might such revive  To keep expiring Honesty alive  Made rogues all other hopes of fame denied  Not just thro' principle be just thro' pride  Our Times more polish'd wear a diff'rent face  Debts are an Honour Payment a disgrace  Men of weak minds highplac'd on Folly's list  May gravely tell us Trade cannot subsist  Nor all those Thousands who're in Trade employ'd  If faith 'twixt Man and Man is once destroy'd  Whybe it soWe in that point accord  But what is Trade and Tradesmen to a Lord  FABER from day to day from year to year  Hath had the cries of tradesmen in his ear  Of tradesmen by his Villainy betray'd  And vainly seeking Justice bankrupts made  What is't to FABER Lordly as before  He sits at ease and lives to ruin more  Fix'd at his door as motionless as stone  Begging but only begging for their own  Unheard they stand or only heard by Those  Those slaves in Livery who mock their woes  What is't to FABER he continues great  Lives on in grandeur and runs out in state  The helpless Widow wrung with deep despair  In bitterness of soul pours forth her pray'r  Hugging her starving babes with streaming eyes  And calls down vengeance vengeance from the skies  What is't to FABER he stands safe and clear  Heav'n can commence no legal action here  And on his breast a mighty plate he wears  A plate more firm than triple brass which bears  The name of PRIVILEGE 'gainst vulgar awe  He feels no Conscience and he fears no Law  Nor think acquainted with small knaves alone  Who have not shame outliv'd and grace outgrown  The great World hidden from thy reptile view  That on such Men to whom Contempt is due  Contempt shall fall and their vile Author's name  Recorded stand thro' all the land of shame  Noto his porch like Persians to the Sun  Behold contending crowds of Courtiers run  See to his aid what noble troops advance  All sworn to keep his crimes in Countenance  Nor wonder at itThey partake the charge  As small their Conscience and their debts as large  Propp'd by such Clients and without controul  From all that's honest in the human soul  In Grandeur mean with insolence unjust  Whilst none but knaves can praise and Fools will trust  Caress'd and Courted FABER seems to stand  A mighty Pillar in a guilty land  And a sad truth to which succeeding times  Will scarce give credit when 'tis told in rimes  Did not strict Honour with a jealous eye  Watch round the Throne did not true Piety  Who link'd with Honour for the noblest ends  Ranks none but honest Men amongst her friends  Forbid us to be crush'd with such a weight  He might in time be Minister of State  But why enlarge I on such petty crimes  They might have shock'd the faith of former times  But now are held as NothingWe begin  Where our Sires ended and improve in Sin  Rack our invention and leave nothing new  In vice and folly for our sons to do  Nor deem this censure hard there's not a place  Most consecrate to purposes of grace  Which Vice hath not polluted none so high  But with bold pinion She hath dar'd to fly  And build there for her pleasure none so low  But She hath crept into it made it know  And feel her pow'r in Courts in Camps She reigns  O'er sober Citizens and simple Swains  E'en in our temples She hath fix'd her throne  And 'bove God's holy altars plac'd her own  More to increase the horrour of our State  To make her Empire lasting as 'tis great  To make us in fullgrown Perfection feel  Curses which neither Art nor Time can heal  All Shame discarded all remains of pride  MEANNESS sits crown'd and triumphs by her side  MEANNESS who gleans out of the human mind  Those few good seeds which Vice had left behind  Those seeds which might in time to Virtue tend  And leaves the Soul without a pow'r to mend  MEANNESS at sight of whom with brave disdain  The breast of Manhood swells but swells in vain  Before whom Honour makes a forc'd retreat  And Freedom is compell'd to quit her seat  MEANNESS which like that mark by bloody CAIN  Borne in his forehead for a brother slain  God in his great and allsubduing rage  Ordains the standing mark of this vile age  The venal Heroe trucks his fame for gold  The Patriot's virtue for a place is sold  The Statesman bargains for his Country's shame  And for preserment Priests their God disclaim  Worn out with lust her day of letch'ry o'er  The Mother trains the daughter which She bore  In her own paths The Father aids the plan  And when the Innocent is ripe for Man  Sells her to some old Letcher for a wife  And makes her an Adulteress for life  Or in the papers bids his name appear  And advertises for a L  Husband and Wife whom Av'rice must applaud  Agree to save the charge of Pimp and Bawd  Those parts they play themselves a frugal pair  And share the infamy the gain to share  Wellpleas'd to find when They the profits tell  That they have play'd the whore and rogue so well  Nor are these things which might imply a spark  Of Shame still left transacted in the dark  Noto the Public they are open laid  And carried on like any other trade  Scorning to mince damnation and too proud  To work the works of darkness in a cloud  In fullest vigour Vice maintains her sway  Free are her Marts and open at noonday  MEANNESS now wed to IMPUDENCE no more  In darkness skulks and trembles as of yore  When the Light breaks upon her coward eye  Boldly She stalks on earth and to the sky  Lists her proud head nor fears least time abate  And turn her Husband's love to canker'd hate  Since Fate to make them more sincerely one  Hath crown'd their loves with MOUNTAGUE their son  A Son so like his Dam so like his Sire  With all the Mother's craft the Father's fire  An Image so express in ev'ry part  So like in all bad qualities of heart  That had They fifty children He alone  Would stand as Heir Apparent to the throne  With our own Island vices not content  We rob our neighbours on the Continent  Dance Europe round and visit ev'ry court  To ape their follies and their crimes import  To diff'rent lands for diff'rent sins we roam  And richly freighted bring our cargoe home  Nobly industrious to make vice appear  In her sull State and perfect only here  To HOLLAND where Politeness ever reigns  Where primitive Sincerity remains  And makes a stand where Freedom in her course  Hath left her name tho' she hath lost her force  In that as other lands where simple Trade  Was never in the garb of Fraud array'd  Where Av'rice never dar'd to shew his head  Where like a smiling Cherub Mercy led  By Reason blesses the sweetblooded race  And Cruelty could never find a place  To HOLLAND for that Charity we roam  Which happily begins and ends at home  FRANCE in return for peace and pow'r restor'd  For all those Countries which the Heroe's sword  Unprofitably purchas'd idly thrown  Into her lap and made once more her own  FRANCE hath afforded large and rich supplies  Of Vanities fulltrimm'd of polish'd lies  Of soothing flatteries which thro' the ears  Steal to and melt the heart of slavish fears  Which break the Spirit and of abject fraud  For which alas we need not send abroad  SPAIN gives us Pridewhich SPAIN to all the earth  May largely give nor fear herself a dearth  Gives us that Jealousy which born of fear  And mean distrust grows not by Nature here  Gives us that Superstition which pretends  By the worst means to serve the best of ends  That Cruelty which stranger to the brave  Dwells only with the Coward and the Slave  That Cruelty which led her Christian bands  With more than savage rage o'er savage lands  Bade her without remorse whole countries thin  And hold of nought but Mercy as a sin  ITALIA nurse of ev'ry softer art  Who feigning to refine unmans the heart  Who lays the realms of Sense and Virtue waste  Who marrs whilst She pretends to mend our taste  ITALIA to compleat and crown our shame  Sends us a Fiend and LEGION is his name  The Farce of greatness without being great  Pride without Pow'r Titles without Estate  Souls without vigour Bodies without force  Hate without cause Revenge without Remorse  Dark mean Revenge Murder without defence  Jealousy without Love Sound without Sense  Mirth without Humour without Wit Grimace  Faith without Reason Gospel without Grace  Zeal without Knowledge without Nature Art  Men without Manhood Women without Heart  HalfMen  who dry and pithless are debarr'd  From Man's best joysno sooner made than marr'd  HalfMen  whom many a rich and  noble  Dame  To serve her lust and yet secure her fame  Keeps on high diet as We Capons feed  To glut our appetites at last decreed  Women  who dance in postures so obscene  They might awaken shame in ARETINE  Who when retir'd from the day's piercing light  They celebrate the mysteries of night  Might make the Muses in a corner plac'd  To view their monstrous lusts deem SAPPHO chaste  These and a thousand follies rank as these  A thousand faults ten thousand Fools who please  Our pall'd and sickly taste ten thousand knaves  Who serve our foes as spies and us as slaves  Who by degrees and unperceiv'd prepare  Our necks for chains which they already wear  Madly we entertain at the expence  Of Fame of Virtue Taste and CommonSense  Nor stop we herethe soft luxurious EAST  Where Man his soul degraded from the Beast  In nothing diff'rent but in shape we view  They walk on four legs and he walks on two  Attracts our eye and flowing from that source  Sins of the blackest character Sins worse  Than all her plagues which truly to unfold  Would make the best blood in my veins run cold  And strike all Manhood dead which but to name  Would call up in my cheeks the marks of shame  Sins if such Sins can be which shut out grace  Which for the guilty leave no hope no place  E'en in God's mercy Sins 'gainst Nature's plan  Possess the land at large and Man for Man  Burns in those fires which Hell alone could raise  To make him more than damn'd which in the days  Of punishment when guilt becomes her prey  With all her tortures She can scarce repay  Be Grace shut out be Mercy deaf let God  With tenfold terrours arm that dreadful nod  Which speaks them lost and sentenc'd to despair  Distending wide her jaws let Hell prepare  For Those who thus offend amongst Mankind  A fire more fierce and tortures more refin'd  On Earth which groans beneath their monstrous weight  On Earth alas They meet a diff  rent fate  And whilst the Laws false grace false mercy shewn  Are taught to wear a softness not their own  Men whom the Beasts would spurn should they appear  Amongst the honest herd find refuge here  No longer by vain fear or shame controul'd  From long too long Security grown bold  Mocking rebuke they brave it in our streets  And LUMLEY e'en at noon his mistress meets  So public in their crimes so daring grown  They almost take a pride to have them known  And each unnat'ral Villain scarce endures  To make a secret of his vile amours  Go where We will at ev'ry time and place  S  DOM confronts and stares us in the face  They ply in public at our very doors  And take the bread from much more honest Whores  Th  se who are mean high Paramours secure  And the rich gailty screen the guilty poor  The Sin too proud to feel from Reason awe  And Those who practise it too great for Law  Woman  the pride and happiness of Man  Without whose soft endearments Nature's plan  Had been a blank and Life not worth a thought  Woman  by all the Loves and Graces taught  With softest arts and sure tho' hidden skill  To humanize and mould us to her will  Woman  with more than common grace form'd  here  With the persuasive language of a tear  To melt the rugged temper of our Isle  Or win us to her purpose with a smile  Woman  by fate the quickest spur decreed  The fairest best reward of ev'ry deed  Which bears the stamp of honour at whose name  Our antient Heroes caught a quicker flame  And dar'd beyond belief whilst o'er the plain  Spurning the carcases of Princes slain  Confusion proudly strode whilst Horrour blew  The fatal trump and Death stalk'd full in view  Woman  is out of date a thing thrown by  As having lost its use No more the Eye  With  female  beauty caught in wild amaze  Gazes entranc'd and could for ever gaze  No more the Heart that seat where Love resides  Each Breath drawn quick and short in fuller tides  Life posting thro' the veins each pulse on fire  And the whole body tingling with desire  Pants for those charms which Virtue might engage  To break his vow and thaw the frost of age  Bidding each trembling nerve each muscle strain  And giving pleasure which is almost pain  Women are kept for nothing but the breed  For pleasure we must have a GANYMEDE  A fine fresh HYLAS a delicious boy  To serve our purposes of beastly joy  Fairest of Nymphs where ev'ry Nymph is fair  Whom Nature form'd with more than common care  With more than common care whom Art improv'd  And Both declar'd most worthy to be lov'd  neglected wanders whilst a croud  Pursue and consecrate the steps  She hapless maid born in a wretched hour  Wastes life's gay prime in vain like some fair flow'r  Sweet in its scent and lively in its hue  Which withers on the stalk from whence it grew  And dies uncropp'd whilst He admir'd carest  Belov'd and ev'ry where a welcome guest  With Brutes of rank and fortune plays the Whore  For their unnat'ral lust a Common Sew'r  Dine with APICIUSat his sumptuous board  Find all the world of dainties can afford  And yet so much distemper'd Spirits pall  The sickly appetite amidst them all  APICIUS finds no joy but whilst he carves  For ev'ry guest the Landlord sits and starves  The forest Haunch fine fat in flavour high  Kept to a moment smokes before his eye  But smokes in vain his heedless eye runs o'er  And loathes what He had deified before  The Turtle of a great and glorious size  Worth its own weight in gold a mighty prize  For which a Man of Taste all risques would run  Itself a feast and ev'ry dish in one  The Turtle in luxurious pomp comes in  Kept kill'd cut up prepar'd and drest by QUIN  In vain it comes in vain lies full in view  As QUIN hath drest it he may eat it too  APICIUS cannotWhen the glass goes round  Quickcircling and the roofs with mirth resound  Sober he sits and silentall alone  Tho' in a croud and to himself scarce known  On grief he feeds nor friends can cure nor wine  Suspend his cares and make him cease to pine  Why mourns APICIUS thus why runs his eye  Heedless o'er delicates which from the sky  Might call down Jove Where now his gen'rous wish  That to invent a new and better dish  The World might burn and all mankind expire  So he might roast a Phoenix at the fire  Why swims that eye in tears which thro' a race  Of sixty years ne'er shew'd one sign of grace  Why feels that heart which never felt before  Why doth that pamper'd glutton eat no more  Who only liv'd to eat his Stomach pall'd  And drown'd in floods of sorrow hath Fate call'd  His Father from the grave to second life  Hath CLODIUS on his hands return'd his Wife  Or hath the Law by strictest justice taught  Compell'd him to restore the dow'r She brought  Hath some bold Creditor against his will  Brought in and forc'd him to discharge a bill  Where Eating had no share Hath some vain Wench  Run out his wealth and forc'd him to retrench  Hath any rival Glutton got the start  And beat him in his own luxurious art  Bought cates for which APICIUS could not pay  Or drest old dainties in a newer way  Hath his Cook worthy to be slain with rods  Spoil'd a dish fit to entertain the Gods  Or hath some Varlet cross'd by cruel fate  Thrown down the price of Empires in a plate  None none of thesehis Servants all are try'd  So sure they walk on ice and never slide  His Cook an acquisition made in France  Might put a CLOE out of countenance  Nor tho' old HOLLES still maintains his stand  Hath He one rival glutton in the land  Women are all the objects of his hate  His debts are all unpaid and yet his state  In full security and triumph held  Unless for once a Knave should be expell'd  His Wife is still a Whore and in his pow'r  The Woman gone he still retains the dow'r  Sound in the grave thanks to his filial care  Which mix'd the draught and kindly sent him there  His Father sleeps and till the last trump shake  The corners of the earth shall not awake  Whence flows this Sorrow then behind his chair  Did'st Thou not see deck'd with a Solitaire  Which on his bare breast glitt'ring play'd and grac'd  With nicest ornaments a Stripling plac'd  A Smooth Smug Stripling in life's fairest prime  Did'st Thou not mind too how from time to time  The monstrous Letcher tempted to despise  All other dainties thither turn'd his eyes  How He seem'd inly to reproach us all  Who strove his fix'd attention to recall  And how He wish'd e'en at the Time of grace  Like Janus to have had a double face  His cause of grief behold in that fair Boy  APICIUS dotes and CORYDON is coy  Vain and unthinking Stripling When the glass  Meets thy too curious eye and as You pass  Flatt'ring presents in smiles thy image there  Why dost Thou bless the Gods who made Thee fair  Blame their large bounties and with reason blame  Curse curse thy beauty for It leads to shame  When thy hot Lord to work Thee to his end  Bids show'rs of gold into thy breast descend  Suspect his gifts nor the vile giver trust  They're baits for Virtue and smell strong of lust  On those gay gaudy trappings which adorn  The temple of thy body look with scorn  View them with horrour they pollution mean  And deepest ruin Thou hast often seen  From 'mongst the herd the fairest and the best  Carefully singled out and richly drest  With grandeur mock'd for sacrifice decreed  Only in greater pomp at last to bleed  Be warn'd in time the threat'ned danger shun  To stay a moment is to be undone  What tho' temptation proof thy Virtue shine  Nor bribes can move nor arts can undermine  All other methods failing one resource  Is still behind and Thou must yield to force  Paint to thyself the horrors of a rape  Most strongly paint and while Thou can'st escape  Mind not his promisesThey're made in sport  Made to be brokeWas He not bred at Court  Trust not his Honour He's a Man of birth  Attend not to his oathsThey're made on earth  Not regist'red in Heav'nHe mocks at grace  And in his Creed God never found a place  Look not for Consciencefor He knows her not  So long a Stranger she is quite forgot  Nor think thyself in Law secure and firm  Thy Master is a Lord and Thou a Worm  A poor mean Reptile never meant to think  Who being well supplied with meat and drink  And suffer'd just to crawl from place to place  Must serve his lusts and think he does Thee grace  Fly then whilst yet 'tis in thy pow'r to fly  But whither can'st Thou go on Whom rely  For wish'd protection Virtue's sure to meet  An armed host of foes in ev'ry street  What boots It of APICIUS fearful grown  Headlong to fly into the arms of STONE  Or why take refuge in the house of pray'r  If sure to meet with an APICIUS there  Trust not Old Age which will thy faith betray  Saint  SOCRATES is still a Goat tho' grey  Trust not green Youth FLORIO will scarce go down  And at eighteen hath surfeited the Town  Trust not to Rakesalas 'tis all pretence  They take up Raking only as a fence  'Gainst Common fameplace H in thy view  He keeps one Whore as BARROWBY kept two  Trust not to Marriage T took a Wife  Who chaste as Dian might have pass'd her life  Had She not far more prudent in her aim  To propagate the honours of his name  And save expiring titles taken care  Without his knowledge to provide an heir  Trust not to Marriage in Mankind unread  S's a married man and S new wed  Would'st Thou be safe Society forswear  Fly to the desart and seek shelter there  Herd with the Brutesthey follow Nature's plan  There's not one Brute so dangerous as Man  In Afric's wilds'mongst them that refuge find  Which Lust denies thee here among Mankind  Renounce thy name thy nature and no more  Pique thy vain pride on Manhood on all four  Walk as You see those honest creatures do  And quite forget that once You walk'd on Two  But if the thoughts of Solitude alarm  And Social life hath one remaining charm  If still Thou art to jeopardy decreed  Amongst the monsters of AUGUSTA'S breed  Lay by thy sex thy safety to procure  Put off the Man from Men to live secure  Go forth a woman to the public view  And with their garb assume their manners too  Had the  lightfooted  GREEK of Chiron's school  Been wise enough to keep this single rule  The Maudlin Heroe like a puling boy  Robb'd of his plaything on the plains of Troy  Had never blubber'd at Patroclus' tomb  And plac'd his Minion in his Mistress' room  Be not in this than Catamites more nice  Do that for Virtue which they do for vice  Thus shalt Thou pass untainted life's gay bloom  Thus stand uncourted in the drawing room  At midnight thus untempted walk the sttreet  And run no danger but of being beat  Where is the Mother whose officious zeal  Discreetly judging what her Daughters feel  By what She felt herself in days of yore  Against that Letcher Man makes fast the door  Who not permits e'en for the sake of pray'r  A Priest uncastrated to enter there  Nor could her wishes and her care prevail  Would suffer in the house a fly that's male  Let Her discharge her cares throw wide her doors  Her daughters cannot if They would be Whores  Nor can a Man be found as Times now go  Who thinks it worth his while to make them so  Tho' They more fresh more lively than the Morn  And brighter than the noonday Sun adorn  The works of Nature tho' the Mother's grace  Revives improv'd in ev'ry daughter's face  Undisciplin'd in dull discretion's rules  Untaught and Undebauch'd by Boarding Schools  Free and unguarded let Them range the Town  Go sorth at random and run pleasure down  Start where She will discard all taint of fear  Nor think of danger when no danger's near  Watch not their stepsThey're safe without thy care  Unless like Jennets they conceive by air  And ev'ry one of them may die a Nun  Unless They breed like Carrion in the Sun  Men dead to pleasure as they're dead to grace  Against the law of Nature set their face  The grand primoeval law and seem combin'd  To stop the propagation of Mankind  Vile Pathicks read the Marriage Act with pride  And fancy that the Law is on their side  Broke down and Strength a stranger to his bed  Old L tho' yet alive is dead  T lives no more or lives not to our Isle  No longer blest with a Cz's smile  T is at P disgrac'd  And M grown grey perforce grows chaste  Nor to the credit of our modest race  Rises one  to supply their place  A Maidenhead which twenty years ago  In mid December the rank Fly would blow  Tho' closely kept  now  when the DogStar's heat  Enflames the marrow in the very street  May lie untouch'd left for the worms by Those  Who daintily pass by and hold their nose  Poor Plain Concupiscence is in disgrace  And Simple Letch'ry dares not shew her face  Least She be sent to Bridewell Bankrupts made  To save their fortunes Bawds leave off that trade  Which first had left off them to  Wellclose Square  Fine fresh young Strumpets for DODD preaches there  Throng for subsistence Pimps no longer thrive  And Pensions only keep L alive  Where is the Mother who thinks all her pain  And all her jeopardy of travail gain  When a Man Child is born thinks ev'ry pray'r  Paid to the sull and answer'd in an heir  Shortsighted Woman Little doth she know  What streams of sorrow from that source may flow  Little suspect whilst She surveys her Boy  Her young NARCISSUS with an eye of joy  Too full for Continence that Fate could give  Her darling as a curse that She may live  E're sixteen Winters their short course have run  In agonies of soul to curse that Son  Pray then for daughters Ye wise Mothers pray  They shall reward your love nor make ye grey  Before your time with sorrow They shall give  Ages of peace and comfort whilst Ye live  Make life most truly worth your care and save  In spite of death your mem'ries from the grave  That Sense with more than manly vigour fraught  That Fortitude of Soul that stretch of Thought  That Genius great beyond the narrow bound  Of Earth's low walk that Judgment perfect found  When wanted most that Purity of Taste  Which Critics mention by the name of chaste  Adorn'd with Elegance that easy flow  Of ready Wit which never made a foe  That Face that Form that Dignity that Ease  Those pow'rs of pleasing with that will to please  By which LEPEL when in her youthful days  E'en from the currish POPE extorted praise  We see transmitted in her Daughter shine  And view a new LEPEL in CAROLINE  Is a son born into this world of woe  In neverceasing streams let sorrow flow  Be from that hour the house with sables hung  Let lamentations dwell upon thy tongue  E'en from the moment that he first began  To wail and whine let him not see a man  Lock Lock him up far from the public eye  Give him no opportunity to buy  Or to be bought B tho' rich was sold  And gave his body up to shame for gold  Let It be bruited all about the Town  That He is coarse indelicate and brown  An Antidote to Lust his Face deep scar'd  With the Small Pox his Body maim'd and marr'd  Eat up with the Kingsevil and his blood  Tainted throughout a thick and putrid flood  Where dwells Corruption making him all o'er  From head to foot a rank and running sore  Should'st Thou report him as by Nature made  He is undone and by thy praise betray'd  Give him out fair Letchers in number more  More brutal and more fierce than throng'd the door  Of Lor in SODOM shall to thine repair  And force a passage tho' a God is there  Let Him not have one Servant that is male  Where Lords are baffled Servants oft prevail  Some vices They propose to all agree  H was guilty but was M free  Give him no Tutorthrow him to a punk  Rather than trust his morals to a Monk  Monks we all knowWe who have liv'd at home  From fair report and Travellers who roam  More feelinglynor trust him to the gown  Tis oft a covering in this vile town  For base designs Ourselves have liv'd to see  More than one Parson in the Pillory  Should He have Brothers Image to thy view  A Scene which tho' not public made is true  Let not one Brother be to t'other known  Nor let his Father sit with him alone  Be all his Servants Female Young and Fair  And if the Pride of Nature spur thy heir  To deeds of Venery if hot and wild  He chance to get some score of maids with child  Chide but forgive him Whoredom is a crime  Which more at this than any other time  Calls for indulgence and 'mongst such a race  To have a bastard is some sign of grace  Born in such times should I sit tamely down  Suppress my rage and saunter thro' the town  As One who knew not or who shar'd these crimes  Should I at lesser evils point my rimes  And let this Giant Sin in the full eye  Of Observation pass unwounded by  Tho' our meek Wives passive Obedience taught  Patiently bear those wrongs for which They ought  With the brave spirit of their dams possess'd  To plant a dagger in each husband's breast  To cut off male increase from this fair Isle  And turn our Thames into another Nile  Tho' on his Sunday the smug PULPITEER  Loud 'gainst all other crimes is silent here  And thinks himself absolv'd in the pretence  Of Decency which meant for the defence  Of real Virtue and to raise her price  Becomes an agent for the cause of vice  Tho' the Law sleeps and thro' the care They take  To drug her well may never more awake  Born in such times nor with that patience curst  Which Saints may boast of I must speak or burst  But if too eager in my bold cariere  Haply I wound the nice and chaster ear  If all unguarded all too rude I speak  And call up blushes in the maiden's cheek  Forgive Ye Fairmy real motives view  And to forgiveness add your praises too  For You I writenor wish a better plan  The Cause of Woman is most worthy Man  For You I still will write nor hold my hand  Whilst there's one slave of SODOM in the land  Let them fly far and skulk from place to place  Not daring to meet Manhood face to face  Their steps I'll track nor yield them one retreat  Where They may hide their heads or rest their feet  Till God in wrath shall let his vengeance fall  And make a great example of them all  Bidding in one grand pile this Town expire  Her Tow'rs in dust her Thames a lake of fire  Or They most worth our wish convinc'd tho' late  Of their past crimes and dangerous estate  Pardon of Women with Repentance buy  And learn to honour them as
