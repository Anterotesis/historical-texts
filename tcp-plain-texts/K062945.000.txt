 THE ROSCIAD  PRICE ONE SHILLING AND SIXPENCE  THE ROSCIAD BY C CHURCHILL  Unknowing and unknown the hardy Muse  Boldly defies all mean and partial Views  With honest Freedom plays the Critic's Part  And praises as she censures from the Heart  THE SECOND EDITION Revised and Corrected with ADDITIONS  LONDON Printed for the AUTHOR and sold by W FLEXNEY near Gray'sInnGate Holborn MDCCLXI  THE ROSCIAD  _ROSCIUS deceased each high aspiring play'r  Push'd all his int'rest for the vacant chair  The buskin'd heroes of the mimic stage  No longer whine in love and rant in rage  The monarch quits his throne and condescends  Humbly to court the favour of his friends  For pity's sake tells undeserv'd mishaps  And their applause to gain recounts his claps  Thus the victorious chiefs of ancient Rome  To win the mob a suppliant's form assume  In pompous strain fight o'er th' extingui  And shew where honour bled in  BUT though bear merit might  'Tis not the strongest plea  We form our judgment in another way  And they will best succeed who best can pay  Those who would gain the votes of British tribes  Must add to force of merit force of bribes  WHAT can an actor give in ev'ry age  Cash hath

procession comes in just array  Now should I in some sweet poetic line  Offer up incense at APOLLO'S shrine  Invoke the Muse to quit her calm abode  And waken Mem'ry with a sleeping ode  For how should mortal man in mortal verse  Their titles merits or their names rehearse  But give kind Dullness Memory and Rhime  We'll put off Genius till another time  FIRST Order camewith solemn step and

By Fortune thrown on any other stage  He might perhaps have pleas'd an easy age  But now appears a copy and no more  Of something better we have seen before  The actor who would build a solid fame  Must Imitation's servile arts disclaim  Act from himself on his own bottom stand  I hate e'en GARRICK thus at second hand  BEHIND came K  GBred up in modest lore  Bashful and young he sought Hibernia's shore  Hibernia fam'd 'bove ev'ry other grace  For matchless intrepidity of face  From her his features caught the gen'rous flame  And bid defiance to all sense of shame  Tutor'd by all her

 Mimics draw humour out of Nature's fault  With personal defects their mirth adorn  And hang misfortunes out to public scorn  E'en I whom Nature cast in hideous mould  Whom having made she trembled to

Though rage and malice dim their faded cheek  What the Muse freely thinks she'll freely speak  With just disdain of ev'ry paltry sneer  Stranger alike to Flattery and Fear  In purpose fix'd and to

Which in attacking thee attacks the age  French follies universally embrac'd  At once provoke our mirth and form our taste  LONG from a nation ever hardly us'd  At random censur'd wantonly abus'd  Have Britons drawn their sport with partial view  Form'd gen'ral notions from the rascal few  Condemn'd a people as for vices known  Which from their country banish'd seek our own  At length howe'er

promiscuous go  Whom the Muse knows not nor desires to know  Vet'rans they seem'd but knew of arms no more  Than if till that time arms they never bore  Like Westminster militia train'd to fight  They

the mark  At Islington all by the placid stream  Where city swains in lap of Dullness dream  Where quiet as her strains their strains do flow  That all the patron by the bards may know  Secret as night with R  LT'S experienc'd aid  The plan of future operations laid  Projected schemes the summermonths to chear  And spin out happy Folly thro' the year  BUT think not though these dastard chiefs

talismans and charms  On one side Folly sits by some call'd Fun  And on the other his archpatron LUN  Behind for Liberty athirst in vain  Sense helpless captive drags the galling chain  Six rude mishapen beasts the chariot draw  Whom Reason loaths and Nature never saw  Monsters with tails of ice and heads of fire  Gorgons and hydras and chymaeras dire  Each was bestrode by full as monstrous wight  Giant Dwarf Genius Elf Hermaphrodite  The Town as usual met him in full cry  The Town as usual knew no reason why  But Fashion so directs and Moderns raise  On Fashion's mould'ring base their

giggling plotting chambermaids arrive  Hoydens and Romps led on by Gen'ral CLIVE  In spight of outward blemishes she shone  For Humour fam'd and Humour all her own  Easy as if at home the stage she

merit or more praise  WITH all the native vigour of sixteen  Among the merry troop conspicuous seen  See lively POPE advance in jig and trip  Corinna Cherry Honeycomb and Snip  Not without Art but yet to Nature true  She charms the Town with Humour just yet new  Chear'd by her promise we the less deplore  The fatal time when CLIVE shall be no more  MIGHT Figure give a title unto Fame  WHAT rival should with Y  T  S dispute her claim  But Justice may not partial trophies raise  Nor sink the Actress in the Woman's praise  Still hand in hand her words and actions go  And the heart feels more than the features shew  For through the regions of that beauteous face  We no variety of passions trace  Dead to the soft emotions of the heart  No kindred softness can those eyes impart  The brow still fix'd in Sorrow's gloomy frame  Void of distinction marks all parts the same  WHAT'S a fine person or a beauteous face  Unless Deportment gives it decent grace  Bless'd with all other requisites to please  Some want the striking elegance of Ease  The curious eye their awkward movement tires  They seem like puppets led about by wires  Others like statues in one posture still  Give great ideas of the workman's skill  Wond'ring his art we praise the more we view  And only grieve he gave not motion too  Weak of themselves are what we beauties call  It is the Manner which gives strength to all  This teaches ev'ry beauty to unite  And brings them forward in the noblest light  Happy in this behold amidst the throng  With transient gleam of grace H  T sweeps along  FORM'D for the tragic scene to grace the stage  With rival excellence of Love and Rage  Mistress of each soft art with matchless skill  To turn and wind the passions as she will  To melt the heart with sympathetic woe  Awake the sigh and teach the tear to flow  To put on Frenzy's wild distracted glare  And freeze the soul with horror and despair  With just desert enroll'd in endless fame  Conscious of worth superior C  BB  R came  WHEN poor ALICIA'S madding brains are rackd  And strongly imag'd griefs her mind distract  Struck with her grief I catch the madness too  My brain turns round The headless trunk I view  The roof cracks shakes and fallsNew horrors rise  And Reason buried in the ruin lies  NOBLY disdainful of each slavish art  She makes her first attack upon the heart  Pleas'd with the summons it receives her laws  And all is silence sympathy applause  BUT when by fond Ambition drawn aside  Giddy with praise and puff'd with female pride  She quits the tragic scene and in pretence  To comic merit breaks down Nature's fence  I scarcely can believe my ears and eyes  Or find out C  BB  R through the dark disguise  PRITCHARD by Nature for the stage design'd  In person graceful and in sense refin'd  Her Art as much as Nature's friend became  Her voice as free from blemish as her fame  Who knows so well in majesty to please  Attemper'd with the graceful charms of ease  WHEN CONGREVE'S favour'd pantomine to grace  She comes a captive queen of Moorish race  When Love Hate Jealousy Despair and Rage  With wildest tumults in her breast engage  Still equal to herself is Zara seen  Her passions are the passions of a queen  WHEN she to murther whets the tim'rous Thane  I feel Ambition rush through ev'ry vein  Persuasion hangs upon her daring tongue  My heart grows flint and ev'ry nerve's new strung  IN comedy"Nay there" cries critic "hold  " PRITCHARD'S for comedy too fat and old  " Who can with patience bear the grey coquette  " Or force a laugh with overgrown Julett  " Her speech look action humour all are just  " But then her age and figure give disgust"  ARE foibles then and graces of the mind  In real life to size or age confin'd  Do spirits flow and is goodbreeding plac'd  In any set circumference of waist  As we grow old doth affectation cease  Or gives not age new vigour to caprice  If in originals these things appear  Why should we bar them in the copy here  THE nice punctiliomongers of this age  The grand minute reformers of the stage  Slaves to propriety of ev'ry kind  Some standardmeasure for each part should find  Which when the best of actors shall exceed  Let it devolve to one of smaller breed  ALL actors too upon the back should bear  Certificate of birthtime whenplace where  For how can critics rightly fix their worth  Unless they know the minute of their birth  An audience too deceived may find too late  That they have clapp'd an actor out of date  FIGURE I own at first may give offence  And harshly strike the eye's too curious sense  But when perfections of the mind break forth  Humour's chaste sallies Judgment's solid worth  When the pure genuine flame by Nature taught  Springs into Sense and ev'ry action's Thought  Before such merit all objections fly  PRITCHARD'S genteel and GARRICK six feet high  OFT have I PRITCHARD seen thy wond'rous skill  Confess'd thee great but find thee greater still  T  worth which shone in scatter'd rays

enchanted lance  With which her heroes arm'd victorious prove  And like a flood rush o'er the land of Love  M  SS  P and B  R  Y cameNames ne'er design'd  By Fate in the same sentence to be join'd  RAIS'D by the breath of popular acclaim  They mounted to the pinnacle of Fame  There the weak brain made giddy with the height  Spur'd on the rival chiefs to mortal fight  Thus sportive boys around some bason's brim  Behold the pipedrawn bladders circling swim  But if from lungs more potent there arise  Two bubbles of a more than common size  Eager for honour they for fight prepare  Bubble meets bubble and both sink to air  M  SS  P attach'd to military plan  Still kept his eye fix'd on his righthand man  Whilst the mouth measures words with seeming skill  The right hand labours and the left lies still  For he resolv'd on scripturegrounds to go  What the right doth the left hand shall not know  With studied impropriety of speech  He soars beyond the hackney critic's reach  To epithets allots emphatic state  Whilst principals ungrac'd like lacquies wait  In ways first trodden by himself excels  And stands alone in indeclinables  Conjunction preposition adverb join  To stamp new vigour on the nervous line  In monosyllables his thunders roll  He she it and we ye they fright the soul  IN person taller than the common size  Behold where B  Y draws admiring eyes  When lab'ring passions in his bosom pent  Convulsive rage and struggling heave for vent  Spectators with imagin'd terrors warm  Anxious expect the bursting of the storm  But all unfit in such a pile to dwell  His voice comes forth like Echo from her cell  To swell the tempest needful aid denies  And all adown the stage in feeble murmurs dies  WHAT man like B  Y with such pains can err  In elocution action character  What man could give if B  Y was not here  Such wellapplauded tenderness to Lear  Who else can speak so very very fine  That Sense may kindly end with ev'ry line  SOME dozen lines before the ghost is there  Behold him for the solemn scene prepare  See how he frames his eyes poises each limb  Puts the whole body into proper trim  From whence we learn with no great stretch of art  Five lines hence comes a ghost and ha a start  WHEN he appears most perfect still we find  Something which jars upon and hurts the mind  Whatever lights upon a part are thrown  We see too plainly they are not his own  No flame from Nature ever yet he caught  Nor knew a feeling which he was not taught  He rais'd his trophies on the base of art  And conn'd his passions as he conn'd his part  Q  N from afar lur'd by the scent of Fame  A StageLeviathan put in his claim  Pupil of BETTERTON and BOOTH Alone  Sullen he walk'd and deem'd the chair his own  For how should moderns mushrooms of the day  Who ne'er those masters knew know how to play  GRAYBEARDED vet'rans who with partial tongue  Extol the times when they themselves were young  Who having lost all relish for the stage  See not their own defects but lash the age  Receiv'd with joyful murmurs of applause  Their darling chief and lin'd his fav'rite cause  FAR be it from the candid Muse to tread  Insulting o'er the ashes of the dead  But just to living merit she maintains  And dares the test whilst GARRICK'S Genius reigns  Ancients in vain endeavour to excel  Happily prais'd if they could act as well  BUT though Prescription's force we disallow  Nor to Antiquity submissive bow  Though we deny imaginary grace  Founded on accidents of time and place  Yet real worth of ev'ry growth shall bear  Due praise nor dare we Q  N forget thee there  His words bore sterling weight nervous and strong  In manly tides of sense they roll'd along  Happy in art he chiefly had pretence  To keep up Numbers yet not forfeit Sense  No actor ever greater heights could reach  In all the labour'd artifice of speech  SPEECH Is that all And shall an actor found  An universal fame on partial ground  Parrots themselves speak properly by rote  And in six months my dog shall howl by note  I laugh at those who when the Stage they tread  Neglect the heart to compliment the head  With strict propriety their care's confin'd  To weigh out words while Passion halts behind  To Syllabledissectors they appeal  Allow them accent cadenceFools may feel  But spite of all the criticising elves  Those who would make us feel must feel themselves  His eyes in gloomy socket taught to roll  Proclaim'd the sullen habit of his soul  Heavy and phlegmatic he trod the Stage  Too proud for tenderness too dull for rage  WHEN Hector's lovely widow shines in tears  Or Rowe's gay Rake dependant Virtue jeers  With the same cast of features he is seen  To chide the Libertine and court the Queen  FROM the tame scene which without passion flows  With just desert his reputation rose  Nor less he pleas'd when on some surly plan  He was at once the Actor and the Man  IN Brute he shone unequall'd all agree  GARRICK'S not half so great a Brute as he  When Cato's labour'd scenes are brought to view  With equal praise the Actor labour'd too  For still you'll find trace passions to their root  Small diff'rence 'twixt the Stoic and the Brute  IN fancied scenes as in life's real plan  He could not for a moment sink the Man  In whate'er cast his character was laid  Self still like oil upon the surface play'd  Nature in spite of all his skill crept in  Horatio Dorax Falstaffstill 'twas Q  N  NEXT follows SH  R  D  NA doubtful name  As yet unsettled in the rank of Fame  This fondly lavish in his praises grown  Gives him all merit That allows him none  Between them both we'll steer the middle course  Nor loving Praise rob Judgment of her force  JUST his conceptions natural and great  His feelings strong his words enforc'd with weight  Was speechfam'd Q  N himself to hear him speak  Envy would drive the colour from his cheek  But stepdame Nature niggard of her grace  Deny'd the social pow'rs of voice and face  Fix'd in one frame of features glare of eye  Passions like Chaos in confusion lie  In vain the wonders of his skill are try'd  To form Distinction Nature hath deny'd  His voice no touch of harmony admits  Irregularly deep and shrill by fits  The two extremes appear like man and wife  Coupled together for the sake of strife  His Action's always strong but sometimes such  That Candour must declare he acts too much  Why must Impatience fall three paces back  Why paces three return to the attack  Why is the right leg too forbid to stir  Unless in motion semicircular  Why must the Heroe with the Nailor vie  And hurl the closeclench'd fist at nose or eye  IN Royal John with Philip angry grown  I thought he would have knock'd poor D  V  S down  Inhuman tyrant was it not a shame  To fright a king so harmless and so tame  BUT spight of all defects his glories rise  And Art by Judgment form'd with Nature vies  Behold him sound the depth of HUBERT'S soul  Whilst in his own contending passions roll  View the whole scene with critic judgment scan  And thendeny him Merit if you can  Where he falls short 'tis Nature's fault alone  Where he succeds the Merit's all his own  LAST GARRICK cameBehind him throng a train  Of snarling critics ignorant as vain  ONE finds out"He's of stature somewhat low  " Your Heroe always should be tall you know  " True nat'ral greatness all consists in height"  Produce your voucher Critic"Serjeant KYTE"  ANOTHER can't forgive the paltry arts  By which he makes his way to shallow hearts  Mere pieces of finesse traps for applause  " Avant unnat'ral start affected pause"  FOR me by Nature form'd to judge with phlegm  I can't acquit by wholesale nor condemn  The best things carried to excess are wrong  The start may be too frequent pause too long  But only us'd in proper time and place  Severest judgment must allow them Grace  IF Bunglers form'd on Imitation's plan  Just in the way that Monkies mimic Man  Their copied scene with mangled arts disgrace  And pause and start with the same vacant face  We join the critic laugh those tricks we scorn  Which spoil the scenes they mean them to adorn  BUT when from Nature's pure and genuine source  These strokes of acting flow with gen'rous force  When in the features all the soul's portray'd  And passions such as GARRICK'S are display'd  To me they seem from quickest feelings caught  Each start is Nature and each pause is Thought  WHEN Reason yields to Passion's wild alarms  And the whole state of Man is up in arms  What but a Critic could condemn the Play'r  For pausing here when Cool Sense pauses there  Whilst working from the heart the fire I trace  And mark it strongly flaming to the face  Whilst in each sound I hear the very man  I can't catch words and pity those who can  LET Wits like Spiders from the
