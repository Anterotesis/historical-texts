 The Importance of RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE to the Happiness of Mankind A SERMON PREACHED BEFORE The SOCIETY for propagating CHRISTIAN KNOWLEDGE At their Anniversary Meeting IN The HIGH CHURCH of  Edinburgh  ON  Monday January  And published at their DESIRE  By HUGH BLAIR AM One of the Ministers of  Canongate  To which is subjoin'd A short Account of the PRESENT STATE of the SOCIETY  EDINBURGH  Printed by R FLEMING for A KINCAID MDCCL  A SERMON PREACHED IN The HIGHCHURCH of  Edinburgh  BEFORE The SOCIETY for propagating CHRISTIAN KNOWLEDGE  ISAIAH xi  They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy Mountain For the Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord as the Waters cover the Sea  THIS Passage of Scripture is understood by all Christian Interpreters to refer to the Days of the Gospel The Prophet is describing in the Context the Influence of the  Messiah  's Reign extending thro' all Nature and producing universal Happiness This in its full Accomplishment doubtless is yet future and respects some more advanced Period  of the Kingdom of God foretold in other Passages of the prophetick Writings when true Religion shall universally prevail and the native Tendency of the Gospel attain its entire Effect In the Prospect of this the Prophet seems to rise above himself and celebrates those happy Days in the most sublime figurative Strain of Eastern Poetry He opens a beautiful View of the State of the World as a State of returning Innocence He represents all Nature flourishing in Peace Discord and Guile abolished the most hostile Natures reconciled and the most savage tamed and reformed  The Wolf also shall dwell with the Lamb and the Leopard shall ly down with the Kid And the Calf and the young Lion and the Fatling together and a little Child shall lead them And the Cow and the Bear shall feed their young Ones shall ly down together and the Lion shall eat Straw like the Ox and the sucking Child shall play on the Hole of the Asp and the weaned Child shall put his Hand on the Cockatrice Den They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy Mountain For  assigning in the Text the Cause of this great and happy Revolution  the Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord as the Waters cover the Sea  UPON reading these Words we must immediately perceive the great  Encouragement  they give to all good Designs for promoting Religion in the World When we engage in this Cause we have the Comfort not only of being engaged in a  good  Cause but also in one that will undoubtedly be  successful  For we are here assured by the Divine Promise that Truth and Goodness shall at length prevail and the increasing Light and Influence of Religion prove the Cause of general Order and Happiness It is a noble and animating Thought that in such Designs we cooperate with God for advancing the Kingdom of the  Messiah  and work upon his Plan with all the Force of eternal Providence on our Side Nor ought we to be discouraged by those unfavourable Circumstances which at present seem to make against us Tho' the Ignorance Superstition and Corruption that now fill so much of the World have a dark and mysterious Aspect it is not beyond the Power of that supreme Being who brings Light out of Darkness to unravel all those perplexed Appearances and gradually to extricate Mankind from the Labyrinth of Vice and Error From the  present  State of the World it is not more unlikely that the Gospel shall one Day be universally received and exert its  entire  Influence on the Hearts of Men than  once  it was that it should reach  so far  and demolish  so much  established Superstition as it has  already  done At the Rise of Christianity there was as great a Disproportion betwixt the apparent human Causes and the Effect which has been  actually  produced as there is in our Times betwixt the Circumstances of Religion in the World and the Effect which we  farther  expect The  Sun of Righteousness  having exerted its Influence so far in breaking thro' the thickest Darkness we may justly hope that it is powerful enough to dispel all remaining Obscurity and that it will ascend by Degrees to that  perfect Day  when  Healing shall be under its Wings  to all the Nations  A little One shall become a Thousand and a small One a strong Nation I the Lord will hasten it in its Time  Isa lx    BESIDES this  Encouragement  to our Endeavours for advancing Religion there is to be observed in the Text a precise  Connection  marked  betwixt the Increase of religious Knowledge and the Happiness of Mankind  The Knowledge of the Lord filling the Earth  is distinctly assigned as the  Cause  why  they shall not hurt nor destroy in all God's holy Mountain  To this I am principally to lead your Thoughts as a Subject properly suited to the Occasion of our Meeting and peculiarly  necessary  as I conceive to be inculcated in the present Times which seem to be waxing indifferent more and more to all religious Principles Whether Christianity shall be propagated further or not is treated as a Matter of no great Concern to Mankind Opinions prevail that moral Virtue may subsist with equal Advantage independent of Religion For  moral Principles  great Regard is pretended But  Articles of religious Belief  are thought abstract Things remote from Life Points of mere Speculation and Debate of very inconsiderable Influence on the Actions of Men The general Conduct of Mankind it is argued will always proceed upon Principles and Views of another Nature and therefore religious Knowledge stands in no necessary Connection with their Improvement or Happiness Fact and Experience is alledged for  this Even amongst many who would not be ranged on the Side of Unbelief this loose and indifferent Spirit too much prevails and hence the Profession of Religion amongst us is too visibly sinking into Disrepute How adverse all this is to the Design which the present Discourse is intended to recommend needs not be said How adverse it is to the general Welfare and most real Interests of Mankind I hope shall be made evident to candid Minds  BY the  Knowledge of the Lord  is not to be understood the natural Knowledge of God only It is plain the Prophet speaks of those Times of the  Messiah  when more enlarged Discoveries should be made to Mankind of the Divine Perfections and of the Measures of the Divine Administration than mere unassisted Reason could reach Our natural Notices of God and Religion are not laid aside by Christianity but cleared from Error confirmed by higher Evidence and carried into a wider Field In this  enlarged  Sense of religious Knowledge to make its Importance to the Happiness of Mankind appear let us consider Man  I As an  Individual  AND II As a  Member of Society  I CONSIDERING Man in his single Capacity as an  Individual  our Inquiry shall here begin of what  Importance  it is to him to have just and true Principles of religious Belief This divides itself unto two grand Branches With respect first to his  Improvement  and next to his  Consolation  As to the real  Improvement  of Man the Advancement of his Nature in what is morally valuable and useful the Acquisition of such Dispositions and Habits as fit him for acting his Part well on this Stage and prepare him for a higher State of Life and Action hereafter What Benefit does he receive in these Respects from religious Knowledge and Belief It must be obvious that all Increase of Knowledge is Improvement to the  Understanding  The further its Sphere extends the more Objects that are submitted to its View and Contemplation especially when those Objects are of intrinsick  Excellence  the more that understanding Power which is the Glory of Man  is in the Course of attaining its proper Strength and Maturity Hence  Truth  is justly said to be  the Food of the Soul  But were the Knowledge of Religion merely speculative tho' the Speculation must be allowed to be noble yet less could be said of its Importance We recommend it to Mankind as forming their  Hearts  Pure and exalted Conceptions of the Deity such as Religion gives usThe universal Father and righteous Governor of the Universethe Author of  every good and perfect Gift  himself the Standard of unspotted Perfection and Goodnessconducting his whole Administration with an eternal Regard to Order Virtue and Truthever favouring the Cause and supporting the Interests of Righteousness and righteous Menand applying to this the whole Force of Omnipotence and the whole Art of unerring Wisdom from the Beginning to the End of ThingsSuch Conceptions of the Deity naturally descend into the Heart kindle in it the  Love  of Goodness and establish a Persuasion of its being our highest  Interest  They give a peculiar  Strength  and  Fortitude  to the Mind in the Practice of Virtue and they promote a chearful  Acquiescence  in this supremely  wise and righteous Administration  whatever  Trials and Sufferings may arise  ALL the Doctrines  peculiar  to Christian Revelation are great Improvements of what the Light of Nature imperfectly suggests A Dispensation of Providence is made known to us particularly suited to the Exigencies of Man Calculated for recovering him from that corrupt and guilty State into which  Experience  bears Witness that he is fallen and restoring him to a State of Integrity and Favour with his Creator The Method of carrying on this great Plan is such as gives us the most affecting Views of the  Importance  of Holiness and Goodness and of the  high Account  in which it stands with God The Son of God appearing on the Earth and dying as a  Propitiation for the Sins of the World  that he might  bring in everlasting Righteousness  Dan ix  that he might  purge our Consciences from dead Works to serve the living God  Heb ix    that he might redeem us from all Iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar People zealous of good Works  Tit ii  Such a gracious and merciful Interposition of the Creator of the  World so distinguishing a Proof of his Concern for the moral Interests of Mankind is most proper to warm the Heart with  Devotion  and  adds  to the Cause of Goodness the Force of every Motive from  Gratitude  and ingenuous Affection These Discoveries of the Gospel have this further Effect to establish an unshaken Confidence in God They afford something to the Mind on which it can lay hold as the  Security  of its Hope when with a Certainty far beyond that of mere  abstract Argument  it appeals to  Matter of Fact  and is taught to say  He that spared not his own Son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all Things  Rom viii  Hence the great Encouragement to the  Repentance  and Reformation of Sinners from the Hope of Acceptance with God thro' JESUS CHRIST and from the Belief of a Divine Assistance communicated to the Upright in Heart Whilst the Government of God is thus rendered most  amiable  placed in a Light most encouraging to every virtuous Mind there is at the same Time something extremely  awful  and  solemn  in the whole Doctrine of the  Redemption  It  naturally strikes the Mind with Reverence for the Divine Law pointing at some  deep  Malignity in Sin some dreadful Consequences flowing from it  unknown  perhaps in their Causes and in their  whole  Extent to the human Mind which moved the Creator of the World to depart from the ordinary Laws of Providence and to undertake the Restoration of guilty Creatures by a Method so astonishing Hence Mankind are  awakened  to serious Reflection Hence such Views arise of the Laws under which they are placed and of the Ends of Being they are bound to fulfil as give  Solemnity  to Virtue and restrain them from trifling with Life Especially when to this is joined the Discovery of  Life and Immortality  by the Gospel the Connection in which this Life stands with a future eternal State for which we are now under Probation in a Course of Discipline which according as by Divine Assistance it terminates in our Improvement in Virtue or thro' our own Misconduct leaves us in a corrupt unimproved State will dismiss us to lasting Abodes either of Punishment or Reward This is far above those faint interrupted Hopes those feeble ineffectual Reasonings which mere natural  Light suggests concerning the future Condition of Mankind Here we find what alone can be of any considerable Weight with Men in Practicedirect Promise and Threatningan authoritative Sanction given to a Lawthe Governor revealedand the Motives addressed to Hope and Fear urged home on the Mind by  Thus saith the Lord of Hosts  Nor are Circumstances wanting to impress the  Imagination  in the liveliest Manner The Resurrection of the Body the Solemnity of a future Judgment the decisive Sentence the final Separation and the everlasting Mansions of the Good and the Bad are all set forth in strong and affecting Colours In short a great and magnificent  Plan  of Divine Administration is in Part opened and nothing is omitted that may give Mankind the deepest Sense of their being all the Subjects of the  moral Government  of God  THE Bounds of this Discourse have allowed me to give but an imperfect View of the great Principles of Religion From these Hints however we may recollect so much of the Christian Doctrine as will be a sufficient Foundation for an Appeal to every impartial Mind whether  the  Knowledge  the real and firm  Belief  of these Principles of Religion be not strictly connected with the  Improvement  of Man and thereby of the highest Importance to his  Happiness  I reason now with those who admit that to be virtuous and good is real Improvement and Happiness Let them lay what Stress they will upon Conscience upon its natural Authority within and the Force and Evidence of its Dictates Obstinate sure they must be who will not grant that the natural Tendency of these religious Principles is to  support  the Dictates and  confirm  the Authority of Conscience to  awaken  on various Occasions the most useful Feelings to provide  additional  Restraints from Vice and  additional  Motives to every Virtue Who dares say that there is no Case in which Conscience stands in real  Need  of such Assistance to  direct  where there is so much Uncertainty and Darkness and to  prompt  where there is so much Feebleness and Irresolution and such a fatal Proneness to Vice and Folly  BUT how good soever the  Tendency  of religious Principles may be their  actual  Significancy and Influence on Life will still be called in  Question This  Tendency  is by various Causes defeated Betwixt the  Belief  of religious Principles and correspondent  Practice  it will be said that Experience shows there is no necessary Connection nor can the Propagation of the  one  at all assure us that proportionable Improvements will follow in the  other  This is in Part allowed As we allow that Knowledge and Belief admit of various Degrees before they arrive at that Christian Faith which the Scripture represents as certainly  purifying the Heart  But tho' the Connection be not  necessary  betwixt Knowledge and Practice I hope it will not be denied that  some  Connection there is Here there is  one  Avenue to the Heart If the  Tendency  of religious Knowledge be good Wisdom must direct and Duty oblige us to cultivate it For  Tendency  will at least in  some  Cases become  effectual  in  more  Cases probably than are taken notice of amidst the Hurry of the World Besides the  known  and  distinguished  Examples of true Religion and Virtue which in every Age of Christianity have shone more or less as  Lights of the World  How many may there be in the more  silent  Scenes of Life overlooked by superficial Observers of  Mankind on whose Hearts and Lives religious Principles have a great and happy Influence Even on loose and giddy Minds where they are far from operating their full Effect their Influence is not altogether lost Religious Principles are at least a  Clog  on Vice in its Career they stop it from going its  full  Length and tho' they do not entirely reform the Mind are however the Means of preserving external Order and giving a Check to open Profligateness and Dissolution of Manners Men that are now  bad  might probably have been  worse  without them and the World have suffered more from their Licentiousness Besides they often sow latent Seeds of Goodness in the Heart which proper Circumstances and Occasions ripen when the Reformation of the Offender perhaps is not so conspicuous to the World as his former bad Manners have been From the  native  Tendency of religious Knowledge there is Reason to believe that those good Effects of it are not  so rare  as some would persuade us especially when we consider it as accompanied with a  Divine Blessing  By the Nature and plain Tendency of a Thing it is more reasonable to judge of it than to lay the  whole  Stress on Observations drawn from a  supposed  Experience which often is narrow in its Compass and fallacious in its Conclusions One great Cause of the Tendency of Religion being often defeated certainly is that the Knowledge of Divine Things is not thoroughly imbibed nor the Belief of them fully received Were a just Sense and a firm Persuasion of them more general amongst Men we may rationally hope their good Effects would more extensively appear  I ADMIT indeed that mere Knowledge will prove unavailing against the Power of  Temper  and settled  Habits  These 'tis said govern the Life of Men far more than religious Belief and will be too hard for all Principles whatever Perhaps this is said with Truth But then we ought to consider that it is the Nature of Religion to work itself gradually into the Affections to acquire the  Dominion  of the Temper and so to give Rise to Habits of acting Hence the Perfection of religious Influence is with great Justice and Propriety described in Scripture by a  new Heart and a new Spirit  when the Mind is not involuntarily constrained by  Principle but Principle forms the inward Constitution and becomes in a Manner the  same  with Temper and Affection  BUT the  actual  Influence of Principle and Belief on Mankind admits of further Illustration from  uncontested  Matter of Fact They who hold the good Influence of Christian Principles to be  so inconsiderable  as to render the Propagation of them of no great Importance will be at no Loss to give us Instances of corrupt and wrong Principles having had a  great  Influence on the World Loud Complaints we hear from this Quarter of the direful  Effects  which  Superstition  and  Enthusiasm  have produced how they have  poisoned  the Tempers and  transformed  the Manners of Men and have  overcome  the strongest Restraints of Law of Reason and HumanityIs this then the Case that  all  Principles  except good ones  are supposed to be of such mighty  Energy  Strange that false Religion should do  so much  and true Religion  so little  No impartial Inquirer sure can be of such an absurd Opinion The whole History of Mankind shows that religious Belief is no inconsiderable Principle of  Action The Mischief such Belief has done when misled is indeed a good Argument to be on our Guard against Error But as it is a Proof of what Belief  can  do it is an Argument to hope the more from it when rightly directed The  same  Torrent that overflows and lays waste a Country when put out of its natural Course enriches the Soil when it runs in its proper Bed If it be alledged that  Superstition  is the more powerful Principle by falling in with the weak and corrupt Propensities of Mankind it may be opposed to this that  Truth  has the Divine Blessing and the Countenance of Heaven on its Side Let us always hope well of a Cause that is good in itself and beneficial to Mankind Truth is mighty and will prevail Let us spread the  incorruptible Seed  as widely as we can and trust in God that  he will give the Increase  So much for the Importance of religious Knowledge to every Individual in the Way of  Improvement  Let us next consider  WHAT it promises in the Way of  Consolation  of Aid and Relief to Man amidst the Distresses of Life Here it must be allowed by  all that Religion triumphs and its valuable Influence in this Respect must be a strong Argument to every benevolent Mind for wishing that Influence to be further spread thro' the World For without religious Principle and Hope Man is a Creature  miserable  and  forlorn  He finds himself here a  Stranger  in a wide World where the Powers and Operations of Nature are very imperfectly known where both the Causes and the Issues of Things are wrapt up in much Darkness where he is quite at a Loss or at best can form only an uncertain Guess whence he comes for what Purpose he was brought unto this State of Being and whither he is to go when he departs from hence What a  disconsolate  Situation is this to a serious inquiring Mind Even tho' it were in a Man's Power to fill up the Hours of Life with perpetual Amusement void of Care Life enjoyed on such Terms would upon Reflection appear  poor  and  trifling  But how much  worse  when we consider the real Condition of Man a Being frail and feeble beset with various Dangers and Ills and exposed to many a melancholy Reflection when he sees all Things around him so transitory and decaying and  meets with  Disappointment  and  Sorrow  with  Vanity  and  Vexation  in all the Paths of Life In this distressed Condition to reveal to him such Discoveries of God and his Administration as the Christian Religion affords is to reveal to him a  Father  and a  Friend  is to let in a Ray of most comforting Light upon the Darkness of human Estate He who was before a destitute Orphan wandering in the inhospitable Desart has now gained a Shelter from the bitter and inclement Blast He now knows to  whom  to pray and in  whom  to trust  where  to unbosom his Sorrows from  what  Hand to look for Relief Certain it is that when the Heart bleeds from some Wound of recent Misfortune there is nothing of equal Efficacy with religious Comfort It is of Power to chear the darkest Hours and to asswage the deepest Woe by the Belief of Divine Favour and the Prospect of happy Immortality Here the Mind expatiates with Joy and when bereaved of all its earthly Friends solaces itself with the Thoughts of  One  Friend that will never forsake it These Views have a greater and better Effect on the Heart of a plain but sincere  Christian  than all the Refinements of Philosophy  have on the  Learned  Refined Reasonings may please and amuse the Mind when it is at Ease may perhaps help to relieve it when slightly touched with Sorrow but when it is torn with any sore Distress they are  cold  and  feeble  compared with a direct  Promise  from the Word of God This is  an Anchor to the Soul both sure and stedfast  This has given  Refuge and strong Consolation  to many a pious and virtuous Soul at a Time when mere  Reasonings  would have proved utterly unavailing Besides that they can never be so accommodated to the Bulk of Mankind as to be  generally  useful this great Disadvantage attends them that they raise more  Perplexities  in an  inquiring  Mind than it is in their Power to resolve Upon the Approach of  Death  especially this will be felt when if a Man thinks at all his Anxiety must naturally increase about the future Concerns of his Soul  Then  it is that the great Importance of the Discoveries of the Gospel will appear Not only  Life and Immortality  brought to Light but the Path opened that leads to Life A  Mediator  discovered  Mercy  proclaimed by the Governor of the World thro' this Mediator to the Frailties and Errors of those who are penitent  humble and sincere in Heart and the  Presence  of their Redeemer promised to conduct them thro' the Valley of the Shadow of Death to unseen Habitations of Rest and Glory where he hath prepared their Place Here is Ground for good Men's leaving the World with  Comfort  and  Peace  But in this  severe  and  trying  Period this  labouring  Hour of Nature how shall the wretched Man support himself who believes not or knows not the Hope of ReligionSecretly conscious to himself that he has not acted the Part he ought the Failings and Vices of his past Life arise before him in sad Remembrance He  wishes  to exist after Death and yet is  afraid  of that Existence The Governor of the World is  unknown  His Mercy for any thing that he can tell may be implored  in vain  all is mysterious Obscurity And in the midst of endless Perplexities and Doubts the trembling Soul is forced away from the BodyAs the Misfortunes of Life must have been insupportable to such a Man so its End is bitter His setting Sun goes down in a dark Cloud and the Night of Death closes over his Head full of Misery  Having no Hope  and  being without God  that  is without the Knowledge of God  in the World  are two Things most justly connected by the Apostle when he is describing the Misery of the Heathen Nations  Eph ii  Thus by Means of  the Knowledge of the Lord  Man considered as an  Individual  is both  improved  and  comforted  We are next to show  II WHAT Benefit he receives from this Knowledge as a  Member of Society  This Branch of the Subject is in Part anticipated by what has been already said For all the  Improvement  that Man as an  Individual  receives from religious Knowledge redounds to the Benefit of the  Publick  Society reaps the Fruits of the Virtue of all its Members and as  each  apart is made better the  whole  must proportionably flourish But besides this religious Knowledge has a  direct  Tendency to improve the social Intercourses of Men and to assist them in cooperating for common Good  FOR first of all it  forms  them for Society It  civilizes  Mankind It tames the Fierceness of their Passions and wears off the Barbarity of their Manners Without some Notions of Religion  it is much to be questioned whether any regular Society ever subsisted or could subsist in the World All those who in early Times attempted to reduce wandering and scattered Men unto Society found it necessary to begin with some Institution of Religion And the wisest Legislators of old thro' the whole Progress of their Systems of Government treated it as necessary and essential to Civil Polity If even those  imperfect  Forms of Religion mixed with so much Error were important to Society  how much more  that reasonable and true Worship of God which the Gospel teaches True Religion introduces the Idea of regular Subjection by accustoming Mankind to the  Awe  of superior Power in the Deity  joined  with the  Esteem  of superior Wisdom and Goodness It is by its Natnre an  associating  Principle creating new and sacred Bonds of Union amongst Men Common Assemblies for religious Worship and the joint Veneration of one God the Sense of being all in common dependent on the same supreme Protection and bound by the same Ties to Duty Sharers of the same Benefits of Religion and Expectants of the same Reward all this has a Tendency  to awaken the Sense of our friendly Relation to knit us together and strengthen our mutual Connection  FURTHER religious Knowledge assists in preparing the Way for all useful and ornamental Improvements in Society It has in Fact been found that along with the Increase of  religious  Light  Learning  has flourished and useful  Arts  have been cultivated and advanced The true Knowledge of the Lord promotes a  free  and  manly  Spirit It teaches Men to think for themselves to form their Principles upon a a fair Inquiry unto the Word of God and not to resign their Consciences implicitely to Men Hence it is strongly connected with a Detestation of Oppression of every kind and forms a Taste for  Liberty  and  Laws  We see that tyrannical Governments have taken the firmest Root in Nations blinded by  Mahometan  and  Pagan  Darkness where the Throne of Violence is  supported  by Ignorance and Error In the Christian World as long as  Popish  Superstition reigned undisturbed  Darkness Oppression  and  Slavery  were in its Train For some Centuries the Cloud sat  thick  and  deep  over all  Europe  and threatned a Relapse unto ancient Barbarity Till at the auspicious Aera of the  Reformation  together with the true  Knowledge of the Lord Learning Liberty  and  Arts  began to shine forth and resume their Lustre At this Day the  Protestant Religion  is in our own and some other States the great Bulwark of  Liberty  The Promoters of arbitrary Power know this well and hence it has been their constant Aim to bear it down and in place of the  Knowledge of the Lord  to establish an  implicit  Submission to the Dictates of  Men  in Matters of Religion  BUT this is not the whole of that happy Influence which religious Knowledge hath on Society It is not only subsidiary to its  Improvement  but necessary to its  Preservation  It is the very  Basis  on which it rests For religious Principle is what gives Mankind the surest Hold of one another That last and greatest Pledge of Veracity an  Oath  without which no Society can subsist derives its whole Authority from the Reverence of God to whom it is a solemn Appeal Banish religious Principle and you loosen all the Bonds of Society  You shake the fundamental Pillar of all mutual Trust and Confidence amongst Men nay you destroy the Security arising from  Laws  themselves For human Laws and human Sanctions cannot extend to numberless Cases in which the Safety of Mankind is highly concerned They would be very ineffectual Means of maintaining the Order and Peace of Society if there were no Checks upon Men from the Sense of Divine Legislation if no Belief of Divine Rewards and Punishments were to come in Aid of what human Rewards and Punishments so imperfectly provide for  INDEED the Belief of Religion is of such Importance to publick Welfare that the most expressive Description we could give of a Society in the utmost Circumstances of Disorder would be to say There was no  Fear of God  left amongst themOur Imagination would immediately conceive of them as loose and lawless abandoned to Rapine and Violence to Perfidy and Treachery deceiving and deceived oppressing and opprest consumed by intestine Broils and ripe for becoming a Prey to the first InvaderOn the other hand in order to any  Society's flourishing in its highest  Perfection  and  Glory  we need only suppose the Belief of Christian Principles prevailing in such a Degree as to exert their  entire  Influence on the Hearts and Lives of all its Members  Then  would the most amiable Scene open We would see the  Causes  of publick Disunion instantly removed when Men were once formed to the Pursuit of those higher Interests which give no Occasion to  Competitions  and  Jealousies  and warmed in Heart with that noble Spirit of  Love  which our holy Religion breathes and of which it hath set before us such illustrious Examples in Almighty God and our blessed Redeemer We would see the Principles of Christian Faith shedding over Families Neighbourhoods and Communities the comfortable Influences of Unity and Peace like the  Dew of Hermon and the Dew that descendeth upon the Mountains of Zion where the Lord commandeth the Blessing even Life for evermore  Psal cxxxiii  We would see them inspiring private Faith and publick Loyalty restoring Sobriety of Manners and Simplicity of Life promoting in every Man Contentment with his Lot Resignation  to Divine Appointment continual Regard to the Blessing of HeavenWe may extol  Riches  and  Traffick  but in Truth the Prevalency of such Principles of publick  Virtue  and  Concord  forms the real  Strength  and  Glory  of a Nation In Proportion as these prevail they give us the Prospect of human Society rising from that sad  Degeneracy  into which it is at present sunk and advancing under the Blessing of Heaven towards that happy Period when  Nation shall not lift up their Sword against Nation nor War be learned any more  Isa ii    when there shall be nothing to hurt nor destroy in all the holy Mountain of God  To convince us yet further of the Importance of religious Knowledge to the Welfare of Society there is one Consideration which deserves particular Attention It is this That if  good Seed  be not sown in the Field  Tares  will infallibly arise There is a strong  Propension  in human Nature to Religion A natural Preparation of the Mind for receiving some Impressions of religious Belief In ignorant and uncultivated Minds  Superstition  or  Enthusiasm  never fail to graft themselves upon this Root Into what monstrous Forms  these  have shot forth and what various Mischiefs they have produced in Society is too well known But this is not the  whole  of the Danger For designing Men are seldom wanting to take  Advantage  of popular Weakness and to  improve  a superstitious Biass to their own ambitious and interested  Ends  Hence Superstition in itself a formidable Evil threatens Consequences still more formidable when it is made the  Tool  of Ambition and Interest In this Way  Popery  has become the Means of enslaving the People and exalting the Church to exorbitant Power and like some baneful Planet has shed most malignant Influences both on the civil and religious Interests of Christian Society  As it is the  Ignorance  of true Religion which gives Rise to those Evils this furnishes us with one strong Argument for promoting the Knowledge of it in the World that just and rational Principles of Religion may fill up the  Room  in Mens Minds which Superstition will otherwise usurp and the Enemies of Society will make their Advantage of This brings the Case nearer  to ourselves by suggesting to us the Condition of that Part of our own Country upon which the  Society for propagating Christian Knowledge  have chiefly bestowed their Care A Part of the Country which may be considered as yet  rude  and  uncivilized  where Society has scarcely got beyond its  Infant  State and whither the Influence of Government and Order has very imperfectly reached Where the Inhabitants hitherto accustomed to no Subjection except a slavish Dependence on their Chieftains are inured to Rapine totally negligent of the Arts of Peace and Strangers to cultivated Life Where the grossest  Ignorance  and  Superstition  have remarkably reigned and have nourished as their  proper  Offspring a blind Attachment to some pernicious Notions of Government artfully instilled into their Minds If ever the Aid of religious Knowledge was necessary to establish and assist Society it must be allowed to be necessary here Especially as we know Popish Emissaries have not been wanting among them to sow their  poisonous  Principles and to foment that  disaffected  Spirit the violent Effects of which were felt a few Years ago when we saw them rushing like a Torrent  from their own bleak Mountains to spread Confusion and Terror through a peaceful LandIf so many of our Countrymen have hitherto been not only  useless  but even  dangerous  to the rest of the Society ought not  all  wise and good Men to encourage the Design of propagating among them those Principles of true religious Knowledge which may  reform  them from Barbarity and  unite  them to the rest of the Society Regard to our own Safety and Tranquility might alone recommend this Design tho' no  higher  Motive were applied to The Method that is employed in carrying it on must be allowed to be incontestably proper the Establishment of  Schools  for the religious Education of Youth who must otherwise have been void of all moral Culture and of Course have been the prepared Instruments of Violence and Cruelty The good Designs of the  Legislature  for introducing regular Government Industry and Arts into those Parts of the Country can never be pursued with Success if Endeavours be not  early  used to root out bad Principles both of Religion and Government from their Minds and to plant right ones in their stead The more directly to cooperate  with the Legislature for  civil  Good the  Society  have not confined themselves to the Care of  religious  Education but make it their Endeavour to banish  Idleness  and to instruct Youth in  such Arts  as may qualify them to be useful Members of Civil Society  The Society are authorised by a second Patent obtained from the Crown in the Year to  cause such of the Children as they shall think fit to be instructed and bred up to Husbandry Trades and Manufactures or to such other manual Operations as the Society shall think proper    THESE Considerations directly respect the Good of Society But when we take the Argument that has been treated in its  full  Extent when we consider the Importance of religious Knowledge to the  Improvement  and the  Consolation  of every  Individual  to their  present  Happiness and their Preparation for  future  Glory the Motive for spreading that Knowledge through the World receives a great Addition of Strength Is it not an affecting Thought that there should be so many of our Fellowcreatures nay of our Countrymen destitute of all those Blessings which Man may receive from the Discoveries of the Gospel  Strangers from the Covenant of Promise having no Hope and without  God in the World  Ephes ii  What a melancholy View does it give us of human Nature to think of so many  dark Places of the Earth  that are  full of the Habitations of Cruelty  where either sunk in total Darkness or enslaved to wild Superstition Mankind pass their wretched Days scarcely rais'd a Degree above the  Beasts that perish  It is  noble  and  generous  to engage in a Design for retrieving Mankind from so much Misery for advancing at once their temporal and eternal Interests for bringing so many Souls into the  Way of Life  and acquainting them with Him  whom to know is Life eternal  John xvii  Such a Design calls upon every  Lover of Mankind  for Encouragement and Support As it was undertaken from  pious  and  benevolent  Views by the  Society  erected for this Purpose amongst ourselves so by the  Progress  they have made we have great Reason to believe it has been carried on with  Fidelity  and  Zeal  Vid  the subjoin'd Account of the present State of the Society  Their Concern for the Advancement of Religion has not been confined to our native Country They have sent Missionaries among the Heathen  Indians  in our  American  Colonies not without Success In an Undertaking of this Nature where the Field is so wide and where so much yet remains to be done the charitable Assistance of all is most necessary Those especially who are  rich in this World  have here an Opportunity put into their Hands by Providence of employing to the best Advantage some of that Wealth which they may well spare from the Pomp and Superfluities of Life This will be  laying up in Store for themselves a good Foundation against the Time to come  Tim vi  This will be the Means of making the  Blessings  of those who are now ready to perish  through lack of Knowledge  descend at the last upon their Heads This will be the Ground of joyful and comforting Reflections when all the Pleasures of Life can please  no more  What a Reproach is it to this Age of  Vanity  and  Pleasure  that no Assistance is denied and no Expence is spared to carry on  every  favourite Scheme of Diversion and Amusement and  only  pious and Publickspirited Undertakings are  neglected  and suffered to  languish  I must mention one Consideration more which render these Associations of good Men  to promote Christian Knowledge the  more  important and the  more  deserving of our Assistance at this Day They are not only the Means of extending Christianity  further  than it has already reached but likewise of supporting the Regard for it  at Home  They preserve at least the  Face of Seriousness  amongst us and contribute to recall something of that  Zeal  which has so much decayed This renders them peculiarly  seasonable  now when a Horror at  Superstition  and  Enthusiasm  seems to have made us insensible to the Dangers of  Irreligion  and of  Indifference  about all that is sacred Tho' this  last  is certainly much more the general Characteristick of the present Times than the  former  and threatens that Dissolution of Manners which if it become universal must inevitably carry us with swift Steps to  Ruin  As therefore we have any Regard for the most valuable publick Interests let us withstand the Torrent of Profanity by giving all publick Testimonies of a just Concern for the Knowledge and Principles of our holy Religion Let us both give them all the Countenance we can  at home  and embrace every Occasion Providence gives us of extending their Influence  further  through the  World Thus whilst we act a Part which it is  decent  and  becoming  in Christians to act we shall enjoy the Pleasure of having contributed our Endeavours for bringing about that happy Revolution foretold by ancient Prophecy When in the Stile of Scripture  There shall be one Lord over all the Earth and his Name One  Zech xiv    When his Name shall be great from the rising to the setting Sun  Mal i  when  there shall be nothing to hurt nor destroy in all his holy Mountain  but  Judgment shall dwell in the Wilderness and Righteousness remain in the fruitful Field  Isaiah xxxii    The Desart shall rejoice and blossom as the Rose  Isaiah xxxv  and  The Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord as the Waters cover the Sea  STATE OF THE SOCIETY in  Scotland  FOR Propagating CHRISTIAN KNOWLEDGE in the Year  THIS SOCIETY took its Rise about the Year and in the Year was erected into a Body corporate by Letters patent from her late Majesty Queen  Anne  The Intention was to promote the Knowledge of Christianity thro' the remote Corners of the Highlands of  Scotland  miserably sunk in Darkness and in Ignorance a Design which every one must acknowledge laudable and worthy of Encouragement  THIS Encouragement it met from many pious and welldisposed Persons who from  time to time did and do still contribute towards its Support by charitable Donations in so much that at present the Society finds itself in Condition to maintain no fewer than Schools at which are educated to the Number of Children of both Sexes  THE Directors use the Word  educate  because that comes up best to the Design of the Society which is to instruct the Children first of all in the Knowledge of Christianity the reformed Protestant Religion  dly  In Writing Orthography Arithmetick and Church Musick  dly  In the Knowledge of the  English  Tongue and if possible to root out the  Irish  altogether And  lastly  To teach them right Principles of Government to instil a Love of true Liberty and Affection to King  George  WITH this Design did the Society set out with this Design does it still go on and in this Design it has in some Measure happily succeeded so that from the Beginning of its Erection until now at the most moderate Computation it has been the Means of instructing  Children of both Sexes in the Knowledge of Christianity The first Step to introduce Religion into the Heart is to dispel the Clouds of Ignorance in the HeadThe Society can do no more than Men can do they may endeavour to convey Knowledge into the Head but it is the Office of the supreme Being to bring it home to the Heart  AND sure the Means which this Society uses are of all others the most proper They are applied to the Minds of the Inhabitants when these Minds and these inhabitants are young and their Tempers like the Willow are more easily bent any WayIf they cannot succeed at this Age they never will at any and it is believed that if this Method of reforming the Highlands of  Scotland  proves abortive all other human Methods certainly will  SURE then it cannot but be the Duty and must be the Interest of every good Man of every  Briton  to encourage this Designtending so evidently to make us a happya freeand an united NationReligion and Liberty and Industry and Joy are Sisters and  never appear to such Advantage as in Company with one anotherWhile Superstition and Slavery and Idleness and Sulleness are Spectres the most hideous and ought to have their Dwelling not upon the Earth but under it  THE Society obtained a new Patent in the Year enabling them to instruct the Children under their Care in the Knowledge of Husbandry and Housewifery Trade and Manufacture or in such like manual Operations This they have already done in several remarkable Instances and are desireous to do so in more as their Stock enables them And they apply the Benefactions made either to the Purposes of the first or of the second Charter as the Donor is pleased to direct so that now Religion and Industry go Hand in Hand strengthen and establish one another  AMONG the various Instances of Generosity which the Year has produced the Directors judge themselves bound to take particular Notice of the two following both from one Country that of  Ireland  The one is the Liberality of an  Irish  Gentleman of Distinction who has not only paid into the Society  l  Sterl  towards the Support of Charity Schools in the Islands of  Scotland  but also caused translate Mr  Baxter  's  Call to the Unconverted  c into the  Irish  Language for the Use of such as cannot learn  English  under Direction of this Society and has given a very considerable Sum and engaged to pay what further may be necessary for defraying the Expence of itThe Work is now finished by the Labours of a Reverend Member of the Church of  Scotland  and will be printed without Delay and distributed at the Sight of the Society  THE other is a Legacy which the Society has received from Mr  Hall  Surgeon in  Dublin  for no less than  l Sterl  of which they have now actually got PaymentTwo Instances worthy to be imitated by all where Circumstances will allow who hope for that melting Acknowledgement of the Saviour of Sinners  In as much as ye have done those Things to one of the least of my Brethren ye have done them unto me  BESIDES those Endeavours used by the Society to promote the Knowledge of true Religion at home they have also in Conformity  to a Clause in their first Patent extended their Care to Places abroad particularly to the wild and wandering  Indians  on the Borders of  New York New Jersey  and  Pensilvania  The first Attempt of this Kind was made in the Year and another and more successful one in the Year and Of the Success of this last Mission the World has had a printed Account under the Care of Dr  Doddridge  in Mr  Brainard  's Journal To this the Directors beg Leave to refer after adding the following Extract of the Society's latest Advices from Mr  Pemberton  Preses of the Society of  American  Correspondents  New York  April th  SIR  INCLOSED you have the Journals of the Society's two Missionaries who diligently attend their respective Charges and the most of those whom we charitably hoped were the Subjects of a saving Change continue to adorn their Profession by a Behaviour and exemplary Conversation  MR  Brainard  's  Indians  are daily forming themselves more and more into a civilized  and orderly SocietyThe Men cultivate their Lands the Women are learning to spin and they have in a great Measure abandoned that slothful Course of Life which is so natural to all  Indians  that they are brought off from it with the utmost Difficulty  We have set up a Seminary of Learning in  New Jersey  and if the Society by recommending our Design to pious and charitable Persons could procure us any Assistance it would doubtless be of extensive Service to the Interest of Religion in these Parts  c c c  By the two last Journals which the Society have received from Mr  Brainard  it appears among other Things that many of the  Indians  are grown extremely desirous of reading and understanding the Word of GodFor that End says he they attend an Evening School which the Schoolmaster has set up on PurposeThe greater Part of the young People attend this School also and some that are or Years of Age and it is hoped that most of them will in a little Time be able to read the  Bible The School is increasing and the Children make good Progress in their Learning  As to the College proposed to be erected in  New Jersey  the Society have done every Thing in their Power to encourage it and have set apart the Sum of  l Sterl  to be employed in buying proper Books for the Students so that in a little Time there is reason to hope that there will be no more Reason for a Complaint so often made in these Parts That  the Harvest is great but the Labourers are few  Neither can the Directors omit taking this Opportunity of recommending this good Design to others The Thing indeed recommends itself and must do so to every Person whose Heart is capable of the least Tincture of Compassion for such vast Numbers of poor forlorn  Indians  Nor would such a Seminary answer a religious End only it would also serve a political View for sure if from us Learning and good Manners could be propagated thro' these Savages it would be a Mean of engaging them more firmly in the  British  Interest And if along with Learning and good Manners true Religion should take place among them and they become  come Subjects willing Subjects of the KING of all Kings what Joy would not this yield to every sincere Christian  BY this Means Streams would break out in that vast Wilderness and Rivers run in that immense DesartNay the Desart would rejoice and blossom as the Rose so that from the Rising of the Sun unto where he goeth down a pure Offering should be offered unto the true GodMen should be blessed in Jesus and all Nations call him Blessed  These are the Prayers of this Society and they are the Prayers of every true Christian  Names of Persons appointed to receive BENEFACTIONS in  London  and  Edinburgh  for the Use of this SOCIETY  In  London Claud Johnson  Merchant  In  Edinburgh James
