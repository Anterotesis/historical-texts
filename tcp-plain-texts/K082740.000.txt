 ELEGIES By Mr DELAP  LONDON Printed for R and J DODSLEY in PALLMALL MDCCLX  ELEGIES  ELEGY I  AH staythy wand oblivious o'er my eyes  Yet wave mild power of sleepmy pray'r is vain  She flies the partial nurse of nature flies  With all her soothing visionary train  Then let me forth and near yon flowering thorn  Taste heav'n's pure breath while rob'd in amber vest  Fresh from her watry couch the youthful morn  Steals on the slumbers of the drowzy east  Lo at her presence the strong arm of toil  With glittering sickle mows the prime of may  While yon poor hirelings for the mine's rude soil  Leave to their sleeping babes their cots of clay  With sturdy step they cheerly whistle o'er  The path that flings across the reedy plain  To the deep caverns of that yawning moor  Whose shaggy breast abhors the golden grain  There in her green dress nature never roves  Spreads the gay lawn nor lifts the lordly pine  They see no melting clouds refresh the groves  No living landscape drawn by hands divine  But many a fathom from the sunny breeze  Their painful way in central night they wear  Heave the pik'd axes on their bended knees  Or sidelong the rough quarry slowly tear  Yet while damp vapours chill each reeking brow  How loudly laughs the jovial voice of mirth  Pleas'd that the wages of the day allow  A social blaze to cheer their ev'ning hearth  There the chaste housewife with maternal care  Her thrifty distaf plies in grave attire  Blest to behold her ruddy offspring wear  The full resemblance of their sturdy sire  To spread with such coarse fare their homely board  As fits the genius of their little fate  Free from those ills that haunt their pamper'd lord  To be unhappy we must first be great  In these dark caves where heav'n's paternal hand  Far from the world their private cradle laid  They toil secure the storms that strike the land  With wild dismay roll harmless o'er their head  For who the load of weary life to bear  Wou'd from these murky mansions chace the slave  Who cease to breathe heav'n's pure and chearful air  To be but living tenants of the grave  Yet harrass'd as they are their face still wears  The reverend comeliness of green old age  No stains their mind from worldly science bears  Their ray of knowledge gleams from nature's page  The few plain rules her simple lessons give  They still thro' life with pleas'd attention ply  Their helpless offspring bid them wish to live  Their breathless parents bid them learn to die  And surely heav'n whose penetrating sight  Pierces the soul and reads its inmost groan  Must see content with more sincere delight  Toil in the mine than triumph on the throne  See  Charles V of Spain who in the full blaze of his glory resigned the throne to his son Philip and retired to a convent in Estremadura  Charles more pleas'd within the convent's gloom  Seeking the slaves calm nights their temperate days  And peaceful passage to the private tomb  Than diadem'd with glory's crimson rays  Ev'n the proud sage whose deep mysterious brain  Has reason'd all the balm of hope away  Convinc'd that learning's but ingenious pain  Might hail their happier lot and sighing say  "Oh had I thus within the dark profound  "By daily labor earn'd my daily food  'Or with yon seedsman sow'd the quickening ground  "Or cleav'd with ponderous ax the groaning wood  "Full many an hour that now tho' sped with art  "On slow and dusky pinions sullen flies  "Full many an anxious wish or pang of heart  "That reason's boasted anodyne defies  "Had ne'er been born Nor had th' uneasy mind  "Pent in the prison of this mortal mould  "Felt its ethereal energy confin'd  "Its brightest sunshine in dark clouds enroll'd  "But native sense her modest course had run  "Her saintly lustre untaught virtue spread  "Health crown'd my toils and ere the day was done  "Sound sleep beneath some alder's rustling shade  "Then as I stole down life's declining hill  "Here nature's gifts had furnish'd nature's needs  "The brook's cold beverage ev'ry latent ill  "Had starv'd that cloyster'd contemplation feeds  "Till in the peaceful shade of this lone bower  "Or near yon shattered tower in silence laid  "The orient orb that watch'd my natal hour  "Had brightly glitter'd o'er my mouldering head  TO SICKNESS  ELEGY II  HOW blith the flowery graces of the spring  From nature's wardrobe come and hark how gay  Each glittering insect hovering on the wing  Sings their glad welcome to the fields of may  They gaze with greedy eye each beauty o'er  They suck the sweet breath of the blushing rose  Sport in the gale or sip the rainbow shower  Their life's short day no pause of pleasure knows  Like their's dread Power my chearful morn display'd  The flattering promise of a golden noon  Till each gay cloud that sportive nature spread  Died in the gloom of thy distemper'd frown  Yes ere I told my two and twentieth year  Swift from thy quiver flew the deadly dart  Harmless it past 'mid many a blith compeer  And found its fated entrance near my heart  Pale as I lay beneath thy ebon wand  I saw them rove through pleasure's flowery field  I saw health paint them with her rosy hand  Eager to burst my bonds but forc'd to yield  Yet while this mortal cot of mould'ring clay  Shakes at the stroke of thy tremendous power  Ah must the transient tenant of a day  Bear the rough blast of each tempestuous hour  Say shall the terrors thy pale flag unfolds  Too rigid Queen unnerve the soul's bright powers  Till with a joyless smile the eye beholds  Art's magic charms and nature's fairy bowers  No let me follow still those bowers among  Her flowery footsteps as the goddess goes  Let me just lifted 'bove th' unletter'd throng  Read the few books the learned few compose  And suffer when thy aweful pleasure calls  The soul to share her frail companion's smart  Yet suffer me to taste the balm that falls  From friendship's tongue so sweet upon the heart  Then tho' each trembling nerve confess thy frown  Ev'n till this anxious being shall become  But a brief name upon a little stone  Without one murmur I embrace my doom  For many a virtue shelter'd from mankind  Lives calm with thee and lord o'er each desire  And many a feeble frame whose mighty mind  Each muse has touch'd with her immortal fire  Ev'n  Mr POPE  He sole terror of a venal age  The tuneful bard whose philosophic soul  With such bright radiance glow'd on Virtue's page  Learn'd many a lesson from thy moral school  He  Mr GRAY  too who  "mounts and keeps his distant way"  His daring mind thy humanizing glooms  Have temper'd with a melancholy ray  And taught to warble 'mid the village tombs  Yes goddess to thy temple's deep recess  I come and lay for ever at its door  The siren throng of follies numberless  Nor wish their flattering songs shou'd sooth me more  Thy decent garb shall oer my limbs be spread  Thy hand shall lead me to thy sober train  Who here retir'd with pensive pleasure tread  The silent windings of thy dark domain  Hither the cherub charity shall fly  From her bright orb and brooding o'er my mind  For misery raise a sympathizing sigh  Pardon for foes and love for humankind  Then while ambition's trump from age to age  Its slaughter'd millions boasts while fame shall rear  Her deathless trophies o'er the bard and sage  Be mine the widow's sigh the orphan's prayer  The END
