 Dyers  News Examined as to His  Sweddish  Memorial against the  Review  HAD not the Town been allarm'd with my Name in Print and all my Friends surpris'd with a prospect of something Fatal attending it I had not for a long time appeared in Print again in this part of  Britain  But I can not be so far wanting to the desires of those whom this has amused as to forbear giving the World some Account of it  'Tis sent down it seems in  Dyers  News from  London  that the  Sweddish  Ambassador  Monsieur Liencroon  has delivered in a Memorial to this Court complaining of the  Review  as Reflecting on the King of  Sweden  and demands Satisfaction  First Gentlemen I assure you I know nothing of this my self neither from my Friends in  England  nor from the Government neither do I believe one Word of it I have immediately on Notice of this Written to  England  and desir'd some of my Friends to wait on the Secretaries of State to acquaint them where I am and that if it be required I will on the first Notice take Post for  London  and put my self into their Hands to Answer any thing the Law shall require  In the next place I have Revised what I have Writ of the King of  Sweden  and I profess I can see nothing in it in the least that is or ought to be an Affront to His  Swedish  Majesty  And lastly I thank GOD I Live in a Land where the Liberty of the Subject is such that should all this be true I can receive no Hurt but by Law  The King of  Sweden  indeed has carried it with so high a Hand in some parts of the World that their Princes deliver up their Subjects bound Hand and Foot for him to use his Pleasure with themBut GOD be Praised the Queen of  England  is none of those The Liberty of  English  Men is in a better Case and no Man can be Punished in  England  at the will of the Prince much less at the will of a Forreign Prince  In  England  even the Soveraign can not punish but by Law the Subject must have a fair Tryal and a Jury of his Equals must Determine the Fact If the King of  Sweden  should demand the delivering up the meanest Subject the Queen has even a meaner  if such can be  than the Author of the  Review  Her Majesty would immediately Reply That it is not in Her Power to deliver any of Her Subjects up or to punish them any farther  than as the Law directs And that the meanest and most despicable Subject in  England  may even say to his Soveraign  That he will not be delivered up  Nor do I believe the King of  Sweden  can think he has an Emperor of  Germany  to deal with in the Queen of  GreatBritain  and that he can demand a Count  Zobor  of Her Majesty  I am content to be answerable to the Law if I have offended him or any Body else and it is no Arrogancy to say I am a Subject of the Laws of  England  and of no other Mortal Power in the World  This is to be a Subject to GOD and the Queen for an Obedience to the Law is all the Subjection  speaking of Humane Affairs  that either GOD or the Queen requires  But what is it you said of the King of  Sweden  says the Enquirers you must have said some ill thing of him or else he would not have Complained of your Paper by his Ambassador  Truly Gentlemen I'll tell you as near as I can what I said of himand if I tell it again you will say 'Tis a sign I have not much fear upon me of his Resentment  I said That the  Swede  lying in  Saxony  all this Summer with Men about him and doing nothing while he suffered his new King of  Poland  to be ruin'd and the Countrey to be ravaged by the  Muscovite  signified that he had some secret design in his Head some project on Foot which no Body knew of but himself  I said If he had no Design no Meaning no Prospect and yet lay still there while his Subjects and his Allies were ruined by his Enemies he was the most Impolitick Nothingdoing Prince in the World  I said That for a Prince to neglect the Defence of his own Subjects and leave them Exposed to the Invasion of Cruel and Barbarous Neighbours when he is at the same time pushing on the Conquests and Triumphs of Victory against their Neighbours is all one with a Father who neglects to provide for his Family of whom the Text says he is worse than an Infidel  I said That if the  Swede  should fall on the Emperor and thereby oblige him to quitt the Confederacy  and make a separate Peace with France  we should have but little Cause to thank him for his Care of the Protestant Religion  I said That if the  Swede  should fall upon the Emperor and oblige him to draw all his Troops from  Hungaria Naples Provence  and the  Rhine  he would be beaten and not be able to stand before him  These and such as these is the utmost of the Matter and if the  Swedish  Ambassador has made a Complaint of this I shall always be ready to Answer it  If I had really said any thing which was Unbecoming me of the  King of  Sweden  or any Body else I should be willing to acknowledge it and make Satisfaction But as what I have said are both known and useful Truths with a great deal of Calmness and Satisfaction I say I am ready to Answer him or any Man else as far as the Liberty and Laws of  Britain  require and so much for the King of  Swedens  Ambassador  'Tis a Happy thing Gentlemen to live under the laws of  England  I hope you are advancing apace to the same Liberty you may be assured no  Nation  in  Europe  enjoys the like Privileges and I hope you will all partake of them and learn to value them  No Resentment of Forreign Princes can affect us no Threatnings terrifie us an  English  man is born a free man no Power can insult him no Superior Oppress him The Law only is his Governour no Magistrate no Counsellor no Authority no not the Sovereign has the least illegal Power over him he can have no Sentence pronounced against him no punishment inflicted no Fine levied no not by the Queen Her Self but according to Law  This is the Confidence the Peace and the Glory of this Island and no Forreign Power can interpose in it If the greatest King or Emperor in the World demands of the Queen of  Britain  the delivering up any one of Her Subjects to them they may lawfully refuse to goif the Sovereign puts a Man in Prison by His Royal Authoritythe Man serves the Judge with a Writ of  Habeas Corpus  and he will let him out again even Her Majesty her self  asking Pardon for the Expression  cannot detain him  He that will abandon this Liberty is not a Fool only but a Knave a Knave to himself and to his Family a Knave to his Posterity and a Knave to the Constitution of the Nation for he gives up the Right of a Subject and leaves an Example of wilful Bondage to his Countreymen  If there be any such I have only to say I am sure I am not the Man  Britains  Gentlemen are none of the Tribe of  Issachar  whose Coat of Arms is an Ass couchant what Burden the Law puts upon us we freely submit to and never complain either of the Law or of the Sovereign  But we always Kick at Oppression and Resist Tyrrany and it has hitherto GOD be praised been found in vain to Enslave us  Her Majesty the best Queen that ever Governed us has made it Her Glory to Reign over a Free People the Queen despises Tyrrany as infinitely below Her It's Her Pleasure to see the Laws Triumph 'tis Her Glory to see Justice Uninterrupted and 'tis Her Majesties peculiar Blessing that there are none of Her People complaining of Oppression  Attempts enough have been made to surprise the Government into Tyrrany but both the Attempts and their Authors have found their  Quietus  in Her Majesties Justice and in Her Native Aversion to Cruelty and Arbitrary Power  'Tis from hence with satisfaction any Subject may say and I say it with a secret Joy that I can not express the Innocent Man may fly with Safety to the Law if he has not Offended he is sure he shall not be Opprest if he has he is sure to find Justice always mingled with the Princes Compassion  Let none of my Friends be afraid for me if I have broke the Law they ought to abandon me to the Law and I ask no Favour If I have not no King no Power no Threatning no not all the Powers of  Europe  can make Her Majesty break in upon Her Peoples Liberties or Deviat from Justice in the Satisfaction of which all Her Subjects are easie and safe and I among the rest  As to  Dyer's  Letter he was always Careful that it should not be seen in  London  whether for Shame or Fear is not Material and from thence he often takes the Liberty to Forge Stories that have not the least ground of Truth in them and this is not the first time he has done so by me in particular which Forgeries he spreads in the Countrey and the Letter not being to be had in the City he is not so easily contradicted  I must say however  Dyer  the News Writer ought to have been the last Man in the World to have said this in his Paper since Monsieur  Liencroon  never took notice what he wrote in his publick Paper  viz  that the Duke of  Marlborrow  obtained his desire of the King of  Sweden  by Bribing Count  Piper  ADVERTISEMENT  Preparing for
