Shame universal  v  This passion implanted in man as a Spur to Virtue is generally perverted  v  And thus becomes the occasion of the greatest miseries follies and vices  v  It is the work of Satire to rectify this passion to reduce it to its proper channel and convert it into an incentive to Wisdom and Virtue  v  Hence it appears that Satire may influence those who defy all laws human and divine

in  France v  and Mr  Pope  in  England v c  AN ESSAY ON SATIRE c  FATE gave the word the cruel arrow sped  And POPE lies number'd with the mighty dead  Exulting Dulness ey'd the setting light  And flapp'd her wing impatient for the night  Guilt at the signal rowzing all her train  Broods o'er the glories of her growing reign  Th' envenom'd monsters spit their deadly foam  To blast the laurel that surrounds his tomb  With inextinguishable rage they burn  And snakehung Envy hisses o'er his urn  But thou whose eye from passion's film refin'd  Can see true greatness in an honest mind  Can see each virtue and each grace unite  And taste the raptures of a PURE delight  O visit oft his awful page with care  And view the bright assemblage treasur'd there  Yet deign to hear the efforts of a muse  Whose eye not wing his ardent flight pursues  Intent from this great archetype to draw  Or faintly shadow SATIRE's pow'r and law  Pleas'd if from hence th' unlearn'd may comprehend  And rev'rence HIS and SATIRE's generous end  In ev'ry breast there burns an active flame  The love of glory or the dread of shame  The passion ONE tho' diff'rent forms it wear  As brighten'd into hope or sunk by fear  The lisping infant and the hoary sire  And youth and manhood feel the heartborn fire  The charms of praise the coy the modest wooe  And fly from glory that she may pursue  As Galatea  Galatea lasciva Puella  Fugit ad Salices sed se cupit ante videri  VIRG  playful on the green  Hides in the grove yet wishes to be seen  She pow'rful goddess rules the wise and great  Bends ev'n reluctant hermits at her feet  Haunts the proud city and the lowly shade  And sways alike the scepter and the spade  Heav'n thus in man it's friendly pow'r displays  To urge him on to deeds that merit praise  But man vain man to folly only wife  Rejects the Manna sent him from the skies  With rapture hears corrupted passion's call  Still proudly prone to mingle with the stall  As each deceitful shadow tempts his view  He for imagin'd substance quits the true  Eager to catch the visionary prize  In quest of glory plunges deep in vice  Till madly zealous impotently vain  He forfeits ev'ry praise he pants to gain  Thus still imperious nature plies her part  And still her dictates work in ev'ry heart  Each pow'r that sovereign nature bids enjoy  Man may corrupt but man can ne'er destroy  Like mighty rivers with resistless force  The passions rage obstructed in their course  Swell to new heights forbidden paths explore  And drown those virtues which they fed before  And sure the deadliest foe to virtue's flame  Our worst of evils is  perverted shame    Beneath this yoke what abject numbers groan  The shackled slaves to folly not their own  Blind to ourselves by sordid fear oppress'd  We seek our Virtues in each other's breast  Meanly adopt another's wild caprice  Another's weakness or another's vice  Each tool to hoodwink'd pride so poorly great  That pines in splendid wretchedness of state  Tir'd in ambition's chase would nobly yield  And but for shame like Sylla quit the field  The daemon  Shame  paints strong the ridicule  And whispers close "  the world will call you fool  "  Behold yon wretch to impious madness driv'n  Believes and trembles while he scoffs at heav'n  By weakness strong and bold thro' fear alone  He dreads the sneer by shallow coxcombs thrown  Dauntless pursues the path Spinoza trod  To man a coward a bravoe to GOD  Voistu ce Libertin en public intrepide  Qui preche contre un Dieu que dans son ame il croit  Il iroit embrasser la verit√© qu'il voit  Mais de ses faux amis il craint la raillerie  Et ne brave ainsi Dieu que par poltronnerie  BOIL Ep    Truth justice heav'n in vain shall claim their pow'r  If the heart court fantastick honour more  Thus virtue sinks beneath unnumber'd woes  When passions born her friends revolt her foes  Hence SATIRE's pow'r 'Tis her instructive part  To calm the wild disorders of the heart  She points the arduous height where glory lies  And teaches mad ambition to be wise  From foul example kindles fair desire  Draws good from ill from flint elicits fire  Like the nice BEE with art most subtly true  From poys'nous vice extracts a healing dew  Parody on these lines of Mr POPE  In the nice  BEE  what art so subtly true  From poys'nous herbs extracts a healing dew    Strips black oppression of her gay disguise  And bids the hag in native horror rise  Strikes bloated pride and lawless rapine dead  And plants the wreath of fame on virtue's head  Nor boasts the muse imaginary pow'r  Tho' oft' she mourn those ills she cannot cure  The worthy court her and the worthless fear  Who hate her piercing eye that eye revere  Her awful voice the vain and vile obey  And ev'ry foe to wisdom feels her sway  Smarts pedants as she smiles no more grow vain  Desponding fops resign the clouded cane  Hush'd at her voice pert folly's self is still  And dulness wonders while she drops her quill  Her  hand from vice fair virtues oft hath sprung  As the skill'd planter raises flow'rs from dung  Weak are the ties which publick art can find  To quell the madness of the tainted mind  Cunning evades securely wrapt in wiles  And force strongsinew'd rends th'unequal toils  The stream of vice impetuous drives along  Too deep for policy for pow'r too strong  Ev'n fair religion native of the skies  Scorn'd by the fool seeks refuge with the wise  But SATIRE's arrow searches ev'ry breast  She plays a  ruling  passion on the rest  Fast binds the slave that earth and heav'n defy'd  And awes him from the battery of his pride  When fell corruption by her vassals crown'd  Derides fall'n justice prostrate on the ground  Swift to redress an injur'd people's groan  Bold SATIRE shakes the tyrant on her throne  Pow'rful as death defies the sordid train  And slaves and sycophants surround in vain  But with the friends of vice the foes of SATIRE  All truth is spleen all spirit is illnature  Well may they dread the Muse's fatal skill  Well may they tremble when she draws her quill  Her magick quill that like Ithuriel's spear  Displays the cloven hoof or lengthen'd ear  Bids vice and folly take unborrow'd shapes  Turns Duchesses to  Not  these  into Duchesses which is but a modern art  strumpets beaux to apes  Drags the vile whisperer from his dark abode  Till all the daemon starts up from the toad  O sordid maxim form'd to screen the vile  That true goodnature still must wear a smile  In frowns involv'd her beauties stronger rise  When love of virtue wakes her scorn of vice  Where justice calls 'tis cruelty to save  And 'tis the law's goodnature hangs the knave  Who combats virtue's foe is virtue's friend  Then judge of SATIRE's merit by her end  To guilt alone her vengeance stands confin'd  The object of her love is all mankind  They least are pain'd who merit Satire most  Folly the Laureat's vice was Chartres' boast  And sure 'tis just to gibbet high the name  Of fools and knaves already dead to shame  Oft' SATIRE acts the faithful surgeon's part  Generous and kind tho' painful is her art  Her optics all the dark disease explore  Her weapon launces wide the gangreen'd sore  Deep wounds hypocrisy's fairseeming skin  Where death in ulcerous humours lurks within  With caution bold she only strikes to heal  Tho' folly burns to break the friendly steel  Then sure no guilt impartial SATIRE knows  Kind even in vengeance kind to virtue's foes  Whose is the crime the scandal too be their's  The knave and fool are their own libellers    Dare nobly then  But conscious of your trust  As ever warm and bold be ever just  Nor court applause in these degenerate days  The hate of villains is extorted praise  O'er all be steady in a noble end  And shew mankind that truth has yet a friend  'Tis mean for empty praise of wit to write  As Foplings laugh to show their teeth are white  To lash a doubtful folly with a smile  Or madly blaze unknown defects is vile  'Tis doubly vile when but to prove your art  You fix an arrow in a blameless heart  O lost to honour's call O doom'd to shame  Thou fiend accurs'd thou murderer of fame  Fell ravisher from innocence to tear  That name than life than freedom held more dear  To breathe contagion o'er the springing flow'r  Procrustes like in wantonness of pow'r  To torture truth and virtue till they fit  And die in pangs upon the rack of wit  Where shall thy baseness meet it's just return  Or what repay thy guilt but endless scorn  And know immortal truth shall mock thy toil  Immortal truth shall bid the shaft recoil  With rage redoubled wing the deadly dart  And steep it's load of poison in thy heart  Let SATIRE next her proper limits know  And e'er she strike  be sure  she strikes a foe  Nor fondly deem you spy a real fool  At each gay impulse of blind  ridicule    Before whose altar virtue oft' hath bled  And oft' a fated victim shall be led  Lo  It were to be wished that Lord  Shaftsbury  had expressed himself with greater precision on this subject However thus much may be affirmed with truth  st By the general tenour of his Essays on  Enthusiasm  and the  Freedom of Wit and Humour  it appears that his principal design was to recommend the  Way of Ridicule  as he calls it for the  Investigation  of Truth and  Detection  of Falshood not only in  moral  but  religious  subjects  dly It appears no less evident that in the course of his reasonings on this question he confounds two things which are in their nature and consequences entirely different These are  Ridicule  and  GoodHumour  the  latter  acknowledged by all to be the best  Mediator  in every debate the  former  no less regarded by most as an  Embroiler  and  Incendiary  Tho' he sets out with a formal profession of proving the efficacy of Wit Humour and Ridicule in the investigation of Truth yet by shifting and mixing his terms he generally slides insensibly into mere encomiums on GoodBreeding Chearfulness Urbanity and free Enquiry This indeed keeps something like an argument on foot and amuses the superficial reader but to a more observant eye discovers a very contemptible defect either of sincerity or penetration  The question concerning Ridicule may be thus not improperly stated Whether  doubtful  Propositions of any kind can be  ascertained  by the application of  Ridicule  Much might be said on this question but a few words will make the matter clear to an unprejudiced mind  The Disapprobation or Contempt which certain objects raise in the mind of man is a particular mode of Passion the objects of this passion are  apparent  Falshood Incongruity or Impropriety of some particular kinds Thus the object of Fear is  apparent  Danger or probable approaching Ill But who has ever dreamt of exalting the passion of  Fear  into a  Standard  or  Test  of  real Danger  The design must have been rejected as absurd because it is the work of Reason  only  to correct and fix the passion on its proper objects The case is parallel  apparent  or  seeming  Falshoods  c  are the objects of Contempt but it is the work of Reason  only  to determine whether the  supposed  Falshoods be  real  or  fictitious  But it is said  "The  Sense of Ridicule  can never be mistaken"  Why no more can the  Sense of Danger    "What do men never  fear  without reason"  Yes very commonly but they as often  despise  and  laugh  without reason And thus before any thing can be determined in either case Reason and Reason only must examine Circumstances separate Ideas decide upon restrain and correct the Passion  Hence it follows that the  way of Ridicule  is in fact no more than a  species of Eloquence  It applies to a Passion and therefore can go no farther in the investigation of Truth than any of those arts which tend to raise Love Pity Terror Rage or Hatred in the heart of man Consequently his Lordship might have transplanted the  whole System of Rhetorick  into his new scheme with the same propriety as he hath introduced the  way of Ridicule  itself A hopeful project this for the propagation of Truth  As this seems to be the real nature and tendency of Ridicule it hath been generally discouraged by  Philosophers  and  Divines  together with every other mode of eloquence when apply'd to  controverted Opinions  This discouragement from what is said above appears to have been rational and just therefore the charge laid against  Divines  with regard to this affair by a zealous admirer of Lord  Shaftsbury  See a note on the  Pleasures of Imagination  Book III seems entirely groundless The distinction which the same author hath attempted with respect to the influence of Ridicule between  speculative  and  moral Truths  seems no better founded It is certain that  Opinions  are no less liable to Ridicule than  Actions  And it is no less certain that the way of Ridicule cannot  determine  the Propriety or Impropriety of the  one  more than the Truth or Falshood of the  other  because the same passion of Contempt is equally engaged in both cases and therefore as above Reason  only  can examine the circumstances of the  Action  or  Opinion  and thus six the Passion on its  proper  Objects  Upon the whole this new design of  discovering Truth  by the  vague  and  unsteady Light of Ridicule  puts one in mind of the honest  Irishman  who apply'd his  Candle  to the  SunDial  in order to see how the Night went  Shaftsb'ry rears her high on reason's throne  And loads the slave with honours not her own  Bigswoln with folly as her smiles provoke  Profaneness spawns pert dulness drops a joke  Say shall we join a while this gaping crew  And prove at least the ideot  may  be true  Deride our weak forefathers' musty rule  Who  therefore  smil'd  because  they saw a fool  Sublimer logick now adorns our isle  We  therefore  see a fool  because  we smile  Truth in her gloomy cave why fondly seek  Lo gay she sits in laughter's dimpled cheek  Contemns each surly academick foe  And courts the spruce freethinker and the beau  Daedalian arguments but few can trace  But all can screw the muscles of their face  Hence mighty Ridicule's allconqu'ring hand  Shall work Herculean wonders thro' the land  Bound in the magick of her cobweb chain  Great WARBURTON shall rage but rage in vain  Truth's sacred prize the loudest horselaugh win  And coxcombs vanquish BERKLEY by a grin  But you more wise reject th' inverted rule  That truth is e'er explor'd by ridicule  On truth on falsehood let her colours fall  She throws a dazzling glare alike on all  Beware the mad advent'rer Bold and blind  She hoists her sail and drives with ev'ry wind  Deaf as the storm to sinking virtue's groan  Nor heeds a friend's destruction or her own  Let clearey'd reason at the helm preside  Bear to the wind or stem the furious tide  Then mirth may urge when reason can explore  This point the way that waft us to the shore  Tho' distant times be sketch'd in SATIRE's page  Yet chief 'tis her's to draw the  present age  With wisdom's lustre folly's shade contrast  And judge the reigning manners by the past  Bid Britain's Heroes awful shades arise  And ancient honour beam on modern vice  Point back to minds ingenuous actions fair  Till the sons blush at what their fathers were  E'er yet 'twas beggary the great to trust  E'er yet 'twas quite a scandal to be just  When vulgar sharpers only dar'd a lye  Or falsify'd the card or cogg'd the dye  E'er lewdness the stain'd garb of honour wore  Or chastity was carted for the whore  Vice strutted in the plumes of freedom dress'd  Or publick spirit was the publick jest  E'er yet indignant SATIRE's honest page  Was fir'd to vengeance by an iron age  The parent and the nurse of ev'ry crime  The dregs the drainings of exhausted time  Be ever in a just expression bold  Yet ne'er degrade fair SATIRE to a scold  Let no unworthy rage her form debase  But let her smile and let her frown with grace  In mirth be temperate decent in her spleen  Nor while she preaches modesty obscene  Deep let her wound not rankle to a sore  Nor call his lordship her grace a  The muse's charms with surest force assail  When wrapt in Irony's transparent veil  Her beauties halfconceal'd the more surprize  And keener lustre sparkles in her eyes  Then be your line with sharp encomiums grac'd  Stile Clodius honourable Bufa chaste  For memoirs Ayre the glory of the nation  Cibber for ode and Gordon for translation  Of TACITUS    Dart not on Folly an indignant eye  Who e'er discharg'd artillery on a fly  Laugh not at vice absurd the thought and vain  To bind the tiger in so weak a chain  Nay more when flagrant crimes your laughter move  The knave exults to smile is to approve  The muse's labour then success shall crown  When Folly feels her smile and Vice her frown  Know next what measures to each theme belong  And suit your thoughts and numbers to your song  On wings proportion'd to your quarry rise  And stoop to earth or soar among the skies  Thus when prevailing folly claims a smile  Free the expression humble be the stile  In strains adapted sing the midnight toil  Of Camps and Ss disciplin'd by Hoyle  In artless numbers paint th' ambitious Pr  That mounts the box and shines a charioteer  For glory warm the leathern belt puts on  And smacks the whip with art and rivals John  Or  him  whose moderate ambition reaches  But to his hip a connoisseur in breeches  Proud with his sheers to clip his way to fame  And grope for glory while he covers shame  Let SATIRE here in milder beauty shine  And gayly graceful sport along the line  Bid awkard folly quit her thin pretence  And smile each affectation into sense  Not so when Virtue by her guards betray'd  Spurn'd from her throne implores the muse's aid  When  crimes  which erst in kindred darkness lay  Rise frontless and insult the eye of day  When weeping Hymen veils his hallow'd fires  And whiterob'd Chastity with sighs retires  And rank Adultery on the marriage bed  Hot from Cocytus rears her crimson head  When private Faith and publick Trust are sold  And traitors barter Liberty for gold  When fell Corruption dark and deep as fate  Saps the foundation of a tottering state  When GiantVice and Irreligion rise  On mountain'd falsehoods to invade the skies  Then warmer numbers glow thro' SATIRE's page  And all her smiles are darken'd into rage  On eagle wing she gains Parnassus' height  Not lofty Epic soars a nobler flight  The conscious mountain trembles at her nod  And ev'ry awful gesture speaks the God  Then keener indignation fires her eye  Then flash her light'nings and her thunders fly  Wide and more wide the flaming bolts are hurl'd  Till all her wrath involves the guilty world  Yet SATIRE oft' assumes a gentler mein  And beams on virtue's friends a smile serene  Reluctant wounds but pours her balm with joy  Pleas'd to commend where merit strikes her eye  But tread with caution this enchanted ground  Inclos'd by faithless precipices round  Truth be your guide disdain ambition's call  And if you fall with Truth you greatly fall  'Tis virtue's  native Lustre  that must  shine  The poet can but  set  it in his line  And who unmov'd with laughter can behold  A  dirty Pebble  meanly grac'd with gold  Let real merit then adorn your lays  For shame attends on prostituted praise  And all your wit your most distinguish'd art  Can only prove you want an honest heart  Nor think the Muse by SATIRE's law confin'd  She yields description of the noblest kind  Great  is the toil the latent soul to trace  To paint the heart and catch internal grace  By turns bid vice and virtue strike our eyes  Now bid a WOLSEY or SEJANUS rise  Now with a touch more sacred and refin'd  Call forth a BRUTUS' or a SCIPIO's mind  Here sweet or strong may ev'ry colour flow  Here let the pencil warm the canvass glow  Of light and shade provoke the noble strife  And wake the swelling figures into life  Thro' ages thus hath SATIRE greatly shin'd  The friend to truth to virtue and mankind  Yet the fair plant from virtue ne'er had sprung  And man was guilty e'er the Poet sung  With joy the Muse beheld each better age  Till glowing crimes had wak'd her into rage  Truth saw her honest spleen with just delight  And bad her wing her shafts and urge their flight  First on the sons of Greece she prov'd her art  And Sparta felt the fierce IAMBICK Dart  Archilocum proprio rabies armavit Iambo  HOR    To Latium next avenging SATIRE flew  The flaming faulcion bold LUCILIUS

caught the generous fire  For SATIRE's bow resign'd the sounding lyre  Each arrow polish'd in his hand was seen  And as it grew more polish'd grew more keen  He cloath'd his art in study'd negligence  Politely sly cajol'd the foes of sense  Seem'd but to sport and trifle with the dart  But while he sported stab'd them to the heart  In graver strains majestick PERSIUS wrote  Big with a ripe exuberance of thought  Greatly sedate contemn'd a tyrant's reign  And lash'd corruption with a calm disdain  Yet far from vulgar eyes remov'd his seat  Vast chains of rocks inclose the green retreat  Let BOND conduct you thro' the dark profound  And fair poetick scenes shall open round  More ardent eloquence and boundless rage  Devour in JUVENAL's exalted page  His mighty numbers aw'd corrupted  Rome    And swept audacious greatness to it's doom  As headlong torrents thund'ring from on high  Rend the proud rock that lately brav'd the sky  But lo the fatal victor of mankind  Swoln  Luxury  and  Ruin  stalks behind  As countless insects from the Northeast pour  To blast the spring and ravage ev'ry flow'r  So barb'rous millions spread contagious death  The sick'ning laurel wither'd at their breath  Deep Superstition's night the skies o'erhung  Beneath whose baleful dews the poppy sprung  No longer Genius woo'd the Nine to love  But dulness nodded in the Muse's grove  Wit spirit freedom were the sole offence  Nor aught was held ridiculous but sense  At length again fair Science shot her ray  Dawn'd in the skies and spoke returning day  Now SATIRE triumph o'er thy flying foe  Whet whet thy arrows and resume thy bow  See great ERASMUS breaks the pow'rful spell  And wounds triumphant folly in her cell  In vain the solemn cowl surrounds her face  Vain all her bigot cant her sow'r grimace  With shame compell'd her giddy throne to quit  And own the force of reason urg'd by wit  'Twas then plain DONNE in honest vengeance 'rose  His wit refulgent tho' his rhyme were prose  He 'midst an age of puns and pedants wrote  With genuine sense and Roman strength of thought  Yet scarce had SATIRE well relum'd her flame  With grief the muse relates her country's shame  E'er Britain saw the foul revolt commence  And treacherous Wit began her war with Sense  Then 'rose a shameless mercenary crew  Whom latest time with just contempt shall view  A race fantastick in whose page you

dream  When active hunger urg'd her lawless pow'r  Or the stern bailiff thunder'd at the door  But lo again the  Splendid Shilling  shines  And the bard grows immoral as he dines  Proud for a jest obscene a patron's nod  To martyr virtue or blaspheme his God  Unhappy DRYDEN who unmov'd can see  Th' extremes of wit and meanness joyn'd in thee  Flames that could mount and gain their kindred skies  Lowcreeping in the putrid sink of vice  A muse whom truth and wisdom woo'd in vain  The pimp of pow'r the prostitute to gain  Wreaths that shou'd deck fair Virtue's form alone  To strumpets traitors tyrants vilely thrown  Unrival'd parts the scorn of honest fame  And genius rise a monument of shame  More happy France immortal BOILEAU there  Protected wisdom with a father's care  Him with her love propitious SATIRE bless'd  And breath'd her airs divine into his breast  To form his line perfection's laws conspire  And faultless judgment guides unbounded fire  Whether he smiles at folly's fond caprice  Or pours the thunder of his rage on vice  But see at length relenting SATIRE smile  And show'r her choicest boon on BRITAIN's isle  Behold for POPE she twines the laurel crown  And leads the bard triumphant to his throne  Despairing guilt and dulness loath the sight  As goblins vanish at approaching light  The gentle Thames that pours his urn fast by  Surveys the structure with revering eye  To a clear mirror smooths his glassy tide  Proud to reflect a nation's justest pride  But oh what thoughts what numbers shall I find  But faintly to express the Poet's mind  Who yonder star's effulgence can display  Unless he dip his pencil in the ray  Who paint a God unless the God inspire  What catch the lightning but the speed of fire  So mighty POPE to make thy genius known  All pow'r is weak all numbersbut thy own  For thee each Muse with kind contention strove  For thee the Graces left th'Idalian grove  With watchful fondness o'er thy cradle hung  Attun'd thy voice and form'd thy infant tongue  Next to her bard majestick Wisdom came  The bard enraptur'd caught the vigorous flame  With taste superior scorn'd the venal tribe  Whom fear can sway or guilty greatness bribe  At fancy's call who rear the wanton sail  Sport with the stream and trifle in the gale  Sublimer views  thy  daring spirit bound  Thy  mighty voyage was Creation's round  Intent new worlds of science to explore  And bless mankind with wisdom's sacred store  A nobler joy than wit can give impart  And pour a moral transport o'er the heart  Fantastick wit shoots momentary fires  And like a meteor while we gaze expires  Wit kindled by the sulph'rous breath of vice  Like the blue light'ning while it shines destroys  But genius fir'd by truth's eternal ray  Burns clear and constant like the source of day  Like this it's beam prolifick and refin'd  Feeds warms inspirits and exalts the mind  Mildly dispells each wintry passion's gloom  And opens all the virtues into bloom  This praise immortal POPE to thee be giv'n  Thy genius was indeed a gift from heav'n  Hail bard unequal'd in whose deathless line  Reason and wit with strength collected shine  Where matchless wit but wins the second praise  Lost nobly lost in Truth's superior blaze  Did friendship e'er mislead his wandering muse  O let that friendship plead the  great  excuse  That sacred friendship which inspir'd his song  Fair  in defect and  amiably  wrong  Ye deathless names ye sons of endless praise  By virtue crown'd with neverfading bays  Say shall an artless muse if you inspire  Light her pale lamp at your immortal fire  Shou'd she attempt O may she faultless claim  A small a temporary wreath of fame  If such her fate do thou fair  Truth  descend  And watchful guard her in an honest end  Kindly severe instruct her equal line  To court no friend nor own a foe but  thine    But if her giddy eye shou'd vainly quit  Thy sacred paths to run the maze of Wit  If her apostate heart shou'd e'er incline  To offer incense at Corruption's shrine  Urge urge thy pow'r the black attempt confound  And dash the smoaking censer to the ground  Till aw'd to fear instructed bards may see  That guilt is doom'd to sink in infamy
