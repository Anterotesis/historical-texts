 BRITISH ZOOLOGY  ILLUSTRATED BY PLATES AND BRIEF EXPLANATIONS  LONDON Printed And Sold by B WHITE in FLEETSTREET  MDCCLXX  TO WILLIAM CONSTABLE  Esq  OF  BURTONCONSTABLE  DEAR SIR  AS you have quitted your philosophic retirement give me leave to wish every felicity may attend you and that you may soon be enabled to resume those beloved Studies and all the agreeable amusements of which you have so fully learnt the true enjoyment May the tour thro' the different parts of EUROPE you propose visiting be prosperous and entertaining and to ensure that may your primary object the reestablishment of your health meet with the most perfect success May you return with the same inclinations you set out with with that munificent disposition and that benignity which a retreat from the world instead of impairing as is too often the case has exalted and improved  To the last it is possibly owing that you have entertained such a favourable opinion of my labors in a science we are both so enamoured of to you therefore I address this little supplementary work it may perhaps overtake you on the road and if it does not afford you a transient amusement will at lest give you a proof that absent or present at home or abroad I remain unalterably and with the truest esteem  Dear Sir  Your affectionate friend And obedient humble Servant  Thomas Pennant  Downing  Jan  ADVERTISEMENT  THIS publication is intended to illustrate the  Zoology  of  Great Britain  and particularly to supply the deficiency of plates in the three first volumes and to correct any errors that may have crept into them Every defect of that nature which can be discovered and introduced with propriety into this work will be fairly confessed it being far from the editor's design to conceal any mistakes which thro' his own fallibility thro' misinformation of others or too great confidence in preceding writers have found a place in the arduous task he has undertaken  The few subjects engraved in this volume which have been before inserted in the folio edition are such only as have been ill expressed in the great book or are intended to exhibit some very different variety or in a few instances meerly to fill the plate a very few must be excepted which are repeated in order to give here a series of birds of every  British  genus and this will apologize for regraving the  Cuckoo Wryneck  and a few others there being only a single species of each in these islands as a representative of those  genera  I FALCON GENTIL  EXPLANATION  PLATE I FALCON GENTIL  Falco gentilis F cera pedibusque flavis

SWALLOW  Br Zool  II sp I  App    TO strengthen the two opinions in regard to the disappearance of these birds a few other evidences in support of each are added to those before given  My ingenious correspondent the Rev Mr  White  Of  Selborn  near  Alton Hants  on  Michaelmas  day had the good fortune to have ocular proof of what may reasonably be supposed and actual migration of swallows Travelling that morning very early between his house and the coast at the beginning of his journey he was environed with a thick fog but on a large wild heath the mist began to break and discovered to him numberless swallows clustered on the stunted bushes as if they had roosted there as soon as the sun burst out they were instantly on wing and with  IX SWALLOW  SWIFT  an easy and placid flight proceeded towards the sea After this he saw no more flocks only now and then a straggler  In  Kalm  's voyage to  America  is a remarkable instance of the distant flight of swallows for one lighted on the ship he was in  September  when he had passed over only two thirds of the  Atlantic  ocean His passage was uncommonly quick being performed from  Deal  to  Philadelphia  in less than six weeks and when this accident happened he was fourteen days sail from  Cape Hinlopen    This rendezvous of swallows about the same time of year is very common on the willows in the little isles in the  Thames  They seem to assemble for the same purpose as those in  Hampshire  notwithstanding no one has yet been witness of their departure On the th of  September  last two gentlemen who happened to lie at  Maidenheadbridge  furnished at lest a proof of the multitudes there assembled they went by torchlight to an adjacent isle and in less than half an hour brought ashore dozen for they had nothing more to do than to draw the willow twigs thro' their hands the birds never stirring till they were taken  The northern naturalists will perhaps say that this assembly met for the purpose of plunging into their subaqueous winter quarters but was that the case they would never escape discovery in a river so perpetually fished as the  Thames  some of them must  inevitably be brought up in the nets that harass that water  Other witnesses crowd on us to prove the residence of those birds in a torpid state during the severe season First In the chalky cliffs of  Sussex  as was seen on the fall of a great fragment some winters ago  Secondly In a decayed hollow tree that was cut down near  Dolgelli  in  Merionethshire  Thirdly In a cliff near  Whitby Yorkshire  where on digging out a fox whole bushels of swallows were found in a torpid condition  These are doubtless the lurking places of the latter habitations of those young birds who are incapable of distant migrations There they continue insensible and rigid but like flies may sometimes be reanimated by an unseasonable hot day in the midst of winter for very near  Christmas  a few appeared on the moulding of a window of  Merton College Oxford  in a remarkable warm nook which prematurely set their blood in motion having the same effect as laying them before the fire at the same time of year  SWIFT  Br Zool  I sp iv  THE fabulous history of the  Manucodiata  or bird of  Paradise  is here in a great measure verified It was believed to have no feet to live upon coelestial dew to float perpetually on the  Indian  air and to perform all its functions in that element  The Swift actually performs what has been in these enlightened times disproved of the former except the small time it takes for sleeping and what it devotes to incubation every other action is done on wing The materials of its nest it collects either as they are carried about by the winds or picks them from the surface in its sweeping flight Its food is undeniably the insect tribe its drink the dew even its amorous rites are performed on high Few persons who have attended to them in a fine summer's morning but must have seen them making their aerial courses at a vast height encircling a certain space with an easy steady motion On a sudden they fall into each others embraces then drop precipitate with a loud shriek for numbers of yards This is the critical conjuncture and no more to  be wondered at than that insects a familiar instance should discharge the same duty in the same element  X  SEDGE BIRD  Lesser reed sparrow  Wil orn

hard weather on the  Cheviot  hills and in the  Highlands  of  Scotland  in amazing flocks a few  breed on the summits of the highest mountains in the same places with the  Ptarmigans  but the greatest numbers migrate from the north they appear first  Bishop Pocock  's  journal  M S the stages or resting places of these birds in their passage to  Scotland  are probably these  Greenland Iceland Faroe Shetland Orknies Caithness  in the  Orkney  isles and multitudes of them often fall wearied with their flight on vessels in the  Pentland Firth  Their appearance is a certain forerunner of hard weather and storms of snow being driven by the cold from their summer retreats  Spitzbergen Greenland Hudson's  bay and the  Lapland  alps into less rigorous climates they visit at that season all parts of the northern hemisphere  Sweden Prussia Austria Siberia  Bell  's  travels  I  Kramer Aust  the last says they are taken and fed with millet and like the  Ortolan  grow exceffively fat  they arrive lean and return fat in their flights keep very close to each other mingle most confusedly together and fling themselves collectively into the form of a ball at which instant the fowler makes great havock among them  I had opportunity of examining several in  North Britain  some were of the colors of that described p others were black and white  vide  p paragraph I am not certain but suspect the former to be young  but possibly they may vary according to the season as is common with arctic birds  The weight of one I call an old bird was oz onefourth the bill and legs black the

those vast mountains not distant from  Invercauld  the seat of Mr  Farquharson  whose hospitality I experienced in my late tour and under whose conduct I saw with the greatest pleasure the august scenery which that secluded part of the world affords  Invercauld  lies in a fertile vale thro' which flows the  Dee  a large and rapid river nothing can be more beautiful than the different views from the several parts of it on the northern entrance immense ragged and broken crags bound one side of the prospect over whose grey sides and summits is scattered the melancholy green of the picturesque pine which grows out of the naked rock where one would think that nature had denied vegetation  A little lower down is the castle of  Braemar  formerly a necessary curb on the discontented chieftains for this country was once the property of the family of  Mar  but now happily serves for little more than to adorn the landscape  The views from the skirts of the plain near  Invercauld  are very great the hills that immediately bound it are cloathed with trees particularly with birch whose long and pendent branches waving a vast height above the head surpass the beauties of our weeping willow  The southern extremity is particularly magnificent the mountains form there a vast theatre the bosom of which is covered with extensive forests of pines above the trees grow scarcer and scarcer and then seem only to sprinkle the surface after which vegetation ceases and naked summits of a surprizing height succeed many of them topped with perpetual snow and as a fine contrast to the scene the great cataract of  Garval bourn  which seems at a distance to divide the whole foams amidst the dark forest rushing from rock to rock for a vast distance    YELLOW HAMMER  Br Zool  II sp

highest of the  Highland  mountains amidst the rocks perching on the grey stones the general color of the strata in those lofty situations they seldom take long flights but fly about like pigeons are very silly birds and so tame as to suffer a stone to be flung at them without rising It is scarce necessary to have a dog to find them They taste so like a grous as to be scarce distinguishable They

Zool  II sp iii  RUFFS lose their long feathers in moulting season nor do they recover them till spring At the same time the pimples break out about the bill and the older the birds the larger and more numerous are these marks and the longer the neck feathers  Soon after their arrival in the fens in spring they begin to  hill  i e to collect on some dry bank near a flash of water in expectation of the Reeves which resort to them each male keeps possession of a small piece of ground which he continues running round till he has formed a naked circle on the spot If a female lights the Ruffs immediately fall to fighting  When a fowler discovers one of these  hills  he places his net over night which is of the same kind with those called day or clap nets only it is generally single and about fourteen yards long and four broad The fowler resorts to his stand before daybreak  XV REEVE  RUFF  XVI PURR  SANDPIPER  at the distance of one two three or four hundred yards from the nets according to the season for the later it is the shyer are the birds He then makes his first pull taking as many as have happened to light within reach during the night After that he places his stales or stuft birds to entice those that are continually traversing the fens An old fowler told me that he once caught fortyfour birds at the first hawl and in all six dozen that morning When the stales are set seldom more than two or three are taken at a time  There is a great difference between the weight of a Ruff and Reeve the first being oz ½ the last only oz Besides the fens they visit annually

herringfishery on  Lough Fine  an arm of the sea which from its narrowness and the winding of its shore has all the beauties of a fresh water lake  Every evening several hundreds of boats in a manner cover the surface on the week days the chearful noise of the bagpipe and dance ecchoes from on board on the sabbath each boat approaches the land and psalmody and devotion divide the day for the common people of the north are disposed to be religious having the example before them of a gentry untainted by luxury and dissipation and being instructed by a clergy who are active in their duty and who preserve respect amidst all the disadvantages of a narrow income  Each morning the capture of the night is brought on shore the herring is too common a fish to attract the attention of a stranger but the size and form of the tunny is what immediately catches his eye  This fish is the follower of the herring on which it preys and often during night strikes into the nets and does considerable damage When the fishermen draw them up in the morning the tunny rises at the same time towards the surface ready to catch any fish that drop out a strong hook baited with a herring and fixed to a rope is immediately flung out and the tunny seldom fails taking it but as soon as hooked loses all spirit and after very little resistance submits to its fate  They do not come in shoals like the tunnies of the  Mediterranean  for not above two or three are taken in a night which are dragged on shore and cut up either to be sold fresh to the people who carry them to the country markets or else are salted in large casks  The flesh when fresh cut looks exactly like raw beef but when boiled looks very pale and has something of the flavor of salmon  One that I saw  Sept    was feet inches long the

in the  Museum  at  Oxford  and probably are young ones  Seals are found in great numbers on the north coast of  Scotland  and are seen floating amidst the waves near the foot of the rocks They prey entirely on fish never  molesting the birds which swim with great composure amongst them they eat their prey beneath the water and if they are devouring any very oily fish the place is known by a certain smoothness of the waves immediately above  On the coast of  Caithness  are immense caverns opening into the sea and running some hundreds of yards beneath the land these are the resort of seals in the breeding time where they continue till their young are old enough to go to sea which is in about six or seven weeks The first of these caves is near the  Ord  the last near  Thrumster  their entrance is so extremely narrow as only to admit a boat their inside very spatious and lofty In the month of  October  or the beginning of  November  the sealhunters enter the mouths of the caverns about midnight and rowing up as far as they can they land each of them being provided with a bludgeon and properly stationed light their torches and make a great noise which brings down the seals from the further end in a confused body with frightful shrieks and cries at first the men are obliged to give way for fear of being overborn but when the first crowd is past kill as many as straggle behind chiefly the young by striking them on the nose a very slight blow on that part dispatches  them When the work is over they drag the seals to the boat which two men are left to guard This is a most hazardous employ for should their torches go out or the wind blow hard from sea during their continuance in the cave their lives are lost The young seals are most esteemed yielding more oil than their emaciated dams above eight gallons having been got from a single whelp the oil sells from  d  to  d  per gallon the skins from  d  to  d  The growth of the seals is very sudden the sealhunters say that after nine tides from their birth hours they are as active as their parents this is certain that a whelp which yields that great quantity of oil is not above five or six weeks old

exceedingly sprightly and full of frolick and shews great agility in its boundings round a room is very fond of honey and carraway comfits and is commonly observed to eat its own dung before a storm

horse by its long residence among us may be said to be naturalized therefore we hope to be excused for introducing it here notwithstanding its foreign descent From its great beauty it may be presumed that it derives its lineage from  Monaki Shaduhi of the pure race of horses purer than milk  Vide the  Arabian  certificate in a following note for the meaning of this phrase    Arabia  produces these noble animals in the highest perfection first because they take their origin from the wild unmixed breeds that formerly were found in the deserts  Leo Africanus  who wrote in the time of  Leo  X says that in his days great numbers of wild horses were found in the  Numidian  and  Arabian  deserts which were broke for use He adds that the trial of their swiftness was made against the  Lant  or the  Ostrich  and if they could overtake either of those animals they were valued at a hundred camels  Hist Africa    which had as little degenerated from their primaeval form and powers as the lion tiger or any other creature which still remains in a state of nature unchanged by the discipline of man or harvested provision  The  Arabs  place their chief delight in this animal it is to them  As a proof of this receive the following lamentation of an  Arab  obliged thro' poverty to part with his mare  My eyes  says he to the animal  my soul must I be so unfortunate as to have sold thee to so many masters and not to keep thee myself I am poor my  ANTELOPE  You know well enough my honey I have brought thee up as my child I never beat nor chid thee I made as much of thee as ever I could for my life God preserve thee my dearest thou art pretty thou art lovely God defend thee from the looks of the envious  To understand the first part of this speech it must be observed that it is usual for many  Arabs  of the poorer rank to join in the purchase of a horse the original owner generally retaining one share This as well as most of the other particulars relating to the  Arabian  horse are taken from  M D'Arvieux  's curious account of  Arabia  p  London    as dear as their family and is indeed part of it men women children mares and foals all lie in one common tent and they lodge promiscuously without fear of injury  This constant intercourse produces a familiarity that could not otherwise be effected and creates a tractability in the horses that could arise only from a

Several things concur to maintain this perfection in the horses of  Arabia  such as the great care the  Arabs  take in preserving the breed genuine by permitting none but stallions of the first form to have access to the mares this is never done but in the presence of a witness the secretary of the  Emir  or some publick officer he asserts the fact records the name of the horse mare and whole pedigree of each and these attestations  The reader is here presented with an original attestation some of which  M D' Arvieux  says have been preserved for above years in the publick records  Taken before ABDORRAMAN KADI of ACCA  The Occasion of this present Writing or Instrument is that at ACCA in the House of  Badi  legal establish'd Judge appear'd in Court  Thomas Usgate  the English Conful and with him  Sheikh Morad Ebnal Hajj Abdollah Sheikh  of the County of  Safad  and the said Consul desir'd from the aforesaid  Sheikh  proof of the race of the Grey Horse which he bought of him and He affirm'd to be  Monaki Shadûhi  These are the Names of the Breeds of Arab Horses which are reckon'd pure and true and those which are of both these breeds by Father and Mother are the most noble and free from Bastardy  but he was not satisfied with this but desir'd the Testimony of the  Arabs  who bred the Horse and knew how he came to  Sheikh Morad  whereupon there appear'd certain  Arabs  of Repute whose Names are undermention'd who testified and declar'd that the Grey Horse which the Consul formerly bought of  Sheikh Morad  is  Monaki Shadûki  of the pure Race of Horses purer than Milk  A Proverbial Expression  and that the beginning of the Affair was that  Sheikh Saleh Sheikh  of  Alsabal  bought him of the  Arabs  of the Tribe of  al Mohammadat  and  Sheikh Saleh  sold him to  Sheikh Morad Ebn al Hajj Abdollah Sheikh  of  Safad  and  Sheikh Morad  sold him to the Consul aforesaid when these Matters appear'd to us and the Contents were known the said Gentleman desir'd a Certificate thereof and Testimony of the Witnesses whereupon we wrote him this Certificate for him to keep as a Proof thereof  i e    Jany    Dated Friday of the latter  Rabi  in the Year  Witnesses

depends the future price of the foal  The  Arabs  whose riches are their horses take all imaginable care of them they have it not in their power to give them grass in their hot climate except in the spring their  constant food is barley and that given only in the night being never suffered to eat during the day  In the daytime they are kept saddled at the door of the tent ready for any excursion their masters may make the  Arabs  being fond of the chace and living by the plundering of travellers The horses are never hurt by any servile employ never injured by heavy burthens or by long journies enjoy a pure dry air due exercise great temperance and great care  Every horse in  Arabia  except those which by way of contempt are called  Guidich  or pack horses has a degree of good qualities superior to those of other places but it is not to be supposed but that there are certain parts of that country which have attained a higher perfection in the art of management than others  Thus we find by some late information  Wall  on horses  that  Yemine  in  Arabia Felix  is at present in great repute for its breed for the jockies of that part have acquired such a superior name as to be able to sell their three year old horses for two or three hundred guineas apiece and when they can be prevailed on to part with a favorite  stallion  they will not take less for it than fifteen hundred guineas It is from this country that the great men in  India  are supplied with horses for  India  itself is possessed of a very bad kind  These noble animals being much neglected there from the constant use of the  Buffalo  not only in tillage but even in riding  It may be allowed here to give some account of the horses of other countries which derive their origin and at lest receive their improvement from the  Arabian  kind for wheresoever the  Saracens  spread their victorious arms they at the same time introduced their generous race of horses  Those of  Persia  are light swift and very like those of  Arabia  but formed very narrow before they are fed with chopped straw mixed with barley and instead of soiling are fed with neweared or green barley for about fourteen or twenty days  Tavernier's Travels  I    Aethiopia  has with some writers the credit of having originally furnished  Arabia  with its fine race of horses but we believe the reverse and that they were introduced into that empire by the  Arabian  princes whose lineage to this day fills that throne The horses of that country are spirited and strong and generally of a black color they are never used in long journies but only in battle or in the race for all servile work is done by mules the  Aethiopians  never shoe them for which reason on passing thro' stony  places they dismount and ride on mules and lead their horses  Ludolph hist Aethiop    so from this we may collect that this nation is not less attached to these animals than the  Arabs  Aegypt  has two breeds of horses one its own the other  Arabian  the last are most esteemed and are bought up at a great price in order to be sent to  Constantinople  but such is the discouragement arising from the tyranny of the government that the owners often wilfully lame a promising horse  Univ modern hist  quoted from  Maillet Pocock  lest the  Beys  should like it and force it from them  Barbary  owes its fine horses to the same stock which in general are far inferior in point of value and for the same reason as is given in the last article the great insecurity of property under the  Turkish  government The breed was once very famous M  D'arvieux  D'arvieux    says that when he was there in he met with a mare that he thought worthy of the stud of his  grand Monarque  when in the height of his glory but  Doctor Shaw  informs us that at present the case is entirely altered  Shaw's travels      Notwithstanding  Spain  has been celebrated of old for the swiftness of its horses yet it must have received great improvement from those brought over by their conquerors the  Saracens  According to  Oppian  Cyneg lib  I v  the  Spanish  breed had no other merit than that of fleetness but at present we know that they have several other fine qualities  To sum up the account of this generous animal we may observe that every country that boasts of a fine race of horses is indebted to  Arabia  their primaeval seat No wonder then that the poetic genius of the author of the book of  Job  who not only lived on the very spot but even at a time when the animal creation still enjoyed much of its original perfection should be able

opinion among fishermen that at a certain season of the year these fish are blind and they assert they have taken them with a film over their eyes  Martin  relates something to this purpose in his voyage to  Spitsbergen  p he says he took  June    some mackrel near the isle of  St Kilda  that were half blind occasioned by a black skin which grows over their eyes in winter and comes off the

of Mr RAY'S  Sylloge stirpium  EUROPAEARUM  extra Britannias  Stirpium  Europoearum  extra  Britannias  nascentium Sylloge  has been so fully approved by the travelling Botanist it is thought a similar enumeration of the Species of certain classes of the animal kingdom would be equally agreeable and serviceable to the traveling Zoologist It comprehends the  extraBritannic  Quadrupeds Birds and Reptiles of  Europe  formed from the works of the general Naturalists from the  Fauna  of different countries and from my own observations The arrangement of the subjects are according to the excellent method of our countryman Mr RAY a little altered or reformed As there are not at this instant  English  names for most of the articles we have been obliged to substitute those used by  Linnoeus  and other foreign writers but to gratify the  English  reader's curiosity who may wish for fuller accounts of the quadrupeds in his own language we refer him to the second column to out own  synopsis  of  Quadrupeds  speedily to be published and in respect to the birds to the  English  edition of Mr WILLUGHBY'S  Ornithology  CLASS I QUADRUPEDIA QUADRUPEDS     I                    Lin  Syn
