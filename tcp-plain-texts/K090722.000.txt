 A SUPPLEMENT TO THE STATE OF THE EXPEDITION FROM CANADA CONTAINING GENERAL BURGOYNE's ORDERS RESPECTING THE PRINCIPAL MOVEMENTS AND OPERATIONS OF THE ARMY TO THE RAISING OF THE SIEGE OF TICONDEROGA  LONDON PRINTED FOR J ROBSON NEWBONDSTREET T BECKET THE CORNER OF THE ADELPHI STRAND AND R BALDWIN PATERNOSTERROW MDCCLXXX  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  ADVERTISEMENT  THE editor does not undertake to lay before the public the whole of General  Burgoyne  's orders during the campaign of    In so extensive a detail many would appear quite uninteresting at the present moment and even at the time they were given except perhaps to the departments immediately concerned as far as regarded their execution such are those respecting the daily duties the hospital the commiserate drivers c Those only have been selected that have for their object the general arrangements and movements of the army and which may tend to illustrate the operations of the campaign There are likewise some few by Generals  Carleton  and  Philips  which are introduced here as relating in particular to General  Burgoyne  's expedition  The editor's principal inducement for offering these orders to the public was drawn not only from the idea that the  state of the expedition is incomplete without them but likewise from the observation of the avidity with which General  Wolfe  's orders were received by all ranks of people and particularly by the officers of the army It was conceived that if General  Wolfe  's orders were esteemed as models to commanding officers of corps as well as instructive lessons in their profession to those of an inferior rank General  Burgoyne  's would more fully answer that description as they relate to military transactions far more important and to scenes infinitely more interesting to the publicBeside that the author of them is known to add to the knowledge and experience of the General all the exterior graces and refinement of the scholar and the writer  It is but justice to his Excellency the LieutenantGeneral to acknowledge that these orders are published without his concurrence or authority  GENERAL ORDERS  By General Carleton  Quebec  May  THE King having been pleased to order that a detachment from the army under my command be sent upon an expedition under Lieutenantgeneral Burgoyne and that this detachment be composed of the grenadiers lightinfantry and th regiment together with the th th st th d and d regiments except a detachment of men from each of the six lastmentioned regiments and all the German troops except a detachment of these corps will accordingly hold themselves in readiness to march at the shortest notice orders for which will be given by Lieutenantgeneral Burgoyne to whom in the mean time they will make all reports as well as to the commander in chief The detachments of with a captain two subalterns and noncommissioned officers in proportion from each of the six regiments as above will assemble at the present headquarters of their respective regiments and there remain until further orders  The artillery the department of the quartermastergeneral hospital and commiserate will likewise supply Lieutenantgeneral Burgoyne  with such returns as he may call for to enable him to lay before the commander in chief the portions of the several articles they are capable of furnishing  Two hundred days bat baggage and forage money will be issued to the general and staff officers the hospital regiments Lieutenant Nutt's detachment and the three companies of Canadians the distribution lists of which are to be sent in as soon as possible to the paymastergeneral's office  By General Philips  Quebec  May st  MAjorgeneral Philips has been directed by the commander in chief to inform the commanding officers of regiments of his excellency's desire that the army should take the field this campaign in the most perfect order  This will depend so entirely upon the several regiments being prepared by exercise and discipline▪ that it is recommended to you to employ the utmost care and attention on such material points where your own character and honour are so intimately connected with the duty and good of his Majesty's service  His excellency the commander in chief has instructed Majorgeneral Philips to observe to you that the good discipline of a regiment in its general oeconomy behaviour and conduct in action will depend on the attention of that respectable rank of gentlemen the commanding officers of companies  It is from this rank of officers whose time of service and experience give them every possible weight and respect in a regiment that the subaltern officers are to take their example and their orders It is by the captains that the younger officers are to be instructed not only in the common military rules but in that propriety of conduct strict subordination and indefatigable attention so absolutely requisite in a  regiment and by which alone the soldiers can be held in that obedience to and confidence in their officers which will make them bear the fatigues hardships and dangers of a campaign with patience with zeal and with spirit  Courage has ever belonged to the British troops and there needs only to observe that a well disciplined body will always add to it a most essential principle in warconduct  It is necessary that the officers should be perfectly acquainted with the soldiers of their company and that soldiers should know their officers and be accustomed to the sound of their voices The exercising by companies will be the surest means to effect those purposes  It is well understood that all regiments exercise by companies but it is usually done with a view of joining in battalion It is here meant that each company should be led to consider itself as a small distinct body and exercised in various evolutions independent of the battalion▪ with every possible view for single companies being taught to depend upon themselves  As from the nature of the present war the abilities and military skill of officers may be required to be shown in detached parties and as it may frequently happen that single companies will have to act when an entire battalion cannot always manoeuvre by pursuing this idea which the commander in chief has expressed a strong desire of it will leave the officers and soldiers a dependence and attention on each other and give confidence to both  It will therefore be proper for every officer of a company to be perfectly well acquainted with and to exercise that companyfor the commanding officer of a battalion to put himself at the head of one company and to manoeuvre that company while the other companies being drawn up at small intervals of distance follow the evolutions so given by the commanding officer  As the commander in chief has already ordered regiments in their exercise to make frequent changes of their positions and fronts and to march over difficult ground it will give the commanding officers of companies opportunities of showing a ready power of taking good posts and also though there may be certain separations owing to inclosures ravines ditches of water marshy ground c of connecting the companies one with another and with the battalion  Whenever a regiment when marching or manoeuvring is obliged to break into parts from marshy ground ravines ditches small hills rocks or thick underwood it should be done if possible by companies which should divide as little as possible and never but in such parts as an officer or serjeant may have command of such separate division and this not at the will of the soldier but from the distinct orders of the officers so that the separated divisions may join as soon as the ground will permit into companies and from companies into battalion  The changing the order of companies at times in drawing up the battalion will make the soldiers ready in forming on general principles without regarding local stations of companies  His excellency has in view by this that the soldiers learn to be steady and attached to their own company and its officersthat the officers having a thorough knowledge of their men and being accustomed to such instances of separation as have been described suffer not the soldiers to act but from their words of command and ordersthat every company may form a respectable body singly and though attached to its place in battalion yet always ready to act separate from it as the nature of the ground may require or the nature of the local service they may be sent on make necessary  Majorgeneral Philips has endeavoured to explain the commander in chief's pleasure by signifying how much his excellency depends  on the support of captains commanding companies in this army and there can be no doubt of every respectable and attentive obedience to his excellency's injunctions and orders The commander in chief has not directed any thing relative to commanding officers and field officers of battalions as his excellency as well as every general officer of the army has reason to depend on their experience and to be assured of the strong exertion and active and spirited zeal of the fieldofficers for the particular character and credit of their own corps and for the honour of his Majesty's service  By General Burgoyne  Montreal  May th  THE regiments destined for the expedition under Lieutenant General Burgoyne are to leave in their respective stores their blanket coats leggings and all baggage that can be spared during the summer months  The officers are depended upon not to incumber the service with more baggage than is absolutely necessary for a campaign where the movements may be expected to be sudden and alert The portions of batteaux to each regiment will be regulated on those principles Three women per company will be allowed to follow the army  The exercise of the troops under the Lieutenant General's orders is to be confined to firing with ballcartridges bayonets fixed and rapidity of movements in marching evolutions and forming  By General Carleton  Quebec  June  THE st regiment is to move immediately to the posts of St John's and the Isle aux Noix four companies to each place One company of those at the Isle aux Noix to move to the river Lacolle in case Majorgeneral Philips shall think it necessary and signify the  same to them The companies at all these posts to be aiding and assisting in transporting provisions stores and all things necessary for the troops under Lieutenantgeneral Burgoyne  The th regiment to march and encamp at or near St Therese detaching two companies to Chamblée This regiment will likewise be aiding and assisting in forwarding every thing necessary for General Burgoyne's army  The royal highland emigrants will detach a company to Sorel for the like purpose and Brigadiergeneral Maclean will make a tour to the places on that river and order such part of his regiment to take post there as he finds may be necessary for the above purposes or for assisting the officers of militia in executing the orders sent to them  GENERAL DISPOSITION OF THE ARMY  St John's  June th  BRigadiergeneral Fraser will be joined by the Canadian companies of Monin and Busherville Captain Fraser's detachment and a body of savages  The German grenadiers chasseurs and lightinfantry under the command of Lieutenantcolonel Breymen form a corps de reserve and will never encamp in the line  The regiment of Reidesel's dragoons is also not of the line and for the present will be employed to cover headquarters  The Provincial corps of Peters and Jessup are also not of the line The recruits of the d regiment under the command of Lieutenant N  tt are for the present to serve on board the fleet

battalions Left wing first brigade of Germans commanded by Brigadiergeneral Specht composed of the regiments of Rhentz Specht and Reidesel second brigade of Germans commanded by Brigadiergeneral Gall and composed of the regiments of Prince Frederick and Hesse Hanau  If it should become necessary to form two lines the second line is to form by the second brigade of British doubling upon the first and by the second brigade of Germans doubling in like manner on their first The brigadiers are always to encamp with their brigade  Camp at River Bouquet  June th  OFFICERS of all ranks commanding outposts and detachments are constantly to fortify in the best manner the circumstances of the place and the implements at hand will permit felling trees with their points outwards barricading churches and houses Breastworks of earth and timber are generally to be effected in a short time and the science of engineering is not necessary to find and apply such resources  The practice of fortifying is useful in all services but especially in this where the enemy though infinitely inferior to the King's troops in open space and hardy combat is well fitted by disposition and practice for the stratagems and enterprizes of little war and neither the distance of camps nor the interference of forests and rivers are to be looked upon as security against their attempts Upon the same principle  it must be a constant rule in or near woods to place advanced sentries where they have a tree or some other defence to prevent them from being taken off by single marksmen Together with these precautions officers will ever bear in mind how much the public honour and their own are concerned in maintaining a post and that to justify a retreat in this war the number of the enemy must be much superior to that which would make their justification when acting against a brave and disciplined force  The officers will take all opportunities and especially at the beginning of the campaign to inculcate into the minds of the men a reliance upon the bayonet Men of half their bodily strength and even cowards may be their match at firing but the onset of bayonets in the hands of the valiant is irresistible  The enemy convinced of this truth place their dependence in entrenchments and riflepiecesit will be our glory and preservation to storm where possible The attention of every officer is to be employed on his men to make use of his fusil unless in very extraordinary cases of immediate personal defence would betray an ignorance of his importance and of his duty  No occasion can make it necessary to keep the arms loaded in the bell tents nor are the battalions of the line ever to be loaded on the march till very near the time they may happen to engage  No parties are to go from camp with or without arms unless with a proportionable number of officersNot only the discipline and honour but even the safety of the troops require the strictest prohibition from straggling and plundering and the savages as well as the provost will have orders to punish all offenders in these respects instantly and with the utmost rigour  The camp will always be extended as widely as the ground will admit for the sake of cleanliness and healthbut as it must often happen that the extent will be insufficient for the line to form in front of the camp according to the present established rules of open files and two deepthe quartermastergeneral will therefore mark out at every new camp the proportion of ground each battalion is to clear over and above its own front in order to make the work equal To clear this ground must be the immediate business after arriving in camp and in this country it may be often necessary to have an alarmpost cleared in the rear as well as in frontBy clearing is meant the removal of such obstructions as might prevent the ready forming of troops to receive or advance upon the enemy  Quarter guards are always to face outwards and at the distance of one hundred yards from the bells of arms with a flêche of earth or timber thrown up before them When the encampment of the line is with the front to the water and too near to admit of this regulation the quarter guard is to be posted in the rear or those of the flank regiments occasionally upon the flanks Though the ground will seldom admit a strict regularity in pitching the officers tents they are never to be placed so as to interfere with the line of defence  When the Lieutenantgeneral visits an outpost the men are not to stand to their arms or pay him any compliment The articles of war which regard the men to be read at the head of every regiment tomorrow at evening parade and afterwards these regulations  The daily duties are to be as followsOne Brigadiergeneral for the day who will visit the outposts and have a general inspection of the camp All reports to be made through him except when any alarm or other exigence requires instant notice to the commander in chiefA major of brigade for the day who is to parade all guards detachments c The picquet when the last brigade arrives will consist of one fieldofficer for each wing one captain each brigade one subaltern  one serjeant one corporal and twenty men each regimenta drummer to be furnished by the regiment that gives the captain The whole picquet to assemble half an hour before gunfiring at the centre of the line and to be exercised in marching and charging bayonets under the inspection of the brigadier of the day in order that the British and German troops may acquire an uniformity of pace and motions when acting together in the line Half the picquet is always to be posted during the night at some distance from the camp and at such places as may be exposed to the secret approaches of the enemy It will be the care of the brigadier of the day to post them  Camp at Crownpoint  June  SHOULD it be necessary for the line to embark suddenly two guns will be fired on the right wing Upon the signal being given the mens tents to be struck immediately and stowed in the batteaux together with their knapsacks blankets provision and ammunitionAs no other stores will be allowed to be carried▪ seventeen batteaux will suffice for each battalion of British and twentytwo for each German battalion Should it be necessary for the line to march suddenly without embarking four guns will be fired from the rightat which signal the line is to form with all possible expedition in front of the bells of arms and the tents to be left standing This order to remain in force during the campaign  Headquarters at Skeensboroughhouse  July  ON the sixth the enemy was dislodged from Ticonderoga by the mere countenances and activity of the army and driven on the same day beyond Skeensborough on the right and Hubberton on the left with the loss of all their artillery and five of their armed vessels  taken or blown up by the spirited conduct of Captain Carter of the artillery with part of his brigade of gunboats a great quantity of ammunition provision and stores of all sorts and all their baggage  On the th Brigadier Fraser with little more than half the advanced corps and without artillery which with the utmost endeavours it was found impossible to bring up came up with of the enemy strongly posted attacked and defeated them with the loss on the enemy's side of their principal officers men killed on the spot a much greater number wounded and taken prisoners  On the th Lieutenantcolonel Hill at the head of the ninth regiment was attacked near Fort Anne by more than six times his number and repulsed the enemy with great loss after a continued fire of three hours In consequence of this action Fort Anne was burnt and abandoned and a part of this army is in possession of the country on the other side  These rapid successes after exciting a proper sense of what we owe to God intitles the troops in general to the warmest praiseand particular distinction is due to Brigadiergeneral Fraser who by his conduct and bravery supported by the officers and soldiers under his command effected an exploit of material service to the king and of signal honour to the profession of arms This corps have the further merit of having supported fatigue and bad weather without bread and without murmur  Divine service will be performed on Sunday morning at the head of the line and at the head of the advanced corps and on the same day at sunset a feudejoye will be fired with cannon and smallarms from Ticonderoga Crownpoint the camp at Skeensborough and the post of Breymen's corps  Skeensboroughhouse  July  IT is observed that the injunctions before the army took the field relative to the baggage of officers has not been complied with and that the regiments in general are incumbered with much more baggage than they can possibly be supplied with means of conveying when they quit the lakes and rivers warning is therefore given to the officers to convey by the batteaux which will soon return to Ticonderoga the baggage that is not indispensably necessary to them or upon the first sudden movement it must inevitably be left on the ground Such gentlemen as served in America last war may remember that officers took up with a soldiers tent and confined their baggage to a knapsack for months together  When opportunity shall offer to carry forward the baggage which will be left at Ticonderoga so as not to interfere with the transport of magazines the Lieutenantgeneral will be happy to contribute to the convenience and comfort of his officers  Skeensboroughhouse  July  THE disturbance of the th instant between the British troops and the Germans was occasioned by liquor and one of the first principles of military order was so far forgotten by some British soldiers that a guard was insulted Any conduct for the future either of Germans or British that shall tend to obstruct the harmony which has hitherto so happily reigned between the two nations and which must continue among brave troops serving in the same cause unless violated by intoxication or misapprehension will be punished as a crime the most fatal to the success and honour of the campaign  Camp at Fort Edward  Aug  IT appearing that there is still some misapprehension in some corps of the army respecting the carriage of officers baggage when the service shall make it necessary to quit the riversit is henceforward to be understood that no provision has been made by the King's orders nor by those of his Excellency Sir Guy Carleton for this purpose nor is there any example of such being made when the allowance of bât and forage money has been in the proportion of that granted the last and present year to the army in Canada Such gentlemen therefore as have not already understood this general system of the service will provide themselves by purchase as opportunity offers always remembering that the prohibition of purchasing from savages is still in force  Duer Camp  August  IT was endeavoured among other objects by the expedition which marched to the left to provide such a supply of cattle as would have enabled the army to proceed without waiting the arrival of the magazines That attempt having failed of success through the chances of war the troops must necessarily halt some days for bringing forward the transport of provisions and the several corps will employ that time to collect the sick convalescents and such other parties as are merely employed in regimental duties  Duer Camp  August  IT having been observed a common practice for officers to order to be taken from the provision train in the service of the king for this army the carts and horses for the carrying of baggage and other purposes to avoid for the future this danger and inconvenience to the  service it is in the most positive manner ordered that no cart or horse is to be used but for the public transport of the army nor is any officer accidentally coming to any particular post to interfere with the provision train in any other manner than to give it every aid and assistance in his power which he is on all occasions to do  Camp near Batten Kill  Aug  THE Lieutenantgeneral having received a report from Lieutenantcolonel Breymen relative to the action of Saintcoick Mills and likewise having received every collateral information possible thinks it but justice to declare publickly that he has no reason to be dissatisfied with the personal spirit of the troops that on the contrary the officers commanding corps acted with intrepidity on that occasion The failure of the enterprise seems to be owing in the first instance to the credulity of those who managed the department of intelligence who suffered great numbers of the rebels to pass and repass and perhaps to count the number of the detachment and upon illgrounded confidence induced Lieutenantcolonel Baume to advance too far The next cause was the slow movement of Lieutenantcolonel Breymen who from bad weather bad roads and tired horses together with other impediments stated by Lieutenantcolonel Brehmen could not reach miles from eight in the morning of the th to four in the afternoon of the th The succour therefore arrived too late The failure of ammunition in the management of which there seems to have been some improvidence was another misfortune the rest seem common occurrences of war Upon the whole the enemy has felt very little success and there is no circumstance to affect the army with further regret or melancholy than that which arises from the loss of some gallant menBut let the affair of the mill of Saintcoick remain henceforward as a lesson against the imposition of a treacherous enemy many of whom in the very hour of swearing allegiance to the  king fought▪against his troops and against expending ammunition too fast which obliged conquering troops to retreat The reflexion on this affair will moreover excite alertness and exertion in every corps marching to the support of another by showing in whatever degree these qualities may be possessed by the commanding officers and they are not to be doubted in the present instance yet unless they are general common accidents may become fatal in the course of two hours may decide the turn of an expedition and may even decide in some cases the fate of a campaign  Batten Kill  Aug  GREAT irregularities having been committed by conductors and other followers of the army camp courtsmartial will occasionally be assembled in the nature of a general courtmartial consisting of one captain and four subalterns from the line who will try such offenders according to the clause in the mutiny act which subjects all followers of the army to military law  As long as a brigadier shall be on duty at Ticonderoga the brigadier with the army shall command both brigades  Batten Kill  Aug  STRICT oeconomy in the receipt and delivery of provisions at all times an essential duty now becomes an object of the greatest consequence The fate of the campaign may depend upon it and as the preservation of the live cattle demands the most particular attention they are only to be slaughtered for the sick and in such cases as are absolutely necessary  The commanding officers are therefore to send in an account upon honour of the fresh provisions necessary for their sick to the commissary the day before the general issue of provisions to the army and be responsible that the proper deduction of rations is made for the fresh provision received  Whenever the stock of cattle shall be sufficient to admit of it every attention shall be paid to the comfort and convenience of officers and notice will be given when they can be supplied with rations of fresh provisions instead of salt  The Lieutenantgeneral meaning that every regiment should be on the same regulation directs that the servants and bâtmen be allowed as follows     Servants  Bâtmen  Field officer      Captain      Subalterns of a company      When the mens tents are carried on bâthorses a bâtman to be allowed to each company  The servants to be considered as effective in the ranks and to attend every evening parade The other parades at rollcallings they are exempted from unless the regiments are under arms The bâtmen to be always armed and to form the baggageguard The commanding officers of regiments will take care that this order be complied with strictly  Whenever cattle are killed it must be always at nightthe commissaries are made answerable for this All cattle brought into camp to be sent to the board of regulation and by that board to be sent to the commissarygeneral The troops must be sensible that buying  cattle privately and by that means preventing a general supply must prove very injurious to the service  Batten Kill  September  THE additional companies to be divided between the eight battalion companies of each regiment The men now wanting to complete are to be filled up and the supernumeraries to be accounted with by a particular pay bill and a particular account kept and regulated by the commandingofficer of each company  Batten Kill  September  THE army will march in a very short time Each regiment will therefore make such inspection and preparation in regard to their sick their baggage and their regimental arrangements as will permit them to move alertly and with their ranks as strong as possible  The surgeons of regiments to meet the surgeons of the hospital at fort Miller at one o'clock tomorrow in order to concert proper measures for the future conduct of the sick▪ and for keeping in a correct manner a proper communication between the regimental and general hospitals  Camp at Saratoga  September  THE army may be required to take arms at the shortest notice Officers therefore are not to quit the camp and no soldier or follower of the army is to pass the Fishkill on pain of the severest punishment  The present post of the six companies of the th regiment being dismissed to cover the depôt of provisions these companies are not to take any duties of the line but will augment their picquet to men  which during the night will occupy a post on the island and another on the point of land on the south side of the Fishkill where it falls into the river  The th regiment will advance four companies to cover headquartersThey will bring their tents and receive orders from Sir Francis Clarke  The picquets and quarterguards of the line to be posted on the right flank of the incampment so as to form a line with the British light infantry  If it should be necessary to form the line of battle in that front the regiments will march to it by two columns the th regiment followed by the st making the column on the right and the d regiment followed by the th making the column on the left in order to fill up the place between the corps of General Fraser and colonel BrehemnBrigadier Hamilton will order a communication and mark it to the commanding officers in such a manner that it may be made in the night time with alertness and without confusion  When Majorgeneral Philips shall have directed the roads proper for the park of artillery in this movement they are to be reconnoitred by their respective officers that their march may not clash with the column  If this movement is made the th regiment keeps its ground and is to defend it to the last against any attack from the other side of the water and the four companies that cover the headquarters are to take post in the redoubt above the bridge that leads to headquarters  In case of any movement from this side of Hudson's river Majorgeneral Reidesel will form the left wing of the army at the head of their incampment but not march off their ground The quartermasters  and campcolourmen of the left wing are to mark out their ground tomorrow morning but that wing is not to pass the river till the last of the depôt has crossed the bridge for the expediting which purpose all the departments concerned are to use their utmost diligence  Camp at Saratoga  September  DURING the next march of the army the corps are to move in such a state as to be fit for instant action It is therefore unavoidably necessary to circumspect more than is at present done brigade conveyances in regard to attendance upon baggage cattle and other inferior purposes  The brigadiers will collect tomorrow from the commandingofficers of corps under their command a report of the number of rank and file each corps can march and how the rest are disposed of  It is to be a standing order for the rest of the campaign that all picquets and guards are to be under arms an hour before daylight every morning and so continue till it is quite light All outposts and outlying picquets to send patroles at the same time  Camp near Swordshouse  September  TO the great reproach of discipline of the common sense of soldiers who have been made prisoners the service has sustained a loss within these few days that might have cost some hundreds of the enemy to have brought on in action The Lieutenantgeneral will no longer bear to lose men for the pitiful consideration of potatoes or forage The soldier is the property of the king and since friendly admonitions repeated injunctions and corporal punishment will have no effect the army is now to be informed and it is not doubted the commandingofficers will do it solemnly that the first  soldier caught beyond the advanced sentries of the army will be instantly hanged  In case of an action the Lieutenantgeneral will be found near the British line or he will leave word there where he may be followed and a subalternofficer is to be sent from each of the following corps viz one from the British line one from Brigadiergeneral Fraser's corps and one who speaks French from the left wing These officers to be on horseback  Camp on Braemus Heights  September  AS parties are to be employed today in making roads in order to advance towards the enemy it is the general's orders that the several corps incamp on their present ground immediately  The Lieutenantgeneral having had an opportunity of observing the conduct of the troops on all parts in the action of the th instant thinks it incumbent on him to give his public testimony of the exemplary spirit of the officers in general and in many instances of the private men In both these distinctions the artillery is to be included and the brigade under Captain Jones deserves a peculiar place His warmest thanks to Majorgeneral Philips cannot be omitted on any occasion when added to the service of the department under his immediate inspection he finds himself under great obligation for a most able and zealous second in command  The zeal and spirit of Majorgeneral Reidesel also deserves the Lieutenantgeneral's acknowledgement The regular fire given by the troops he brought up and the good countenance of the Germans were fully noticed  Brigadiergeneral Fraser took his position at the beginning of the day with great judgment and sustained the action with his usual presence of mind and vigour  Brigadiergeneral Hamilton acquitted himself honourably by his activity and conduct during an action of several hours  Amidst these several actions of applause the impetuosity and uncertain aim of the British troops in giving their fire and the mistake they are still under of preferring it to the bayonet is much to be lamented The Lieutenantgeneral is persuaded this error will be corrected in the next engagement upon the conviction of their own reason and reflexion as well as upon that general precept of discipline never to fire but by order of an officer  One hundred and twenty brave men of courage and fidelity from the provincial corps of Jessup Peters M  c  Alpin and M  c  Kay are to be incorporated for this campaign only into the six British regiments in the proportion of twenty to a regiment They will have a certificate from under the hand of the Lieutenantgeneral to intitle them to a discharge on the th day of December next They will besides receive a gratuity on being incorporated and another at the expiration of their service and these will be the whole number required this campaign Those corps whose establishment is to take place on a certain number of men being raised are allowed to recommend those furnished upon this occasion as part of that number  Braemus Heights  Sept  ALL picquet quarter and rear guards to send out patroles round their respective posts continually The men off duty are to accoutre this night at twelve o'clock and hold themselves in readiness to turn out when ordered  All the drivers to be assembled this evening at the time of rollcalling at the different detachments and to be informed that seven men to those who deserted have been scalped by the enemy's Indians and that the Indians belonging to our camp are in pursuit of the rest They are also to be informed that the first deserter taken belonging to them will be hanged  Braemus Heights  Sept  THE Lieutenantgeneral has received intelligence of an attempt made by the enemy on Ticonderoga in which they have miscarried and retired but have made prisoners some part of the d regiment posted on the carryingplace of Lake George Till circumstances are more authentically known it will be an act of injustice to accuse any officer of so great a fault as suffering a surprise but the occasion cannot be overlooked of repeating to officers in general the necessity of vigilance and unremitting alertness on their posts and of warning them that no distance of the enemy or situation of the ground is security or excuse if they are off their guard  ERRATUM  Page    last line but two for  countenances  read  countenance  FINIS
