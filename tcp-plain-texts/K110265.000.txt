 THE POETICAL WORKS OF RICHARD WEST  simplex nec despice carmen  Nec vatem non illa leves primordia motus  Quanquam parva dabunt  GRAY  de Princip Cogit  Just Heav'n what sin ere life begins to bloom  Devotes my head untimely to the tomb  Did e'er this hand against a brother's life  Drug the dire bowl or point the murd'rous knife  Did e'er this tongue the sland'rer's tale proclaim  Or madly violate my Maker's name  Did e'er this heart betray a friend or foe  Or know a thought but all the world might know  But why repine does life deserve my sigh  Few will lament my loss whene'er I die  Yet some there are ere spent my vital days  Within whose breasts my tomb I wish to raise  Lov'd in my life lamented in my end  Their praise would crown me as their precepts mend  To them may these fond lines my name endear  Not from the poet but the friend sincere  AD AMICOS  EDINBURG AT THE  Apollo Press  BY THE MARTINS  Anno    MISCELLANIES  Advertisement  THE life of Mr West was so short and the events of it so few that it was judged better to insert the anecdotes which remain of this hopeful youth in the preceding account of his friend than to reserve them for a detached article Mr Walpole wished to see their Works united in one volume The only objection of Mr Gray to this wish no longer now remains Had he complied with Mr Walpole's desire it is the opinion of Mr Mason that he would have given only the poems which follow  AD AMICOS  Imitated from Tibullus book iii elegy and Mr Pope's letter in sickness to Mr Steele  YES happy youths on Camus' sedgy side  You feel each joy that friendship can divide  Each realm of science and of art explore  And with the ancient blend the modern lore  Studious alone to learn whate'er may tend  To raise the genius or the heart to mend  Now pleas'd along the cloister'd walks you rove  And trace the verdant mazes of the grove  Where social oft' and oft' alone ye chuse  To catch the zephir and to court the Muse  Meantime at me while all devoid of art  These lines give back the image of my heart  At me the pow'r that comes or soon or late  Or aims or seems to aim the dart of Fate  From you remote methinks alone I stand  Like some sad exile in a desert land  Around no friends their lenient care to join  In mutual warmth and mix their heart with mine  Or real pains or those which fancy raise  For ever blot the sunshine of my days  To sickness still and still to grief a prey  Health turns from me her rosy face away  Just Heav'n what sin ere life begins to bloom  Devotes my head untimely to the tomb  Did e'er this hand against a brother's life  Drug the dire bowl or point the murd'rous knife  Did e'er this tongue the sland'rer's tale proclaim  Or madly violate my Maker's name  Did e'er this heart betray a friend or foe  Or know a thought but all the world might know  As yet just started from the lists of time  My growing years have scarcely told their prime  Useless as yet thro' life I'ave idly run  No pleasures tasted and few duties done  Ah who ere autumn's mellowing suns appear  Would pluck the promise of the vernal year  Or ere the grapes their purple hue betray  Tear the crude cluster from the mourning spray  Stern pow'r of Fate whose ebon sceptre rules  The Stygian deserts and Cimmerian pools  Forbear nor rashly smite my youthful heart  A victim yet unworthy of thy dart  Ah stay till age shall blast my with'ring face  Shake in my head and falter in my pace  Then aim the shaft then meditate the blow  And to the dead my willing shade shall go  How weak is man to Reason's judging eye  Born in this moment in the next we die  Part mortal clay and part ethereal fire  Too proud to creep too humble to aspire  In vain our plans of happiness we raise  Pain is our lot and patience is our praise  Wealth lineage honours conquest or a throne  Are what the wise would fear to call their own  Health is at best a vain precarious thing  And fairfac'd youth  "Youth at the very best is but a betrayer of human life in a gentler and smoother manner than age it is like the stream that nourishes a plant upon a bank and causes it to flourish and blossom to the sight but at the same time is undermining it at the root in secret"  Pope  is ever on the wing  'Tis like the stream  side whose wat'ry bed  Some blooming plant exalts his flow'ry head  Nurs'd by the wave the spreading branches rise  Shade all the ground and flourish to the skies  The waves the while beneath in secret flow  And undermine the hollow bank below  Wide and more wide the waters urge their way  Bare all the roots and on their fibres prey  Too late the plant bewails his foolish pride  And sinks untimely in the whelming tide  But why repine does life deserve my sigh  Few will lament my loss whene'er I die  For those the wretches  "I am not at all uneasy at the thought that many men whom I never had any esteem for are likely to enjoy this world after me"  Pope  I despise or hate  I neither envy nor regard their fate  For me whene'er allconq'ring Death shall spread  His wings around my unrepining head  I care not  "The morning after my exit the sun will rise as bright as ever the flowers smell as sweet the plants spring as green people will laugh  c  "  Pope  tho' this face be seen no more  The world will pass as cheerful as before  Bright as before the daystar will appear  The fields as verdant and the skies as clear  Nor storms nor comets will my doom declare  Nor signs on earth nor portents in the air  Unknown and silent will depart my breath  Nor Nature e'er take notice of my death  Yet some there are ere spent my vital days  Within whose breasts my tomb I wish to raise  Lov'd in my life lamented in my end  Their praise would crown me as their precepts mend  To them may these fond lines my name endear

sudden blasts that rise  And drive the zephirs from the skies  O join with mine thy tuneful lay  And invocate the tardy May  Come fairest nymph resume thy reign  Bring all the Graces in thy train  With balmy breath and flow'ry tread  Rise from thy soft ambrosial bed  Where in Elysian slumber bound  Embow'ring myrtles veil thee round  Awake in all thy glories drest  Recall the zephirs from the west  Restore the sun revive the skies  At mine and Nature's call arise  Great Nature's self upbraids thy stay  And misses her accustom'd May  See all her works demand thy aid  The labours of Pomona fade  A plaint is heard from ev'ry tree  Each budding flow'ret calls for thee  The birds forget to love and sing  With storms alone the forests ring  Come then with Pleasure at thy side  Diffuse thy vernal spirit wide  Create where'er thou turn'st thy eye  Peace plenty love and harmony  Till ev'ry being share its part  And heav'n and earth be glad at heart  TRANSLATED FROM THE GREEK OF POSIDIPPUS
