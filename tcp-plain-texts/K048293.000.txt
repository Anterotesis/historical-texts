 THE RIVAL CANDIDATES A COMIC OPERA In Two ACTS AS IT IS NOW PERFORMING AT THE THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURYLANE  By the Rev HENRY BATE  LONDON Printed Sold by T BECKET corner of the Adelphibuildings in the Strand and by W GRIFFIN No Catharinestreet MDCCLXXV  ADVERTISEMENT  THE RIVAL CANDIDATES is an attempt of the dramatic kind undertaken by the writer from no motive of literary vanity but in order to introduce to the world a young musical composer whose taste he conceived might do honour to his profession  The reformer of the English drama no sooner was informed of him than he kindly consented to an early trial of his abilities and discovered a generous anxiety for his success  The author arrogates to himself but a moderate share of that universal applause with which his piece has been received particularly when he recollects how much of it is derived from the kind attention of Mr GARRICK in the double capacity of friend and managerand what immense claims those respectable persons have who fill his little canvass with such credit to themselves and their profession To single out any one of these celebrated performers when all so kindly combined to produce what is deemed a striking representation in the comic style would be a task unpleasing as ungenerous And therefore as they have been equally zealous in their endeavours as happy in the execution of their several characters he wishes them jointly to accept the returns of a grateful heart  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  BYRON  Mr Vernon  Sir HARRY MUFF  Mr Dodd  GENERAL WORRY  Mr Parsons  SPY  Mr Weston  FIRST GARDENER  Mr Bannister  UNDER GARDENERS  Mr Kear  Mr Fawcett  NARCISSA  Mrs Baddely  JENNY  Mrs Wrighten  SCENE A COUNTRY VILLA c  To Mrs GARRICK  MADAM  PERHAPS you were not aware when you were kind enough to shew an early countenance to the following  petite  OPERA that so indulgent an overture entitled it in some measure to your future patronage indeed notwithstanding this circumstance you might probably have escaped the present mortifying situation had not the author conceived that his piece owes no inconsiderable share of its dramatic effect to your taste and judgmenthence arose an appeal to his feelings too powerful to be treated with silent indifference  I mean not however to alarm your delicacy by a recital of those accomplishments which have long rendered you an ornament of the most fashionable circlesnor by recounting those private virtues which stamp you one of the first patterns of domestic felicity facts however agreeable or instructive they might prove to society I decline enumerating in compliment to female diffidence  Having therefore made the acknowledgement I conceive due upon this occasion it is high time for me frankly to confess that vanity had some influence over me when I presumed to think of Mrs GARRICK for the patroness of this my FIRST ESSAY  I remain Madam with great respect Your most obedient and devoted Servant  HEN BATE  Hendon Middlesex  Feb

nature designed as a common blessing to all her creaturesSurely the time will come when I shall regain my liberty and my  Byron  have an opportunity of resuming the tender subject of his passion so cruelly cut off in its infancy  AIR I  Mrs Baddely  Soft FANCY thou truant to me  My summons oh quickly obey  Neglected by BYRON and thee  How heavily passes the day  Thy charms I've mistaken for

he returns  Jen  There's kindness for you madam  Spy  But he charg'd me to tell you he'd have no lolling out of the summerhouse window that looks to the highroadnor no singing for fear you should

Liberty  in order to run away with some scapegrace who'll cut my throat to get in for my fortuneand an abigail crafty enough to debauch the morals of a Lapland virginIt's too much for an invalid of

matter of that Mrs Jenny has a fine stride with her  Gen  Are you sure now Spy that you've seen no suspicious kind of body lurking about the grounds this week past  Spy  Not a soul indeed your honor
