 WINDSORFOREST  To the Right Honourable  GEORGE  Lord  LANSDOWN  By Mr  POPE  Non injussa cano Te nostrae  Vare  Myricae  Te Nemus omne canet nec Phaebo gratior ulla est  Quam sibi quae  Vari  praescripsit Pagina nomen  Virg  LONDON  Printed for  Bernard Lintott  at the  CrossKeys  in  Fleetstreet    WINDSORFOREST  To the Right Honourable  GEORGE  Lord  LANSDOWN  THY Forests  Windsor  and thy green Retreats  At once the Monarch's and the Muse's Seats  Invite my Lays Be present Sylvan Maids  Unlock your Springs and open all your Shades  Granville  commands Your Aid O Muses bring  What Muse for  Granville  can refuse to sing  The Groves of  Eden  vanish'd now so long  Live in Description and look green in Song  These  were my Breast inspir'd with equal Flame  Like them in Beauty should be like in Fame  Here Hills and Vales the Woodland and the Plain  Here Earth and Water seem to strive again  Not  Chaos  like together crush'd and bruis'd  But as the World harmoniously confus'd  Where Order in Variety we see  And where tho' all things differ all agree  Here waving Groves a checquer'd Scene display  And part admit and part exclude the Day  As some coy Nymph her Lover's warm Address  Nor quite indulges nor can quite repress  There interspers'd in Lawns and opening Glades  Thin Trees arise that shun each others Shades  Here in full Light the russet Plains extend  There wrapt in Clouds the blueish Hills ascend  Ev'n the wild Heath displays her Purple Dies  And' midst the Desart fruitful Fields arise  That crown'd with tufted Trees and springing Corn  Like verdant Isles the sable Waste adorn  Let  India  boast her Plants nor envy we  The weeping Amber or the balmy Tree  While by our Oaks the precious Loads are born  And Realms commanded which those Trees adorn  Not proud  Olympus  yields a nobler Sight  Tho' Gods assembled grace his tow'ring Height  Than what more humble Mountains offer here  Where in their Blessings all those Gods appear  See  Pan  with Flocks with Fruits  Pomona  crown'd  Here blushing  Flora  paints th' enamel'd Ground  Here  Ceres  ' Gifts in waving Prospect stand  And nodding tempt the joyful Reaper's Hand  Rich Industry sits smiling on the Plains  And Peace and Plenty tell a STUART reigns  Not thus the Land appear'd in Ages past  A dreary Desart and a gloomy Waste  To Savage Beasts and  The Forest Laws  Savage Laws a Prey  And Kings more furious and severe than they  Who claim'd the Skies dispeopled Air and Floods  The lonely Lords of empty Wilds and Woods  Cities laid waste they storm'd the Dens and Caves  For wiser Brutes were backward to be Slaves  What could be free when lawless Beasts obey'd  And ev'n the Elements a Tyrant sway'd  In vain kind Seasons swell'd the teeming Grain  Soft Show'rs distill'd and Suns grew warm in vain  The Swain with Tears to Beasts his Labour yields  And famish'd dies amidst his ripen'd Fields  No wonder Savages or Subjects slain  Were equal Crimes in a Despotick Reign  Both doom'd alike for sportive Tyrants bled  But Subjects starv'd while Savages were fed  Proud  Nimrod  first the bloody Chace began  A mighty Hunter and his Prey was Man  Our haughty  Norman  boasts that barb'rous Name  And makes his trembling Slaves the Royal Game  The  Alluding to the  New Forest  and the Tyrannies exercis'd there by  William  the First  Fields are ravish'd from th' industrious Swains  From Men their Cities and from Gods their Fanes  The levell'd Towns with Weeds lie cover'd o'er  The hollow Winds thro' naked Temples roar  Round broken Columns clasping Ivy twin'd  O'er Heaps of Ruins stalk'd the stately Hind  The Fox obscene to gaping Tombs retires  And Wolves with Howling fill the sacred Quires  Aw'd by his Nobles by his Commons curst  Th' Oppressor rul'd Tyrannick where he  durst  Stretch'd o'er the Poor and Church his Iron Rod  And treats alike his Vassals and his God  Whom ev'n the  Saxon  spar'd and bloody  Dane  The wanton Victims of his  Sport  remain  But see the Man who spacious Regions gave  A Waste for Beasts himself deny'd a Grave  Stretch'd on the Lawn his  Richard  second Son of  William  the Conqueror  second Hope survey  At once the Chaser and at once the Prey  Lo  Rufus  tugging at the deadly Dart  Bleeds in the Forest like a wounded Hart  Succeeding Monarchs heard the Subjects Cries  Nor saw displeas'd the peaceful Cottage rise  Then gath'ring Flocks on unknown Mountains fed  O'er sandy Wilds were yellow Harvests spread  The Forests wonder'd at th' unusual Grain  And secret Transports touch'd the conscious Swain  Fair  Liberty Britannia  's Goddess rears  Her chearful Head and leads the golden Years  Ye vig'rous Swains while Youth ferments your Blood  And purer Spirits swell the sprightly Flood  Now range the Hills the thickest Woods beset  Wind the shrill Horn or spread the waving Net  When milder Autumn Summer's Heat succeeds  And in the newshorn Field the Partridge feeds  Before his Lord the ready Spaniel bounds  Panting with Hope he tries the furrow'd Grounds  But when the tainted Gales the Game betray  Couch'd close he lyes and meditates the Prey  Secure they trust th' unfaithful Field beset  Till hov'ring o'er 'em sweeps the swelling Net  Thus if small Things we may with great compare  When  Albion  sends her eager Sons to War  Pleas'd in the Gen'ral's Sight the Host lye down  Sudden before some unsuspecting Town  The Young the Old one Instant makes our Prize  And high in Air  Britannia  's Standard flies  See from the Brake the whirring Pheasant springs  And mounts exulting on triumphant Wings  Short is his Joy he feels the fiery Wound  Flutters in Blood and panting beats the Ground  Ah what avail his glossie varying Dyes  His Purple Crest and Scarletcircled Eyes  The vivid Green his shining Plumes unfold  His painted Wings and Breast that flames with Gold  Nor yet when moist  Arcturus  clouds the Sky  The Woods and Fields their pleasing Toils deny  To Plains with wellbreath'd Beagles we repair  And trace the Mazes of the circling Hare  Beasts taught by us their Fellow Beasts pursue  And learn of Man each other to undo  With slaught'ring Guns th' unweary'd Fowler roves  When Frosts have whiten'd all the naked Groves  Where Doves in Flocks the leafless Trees o'ershade  And lonely Woodcocks haunt the watry Glade  He lifts the Tube and levels with his Eye  Strait a short Thunder breaks the frozen Sky  Oft as in Airy Rings they skim the Heath  The clam'rous Plovers feel the Leaden Death  Oft as the mounting Larks their Notes prepare  They fall and leave their little Lives in Air  In genial Spring beneath the quiv'ring Shade  Where cooling Vapours breathe along the Mead  The patient Fisher takes his silent Stand  Intent his Angle trembling in his Hand  With Looks unmov'd he hopes the Scaly Breed  And eyes the dancing Cork and bending Reed  Our plenteous Streams a various Race supply  The brightey'd Perch with Fins of  Tyrian  Dye  The silver Eel in shining Volumes roll'd  The yellow Carp in Scales bedrop'd with Gold  Swift Trouts diversify'd with Crimson Stains  And Pykes the Tyrants of the watry Plains  Now  Cancer  glows with  Phoebus  ' fiery Car  The Youth rush eager to the Sylvan War  Swarm o'er the Lawns the Forest Walks surround  Rowze the fleet Hart and chear the opening Hound  Th' impatient Courser pants in ev'ry Vein  And pawing seems to beat the distant Plain  Hills Vales and Floods appear already crost  And ere he starts a thousand Steps are lost  See the bold Youth strain up the threatning Steep  Rush thro' the Thickets down the Vallies sweep  Hang o'er their Coursers Heads with eager Speed  And Earth rolls back beneath the flying Steed  Let old  Arcadia  boast her spacious Plain  Th' Immortal Huntress and her Virgin Train  Nor envy  Windsor  since thy Shades have seen  As bright a Goddess and as chast a Queen  Whose Care like hers protects the Sylvan Reign  The Earth's fair Light and Empress of the Main  Here as old Bards have sung  Diana  stray'd  Bath'd in the Springs or sought the cooling Shade  Here arm'd with Silver Bows in early Dawn  Her buskin'd Virgins trac'd the Dewy Lawn  Above the rest a rural Nymph was fam'd  Thy Offspring  Thames  the fair  Lodona  nam'd    Lodona  's Fate in long Oblivion cast  The Muse shall sing and what she sings shall last  Scarce could the Goddess from her Nymph be known  But by the Crescent and the golden Zone  She scorn'd the Praise of Beauty and the Care  A Belt her Waste a Fillet binds her Hair  A painted Quiver on her Shoulder sounds  And with her Dart the flying Deer she wounds  It chanc'd as eager of the Chace the Maid  Beyond the Forest's verdant Limits stray'd  Pan  saw and lov'd and furious with Desire  Pursu'd her Flight her Flight increas'd his Fire  Not half so swift the trembling Doves can fly  When the fierce Eagle cleaves the liquid Sky  Not half so swiftly the fierce Eagle moves  When thro' the Clouds he drives the trembling Doves  As from the God with fearful Speed she flew  As did the God with equal Speed pursue  Now fainting sinking pale the Nymph appears  Now close behind his sounding Steps she hears  And now his Shadow reach'd her as she run  His Shadow lengthen'd by the setting Sun  And now his shorter Breath with sultry Air  Pants on her Neck and fans her parting Hair  In vain on Father  Thames  she calls for Aid  Nor could  Diana  help her injur'd Maid  Faint breathless thus she pray'd nor pray'd in vain  " Ah  Cynthia  ahtho' banish'd from thy Train  " Let me O let me to the Shades repair  " My native Shadesthere weep and murmur there  She said and melting as in Tears she lay  In a soft silver Stream dissolv'd away  The silver Stream her Virgin Coldness keeps  For ever murmurs and for ever weeps  Still bears the  The River  Loddon  Name the hapless Virgin bore  And bathes the Forest where she rang'd before  In her chast Current oft the Goddess laves  And with Celestial Tears augments the Waves  Oft in her Glass the musing Shepherd spies  The headlong Mountains and the downward Skies  The watry Landskip of the pendant Woods  And absent Trees that tremble in the Floods  In the clear azure Gleam the Flocks are seen  And floating Forests paint the Waves with Green  Thro' the fair Scene rowl slow the lingring Streams  Then foaming pour along and rush into the  Thames  Thou too great Father of the  British  Floods  With joyful Pride survey'st our lofty Woods  Where tow'ring Oaks their spreading Honours rear  And future Navies on thy Banks appear  Not  Neptune  's self from all his Floods receives  A wealthier Tribute than to thine he gives  No Seas so rich so full no Streams appear  No Lake so gentle and no Spring so clear  Not fabled  Po  more swells the Poets Lays  While thro' the Skies his shining Current strays  Than thine which visits  Windsor  's fam'd Abodes  To grace the Mansion of our earthly Gods  Nor all his Stars a brighter Lustre show  Than the fair Nymphs that gild thy Shore below  Here  Jove  himself subdu'd by Beauty still  Might change  Olympus  for a nobler Hill  Happy the Man whom this bright Court approves  His Sov'reign favours and his Country loves  Happy next him who to these Shades retires  Whom Nature charms and whom the Muse inspires  Whom humbler Joys of homefelt Quiet please  Successive Study Exercise and Ease  He gathers Health from Herbs the Forest yields  And of their fragrant Physick spoils the Fields  With Chymic Art exalts the Min'ral Pow'rs  And draws the Aromatick Souls of Flow'rs  Now marks the Course of rolling Orbs on high  O'er figur'd Worlds now travels with his Eye  Of ancient Writ unlocks the learned Store  Consults the Dead and lives past Ages o'er  Or wandring thoughtful in the silent Wood  Attends the Duties of the Wise and Good  T' observe a Mean be to himself a Friend  To follow Nature and regard his End  Or looks on Heav'n with more than mortal Eyes  Bids his free Soul expatiate in the Skies  Amidst her Kindred Stars familiar roam  Survey the Region and confess her Home  Such was the Life great  Scipio  once admir'd  Thus  Atticus  and  Trumbal  thus retir'd  Ye sacred Nine that all my Soul possess  Whose Raptures fire me and whose Visions bless  Bear me oh bear me to sequester'd Scenes  Of Bow'ry Mazes and surrounding Greens  To  Thames  's Banks which fragrant Breezes fill  Or where ye Muses sport on  Cooper  's Hill  On  Cooper  's Hill eternal Wreaths shall grow  While lasts the Mountain or while  Thames  shall flow  I seem thro' consecrated Walks to rove  And hear soft Musick dye along the Grove  Led by the Sound I roam from Shade to Shade  By Godlike Poets Venerable made  Here his first Lays Majestick  Denham  sung  There the last Numbers flow'd from  Mr  Cowley  died at  Chertsey  on the Borders of the Forest and was from thence convey'd to  Westminster  Cowley  's Tongue  O early lost what Tears the River shed  When the sad Pomp along his Banks was led  His drooping Swans on ev'ry Note expire  And on his Willows hung each Muse's Lyre  Since Fate relentless stop'd their Heav'nly Voice  No more the Forests ring or Groves rejoice  Who now shall charm the Shades where  Cowley  strung  His living Harp and lofty  Denham  sung  But hark the Groves rejoice the Forest rings  Are these reviv'd or is it  Granville  sings  'Tis yours my Lord to bless our soft Retreats  And call the Muses to their ancient Seats  To paint anew the flow'ry Sylvan Scenes  To crown the Forests with Immortal Greens  Make  Windsor  Hills in lofty Numbers rise  And lift her Turrets nearer to the Skies  To sing those Honours you deserve to wear  And add new Lustre to her Silver  Star  Here noble  Henry Howard  E of  Surrey  one of the first Resiners of the  English  Poetry famous in the Time of  Henry  the VIIIth for his Sonnets the Scene of many of which is laid at  Windsor  Surrey  felt the sacred Rage  Surrey  the  Granville  of a former Age  Matchless his Pen victorious was his Lance  Bold in the Lists and graceful in the Dance  In the same Shades the  Cupids  tun'd his Lyre  To the same Notes of Love and soft Desire  Fair  Geraldine  bright Object of his Vow  Then fill'd the Groves as heav'nly  Myra  now  Oh wou'dst thou sing what Heroes  Windsor  bore  What Kings first breath'd upon her winding Shore  Or raise old Warriors whose ador'd Remains  In weeping Vaults her hallow'd Earth contains  With  Edward  III born here  Edward  's Acts adorn the shining Page  Stretch his long Triumphs down thro' ev'ry Age  Draw Kings enchain'd and  Cressi  's glorious Field  The Lillies blazing on the Regal Shield  Then from her Roofs when  Verrio  's Colours fall  And leave inanimate the naked Wall  Still in thy Song shou'd vanquish'd  France  appear  And bleed for ever under  Britain  's Spear  Let softer Strains Illfated  Henry VI  Henry  mourn  And Palms Eternal flourish round his Urn  Here o'er the MartyrKing the Marble weeps  And fast beside him oncefear'd  Edward IV  Edward  sleeps  Whom not th' extended  Albion  could contain  From old  Belerium  to the  German  Main  The Grave unites where ev'n the Great find Rest  And blended lie th' Oppressor and th' Opprest  Make sacred  Charles  's Tomb for ever known  Obscure the Place and uninscrib'd the Stone  Oh Fact accurst What Tears has  Albion  shed  Heav'ns what new Wounds and how her old have bled  She saw her Sons with purple Deaths expire  Her sacred Domes involv'd in rolling Fire  A dreadful Series of Intestine Wars  In glorious Triumphs and dishonest Scars  At length great  ANNA  saidLet Discord cease  She said the World obey'd and all was  Peace  In that blest Moment from his Oozy Bed  Old Father  Thames  advanc'd his rev'rend Head  His Tresses dropt with Dews and o'er the Stream  His shining Horns diffus'd a golden Gleam  Grav'd on his Urn appear'd the Moon that guides  His swelling Waters and alternate Tydes  The figur'd Streams in Waves of Silver roll'd  And on their Banks  Augusta  rose in Gold  Around his Throne the Seaborn Brothers stood  That swell with Tributary Urns his Flood  First the fam'd Authors of his ancient Name  The winding  Isis  and the fruitful  Tame  The  Kennet  swift for silver Eels renown'd  The  Loddon  slow with verdant Alders crown'd  Cole  whose clear Streams his flow'ry Islands lave  And chalky  Wey  that rolls a milky Wave  The blue transparent  Vandalis  appears  The gulphy  Lee  his sedgy Tresses rears  And sullen  Mole  that hides his diving Flood  And silent  Darent  stain'd with  Danish  Blood  High in the midst upon his Urn reclin'd  His Seagreen Mantle waving with the Wind  The God appear'd he turn'd his azure Eyes  Where  Windsor  Domes and pompous Turrets rise  Then bow'd and spoke the Winds forget to roar  And the hush'd Waves glide softly to the Shore  Hail Sacred  Peace  hail longexpected Days  Which  Thames  's Glory to the Stars shall raise  Tho'  Tyber  's Streams immortal  Rome  behold  Tho' foaming  Hermus  swells with Tydes of Gold  From Heav'n it self tho' sev'nfold  Nilus  flows  And Harvests on a hundred Realms bestows  These now no more shall be the Muse's Themes  Lost in my Fame as in the Sea their Streams  Let  Volga  's Banks with Iron Squadrons shine  And Groves of Lances glitter on the  Rhine  Let barb'rous  Ganges  arm a servile Train  Be mine the Blessings of a peaceful Reign  No more my Sons shall dye with  British  Blood  Red  Iber  's Sands or  Ister  's foaming Flood  Safe on my Shore each unmolested Swain  Shall tend the Flocks or reap the bearded Grain  The shady Empire shall retain no Trace  Of War or Blood but in the Sylvan Chace  The Trumpets sleep while chearful Horns are blown  And Arms employ'd on Birds and Beasts alone  Behold th' ascending  Villa's  on my Side  Project long Shadows o'er the Chrystal Tyde  Behold  Augusta  's glitt'ring Spires increase  And Temples rise the beauteous Works of Peace  I see I see where two fair Cities bend  Their ample Bow a new  WhiteHall  ascend  There mighty Nations shall inquire their Doom  The World's great Oracle in Times to come  There Kings shall sue and suppliant States be seen  Once more to bend before a  British  QUEEN  Thy Trees fair  Windsor  now shall leave their Woods  And half thy Forests rush into my Floods  Bear  Britain  's Thunder and her Cross display  To the bright Regions of the rising Day  Tempt Icy Seas where scarce the Waters roll  Where clearer Flames glow round the frozen Pole  Or under Southern Skies exalt their Sails  Led by new Stars and born by spicy Gales  For me the Balm shall bleed and Amber flow  The Coral redden and the Ruby glow  The Pearly Shell its lucid Globe infold  And  Phoebus  warm the ripening Ore to Gold  The Time shall come when free as Seas or Wind  Unbounded  Thames  shall flow for all Mankind  Whole Nations enter with each swelling Tyde  And Oceans join whom they did first divide  Earth's distant Ends our Glory shall behold  And the new World launch forth to seek the Old  Then Ships of uncouth Form shall stem the Tyde  And Feather'd People crowd my wealthy Side  While naked Youth and painted Chiefs admire  Our Speech our Colour and our strange Attire  Oh stretch thy Reign fair  Peace  from Shore to Shore  Till Conquest cease and Slav'ry be no more  Till the freed  Indians  in their native Groves  Reap their own Fruits and woo their Sable Loves  Peru  once more a Race of Kings behold  And other  Mexico's  be roof'd with Gold  Exil'd by Thee from Earth to deepest Hell  In Brazen Bonds shall barb'rous  Discord  dwell  Gigantick  Pride  pale  Terror  gloomy  Care  And mad  Ambition  shall attend her there  There purple  Vengeance  bath'd in Gore retires  Her Weapons blunted and extinct her Fires  There hateful  Envy  her own Snakes shall feel  And  Persecution  mourn her broken Wheel  There  Faction  roars  Rebellion  bites her Chain  And gasping Furies thirst for Blood in vain  Here cease thy Flight nor with unhallow'd Lays  Touch the fair Fame of  Albion  's Golden Days  The Thoughts of Gods let  Granville  's Verse recite  And bring the Scenes of opening Fate to Light  My humble Muse in unambitious Strains  Paints the green Forests and the flow'ry Plains  Where Peace descending bids her Olives spring  And scatters Blessings from her Dovelike Wing  Ev'n I more sweetly pass my careless Days  Pleas'd in the silent Shade with empty Praise  Enough for me that to the listning Swains  First in these Fields I sung the Sylvan Strains  FINIS
