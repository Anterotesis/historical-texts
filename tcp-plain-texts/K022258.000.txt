 A SHORT TRACT CONCERNING THE DOCTRINE OF  Nullum Tempus occur∣rit Regi  SHEWING The particular Cases to which it is applicable AND That it cannot according to LAW be effectual FOR THE Recovery of Manors Lands or Tenements Alienated from the Crown  LONDON PRINTED IN THE YEAR MDCCLXXIX  Extract of a Letter from the Author of the following Tract to dated the th of May which is prefixed to the  MS  Copy of the Tract in the Hands of the Editor    As I have lately heard that it is now dis∣puted whether or not  you  ought to be excluded from the benefit of the late  Nullum tempus act for quieting the possessions of the subject  I have taken the liberty to inclose for your perusal a short tract on the general doctrine of  Nullum tempus occurrit regi  How far the same may be applicable to the point in contest between  you  and the trea∣suryboard  I cannot pretend to judge because my information concerning that affair arises merely from common report so that of course I must pro∣fess myself a stranger to the particular circumstances of the case Neverthe∣less as I happened in the course of my reading the other day to light up∣on a passage in Bracton which to me seemed capable of affording a clear explanation of the  Nullum tempus doc∣trine  I thought it a duty incumbent on me to send  you  my thoughts upon it It may indeed be said that Bracton is in the hands of every law∣yer and that I ought to have known that the learned gentlemen of the law employed by  you  are already ap∣prized of the passage to which I refer as they must certainly at some time or other have read it nevertheless there is sufficient reason for me to  pre∣sume  that they have entirely  overlooked or forgot it in the present case  and that even the whole legislature have also either forgot it or else are entirely ig∣norant of it because the late act of parliament which was made expressly to guard against the  mistaken doctrine of Nullum tempus  must otherwise  ap∣pear absurd and superfluous  I think it necessary to presume thus much by way of excuse for having presumed to write to  you  about business which does not in the least concern me as it might otherwise be deemed impertinent in me to sup∣pose that  you  have not already the most learned advice that can be procu∣red If the little tract contains any hints that are thought capable of being enforced to your advantage it will give me real pleasure for indeed I have no greater happiness than that of being  serviceable when it lies in my power to any man whatever whether friend or stranger    Signed "GRANVILLE SHARP"  PREFACE  WHEN an author pretends to write a treatise on any particular subject he ought to have leisure sufficient to examine and thoroughly consider every thing that has an intimate connex∣ion with it but as the Writer of this has no such leisure it is ne∣cessary for him to declare that he professes no other knowledge of the subject in question than what has occurred to him occa∣sionally in consulting the lawbooks on other points and there∣fore  he offers this little Tract to his readers not as a complete and regular system but rather as a groundwork for future enqui∣ries upon the subject by Writers who are blessed with more leisure and abilities for such researches than himself and who may perhaps be hereby induced either to build upon the same founda∣tion or to establish a better in its room  A SHORT TRACT CONCERNING THE Doctrine of  Nullum Tempus occurrit Regi  c  PART I  THE doctrine of  Nullum Tempus occurrit Regi  if admitted in an unlimited and general sense is capable of being wrested to the most arbitrary purposes and may seem to au∣thorize the most dangerous and oppres∣sive pretensions and claims on the pro∣perty of the subject  As  a general doctrine  therefore it is  unreasonable  and consequently incon∣sistent with the fundamental principles  of the  common law  for which reason I never could esteem the  Nullum Tempus  doctrine as  a maxim  of the common law and I have since found that my opinion of it was in some degree right and that the doctrine is so far from being  a general maxim  that it ought never to be menti∣oned without its peculiar  exceptions  lest it should do injury by being applied to improper cases and be mistaken for  a maxim  to the perversion of justice for the true and proper  maxims  of the com∣mon law demand the utmost deference when they are cited their authority be∣ing unquestionable because  Contra negantem principia  vel maxima  non est disputandum  Co Lit Doc∣tor Student  c  c p  This maxim may indeed seem appli∣cable to myself for denying that the authority and weight of  a maxim  is due to the doctrine of  Nullum Tempus c  But I hope to be able in the course of  this work to obviate any such imputa∣tion and to prove  that it really is not a general maxim  In order to set this point in a clear light it will be necessary first of all to take a short view of those par∣ticular  rights of the crown  which  in law  are justly esteemed  unalienable  and which I apprehend to be as follows  The king is invested by his office with a kind of  limited property  in the per∣sons of all his  free subjects  by which he is enabled and indeed bound in duty to claim and  free  them whenever their persons are unlawfully seized imprison∣ed or otherwise detained at home or a∣broad under pretence of right of ser∣vice whereby their  persons  are claimed as  private property  acquired by purchase custom or any other mode of acquisi∣tion  Query How far may this hold good since the ma∣king of the Habeas Corpus act which supposes that a man may be transported against his will if he has sign∣ed a written contract Sect This section howe∣ver gives no authority for such a forcible transporta∣tion it only informs us that the act does NOT  "extend to give benefit" in such case  but the common law we may presume will or ought to  "give benefit"  in this as in every other case of  violence  and  wrong  because  "Lex semper dabit remedium"  and I have al∣ready shewn that the right of the Crown is  unalienable  in this kind  of property  for the maintainance of  freedom  whatsoever For no claims of this  kind upon a  freeman  are to be favour∣ed in law or can possibly be accounted valid because the maxim assures us that  "Liber homo"  is  "res quasi sacra" "which may not be sold"  Item quasi res sacra ut  liber homo  qui vendi non potest cùm  libertas  non recipiat aestimationem  c  Bracton lib p  so that there can be no just claim of property  in the person of a freeman  except the  official right  and  claim of property  vested in the king and as this is  limited  by the laws for the benefit and  freedom of the subject  it is for that very reason  unalienable from the crown  Other  unalienable rights of the Crown  are those which form the public revenue and belong to the king's exchequer all which are included by this author in the term  "Res fiscalis"  Et est res quasi sacra  Res fiscalis  quae dari non potest nec vendi nec ad alium transferri a principe vel a rege regnante  and which he also esteems  "res quasi sacra"  To this rule about  Res fiscalis  there are some ne∣cessary exceptions which will hereafter be mentioned  There are also several other rights which are inherent in the Crown  for the public good  and cannot therefore be dis∣posed of or alienated viz such as  Peace Justice  c  et quae faciunt ipsam coronam et communem utilitatem re∣spiciunt sicut est  Pax  et  Justitia  c  To all such things we may safely apply the doctrine of  Nullum tempus occurrit regi  The same is likewise applica∣ble to a few other things even of an inferior or second class I mean such as  are nevertheless so far  alienable  that they may lawfully without damage to the king or his subjects be transferred  for a time  to other persons  Sunt et aliae res quae pertinent ad coronam propter privile∣gium regis et ita communem non re∣spiciunt utilitatem quin dari possunt et ad alium transferri quia si transfe∣rantur translatio nulli erit damnosa nec ipsi regi sive principi c  The things ranked in this class of  Royal Pro∣perty  are  seawrecks treasures found great fish  as  whales sturgeons  and other  royal fish  And whosoever pretends to have a right to enjoy the profits arising from these particular things must be a∣ble to produce a special  warrant  for that purpose because  prescription  even of a very long time is not sufficient to justify the pretension  Diuturnitas enim tem∣poris  in hoc casu  injuriam  non minuit sed auget nec in primo casu  NEC IN ISTO CURRIT TEMPUS CONTRA REGEM  nec incumbit ei probatio quia ad ip∣sum pertineant cum constare debeat singulis quod hujusmodi de jure gen∣tium pertineant ad coronam  But with respect to things of a third class as  crownmanors lands tenements  c the case is widely different for the doctrine of  Nullum tempus  c affects them not at all And I am astonished that so many gentlemen learned in the law whose attention has lately been em∣ployed upon this point should have thought it necessary to provide by a spe∣cial act of parliament against this doc∣trine when  the common law of England  that ought always to be preferred  When common law and statute law concur the common law shall be preferred  Co  has already sufficiently guarded us against the tyrannical construction of the phrase which like a mere bugbear is formi∣dable only whilst misunderstood though it has raised an epidemical panic of which  the late act is a proof  Sunt etiam  aliae res  quae pertinent ad coronam quae  non sunt ita sacrae  quin transfer∣ri possunt sicut sunt FUNDI TERRAE  et  TENEMENTA  et  HUJUSMODI per quos corona regis roboratur et in qui∣bus CURRIT TEMPUS CONTRA RE∣GEM  sicut contra quamlibet privatam personam  Thus we are assured by the authority of an ancient and unexceptionable writer that  crownlands  are exactly upon  the same footing  as  private freeholds  with respect to  time  or  prescription  which is the ve∣ry reverse of the  Nullum tempus  doctrine lately adopted by the Treasury  Now it is a maxim in law that a quiet and uninterrupted  possession  for sixty years creates a proper title  Possessio pacifica  POUR ANNS  facit jus  Prin Leg et Aeq p See also Jenk cent And therefore as we have be∣fore shewn that  Crown manors lands  and  tenements  are exactly upon the same footing with respect to  time  or prescription  as private freeholds  we must necessa∣rily conclude that the king entirely loses his title to alienated lands if there are better proofs of such a  peaceable possession  on the one side than of  a continued claim  on the other in which case the lands must become wholly and entirely the property of the possessor And even when  alien∣ated crown lands  are claimed within any shorter term than sixty years the king  may not seize  for it is a maxim  That the  king can disseize no man  nor be disseized  Doctor Student  Item pro maximo habetur in legibus Angliae quod  nullus potest dominum regem disseisire  NEC DOMI∣NUS REX ALIQUEM DISSEISIRE POTERIT ita quod liberum tenementum per talem disseisinam transfere∣tur de rege ad alium NEC E CONTRA  Chap  and even though the king  cannot be disseized  yet this is not to be construed so as to annul that interest which private persons acquire  by time  in the possession of alie∣nated  lands for that is sufficiently esta∣blished by an act of Edw III c which ordains with respect to  lands and tenements holden of the king in chief and  ALIENED WITHOUT LICENCE  that the  king shall  NOT HOLD THEM AS FORFEIT  in such case but    there shall be a reasonable fine taken in Chancery by  DUE PROCESS  Here is no limited time for possession so that the act is as ef∣ficacious for those who have been  in pos∣session only    years  as for those who have held  times    years  as above See also Edw III c Jac c Hen VI c § and Eliz c  By the two last mentioned acts a peace∣able and quiet possession  for    years  creates a right that will justify "  keeping possession  WITH FORCE" but as the king is not ex∣pressly named I conceive that so short a time doth not bar his title to any  reason∣able fines  not prohibited by Char II  c  See sect and particularly the latter  Provided always and be it enacted that any thing herein contained shall not take away nor be con∣strued to take away  any fines for alienation  due by particular customs of particular manors and places  other  than fines for alienations of lands or tenements holden immediately of the king in  capite  because it is a maxim that  the king is not bound by statute law unless expressly named  What hath hitherto been advanced I hope will be thought sufficient to esta∣blish the  absolute property  of  all persons  who shall be able to prove  a peaceable pos∣session of alienated crownlands unclaimed for    years  and also that those persons who have held  alienated crownlands for more than  three  years unclaimed  have a right  to continue in possession  on paying a  reason∣able fine  and consequently that  the doc∣trine of Nullum tempus  c is by no means  effectual  for the recovery of  ma∣nors lands  or  tenements alienated from the crown  And I trust that my candid  readers will acknowledge and hold fast this my opinion until they see  more au∣thentic vouchers  produced in support of the contrary doctrine  Signed GRANVILLE SHARP  PART II Concerning some Precautions and Conditions necessary to be ob∣served in the granting of Crown Lands Tenements  c  THE crown is limited as well in the mode of  granting  as in the con∣ditions to  be granted  insomuch that when any grant or lease is made  contrary to the rules prescribed by law  the same is there∣by rendered  null and void  I shall not pretend to speak of all the particular pre∣cautions and conditions necessary to be observed on these occasions but only some few of the most essential which I apprehend have not been so much re∣garded  of late  as they ought  The legislature hath agreed and laid it down as a rule that all the ancient and  military tenures of lands and  even  SOCCAGE IN CAPITE  of the king and the consequents upon the same have been much more burthensome grievous and  PREJUDICIAL  to the kingdom than they have been  BENEFICIAL  to the king  See Preamble to Cha II cap For this just reason  founded on experi∣ence  the king hath ever since been  re∣strained by the law  from granting any part of his dominions upon such conditions  I have indeed heard of a foreign island being granted to a noble lord upon some such  antiquated conditions  whereby he is said to be established as  lord para∣mount  with a peculiar unconstitutional authority but this I am willing to pre∣sume is merely report and even if it were true the grant would be innocent enough because it is  null and void in it∣self  as the king has had no right since  Cha II to make a grant  on any other tenure than that of free and common soc∣cage  Sect  And be it farther enacted  c  That all tenures hereafter to be created by the king's ma∣jesty his heirs or successors upon any gifts or grants of any manors lands tenements or hereditaments of any estate of inheritance at the common law shall be in  free and common socage  and shall be ad∣judged to be in  free and common socage only  and not by knights service or in capite and shall be discharged of all wardship  c  any law statute or reser∣vation to the contrary thereof in any wise notwith∣standing  The king is also bound to have respect to  former grants  because even in cases when the king hath grant∣ed  during pleasure  a second grant  not mentioning the former shall be void    Hen VIII c  Now in order to set forth more clear∣ly some  other  circumstances wherein the crown is  limited  in the mode of grant∣ing and in the conditions to be granted I shall beg leave to  suppose  a case  Suppose  a crafty and litigious person makes interest with the  lordtreasurer  or  the commissioners of the treasury  for a grant of alienated crownlands on condition that he shall  at his own expence  prove and establish  the right of the crown and recover the lands from the present possessor  Let us also  suppose  a lordtreasurer or commissioners of the treasury  so regard∣less of the necessary and legal precautions against abuses in granting crownlands  that they approve the clandestine offer and procure  a grant  from their royal mas∣ter agreeable to the wishes of the pro∣poser  But what will such an adventurer gain by his parchments whilst the king's courts are worthy to be esteemed  courts of justice and law  Be pleased to observe that my  suppositions  are now at a stand They extend no farther than the  imagi∣nary case  already laid down For I am not  to suppose  or  conceive  that any learn∣ed persons who preside in the king's courts are subject to venal  timeserving  or the factious spirit of party influence which is the source of the most dange∣rous  partiality  because  partiality  is en∣tirely inconsistent with the high character of  judges  and must necessarily make shipwreck of their souls  For a  partial judge  cannot truly be said to  "have the fear of God before his eyes"  and as this is the  first principle  which the common law of England requires and deems absolutely necessary in all ranks of the community but more particularly in  judges  I am bound in Christian cha∣rity not to suspect such  a legal incapacity  in any of them until I am convinced by experience to the contrary  For this reason I have not attempted by declamation and farfetched argu∣ments to establish my opinion nor do I rely on the interest and number of my friends to make it pass current neither do I demand favour of my readers as being a friend to administration but  I have founded my opinion merely  on the authority of law  and whilst our judges as well as juries are susceptible of that  just and indispensible fear  before mentioned and are in the least  mindful of the solemn account which they themselves must one day give  so long shall I presume that our courts are  impartial  and that they will carefully and conscientiously weigh and determine every case that is laid be∣fore them according  to the known laws of the land  and consequently that they would reject with disdain the claim of  my supposed adventurer  if his pretensions to the alienated lands in question had no better foundation than  such a grant  as I have  supposed  The Courts would in∣form the litigious adventurer that his grant is of no signification and cannot convey to him the least right in the alie∣nated lands because the Crown is bound to prove and establish its own right in all manors lands  c  before  it can grant  them to any person whatever  for both the lordchancellor and the lordtreasurer and consequently the commissioners of the treasury are absolutely restrained by an act of parliament Hen VI c  Hen VI c xvi  To eschew the dolours grievances and disherisons which daily do happen to many of the king's liegepeople by the escheators for that they take enquests to inquire before them as well by virtue of the king's writs as of their offi∣ces favourably  and not duly  by people not impan∣nelled nor returned to them by the sheriffs of the counties and more often for their  private gain  and for  the disherison of the king's liegepeople than for the profit of the same our lord the king  and also for that the lands and tenements of many of the king's liegepeople be seized into the king's hands upon such enquests  or let  to ferm by the chancellor or treasurer  before such enquests be returned  in the chancery our lord the king hath ordained  c  that no escheator or com∣missioner take in any wise  any enquest to enquire  but of people  returned and impanelled by the sheriff▪  in the county within which he is escheator or commissioner And if any escheator or commissioner take  enquests  of people which be not  impanelled  c that he incur the penalty of l c And that no lands nor tenements seised into the hand of our lord the king upon such enquests taken before the escheators or commissioners be not in any wise  let  nor  granted to ferm by the chancel∣lor or treasurer of England  or any other the king's  offi∣cer  until the same  enquests  and  verdicts  be fully return∣ed  in the chancery  or in the exchequer but all such lands c shall intirely and continually remain  in the hands of our lord the king  until the said enquests and verdicts be returned c  See also Ed III c to which this act refers for the form of letting  from letting or granting the  king's lands  to farm  until  lawful enquests  and  verdicts  that is from  good towns  and  of good people  Ed III c or  a jury of twelve sufficient men  Hen VIII c have been taken thereupon and  be fully returned  in the Chancery or in the Exchequer but all such lands and tenements shall entirely and continu∣ally remain in the hands of our lord the king until the said enquests and ver∣dicts be returned  c  And when the persons  grieved by the same en∣quests or putting out of their lands and tenements  come into the Chancery and proffer themselves to traverse the said enquests and then offer to take the same lands or tenements to ferm And if they so do that then the same lands  c  be committed  to them if they shew good evidence c  So that there is  no possibility for the crown to make  a valid grant  upon the conditions before de∣scribed  viz  the establishing of the Crown's right at the expence of the grantee  And another act was made in the eighteenth year of the same reign cap expressly as a remedy to prevent such  subtle and designing persons  from suing  to obtain such gifts and grants and ferms by the king's letters patents before any inquisition  as above  or title found for the king of the same pretending such gifts and grants not comprised and remedied by the said statute c  And if any letters patents be made to the contrary they shall BE VOID AND HOLDEN FOR NONE  So that our adventu∣rer's claim founded on  a grant  made  pre∣vious to these necessary steps  is absolutely  null and void of itself  And the very conditions of it viz that of establishing the right of the crown at the grantee's own expence would afford substantial proof without any farther examination  that the crown had neglected all these  legal precautions  which are absolutely necessary for the foundation and existence of every grant and consequently such a condition is of itself sufficient to ren∣der any grant a  mere nullity  I must likewise observe that the crown or its ministers have no right to grant lands on any other terms or condi∣tions whatsoever besides those which are prescribed by law  utterly void and of none effect  says the st Stat of queen Anne sect  unless such  GRANT LEASE  c be made for some term or es∣tate not exceeding one and thirty years or three lives or for some term of years deter∣minable upon one two or three lives and unless such grant c be made to com∣mence from the date or making thereof  which is impossible in the case that I have supposed where the right is afterwards to be established by a contest at lawThere are also  other conditions  which are absolutely necessary a reservation must be made of  the ancient and most usual rent or more or such rent as hath been reserved yield∣ed and paid for the greater part of twenty years before the making of the grant or a reserved rent not under the third part  of the clear yearly value  And whatever grant is made since the first of queen Anne otherwise than according to the tenure and meaning of the said act is  absolutely null and void  It would be in vain for a  Treasuryboard  to alledge in such a case that they abated their le∣gal conditions in consideration of the grantee being bound to prosecute and establish at his own expence  the right of the crown  an impartial court such as I have described would freely declare that the crown is not empowered to change the above  prescribed conditions  on any pretence whatsoever being absolute∣ly  limited  and bound by this Statute of st Anne which declares sect  that all gifts grants c of manors c  or any part thereof contrary to the pro∣visions of this act or any of them shall  BE NULL AND VOID  without any inqui∣sition scire facias or other proceeding to determine or make void the same  But the most material thing to be con∣sidered by a lord chancellor a lord trea∣surer or a treasuryboard before they presume to reclaim  alienated lands c  is what I first of all touched upon viz whether the present possessors of lands c have enjoyed a  quiet possession of sixty years  because that creates a good title "FACIT JUS" as I have already proved and such great officers ought to be aware that  Rescriptum principis contra  JUS  non valet  so that they would betray the honour of their royal master if they were to endeavour to pro∣cure his assent to grants of land c which by  time and possession  are thus to∣tally  and irrecoverably alienated  for  Do∣natio principis intelligitur  SINE PREJU∣DICIO  TERTII  Davis And  One should be  JUST  before he is  GENE∣ROUS  The points of law and opinions which I have here laid down may perhaps be capable of perversion for indeed the  plainest truths  may be wrested and  per∣verted  by long sophistical and deceit∣ful argumentsbut let my opponents submit their objections to writing as I have done and collate them side by side with mine and it will be impossible for the most subtle prevarication to set aside so many plain and intelligible laws which acquire a collective force by being thus produced together and even if we could suppose an inclination or partiality in any of the king's justices to favour and confirm  every act of administration whatsoever  be it  right or wrong  and among the rest such AN ILLEGAL ACT OF THE TREA∣SURY LORDS as I have here stated in this supposed grant yet even the most  partial  of them would find themselves exposed to great difficulty shame and danger by attempting to define away the true meaning of so many positive laws in order to  establish  such  an injustice  for the private opinions of the king's justices ought to have  no weight  neither their  will  and  inclination  except when clearly supported  by law  because they are not allowed  an arbitrary or wilful discretion  Also discretion as it is well described is  scire per legem quid sit justum  Co  but merely  a legal discretion  which is  "discernere per legem quod sit justum"    For  discretion  is a science or understand∣ing to discern between  falsity  and  truth  between  right  and  wrong  between  sha∣dows  and  substance  between  equity  and  colourable glosses  and  pretences  and not to do according to their  wills and private affections  for as one faith  Talis dis∣cretio discretionem confundit  Co If these salutary laws and un∣alterable  maxims have been infringed by any  great officer of the present times  through  misinformation  or for want of duly considering the point in question let them but acknowledge their error together with a sincere intention to make what reparation may lie in their power and they will easily regain that public confi∣dence and esteem which they have for∣feited by their mistakes for sure I am with sir Edw Cook  that no wise or truehearted  Englishman  that hath been  persuaded  before he was  instructed  will refuse to be  instructed  in the truth which  he may see with his own eyes  lest he should be  dissuaded  from error wherewith blindfold he hath been deceived for  miserable is his case and worthy of pity that hath been  PER∣SUADED  before he was  INSTRUCTED  and now will refuse to be  INSTRUCTED  because he will not be  PERSUADED  But howsoever applicable the latter part  of this quotation may be to any of his majesty's  late  or  present ministers  yet am I thoroughly persuaded that it will never  be justly  said of himself  As a man he is indeed liable to be im∣posed on and may perhaps  be persuaded  to give his assent to some improper things through the insinuation of mere  worldly politicians  that the same are absolutely NECESSARY and that he must submit to tread in the beaten tract of  statepolicy  howsoever  corrupt  to avoid the danger of greater evils  The NECESSITY of doing  evil  to avoid  a greater evil  is a doctrine too generally adopted by  worldly  poli∣ticians and perfectly accords with the ancient  iniquitous  proposition  "Let us do  EVIL  that  GOOD  may come"  But the unhappy state of those wretched politicians who give such pernicious counsel is immediately ad∣ded  whose damnation is just  Rom iii  If he ever has yielded to such

might safely and with pro∣priety avoid it but the  rectitude of his in∣tentions  I am convinced will never  justly  be called in question  That he is a good christian and  sin∣cerely wishes to promote the general good of his people  I have not the least doubt and therefore if any man hath  been inju∣red  by such  an illegal grant  as I have de∣scribed let him find some means of sta∣ting the merits of his case in a proper and respectful manner to our gracious sove∣reign and I will FORFEIT MY LIFE  if he does not find redress  MY CONFIDENCE  N B This tract is dated in May  is not without foundation I had the honour to stand in his royal presence when he called  God and man  to witness in the most solemn and affecting manner that can be described that he would  rule according to the laws  From that time to this I have enter∣tained the highest personal esteem and respect for him and have really more hopes of the reestablishment of public peace and content from the  sincerity and good heart  as I conceive  of that one man  than from the most earnest endeavours of all the other honest and loyal people of England who of themselves without their royal master at their head are by far too few and weak to resist the immense tide of  venality and corruption  which has almost totally overflowed this once happy island  Take away the wicked from before the king and his throne shall  be established in righteousness  Prov xxv  Signed GRANVILLE SHARP  THE END
