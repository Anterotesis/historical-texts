 THE PRODIGAL  A DRAMATIC PIECE  AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL  IN THE HAYMARKET  DECEMBER▪  "To wake the soul by tender strokes of art  "To raise the genius and to mend the heart  "To make mankind in conscious virtue bold  "Live o'er each scene and be what they behold  "For this the Tragic Muse first trod the stage  "Commanding tears to stream thro' every age"  Pope's  Prologue  to Addison's CATO  LONDON  PRINTED FOR T ARROWSMITH MIDDLEROW HOLBORN AND SOLD BY B CROSBY STATIONERS COURT    PRICE ONE SHILLING  ADVERTISEMENT  THE dinnerhour of persons of fashion having almost jostled the supperhour of our an∣cestors out of its place the first act of a play is either very thinly attended or considerably inter∣rupted by the clattering of boxdoors and seats while the house is filling for which reason it has been thought necessary of late years at the HayMarket Theatre to perform a short piece previous to that which is meant as the principal attraction those already upon the acting list having been some time in use Mr Colman then junior desi∣red me to point out such as might occur suitable to the purpose I mentioned  The Fatal Extrava∣gance  written by Joseph Mitchell  Vide  BIOGRA∣PHIA DRAMATICA  V II P  which on looking over it he was pleased to approve of ex∣cepting that he thought the catastrophe too tragick for a petitepiece I therefore made such altera∣tions in it as he conceived to be wanting in doing which I availed myself of his very judicious ad∣vice and adopted several energetick expressions  dropt during the rehearsals from his mouth  pen  The concluding lines  "Hence may the Gamester learn ere yet too late" c  are entirely Mr Colman's  I wish I could particularize every word suggest∣ed by him for tho' I have not as Ben Jonson to our loss tooscrupulously did as it is supposed by Shakspeare  "rather chosen to put weaker and no doubt lesse pleasing of mine own"  yet would I not  "defraud so happy a Genius of his right by my lothed usurpation"  See Jonson's Address  "To the Readers"  prefixed to the to edit of his  "Sejanus"    The piece as altered and called  The Prodigal  has been excellently performed twelve times at Mr Colman's Theatre with distinguished appro∣bation some of the passages now printed were omitted in the reprefentation but what would have been thought tedious and heavy on the stage it is hoped will not be found so in the closet  October  F G WALDRON  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  BELLMOUR Mr Barrymore  COURTNEY Mr Aickin  BARGRAVE Mr Benson  LOUISA Mrs Powell  SCENE Bellmour's House  TIME that of the Representation  THE PRODIGAL  A DRAMATIC PIECE  ACT I SCENE  A Saloon  Enter  LOUISA  and  COURTNEY  LOUISA  'TWAS kind this speed of your returnBut tell me  What success had you was my father mov'd  Methinks I read your news in your sad visage  And my heart trembles with prophetic fears  COURTNEY  'Twas as I judg'd 't would beHis own wants press him  He sinks beneath your husband's wasteful life  Those boundless dicings and voluptuous riots  Which have at once dissolv'd a wealth so vast  That Pity scarce vouchsafes to heed his sufferings  LOUISA  But his late conduct proves my Bellmour chang'd  Misfortunes have instructed him to think  And thought has captiv'd every madding passion  COURTNEY  Yet early vice by custom long indulg'd  Leaves such impression of habitual ill  As finds no cure but from severe remorse  And Time's slow working  LOUISA  Nay name not Bellmour's vice  He has no vicehis every power is lost  Even had he taste for folliespoor and despis'd  The slaves for whose curs'd sakes he stands re∣proach'd  Now shun his converse Villains who betray'd  Start when they meet him Poverty like his  Spreads a contagion round it and mankind  Fly frighted from him What will become of us  Did you lay open our incumbent ruin  Urg'd you my father strongly Want's cold hand  Creeps o'er us and 'tis now no time for counsel  COURTNEY  I told him all and mov'd his utmost pity  Still as he set to view your husband's failings  I urg'd his virtues and bore down the balance  I prais'd his wit his courage his humanity  His fine frank spirit and his generous nature  He answer'd and I firmly think with truth  What he has done already weighs him down  His struggling will to save you has undone him  And Bellmour's self would there beg aid in vain  LOUISA  O he was never born to be a beggar  Heav'n is too kind to goodness to forsake him  He whom soft Pity melts at others' misery  Deserves himself to live exempt from woe  Bellmour could ne'er behold a stranger wretched  But he partook his pain 'till he could ease it  How then will he support the weeping anguish  Of three poor children all undone by him  COURTNEY  His good and ill so chequer out his nature  That which excels is doubtful Nobly will'd  His pitying heart flows out in generous purposes  But wanting power to stem the tide of pleasure  Irresolute he drives and floats to ruin  Men must be rigid and severe in virtue  Serious and noble aims distinguish reason  To live for luxury is not to live  The man of pleasure dreams away his days  And dies to be forgotten Bellmour's soul  Had contemplation bent it to a bias  Had given a point to Fame's proud pinnacle  And purpled o'er his name with deathless glory  Now it lies lost in dustcontemn'd despis'd  LOUISA  Oh I shall tremble to behold his face  His ruin'd family hangs on his heart  His helpless children's future fate distracts him  For the oncelively Bellmour smiles no more  Silent he walks or stands with folded arms  And still looks down as if his soul were earth  If e'er by chance his lifted eyes meet mine  The starting tears glare dreadfully upon me  And quivering struggle to flow loose in sorrow  Then sighs suppress'd by force strive hard for vent  And heave and swell like earthquakes in his bosom  Groaning at length he breaks in whirlwind from me  Torn by ten thousand pangs raves reddens starts  And frights me with a dreadful burst of passions  COURTNEY  Poor suffering innocent I would 'twere mine  To screen you from the storm that's gath'ring round  But I unbless'd with power can only wish  And hope some chance will save you from de∣struction  LOUISA  O uncle what remains for Hope to snatch at  Of all the wide estate that late was ours  But this poor house is left usthis too totters  Soon Ruin with his palsied hand will seize  This ancient pile and shake it into dust  Not thrice the worth of all that now is ours  Will save poor Woodly from that fatal bond  He sign'd to save my BellmourAll our hope  Was in your friendly journey to my father  Woodly must sink and Bellmour cannot bear it  Bellmour will never live to sink a friend  Look yonder where in pensive grief he walks  Unhoping and disconsolate  COURTNEY  Poor Bellmour  How chang'd from that wild gay joyful reveller  Which all his friends have known him still ex∣treme  Enter  BELLMOUR  melancholy  LOUISA  My lifemy Bellmourwound not thus my soul  I have more woes to bear that are my own  Than my strength matches add not thou thy sorrow  That would o'erwhelm me quite  BELLMOUR  I pray forgive me  Prison'd in thought I could not look about me  And my soul miss'd thy comfortI was con∣fidering  LOUISA  What sad reflection held you  BELLMOUR  Which of my boys  Some few years hence when I'm dissolv'd in death  Will act the beggar bestrun barefoot fastest  And with most dexterous shrug play tricks for charity  LOUISA  O for heav'n's sake forbear by starts like this  To image horrors Nature shrinks at thought of  BELLMOUR  Why my Louisa 'tis a wretch's duty  To learn to bear his miseryto know it  To use ourselves to scorn it is the way  To make it easy to usYet I'm to blame  Thou had'st no share in any guilt of mine  I ought alone to suffer'Twas too cruel  'Twas ev'n unmanly to afflict thy innocence  COURTNEY  Oh Sir you sooth the grief you shou'd resist  Mean spirits only buckle under woe  It is the great man's pride to combat fortune  And rise against oppression  BELLMOUR  Sir 'tis true  And I remember you have oft advis'd it  While I had power to try my virtue's proof  A man may die unhelp'd but must not hope  To conquer without armsTalking of help  Will your good Brother aid meSpeaking silence  How could I hope it from him  COURTNEY  Yet despair not  A time may come when ev'n your woes shall prove  To suffer well's the noblest way to conquest  On a smooth Sea the Sailor shews no skill  But he displays it all in Hurricanes  BELLMOUR  He would not sure neglect to save his daughter  Had he the power still left him yet friends some∣times  Are more than fathersI had a friend in Woodly  Once he was happywhat he shall be hereafter  He owes to thriftless Bellmour Perish the name  To what a stinging death is he reserv'd  Who leaves a good man wretched whom he made so  Sir it would ease me of a galling pain  Would you dispel this unavailing hope  I cherish'd late relying on my father  From Woodly's breast'Twere sin to nourish it  Since 'tis unstablehe must know it soon  Let it be told by any tongue but Bellmour's  COURTNEY  I'll visit him this instantDo you meanwhile  To Louisa  Calmly seek comfort from a firm belief  That heav'n befriends your virtues and will save you  Exit  BELLMOUR  Louisa  With violent emotion  LOUISA  Alas what mean you to distract me thus  With your wild startings  BELLMOUR  Nay but mark me well  Want's the damnation of a living sinner  What have I liv'd for if I die a beggar  How excellent art thou not to have scorn'd me  Good heav'n that reason should give madness way  'Till man finds musick in a rattling dicebox  And has contracted thrice three thousand Acres  To the curs'd compass of a narrow table  With what a thoughtless rapture have I shook 'em  Hung o'er the throw and hurl'd out my posterity  Slaves thieves or beggarsTear me limb from limb  Some pitying torturer To die at once  Were comfort ev'n in agonybut I shall be  Whole ages after death in dyingVillains  Dull pityless insulting purseproud villains  Will point at some poor ragged child of mine  And say " There's pride and name there's Bell∣mour's honour "  " There's the blest remnant of a boasted family "  Curse the keen thought it pours all hell upon me  LOUISA  Still wilt thou thus snatch at Despair's wild shadows  I've heard the manly soul can smile at anguish  Woman's weak mind may bend beneath adversity  But Bellmour's brow methinks should wear a Majesty  And make affliction awful  BELLMOUR  Away with Counsel  I cannot hear thee thy moving air thy wisdom  That lovely softness which bewitches round thee  Each charm which has a thousand times ap∣peas'd me  Now makes me mad like oil pour'd out on flame  I tower in blaze and burn with tenfold fierceness  Thy every word is death each look thou giv'st me  Shoots poison'd arrows thro' my bleeding con∣science  Think'st thou I am so mean so lost a wretch  That my own misery stings me cruel woman  What earthly ill can Bellmour stoop to fear  Which hurts but Bellmour 'tis true indeed thy fate  I have not learn'd to bearthere Grief unmans me  Thine and thy helpless Infants' woes rise to me  Oh I have wrong'd thee  LOUISA  'Tis wronging me to say it  Reenter  COURTNEY  BELLMOUR  Return'd so soon  LOUISA  Why look you pale good Uncle  COURTNEY  To bring unwelcome tidings to the wretched  Gives the sad teller half the hearer's woe  BELLMOUR  Friendly preparative what follows next  Can be but Woodly's ruin  COURTNEY  He's undone  LOUISA  Unhappy Bellmour  COURTNEY  Near your house I met him  Hemm'd by a swarthy guard of licens'd villains  The Law's grim bloodhounds with rapacious talons  Who dragg'd him on in merciless serenity  To shut him from his hopes in joyless prison  BELLMOUR  Oh  COURTNEY  At short distance near the Sycamore  That marks the turning to that nowfall'n house  Of this poor Gentleman I saw his Wife  Wild with a storm of grief her Babes amaz'd  Struggling with weeping Servants to break free  Fain wou'd she follow him to share his prison  With straining eyes she kept him long in view  And when a gushing flood obscur'd her sight  Still more to lengthen out a last sad look  She wip'd away the tears and gaz'd again  LOUISA  Dreadful descriptionclose it here good Uncle  It cuts too deep and wounds my Bellmour's soul  COURTNEY  Yet more remains to tell his spacious house  Is fill'd with Ruffians his rich goods torn down  His frantic Wife and Children roam unshelter'd  Without a home to succour them  LOUISA  O guide them hither  Let me with open arms fly to receive them  And strive if possible to give them comfort  BELLMOUR  Louisaas thou would'st preserve my life  Bring not their grief too near me  To see it would distract mesaid he nothing  COURTNEY  Marking me as I turn'd my face aside  He call'd and counsell'd you to save yourself  By sudden flight since other Russians brought  By Bargrave your malicious creditor  Will presently be here on the same purpose  As for my fate said he bid him not mourn it  To fall for Bellmour would have given me joy  Had Bellmour's self not fall'n  BELLMOUR  He falls indeed  COURTNEY  Now as I enter'd Bargrave just arriv'd  With his infernal crew besets your gates  LOUISA  Now Bellmour thou art lostimmediate ruin  Will swallow thee and me and our dear children  All all must sink togetherteach us good Uncle  Which way to fly what measures to pursue  COURTNEY  The doors fast barr'd are guarded by your Ser∣vants  And you may thro' the grove escape unseen  BELLMOUR  No let him enter This Bargrave taught me vice  And counsell'd each excess that has undone me  He wrongs the Devil who makes himself the punisher  Of ills which he excited Justice acts wisely  Oh she's not blindshe chuses a fit moment  And throws him on my vengeance Let him enter  Perdition seize me if he 'scape my hand  LOUISA  As thou lov'st me Bellmour be not rash  Should'st thou add murder  COURTNEY  Persuade him rather  Sooth him to pity Would he free your friend  And grant some weeks of liberty for trial  What succour may be found you've many friends  BELLMOUR  No Courtney friendship rises but with fortune  And sets when men go downward Yet I thank you  Rage had obscur'd my reason Say to Bar∣grave  I have an offer for his private ear  I will instruct my swelling indignation  To cool and settle like a Courtier's passions  What cannot interest teach us  COURTNEY  Tho' I loath  As the dark adder this detested wretch  I'll try to speak him fair  Exit  BELLMOUR  Leave me Louisa  I would not have thee wound thy innocent eyes  With fight of such a MonsterNor brook I well  That thou who hast been taught to love sincerity  Should'st hear me flatter infamy  LOUISA  Do but think  'Tis for their sakes whom most you wish to suc∣cour  And you will find it easy Farewell he comes  My Bellmour as thou lov'st me oh be careful  Exit  Enter  BARGRAVE  BARGRAVE  So Sir I find you make your house your Gar∣rison  Bold sourfaced centinels admit with caution  Whom you vouchsafe your pass to'Tis great indeed  Girt Sovereignlike within your Palace walls  The Laws must beg admission But the pride  With which your state o'erlook'd me will instruct me  'Till I find means to reach you  BELLMOUR  I sent not for you  Thus to revive old hatred 'Twas my meaning  To set before your eyes the spreading misery  From which a week's short respite may perhaps  Free Woodly and myself nor do you wrong  BARGRAVE  Oh Sirno doubt 'tis likely that seven days  Will pay a Bond which twice seven months and more  Have drawn no interest forWoodly may claim  Some little pityHe's a suffering tool  Who fasts to feed your riots But for you  No plea bears influence What a mass of wealth  Loaded your youth the toil of careful Ancestors  And how it is consum'd let thousands tell  Whose lifted eyes and hands proclaim their won∣der  I dare not whisper itMen would think me mad  And laugh to hear that the onceliberal Bellmour  Is grown a niggard now and like a Miser  Whines for a day of Graceand cries 'twill ruin him  To pay his Creditors  BELLMOUR  Insulting wretch  It grates my inmost soul to suffer this  But my friend's fate depends on't  Aside  You seem'd to speak  As if you pitied WoodlyGive him liberty  And let me fill the place to which you have sent him  I ask no moreFor my own miseries  Perhaps they merit notI'm sure they scorn  What pity thou can'st give them  BARGRAVE  Pity to thee  Who not content to ruin thus thyself  Hast beggar'd all whom blood or foolish friend∣ship  Attracted to thy vortex of destruction  So ends our talkI'll hear no more Sir  BELLMOUR  Nay then  Off mean Hypocrisy I'll make thee hear me  In words which match thy maliceThink low Traitor  From whom I learn'd that guilt with which but now  Thy tongue reproach'd me who but the villain Bargrave  BARGRAVE  Ha villain said you  Offering to draw  BELLMOUR  Yes the villain Bargrave  Touch not thy swordShould'st thou unsheath it here  Thy guardian Devil too weak to save his Minister  Should rise in vain between us  BARGRAVE  I'll hear thee out  BELLMOUR  Who but thyself spread all those snares about me  Which first entangled then o'erthrew my virtue  Who stain'd the native whiteness of my soul  And spotted it with folliesThink how the Bond  Most fraudulently and by shameful arts  Was from my clouded reason won when fumes  Of maddening wine had warm'd my yielding fancy  Fit for a knave's impressionHast thou hu∣manity  And dost not feel a ruin thou hast caus'd  Hast thou reflectionand can'st thou sleep un∣stung  Or have the siends that haunt thy gloomy bosom  Encased thy heart with steel sear'd up thy con∣science  And left all Devil within thee  BARGRAVE  Now take breath  And hear me tell the effect of this fine preaching  I find myself with all these black endowments  Your master and your scourgebut that I scorn thee  I could be angryMark this silent witness  Look on this Bond and curse the woeful hour  That gave thy friend and thee to my disposal  While I seek vengeance not from words but action  Attempts to go out  BELLMOUR  By action did'st thou say I thank thee Bargrave  Thou hast instructed meThat fatal Bond  Shall never rise in Judgment against Woodly  Drawing his sword and putting himself before the door  Bargrave  hastily putting up the bond to defend himself drops it unperceived  Just Heaven that hates oppression points a way  To ease my wretchedness of half it's load  By cutting thro' that chain that binds my friend  Now if thou dar'st defend thy villainies  Unsheathe thy sword and to this guarded door  Force thy wish'd passage thro' the breast of Bell∣mour  They fight and  Bargrave  falls  Enter  COURTNEY  and  LOUISA  COURTNEY  What have you done I fear'd this rash effect  Of rage but half suppress'd  LOUISA  Was this my Bellmour speak was this the way  To ease our wretchednessOh this black chance  Sinks us still deeper cuts us off from comfort  And we can never now be happy more  BELLMOUR  Courtney'twere vain to wish this act undone  Takes up the bond  Secret and sudden like his guardian angel  Let me entreat thee to convey this parchment  Into my Woodly's handSay how it happen'd  Tell him whatever Fate may do with me  I'm bless'd to give him freedom  COURTN  Y  Collect yourself  Guard the doors wellThere's danger near  I will not leave you long  Exit  LOUISA  Hence Bellmour fly  One hour's delay prevents escape for ever  B  LLMOUR  What would'st thou have me do  LOUISA  Let me disguise thee  Then thro' the Grove haste and in some poor Cottage  Intreat a short concealment There I'll find thee  And we'll consult relief from all our woes  B  LLMOUR  Fix'd as my fate I stand unmov'd t' expect it  Seek thy own safety I'll not stir by Heaven  LOUISA  Think how my peace of mind my hope my misery  Depend on thineThus on my knees I urge it  Thou being free may'st find a thousand ways  To succour us but if thou fall'st a Family  A lost a friendless Family falls with thee  Oh if I ever were belov'd by Bellmour  If all my prayers my vows my tears can move him  Let him but grant me thislet him but leave me  Rain then a world of woes upon my head  Let want reproach contempt and all Life's agonies  In ceaseless bitterness of soul afflict me  While thou art safe if I but heave one sigh  One breath of discontent escape my lips  Curse me thyself and make me lost indeed  BELLMOUR  Excellent womanriseTo see thee thus  Is torture beyond bearing  LOUISA  I'll not leave thee  Here at thy feet thus humbled as that dust  Which I shall shortly be when I have lost thee  Here will I grow for ever 'till thou grant'st  This only prayer I make thee  BELLMOUR  Thou bid'st me fly  What would'st thou I should fly from  LOUISA  Danger and misery  BELLMOUR  With whom then must I leave that misery  Must not thyself and those three friendless wretches  Whose being I was cause of and who expect  Aid and protection from a Parent's hand  While I escape must you not all be left  Hell glows in that hot thought be left expos'd  To all the miseries which thou would'st have me  Fly like a Coward from and leave for inno∣cents  Who owe 'em to my baseness no Louisa  LOUISA  Rising  Lost lost for ever  BELLMOUR  No there's a Judge on high  Who sees thy goodness and will sure preserve thee  Come what Fate lists to meBut lov'd Louisa  Give now my sorrows way a solitary thought  Will teach me to resolve for life or wish'dfor death  Exit  LOUISA  Angels assist inspire thy silent reasonings  And from this labyrinth of woes conduct thee  Dreadful our prospectyet all may be well  Heav'n cannot erroft' guides us in the dark  And when we least expect affords relief  Exit  End of Act the First  ACT II SCENE  A Gallery  Enter  BELLMOUR  pensive  BELLMOUR  WHY should I pause nothing can be a crime  Which puts a stop to evil A thousand men  May have been poor as Iand yet liv'd happy  Miseries we make ourselves are borne with ease  But he who beggars his posterity  Begets a race to curse himevery scorn  Which wrings the soul of any future Bellmour  Whom want shall pinch the bones of ages hence  Will mark with shame my unforgotten grave  And reach my guilty soul where e'er it wanders  If to give misery to those to whom  We once gave life is an inhuman crime  How can it be a sin to take life back  And put an end to undeserved woe  Ohdid I feel no misery but my own  How easy were it for this Sword to free me  From all that anguish which embitters life  But when the Grave has given my sorrows rest  Where shall my Wife and tender Babes find com∣fort  Not all the virtues of Louisa's mind  Nor e'en my pretty Prattlers' innocence  Will shield them from unpitying Want's bleak storm  Better a thousand times to lead them with me  Unto the peaceful mansion of cold dea  It shall be donebut how that asks some thought  From those dear destin'd breasts the pointed steel  Must draw no blood to stain my blushing hand  Lest my soul

anxious pain I feel till you are safe  Obtrude my zeal perhaps a few short moments  Before you would have wish'd to be disturb'd  Yon Villains grow impatient for admission  And scarce your Servants guard the gates against them  Storms of bold oaths and horrid imprecations  Mix'd with loud thunderings and the threats of Law  Make my heart tremble and have forc'd me hither  Forc'd me to urge you by all ties of love  Of interest honour hope and future bliss  To fly this dangerous roof and save us all  BELLMOUR  I thank thy gentle careIt is resolv'd  Aside  I have bethought me of the means to evade  The malice of my fortune'Twill be a journey  A little longer than thy love could wish it  Yet not so far but we shall meet again  LOUISA  Oh be the distance wide as Pole from Pole  Let me but follow thee and I am blest  BELLMOUR  It shall be so Louisa  LOUISA  A thousand Angels  Spread their wings o'er thee and protect thy steps  Now thou art kindBut the dear little ones  Shall they go too  BELLMOUR  All all shall go  LOUSIA  Haste then  Let us begone my bounding heart leaps joyful  And I shall smile againBut ah me Bellmour  They are so young so tender is it possible  That they should travel with us  BELLMOUR  Moving innocence  My strong heart bleeds within me at her accents  Aside  A few short steps will lodge us in a place  To her  Of rest and safetyWe shall have leisure there  To weigh our future hopes and seek fit means  To our wish'd endCourtney will soon return  Said he not so  LOUISA  He did and we'll inform him  Of our new purpose and begin our flight  I'll make provision such as best befits  Our haste and our distresses  Going  BELLMOUR  Stay Louisa  Those precious cordials I so lately purchas'd  Gave I to thee or no  LOUISA  You spoke of such  But still forgot to give them to me now  They're not worth memory  BELLMOUR  Nay now most useful  Their virtue is reported sovereign  Against the body's toil or mind's disturbance  LOUISA  I would my Uncle were return'd to counsel us  What can so long detain him sure he's safe  BELLMOUR  Seek him my love whilst I the cordials find  Now King of Terrors to prepare thy ban∣quet  aside  Exit  LOUISA  Oh what a world of ruin has one vice  Detested gaming brought upon us all  Bellmour so honest tender mild by nature  Has that propensity made almost wicked  Stripp'd of the means to satisfy just claims  His harrow'd heart starts not at homicide  And may destroy himself his babes and me  Allgracious Heav'n how will these mis'ries end  I dare not hope but thou art allsufficient  If more of evil yet o'erhang this roof  O for my children's sake just God avert it  Exit  Reenter  BELLMOUR  BELLMOUR  My baleful hand has mix'd the deadly draught  To give it as a cordialGive it whom  Start from thy burning orb thou conscious Sun  And chill thyself to ice at my black purpose  Am I a Parent a Protector Lover  Or has this Devil that heaves about my heart  Transform'd me to a fiendhe has he has  Chain him some angel millions of fathoms down  Heap him with mountains lest he rise again  And in a husband's and a father's breast  Brew horrid murdersI am myself once more  Now let cool Reason's undistracted search  Answer my bleeding soul which dreadful ill  May best be borne by Nature To leave our friends  To grinding sorrow poverty and scorn  With sense of  his  not feeling  any pain  Who gave  them all  or to quit life together  And wanting power to bless make it some merit  Not to leave curses to surviving innocence  I'm mad again Reason herself betrays me  And whispers that this last is tenderest  And murder grows a mercy  Reenter  LOUISA  LOUISA  Found you the cordial  Your little wanderers are ready dress'd  To act the pilgrim with us perhaps 'twill aid  Their fainting spirits yet untried in hardships  Haste love and let's be gone  BELLMOUR  Oh if one moment  One short thought longer she oppress me thus  With melting innocent talk I shall grow soft  Yield her to want and live to be a beggar  LOUISA  Still you are doubtful  BELLMOUR  No I'm fix'dOh Nature  Aside  I left my closet openon a table  In that gold cup which was thy father's present  On the last birthday of our eldest boy  Thoul't find the cordialI have tried 'em all  And what seem'd fittest for the boys and thee  Waits in that cup thy tasting  LOUISA  Courtney stays long  All things are ready and I wish him here  Now for this boasted cordial  Exit  BELLMOUR  Be firm my heart  Stop thy big beat thaw thaw this curdling blood  That thro' my icy veins creeps cold as death  And freezes in its passageWhere is Louisa  But a few moments and she is no more  Now now the unsuspecting innocent  Lifts that last cupNow now she tastes a draught  That snatches her for ever from my sight  And robs me of all comfort Never more  Shall her sweet voice enchant me Never more  Shall her soft eyes look fondly into mine  And shine with swimming languor  Open engulph me and conceal my shame  Befriending Earthor from thy yawning depth  Stream up a petrifying blast to blot out memory  Congeal my blood and fix me here a statue  LOUISA  without  My life my Bellmour  BELLMOUR  Ha 'tis her voice that calls me  It sounded not reproachful  LOUISA  without  Look my Bellmour  These little strugglers will not quit the cordial  But sip it to the bottom  BELLMOUR  Torturing horror  Enter  LOUISA  with an empty cup  LOUISA  Why did'st not come my Bellmour and partake  When twice I call'd you 'Twould have been a scene  Of pleasure to observe with how much eagerness  The little wranglers quarrell'd for the cup  Which having drunk of first I brought to them  I bid them taste it only and told the prattlers  It was their father's present but that word  Transported them to lift their pretty hands  In love and duty and to drain each drop  BELLMOUR  Furies tear me  LOUISA  Have I done aught amiss  Did you not give permission they should taste it  Ere they began the journey  BELLMOUR  Alas Louisa  A long long journey is indeed begun  But endless as eternityThyself  And those dear infants arepoison'd by that cor∣dial  LOUISA  Poison'd by thee Thou say'st it but to try me  If 'twere thy wish that I should die thy love  At least thy pity would have giv'n some warning  Death is a dreadful journey and requires  Much length of preparation  BELLMOUR  By those charms  Which I no more must gaze on and be bless'd  Thou can'st not live an houra last long sleep  Will steal in cold advances o'er thy beauties  And those two beamy suns whose rays dart thro' me  Shall set in endless nightEv'n while we talk  Th' eternal shade will rise at once between us  And sever us for ever  LOUISA  Dreadful contraction  Of that short span which at its longest stretch  Was much too narrow to allow me scope  To speak or look or think my love for thee  What shall I say a thousand tender thoughts  Struggle at once for ventI cannot speak  Death is too hastyI have yet undone  Unspoke unthought a thousand weighty things  O heaven my little oneslet me fly to them  Have I so short a time to gaze upon them  Yet ne'er must see them more I cannot leave thee  What shall I doO bring my children hither  Fly with them to my armsDear dying inno∣cents  O Bellmour Bellmour why has this been done  BLLMOUR  That we might baffle woe here die together  And leave no beggars of our race behind us  See my Louisa I have a saithful guide  Draws a dagger  That will not let me lose thee  Attempts to stab himself  Enter  COURTNEY  COURTNEY  Hold thy rash hand  Wresting the dagger from him  Nor to thy other crimes add Suicide  He thou thought'st slain by thy revengeful arm  Accursed Bargrave is borne hence alive  But slightly wounded tho' awhile he seem'd  Through craft or cowardice bereft of life  BELLMOUR  Has that dire villain 'scap'd and shall my wife  And tender innocents O God be made  A sacrifice for all my load of guilt  COURTNEY  Nor are your wife and childen sacrificed  The hand of Heaven howe'er from mortal eyes  Obscur'd in clouds it seems severe is merciful  Not thy three children and thy wife are fallen  Nor shalt ev'n thou whose meditated crimes  Deserve a signal vengeance now be punish'd  LOUISA  What mean you Sir  BELLMOUR  Thou little know'st alas the certain means  I us'd for their destruction  COURTNEY  Then trembling mark the mazy paths of Provi∣dence  Fearing from late events some dire mishap  I trac'd your footsteps as you sadly rang'd  The lonely Gallery spied a latefill'd Cup  Of deadly poison known by the vessel left  Which had contain'd it mingled with a rich draught  For present use I took it secret thence  Refill'd the Cup with Cordials that remain'd  Without the baneful mixture stood conceal'd  To view what then might hap Louisa came  And snatch'd it thence I follow'd her unmark'd  O'erjoy'd to have been the means to intercept  Her and her children's death  LOUISA  Merciful Heaven  Louisa  and  Bellmour  kneel in adoration of and gratitude to Heaven then em∣brace their Uncle and each other  BELLMOUR  Angels surround thee with unceasing vigilance  To Courtney  And for this friendship ward off every evil  Oh I have err'd but henceforth I am chang'd  COURTNEY  Now hear the rest and Heav'n pronounce thee worthy of't  By a young Kinsman landed from a Ship  That left her Consort scarce a day behind  Woodly has heard tho' mournful happy news  Your absent Brother many years thought dead  Returning rich from the remotest East  Died but in sight of land and has bequeath'd  His whole heap'd wealth to thee  BELLMOUR  Allgracious Providence  Most humbly I adore thee and will trust  Implicitly to thy unerring wisdom  Thou best can'st clear thy mystic dispensations  And make confusion end in beauteous order  Hence may the Gamester learn ere yet too late  To shun that Vice which endless Ills await  Wild as the Sea his maddening passions flow  Himself Wife Children beggar'd at a throw  Oh should a Father or a Husband come  Whom Dice have lured from happiness and home  To listen to our Tale our hope is here  To check one Gamester in his mad Career  THE END
