 AN ESSAY ON GLEETS WHEREIN The DEFECTS of the ACTUAL METHOD of treating those Complaints of the URETHRA are pointed out AND An EFFECTUAL WAY of CURING them indicated  By  J P MARAT  M D  LONDON  Printed for W NICOLL in  St Paul's ChurchYard  and J WILLIAMS in  FleetStreet  Price ONE SHILLING Sewed  TO THE READER  THE candour of the public will need no solicitation when acquainted of the following sheets being written by a foreigner not sufficiently conversant in the language to avoid faults against it which may likewise be the more easily forgiven for the fashioning of the stile being less an object of attention than the im∣portance of matter to the human health  To the Worshipful Company of  SURGEONS  in  LONDON  GENTLEMEN  LONG since Surgeons both in  London  and  Paris  have assumed to themselves the treatment of Venereal Diseases and Physicians generally decline it I cannot conceive what makes it your exclusive province the treating of those diseases since in most cases the whole frame of the body is affected and in very few the hand of an operator is wanted But as the custom prevails I do not pre∣tend to strive against the torrent and content myself with offering to you the most effectual method of curing Gleetsa method which I at first discover∣ed by reflecting on the deplorable situation of a bosom friend and which I after∣wards put in practice at the earnest request of several acquaintances and have ever since followed with constant success  A man of mercenary principles would no doubt keep it a secret but a liberal mind is above such interested procedures To promote the good of society is the duty of all its members besides what an exquisite pleasure it is for a benevolent heart to lessen as much as possible the number of those unfortunate victims who without hope of relief labour under the many evils to which human nature is subject Thus not satisfied with relieving the patients who apply to me I wish I could relieve many more by your hands Happy if in this respect the fruit of my labour is not lost  GENTLEMEN  Your most obedient humble servant J P MARAT  ChurchStreet Soho  Nov    AN ESSAY ON GLEETS c  I ENTER in the subject without any preamble A gleet by the want of skill in those who undertake to cure venereal dis∣eases is but too often the sad consequence  If this essay should meet with approbation I shall offer to the public a new method of radically curing gonorrhoeas in a short time  of a virulent gonorrhoea  The running is ever more or less coloured often of a green tint more often of a pale yellow and sometimes of a dark brown a little blood being mixed with it  The matter discharged comes from the ulcerated glands of the internal tunic of the urethra but when the running suddenly in∣creases it always proceeds or from an inflammation of the muscular tunic as happens after or freely enjoying the bottle and the company of women or from a rarefaction of the fluids  A proof of it is that in this case the running is ever accompanied with a sensation of scalding which is not felt in the other case  caused by the expansion of the internal air as happens in spring and autumn two seasons where the atmosphere being less elastic does not oppose so great a resistance to the action of the internal air  Formerly the running was attributed to a relaxation of the affected parts an opinion still in credit among the ignorant but by introducing a probe in the urethra every one may be convinced that it is wholly caused by ulcers  Daran  who first made this discovery attempted to cure gleets by suppurative bougies His method was soon adopted as the most rational and ever since followed by the best practitioners Undoubtedly it proved suc∣cessful in many cases but in many others proved abortive even in the hands of  Daran  himself  Long I had not seen bougies employed for curing gleets without finding them often ineffectual however as it was not my pro∣vince to treat venereal diseases this method had not engaged my attention Mere chance afterwards obliged me to turn my thoughts to the subject as I shall now relate with the reader's per∣mission  Calling one morning on an intimate friend of mine at  Paris  I found him involved in the deepest melancholy On enquiring into  the cause he acquainted me that having been so long in the hands of  Daran  for the cure of a gleet he at last thought himself free of it when on a sudden he was cruelly disappointed Upon which he begged of me to give him any advice in my power his situation being extremely critical on the point of marriage with a young lady of fortune whom he loved and with whom he could not bear the thought of engaging while under so cruel a circum∣stance On this I said to him all that occurred to me just then for his consolation  After I had lest him I could not help reflecting on his melan∣choly condition and thinking how possibly he could be extricated out of it The best way that offered to my mind was his cure  I indeed considered suppuration as the only method to effect it But not accustomed indiscriminately to adopt a method as soon as it is extolled much less to follow it blindly I enquired into the rea∣sons of the frequent inefficacy of the usual practice and soon was made sensible of them  After mature consideration I called upon my friend and pro∣posed to attempt his cure He readily agreed The same day he took an apartment next to mine I immediately began his treat∣ment attended him closely and by suppuration properly conducted was radically cured in seven weeks  Some months after two of his acquaintances left incurable by  Daran  applied to me requesting my assistance and both were cured in eleven weeks time But here is not the place for enume∣rating cures performed by my method I therefore proceed to point out the defects of the actual practice of preparing and using bougies to cure gleets and shall communicate the proper way to improve it so as never to fail the intention  The actual method of treating gleets is frequently unsuccessful because defective  The first defect is the hardiness of the suppurative common bou∣gies are made with This is obvious from the structure of the af∣fected parts The internal tunic of the urethra although ever irritated in a virulent gonorrhoea is seldom the seat of the disease Its seat is commonly the glandular tunic beneath the muscular as is shewn by the abundance of the suppuration and more plainly by dissecting In such case it is evident that a common bougie introduced in the urethra acting immediately on the internal tunic alone cannot cause but an imperfect suppuration of the ulcerated parts and consequently cannot perfect the cure  If so when the ulcers of the glandular tunic lie at the entrance of the lacunes in the internal tunic how much more when the corroding virus has extended its seat and produced a kind of sinusses as is always the case in inveterate gleets  Another defect in common bougies is a want of degradation in their suppurative virtue  It is well known that practitioners employ but one kind of sup∣purating bougies made with a plaister whose basis is lytargirium of lead and oil of olives whilst in order to conduct suppura∣tion properly bougies should be more or less suppurative according to the stages of the disease  Having for a long while made use of suppurative bougies practi∣tioners use dessicative ones even when suppuration is still abundant But to those who have the least notion of the means employed by nature in the reproduction of fleshy substance it is evident that such a sudden passage from active suppurative remedies to dessicative  ones never can produce the desired effect After a forced suppu∣ration kept so for a long while far from being incarnated the cavity of the ulcers is widened and all the fibres around it have lost their natural elasticity  Thus dissicative bougies employed immediately afterwards being all of an astringent quality and acting on the part alone they are in contact with can only dry and crisp the edges of the ulcers and cause them to become callous The running is therefore stopt for a time and never fails to break out again when circulation is con∣siderably increased by any accidental cause  The use of common bougies as they are actually made is not only defective but unrational and hurtful  In common bougies the suppurative plaister is spread over their whole superficies Now to apply the remedy in every point of the urethra in order to cure some ulcerated parts is certainly very ab∣surd What is commonly alledged in support of such a practice is that it is only by giving to the medicament this extension that it can be sure of reaching and acting on the diseased parts but the seat of the distemper can easily be found by gently introducing a probe into the urethra and there only may the remedy be applied  Absurd did I say this method was it would be well if it was no worse notwithstanding it is but too common for practitioners to assert each that bougies of his own making are not irritating it is a fact that as being such only they can act for without inflamma∣tion no suppuration is to be expected It is plain therefore that the long standing application of an irritating remedy over the whole membrane of the urethra must be attended with fatal conse∣quences such as crispation and afterwards relaxation of its fibres How many patients have I not heard complaining of hav∣ing  nearly lost their virility by the use of those bougies continued for some months In several of them I have even seen the fibres of this membrane so corrugated as that the praeeminence of the glands was retracted within and this retraction was ever accompa∣nied with excruciating pains at the time of erections however the most fatal consequences attending the actual practice of curing gleets is a permanent difficulty of making water Dissicating bou∣gies being employed in order to consolidate the ulcers never fail to dry to an excess the parts they are in contact with they there∣fore produce too hard a cicatrice This makes a more or less strong stricture in the urethra which always reduce the stream of the urine  Pointing out the defects of the actual way of conducting sup∣puration in order to cure gleets is in some sort indicating the proper way to do it but as there are many particulars to be ob∣served in the effectual method of curing those diseases I shall lay down its whole process  My first care is to inspect the parts I take a bougie made of white wax rendered flexible with a little turpentine I make round and smooth one of its extremities which I dip in the mu∣cilage  I use the mucilage of marshmallows instead of oil for it does not oppose the heal∣ing of ulcers as oily substances do  of marshmallows and then I introduce it gently into the urethra up to the urine bladder carefully observing the parts where the patient feels any acute pain which parts I con∣sider as the seat of the disease Being thus made sure where the ulcers are situated I take another similar bougie upon it I mark places corresponding to the ulcers there spread all round a little of a suppurative plaister which I make smooth rolling it between the fingers anointed it with mucilage of marsh∣mallows and I introduce the bougie in the urethra when I judge that the remedy is in contact with the ulcers I bend back the ex∣ternal  extremity of the bougie and to fasten it nothing is want∣ing but to pinch it a little  The suppurative I use at first is diachilum cum gummis rendered softer than usual in order that being further dissolved by the na∣tural heat it may penetrate into the cavity of the ulcers  The space of time I continue using it is proportionate to the inveteracy of the disease and to fix it between proper limits re∣quires the skill of an able practitioner  The caustic humours which an ulcer contains vitiate the nu∣tritive lymph and prevent its assimilation to the substance of the corroded fibres and besides adhering to these fibres they keep them in a state of rigidity and oppose their extension The first reason therefore showing the necessity of suppuration in order to cure ulcers is to evacuate these humours The next is to dissolve the callous edges of the ulcers and to aid the corroded fibres to discharge the viscid fluids with which they are filled  Thus having used diachilum cum gummis I employ four times a day injections made with a weak solution  Although the solution of sal ammoniac be a powerful dissolvent of callous substances yet it does not injure sound parts  of sal ammoniac in common water and order the injection to be kept in the urethra five minutes every time Mean while I make use of a weaker suppurative such as  This unguentum is but little if at all known in England The formula of its composition is to be found in the  Paris  dispensatory  l'onguent de la Mer  The time the injection and suppurative are to be continued is likewise to be proportionate to the inveteracy of the disease and  must be longer if any astringent injection has been made use of or any callous had been discovered in the urethra by passing the probe up to it  When the use of this suppurative is discontinued I employ another made with  Gold lytharge ℥ vj  Oil of olives ℥ xji  Yellow wax ʒ jv  Venet turpentine ʒ ji  Bol Armoen ʒ ji  Every day I render it less suppurative by mixing with it a few drops of Peruvian balsam and continue its use till the ulcers are consolidated  The space of time necessary to perfect the cure of slight gleets is generally from twentyfive to thirty days and of stubborn ones seldom exceeds ten weeks  But to these observations I must add a few others very material  Sometimes patients who labour under these complaints are of a habit of body scorbutic or infected with the venereal taint in such cases the humours ought to be purified before the cure of the ul∣cers is attempted  If the patient is of a phlegmatic or plethoric habit of body the ulcers are always difficult to heal A drachm of bark in powder should therefore be prescribed to be taken in a glass of red wine every day during the treatment  Such is my method of curing gleets and if ten years practice attended with constant success may be allowed a sufficient time to convince of its efficacy I may confidently offer this my idea to the sensible practitioners and flatter myself that every one who shall adopt it will find the greatest satisfaction in this respect  Among the great number of instances I could quote to evince its superiority over all other methods hitherto in vogue I confine my∣self to the two following  In  J A  Esq  contracted a virulent gonorrhoea at  Naples  There he applied to the famous  T  *** Having been some months in his hands without receiving any benefit he went to  Rome  where affairs of importance called for his presence and there likewise he was attended for a long while by some reputed practitioner but with no better success  From  Rome  he went to  Florence  where he was also under the hands of the best surgeons  Two years were already wasted in fruitless attempts when the patient set off for  Paris  and there was for two years together under the care of the celebrated  Daran  During that time he underwent a long course of remedies The running indeed disappeared when dissicative bougies were made use of but returned soon after  A circumstance however which must appear strange at first sight is that the return of the flux was periodical It regularly broke out every year at the beginning of spring and autumn  From  Paris  the patient came over to  London  his place of abode Anxious to be cured he applied to an eminent surgeon whom it would not be candid to name who for eighteen months attended  him with great assiduity Various were the remedies employed to subdue the running Among them the suppuration was again tried and again did the running stop by the use of dissicative bougies When stopt the patient was assured of his being cured and to remove every doubt about it was advised to drink punch pretty freely So he did but no sooner was the tryal made than the running returned with greater violence Vexed at so many disap∣pointments the patient was determined to resign his fate to Nature alone and for a while did not alter his resolution till hearing from a friend of some striking cures of similar complaints I had performed that he might not have any reproach to make to him∣self he resolved to venture a last experiment  When he applied  In  October    to me his running was just coming upon him it was of a deep green both scalding and abundant The erection of the penis was accompanied with excruciating pains and the muscular tunic of the urethra so crispated that the extremity of the glands was retracted inwards The urine spouted out in a small stream slowly and with difficulty Some time he experienced a sort of retention and never could eject it without passing a bougie in the neck of the bladder once a day  My first care was to relax the contracted parts which I did by mucilaginous injections In a week's time no pain was felt in erections the summit of the glands again became proeminous and the scalding was considerably abated  Suspecting the whole mass of the lymph to be infected as the patient was rather of a plethoric complexion I made him for a long while go through a course of sudorific draughts  When his humours were judged well purified I employed sup∣purative remedies as I have explained before and in about three months time the ulcers were consolidated  There are now nearly five years that this gentleman has found himself perfectly cured Ever since the difficulty  When the difficulty of making water which generally attends gleets comes from any other cause but an irritation of the urethra the removing of it requires a particular method  of making water has diminished every day and these eighteen months past he did not need the introducing of a bougie in the neck of the bladder  Such is the first case I was speaking of the second is somewhat more surprizing  Mr J G a celebrated artist  Discretion is a part of the duty of a physician But although ever so reluctant to see their names in public print the gentlemen in question will not decline to appear in support of truth if a private interview was desired by patients I have their word for it  having contracted a virulent gonorrhoea at  Milan  was for several months in the hands of a surgeon in that town and left uncured From  Milan  he went to  Spain  and there was the space of twentyfive years under the hands of all those who had any repute for curing venereal diseases  At first all sorts of remedies were tried in turn by every one of them and at last astringents rashly made use of to stop the running in order to have a pretence for payment  The running once disappeared for eleven months but returned without any apparent cause more violently than ever and ever since till a few years ago broke out again after indulging too freely in drinking  As the seat of the disease was the  fossa navicularis  the urine was always pretty free but all the other cruel symptoms attending gleets were felt  Having laboured twentyseven years under these complaints and being left incurable the patient applied to me His disease was so inveterate that I entertained indeed some doubts of his recovery I however ventured a fair tryal and to my great surprize after he had undergone a regular treatment for eleven weeks he found himself entirely cured at least he has perceived these two years past no appearance of a relapse although he has indulged his bottle And I may boldly assert that the running being not possibly stopt by suppuration the ulcers are certainly healed when they for a long space of time furnish no matter  I shall conclude with this observation that since a radical cure was effected in the two forementioned cases  there is no gleet incurable nay there is none which cannot easily and speedily be cured if properly treated  FINIS
