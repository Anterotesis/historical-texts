 A TRACT ON DUELLING WHEREIN The Opinions of some of the most celebrated Writers ON CROWN LAW ARE EXAMINED AND CORRECTED Either by the Authority of the  same Writers  declared in contradictory Sentiments on the same Subject collated from other Parts of their Works Or by the solemn Decisions of  more ancient Writers of  at least  equal Authority  in order to ascertain the due Distinc∣tion between MANSLAUGHTER AND MURDER  By GRANVILLE SHARP  LONDON FIRST PRINTED IN SECOND EDITION WITH ADDITIONS PRINTED FOR B WHITE AND SON FLEETSTREET AND C DILLY IN THE POULTRY MDCCXC  Whoso sheddeth Man's blood by Man shall his blood be shed for in the image of God made he Man  Gen ix  For blood it defileth the land  Num xxxv  There cannot therefore be any legal  Prerogative  to pardon  wilful

Num xxxv  Caedes manifestè numerantur inter scelera nullo humano jure expiabilia  Inst  PREFACE  THE intention of the following Tract is to prove that the plea of  sudden Anger  can∣not remove the imputation and guilt of  Murder  when a  Mortal Wound  is  wil∣fully  given  with a weapon  That the indulgence allowed by the Courts to  voluntary Manslaughter  in Rencounters and in sudden Affrays and Duels is  indis∣criminate  and without foundation in Law  And that  impunity  in such cases of  volun∣tary Manslaughter  is one of the principal causes of the  continuance  and present  in∣crease  of the  base  and  disgraceful  practice of Duelling  Universal Benevolence including  gentle∣ness patience  and an unaffected  placa∣bility  in our behaviour even towards those  men who injure and affront us is manifestly required of all men who profess the true religion and yet unhappily for the Christian world this most obvious doctrine of the  gospel of peace  is too commonly either mis∣understood or else absolutely rejected though the  temporal  as well as the  eternal happi∣ness  of mankind greatly depends upon a conscientious and proper observation of it For a man cannot be a true Christian with∣out observing this doctrine and yet so generally received is the opposite and contra∣dictory doctrine concerning the necessity of revenging every personal affront with sword and pistol for the sake of what is falsely called  honour  that a true Christian is rarely to be with Nay we are fallen into such gross depravity that the writer of a late publication on  the principles of penal law  has ventured to assert tho' he is in other respects as I am informed a sensible and ingenious young gentleman that  the judge condemns the duellist whilst  he scarcely knows how in his own heart to disapprove his behaviour  p So that one would suppose Christianity to be almost entirely extinct amongst us if its principles are so little regarded  even in our courts of justice  where they ought to be held  most sacred  My readers perhaps will start at such an idea in these enlightened days of reformation but I will even go farther and venture to assert that the Europeans not only cease to be Christians but will no longer deserve the name even of  men  if they persist in such a brutal and diabolical contradiction to the most indis∣pensible principles of the laws of God and nature for nothing deserves to be esteemed  human  that is  unreasonable  and the de∣pravity of which I complain is not only incompatible with the laws of God but absolutely inconsistent with  common sense  Let us view the character of the  mo∣dern man of honour  falsely so called  who thinks it inconsistent with his reputa∣tion to pass over a personal affront with that Christian submission which the gospel requires of all men without exception  Such an one perhaps will alledge that his  honour  obliges him whenever he re∣ceives an affront to  call out  his adversary or  to accept his challenge  lest his  courage  should be questioned and therefore in such case the one must give and the other take what is commonly called  gentlemanlike Satisfaction  But let us examine this per∣version of words The  Satisfaction  to both parties is the risk both of  body  and  soul  in the perpetration of a most  dishonourable base  and  cowardly felony  which cannot therefore be  gentlemanlike  whatever the  satisfaction  of it may be And st It is  Felony  because no man can give or accept a challenge without being guilty of  Wilful Murder  if he  kills  his antagonist which I hope is proved in the course of the  following tract ndly It is  dishonour∣able  because it is an open violation of the indispensible principles enjoined in the two great commandments of the supreme Law viz the  love of God  and the  love of our neighbour  for in this respect the offender is upon the same footing as culprits for  bur∣glary theft  or any other felony the  not having the fear of God before his eyes  being equally applicable to all of them and the common law of England esteems no man qualified to be a member of society who wants this principle The act is therefore highly  dishonourable  and to use a still more humi∣liating term of the same import I must ob∣servedly that it is also  base  because it affords the most apparent proof of a  little Soul  Nec Christiani veteres hoc tantum viderunt sed et philosophi qui dixerunt  pusilli esse animi contume∣liam ferre non posse  ut alibi ostendimus  says the learned Grotius in his d book De jure Belli et Pacis p    being  in reality  a  brutal  revenge  brutal  because  unreasonable  for how can  Honour  be vindicated or retrieved by the commission of a  notorious Felony  and what is  unreasonable  must be disgraceful to human nature and therefore is truly  base  And lastly it is  cowardly  that is when it cannot be imputed to  Ignorance  or  Folly  because a man submits to it contrary to the light of his own reason  for fear  his  courage  should be called in question and yet  he has not courage enough  to withstand the bar∣barous prejudices of a depraved world lest he should suffer some temporal inconveniencies and the  slavish Fear  which he entertains of these for  cowards  always dread the pre∣sent evil most deprives him of that  reason∣able fear  which he ought to entertain of God's judgment because he thinks it at a distance though he knows it must inevit∣ably followI condemn no man in parti∣cular God forbid I speak of the question  only in general inveterate prejudices and customs may perhaps afford some excuse in particular cases to some  individuals  who have  ignorantly  yielded thereto but as  ignorance  is disgraceful to  humanity  I sincerely wish that all persons may enter into as careful an examination of this question as I have done by which they will not only be enabled to avoid a repetition of their crime but also be prevented from attempting to defend what is past and thereby afford the best proof of an ingenuous and honourable heart  This abominable practice of duelling which of late years has increased to a most alarming degree may chiefly be attributed I humbly conceive to the improper indul∣gence which our English courts of justice for about two centuries back have shewn to persons  convicted of killing in sudden affrays and rencounters  through a false idea of mercy due to human failty in cases  of  sudden provocation  without preserving the proper distinction of those cases wherein homicide in  sudden anger  is really excu∣sable by the laws of God and of this king∣dom and the  improper precedents  which have arisen from this  indiscriminate and corrupt practice  have so misled the more modern writers on  Crown Law  that even the greatest and most respectable of them have been unhappily induced to admit doc∣trines on the subject of Manslaughter which are absolutely incompatible with the  proper  and  necessary distinctions  to be ob∣served between  wilful murder  and  man∣slaughter  which they themselves have laid down in other parts of their works and it is on the authority of these just  distinctions  with the necessary consequences arising therefrom and not on my own presumption that this censure is founded which the following tract I hope will clearly demon∣strate  But as my readers might seem to give too much credit to an inconsiderable person like myself were they without a previous intimation of what is proposed to risque any loss of time in the perusal of the argu∣ments and proofs at large on which my vindication for this attempt depends I think it my duty to state the subject and intention of the tract as briefly as I can in this pre∣fatory address that my readers may thereby be enabled to judge without much loss of time whether the matter is of suf∣ficient consequence to merit any more of their attention  I have already mentioned my opinion that  No man can give or accept a challenge to fight  with weapons  on any private difference whatever without being guilty of  wilful murder  if he  kills  his antag∣onist  And the intention of the follow∣ing tract is to shew that the writers on Crown Law have no just warrant for ad∣mitting  the contrary doctrines which they have laid down concerning  sudden affrays  and  rencountres viz  that  the voluntary killing  of a man on a  sudden provocation  is only to be esteemed  Manslaughter  and as such is intitled to the benefit of Clergy And they have also supposed that  an assault  is a sufficient provocation to justify a  volun∣tary manslaughter  Now certain it is that some allow∣ance ought to be made for heat of blood upon a  sudden provocation  in considera∣tion of the extreme frailty of human na∣ture provided that there are no circum∣stances of  malice  in the case As if for instance a man  in sudden anger  should strike another merely  with his fist  or a small  cane  or  stick  meaning only to cor∣rect and should  accidentally kill  this would be properly  manslaughter  which though it is deemed  Felony  as the act of striking or beating another person is in  itself  unlawful  is nevertheless  pardona∣ble  both by the laws of God and man But when two persons fight with  dangerous weapons  an  intention of killing  is  ex∣pressed  by the  weapons  and  such inten∣tion  renders the manslaughter  voluntary  which is the same thing as  wilful  and consequently the  "malice prepensed"  which excludes the benefit of clergy is necessarily  implied  though the sudden anger be but a moment before the fatal stroke for  "malice prepensed"  is thus defined by Sir Edward Coke  That is says he  volun∣tary  and of set purpose though done  upon a sudden occasion  for if it be  voluntary  the law implieth  malice    Inst  cxiii p  And yet the same great lawyer in p    speaks of  voluntary manslaughter  upon  some sudden falling out  as distinct from  murder  which cannot in reason be true for if the  killing be voluntary  the evil  and  malicious intention  is necessarily in∣cluded in the act even though the fatal blow be given merely with  the hand  or a  small cane  or  stick  which I have before mentioned as pardonable cases when the  killing  is not intended for a  voluntary striking  without intention to kill is indeed pardonable though death ensues but a  vo∣luntary killing  is so far from being so that the law according to Lord Coke's own rule  implieth malice  and consequently the same must necessarily be esteemed  Murder  and not merely  Manslaughter  because the necessary marks whereby  manslaughter  ought to be distinguished are absolutely wanting therein for  manslaughter  must be "without  malice  express or implied"    Hale    Blackstone    "  Murder  being aggravated" says Lord Hale  with ma∣lice presumed or  implied  but manslaghter not  And yet all these great and excellent lawyers have unhappily fallen into the same error of treating the  voluntary branch  of  killing as bare  Homicide  or  manslaugh∣ter  whereas all the older writers agree that  killing  is pardonable only in cases  of inevitable necessity  Bracton lib  iii  c    p    b Fleta lib  i  c    And the learned Judge Staunford says  That the whole matter consists in the  inevitable ne∣cessity  without which the  killing  is by  no means excusable  There is but one case of  voluntary Killing  wherein the plea of  sudden Anger  and atrocious provocation may seem entitled to some indulgence and consideration See Note in p  n'est ascun voi ex∣cusable  PC lib  i  c      Now the absurd and depraved notions of  honour  and  gentlemanlike satisfaction  of which I complain could not possibly exist if every conqueror in a duel who kills his antagonist was sure of being  hanged up  as an ignominious  felon  for his own  gen∣tlemanlike satisfaction  and therefore I apprehend that the diabolical practice of settling private differences with sword and  pistol is chiefly to be attributed to the want of punishment due to  voluntary manslaugh∣ter  through the mistaken concessions of the Writers on Crown Law and the false mercy of Juries in consideration of  sudden anger  because  impunity  fosters vice and depravity but more especially in cases of  wilful manslaughter  impunity ought to be esteemed the bane of society as  the guilt of blood  is thereby thrown upon a whole nation or country for it is a supreme law that  whoso sheddeth  man's blood  by  man  shall  his blood  be shed Gen  ix  For  blood  it defileth the  Land  and the  Land  cannot be cleansed of  the Blood that  is shed therein but  by the Blood of him that shed it  Num xxxv  And I hope I have proved by incontrovert∣able extracts from the laws of God that the said judgment is inevitably incurred by all  voluntary killing  except in the legal pro∣secution of justice and in the necessary de∣fence of our lives and properties so that  no  man  has any legal or just right to pardon or re∣mit the punishment due to  murder  or  volun∣tary manslaughter  which are the same crime and equally  unpardonable  in this world for such an indulgence is not only a manifest sin against Almighty God but also against the community at large or  country  for  Blood  it defileth the  land  and the  land  cannot be cleansed of  the blood  that is shed therein but  by the blood of him that shed it  Numb  xxxv  This is not a ceremonial law but a law of morality founded in  divine Justice  which must there∣fore be ever binding Now as  the  Land cannot be cleansed c but by  manslaughter  so that even  the king himself  is absolutely restrained from it See an act of the Edw III whereby it is ordained that a charter of pardon  shall not be granted but only where the king may do it by his oath that is to say where a man slayeth an∣other in  his own defence  or  by misfortune  See also a Note in p on the further limitation of Royal Pre∣rogative by a subsequent Statute of Ric Stat c rendering it obnoxious to  the wrath of God  the blood of him who shed it  the  Land  is surely entitled to that expiation as a matter of  indispensible Right  which when with∣held or withdrawn by  Charters of Pardon  to the guilty is a manifest  injury  and  wrong  to the  land  ie to the whole Country or Kingdom which opens to us the true ground and reason why the Royal Prerogative is so strictly and expressly limited in this point for  Non potest Rex gratiam facere cum injuriâ et damno aliorum  This is an ancient and constant rule "of Law"  Inst p  and an  injury wrong  or  da∣mage  is surely  most intolerable  when it is liable to affect the whole  Land  or  Country  by rèndering it obnoxious to  the wrath of God  I may probably be charged with an unpar∣donable temerity for presuming to censure the writings of some of the greatest and most learned men that this nation perhaps ever produced and I am thoroughly sensible of  the risk and ill consequences to myself in case I am mistaken but a sincere persuasion of being in the right arising from a laborious research and careful examination of the most cele∣brated and approved writers on Crown Law obliges me to prefer what I conceive to be  truth  before the authority of the greatest names  And even though I should not have suc∣ceeded according to my own conceptions of the subject yet I trust that my impartial readers will pardon any  involuntary errors  that they find in the performance especially if they see no cause to suspect any want of uprightness in the intention of it and at all events I hope that the attempt may at least be considered as a proof that I am not afraid of difficulties and labour nor of the risk of personal inconveniences when I un∣dertake any point with a view of serving my country or mankind in general  London  d Sept  GRANVILLE SHARP  A TRACT ON DUELLING  NO MAN can give or accept a chal∣lenge to fight  with weapons  and  kill  his antagonist on any private difference whatever without being guilty of  Wil∣ful Murder  such as ought to be excluded from the benefit of clergy For  Wilful Murder  is the killing of a man  ex ma∣litiâ proecogitatâ  Pleas of the Crown p also Hal P C  which  malice  is either  implied  or  express  Fitzherbert's Justice of Peace p Lambard's Eirenarcha c p also Inst c vii p  or as judge Hale calls  it  Malice in Law  or  ex presumptione Legis  Hal P C  and  malice  must necessarily be  implied  when a man  wilfully strikes  or wounds another with any  offensive weapon  whatever because that is  an act that must apparently introduce harm  P C p  and the intention to do harm  makes it murder  Ibid  so that the allowance which the writers of the two last centuries have made for  sudden anger  without preserv∣ing a proper  distinction  of the case where∣in it really deserves consideration is unjust in itself as well as dangerous to society for few men would entertain such absurd notions of honour as to think themselves obliged to revenge affronts with their  swords  or  pistols  if the risque of being hanged up as felons and murderers for their own  gentleman∣like satisfaction  was rendered obvious by  just and proper decisions of the Law on this point  In every charge of murder  the fact of killing being first proved  all the cir∣cumstances of Accident Necessity or Infirmity are to be satisfactorily proved by the prisoner unless they arise out of the evidence produced against him for the law presumeth the fact to have been  founded in malice  until the contrary appeareth  Judge Foster  The cases of homicide which are justi∣fied or excused by the abovementioned  circumstances  of  Accident  and  Necessity  are well understood and by many emi∣nent writers sufficiently explained un∣der the heads of  Misfortune  and  Selfdefence  But with respect to those cases of Homicide which are attended with  circumstances of  infirmity  the third branch of circumstances mentioned above the writers on crown law in general have been  very indiscriminate  notwithstanding that the true distinction between  Murder  and  Manslaughter  de∣pends entirely on a clear stating of those cases of  infirmity  which really deserve consideration and excuse  Judge Foster indeed is for the most part nice and accurate in his distinctions yet he has paid so great a regard to the authority of  precedents  that he has been unwarily led away as well as other writers from the necessary conclusions of  his own arguments  upon this point I shall nevertheless make use of his words as far as they express my own opinion of the subject  Whoever would shelter himself under the plea of  Provocation  must prove his case to the satisfaction of the jury The  presumption of law is against him till that presumption is repelled by contrary evidence What degree of  Provocation  and under what circum∣stances heat of blood the  Furor bre∣vis  will or will not avail the De∣fendant is now to be considered  Words of Reproach how grievous soever are not a Provocation suffi∣cient to free the Party killing from the  guilt of murder  Nor are inde∣cent provoking actions or gestures expressive of contempt or reproach  without an assault upon the person  p But I think myself obliged to add that even  an assault  See my Remarks in p  c on Mr Hawkins's assertions relating to this point  upon the person  is NOT  a Provocation suffi∣cient to free the Party killing from the  guilt of murder  though this  learned judge seems to think otherwise See Sect iii p unless all the cir∣cumstances which are necessary to ren∣der it excusable by the plea of  self∣defence  can clearly be proved For if  the Killing  in a sudden fray is not  ex necessitate  as in Selfdefence or in the lawful Defence of others it must be esteemed  voluntary  and  voluntary  is the same thing as  wilful  which neces∣sarily includes  malice  For Bracton says  Crimen non contrahitur nisi  Voluntas nocendi  intercedat voluntas et pro∣positum distinguunt  Maleficium  c  The Guilt is not incurred unless the  intention of injuring  intervenes for  the Intention and Purpose  or design marks the  Felony  or malicious Deed  Lib iii c So that  malice  must necessarily be  presumed  whenever the  killing  is not  ex necessitate  especially if the fatal blow be  wilfully  given with  a weapon  for in that case a man must  necessarily be supposed to strike  cunt occidendi animo  with murderous in∣tent  because the  Voluntas nocendi  is apparent and consequently the  malice  in such a case is not only  implied  but clearly  expressed  so that the  sudden anger  is only a further proof of  the malice  and "  intention  to do harm"  Bracton has accurately laid down the proper distinction to be observed in the plea of  an excusable Necessity  for killing  Quo casu distinguendum est utrum  Necessitas  illa fuit  evitabilis  vel non Si autem  evitabilis  et evadere posset abs∣que occisione tune erit  reus homi∣cidii  and a felonious  homicide  or  manslaughter  in the days of Bracton had the same meaning that we now apply to  Murder    Si autem  inevi∣tabilis  quia occidit hominem sine odii meditatione  in metu dolore  animi  se et sua liberando cum aliter    mortem propriam  Fleta lib i c  evadere non posset non tenetur ad poenam homicidii  In which case it is necessary to distinguish whether that  Necessity  was  avoidable  or not for if it was  avoidable  and might have been  evaded  without Killing then he shall be guilty of  Manslaughter  i e Murder in those days  but if it was  inevitable  for that he killed the man without any prepence of hatred but  in fear and grief of Mind  in delivering himself and his own when otherwise he could not escape he shall not  in such case  be held or be liable to the penalty of Murder    Bract lib iii c And Staunford remarks that  the necessity  ought to be so great that it ought to be esteemed  inevitable  or otherwise it shall not be excused so that the whole matter consists says he in the  inevitable necessity  without which the  killing is by no means excusable  Nota que la necessite doit etre cy graunde que il doit estre existimé  inevitable  ou autrement il n'ex∣cusera c eins tout la matier consist in le  inevitable necessité  sans quel  le tuer  n'est  ascun voi excusable  Staunford P C lib i c  so  that the learned Judge Foster certainly goes too far when he insinuates in the passage before cited  that  an assault  upon the person  without mentioning the necessary exception con∣cerning  inevitable Necessity    is a pro∣vocation sufficient to free the party killing from the guilt of murder  For a farther distinction besides that of  inevitable necessity  is also to be ob∣served which is very accurately laid down even by judge Foster himself in p though the same would be use∣less if  an assault upon the person  was to be admitted as a  sufficient provocation  to the act of  killing  It ought to be remembered says he that in all other cases of homicide upon slight provocation  But I have already shewn that  no provocation  whatever can justify a  voluntary  or  wilful killing  if it may be reasonably  collected  from the weapon  made use of or from any other circumstance that the Party  intended to kill  or to do some great bodily harm  such Homi∣cide  will be Murder The mischief done is irreparable and the outrage is considered as flowing rather from  brutal rage  or  diabolical malignity than from human frailty  And it is to  human frailty  and to that alone the Law indulgeth in every case of felonious Homicide  The first instance which he gives by way of illustration to this doctrine is cited from Judge Hale vol i p  If  A  come into the wood of  B  and pull his hedges or cut his wood and  B  beat him whereof he dies this is  manslaughter  because though it was not lawful for  A  to cut the wood it was not lawful for  B  to beat him but either to bring him to a Justice  of Peace or punish him otherwise according to law  But here Lord Hale is not sufficiently distinct in stating the case because circumstances are wanting which are necessary for the determination of such a case whether it ought to be esteemed  manslaughter  or  murder  The accurate Judge Foster was sensible of this want of  necessary circumstances  and therefore adds  But it must be understood says he that he beat him  not with a mischievous intention  but meerly to chastise him for the trespass and to deter him from committing the like For if he had knocked his brains out with  a bill or hedgestake  or had given him  an out∣rageous beating  with an ordinary cud∣gel beyond the bounds of a  sudden resentment  whereof he had died  It had been Murder  For these circum∣stances are some of the genuine symp∣toms of the  Mala Mens  the heart  bent upon mischief which as I have already shewn enter into the true notion  of Malice  in the legal sense of the word  P  The next instance he mentions is that of the parker tying the boy to his horse's tail Which was says he  held to be murder  For it was a deliberate act  and savoured of cruelty  But the third instance viz that of Sted∣man the soldier killing a woman  with a sword  which Judge Foster mentions as a case that  was held clearly to be no more than manslaughter  was most cer∣tainly  wilful murder  for tho' it appeared that the woman had struck the soldier on the face with an iron patten yet she afterwards fled from him and he  pur∣suing  her  stabbed her in the back  Now if such a case of  wilful killing  is to be esteemed only manslaughter it  entirely perverts the just arguments already quoted from the same author concerning the cases wherein  human frailty  deserves to be  indulged  May I not use his own words against him That "these circumstances" the pur∣suing and stabbing the woman in the back  are some of the genuine symp∣toms of the  mala mens  the  heart bent upon mischief  Whereas if he had  struck her  merely with his fist or with a small stick  not likely  to kill and had unluckily and against his  intention killed  it had been but  manslaughter  For this is the necessary distinction for which I contend  in all cases of killing  where the  striking  not the killing is  voluntary  and I cannot so well express my meaning as in the words of Judge Foster himself though that sensible and acute reasoner is afterwards misled from the truth of his own doctrine by  paying too much regard I mean an  indiscriminate  regard to the practice of the Courts which in this point has frequently been erroneous  In page after the st section already quoted concerning the cir∣cumstances which  are not a provo∣cation sufficient to free the Party Killing from the Guilt of Murder  he adds  This rule will I conceive says he govern every case where the Party Killing upon such provocation  maketh use of a deadly weapon  or otherwise  manifesteth an intention to kill  or to do some some great bodily harm But if he had given the other a box on the ear or had struck him with a stick or other weapon  not likely to kill  and  had unluckily and against his intention  killed it had been but  manslaughter  The difference between the cases is plainly this In the for∣mer  the malitia the wicked vindictive disposition  already mentioned  evidently appeareth  in the latter it is  as evidently wanting  The Party in the first trans∣port of his passion intended to chas∣tise for a piece of insolence which few spirits can bear In this case the benignity of the law interposeth in favour of human frailty in the other its justice regardeth and  punisheth the apparent malignity of the heart  P and  Nevertheless the same author in p endeavours to excuse killing in  sudden rencounters  without preserving this necessary distinction concerning  "the use of a deadly weapon"  and  the intention to kill  To what I have offered says he with regard to  sudden rencounters  let me add that the blood already too  much heated kindleth afresh at every pass or blow And in the tumult of the passions in which  meer instinct selfpreservation  hath no inconsider∣able share the voice of reason is not heard And therefore the law  in condescension  to the infirmities of flesh and blood hath extenuated the of∣fence  But  the Law  in reality makes no such  condescension  though  the Courts of Law  have indeed  indiscrimi∣nately  done so and have occasioned a mul∣titude of bad precedents wherein  wilful murder  has been excused under the name of  manslaughter  and this unhappy dif∣ference between  the Law  and the cor∣rupt practice of  the Courts  with respect to this point has unwarily led the more modern writers on crownlaw into con∣cessions which are absolutely  contra∣dictory  to the just doctrines laid down in other parts of their excellent works  When I speak of such respectable and justly revered authors as Sir Edward Coke Sir Matthew Hale Lord Chief Justice Holt c No person can conceive that I am misled by personal or party prejudice against their opini∣ons and as I have really the highest esteem and veneration for their memory not only as great and learned lawyers but as true patriots and above all as sincere Christians and worthy honest men I should not presume to contro∣vert any point that has been laid down by such excellent lawyers  so accomplished as above  was I not armed by  their own authority  for  no other authority  is suf∣ficiently authentic for the purpose of correcting such deservedly esteemed wri∣ters though I must acknowledge my obligation to the  more ancient  writers for the discovery of the errors of which I complain  The proper distinction to be observed  between  murder  and  manslaughter  is well laid down by Sir Matthew Hale  "Mur∣der"  says he  being aggravated with malice  presumed  or  implied but man∣slaughter  Not  Hale's P C  See also the Statute Hen c made at Marlbridge A D Title  What kind of  Manslaughter  shall be adjudged  Murther  Mur∣ther from henceforth shall not be judged before our justices where it is found  misfortune  only but it shall take place in such as are  slain by felony  and not otherwise    This rule is good and unexceptiona∣ble and therefore it must appear that even Sir Matthew Hale himself is mis∣taken in the paragraph preceding this quotation where he says that  Man∣slaughter  or  simple homicide  is the  vo∣luntary killing  of another without  ma∣lice express  or  implied  for though there may be a  voluntary striking  with∣out  malice  yet I hope I have already proved that there cannot be a  voluntary killing  without  malice express  or  implied  except in the legal execution of justice and in the case of  selfdefence  and its several branches which some writers rather improperly have indeed called  voluntary  Lambard's Eirenarcha Sir Edward Coke's Inst p and  though they proceed from an  inevitable neces∣sity  See the note in page  Nevertheless even the great Sir Edward Coke and before him the learn∣ed Lambard in his Eirenarcha p was guilty of this same impropriety of expression "Some manslaughters" says Sir Edward Coke Inst cap viii p  be voluntary  and not of  malice forethought  upon some  sudden fall∣ing out  Delinquens per iram pro∣vocatus puniri debet mitius  He who provoked by anger offends ought to be more mildly punished  And this for  distinction sake  says he is called  manslaughter  But it is a very  indiscriminate distinction  if I may  use such an expression concerning the writings of so great a man because the maxim "Delinquens per iram" c can only be admitted in case where the  malice  is  neither express  nor  implied  for instance when the  Striking  is  volun∣tary  but the  Killing  or  Manslaughter  is  involuntary  and  unexpected  as when a man  in sudden anger  gives an un∣lucky blow merely with his fist or with a small stick or small stone  See judge Foster's comment on Rowley's case wherein the difference of striking with a  dangerous weapon  and with a small stick or  cudgel not likely to destroy  is well expressed pages and  I have always thought Rowley's case says he a very extraordinary one as it is reported by  Coke  from whom  Hale  cites it The son fights with another boy and is beaten he runs home to his father all bloody the father takes a staff runs three quarters of a mile and beats the other boy who dieth of this beating This is said to have been ruled man∣slaughter  because done in sudden heat and passion  for which he cites Rep and Hale "Surely" continues judge Foster  the provoca∣tion was not very grievous The boy had fought with one who happened to be an overmatch for him and was worsted a disaster slight enough and very frequent among boys If upon this pro∣vocation the father after running three quarters of a mile had set his strength against the child had dispatched him with  an bedgestake  or  any other deadly weapon  or by repeated blows with his cudgel it must in my opinion  have been murder  since any of these circumstances would have been a plain indication of the  malitia  that mischievous vindic∣tive motive before explained But with regard to these circumstances  with what weapon  or to  what degree  the child was beaten  Coke  is totally silent But  Croke  setteth the case in a much clearer light and at the same time leadeth his readers into the true grounds of the judgment His words are Rowley struck the child with a  small cudgel  Godbolt calleth it a rod meaning I suppose a  small wand  of which stroke he afterwards died I think it may be fairly collected from  Croke's  man∣ner of speaking that the accident happened by  a single stroke  with a cudgel  not likely to destroy  and that death did not immediately ensue The stroke was given in heat of blood and not with any of the circumstances which import the  malitia  the malignity of the heart attending the fact already explained and therefore  Manslaughter  I observe that Lord  Raymond  layeth  great stress  on this cir∣cumstance  That the Stroke was with a Cudgel not likely to Kill  meaning  only to correct which  undesignedly  oc∣casions death for in such cases the  malice  is not  implied  whereas in a  voluntary homicide  even a  Malice pre∣pensed  is implied according to Sir Ed∣ward Coke's own definition of that term viz "That it is  voluntary  and of set purpose  though it be done upon a  Sudden Occasion  for if it be  Volun∣tary  the law  implieth Malice  Inst c xiii p Sir William Blackstone has also fallen into the same error in his th vol chap xiv p where he in∣forms us that Manslaughter is  the un∣lawful killing of another without malice either  express  or  implied  which may be either  voluntarily  upon  a sudden heat  or involuntarily but in the  commission of some  unlawful act  In both of which he is also mistaken for with respect to the latter his doctrine cannot be admitted except in cases where the circumstances of the  unlaw∣ful act  amount only to  a bare trespass  Which he himself elsewhere allows  Judge Foster in his second discourse of homicide p where he treats of  involuntary homicide  in the commission of an  unlawful act  informs us  that if it be done in the prosecution of a  felonious inten∣tion  it will be  Murder  but if the intent went no farther than to commit  a bare trespass  Man∣slaughter Though I confess say he Lord Coke seemeth to think otherwise  That is Lord Coke did not even make an allowance for "  a bare tres∣pass  " but seems to have been of opinion That every case of  involuntary homicide  is to be treated as  Murder  whenever the act which occasions death may be esteemed  unlawful  See Inst p to which judge Foster refers But that learned judge could not mean that he differed in opinion from Lord Coke concern∣ing the first case there stated under the head of  unlaw∣ful  viz the unlawful shooting at a deer whereby a boy was killed by the glance of the arrow because that case must necessarily be esteemed  Murder  ac∣cording to judge Foster's own rule abovementioned for Lord Coke has clearly stated a  felonious intention  viz  A meaning  to steal  a deer in  the park  of B c  It must therefore appear that he refers only to the d case there mentioned of a man shooting at a cock or hen or any  tame fowl of ano∣ther man's  for a person might wantonly shoot at another man's pigeons or poultry without any in∣tention to  steal them  which I conceive would amount to no more than  a bare trespass  in judge Foster's sense of the word because  voluntas et propositum distinguunt maleficia  furtum  vero non committitur  sine affectu furandi  Fleta lib i c p Whereas if Lord Coke had added in the supposed case that there was an intention  to steal  the tame fowl Judge Foster could not reasonably have dissented from his opinion because the crime must necessarily have been adjudged  Murder  according to his own rule for the very same case has been so laid down by Lord Chief Justice Holt in a very clear manner see pages and of this tract in order to explain Lord Coke's assertion though Judge Holt himself is as apparently mistaken in his Judg∣ment of the other Case wherein the occasion was an intention to  steal a Deer  which is at least as  felo∣nious  as the intention of  stealing a Hen  that is if the Deer be tame and  inclosed  in  a Park  as stated by Lord Coke by which the  property  is rendered ap∣parent but if the case had been stated that the Deer was in a  Forest  or open chase the offence  with∣out the accident  would be only a  Trespass  See Hawkins P C Book i c xxxiii § and the idea of this latter position may probably have occasioned Lord Holt's mistake for this circumstance would have rendered the  accidental Killing  of the Boy only  Manslaughter  agreeable to his opinions Compare pages and wherein Lord Holt's opinions of these two Cases are mentioned  For I propose in the course of this tract to mention several allowed cases on  good authority wherein even the  invo∣luntary  or undesigned killing is not deem∣ed  manslaughter  but  murder  when the acts which occasioned death were  un∣lawful  and with the respect to the for∣mer it is a manifest  inconsistency  in all these great writers to rank  voluntary killing  under the head of  manslaughter  in the modern  confined  sense of that  once general  term because a  voluntary kill∣ing  except in the case of  selfdefence  through inevitable necessity which some writers have rather improperly called  voluntary  Lambard's Eirenarcha "The last member says he of  voluntarie homicide  is where one man kill∣eth another in his  own defence  c" and Sir Edward Coke speaking of selfdefence in Inst p and says "this is  voluntary  and yet no felony" Sir Matthew Hale is more accurate for when he speaks of homicide  ex necessitate  he informs us  that this necessity makes the homicide not  simply voluntary  but mixed partly voluntary and partly involuntary and is of two kinds  c vol  is certainly the same thing as a  wilful killing  and either of them must be allowed to be the proper defi∣nition of what we now understand by the term  Murder  though the meaning of that word was originally very dif∣ferent See le Mirroir de justice c i sect xiii p and Lambard's Eirenarcha c vii p because in  a voluntary or wilful killing malice  is necessarily  implied  and consequently  voluntary killing  is excluded from the favour due to manslaughter by the rule  which these learned writers themselves admit  viz  that manslaughter is with∣out out malice  express  or  implied  so that they are really guilty of a  contradiction in terms  because the  malice  or  inten∣tion of killing  is  undeniable  if the  killing  be  voluntary  And where a man doth any cruel and  voluntary act  whereby death ensues  it is murder though done of a sudden  See a little book dedicated to Lord Bathurst in intitled The  Laws  of Liberty and Property p  and therefore as it is a maxim that  Allegans contraria non est audiendus  Jenk Cent fo I am compelled to reject the definition of  manslaughter  given by these learned writers as far as it is contradictory to to that excellent rule already cited for the distinction of  manslaughter  from  murder  which they themselves admit viz that  manslaughter is without malice express or implied  The errors of which I complain were not originally occasioned by these cele∣brated  authors but by a previous  cor∣rupt practice in the courts  which had been introduced by degrees and at last unhappily prevailed through a false idea of mercy and consideration for  sudden anger  and also through the want of preserving the  proper distinction  of cases wherein  manslaughter  in  sudden anger  is really excusable The proper distinction to be observed is when the  inten∣tion  of  killing  is not necessarily  impiled  in the act itself as when a man strikes ano∣ther merely with his hand in sudden anger or thrusts him suddenly from him whereby he falls and receives a hurt which occasions death in these and similar cases the striking or thrusting is indeed  voluntary  yet the  killing  or  manslaughter  is not so but entirely undesigned and unexpected which proper and necessary distinction the Law Commentators have unhappily neglected For though the act of  stri∣king  or thrusting in anger  bears some re∣semblance to  malice  and though such an act is certainly  unlawful in itself  yet it is reasonable to make some allow∣ance for the frailty of human nature and the sudden passion of a man that is provoked whenever  a more criminal malice  is not necessarily  impiled  in  the act itself  which occasions death And in this lenity we are justified by the laws of God whereby such cases of manslaughter  in sudden anger  as I have mentioned were excused without any other penalty than that of banish∣ment to a city of refuge  If he  thrust  The thrusting  here mentioned which some writers seem to have misunderstood does not mean a  thrust  with a sword or other weapon for the word  has no such meaning but properly signifies a violent thrusting or shoving away as with the hand or a sudden driving away as chaff is drove before the wind as Bythner remarks "Proprie dicitur de vento qui rapta prosequitur" Lyra prophetica p  him  suddenly  without  enmity  Here a proper distinction is preserved between  sudden anger  and  enmity    Numb xxxv the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge c  v Yet the very same action if done  in ha∣tred    see the th verse and even a blow with the hand  in enmity    see the st verse apparently meaning when there was an  express proof of ma∣lice  or intention to kill were to be deemed  unpardonable  "he shall surely die"  But it is remarkable that these are the  only  two  cases  wherein  an express proof of malice  was required for in all the examples given in the same chapter of killing  with a weapon  or with  a stone wherewith a man may die  meaning such a stone as from its shape or size might be deemed a sufficient weapon to occa∣sion death there is not the least men∣tion  made of  malice    Hatred or  Enmity which is a sufficient proof that the same were necessarily  implied  from the stroke when given with a  weapon  for in that case the com∣mand was peremptory  If he smite him with an instrument of iron so that he die  he is a  murderer    Retsch or Killer perhaps from thence the Eng∣lish word  wretch  "the  murderer  The Word  Murder  was anciently understood in the same  general sense  as the Hebrew  to kill so that Judge Foster is mistaken when he says p that  our oldest  writers made use of the term  murder  in a very narrow limited sense  The Sense was  afterwards  indeed restrained to  hidden  manslaughter whereof the author was not known but in later times it was still once more changed to the sense in which it is at present understood viz that of  wilful man∣slaughter  wherein  "malice prepensed"  is either  express  or  implied  See Lambard Book cvii p and  In old time says he every killing of one man by another was of the effect called  murder  because death ensued of it For as Postellus noteth of the Hebrew word  Moth  came the Latine  Mors  and thereof our elders the Saxons called  and  as we now sound it Afterward about the time of M Bracton murder was restrained to  a se∣cret killing only  and therefore he in the definition of murder saieth that it is  occulta occisio  c with whom Britton agreeth also But since the statute Edw IIIc by which the presentment of  Englesherie  was taken away  Murder  is taken in a middle degree neither so largely as it first was nor so narrowly as it afterward became to be For  Mur∣der  is now construed to be where one man of  malice prepensed  killeth another feloniously that liveth with∣in the realme under the protection of the queene whether it be openly or privilie and whether the partie slayne be English or alien  And then he proceeds to shew that the  "malice prepensed"  may be either  apparent  or  implied  shall  surely be put to death  v the same also if he smote him with  a stone wherewith he may die  or with  an hand weapon of wood  But in none of these cases is there the least mention of  malice  which was therefore most certainly  implied  and the  congregation  to which our trials  per Pares  are in some degree similar were to judge  "according to these judgments"  see th verse For the slayer was not  to die un∣til he stood before the congregation in judgment  see th verse and then if it did not appear that the killing was at  unawares    in error see th verse or as the same meaning is ex∣pressed in different words in Deut xix  ignorantly  or  without know∣ledge  agreeable to the example there laid down for all other cases of mere  misfortune  As when a  man  goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the helve and lighteth upon his neigh∣bour that he die  c Deut xix or as it may rather be rendered the  iron glanceth from the tree  and findeth  his neighbour that he die  which corresponds in some measure with that less explicit case mentioned in Exodus xxi where God is said to  deliver him into his hand  or rather to make him  meet his hand  as Mr Haak translated it in as if a man should accidentally come in the way of a stroke that was aimed at some other object for  as God is the Lord of life and death whose Provi∣dence is over all his works the scripture teaches us to ascribe to him all such events as in common phrase are called  accidental  Dr Dodd and so Castalio translates the passage  "In eum fortefortuna incur∣rerit"  which he further explains in a note as fol∣lows  In Hebraeo est  Deus ejus manui injecerit  Sed Deus pro  fortuna  Hebraicè ideo dicitur quod quae putant homines  casu fieri  utpote quae non prae∣viderint ea  Dei  providentiâ fiunt cui nihil fortuitum esse potest c  The learned Selden who was most deservedly esteemed for his knowledge in the laws both of God and men supposed also that the text in Exodus xxi might relate to  involuntary homicide  and he accordingly refers to it from his first division of that head  Prima est quando  ex errore    igno∣rantiâ  simplici atque infortunio nec tamen sine culpâ levi ex negligentiâ aliquâ qualem prudentiores seu cordatiores sugerent contractâ omnino interea  nolens quis  hominem occiderat juxta illud in lege sacrâ Exod xxi Qui non est insidiatus sed  Deus tradidit illum in manum ejus  ponam tibi locum quo confugiat  Tom Tract de Jure Naturali Gen∣tium cap ii  de homicidio involuntario  seu quod casu sactum ac errore c  the malice was presumed  from the  weapon  with which the stroke was made for  the hatred  and en∣mity  were never enquired after in any cases where a  wilful  stroke was given with  "an instrument of iron"  or  a weapon of wood  or even with  "a stone wherewith a man may die"  that is if it were such a stone as was appa∣rently capable of occasioning the death of a man see Numb xxxv to all which crimes were unpardonable by the law of God  "he shall surely die"  And the Levitical Law is certainly in this point  still binding  even under the dispensation of the gospel because the reason and justice of it still subsists as in other  moral laws  So that the allowance usually made for  sudden anger  when the blow is  given with a weapon  is so far from deserving the name of  "a proper distinction in the crime of killing"  as some contend that  it is apparently founded in  a want  of that  proper distinction  which the laws of God and reason require concerning cases of  manslaughter  wherein  sudden anger  is really excusable which can only be when  the killing  is not  voluntary  or at least  the intention of killing  not apparent as in the cases beforementi∣oned of a man striking another merely  with his hand  See a case supposed by Judge Holt in his edition of Kelyng's Reports Regina versus Mawgridge  Suppose says he upon provoking language given by B to A A gives B a box on the ear or a little blow with a stick which happens to be so unlucky that it kills B who might have some imposthume in his head or other ailment which proves the cause of his death this blow though not justisiable by law but is a wrong yet it may be but  manslaughter  because it doth not appear that he  designed  such a mischief  or fist in  sudden anger  or the sudden  thrusting  See the case of Thompson and Daws cited by Lord Chief Justice Holt in the case  Rex versus Plu∣mer  Kelyng p  Thompson  thrust  away Daws and threw him down upon an iron in the chimney which broke one of his ribs of which he died this upon a special verdict was held to be  only manslaughter  though the peace was broke and the person slain came only to keep the peace and it is the same if he had been constable  that is if he did not declare his intention as it is after∣wards explained and charge the offending parties in the king's name to keep the peace This case is pro∣perly  excuscable manslaughter  because it did not ap∣pear that the  killing  was  voluntary  though the "  thrusting  away" was  voluntary  and therefore the  malice  or intention was neither  express  nor  implied  as in  murder  a man down  by which he is hurt in falling so that death unexpectedly ensues In these and similar cases  the malice  or the  inten∣tion of killing  is not necessarily  implied  in the action itself and therefore if all the other circumstances are also free from premeditated  malice  and laying in wait the law has reserved a  reasonable  use of an  unreasonable  popish indulgence called The Benefit of Clergy to relieve the  undesigning manslayer  if the occasion  was not  unlawful  from the too great severity of the common law for in such cases we may safely admit Sir Ed∣ward Coke's maxim  Delinquens per iram provocatus puniri debet mitius  Inst  "He who provoked by anger offends ought to be more mildly punished"  But a false idea of mercy and consi∣deration for  sudden anger  unhappily pre∣vailing in the Courts this lenity was  indiscriminately  extended even to cases where the  prepensed malice  was necessa∣rily  implied  by the stroke so that the wretch who stabbed his neighbour in  brutal anger  escaped with impunity to the scandal of public justice The bad effects of this  false mercy  and injustice became so notorious in the reign of King James I that the legislature was obliged to seek a remedy and a statute was then made Jac I c by which the  benefit of clergy was taken away from  the offence of  mortally stabbing  an∣other though  done upon sudden provo∣cation  Judge Blackstone's Com b c xiv p But unfortunately this remedy proved almost as  indiscrimi∣nate  as the abuse intended to be correct∣ed by it for it takes no notice of any other crime than that of  stabbing  as if  sudden anger  was not  equally criminal  when a man is killed  "by throwing a hammer or other weapon"  or by  a shot with a pistol  Ibid p Whereas in truth no new law was wanted nothing but a better admini∣stration of the old laws beforementi∣oned for in all such furious sallies of  sudden anger  the  malice  was necessarily  implied  or  presumed from the weapon  as well in the laws of God which I have already shewn as in the law of nations "  Ex telo praesumitur malum consilium  says the learned Grotius  nisi contra∣rium  appareat  From the weapon the evil intention is presumed unless the contrary should appear  And in his second book de Jure Belli Pacis he remarks "that either  iron a club or a stone  comes under the denomination of a weapon  Teli  autem nomine  ferrum fustis    lapis  venit  c i p  The reason of the severity in the di∣vine law against striking  with a weapon  is well expressed by Dr Wells in his paraphrase on Numbers xxxv to  Forasmuch says he as though he might have no malice to him before∣hand yet his striking him  with a sword  or  hatchet  c shews he had  an intention  to do him mischief  and as another writer remarks  though per∣haps he had no  formed intention to kill  the person yet he ought to have mo∣derated his passion and could not be  ignorant that  such an instrument  was capable of inflicting  a deadly wound  And therefore when a man is  killed with a weapon  except it be by  misfor∣tune  or in  selfdefence  Regularly it is necessary that the person that kills another  in his own defence  fly as far as he may to avoid the violence of the assault before he turn upon his assailant for though in cases of hostility between two nations it is a reproach and piece of cowardice to fly from an enemy yet in cases of as∣saults and affrays between subjects under the same law  the law owns not any such point of honour  be∣cause the king and his laws are to be  vindices in∣juriarum  and private persons are not trusted to take capital revenge one of another  Hale p  when the Slayer could retire no further to save himself without striking or else in such law∣ful and reasonable cases wherein a man is not obliged to give back as in the case of a peace officer  If a gaoler be assaulted by his prisoner or if the Sheriff or his Minister be assaulted in the execution of his office  he is not bound to give back to the wall  but if he kill the assailant it is in law adjudged  se∣defendendo  though he  gave not back to the wall  The like of a constable or watchman  c Hale p For which he quotes Co P C p Co Rep b Machally's case  who is assaulted  in his duty or when any other man en∣deavours to keep the peace  Ou il purra dire que il le tua en defendaunt  nostre pees  c  Britton p b  or to save ano∣ther person from violence and oppression  For it is the duty of  every man  to interpose in such cases for preserving the public peace and pre∣venting mischief  Foster p for which he refers to Stanf Inst And in the latter place there are several cafes mentioned wherein  a pri∣vate person  may lawfully interfere  by warrant in law without writ  Lord Hale also allows that  every man  is bound to use all possible lawful means to prevent a felony as well as to take the felon and if he doth not he is liable to a fine and imprison∣ment therefore if B and C be at strife A a by∣stander is to use all lawful means that he may without hazard of himself to part them cIf A be travelling and B comes to rob him if C falls into the company he may kill B in desence of A and therefore much more if he come to kill him and such his intent be apparent for in such case of a felony attempted as well as of a felony committed  every man is thus far an officer  that at least his kill∣ing of the attempter  in case of necessity  puts him in the condition of  se defendendo  in defending his neigh∣bour  Hale p  Ou il purra dire que tout fist il le fait nequedent ne le fist il mye par felonie purpense mes par necessite soy defendaunt  ou sa femme ou sa meason ou sa meyne ou son seig∣niour ou sa dame de la mort  c  Britton p b  And again  ei qui justè possidet licitum erit cum armis contra pacem venientem ut expellat  cum armis  repellere ut per arma tuitionis et pacis quae sunt justitiae repellat injuriam et vim injustam et arma injuriae sed tamen cum talis discretionis moderamine quod injuriam non committat non enim poterit sub tali pretextu

c Foster  in the necessary defence of chastity or when any person resists the  attack of a Robber  Thorp dit que  chescun home peut prender larons  et s'ils ne voilent soi render mes estoient al defens ou fuont in tiel cas  il les peut occire sans blame  Staund∣ford p Also  If a thief assault a true man either abroad or in his house to rob or kill him  the true man is not bound to give back  but  may kill  the assailant and it is not felony  Hale p for which he quotes Co P C p But this rule is subject to just restrictions for  even a thief  is not to be  killed  but through  necessity  "Si alio modo suam tueri possit possessionem c See the preceding quotation from BractonJudge Hale indeed seems to think that a thief may lawfully be killed if he can∣not otherwise be taken  If a person says he be in∣dicted of felony and flies or being arrested by war∣rant or process of law upon such indictment escapes and flies and will not render himself whereupon the officer or minister  cannot take him without killing of him  this is not felony  c  But if he  may be taken without such severity  it is  at least manslaughter  in him that kills him there∣fore the jury is to enquire whether it  were done of necessity or not  Hale for which he cites E Coron Assiz Stamf P C lib cap fol b But this doctrine requires some further restriction for the  necessity  of  taking  a thief or retaking a prisoner or that of executing a civil writ is not so great as to justify  killing  when the person endea∣vours to escape merely by flight the  Necessity  can only be founded  in his resistance  from which no man is bound to give back and this will appear by Lord Hale's own words in another place viz  But if the prisoner  makes no resistance  but flies yet the officer either for fear that he or some other of his party will rescue the prisoner strikes the prisoner whereof he dies this is  murder  for here was no assault first made by the prisoner and so it cannot be  se defendendo  in the officer  And again  If a man be in dan∣ger of arrest by  a capias  in debt or trespass and  he flies  and the bailiff kills him  it is murder  c Hales The same point is still more accurately explained by Judge Foster chap p  I ra∣ther choose to say says he it will be  murder  or  man∣slaughter  as circumstances may vary the case For if the officer in the heat of the pursuit and merely in order to overtake the defendant should trip up his heels or give him a stroke with an ordinary cudgel or other weapon  not likely to kill  and death should unhappily ensue I cannot think that this will amount to more than  manslaughter  if in some cases even to that offence The blood was heated in the pursuit his prey  a lawful prey  just within his reach and no signal mischief  was intended  But had he made use of a  Deadly Weapon  here is the proper distinction for which I contend  it would have amounted to  Murder  The mischievous vindictive spirit the  Malitia  I have already explained which always must be collected from circumstances deter∣mineth the nature of the offence  I say excepting these and similar cases if a man  wil∣fully  strikes another  with a weapon  in  sudden anger  the design  of killing  is by  "the  weapon  rendered  express  as I have before observed though the  prepensed malice  may perhaps more properly upon a  sudden provocation  be said to be  implied  and it certainly is  implied  or  presumed  in law though the  sudden anger  was but a moment before the fa∣tal stroke  I would willingly  except  from this rule If I may be allowed to do so that  sudden anger  which of all others is most deserving of indulgence and privilege as being incited by the most atrocious  injury  and  affront  that one man can possibly receive from another so far doth it surpass  in villainy  every other act of  injustice  and  dis∣honesty  I mean  the  case of a husband taking the Adulterer in the manner  to this case alone as Lord Bacon informs us the ancient Roman law restrained  the privilege of passion to that rage and provocation only  says he  it gave way  that it was an homi∣cide  which was justifiable  But for a difference to be made  adds the learned Chancellor  in case of kill∣ing and destroying man upon a fore thought purpose  as in the case of duelling  between foul and fair  and as it were  between single murder and vyed murder it is but a monstrous child of this latter age and there is no shadow of it in any law Divine or Human  so that if no proof can be  produced by the prisoner of  an inevita∣ble necessity  as in  se defendendo  the act must in reason and justice be deemed  "wilful murder of malice prepensed"  such as was sufficiently excluded from the benefit of clergy by two express acts of parliament Hen VIIIc i and Edw VIcxii previous to the undistinguishing act of James I against stabbing  By an act of the Edw III it was ordained that a charter of pardon  shall not be granted but only where  the  king may do it by his oath  This Statute was confirmed and enforced by two subsequent statutes of the same reign Ed c and Ed c in the plainest terms that words are capable of expressing yet were they not sufficient to root up the  disloyal  practice of  pardoning murderers  for in the following reign King Richard the II as if in preparation to his own destruction paid so little regard to these just and necessary laws that in the par∣liament of his th year  the Commons  made  grievous complaint  see R St  of the outrage∣ous mischiefs and damages which have happened to his said realm for that Treasons  Murders  and  Rapes of Women  be commonly done and committed and  the more because charters of pardon have been easily granted  in such cases  and  the said Commons re∣quested quested our Lord the King that such charters might not be granted  The three former Statutes were  then  as they still are unrepealed and no subsequent Statute had at that time been made that could possibly be construed to affect them or abate their force so that the King's  disloyalty  in granting such  prohibited charters  was notorious and his answer to the Com∣mons was not less  disloyal  than his practice viz  That he will save his liberty and regality as his pro∣genitors have done heretofore  Richard however consented to admit some considerable limitation of his  pretended prerogative  in pardoning  murder  See stat c whereby it is ordained  that no charter of par∣don from henceforth shall be allowed  FOR MURDER  or for the death of a man slain by await assault or malice prepensed Treason or Rape of a Woman un∣less the same murder  c  be specified in the same charter  On a slight view the word "UNLESS" may seem by a negative implication to admit the  al∣lowance  of a  charter of pardon for murder  but Sir Edward Coke has remarked upon it that  the inten∣tion of the said act of  R  was  NOT  that the King should grant a pardon for murder by express name in the charter but because the whole Parliament con∣ceived that he would never pardon Murder by special name for the causes aforesaid therefore was that pro∣vision made which was grounded  says he  upon the Law of God Quicunque effuderit humanum san∣guinem fundetur sanguis illius ad imaginem quippe Dei creatus est Homo  NEC ALITER EXPIARI POTEST NISI PER EJUS SANGUINEM  qui alterius sanguinem effuderit  Gen Num So that this learned Lawyer really resolves  THE INTENTION OF THE SAID ACT  into the doc∣trine of the  Divine Law  for which I contend viz  "that blood"  i e wilful murder  cannot be expiated but by the blood of the guilty  And happily the Act seems also to have been  effectual  to accomplish that  intention  for the learned Judge Blackstone after citing Sir Edward Coke's opinion that it was  NOT THE INTENTION  of the Parliament that the King should ever  PARDON MURDER  under these aggrava∣tions  c adds  "and it is remarkable enough"  says he  that there is  NO PRECEDENT OF A PAR∣DON  in the register for any homicide than that  which happens SE DEFENDENDO or PER INFORTUNIUM  And with respect to the determination of the Court of K B cited by Salkeld that  the King may par∣don on an indictment of murder  as well as the subject may discharge an appeal I observe that the force of the learned Judge Holt's argument for that doctrine rests on the repeal in R c of the restrictions and great difficulties which are put upon those that shall be suitors for  a pardon of murder  in this Act of R which said he  were found  GRIEVOUS TO THE SUBJECT  But that worthy and upright Judge would have acted on this point more like himself if he had previously examined the nature of the supposed  griev∣ance  whereby he would have known whether it was really  true  and  just  or only  fained  For if the alledged  "grievance to the subject"  was only an  unjust sugges∣tion  the whole Statute of  Repeal  as far as relates to this point is  null  and  void  for the  want of truth  as well as for being contrary to the d foundation of Eng∣lish law "for  contra veritatem nihil possumus  " and again  "contraveritatem lex nunquam aliquid permittit"  Inst Plowden c But above all the FATAL END of King Richard II should warn and deter all fu∣ture Monarchs from presuming to assert a PREROGA∣TIVE TO PARDON MURDER The illfated Mo∣narch by his ignorance of the nature of  Royal Preroga∣tive  in a  limited  or  politic government  prepared the way for his own destruction not considering that his  regality  had no foundation but the  law  and that his neglect of the latter did necessarily undermine the former which he afterwards severely experienced when compelled to deliver up both Crown and  Regality  with a public con∣fession of his own unworthiness to bear them And it is remarkable that the  murders  which had increased through his criminal indulgence were awefully retali∣ted afterwards in his own  blood  for at last he was himself also most cruelly and wickedly  murdered  con¦trary to the laws of God and man as if the  blood  which he had unjustly refused to  cleanse from the land  and  ex∣piate by the blood of the guilty  had fatally rested on his own head  that is to say where a man slayeth another  in his  own defence  or by  misfortune  Now with respect to the first case viz  "  in his own defence  " or  se defendendo  "all writers both antient and modern  agree that the killing of a man must  be  "It must be  inevitable necessity  " Pleas of the Crown p "upon  an inevitable cause  " d Inst chap p and  but care must be taken that the resistance does not exceed the bounds of  mere defence  and  prevention  for then the defender would himself become an aggressor  Blackstone "this is not excuseable  se defendendo  since there is no  absolute necessity

wall hedge c that his  necessitie  of defence may be esteemed alto∣gether  great and inevitable  c Lambard's Eiren c p See note in p  inevitable  and that the manstayer must be able to prove that he retired and that he was obliged  ex necessitate  to strike in order to save his own life a plea which cannot be admitted in fa∣vour of a Man who has accepted a challenge or who has drawn his sword in  sudden anger  merely to revenge an affront  And with respect to the second  par∣donable case  mentioned in the said act of Edw III viz  by Misfortune  I must ob∣serve that there are some cases of ho∣micide that may even be said to happen  by misfortune  or  without intention  which are nevertheless deemed  Murder  And the severity of the law in this respect will enable me by comparison to point out more clearly the absurdity and in∣justice of excusing homicide in consi∣deration  of sudden anger  when the mor∣tal stroke is given  with a weapon  in rencounters  The cases of  Misfortune or Accident  which are deemed  Murder  are those wherein the act which undesignedly occasions death is in itself  unlawful  For if the act be  unlawful  I mean if it be Ma∣lum in se the case will amount to felony either  murder  or  manslaughter  as circumstances may vary the na∣ture of it If it be done in prosecution of  a felonious intention  it will be  Murder  but if the intent went no further than to commit  a bare trespass manslaughter  Judge Foster p  Though I confess says he Lord Coke seemeth to think otherwise    If the act be  unlawful  says Lord Coke it is  murder  As if A meaning to steal a deer in the park of B shooteth at the deer and by the glance of the arrow killeth a boy that is hidden in a bush  this is murder  for that the act was  unlawful  although A  had no intent  to hurt the boy  nor knew not  of him  Inst Lord Chief Justice Holt indeed says it is but  manslaughter  in which he is mistaken  See note in ps and and Judge Holt's own opinion on another case quoted in p  See his Edition of Kelyng Rex versus Plummer But whether this be deemed  murder  or  manslaughter  the  killing  is merely accidental or by  mis∣fortune  and therefore is certainly a much less crime than that of aiming at  and striking a man  with a weapon  or shooting at him in  sudden anger  howso∣ever great the previous affront may have been For in the former case though the  shooting  at a  deer  belonging to an∣other person is both  unlawful  and  vo∣luntary  yet the  manslaughter  which it accidentally occasions is  involuntary  and without intention whereas in the  vo∣luntary  aiming and shooting at a man the act itself is not only  unlawful  but  implies malice  or rather I may say the  malice  is  expressed  by the act and the  sudden anger  is so far from being an  ex∣cuse  that it is absolutely a further proof of the  malice  and  intention  of  killing  The  malice  was also  implied  in the case of the Lord Dacres though his Lordship was not half so criminal in  his unlawful hunting  as the passionate man who strikes  with a weapon  See how the case is mentioned by Lord Chief Justice Kelyng Rep p published by Judge Holt  The Lord Dacres and Mansell and others in his company came  unlawfully  to hunt in a  forest  Judge Kelynge was mistaken in this point for the Lord Dacres probably would not have been treated with such severity if  the Trespass  had been in a  Forest  or open chace but it was in a  Park  belonging to Mr Pelham in Surry Crompton so that the  unlawful  Hunting was more than  a bare trespass  See note p and See also Hawkins cap xxxi § where another ground for the imputation of  Murder  in that case seems to be assigned viz a Resolution of Divers Persons to resist all opposers in the commission of  a breach of the peace  though it be only as he calls it  a bare breach  of the peace  and being resisted one of the company when the Lord Dacres was a great way off  and not present  killed a man judged  murder  in him  and all  the rest and the Lord Dacres  was hanged  Lord Chief Justice Holt supposes a case in his Rep of Rex versus Plummer p in the same book which is in some degree similar  So says he if  two men have a design to steal a hen and the one shoots  at the hen  for that purpose and  a man be killed  it is  murder  in both because the  design was felonious  See also the last para∣graph of p Inst concerning the shooting at a  tame fowl  of which this case supposed by Judge Holt is an ex∣planation But surely  the design  must be much more  felonious  when a man  wilfully  strikes his neighbour  with a weapon in sudden anger  because this must neces∣sarily be allowed to be an act  com∣mitted  felleo animo  with a  fell furi∣ous  and mischievous  mind  and  intent  which is Lambard's definition of  felony  c vii p  The  implication of malice  in the owner of a beast that kills a man after warn∣ing given will also further illustrate what has been said for though mere carelessness or inconsideration might oc∣casion  his neglect so that the accident may in some degree be esteemed a  misfortune  yet the law implies  malice  for if one keep a mastiff dog says Sir James Astry in his charge to grand juries p that is used to bite peo∣ple near the common highway or bull or beast that hath hurt any one after notice they kill any one  that will be murder in the Owner  although not present when the fact was done and yet in this and the other precedent cases here is no  express malice to be proved  but what the law construes to be so  this is agreeable to the doc∣trine of Judge Staunford P C lib i cap  Que si home ad un jument que est accustomé male faire et le Owner ceo bien sachant negliga luy eins suffra d'aller a large et puis le jument tua un home que ceo  est felo∣nie  in le owner eo que per tiel suf∣ferance  le owner semble d'aver volunté  a tuer  See also Crompton p b and Hawkins c xxxi § And according to Bracton the Common Law  imputes  the death of a man by a beast to any man who follows or drives the beast at the time of the misfortune  vel dum insequitur quis equum  vel bovem  et aliquis  a bove  vel  equo  per∣cussus fuerit et hujusmodi  hoc imputa∣tur ei  Bract lib iii c iv p b If this law were still enforced we should not have such continual complaints of accidents in the streets by cattle that are enraged and made mad through the cruelty of the twolegged brutes who drive them For the first step that ought to be taken in such cases is to seize  the drivers  and nineteen times out of twenty it will be found that the poor beast will recover itself when they are gone from the excess of fear and rage which the Brutality of the  hurrying  Drivers    Si quis operam rei dederit illicitae ut cum quis  Boves velociter fugaverit  quorum unus obviando hominem cornu occiderit  fugatori imputabitur  quia diligentiam quam potuit non adhibuit  Fleta lib i c xxiii p  had occasioned so that it is plain where the guilt is to be  imputed  but yet even  a brutal driver  is not so base and detestable as the man who wilfully strikes  with a weapon  in sudden anger And again he who aims to strike or shoot  at a man  and accidentally kills a  different person  whom perhaps he did not see contrary to his intention or  by misfortune  as it were is nevertheless deemed guilty of  wilful murder  though he had not the least  anger  or resentment against the  person killed  Homme sagitta a un  ex malicia praecogitata  et luy misse et tue autre qui estoit decost et a qui nad malice unc' il est  murder  eo que il  ad intent  de  mur∣der  Crompton's edition of Fitzherbert's Justice of Peace p  As if a man says Judge Holt out of malice to A shoots at him to kill him but misses him and kills B it is  no less  a  murder  than if he had killed the person intended  Lord ChiefJustice Holt's Rep of Rex versus Plummer in Kelyng's Rep p for which he quotes Dyer p Cromp p Plowden's Com p Saun∣ders's case Rep Agnes Gore's case  But surely the  man who  actually kills  the person  he aims at in his anger  is at least as culpable so that if  sudden anger  deserves no lenity in the former case it certainly deserves none in the latter Several cases also are mentioned by Sir William Blackstone wherein  sudden anger  is not excusable even though the death may be said to be  "by misfortune"  as there was no real  intention of killing yet rendered by the circumstances  equivalent to a deliberate act of slaughter  See Comment b iv chap xiv p and  Also if  even upon a sudden provocation  says he one beats another in a cruel and unusual manner so that he dies  though he did not intend his death  yet he is guilty of  murder  by an  express malice  that is by an  express  evil design  the genuine sense of  malitia  As when a parkkeeper tied a boy that was steal∣ing wood to a horse's tail and drag∣ged him along the park when a master corrected his servant with an  iron bar  and a schoolmaster stamped on his scholar's belly so that each of the sufferers died these were  justly held to be murders  because the cor∣rection being excessive and such as could not proceed but from a bad heart it  was equivalent to a deliberate act of slaughter  But is not  an express evil design  as apparent in the act of stri∣king a man with  a weapon in anger  be the  anger  ever so sudden as it is in these cases where death was  not really intended  For surely the  design of killing  is by the weapon rendered express  If one executes his revenge upon  a sudden provo∣cation  in such a cruel manner with a  dangerous wea∣pon  as shews a malicious and deliberate intent to do mischief and death ensues it is  express malice  from the nature of the fact and murder  Wood's Inst Book p And this must always be the case when men presume to decide their quarrels  with dan∣gerous weapons  be quarrels  ever so sudden and unpre∣meditated  for the  "malice"  is by the weapons  expressed  and the  "malice prepensed"  is therefore  im∣plied  "Ex telo praesumitur malum consilium" c See p  which equally  fulfils  "the genuine sense of malitia"  tho' perhaps the  prepensed malice  may more properly  upon a sudden provocation  as above be said to be  implied  than  express  But whether it be  express  or  implied  it undoubtedly constitutes  murder  for  malice  is the leading circumstance which distinguishes  manslaughter  from  murder  and therefore  an express evil design  such as is apparent in the  voluntary killing  of a man cannot be admitted under the head of  simple homicide  or  manslaughter  because the necessary difference is want∣ing  in the degree of the offence  according to the excellent rule before cited from  Sir Matthew Hale viz  murder being aggravated with  malice presumed or implied  but manslaughter  not  c  Hale P C  I may probably seem guilty of much tautology in this little Work but hope my Readers will excuse it in considera∣tion of the necessity I am under of re∣peatedly comparing the crimes of  stri∣king with a weapon  in  sudden Anger  and of  voluntary Killing  with so many other different cases wherein even  involuntary  and  accidental  Killing have been solemnly adjudged  Murder  and I apprehend that  the severity  of the Law in the last∣mentioned cases must sufficiently de∣monstrate such  a general abhorrence in our Law  to the shedding of  Human Blood  that we cannot reasonably sup∣pose  the same Law  capable of admitting an excuse for  voluntary Manslaughter  on  any private difference howsoever great the provocation Nevertheless Mr Hawkins ventures to assert a very dif∣ferent doctrine in his Pleas of the Crown Book c xxviii §  I see no reason says he why a person who without provocation is assaulted by another in any place whatsoever in such a manner as plainly shews an in∣tent to murder him as by discharg∣ing a Pistol or pushing at him with a drawn Sword c may not  justify Killing  such an Assailant as much as if he had attempted to rob him for is not he who attempts to Murder me says he more injurious than he who barely attempts to rob me And can it be more justifiable to fight for my goods than for my life And it is not only highly agreeable to reason that a man in such circumstances may  lawfully Kill  another but it seems  also to be confirmed by  the general Te∣nor of our Lawbooks  c  But howsoever specious this argument may appear I hope I have already proved  "by the general Tenor of our Lawbooks"  that the  Justifiable Kill∣ing  of a Man must be through  an inevita∣ble necessity  and therefore what Mr Hawkins afterwards advances in his comparison of such a case with Homi∣cide in  se Defendendo  cannot in the least justify either his opinion on that point or his assertion concerning  the general Tenor of the Lawbooks  He endeavours to represent  the Volun∣tary Killing  of a Man as  Justifiable Ho∣micide  and consequently he must sup∣pose it a less crime than  Excusable Ho∣micide  in  se Defendendo  He founds his opinion in the suppo∣sition of "some  precedent Quarrel  " in  the latter "in which" says he  both parties always are or at least may  justly be supposed  to have been in some fault so that the necessity to which a Man is at length reduced to kill another is in some measure presumed to be owing to himself  c  But may it not as  "justly be supposed"  that the person who  Kills  without  such necessity  is also  "in some fault"  Is not the  Presumption of Law  against him as I have elsewhere shewn by the  bloody  FACT when he cannot prove that  he endeavoured  at least to retreat in or∣der to avoid unnecessary bloodshed And is not FACT a more substantial ground for a criminal charge than any idea that a Court can possibly form con∣cerning the  Murderous Intentions  which  the Killer  may attribute to  the person Killed  The single circumstance that  the Killer  was under  no necessity  of endea∣vouring to retreat and avoid the assail∣ant is not only a proof that  his own in∣tentions  though he might not be the first aggressor were nearly as criminal as those he attributes to the  person Killed  but it also affords a strong presumption that  the latter  was not very strenuous or sanguine either in his attack or in his supposed  intention to commit murder  so that the very pretence by which Mr Hawkins endeavours to justify such a  voluntary Killing  must necessa∣rily fall to the ground whenever  the Killer  is unable to prove that he endea∣voured to avoid the attack  I have already made the necessary exceptions con∣cerning Civil Officers in the legal Execution of jus∣tice c  And tho' the Deceased might have had  a Wea∣pon Drawn  yet that circumstance affords no positive proof of his  criminal  intention  for he might have thought himself obliged to draw in his own de∣fence through a reciprocal suspicion of his adversary's  criminal intentions  and as he cannot plead his own cause it is reasonable that the Law should  pre∣sume  that he really did draw in his own defence especially as the circumstance that  the Killer  was under no necessity of endeavouring to avoid him affords a sufficient Ground for such  a presump∣tion  And even in cases where it may be supposed that the  person Killed  might really have had  "an intent to murder"  we ought to remember that the Laws of England do not punish men  merely  for their  "criminal intentions"  without some fact and therefore it would be highly absurd to suppose that the Law with∣out some apparent necessity would en∣trust every individual indiscriminately  with a supreme Authority which it de∣nies  even  to the Highest and most solemn Courts of Justice I mean an Authority to inflict capital punishment without a previous Trial  per pares  and that mere∣ly for  "a Criminal Intention"  which in many cases might as easily through fear passion or violent prejudice be mistaken or imaginary as be real  And therefore  an Assault upon the Person  is not as I have before in∣sisted in p against the opinion of Judge Foster  Provocation sufficient to free  the Party Killing  from the Guilt of Murder  The case of Gentlemen in the Army nevertheless seems peculiarly hard upon such unhappy occasions The first prin∣ciple of their profession is  Courage  and the World in general is too de∣praved to distinguish in what cases a  Man of  true Courage  may retreat  with honour  from the Assault of an Enemy so that Military Men are liable to be  unjustly  despised whenever they act  rea∣sonably  in cases either of insult or as∣sault  Yet at the same time it ought to be remembered that those men who sub∣mit to  the Slavish Yoke  of other Men's depraved opinions or unreasonable cus∣toms in contradiction to that  natural Knowledge  of  Good and Evil  which they inherit in common with the rest of Mankind from our first Parents can∣not  justly  be deemed  Men of Honour  and consequently are unworthy of  Rank  in the honourable Profession of Arms And though such men may support an outward  appearance  of  Cour∣age  in the eye of the world by  daring  to violate the Laws of God and Man in  private  Quarrels yet that very act af∣fords  the most manifest token of the Want of  real  and  steady Courage  for unless the submission to that depraved custom can be attributed to  inconsidera∣tion or  to  the want of Knowledge  it must necessarily be supposed that the  Duellist had not sufficient Courage  to as∣sert his  natural Right  of Acting agreea∣ble to the Dictates of his  own reason and conscience  and was  unable to face the Terrors  of  an  adverse Fortune  in a good Cause  and therefore like a wretched  Coward  he yielded himself a prisoner and slave to the fashionable Depravity  I am far from meaning however to charge all Soldiers with Cowardice that have fought Duels sometimes Passion and false Pride but more frequently in∣consideration and ignorance of the Laws of God and Man as I have before hint∣ed occasion the base submission and conformity to those  false  and  unreasona∣ble  notions of Honour  which almost uni∣versally prevail  Nor do I so much blame  the Military Gentlemen  for this unnatural depravity as I do  the Professors of the Law  who ought to have set them a better exam∣ple and yet have rather contributed to  the ignorance of the times  by the many  gross perversions  of  our Law  which they have admitted into the Books Gen∣tlemen of the Army are not obliged in∣deed to acquire a critical knowledge of the Law but they must not forget that they are  Men  as well as  Soldiers  and that if they do not maintain the Natural Privilege of  Men  viz that of thinking for themselves and acting agreeable to the Dictates of their  own Conscience  as Members of the Commu∣nity they are unfit for  British Soldiers  of whom the  Law  requires an acknow∣ledgement of  her supremacy  For the Law will not excuse an  un∣lawful Act  by a Soldier even though he commits it by  the express Command  of the highest military Authority in the Kingdom and much less is the Sol∣dier obliged to conform himself  impli∣citly  to the mere opinions and false No∣tions of Honour which his Superiors may have unfortunately adoptedEven in publick military Service or warlike Expeditions by  National authority  the Law manifestly requires the Soldier  to think for himself  and to consider be∣fore he acts in any war whether the same be  just  for if it be otherwise the Common Law of this Kingdom will  impute  to him  the Guilt  of  Murder  And though the Law does not actually punish such general Crimes as may un∣fortunately have obtained at any time the Sanction of Government yet the time will certainly come when all such  temporizing military  Murderers  must be responsible for the innocent blood that is shed in an  unjust  War if they have rendered themselves  accessaries to it by an implicit  and therefore  criminal  obe∣dience to the promoters of it  Item fit Homicidium  in Bello  says the learned Bracton  et tunc videndum utrum  Bellum  sit  justum  vel  injustum  Si autem  injustum  tenebitur occisor si autem  justum  sicut  pro defensione patriae  non tenebitur nisi hoc  fecerit corrupta voluntate et intentione  Bracton Lib c  de Corona  p  Men of  true honour  therefore at the same time that they are sensible of their duty as  Soldiers  and  Subjects  to their King must be mindful that they are  subject also to the empire of reason  and are bound thereby in common with all mankind to maintain the  dignity  and  natural freedom  of Human Nature and  those Soldiers who in addition to their  natural reason  have a true sense of  Reli∣gion  will not only be mindful that they are Soldiers and Subjects to an earthly King but that they are also  Soldiers  and  Subjects  to  the King of Kings  whose Laws and precepts they will on all occasions prefer  to every other Com∣mand  and will obey the same with such a  steady courage  as may be equal to every adversity and undeserved suffering that threatens them  This doctrine is censured by a Critic in the Monthly Review for Jan who calls it  "a strange Princi∣ple"  In an age of Infidelity indeed it may perhaps be allowed in one sense to be  "a strange principle"  but then we have the greatest reason to lament the igno∣rance and depravity of those men who esteem it so in any other sense than that of being  too often  neglected and transgressed For I trust that no man who admits or believes the divine authority of the Holy Scriptures will doubt the  truth of it  If this  "strange principle"  had not been equally  true  the English nation would long ago have been  enslaved  and even the very  standing Army  itself would by this time have been reduced to that  abject state  of  political slavery  which disgraces the  standing Armies  of unlimited Monarchies and renders them very truly the  "Abomination of Desolation"  and the  Belluina Potestas  or  power of the Beast  against which the vengeance of the  Almighty  is denounced in the Holy Scriptures See a Note on the word  command  or  imperium  in p of my Tract on the  Means of national Defence by a free Militia  It was this indispensible this happy disposition and sense of  superior duty  which prevailed even in an unlawful standing Army that had been  raised  and was  expressly designed  for arbitrary purposes and which nevertheless con∣trary to all expectation exerted itself in saving this Kingdom at the Glori∣ous Revolution from the Political Slavery which then threatened it as well as from the more intolerable Tyranny of the Romish Religion  The Soldier therefore who has not  Courage enough  to profess on all occa∣sions  a strict obedience to the  Laws of his Country  according to the dictates of his  own reason  and  Conscience in prefer∣ence to every command and every other opinion whatever  is unworthy of the British military service being qualified rather to be inlisted with the slavish Troops of  absolute  Monarchs or to serve in the Black Banditti of the Emperor of Morocco  But I must return once more to the opinions of  the Professors of Law    it is said  This opinion is in the true stile of a  Tradition  such as those by which the Jews of old  "perverted the Law"  that if he who draws upon another  in a sudden Quarrel  make no pass at him  till his sword is drawn  and then fight with him and  Kill him  is guilty of  Manslaughter  only  c Hawkins Pleas of the Crown cxxxi § for which he quotes Kelynge  and but  the pretence  for this indulgence is as  frivolous  as the Doctrine is  false  viz "because says Mr Haw∣kins  that by neglecting the opportu∣nity of Killing the other before he was on his guard and in a condition to defend himself with like Hazard to both he shewed that his  intent  was not so much to  kill  as to  combat  with the other in compliance with those  common notions of Honour  cBut is not  "the intent to kill"  or to do some bodily harm and certainly at least the Risque of  Killing  included in the  intention "to Combat" with dangerous weapons  And is it  Justice  Nay is it  common Sense  to excuse a  Notorious Crime  by the Plea of an  intention  to commit  another Crime  almost as bad  I have already shewn by fair com∣parison with a variety of cases that the crime of  wilfully striking  or  Combating  with weapons in sudden Anger  is a much more  unlawful act  than many others wherein even  involuntary and accidental Homicide  has been solemnly adjudged  Murder  and has been generally admitted as such by the Sages of our Law in their Reports and it will therefore be highly disgraceful to our Law but more parti∣cularly because  deservedly  to the pro∣fessors of it if they should still persist in the  unreasonable  and  unjust  practice of pu∣nishing  lesser  Crimes with  more  severity than the  crying Sin  of  voluntary Man∣slaughter  which as I have already proved in my preface is absolutely  un∣pardonable in this World  by the Laws
