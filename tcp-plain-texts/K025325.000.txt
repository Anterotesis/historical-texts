SERVANTS  By HUGH KELLY  LONDON PRINTED FOR R BALDWIN No PATERNOSTERROW W JOHNSTON No and G KEARSLY No in LUDGATESTREET M DCC LXVIII  TO DAVID GARRICK Esq  Dear SIR  I HAVE two motives for inscribing this piece to you gratitude and vanity gratitude because it's success has been greatly owing to your judicious advice and vanity because I wish to acquaint the world that such a character as  Mr Garrick  has been warmly the friend of his sincerely affectionate  And very much obliged Humble Servant  HUGH KELLY  Middle Temple  Jan  PROLOGUE  Written by DAVID GARRICK Esq  Mr Kelly originally intended the prologue to be grave and accordingly wrote a serious one himself but as Mr King was to speak it Mr Garrick with great propriety thought a piece of humour would be best suited to the talents of that excellent actor and therefore very kindly took the trouble of putting it into a form so entirely different from the first that it cannot with the least justice be attributed to any other author  Spoken by Mr KING  I'M vex'dquite vex'd and you'll be vex'dthat's worse  To deal with  stubborn scribblers  there's the curse  Write  moral  plays the blockhead why good people  You'll soon expect this house to wear a steeple  For our fine piece to let you into facts  Is quite a  Sermon  only preach'd in  Acts  You'll scarce believe me 'till the proof appears  But even I Tom Fool must shed some tears  Do Ladies lock upon me nay no simp'ring  Think you this face was ever made for whimp'ring  Can I a cambrick handkerchief display  Thump my unfeeling breast and roar away  Why  this  is  comical  perhaps he'll say  Resolving this strange aukward bard to pump  I ask'd him what he meant He somewhat plump  New purs'd his belly and his lips thus biting  I must keep up the dignity of writing  You may but if you do Sir I must tell ye  You'll not keep up that dignity of belly  Still he preach'd on "  Bards of a former age  Held up abandon'd pictures on the stage  Spread out their wit with facinating art  And catch'd the fancy to corrupt the heart  But happy change in these more moral days  You cannot sport with virtue even in plays  On virtue's side his pen the poet draws  And boldly asks a hearing for his cause"  Thus did he prance and swell The man may prate  And feed these whimsies in his addle pate  That you'll protect his muse because she's good  A virgin

 Or should his brain be turn'd with wild pretences  In three hours time you'll bring him to his senses  And well you may when in your power you get him  In that short space you blister bleed and sweat

Reynolds  SCENE  Richmond  TIME  The Time of Representation  FALSE DELICACY  ACT I SCENE I  An Apartment at  Lady BETTY LAMBTON'S  Enter  SIDNEY  and  WINWORTH  SIDNEY  STILL I can't help thinking but Lady Betty Lambton's refusal was infinitely more the result of an extraordinary delicacy than the want of affection for your Lordship  WINWORTH  O my dear cousin you are very much mistaken I am not one of those coxcombs who imagine a woman does'nt know her own mind or who because they are treated with civility by a lady who has rejected their addresses suppose she is secretly debating in their favour Lady Betty is a woman of sense and must consequently despise coquetry or affectation  SIDNEY  Why she always speaks of you with the greatest respect  WINWORTH  Respect Why she always speaks of you with the greatest respect does it therefore follow that she loves you No Charles I have for some time you know ceas'd to trouble Lady Betty with my solicitations and I see myself honour'd with her friendship though I hav'nt been so happy as to merit her heart for this reason I have no doubt of her assistance on the present occasion and I am certain I shall please her by making my addresses to Miss Marchmont  SIDNEY  Miss Marchmont is indeed a very deserving young woman  WINWORTH  Next to Lady Betty I never saw one so form'd to my wishes besides during the whole period of my fruitless attendance she seemed so interested for my success and express'd so hearty a concern for my disappointment that I have consider'd her with an eye of more than common friendship ever since But what's the matter with you Charles you seem to have something upon your spirits  SIDNEY  Indeed my Lord you are mistaken I am only attentive  WINWORTH  O is that all This very day I purpose to request Lady Betty's interest with Miss Marchmont for unhappily circumstanc'd as she is with regard to fortune she possesses an uncommon share of delicacy and may possibly think herself  insulted by the offer of a rejected heart Lady Betty in that case will save her the pain of a supposed disrespect and me the mortification of a new repulse But I beg your pardon Charles I am forgetting the cause of friendship and shall now step up stairs to Colonel Rivers about your affair Ah Sidney you have no difficulties to obstruct the completion of your wishes and a few days must make you one of the happist men in England  Exit  SIDNEY  looking after him  A few days make me one of the happiest men in England a likely matter truly little does he know how I passionately admire the very woman to whom he is immediately going with an offer of his person and fortune The marriage with Miss Rivers I see is unavoidable and I am almost pleased that I never obtained any encouragement from Miss Marchmont as I should now be reduc'd to the painful alternative either of giving up my own hopes or of opposing the happiness of such a friend  Enter  Mrs HARLEY  and  Miss MARCHMONT  Mrs HARLEY  O here my dear girl is the sweet swain in  propria persona  Only mind what a funeral sermonface the creature has notwithstanding the agreeable prospects before him Well of all things in the world defend me I say from a sober husband  SIDNEY  You are extreamly welcome Mrs Harley to divert yourself  Mrs HARLEY  He speaks too in as melancholy a tone as a passing bell Lord lord what can Colonel Rivers see in the wretch to think of him for a soninlaw Only look Miss Marchmont at this loveexciting countenance Observe the Cupids that ambush in these eyes These lips to be sure are fraught with the honey of Hybla Go you lifeless devil you go try to get a little animation into this unfortunate face of yours  SIDNEY  Upon my word my face is very much oblig'd to you  Miss MARCHMONT  You are a mad creature my dear and yet I envy your spirits prodigiously  Mrs HARLEY  And so you ought But for all that you and Lady Betty are unaccountably fond of those halfsoul'd fellows who are as mechanically regular as so many pieces of clockwork and never strike above once an hour upon a new observation who are so sentimental and so dull so wise and so drowsy Why I thought Lady Betty had already a sufficient quantity of lead in her family without taking in this lump to increase the weight of it  Miss MARCHMONT  What can she posibly mean Mr Sidney  SIDNEY  'Tis impossible to guess madam The lively widow will still have her laugh without sparing any body  Mrs HARLEY  Why surely my dear you can't forget the counter part of poor dismal here that elaborate piece of dignified dulness Lady Betty's cousin Lord Hectic who through downright fondness is continually plaguing his poor wife and rendering her the most miserable woman in the world from an extraordinary desire of promoting her happiness  Miss MARCHMONT  And is'nt there a great deal to say in extenuation of an error which proceeds from a principle of real affection  Mrs HARLEY  Affection ridiculous but you shall have an instance of this wonderful affection T'other day I din'd at his house and though the weather was intollerably warm the table was laid in a close room with a fire large enough to roast an ox for a country corporation  SIDNEY  Well and so  Mrs HARLEY  In a great chair near the fire side sat poor Lady Hectic wrapp'd up in as many fur cloaks as would bassle the severity of a winter in Siberia On my entrance I express'd a proper concern for her illness and ask'd the nature of her complaint She told me she complain'd of nothing but the weight of her dress and the intollerable heat of the apartment adding that she had been caught in a little shower the preceding  evening which terrisied Lord Hectic out of his wits and so for fear she might run the chance of a slight cold he exposed her to the hazard of absolute suffocation  SIDNEY  Upon my word Miss Marchmont she has a pretty manner of turning things  Miss MARCHMONT  Really I think so  Mrs HARLEY  Well unable to bear either the tyranny of this preposterous fondness any longer or the intollerable heat of his room I made my escape the moment the cloth was removed and shan't be surprised if before the conclusion of the summer he is brought before his peers for having murdered his poor lady out of downright affection  SIDNEY  A very uncommon death Mrs Harley among people of quality  Enter a  FOOTMAN  FOOTMAN  to  SIDNEY  Lord Winworth Sir desires the favour of your company above the person is come with the writings from the Temple  SIDNEY  I'll wait upon him immediately  Mrs HARLEY  Ay pray do you are the fittest company in the world for each other If Colonel Rivers was of my mind he'd turn you instantly adrift and listen to the overtures of Sir Harry Newburg  SIDNEY  I really believe you have a fancy to me yourself you're so constantly abusing me  Exit  Mrs HARLEY  I you odious creature  Miss MARCHMONT  Now you mention Sir Harry my dear is'nt it rather extraordinary for him to think about Miss Rivers when he knows of the engagements between her and Mr Sidney especially as her father has such an objection to the wildness of his character  Mrs HARLEY  What you are still at your sober reflections I see and are for scrutinizing into the morals of a loverThe women truly would have a fine time of it if they were never to be married till they found men of unexceptionable characters  Miss MARCHMONT  Nay I don't want to lessen Sir Harry's merit in the least he has his good qualities as well as his faults and is no way destitute of understanding but still his understanding is a fashionable one and pleads the knowledge of every thing right to justify the practice of many things not strictly warrantable  Mrs HARLEY  Why I never heard any thing to his prejudice but some fashionable liberties which he has taken with the ladies  Miss MARCHMONT  And in the name of wonder what wou'd you desire to hear  Mrs HARLEY  Come come Hortensia we women are unaccountable creatures the greatest number of us by much love a fellow for having a little modish wildness about him and if we are such fools as to be captivated with the vices of the men we ought to be punished for the depravity of our sentiments  Enter  RIVERS  and  Lady BETTY  RIVERS  I tell you sister they can read the parchments very well without our assistance and I have been so fatigu'd with looking over papers all the morning that I am heartily sick of your Indentures witnessing your forasmuch's likewise's also's moreover's and notwithstanding's and I must take a turn in the garden to recover myself  Exit  Lady BETTY  Nay I only spoke because I imagin'd our being present would be more agreeable to Lord Winworth But I wonder Sir Harry does'nt come he promised to be here by ten and I want to see his cousin Cecil mightily  Miss MARCHMONT  What Lady Betty does Mr Cecil come with him here this morning  Lady BETTY  He does my dear he arrived at Sir Harry's last night and I want to see if his late journey to France has any way improved the elegance of his appearance  ironically  Mrs HARLEY  Well I shall be glad to see him too for notwithstanding his disregard of dress and freedom of manner there is a something right in him that pleases me prodigiously  Miss MARCHMONT  A something right Mrs Harley he is one of the worthiest creatures in the world  Lady BETTY  O Hortensia he ought to be a favourite of yours for I don't know any body who possesses a higher place in his good opinion  Miss MARCHMONT  'Twou'd be odd indeed if he was'nt a favourite of mine he was my father's best friend gave him a considerable living you know and when he died wou'd have provided very kindly for me if your generosity Lady Betty had'nt render'd his goodness wholly unnecessary  Lady BETTY  Pooh Pooh no more of this  Mrs HARLEY  wish there was a possibility of making him dress like a gentleman But I am glad he comes  with Sir Harry for though they have a great regard for each other they are continually wrangling and form a contrast which is often extremely diverting  Enter a Footman  Sir Harry Newburg and Mr Cecil Madam  Lady BETTY  O here they are Shew them in  Exit Footm  Mrs HARLEY  Now for it  Miss MARCHMONT  Hush they are here  Sir HARRY  Ladies your most obedient  CECIL  Ah Girls give me a kiss each of you instantly Lady Betty I am heartily glad to see you I have a budget full of compliments for you from several of your friends at Paris  Lady BETTY  Did you meet any of them at Paris  CECIL  I did and what was worse I met them in every town I passed through but the English are a great commercial nation you know and their fools like their broad cloths are exported in large quantities to all parts of Europe  Sir HARRY  What and they found you a fool so much above the market price that they have returned you upon the hands of your country Here ladies is a head for you piping hot from Paris  CECIL  And here ladies is a head for you like the Alps  Sir HARRY  Like the Alps ladies How do you make that out  CECIL  Why it's always white and always barren 'tis constantly covered with snow but never produces any thing profitable  Mrs HARLEY  O say no more upon that head I beseech you  Lady BETTY  Indeed Sir Harry I think they're too hard for you  Mrs HARLEY  Why I think so too especially my friend Cecil who with that unfortunate shock of hair has no great right to be considered as a standard for dress in this country  CECIL  Ah widow there are many heads in this country with much more extraordinary things upon them than my unfortunate shock of hair as you call it what do you think of these wings for instance that cover the ears of my cousin Mercury  Sir HARRY  Death don't spoil my hair  CECIL  You see this fellow is so tortur'd upon the wheel of fashion that a single touch immediately throws him into agonies now my dress is as easy as it's simple and five minutes  Sir HARRY  With the help of your five fingers equips you at any time for the drawingroom ha ha ha  CECIL  And is'nt it better than being five hours under the paws of your hairdresser  Lady BETTY  But custom Mr Cecil  CECIL  Men of sense have nothing to do with custom and 'tis more their business to set wise examples than to follow foolish ones  Mrs HARLEY  But don't you think the world will be apt to laugh a little Mr Cecil  CECIL  I can't help the want of understanding among mankind  Sir HARRY  The blockhead thinks there's nothing due to the general opinion of one's country  CECIL  And none but blockheads like you would mind the foolish opinions of any country  Lady BETTY  Well Mr Cecil must take his own way I think so come along ladies let us go into the ga  den and send my brother to Sir Harry to settle the business about Theodora  CECIL  Theodora what a charming name for the romance of a circulating library I wonder Lady Betty your brother wou'd'nt call his girl Deborah after her grandmother  Mrs HARRLEY  Deborah O I should hate such an old fashioned name abominably  CECIL  And I hate this new fashion of calling our children by pompous appellations By and by we shan't have a Ralph or a Roger a Bridget or an Alice remaining in the kingdom The dregs of the people have adopted this unaccountable custom and a fellow who keeps a little alehouse at the bottom of my avenue in the country has no less than an AugustusFrederick a Scipio Africanus and a MatildaWilhelminaLeonora in his family  Mrs HARLEY  Upon my word a very pretty string of christian names  Lady BETTY  Well Sir Harry you and Mr Cecil dine with us Come ladies let us go to the garden  Mrs HARLEY  I positively won't go without Mr Cecil for I must have somebody to laugh at  CECIL  And so must I widow therefore I won't lose this opportunity of being in your company    Exeunt ladies and followed by  CECIL  who meets  RIVERS  entering    CECIL  Ah Colonel I am heartily glad to see you  RIVERS  My dear Cecil you are welcome home again  CECIL  There's my wise kinsman wants a word with you  Exit  Sir HARRY  Colonel your most obedient I am come upon the old business for unless I am allow'd to entertain hope of Miss Rivers I shall be the most miserable of human beings  RIVERS  Sir Harry I have already told you by letter and I now tell you personally I cannot listen to your proposals  Sir HARRY  No Sir  RIVERS  No Sir I have promised my daughter to Mr Sidney do you know that Sir  Sir HARRY  I do but what then Engagements of this kind you know  RIVERS  So then you do know I have promised her to Mr Sidney  Sir HARRY  I do but I also know that matters are not finally settled between Mr Sidney and you and I moreover know that his fortune is by no means equal to mine therefore  RIVERS  Sir Harry let me ask you one question before you make your consequence  Sir HARRY  A thousand if you please Sir  RIVERS  Why then Sir let me ask you what you have ever observed in me or my conduct that you desire me so familiarly to break my word I thought Sir you considered me as a man of honour  Sir HARRY  And so I do Sir a man of the nicest honour  RIVERS  And yet Sir you ask me to violate the sanctity of my word and tell me indirectly that it is my interest to be a rascal  Sir HARRY  I really don't understand you Colonel I thought when I was talking to you I was talking to a man who knew the world and as you have not yet signed  RIVERS  Why this is mending matters with a witness And so you think because I am not legally bound I am under no necessity of keeping my word Sir Harry laws were never made for men of honour they want no bond but the  rectitude of their own sentiments and laws are of no use but to bind the villains of society  Sir HARRY  Well but my dear Colonel if you have no regard for me shew some little regard for your daughter  RIVERS  Sir Harry I shew the greatest regard for my daughter by giving her to a man of honour and I must not be insulted with any farther repetition of your proposals  Sir HARRY  Insult you Colonel is the offer of my alliance an insult is my readiness to make what settlements you think proper  RIVERS  Sir Harry I should consider the offer of a kingdom an insult if it was to be purchased by the violation of my word Besides though my daughter shall never go a beggar to the arms of her husband I wou'd rather see her happy than rich and if she has enough to provide handsomely for a young family and something to spare for the exigencies of a worthy friend I shall think her as affluent as if she was mistress of Mexico  Sir HARRY  Well Colonel I have done but I believe  RIVERS  Well Sir Harry and as our conference is done we will if you please retire to the ladies I shall be always glad of your acquaintance though I can't receive you as a soninlaw for a union of interest I look upon as a union of dishonour and consider a marriage for money at best but a legal prostitution  Exeunt  End of the first  ACT  ACT II  SCENE  a Garden  Enter  Lady BETTY  and  Mrs HARLEY  Mrs HARLEY  LORD Lord my dear you're enough to drive one out of one's wits I tell you again and again he's as much yours as ever and was I in your situation he shou'd be my husband tomorrow morning  Lady BETTY  Dear Emmy you mistake the matter strangely Lord Winworth is no common man nor wou'd he have continued his silence so long upon his favourite subject if he had the least inclination to renew his addresses His pride has justly taken the alarm at my insensibility and he will not I am satisfied run the hazard of another refusal  Mrs HARLEY  Why then in the name of wonder if he was so dear to you cou'd you prodigally trifle with your own happiness and repeatedly refuse him  Lady BETTY  I have repeatedly told you because I was a fool Emmy Till he withdrew his addresses I knew not how much I esteemed him my unhappiness in my first marriage you know made me resolve against another And you are also sensible I have frequently argued that a woman of real delicacy shou'd never admit a second impression on her heart  Mrs HARLEY  Yes and I always thought you argued very foolishly I am sure I ought to know for I have been twice married and though I lov'd my first husband very sincerely there was not a woman in England who cou'd have made the second a better wife Nay for that matter if another was to offer himself tomorrow I am not altogether certain that I should refuse listening  Lady BETTY  You are a strange creature  Mrs HARLEY  And are'nt you a much stranger in declining to follow your own inclinations when you cou'd have consulted them so highly to the credit of your good sense and the satisfaction of your whole family But it is'nt yet too late and if you will be advised by me every thing shall end as happily as you can wish  Lady BETTY  Well let me hear your advice  Mrs HARLEY  Why this then My Lord you know has requested that you wou'd indulge him with half an hour's private conversation some time this morning  Lady BETTY  Well  Mrs HARLEY  This is a liberty he has'nt taken these three months and he must design something by it now as he can design nothing but to renew his addresses I wou'd advise you to take  him at the very first word for fear your delicacy if it has time to consider shou'd again shew you the strange impropriety of second marriages  Lady BETTY  But suppose this should not be his business with me  Mrs HARLEY  Why then we'll go another way to work I as a sanguine friend of my Lord's can give him a distant hint of matters exacting at the same time a promise of the most inviolable secrecy and assuring him you wou'd never forgive me if you had the least idea of my having acquainted him with so important a  Lady BETTY  And so you wou'd have me  Mrs HARLEY  Why not This is the very step I shou'd take myself if I was in your situation  Lady BETTY  May be so But it's a step which I shall never take What wou'd you have me lost to all feeling Wou'd you have me meanly make use of chambermaid artifices for a husband  Mrs HARLEY  I would only have you happy my dear And where the man of one's heart is at stake I don't think we ought to stand so rigidly upon trifles  Lady BETTY  Trifles Emmy do you call the laws of delicacy trifles She that violates these  Mrs HARLEY  Poh poh she that violates What a work there is with you sentimental folks Why don't I tell you that my Lord shall never know any thing of your concern in the design  Lady BETTY  But sha'nt I know it myself Emmy and how can I escape the justice of my own reflections  Mrs HARLEY  Well thank heav'n my sentiments are not sufficiently refin'd to make me unhappy  Lady BETTY  I can't change my sentiments my dear Emmy nor wou'd I if I cou'd Of this however be certain that unless I have Lord Winworth without courting him I shall never have him at all But be silent to all the world upon this matter I conjure you Particularly to Miss Marchmont for she has been so strenuous an advocate for my Lord that the concealment of it from her might give her some doubts of my friendship and I shou'd be continually uneasy for fear my reserve shou'd be consider'd as an indirect insult upon her circumstances  Mrs HARLEY  Well the devil take this delicacy I don't know any thing it does besides making people miserable And yet some how foolish as it is one can't help liking it But yonder I see Sir Harry and Mr Cecil  Lady BETTY  Let us withdraw then my dear they may detain us and 'till this interview is over I shall  be in a continual agitation yet I am strangely apprehensive of a disappointment Emmy and if  going  Mrs HARLEY  Lady Betty  Lady BETTY  What do you say  Mrs HARLEY  Do you still think there is any thing extremely preposterous in second marriages  Lady BETTY  You are intolerably provoking  Exeunt  Enter  CECIL  and  Sir HARRY  CECIL  Well did'nt I tell you the moment you opened this affair to me that the Colonel was a man of too much sense to give his daughter to a coxcomb  Sir HARRY  But what if I should tell you that his daughter shall be still mine and in spite of his teeth  CECIL  Prithee explain kinsman  Sir HARRY  Why suppose Miss Rivers should have no very strong objection to this unfortunate figure of mine  CECIL  Why even your vanity can't think that a young lady of her good sense can possibly be in love with you  Sir HARRY  What you think that no likely circumstance I see  CECIL  I do really Formerly indeed the women were fools enough to be caught by the frippery of externals and so a fellow neither picked a pocket nor put up with an affront he was a dear toad a sweet creature and a wicked devil nay the wicked devil was quite an angel of a man and like another Alexander in proportion to the number of wretches which he made he constantly increased the lustre of his reputation till at last having conquered all his worlds he sat down with that celebrated ruffian and wept because he cou'd commit no farther outrages upon society  Sir HARRY  O my good moralizing cousin you'll find your self cursedly out in your politics and I shall convince you in a few hours that a handsome suit on the back of a sprightly young fellow will still do more among the women than all your sentiment and slovenliness  CECIL  What wou'd you persuade me that Miss Rivers will go off with you  Sir HARRY  You have hit the mark for once in your life my sweet temper'd mouther of morality The dear Theodora  CECIL  The dear Theodora and so Harry you imagine that by the common maxims of fashionable  life you may appear to be a friend to the Colonel at the very moment you are going to rob him of his daughter For shame kinsman for shame have some pride if you have no virtue and dont smile in a man's face when you want to do him the greatest of all injuries dont Harry  Sir HARRY  Cecil I scorn a base action as much as you or as much as any man but I love Miss Rivers honourably I ask nothing from her father and as her person is her own she has a right to bestow it where she pleases  CECIL  I am answered her person is her own and she has a right to be miserable her own way I acknowledge it and will not discover your secret to her father  Sir HARRY  Discover it to her father why sure you woud'nt think of it Take care Cecil take care I do indeed love you better than any man in the world and I know you have a friendship a cordial friendship for me but the happiness of my whole life is at stake and must not be destroyed by any of your unaccountable peculiarities  CECIL  Harry you know I wou'd at any time rather promote your happiness than obstruct it And you also know that if I die without children you shall have a principal part of my fortune but damn it I wish you had not used the mask of friendship to steal this young Lady away from her relations 'tis hard that their good nature  must be turned against their peace and hard because her whole family treat you with regard that you should offer them the greatest insult imaginable  Sir HARRY  Dear Cecil I am more to be pitied than condemned in this transaction when I first endeavoured to make myself agreeable to Miss Rivers I imagined her family would readily countenance my addresses and when I succeeded in that endeavour I had not time to declare myself in form before her father entred into this engagement with Sidney The moment I heard it mentioned I wrote to him offering him a  carte blanche  and this morning a repetition of my offer was treated with contempt I have therefore been forc'd into the measure you disapprove so much but I hope my conduct in the character of the soninlaw will amply atone for any error in my behaviour as a friend  CECIL  Well well we must make the best of a bad market her father has no right to force her inclinations 'tis equally cruel and unjust therefore you may depend upon my utmost endeavours not only to assist you in carrying her off but in appeasing all family resentments For really you are so often in the wrong that one must stand by you a little when you are in the right so I shall be ready for you kinsman  Sir HARRY  Why Cecil this is honest this is really friendly and you shall abuse me a whole twelvemonth without my answering a syllable  but for the present I must leave you yonder I see Miss Rivers we have some little matters to talk of you understand me and now  Exit  CECIL  For a torrent of rapture and nonsense What egregious puppies does this unaccountable love make of young fellows Nay for that matter what egregious puppies does it not make of old ones  ecce signum  'Tis a comfort though that no body knows I am a puppy in this respect but myself Here was I fancying that all the partiality I felt for poor Hortensia Marchmont proceeded from my friendship for her father when upon an honest examination into my own heart I find it principally arises from my regard for herself I was in hopes a change of objects would have driven the baggage out of my thoughts and I went to France but I am come home with a settled resolution of asking her to marry a slovenly rascal of fifty who is to be sure a very likely swain for a young lady to fall in love with but who knows the most sensible women have sometimes strange tastes and yet it must be a very strange taste that can possibly approve of my overtures I'll go cautiously to work however and solicit her as for a friend of my own age and fortune so that if she refuses me which is probable enough I shan't expose myself to her contempt What a ridiculous figure is an old fool sighing at the feet of a young woman Zounds I wonder how the greyheaded dotards have the impudence to ask a blooming girl of twenty to throw herself away upon a moving mummy or a walking skeleton  Exit  The  SCENE  changes to an Apartment in  Lady BETTY's  House  Enter  Lady BETTY  and  Mrs HARLEY  Lady BETTY  You can't think Emmy how my spirits are agitated I wonder what my Lord can want with me  Mrs HARLEY  Well well try and collect yourself a little he is just coming up I must retire Courage my dear creature this once and the day's our own I warrant you  Exit  Enter  WINWORTH  bowing very low  Lady BETTY  Here he is Bless me what a flutter I am in  WINWORTH  Your Ladyship's most obedient  Lady BETTY  Won't your Lordship be seated He seems excessively confus'd  aside  WINWORTH  I have taken the liberty Madam How she awes me now I am alone with her  aside  Lady BETTY  My Lord  WINWORTH  I say Madam I have taken the liberty to  Lady BETTY  I beg my Lord you won't consider an apology in the least  WINWORTH  Your Ladyship is extremely obliging and yet I am fearful  Lady BETTY  I hope your Lordship will consider me as a friend and therefore lay aside this unnecessary ceremony  WINWORTH  I do consider you Madam as a friend as an inestimable friend and I am this moment come to solicit you upon a subject of the utmost importance to my happiness  Lady BETTY  aside  Lord what is he going to say  WINWORTH  Madam  Lady BETTY  I say my Lord that you cannot speak to me on any subject of importance without engaging my greatest attention  WINWORTH  You honour me too much Madam  Lady BETTY  Not in the least my Lord for there is not a person in the world who wishes your happiness with greater cordiality  WINWORTH  You eternally oblige me Madam and I can now take courage to tell you that my happiness in a most material degree depends upon your Ladyship  Lady BETTY  On me my Lord Bless me  WINWORTH  Yes Madam on your Ladyship  Lady BETTY  aside  Mrs Harley was right and I shall sink with confusion  WINWORTH  'Tis on this business Madam I have taken the liberty of requesting the present interview and as I find your Ladyship so generously ready  Lady BETTY  Why my Lord I must confess I say I must acknowledge my Lord that if your happiness depends upon me I should not be very much pleas'd to see you miserable  WINWORTH  Your Ladyship is benignity itself but as I want words to express my sense of this obligation I shall proceed at once to my request nor trespass upon your patience by an ineffectual compliment to your generosity  Lady BETTY  If you please my Lord  WINWORTH  Then Madam my request is that I may have your consent  Lady BETTY  This is so sudden my Lord so unexpected  WINWORTH  Why Madam it is so yet if I cou'd but engage your acquiescence I might still think of a double union on the day which makes my cousin happy  Lady BETTY  My Lord I really don't know how to answer Does'nt your Lordship think this is rather precipitating matters  WINWORTH  No man Madam can be too speedy in promoting his happiness If therefore I might presume to hope for your concurrence I woud'nr altogether  Lady BETTY  My concurrence my Lord since it is so essentially necessary to your peace I cannot refuse any longer Your great merit will justify so immediate a compliance and I shall stand excused of all  WINWORTH  Then Madam I don't despair of the Lady's  Lady BETTY  My Lord  WINWORTH  I know your Ladyship can easily prevail upon her to overlook an immaterial punctilio and therefore  Lady BETTY  The Lady my Lord  WINWORTH  Yes Madam Miss Marchmont if she finds my addresses supported by your Ladyship will in all probability be easily induced to receive them and then your Ladyship knows  Lady BETTY  Miss Marchmont my Lord  WINWORTH  Yes Madam Miss Marchmont Since your final disapprobation of those hopes which I was once presumptuous enough to entertain of calling your Ladyship mine the anguish of a rejected passion has render'd me inconceivably wretched and I see no way of mitigating the severity of my situation but in the esteem of this amiable woman who knows how tenderly I have been attached to you and whose goodness will induce her I am well convinced to alleviate as much as possible the greatness of my disappointment  Lady BETTY  Your Lordship is undoubtedly right in your opinion and I am infinitely concern'd to have been the involuntary cause of uneasiness to you but Miss Marchmont my Lord she will merit your utmost  WINWORTH  I know she will Madam and it rejoices me to see you so highly pleas'd with my intention  Lady BETTY  O I am quite delighted with it  WINWORTH  I knew I should please you by it  Lady BETTY  You can't imagine how you have pleas'd me  WINWORTH  How noble is this goodness Then Madam I may expect your Ladyship will be my advocate The injustice which fortune has done Miss Marchmont's merit obliges me to act with a double degree of circumspection for when virtue is unhappily plung'd into difficulties 'tis entitled to an aditional share of veneration  Lady BETTY  aside  How has my folly undone me  WINWORTH  I will not trespass any longer upon your Ladyship's leisure than just to observe that though I have solicited your friendship on this occasion I must nevertheless beg you will not be too much my friend I know Miss Marchmont would make any sacrifice to oblige you and if her gratitude should appear in the least concerned This is a nice point my dear Lady Betty and I must not wound the peace of any person's bosom to recover the tranquility of my own  Exit  Enter  Mrs HARLEY  who speaks  Well my dear is it all over  Lady BETTY  It is all over indeed Emmy  Mrs HARLEY  But why that sorrowful tone and melancholly countenance Must'nt I wish you joy  Lady BETTY  O I am the most miserable woman in the world Would you believe it The business of this interview was to request my interest in his favour with Miss Marchmont  Mrs HARLEY  With Miss Marchmont Then there is not one atom of sincere affection in the universe  Lady BETTY  As to that I have reason to think his sentiments for me are as tender as ever  Mrs HARLEY  He gives you a pretty proof of his tenderness truly when he asks your assistance to marry another woman  Lady BETTY  Had you but seen his confusion  Mrs HARLEY  He might well be confused when after courting you these three years he cou'd think of another and that too at the very moment in which you were ready to oblige him  Lady BETTY  There has been a sort of fatality in the affair and I am punish'd but too justly The woman that wants candour where she is address'd by a man of merit wants a very essential virtue and she who can delight in the anxiety of a worthy mind is little to be pitied when she feels the sharpest stings of anxiety in her own  Mrs HARLEY  But what do you intend to do with regard to this extraordinary request of Lord Winworth will you really suffer him to marry Miss March mont  Lady BETTY  Why what can I do If it was improper for me before I knew any thing of his design in regard to Miss Marchmont to insinuate the least desire of hearing him again on the subject of his heart 'tis doubly improper now when I see he has turn'd his thoughts on another woman and when this woman besides is one of my most valuable friends  Mrs HARLEY  Well courage Lady Betty we are'nt yet in a desperate situation Miss Marchmont loves you as herself and woud'nt I dare say accept the first man in the world if it gave you the least uneasiness I'll go to her therefore this very moment tell her at once how the case is and my life for it her obligations to you  Lady BETTY  Stay Emmy I conjure you stay and as you value my peace of mind be for ever silent on this subject Miss Marchmont has no obligations to me since our acquaintance I have been the only person obliged she has given me a power of serving the worthiest young creature in the world and so far has laid me under the greatest obligation  Mrs HARLEY  Why my dear  Lady BETTY  But suppose I could be mean enough to think an apartment in my house a place in my chariot a seat at my table and a little annuity in case of my decease were obligations when I continually enjoy such a happiness as her friendship and her company Do you think they are obligations which should make a woman of her fine  sense reject the most amiable man existing especially in her circumstances where he has the additional recommendation of an elevated rank and an affluent fortune This wou'd be exacting interest with a witness for trifles and instead of having any little merit to claim from my behaviour to her I shou'd be the most inexorable of all usurers  Mrs HARLEY  Well but suppose Miss Marchmont shou'd not like my Lord  Lady BETTY  Not like him why will you suppose an impossibility  Mrs HARLEY  But let us suppose it for argument sake  Lady BETTY  Why I cannot say but it would please me above all things For still Emmy I am a woman and feel this unexpected misfortune with the keenest sensibility It kills me to think of his being another's but if he must I wou'd rather see him her's than any woman's in the universe But I'll talk no more upon this subject 'till I acquaint her with his proposal and yet Emmy how severe a trial must I go through  Mrs HARLEY  Ay and you most richly deserve it  Exeunt  End of the second  ACT  ACT III  SCENE Lady BETTY's  Garden  Sir HARRY Miss RIVERS  and  SALLY  cross at the head of the stage  Colonel RIVERS  observing them  RIVERS  IN close conversation with Sir Harry this half hour at the remotest part of the garden Why what am I to think of all this Does'nt she know I have refused him Does'nt she know herself engaged to Sidney There's something mean and pitiful in suspicion But still there is something that alarms me in this affair and who knows how far the happiness of my child may be at stake Women after all are strange things they have more sense than we generally allow them but they have also more vanity 'Tis'nt for want of understanding they err but through an insatiable love of slattery They know very well when they are committing a fault but destruction wears so bewitching a form that they rebel against the sense of their own conviction and never trouble themselves about consequences till they are actully undone But here they come I don't like this listening Yet the meanness of the action must for once be justified by the necessity  Retires behind a clump of trees  Enter  Miss RIVERS Sir HARRY  and  SALLY  Miss RIVERS  Indeed Sir Harry you upbraid me very unjustly I feel the refusal which my father has given you severely Nevertheless I must not consent to you proposal An elopement wou'd I am sure  break his heart and as he is wholly ignorant of my partiality for you I cannot accuse him of unkindness  RIVERS  behind  So so so so  Sir HARRY  Why then my dear Miss Rivers woud'nt you give me leave to mention the prepossession with which you honour me to the old Gentleman  RIVERS  The old gentleman  Miss RIVERS  Because I was in hopes my father would have listen'd to your application without putting me to the painful necessity of acknowledging my sentiments in your favour and because I fear'd that unless the application was approved on account of it's intrinsic generosity there was nothing which cou'd possibly work upon the firmness of his temper  RIVERS  Well said daughter  SALLY  The firmness of your father's temper madam The obstinacy you shou'd say Sir Harry as I live and breathe there is'nt so obstinate so perverse and so peevish an old devil in all England  RIVERS  Thank you Mrs Sally  Miss RIVERS  Sally I insist that when you speak of my father you always speak of him with respect 'Tis'nt your knowledge of secrets which shall justify these freedoms for I wou'd rather every  thing was discovered this minute than hear him mention'd with so impudent a similiarity by his servants  SALLY  Well Madam I beg pardon but you know the Colonel where he once determines is never to be alter'd so that call this steadiness of temper by what name you please 'tis likely to make you miserable unless you embrace the present opportunity and go off like a woman of spirit with the object of your affections  RIVERS  What a damn'd jade it is  Sir HARRY  Indeed my dear Miss Rivers Sally advises you like a true friend and I am satisfied your own good sense must secretly argue on her side the question The only alternative you have is to fly and be happy or stay and be miserable You have yourself acknowledg'd my ever adorable  RIVERS  O damn your adorables  Sir HARRY  I say Madam you have yourself acknowledg'd that there is no hope whatsoever of working upon the Colonel's tenderness by acquainting him with our mutual affection On the contrary 'tis likely that had he the least suspicion of my being honour'd with your regard he wou'd drag you instantly to his favourite Sidney who is so utterly insensible of your merit and who if he has a passion for any body is I am confident devoted to Miss Marchmont  RIVERS  Why what a lye has the rascal trump'd up here against poor Sidney  Miss RIVERS  Dear Sir Harry what wou'd you have me do  RIVERS  There Her dear Sir Harry  Sir HARRY  My ever adorable Miss Rivers  RIVERS  No she can't stand these ever adorables  Sir HARRY  This excess of filial affection is extremely amiable but it ought by no means to render you forgetful of what is due to yourself Consider Madam if you have been treated with tenderness you have repaid that tenderness with duty and have so far discharged this mighty obligation  RIVERS  A pretty method of settling accounts truly  Miss RIVERS  Don't my dear Sir Harry speak in this negligent manner of my father  RIVERS  Kind creature  Sir HARRY  From what I have urg'd you must see Madam that though you are so ready to sacrifice your peace for your father he sets a greater value upon a trifing promise than upon your happiness  Judge therefore whether his repose should be dearer to you than your own and judge too whether to prevent the breach of his word you shou'd vow eternal tenderness to a man you must eternally detest and violate even your veracity to kill the object of your love  Miss RIVERS  Good heav'n what shall I do  SALLY  Do Madam go off to be sure  RIVERS  I'll wring that hussey's head off  Sir HARRY  On my knees Madam let me beg you will consult your own happiness and in your own the happiness of your father  RIVERS  Ay now he kneels 'tis all over  Sir HARRY  The Colonel Madam has great sensibility and the consciousness that he himself has been the cause of your unhappiness will sill him with endless regret Whereas by escaping with me the case will be utterly otherwise When he sees we are inseparably united and hears with how unabating an assiduity I labour to merit the blessing of your hand a little time will necessarily make us friends and I have great hopes that before the end of three months we shall be the favourites of the whole family  RIVERS  You'll be cursedly mistaken though  Sir HARRY  But speak my dear Miss Rivers speak and pronounce my fate  Miss RIVERS  Sir Harry you have convinced me  RIVERS  Ay I knew he wou'd  Miss RIVERS  And provided you here give me a solemn assurance that the moment we are married you will employ every possible method of effecting a reconciliation  Sir HARRY  You consent to go off with me the first opportunity a thousand thanks my Angel for this generous condescension and when  Miss RIVERS  There is no occasion for professions Sir Harry I rely implicitly on your tenderness and your honour  SALLY  Dear Madam you have transported your poor Sally by this noble resolution  RIVERS  I dare say she has but I may chance to cool your transport in a horsepond  Miss RIVERS  I am obliged to you Sally for the part you take in my affairs and I purpose that you shall be the companion of my flight  SALLY  Shall I Madam you are too good and I am sure I shoud'nt like to live in my old master's house when you are out of the family  RIVERS  Don't be uneasy on that account  Sir HARRY  Suffer me now my dear Miss Rivers since you have been thus generously kind to inform you that a coach and six will be ready punctually at twelve at the side of the little paddock at the back of Lady Betty's garden There's a close walk you know from the garden to the place and I'll meet you at the spot to conduct you to the coach  Miss RIVERS  Well I am strangely apprehensive but I'll be there However 'tis now high time for us to separate my father's eyes are generally every where and I am impatient since it is determined till our design is executed  RIVERS  O I don't in the least doubt it  Sir HARRY  'Till twelve then farewell my charmer  Miss RIVERs  You do what you will with me  Exeunt separately  RIVERS  comes forward  You do what you will with me Why what a fool what an idiot was I ever to suppose I had a daughter From the moment of her birth to this cursed hour I have labour'd I have toil'd for happiness and now when I fancy'd myself sure of her tend'rest affection she casts me off for ever By and by I shall have this fellow at my feet entreating my forgiveness and the world will think me an unfeeling monster if I don't give him my estate as a reward for having blasted my dearest expectations The world  will think it strange that I shou'd not promote his felicity because he has utterly destroyed mine and my dutiful daughter will be surprized if the tender ties of nature are not strictly regarded in my conduct though she has violated the most sacred of them all in her own Death and hell who wou'd be a father There is yet one way left and if that fails why I never had a daughter  Exit  The  SCENE  changes to an Apartment Enter  Miss MARCHMONT  and  CECIL  Miss MARCHMONT  Nay now Sir I must tax you with unkindness know something that may possibly be of consequence to my welfare and yet decline to tell me Is this consistent with the usual friendship which I have met with from Mr Cecil  CECIL  Look'ye Hortensia 'tis because I set a very great value on your esteem that I find this unwillingness to explain myself  Miss MARCHMONT  Indeed Sir you grow every moment more and more mysterious  CECIL  Well then Hortensia if I thought you woud'nt be offended I  Miss MARCHMONT  I am sure Sir you will never say any thing to give me a reasonable cause of offence I know your kindness for me too well Sir  CECIL  Where is the need of Sirring me at every word I desire you will lay aside this ceremony and  treat me with the same freedom you do every body else these Sirs are so cold and so distant  Miss MARCHMONT  Indeed Sir I can't so easily lay aside my respect as you imagine for I have long considered you as a father  CECIL  As a father but that's a light in which I don't want to be consider'd As a father indeed O she's likely to think me a proper husband for her I can see that already  aside  Miss MARCHMONT  Why not Sir your years your friendship for my father and your partiality for me sufficiently justify the propriety of my epithet  CECIL  aside  My years Yes I thought my years would be an invincible obstacle  Miss MARCHMONT  But pray Sir to the business upon which you wanted to speak with me You don't consider I am all this time upon the rack of my sex's curiosity  CECIL  Why then Hortensia I will proceed to the business and ask you in one word if you have any disinclination to be married  Miss MARCHMONT  This is proceeding to business indeed Sir but ha ha ha pray who have you designed me as a husband  CECIL  Why what do you think of a man about my age  Miss MARCHMONT  Of your age Sir  CECIL  Yes of my age  Miss MARCHMONT  Why Sir what wou'd you advise me to think of him  CECIL  That is'nt the question for all your arch significance of manner Madam  Miss MARHMONT  O I am sure you wou'd never recommend him to me as a husband Sir  CECIL  So and why not pray  Miss MARCHMONT  Because I am sure you have too great a regard for me  CECIL  She gives me rare encouragement  aside  But do you imagine it impossible for such a husband to love you very tenderly  Miss MARCHMONT  No Sir But do you imagine it possible for me to love him very tenderly You see I have caught your own frankness Sir and answer with as much ease as you question me  CECIL  aside  How lucky it was that I did not open myself directly to her O I should have been most purely contemptible  Miss MARCHMONT  But pray Sir have you in reality any meaning by these questions Is there actually any body who has spoken to you on my account  CECIL  Hortensia there is a fellow a very foolish fellow for whom I have some value that entertains the sincerest affection for you  Miss MARCHMONT  Then indeed Sir I am very unhappy for I cannot encourage the addresses of any body  CECIL  No  Miss MARCHMONT  O Sir I had but two friends in the world yourself and Lady Betty and I am with justice apprehensive that neither will consider me long with any degree of regard Lady Betty has a proposal from Lord Winworth of the same nature with yours in which I fear she will strongly interest herself and I must be under the painful necessity of disobliging you both from an utter impossibility of listening to either of your recommendations  CECIL  I tell you Hortensia not to alarm yourself  Miss MARCHMONT  Dear Sir I have always considered you with reverence and it would make me inconceivably wretched if you imagin'd I was actuated upon this occasion by any ridiculous singularity of sentiment I wou'd do much to please you and I scarcely know what I should refuse to Lady Betty's  request but Sir though it distresses me exceedingly to discover it I must tell you I have not a heart to dispose of  CECIL  How's this  Miss MARCHMONT  At the same time I must however tell you that my affections are so plac'd as to make it wholly impossible for me ever to change my situation This acknowledgment of a prepossession Sir may be inconsistent with the nice reserve which is proper for my sex but it is necessary to justify me in a case where my gratitude might be reasonably suspected and when I recollect to whom it is made I hope it will be doubly entitled to an excuse  CECIL  Your candour Hortensia needs no apology but as you have trusted me thus far with your secret may'nt I know why you can have no prospect of being united to the object of your affections  Miss MARCHMONT  Because Sir he is engaged to a most deserving young lady and will be married to her in a few days In short Mr Sidney is the Man for whom I entertain this secret partiality You see therefore that my partiality is hopeless but you see at the same time how utterly improper it would be for me to give a lifeless hand to another while he is entirely master of my affections It would be a meanness of which I think myself incapable and I should be quite unworthy the honour of any deserving hand if circumstanc'd in this manner I could basely stoop to accept it  CECIL  You interest me strangely in your story Hortensia But has Sidney any idea  Miss MARCHMONT  None in the least Before the match with Miss Rivers was in agitation he made addresses to me though privately and I must own his tenderness join'd to his good qualities soon gave me impressions in his favour But Sir I was a poor orphan wholly dependant upon the generosity of others and he was a younger brother of a family great in his birth but contracted in his circumstances What cou'd I do It was not in my power to make his fortune and I had too much pride or too much affection to think of destroying it  CECIL  You are a good girl a very good girl but surely if Lady Betty knows any thing of this matter there can be no danger of her recommending Lord Winworth so earnestly to your attention  Miss MARCHMONT  There Sir is my principle misfortune Lady Betty is of all persons the least proper to be made acquainted with it Her heart is in the marriage between Miss Rivers and Mr Sidney and had she the least idea of my sentitiments for him or of his inclination for me I am positive it would immediately frustrate the match On this account Sir I have carefully concealed the secret of my wishes and on this account I must still continue to conceal it My heart shall break before it shall be worthless  and I should detest myself for ever if I was capable of establishing my own peace at the expence of my benefactress's first wish and the desire of her whole family  CECIL  Zounds what can be the matter with my eyes  Miss MARCHMONT  My life was mark'd out early by calamity and the first light I beheld was purchas'd with the loss of a mother The grave snatched away the best of fathers just as I came to know the value of such a blessing and had'nt it been for the exalted goodness of others I who once experienc'd the unspeakable pleasure of relieving the necessitous had myself perhaps felt the immediate want of bread and shall I ungratefully sting the bosom which has thus benevolently cherished me Shall I basely wound the peace of those who have rescu'd me from despair and stab at their tranquility in the very moment they honour me with protection O Mr Cecil they deserve every sacrifice which I can make May the benignant hand of Providence shower endless happiness upon their heads and may the sweets of a stillencreasing felicity be their portion whatever becomes of me  CECIL  Hortensia I can't stay with you My eyes are exceedingly painful of late what the devil can be the matter with them But let me tell you before I go that you shall be happy after all that you shall I promise you but I see Lady Betty coming this way and I cannot enter into explanations yet do you hear  don't suppose I am angry with you for refusing my friend don't suppose such a thing I charge you for he has too much pride to force himself upon any woman and too much humanity to make any woman miserable He is besides a very foolish fellow and it does'nt signify  Exit  Enter  LADY BETTY  Lady BETTY  Well my dear Hortensia I am come again to ask you what you think of Lord Winworth We were interrupted before and I want as soon as possible for the reason I hinted to know your real opinion of him  Miss MARCHMONT  You have long known my real opinion of him Lady Betty You know I always thought him a very amiable man  Lady BETTY  with impatience  Do you think him an amiable man  Miss MARCHMONT  The whole world thinks as I do in this respect yet  Lady BETTY  Ay she loves him 'tis plain and there is no hope after this declaration  aside  His Lordship merits your good opinion I assure you Miss Marchmont  Miss MARCHMONT  aside  Yes I see by this ceremony that she is offended at my coolness to the proposal  Lady BETTY  I have hinted to you Miss Marchmont that my Lord requested I would exert my little interest with you in his favour  Miss MARCHMONT  The little interest your Ladyship has with me the little interest  Lady BETTY  Don't be displeased with me my dear Hortensia I know my interest with you is considerable I know you love me  Miss MARCHMONT  I would sacrifice my life for you Lady Betty For what had that life been without your generosity  Lady BETTY  If you love me Hortensia never mention any thing of this nature  Miss MARCHMONT  You are too good  Lady BETTY  But to my Lord Winworth He has earnestly requested I would become his advocate with you He has entirely got the better of his former attachments and there can be no doubt of his making you an excellent husband  Miss MARCHMONT  His Lordship does me infinite honour nevertheless  Lady BETTY  eagerly  Nevertheless what my dear  Miss MARCHMONT  I say notwithstanding I think myself highly honour'd by his sentiments in my favour 'tis utterly impossible for me to return his affection  Lady BETTY  surprized  Impossible for you to return his affection  Miss MARCHMONT  aside  I knew what an interest she wou'd take in this affair  Lady BETTY  And do you really say you can't give him a favourable answer How fortunate  aside  Miss MARCHMONT  I do my dear Lady BettyI can honour I can reverence him but I cannot feel that tenderness for his person which I imagine to be necessary both for his happiness and my own  Lady BETTY  Upon my word my dear you are extremely difficult in your choice and if Lord Winworth is not capable of inspiring you with tenderness I don't know who is likely to succeed for in my opinion there is not a man in England possessed of more personal accomplishments  Miss MARCHMONT  And yet great as these accomplishments are my dear Lady Betty they never excited your tenness  Lady BETTY  Why all this is very true my dear but though I felt no tenderness yet I to be sure I that is I say nevertheless This is beyond my hopes  aside  Miss MARCHMONT  aside  She's distress'd that I decline the proposal Her friendship for us both is generously warm and she imagines I am equally insensible to his merit and my own interest  Lady BETTY  Well my dear I see your emotion and I heartily beg your pardon for saying so much I should be inexpressibly concern'd if I thought you made any sacrifice on this occasion to me My Lord to be sure possesses a very high place in my esteem but  Miss MARCHMONT  Dear Lady Betty what can I do I see you are offended with me and yet  Lady BETTY  I offended with you my dear far from it I commend your resolution extremely since my Lord is not a man to your taste Offended with you why should I take the liberty to be offended with you A presumption of that nature  Miss MARCHMONT  Indeed Lady Betty this affair makes me very unhappy  Lady BETTY  Indeed my dear you talk very strangely so far from being sorry that you have refus'd my Lord I am pleas'd infinitely pleas'd that is since he was not agreeable to you Be satisfied your acceptance of him would have given me no pleasure in the world I assure you it wou'd'nt on the contrary as matters are situated I wou'd'nt for the world have you give him the smallest encouragement  Exit  Miss MARCHMONT  alone  I see she's greatly disappointed at my refusal of an offer so highly to my advantage I see moreover she's griev'd that his Lordship should  meet with a second repulse and from a quarter too where the generosity of his proposal might be reasonably expected to promise it success How surpriz'd she seem'd when I told her he cou'd'nt make an impression on my heart and how eagerly she endeavour'd to convince me that she was pleas'd with my conduct not considering that this very eagerness was a manifest proof of her dissatisfaction She is more interested in this affair than I even thought she would be and I should be completely miserable if she cou'd suspect me of ingratitude As she was so zealous for the match I was certainly to blame in declining it 'Tis not yet however too late She has been a thousand parents to me and I will not regard my own wishes when they are any way opposite to her inclinations Poor Mr Cecil Make me happy after all How Impossible for I was born to nothing but misfortune  Exit  End of the third  ACT  ACT IV  SCENE  an Apartment at  Lady BETTY's  House  Enter  Lady BETTY  and  Mrs HARLEY  Lady BETTY  THUS far my dear Emmy there is a gleam of hope She determined positively determined against my Lord And even suspected so little of my partiality for him that she appeared under the greatest anxiety lest I should be offended with her refusing him And yet shall I own my folly to you  Mrs HARLEY  Pray do my dear you'll scarcely believe it but I have follies of my own sometimes  Lady BETTY  Why you quite surprize me  Mrs HARLEY  'Tis very true for all that But to your business  Lady BETTY  Why then greatly as I dreaded her approbation of the proposal I was secretly hurt at her insensibility to the personal attractions of his Lordship  Mrs HARLEY  I don't doubt it my dear We think all the world should love what we are in love with ourselves  Lady BETTY  Your are right And though I was happy to find her resolution so agreeable to my wishes my pride was not a little piqu'd to find it possible for her to refuse a man upon whom I had so ardently plac'd my own affection The surprize which I felt on this account threw a warmth into my expressions and made the generous girl apprehensive that I was offended with her  Mrs HARLEY  Well this is a strange world we live in That a woman without a shilling shou'd refuse an Earl with a fine person and a great estate is the most surprizing affair I ever heard of Perhaps Lady Betty my Lord may take it in his head to go round the family If he should my turn is next and I assure you he shall meet with a very different reception  Lady BETTY  Then you wou'd'nt be cruel Emmy  Mrs HARLEY  Why no Not very cruel I might give myself a few airs at first I might blush a little and look down Wonder what he cou'd find in me to attract his attention Then pulling up my head with a toss of disdain desire him if ever he spoke to me on that subject again  Lady BETTY  Well  Mrs HARLEY  To have a licence in his pocket that's all I would make sure work of it at once and leave it to your elevated minds to deal in delicate absurdities But I have a little anecdote for you  which proves beyond a doubt that you are as much as ever in possession of Lord Winworth's affection  Lady BETTY  What is it my dear Emmy  Mrs HARLEY  Why about an hour ago my woman it seems and Arnold my Lord's man had a little conversation on this unexpected proposal to Miss Marchmont in which Arnold said  Never tell me of your Miss Marchmonts Mrs Nelson between ourselves but let it go no farther Lady Betty is still the woman and a sweet creature she is that's the truth on't but a little fantastical and doesn't know her own mind  Lady BETTY  I'll assure you Why Mr Arnold is a wit  Mrs HARLEY  Well but hear him out  Mrs Nelson I know as much of my Lord's mind as any body let him mary whom he pleases he'll never be rightly happy but with her Ladyship and I'd give a hundred guineas with all my soul that it cou'd be a match  These Nelson tells me were his very words Arnold is an intelligent fellow and much in the confidence of his master  Lady BETTY  Indeed I always thought my Lord happy in so excellent a servant This intelligence is worth a world my dear Emmy  Enter Miss MARCHMONT  Miss MARCHMONT  I have been looking for your Ladyship  Lady BETTY  Have you any thing particular my dear Hortensia But why that gloom upon your features What gives you uneasiness my sweet girl Speak and make me happy by saying it is in my power to oblige you  Miss MARCHMONT  'Tis in your power my dear Lady Betty to oblige me highly by forgiving the ungrateful disregard which I just now shew'd to your recommendation of Lord Winworth  Mrs HARLEY  aside  Now will I be hang'd if she does not undo every thing by a fresh stroke of delicacy  Lady BETTY  My dear  Miss MARCHMONT  And by informing his Lordship that I am ready to pay a proper obedience to your commands  Mrs HARLEY  aside  O the devil take this elevation of sentiment  Lady BETTY  A proper obedience to my commands my dear I really don't understand you  Miss MARCHMONT  I see how generously you are concerned for fear I shou'd upon this occasion offer violence to my inclination But Lady Betty I shou'd be infinitely more distress'd by the smallest act of ingratitude to you than by any other misfortune I am therefore ready in obedience to your wishes to accept of his Lordship and if I can't make him a fond wife I will at least make him a dutiful one  Mrs HARLEY  aside  Now her delicacy is willing to be miserable  Lady BETTY  How cou'd you ever imagine my dear Hortensia that your rejection of Lord Winworth cou'd possibly give me the smallest offence I have a great regard for his Lordship 'tis true but I have a great regard for you also and wou'd by no means wish to see his happiness promoted at your expence think of him therefore no more and be assur'd you oblige me in an infinitely higher degree by refusing than accepting him  Miss MARCHMONT  The more I see your Ladyship's tenderness and delicacy the more I see it necessary to give an affirmative to Lord Winworth's proposal Your generosity must not get the better of my gratitude  Mrs HARLEY  Did ever two fools plague one another so heartily with their delicacy and sentiment  aside  Dear Lady Betty why don't you deal candidly with her  Lady BETTY  Her happiness makes it necessary now and I will  Mrs HARLEY  Ay there's some sense in this  Lady BETTY  Your uncommon generosity my dear Hortensia has led you into an error  Miss MARCHMONT  Not in the least Lady Betty  Lady BETTY  Still Hortensia you are running into very great mistakes My esteem for Lord Winworth let me now tell you  Enter  WINWORTH  WINWORTH  Ladies your most obedient As I enter'd Lady Betty I heard you pronounce my name May I presume to ask if you were talking to Miss Marchmont on the business I took the liberty of communicating to you this morning  Mrs HARLEY  aside  Ay now it's all over I see  Lady BETTY  Why to be candid my Lord I have mentioned your proposal  WINWORTH  Well my dear Miss Marchmont and may I flatter myself that Lady Betty's interposition will induce you to be propitious to my hopes The heart now offer'd to you Madam is a grateful one and will retain an eternal sense of your goodness Speak therefore my dear Miss Marchmont and kindly say you condescend to accept it  Mrs HARLEY  aside  Sohere will be a comfortable piece of work I'll e'en retire and leave them to the consequences of their ridiculous delicacy  Exit  Miss MARCHMONT  I know not what to say my Lord you have honoured me greatly honoured me but Lady Betty will acquaint you with my determination  Lady BETTY  I acquaint him my dearsurely you are yourself the most proper toI shall run distracted  aside  Miss MARCHMONT  Indeed madam I can't speak to his lordship on this subject  Lady BETTY  And I assure you Hortensia 'tis a subject upon which I do not chuse to enter  Lord WINWORTH  If you had a kind answer from Miss Marchmont Lady Betty I am sure you would enter upon it readily But I see her reply very clearly in your reluctance to acquaint me with it  Miss MARCHMONT  Why Madam will you force me to  Lady BETTY  And why Hortensia What am I going to say  aside  Lord WINWORTH  Don't my dear Ladies suffer me to distress you any longer to your friendship Madam I am as much indebted  addressing himself to Lady Betty  as if I had been successful and I sincerely wish Miss Marchmont that happiness with a more deserving man which I find it impossible for her to confer on me  going  Lady BETTY  aside  Now I have some hope  Miss MARCHMONT  My Lord I entreat your stay  Lady BETTY  Don't call his Lordship back my dear it will have an odd appearance  Enter  Lord WINWORTH  Miss MARCHMONT  He is come back And I must tell him what your unwillingness to influence my inclinations makes you decline  Lord WINWORTH  Your commands Madam  Lady BETTY  aside  Now I am undone again  Miss MARCHMONT  I am in such a situation my Lord that I can scarcely proceed Lady Betty is cruelly kind to me but as I know her wishes  Lady BETTY  My wishes Miss Marchmont indeed my dear there is such a mistake  Miss MARCHMONT  There is no mistaking your Ladyship's goodness you are fearful to direct my resolution and I should be unkind to distress your friendship any longer  Lady BETTY  You do distress me indeed Miss Marchmont  half aside and sighing  Lord WINWORTH  I am all expectation Madam  Miss MARCHMONT  I am compell'd by gratitude to both and from affection to my dear Lady Betty to break through the common forms impos'd on our sex and to declare that I have no will but her Ladyship's  Lady BETTY  This is so provoking  aside  Lord WINWORTH  Ten thousand thanks for this condescending goodness Madam a goodness which is additionally dear to me as the result of your determination is pronounc'd by your own lips  Miss MARCHMONT  Well Lady Betty I hope I have answer'd your wishes now  Lady BETTY  You cannot conceive how sensibly I am touch'd with your behaviour my dear  sighs  Miss MARCHMONT  You feel too much for me Lady Betty  Lady BETTY  Why I do feel something my dear this unexpected event has fill'd my heart and I am a little agitated But come my dear let us now go to the company  Miss MARCHMONT  How generously Madam do you interest yourself for my welfare  Lord WINWORTH  And for the welfare of all her friends  Lady BETTY  Your Lordship is too good  Lord WINWORTH  But the business of her life is to promote the happiness of others and she is constantly rewarded in the exercise of her own benignity  Lady BETTY  You can't imagine how I am rewarded upon the present occasion I assure your Lordship  Exeunt  SCENE  the Paddock behind  Lady BETTY's  Garden  Enter  Miss RIVERS  and  SALLY  SALLY  Dear Madam don't terrify yourself with such gloomy reflections  Miss RIVERS  O Sally you can't conceive my distress in this critical situation An elopement even from a tyrannical father has something in it which must shock a delicate mind But when a woman flies from the protection of a parent who merits the utmost return of her affection she must be insensible indeed if she does not feel the sincerest regret If he shoud'nt forgive me  SALLY  Dear Madam he must forgive you are'nt you his child  Miss RIVERS  And therefore I shoud'nt disoblige him I am half distracted and I almost repent the promise I gave Sir Harry when I consider how much my character may be lessened by this step and recollect how it is likely to affect my unfortunate father  SALLY  But I wonder where Sir Harry can be all this time  Miss RIVERS  I wish he was come  SALLY  Courage Madam I hear him coming  Miss RIVERS  It must be he let's run and meet him  Enter  RIVERS  Sally shrieks and runs off  Miss RIVERS  My father  RIVERS  Yes Theodora your poor abandoned miserable father  Miss RIVERS  Oh Sir  RIVERS  Little Theodora did I imagine I shou'd ever have cause to lament the hour of your birth and less did I imagine when you arrived at an age to be perfectly acquainted with your duty you wou'd throwevery sentiment of duty off In what my dear has your unhappy father been culpable that you cannot bear his society any longer What has he done to forfeit either your esteem or your affection From the moment of your birth to this unfortunate hour he has laboured to promote your happiness But how has his solicitude on that account been rewarded You now fly from these arms which have cherished you with so much tenderness when gratitude generosity and nature should have twin'd me round your heart  Miss RIVERS  Dear Sir  RIVERS  Look back infatuated child upon my whole conduct since your approach to maturity Hav'n't I contracted my own enjoyments on purpose to enlarge yours and watched your very looks to anticipate your inclinations Have I ever with the obstinacy of other fathers been partial in favour of any man to whom you made the slightest objection Or have I ever shewn  the least design of forcing your wishes to my own humour or caprice On the contrary has'nt the engagement I have enter'd into been carried on  seemingly with your own approbation And hav'n't you always appeared reconciled at least to a marriage with Mr Sidney  Miss RIVERS  I am so asham'd of myself  RIVERS  How then Theodora have I merited a treatment of this nature You have understanding my dear though you want filial affection and my arguments must have weight with your reason however my tranquility may be the object of your contemptI lov'd you Theodora with the warmest degree of paternal tenderness and flatter'd myself the proofs I every day gave of that tenderness had made my peace of mind a matter of some importance to my child But alas a paltry compliment from a coxcomb undoes the whole labour of my life and the daughter whom I looked upon as the support of my declining years betrays me in the unsuspecting hour of security and rewards with her person the assassin who stabs me to the heart  Miss RIVERS  Hear me dear Sir hear me  RIVERS  I do not come here Theodora to stop your flight or put the smallest impediment in the way of your wishes Your person is your own and I scorn to detain even my daughter by force where she is not bound to me by inclination Since therefore neither duty nor discretion a regard for my peace nor a solicitude for your own welfare  are able to detain you go to this man who has taught you to obliterate the sentiments of nature and gain'd a ready way to your heart by expressing a contempt for your father Go to him boldly my child and laugh at the pangs which tear this unhappy bosom Be uniformly culpable nor add the baseness of a despicable slight to the unpardonable want of a filial affection  Going  Miss RIVERS  I am the most miserable creature in the world  RIVERS  Returns  One thing more Theodora and then farewell for ever Though you come here to throw off the affection of a child I will not quit this place before I discharge the duty of a parent even to a romantic extravagance and provide for your welfare while you plunge me into the most poignant of all distress In the doating hours of paternal blandishment I have often promised you a fortune of twenty thousand pounds whenever you chang'd your situation This promise was indeed made when I thought you incapable either of ingratitude or dissimulation and when I fancied your person wou'd be given where there was some reasonable prospect of your happiness But still it was a promise and shall be faithfully discharged Here then in this pocketbook are notes for that sum  Miss RIVERS  shews an unwillingness to receive the pocketbook    Take it but never see me more Banish my name eternally from your remembranceand when a little time shall remove me from a world which your conduct has rendered insupportable boast an additional title my dear to your husband's regard by having shorten'd the life of your miserable father  Exit  Enter  SALLY  SALLY  What Madam is he gone  Miss RIVERS  How could I be such a monster such an unnatural monster as ever to think of leaving him But come Sally let us go into the house  SALLY  Go into the house Madam Why are'nt we to go off with Sir Harry  Miss RIVERS  This insensible creature has been my confident too O I shall eternally detest myself  Enter  Sir HARRY  and  CECIL  Sir HARRY  I beg a thousand pardons my dear Miss Rivers for detaining you An unforeseen accident prevented me from being punctual but the carriage is now ready and a few hours will whirl us to the summit of felicity My cousin Cecil is kindly here to assist us and  Miss RIVERS  Sir Harry I can never forsake my father  Sir HARRY  Madam  Miss RIVERS  By some accident he discovered our design and came to this spot while I was trembling with expectation of your appearance  Sir HARRY  Well my dear creature  Miss RIVERS  Here in a melancholy but resolute voice he expatiated on the infamy of my intended slight and mentioned my want of affection for him in terms that pierc'd my very soul Having done this he took an abrupt leave and scorning to detain me by force forsook me to the course of my own inclinations  Sir HARRY  Well my angel and since he has left you to follow your own inclinations you will not surely hesitate to  Miss RIVERS  Sir Harry unloose my hand the universe wou'd'nt bribe me now to go off with you O Sir Harry if you regarded your own peace you wou'd cease this importunity for is it possible that a woman can make a valuable wife who has prov'd an unnatural daughter  Sir HARRY  But consider your own happiness my dear Miss Rivers  Miss RIVERS  My own happiness Sir Harry What a wretch must the woman be who can dream of happiness while she wounds the bosom of a father  CECIL  What a noble girl I shall love her myself for her sense and her goodness  SALLY  aside to  Sir HARRY  She won't consent I know Sir Harry so if the coach is at hand it will be the best way to carry her off directly  Sir HARRY  Then my dear Miss Rivers there is no hope  Miss RIVERS  Sir Harry I must not hear you This parting is a kind of death  Sir HARRY  Part Madam by all that's gracious we must not part My whole soul is unalterably fix'd upon you and since neither tenderness for yourself nor affection for me persuade you to the only measure which can promote our mutual felicity you must forgive the despair that forces you from hence and commits a momentary disrespect to avoid a lasting unhappiness  Miss RIVERS  Hear me Sir Harry I conjure you hear me  Sir HARRY  Let me but remove you from this place Madam and I'll hear every thing Cecil assist me  Miss RIVERS  O Mr Cecil I rely upon your honour to save and protect me  CECIL  And it shall Madam For shame kinsman unhand the Lady  Sir HARRY  Unhand her what do you mean Cecil  CECIL  What do I mean I mean to protect the Lady What should a man of honour mean  Miss RIVERS  breaking from  Sir Harry  Dear Mr Cecil don't let him follow me  She runs off  SALLY  following  I'll give her warning this moment that's the short and the long of it  Exit  Sir HARRY  Mr Cecil this is no time for trisling Did'nt you come here to assist me in carrying the Lady off  CECIL  With her own inclinations kinsman but as they are now on the other side of the question so am I too You must not follow her Sir Harry  Sir HARRY  Zounds but I will  CECIL  Zounds but you shan't Look'ye Harry I came here to assist the purposes of a man of honour not to abet the violence of a russian your friends of the world your fashionable friends may if they please support one another's vices but I am a friend only to the virtues of a man and where I sincerely esteem him I always endeavour to make him honest in spite of his teeth  Sir HARRY  An injury like this  CECIL  Harry Harry don't advance I am not to be terrified you know from the support of what is just and though you may think it very brave to sight in the defence of a bad action it will do but little credit either to your understanding or your humanity  Sir HARRY  Dear Cecil there's no answering that Your Justice and your generosity overpower me  You have restored me to myself It was mean it was unmanly it was infamous to think of using force But I was distracted nay I am distracted now and must entirely rely upon your assistance to recover her  CECIL  As far as I can act with honesty Harry you may depend upon me but let me have no more violence I beg of you  Sir HARRY  Don't mention it Cecil I am heartily asham'd  CECIL  And I am heartily glad of it  Sir HARRY  Pray let us go to my house and consult a little What a contemptible figure do I make  CECIL  Why pretty well I think but to be less so put up your sword Harry  Sir HARRY  She never can forgive me  CECIL  If she does she will scarcely deserve to be forgiven herself  Sir HARRY  Don't Cecil 'tis ungenerous to be so hard upon me I own my faults and you should encourage me for every coxcomb has not so much modesty  CECIL  Why so I will Harry for modesty I see as yet sits upon you but very aukwardly  Exeunt  End of the fourth  ACT  ACT V  SCENE  an Apartment at  Lady BETTY's  Enter  RIVERS  and  SIDNEY  SIDNEY  I AM deeply sensible of Miss Rivers's very great merit Sir but  RIVERS  But what Sir  SIDNEY  Hear me with temper I beseech you Colonel  RIVERS  Hear you with temper I don't know whether I shall be able to hear you with temper but go on Sir  SIDNEY  Miss Rivers independent of her very affluent fortune Colonel has beauty and merit which would make her alliance a very great honour to the first family in the kingdom But notwithstanding my admiration of her beauty and my reverence for her merit I find it utterly impossible to prosit either by her goodness or your generosity  RIVERS  How is all this Sir do you decline a marriage with my daughter  SIDNEY  A marriage with Miss Rivers Sir was once the object of my highest ambition and had I been honoured with her hand I should have studied to shew my sensibility of a blessing so invaluble but at that time I did not suppose  my happiness to be incompatible with her's I am now convinced that is so and it becomes me much better to give up my own hopes than to offer the smallest violence to her inclinations  RIVERS  Death and hell Sir what do you mean by this behaviour Shall I prefer your alliance to any man's in England Shall my daughter even express a readiness to marry you and shall you after this insolently tell me you don't choose to accept her  SIDNEY  Dear Colonel you totally misconceive my motive and I am sure upon reflexion you will rather approve than condemn it A man of common humanity Sir in a treaty of marriage should consult the lady's wishes as well as his own and if he can't make her happy he will scorn to make her miserable  RIVERS  Scorn to make her miserable why the fellow's mad I believe Does'nt the girl absolutely consent to have you Would you have her drag you to the altar by force Would you have her fall at your feet and beg of you with tears to pity one of the finest women with one of the best fortunes in England  SIDNEY  Your vehemence Sir prevents you from considering this matter in a proper light Miss Rivers is sufficiently unhappy in losing the man of her heart but her distress must be greatly aggravated if in the moment she is most keenly sensible of this loss she is compelled to marry another Besides Colonel I must have my seelings  too There is something shocking in a union with a woman whose affections we know to be alienated and 'tis difficult to say which is most entitled to contempt he that stoops to accept of a preengaged mind or he that puts up with a prostituted person  RIVERS  Mighty well Sir mighty well but let me tell you Mr Sidney that under this specious appearance of generosity I can easily see your your motive for this refusal of my daughter let me tell you I can easily see your motive Sir and let me tell you that the person who is in possession of your affections shall no longer find an asylum in this house  SIDNEY  Colonel if I had not been always accustomed to respect you and if I did not even consider this insult as a kind of compliment I don't know how I should put up with it as to your insinuation you must be more explicit before I can understand you  RIVERS  Miss Marchmont Sir Do you understand me now Sir If Miss Marchmont had not been in the case my daughter had not received this insult Sir Harry was right and had not I been ridiculously besotted with your hypocritical plausibility I might have seen it sooner but your cousin shall know of your behaviour and then Sir you shall answer me as a man  SIDNEY  Miss Marchmont Colonel is greatly above this illiberal reflexion as for myself I shall be always ready to justify an action which I know to  be right though I should be sorry ever to meet you but in the character of a friend  Exit  RIVERS  alone  Well well well but it doesn't signify it doesn't signify it doesn't signify I won't put myself in a passion about it I won't put myself in a passion about it I'll tear the fellow piecemeal Zounds I don't know what I'll do  Exit  Enter  Mrs HARLEY  and  CECIL  CECIL  Why this is better and better  Mrs HARLEY  What a violent passion he's in  CECIL  This is the very thing I could wish 'twill advance a principal part of our project rarely well is'nt Sidney a noble young fellow and does'nt he richly deserve the regard which my poor little girl entertains for him  Mrs HARLEY  Why really I think he does but how secretly my Lady Sentimental carried matters O I always said that your grave reflecting moralizing damsels were a thousand times more susceptible of tender impressions than those lively open hearted girls who talk away at random and seem ready to run off with every man that happens to fall into their company  CECIL  I don't know widow but there may be some truth in this you see at least I have such a good opinion of a madcap that you are the first person I have made acquainted with the secret  Mrs HARLEY  Well and hav'nt I returned the compliment by letting you into my design about Lady Betty and Lord Winworth  CECIL  What a ridiculous bustle is there here about delicacy and stuffyour people of refin'd sentiments are the most troublesome creatures in the world to deal with and their friends must even commit a violence upon their nicety before they can condescend to study their own happiness But have you done as we concerted  Mrs HARLEY  Yes I have pretended to Lady Betty that my Lord desires to speak with her privately on business of the utmost importance and I have told his Lordship that she wants to see him to disclose a secret that must intirely break off the intended marriage with Miss Marchmont  CECIL  What an aukward figure they must make each imagining that the other has desired the interview and expecting every moment to be told something of consequence but you have not given either the least hint of Hortensia's secret inclination for Sidney  Mrs HARLEY  How could you possibly suppose such a thing  CECIL  Well well to your part of the business then while I find out the Colonel and try what I can do with him for my rattlepated Sir Harry  Mrs HARLEY  O never doubt my assiduity in an affair of this nature  Exeunt  Enter  Lady BETTY  in another Apartment  Lady BETTY  What can he want with me I wonderSpeak with me again in private and upon business of the utmost importance he has spoken sufficiently to me already upon his business of importance to make me miserable for ever But the fault is my own and I have nobody to blame but myself Bless me here he is  Enter  WINWORTH  WINWORTH  Madam your most devoted I come in obedience to your commands to  Lady BETTY  My commands my Lord  WINWORTH  Yes Madam your message has alarm'd me prodigiously and you cannot wonder if I am a little impatient for an explanation  Lady BETTY  Impatient for an explanation my Lord  WINWORTH  Yes Madam the affair is of the nearest concern to my happiness and the sooner you honour me with  Lady BETTY  Honour you with what my Lord  WINWORTH  My dear Lady Betty this reserve is unkind especially as you know how uneasy I must be till I hear from yourself  Lady BETTY  Really my Lord I am quite astonished uneasy till you hear from myself impatient for an explanation I beg your Lordship will tell me what is the meaning of all this  WINWORTH  Surely Madam you cannot so suddenly change your kind intentions  Ledy BETTY  My kind intentions my Lord  WINWORTH  I would not Madam be too presuming but as I know your Ladyship's goodness I flatter myself that  Lady BETTY  Your Lordship is all a mysteryI beg you will speak out for upon my word I don't understand these half sentences  WINWORTH  Why Madam Mrs Harley has told me  Lady BETTY  with eagerness  What has she told you my Lord  WINWORTH  She has told me of the secret Madam which you have to disclose that must entirely break off my marriage with Miss Marchmont  Lady BETTY  Has she then betrayed my weakness  WINWORTH  Madam I hope you won't think your generous intentions in my favour a weakness for be assur'd that the study of my whole life  Lady BETTY  I did not think that Mrs Harley could be capable of such an action but since she has told you of the only circumstance which I ever wish'd to be conceal'd I cannot deny my partiality for your Lordship  WINWORTH  Madam  Lady BETTY  This secret was trusted with her and her alone but though she has ungenerously discover'd it her end will still be disappointed I acknowledge that I prize your Lordship above all the world but even to obtain you I will not be guilty of a baseness nor promote my own happiness by any act of injustice to Miss Marchmont  WINWORTH  I am the most unfortunate man in the world and does your Ladyship really honour me with any degree of a tender partiality  Lady BETTY  This question is needless my Lord after what Mrs Harley has acquainted you with  WINWORTH  Mrs Harley Madam has not acquainted me with particulars of any nature  Lady BETTY  No  WINWORTH  No And happy as this discovery would have made me at any other time it now distresses me beyond expression since the engagements I have just enter'd into with Miss Marchmont put it wholly out of my power to receive any benefit from the knowledge of your sentiments O Lady Betty had you been generously candid when I solicited the blessing of your hand how much had I been indebted to your goodness but now think what my situation is when in the moment I am sensible of your regard I must give you up for ever  Enter  CECIL  and  Mrs HARLEY  from opposite Places  Mrs HARLEY  repeating ludicrously  Who can behold such beauty and be silent  CECIL  in the same accent  Desire first taught us words  Mrs HARLEY  Man when created wander'd up and down  CECIL  Forlorn and silent as his vassal beasts  Mrs HARLEY  But when a heav'nborn maid like you appear'd  CECIL  Strange pleasure fill'd his eyes and seiz'd his heart  Mrs HARLEY  Unloos'd his tongue  CECIL  And his first talk was love    Both  ha ha ha  WINWORTH  Pray Mr Cecil what is the meaning of this whimsical behaviour  Lady BETTY  The nature of this conduct Mrs Harley bears too strong a resemblance to a late disingenuity for me to wonder at  Mrs HARLEY  What disingenuity my dear  Lady BETTY  Why pray Madam what secret had I to disclose to his Lordship  Mrs HARLEY  The secret which you have disclos'd my dear  courtseying  CECIL  I beg my Lord that we may'nt interrupt your heroics  when in the moment you are sensible  of her regard you must give her up for ever  A very moving speech Mrs Harley I am sure it almost makes me cry to repeat it  WINWORTH  Mr Cecil listening is  Mrs HARLEY  What are we going to have a quarrel  CECIL  O yes your lover is a mere nobody without a little bloodshed two or three duels give a wonderful addition to his character  Lady BETTY  Why what is the meaning of all this  CECIL  You shall know in a moment Madam so walk in good people walk in and see the most surprising pair of true lovers who have too much sense to be wise and too much delicacy to be happy  Mrs HARLEY  Walk in walk in  Enter  RIVERS Miss RIVERS Miss MARCHMONT Sir HARRY  and  SIDNEY  Lady BETTY  O Emmy is this behaving like a friend  Mrs HARLEY  Yes and like a true friend as you shall see presently  RIVERS  My Lord I give you joy joy heartily We have been posted for some time under the direction of Marshal Cecil and General Harley in the next room who have acquainted us with every  thing and I feel the sincerest satisfaction to think the perplexities of today have so fortunate a conclusion  WINWORTH  The perplexities of today are not yet concluded Colonel  Miss MARCHMONT  O Lady Betty why wou'dn't you trust me with your secret I have been the innocent cause of great uneasiness to you and yet my conduct entirely proceeded from the greatness of my affection  Lady BETTY  I know it my dear I know it well but were you to give up Lord Winworth this moment be assured that I wou'dn't accept of any sacrifice made at the expence of your happiness  CECIL  At the Expence of her happiness O is that all Come here master Sobersides  to  Sidney and come here Madam Gravity  to  Miss Marchmont come here I say I suppose my Lord I suppose Lady Betty that you already know from what very manly motivesSidney here has declined the marriage with Miss Rivers  WINWORTH  I do and though I lament the impossibility of a relation to the Colonel's family I cannot but admire his behaviour on that occasion  Lady BETTY  And I think it extremely generous  Mrs HARLEY  Come Cecil stand by a little you shan't have the whole management of this discovery  CECIL  Did you ever see such a woman  Mrs HARLEY  Well my Lord and Lady Betty since we have agreed thus far you must know that Mr Sidney's behaviour has produced more good consequences than you can imagine In the first place it has enabled Colonel Rivers without a breach of his word  CECIL  To give his daughter to my foolish kinsman  Mrs HARLEY  You wont hold your tongue  CECIL  And in the next place it has enabled Mr Sidney  Mrs HARLEY  To marry Miss Marchmont  CECIL  Ay she will have the last word For it seems that between these two turtles there has long subsisted  Mrs HARLEY  A very tender affection  CECIL  The devil's in her tongue she has the speed of me  WINWORTH  What an unexpected felicity  Lady BETTY  I am all amazement  RIVERS  Well well my dear sisterno wondering about it at a more convenient time you shall know particulars for the present let me tell you that now I am cool and that matters have been properly  explain'd to me I am not only satisfied but charm'd with Mr Sidney's behaviour though it has prevented the first wish of my heart and I hope that his Lordship and you by consenting to his marriage with Miss Marchmont will immediately remove every impediment in the way of your own happiness  WINWORTH  If my own happiness was not to be promoted by such a step I should instantly give my consent and therefore my dear Miss Marchmont if I have Lady Betty's approbation and your own concurrence I here bestow this hand upon as deserving a young man as any in the universe This is the only attonement I can make for the uneasiness I have given you and if your happiness is any way proportion'd to your merit I need not wish you a greater share of felicity  SIDNEY  What shall I say my Lord  WINWORTH  Say nothing Charles for if you only knew how exquisite a satisfaction I receive on this occasion you would rather envy my feelings than think yourself under an obligation and now my dear Lady Betty if I might presume  Lady BETTY  That I may not be censur'd any longer I here declare my hand your Lordship's whenever you think proper to demand it for I am now convinc'd the greatest proof which a woman can give of her own worth is to entertain an affection for a man of honour and understanding  WINWORTH  This goodness Madam is too great for acknowledgment  Lady BETTY  And now my dear Theodora let me congratulate with you I rejoice that your inclinations are consulted in the most important circumstance of your life and I am sure Sir Harry will not be wanting in gratitude for the partiality which you have shewn in his favour  Miss RIVERS  Dear Madam you oblige me infinitely  Sir HARRY  And as for me Lady Betty it is so much my inclination to deserve the partiality with which Miss Rivers has honour'd me as well as to repay the goodness of her family that I shall have little merit in my gratitude to either I have been wild I have been inconsiderate but I hope I never was despicable and I flatter myself I shan't be wanting in acknowledgment only to those who have laid me under the greatest of all obligations  RIVERS  Sir Harry say no more My girl's repentance has been so noble your Cousin Cecil's behaviour has been so generous and I believe you after all to be a man of such principle that next to Sidney I don't know who I shou'd prefer to you for a soninlaw But you must think a little for the future and remember that it is a poor excuse for playing the fool to be possessed of a good understanding  WINWORTH  Well there seems but one thing remaining undone I just now took the liberty of exercising a father's right over Miss Marchmont by disposing of her hand 'tis now necessary for me  CECIL  Hold my Lord I guess what you are about but you shan't monopolize generosity I assure you I have a right to shew my friendship as well as your Lordship so after your kinsman's marriage whatever you have a mind to do for him shall be equalled on my part for Miss Marchmont guinea for guinea as far as you will and let's see who tires first in going through with it  WINWORTH  A noble challange and I accept it  Lady BETTY  No there's no bearing this  Miss MARCHMONT  Speak to them Mr Sidney for I cannot  SIDNEY  I wish I had words to declare my sense of this goodness  RIVERS  I did'nt look upon myself as a very pitiful fellow but I am strangely sunk in my own opinion since I have been a witness of this transaction  CECIL  Why what the devil is there in all this to wonder at People of fortune often throw away thousands at the hazard table to make themselves miserable and nobody ever accuses them of generosity  WINWORTH  Mr Cecil is perfectly right and he is the best manager of a fortune who is most attentive to the wants of the deserving  Mrs HARLEY  Why now all is as it shou'd be all is as it shou'd be this is the triumph of good sense over delicacy I could cry for downright joy I wonder what ails me this is all my doing  CECIL  No part of it is mine and I think it extremely happy for your people of refin'd sentiments to have friends with a little common understanding  RIVERS  Sister I always thought you a woman of sense  Mrs HARLEY  Yes she has been a long time intimate with me you know  CECIL  Well said saucebox  Sir HARRY  If this story was to be represented on the stage the poet would think it his duty to punish me for life because I was once culpable  WINWORTH  That wou'd be very wrong The stage shou'd be a school of morality and the noblest of all lessons is the forgiveness of injuries  RIVERS  True my Lord But the principal moral to be drawn from the transactions of today is that those who generously labour for the happiness of others will sooner or later arrive at happiness themselves  FINIS  EPILOGUE  Written by DAVID GARRICK Esq  Spoken by Mrs DANCER  WHEN with the comic muse a bard hath dealing  The
