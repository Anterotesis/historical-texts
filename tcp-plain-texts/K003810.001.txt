PARENTS shed their CHILDREN'S blood  SMOLLETT  PRINTED FOR PRATT AND CLINCH BATH▪ AND R BALDWIN LONDON  M DCC LXXX  TO D  R  DELACOUR  SIR  I AM not going to ascribe to you a miracle I renounce enthusiasm and think too highly of your understanding to insult it by flattery But so far as  second  causes may be necessary to fulfil the fiat of the  first  in the government of human affairs I do in the most solemn manner believe you were the means of saving me in the last summer from death  Prior to the event which procured me the benefit of your advice it had been my chief pleasure to compose the volumes which now approach you Struck by an uncommon tenderness in the circumstances whereon the work is founded I wished earnestly for health to finish what might prove a source of virtuous entertainment Not that I laid any stress on my  own  effort towards it but because the facts were preeminently beautiful in  themselves  and courted every addition of fancy with every embellishment of the heart I recovered Emma Corbett was  concluded The incidents without the least literary adornment take a strong hold of the feelings and probably will owe more to their simplicity and native TRUTH than if by a more elaborate effort I had robbed them of this  genuine  advantage  The tear of Sensibility  is at once the softest and best evidence of the praise which it is my ambition to merit on this occasion and if it be my lot to enjoy this honour you cannot be ignorant of the means by which it has been conferred Notwithstanding this  every thing which tends to shew the world how entirely your  generosity  prevailed over your  interest  will I know be interdicted I comply therefore Sir with the proscriptions of delicacy though I am thereby deprived of doing justice and with whatever difficulty I repress the current of my gratitude only reserving to myself the pleasure to declare publicly how much I am Sir  Your most obliged And most obedient servant THE AUTHOR  BATH  April  EMMA CORBETT  LETTER I  TO HENRY HAMMOND ESQ  HAMMOND you have hurt me I can no longer look on you with pleasure Forbear your visits My daughter Emma shall not be yours I have an objection Will you hear it explained Being explained will you  remove  it You can you ought you  must  or this closes our connection To be at a  word will you render it  possible  for me to call you my son I write in confidence Reply without delay I love exactness Farewell  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER II  MR HAMMOND's ANSWER  THERE is then a possibility O my dear Mr Corbett of surmounting this objection Do you ask as a petition what you might claim as a command Generous friend O name the circumstance hint your expectations and give meall that I can desirean opportunity to obey them Have you not been the guardian of my youth Are you not the father of Emma I am all impatience and I am  Ever yours HENRY HAMMOND  LETTER III  TO MR HAMMOND  YOUR promises are fair and the language in which they are expressed is proper to your age and suitable to your character I hasten to give you the opportunity you inviteResign your commission  that  commission which against all dissuasive hints you have solicited and procured Transfer your sword or else draw it in the cause of liberty and heaven Your schoolfellow Edward has as you know fallen a victim to these hostilities My darling son is no more He was plentifully provided for in the colonies The spot which he occupied was disforested  forested by his ancestors who at the cost of infinite toil turned to a smiling domain what they found a wilderness inauspicious to every purpose of society It descended to this unhappy youth just as tyranny began to forge chains for freedom and he traversed the sea to defend his property He would not suffer the legacy of his uncle to be ravished from him by the spoiler while a hand remained to prevent the plunder He took possession of the land which before was under the superintendance of an agent You know how soon he was invaded how soon his little territory was laid waste his house set fire to and how when the enemy advanced to his door he was hurried  into arms He became a soldier on necessity He foughtHe fell  The blow which killed a son had well nigh killed a father alsoYet in presence of Emma and you I exerted my utmost fortitude But the wound is not healed it is still bleeding at my heart To men's eyes it seems well I have tyed about it a political bandage yet I secretly detest every principle which  begun  and every motive which  continues  this  assassination of America  Long I have kept the anguish of these sentiments to myself It makes no part of my conversation but now finding your ardour O my dear Harry likely to take a wrong direction it is time to speakit is  time to tell you what will  lose  and what  gain  me for  ever  Hammond you are about to engage in a cruel causea cause to which I object both as patriot and as parent The vigour with which you have sought to obtain an authority to go forth  amongst  your countrymen  against  your countrymen bears in it something shocking to my nature Whom I thought tender I find bloody Do you desire to be a hero the means are ready Change the position of the attack and  that  will in itself be heroism Or which is still  better  if you could cultivate the embellishing arts of peace and the Muses who love you apologize to your patron the Earl for the trouble you have giventake  the hand of Emma Corbett and with her share the fortunes of her father  These sentiments declare my opinion of your honour and my esteem for your person is expressed in the presents I tender Perceiving how obstinately you were bent to aid this fallacious plot against the rights of nature and mankind I thought to let you go blindly on to blacken yet more the catalogue of British oppressors But I well knew the source and progress of that sentiment which unites you to my only surviving child And I feel myself unwilling that the son of a dear deceased friend should thus prostitute his courage in an action so peculiarly base so peculiarly  barbarous Emma fortune and my favour are before you You know the prizes and you are not now ignorant of the only mode of conduct by which they can be obtained Farewell then Think seriously venerate my trust and do not forfeit my esteem I put you to the test  CHARLES CORBETT  Letter V  TO C CORBETT ESQ  No greater time is necessary to determine than that which will be taken up in penning the determination I  do  venerate your trust My principles make sacred every man's private opinion but the very same principles compel me to forfeit even  your  affection sir if it is to be preserved at the price of my duty We unfortunately happen to see the American dispute in opposite lights it is sufficient to a soldier that he believes his quarrel to be just You arraign my humanity Wherefore I retort not the accusation May we not consider a public contest in different  points of view and yet be friends Both may act from feeling and both on principle You imagine America is aggrieved while I look upon  her  as the aggressor What of that do we interfere with the opinions of each other I was not accessary to the death of your son and had it been my fate to meet him in the field I can conceive the point on which nature would have insisted She would gracefully have led us both a little from the line of duty and spared one in sympathy to the other Nay more Had I seen the sword tremble at his bosom my own should for that moment have been as a shield and you know not  how  far I would have ventured for the brother of Emma But  as to the commission O be assured I did not sollicit till I had well reflected on every consequence probable and possible of obtaining it It  is  obtained and I rejoice nor could it be resigned to purchase a diadem with Emma on a throne to wear it Change sides No sir if these are to be the terms take back the hand you  permitted  me to win and possess undivided her fortune and your own You have not looked accurately at my soul As I am not on the one hand so  sensual  to gratify my passion at the expence of the holy faith and the solemn services which I have sworn to my country so neither am I so  sordid  on the other as to court her inheritance without many endeavours consistent  with the powers of my youth to add something to her fortune Patrimony hath dropt from my hope but nature may perhaps have bestowed the equivalent The arts of war rather than those of peace seem at this conjuncture to lay the strongest claim to the genius of a young Englishman and I have no notion of that indolence which can be content to fall into the arms of beauty and prosperity without a single effort to deserve them If sir I have any tender interest in the heart of Emma as I think I have it has been more generously sought But why do I argue with so much gravity when perhaps you intend all this in the way of trial willing to see if my attachment  to my native country was not less than my passion for my mistress Yes yes this is your experiment You wanted to know whether it was appetite or affection that influenced me in regard to your daughter and you will not I trust be displeased to find the basis as solid as your friendship or solicitude might desire Adieu dear sir I thank you for the stratagem and glory in every success that draws me nearer to your heart Adieu  HENRY HAMMOND  LETTER VI  TO MR HAMMOND  POOR misguided youth receive the last kindness I can ever shew you receive my pity You will however in common politeness cease to render yourself unwelcome and save me from an appearance of inhospitality I think you ought as a man of honour to drop corresponding with Emma and let it seem to be your own act and deed selfsuggested and selfinspired This however your conscience will best settle To that I refer you As you so soon depart a few more letters cannot be very material Farther avowals of love however I shall consider as seductions  Farewell To wish you success in your undertakings would be to partake of your folly you will therefore excuse me I will only say what is perfectly true that I am extremely sorry for you Heaven place your feet in a fairer path In that you are going to tread Mr Hammond you may find havock and horror but never can find either honour or happiness  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER VII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  APPREHEND nothing from my intrusion sir I never enter any house whose doors do not move willingly to receive me What you are pleased to call seduction appears to me so absolute a propriety that I must take the liberty to persist in it I have reason to think the affections of your daughter are engaged I cultivated them under your approving smile and with your immediate sanction I have not a heart that can put on or cast off its partialities exactly as the opinions of a third personeven tho' he be a fatherhappen  to fluctuate It is Emma therefore and  only  Emma can prevail with me to stop the current of affection or of correspondence I refer you to  her  conscience since it is not an apt reference you make to mine I suggest no disobedience but shall never violate one tittle of that faith which as a voluntary bond of soul is firmly given by Emma Corbett to  HENRY HAMMOND  LETTER VIII  TO HENRY HAMMOND ESQ  INEXORABLE boy I shall urge you no more Here let all connexion close for ever When I permitted you under the fair disguise of simplicity which you assumed to seek the affections of my child I had no conception there beat in your bosom so sanguinary a heart Yet practise on her as you please she will return I trust to her duty and have done with her deceiver  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER IX  TO C CORBETT ESQ  HAVE a care sir You are going over perilous ground Do not as a Partizan extinguish what I feel for you as the Parent of Emma I obey so much of your injunction as is possible and desire this may be the last of our letters Yet I cannot finish without a few more sentiments The chances of war Mr Corbett offer no security from the plunder of the enemy My safe return to these shores is uncertain I may become a prisoner or I may fall That part of your correspondence therefore which relates to a political subject will be best in your own possession You will  find it inclosed No accident can tear the deposit from my breast but I dare not trust a less faithful asylum That Heaven may bless you and make us once more friends is the fervent prayer of your  H HAMMOND  LETTER X  TO HENRY HAMMOND ESQ  YOUR generous spirit charms while it distresses me O Hammond why have you thrown this new motive for relapsing tenderness in my way Why did you not rather add fuel to flame and strengthen my displeasure Cruel Henry Why will you not accept my friendship upon conditions so humane It is not even yet too late You still have it in your power to unite real happiness with true honour Labour I conjure you to bless me and yourself I pant to embrace you to give you the paternal benediction and to give you  with  it my only child  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER XI  TO C CORBETT ESQ  IT is not possible to be done in the way you propose though there is none other that I would not eagerly attempt Yet to leave my Emma's father alienated is to go with a dagger in my bosom O it will be sufficiently painful without the aid of such aggravation Let me implore you Sir to point out some  other  means of reconcilement Think O think  HENRY HAMMOND  LETTER XII  TO HENRY HAMMOND ESQ  IT will not  admit  a thought nor are there  any  other means within reach There is there can there  shall  be none  C CORBETT  LETTER XIII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  THEN let me beg of you to drop the subject and to believe in this farewell sentence that there is not a blessing in human life which is not sincerely wished you by  H HAMMOND  LETTER XIV  TO HENRY HAMMOND ESQ  YOUR ship will not be ready then to bear you into the paths of danger for some days How uniformly amiable is your solicitudedearest and best of friendsand how kind your attention to every circumstance that has the least tendency to affect my ease and my welfare I reflect upon your generous kindness with a kind of weeping rapture that wants a name but thank Heaven I find my nature sufficiently susceptible and my heart sufficiently enlarged to answer the demands which your tenderness and constancy are daily drawing for and though it be  a proud boast I will venture to say that in sentiment and friendship in good will and good wishes I can never die your debtor Yet this little delay my dear Henryinto what an exultation of spirit did it not throw us Last night my beloved friendoh last night the hours betwixt six and tenhave you any idea of a period that could be rated in comparison with them What a space It was all spirit and all soul Every inferior sense was annihilated and the registering angel if such there be can hardly have marked a passage more soft more affectionate more beautiful or more pure During the whole course of that precious interview alike elegant and ardent were  the expressions of our lips the flutterings of our bosoms and the feelings of our heartsnot a look not a word not a whisper not a moment but memory shall hoard with dearest care and dwell upon with increasing satisfaction Virtue shall be summoned to open her immortal page and transcribe the correct pleasures of last night amongst the whitest transactions of humanity O 'twas a lovely melancholy period that the heart will dwell upon with tenderest affection while it remains accessible to any soft impression After you left me my friend I continued still in converse with you or personally in vision pure or by the assistance of this little instrument as fancy took the  lead The bright scenes that were then paintedwith all their vivid images around mehow how shall I describe them Ah Henry the closer I look into your heartthe deeper and the more deliberately I examine and analize its properties the more I admire and applaud Oh my friend my most congenial and most amiable friend could I speak or write of the spotless hours which we have passed together with half the heartfelt satisfaction that I think of themmy language would be indeed eloquentit would emulate your own "Ye Prudes in Virtue say "Say ye severest" do I confess too much ah that I knew words sufficiently ardent to say more  I am unequal to the task It is pride and gratitude sensibility and softness Such are my fixed and solemn sentiments not spoken at hazard but grounded on the most perfect experience The propriety of my choice has been confirmed "Proofs have assisted Proofs and still the last is "the strongest"  Doubt not but I have read the sentiments which meant to reconcile me to your departure again and again as tenderly as attentively I have indeed perused and reperused them till the characters are almost washed away I only mean from the paper The impressions remain  uninjured  elsewhere O Hammond Hammond  how the soft emotions agitate the heart at the command of your affecting pen As I read your pages of this morning distress and joy complaint and resignation the tear of anguish and the smile of hope all struggled together In every pulse I felt the force of your tender eloquence It had power to smooth the rugged front of war and I represented you returning victorious from the battle Every varying sensation took its turn to reign at one moment I was soothed at another chilled What feeling of the soul did not alternately assert its dominion I was disturbed quieted agonized and made supremely happy Yet O my friend it requires an inspiration even brighter than your own to disguise  the tempest which is gathering around me and to render me insensible I am not prone to make any event in life a source of unnecessary misery On the contrary I have a strong constitutional propensity to content and a kind of resisting quality in my nature which disposes me to ward off all imaginary evil But the departure of Henry is  not  an imaginary evil It is a blow which however suspended cannot fail most deeply to affect whenever it falls and fall it must within the compass ofwhat a few daysah my God spare spare memdashthe tribute of my tenderness is streaming on my paper My hand trembles in obedience to the  terrors of my heart and I drop the pen  EMMA  IN CONTINUATION  I must add to this letter a few after observations which a reperusal of it has given birth to In the closing passages perhaps it may appear that I have said too much I am never quite satisfied with my expressions afraid from motives of the most delicate consideration left I should say too little or too much I often repress what rises to my lip and look cautiously with the mind's eye at every fond emotion before I dare venture to give it the stamp of language But you are going from me Ah go not  with one sentiment against your Emma If in compliance with the decent usage of the world or the prejudice of a worthy father or my particular sense of that precise decorum which it becomes every unmarried woman to adopt If Henry I have hence at any time been witheld from more cordial declarationsdeclarations which you might well expect in return for yours so ardent and so elegant  allow  for me allow for my sex allow for my situation Consider that I am a woman and a daughter as well as the choice of Henry  That  honour which is so dear to us both hath a claim to various duties My nature keeps such a jealous eye upon my conduct that an  instinctive something like the internal disapprobation of a wrong measure has often silenced the tenderest terms lest I should pass that sacred barrier which constitutes the chief delicacy in the character of a single woman Perhaps I have carried this scruple to an extreme but I could no more help it than I can prevent the tear from starting to my eye so often as I turn my thoughts towards a separation You have sometimes looked as if you blamed me but my error is at worst a little exuberance springing from a fair stem and produced in a good soil nor will my dear Henry think ill of me for indulging i  Acquit me then oh acquit me of all contemptible finesse and do not  believe that I can be one moment insensible unmindful or ungrateful  Your last letters my friend shall be preserved as reliques of virtue victorious over every selfish principle and whenever I sicken at the folly and depravity of mankind I will turn to those precious pages  there  feast upon the hidden treasures of a tender heart forget the silly pageants that form society and for thy dear sake be reconciled to the species Again adieu  LETTER XIV  TO EMMA CORBETT  THE delightful letter of my charming Emma is lying in my bosom as I take up the pen to reply It came to hand at my poor Louisa'sat the house of my languishing and lovely sister she told me she expected you I pass'd an hour of pleasing attendance after which it became painfulah  how  painfulYou did not come Why was this Yet it matters not It was not  possibie  or it was not  fit  The  fit  and the  possible  you know are the principles which govern our affection I wanted heroism nevertheless to support the suspense with decent composure  Louisa said to me with a tear assisting the eloquence of her expression"  What  brother hath not the long tenor of a sister's wretchedness and disappointmentdisappointment which is to last for  ever  taught you to bear the loss of a  single  interview "I felt the force of the appeal but continued to be uneasy My sister withdrew and my anxiety increased By way of mitigation I took up a pen which lay before me and marked with it my emotions I marked them my Emma in numbers "for the numbers came" Let them be acceptable Let the sincerity in the sentiment atone for any defect in the poetry Send me word that you are composed and let me meet you as  chearful as you ought to be in the morning Louisa will look for you by ten o'clock Poor Louisa ah that Edward had not fallenAh that the brother of Emma was yet alive that he saw the injuries done to this unhappy country with  my  eyes and that as much inspired by Louisa as I by Emma he was now making loyal preparation to fight the battle of Britain by the side of  HENRY HAMMOND  Verses written by  Mr HAMMOND  in the moments of waiting an interview with  EMMA  TENDER tremors touch the bosom  As the gentle hour moves by  Expectation almost weeping  Tiptoe stands in either eye  II  Ah what precious perturbations  Haunt the fancy of a friend  Half an hour of watchful waiting  Seems a period without end  III  When the clouds hang dark and heavy  Disappointment  o'er me low'rs  But as  fairer  fleeces favour  Hope bestows her promis'd flow'rs  IV  Soon again soft fears assail me  Since the visit is delay'd  Thenah then tis apprehension  Of a thousand things afraid  V  Haply sickness may detain her  Thus imagination cries  Haply pain or haply peril  Then this bosom bleeding lies  VI  Ev'ry step that strikes the pavement  Ev'ry summons at the door  Ev'ry sound of passing coaches  Warm and chill these pulses more  VII  Now I dread th' excusing message  Now I dread some dire disease  Too much wind or too much sunshine  Robs alike this breast of ease  VIII  Heav'n must make a morn on  purpose  To compose the gentle heart  Zephyrs bland must fan the season  Airs their softest balms impart  IX  Not a breath too  much  or  little  Not too hot or cold a ray  Must impede the expectation  When tis Emma's  meeting day  X  Yet perchance these lovely flutt'rings  Beauteous fears and kind distress  Do but serve the more to heighten  Tender Henry's happiness  XI  When the fair  indeed  approaches  Every rosy terror's o'er  After little scatter'd cloudings  Sunbeams only bless us more    Stanzas added when  Mr HAMMOND  was about to depart    XII  Thus the flow'r which blows at morning  Opens more and more till noon  Then as chilling eve comes onward  Ev'ry colour seems to swoon  XIII  But perhaps  tomorrow's  radiance  May rise  lovelier  from the rain  And the bloom which 'erst did languish  Shall revive to bloom again  LETTER XV  TO HENRY HAMMOND ESQ  WHATEVER is elegant beautiful or amiable in that fair blossom the human understanding under the highest culture is expressed in the correspondence of my dear Henry especially in the precious favour that was inclosed in his last billet dated from the apartment of Louisa Ah that Emma were an allaccomplished judge whose plaudits might reflect all the honour which my hero deserves to receive This being impossible let it suffice that you have in these tender effusions furnished your Emma with new proofs of tenderness though none were necessary  to compleat the measure of either sentiment in my bosom Yet such charming repetitions and innovations can never be unwelcome nor will Hammond refuse or overlook this unassuming tributethis humble and acknowledging page which simple nature and affection offers It is not the full foliage of the laurel but it is the little unobtrusive leaf of gratitude and love  Yet must I not and ought I not to tremble while I praise O this America my Henry These chances of war A theatre of mischief already fatal to the lover of LouisaI faint under the thought The time steals on even while I am talking of its  lapse Your virtues all known all triedall pressing on the eye and twining round the heart It is terribleit is too much In mercy be less kindless amiableless engaging Oh if you draw the chain thus closethus near if you bind the lovely fetter thus hardtill every comfort and every joy  depends  on the near and exquisite contact if you contrive thus to annihilate every object but yourselfto create a void in natureor fill it in my idea only by your existence and that existence is to be exposed to hourly peril what is to become of me Or when cruel necessity shall tear you from me which she is preparing to do how am I to support it Eancy sickens to  reflect upon the vast and formidable distance that is so soon to divide us To separate for such a purpose too How few hopeshow few consolations Correspondence will be delayed interruptedinterdicted The soft and sweet solace flowing from pen to pen will henceforth lie at the mercy of winds and waves Our sentiments will depend upon the terrifying circumstances of war We shall no longer breathe the same air repose in the same islandwalk under the same hemisphere but separationuncertainty and wretchedness must ensue  O dire and deadly spirit of contentionpatron of carnage and encourager of bloodshed O thou who  ragest most unnaturally in the human bosom where all the graces and the affections should inhabit and settest man against manThou who hast swept a brother untimely to the grave and a father a sister and a love to mourn his fate Thou whose spear seems now trembling over my panting heart which bleeds at the dangers of the youth whom I adoreOh mischievous WAR armed at all points against the happiness and humanity of the specieshow various and how dreadful are thy horrors  I cannot bear it Henry  Yet let me think a littleAre you not resolvedwhat then am I doing  labouring to unman you Ah forgive my inconsistencyI cannot help itindeed I cannot No words no pen not even your  own  my best friend alleloquent all Promethean as it is can paint the essusions of nature as they burst from me at this affecting moment Consider the fate of Edward and think of what may be your own consider the sorrows of Louisa and think on what may soon be those of Emma Yet what have I saidam I not satisfied with the most affectionate and invariable solicitude but I must interfere with a mode of conduct which you assure me is a duty not to be laid aside without dishonour Alas Henry I am reduced by this cruel commission of yours to a very  bitter exigence which neither permits me to censure or approve I dare not write any more for I feel the tide of overwhelming softness pouring on me Perhaps I might advise you at this tender crisis to  No I will not  trust  myself with the pen It would sully me in your  esteem  should I longer hold it O Henry Henry pardon and pity me Preserve  me  by preserving  yourself  Give not to glory  more  than is her due but make some  little  reserves for the trembling  EMMA  LETTER XVI  TO EMMA CORBETT  ALAS what is to be done with this bleeding tenderness of yours For Heaven's sake temper your sensibility with a little discretion my beloved Emma Your elegant and affecting pages penetrate me to the soul Thetears of anguish mingle with those of admiration as I read them Yet let me implore you to strengthen  your  mind a little lest you wholly debilitate  mine  Let not your Henry disgrace the cause he is to defend nor fully the profession he has chosen Dear unhappy friend make one great and generous effort to support your drooping spirits to sustain your wasting  frame and to preserve a life so valuable to  me  that the same stroke  I cannot pursue the subjectRouse rouse yourself my EmmaFor my sake let all your fortitude be exerted we are both young there is the same protecting Providence by water as by land in the fields of war as on the plains of peace The  future  is a wide space and may contain within its circle a thousand blessings Struggle then against the storm bravely Your inferences are too gloomy various opportunities will offer doubt not to speed our generous intercourse The wide world of sentiment and sensation  still opens upon us By aid of this little friendly instrument we may range through those paths which ocean seems to separate However remote you should still learn to think it a superior blessing that in some part of animated nature there still exists the counterpart of Emma congenial as dearone whom no circumstance can change but who must ever remain true to every touch of joy and every trembling of woe Look Emma at the paltry passions and vulgar gratifications of common lifeof common lovers Look attentively at these and then examine your own heartexamine mine Consider the pure nature of the affection that unites themDoes not the superiority  of our attachment make you generously proud O Emma you ought not to be wretched We have both reason to be content  Does Emma still weep Let her rather gratefully acknowledge that though this pure source of sacred amity is occasionally embittered as is more or less  every  affection of the virtuous heartthere are moments in which happiness breaks forth with a lustre that makes amends for every intervening vexation Such was the period when I wrote those hasty lines which you have honoured with most dear praise In striking the balance then let us not complain my friend but when fretting at disappointment  or drooping under the languors of distress let us support ourselves with the assurance that the rich current will return after all obstructions and flow sweetly and smoothly along its proper channels Its source my dear Emma can never be exhausted It is as the chrystal fountain of living water which streams for ever and suffers no impurity to remain upon its surface  Ah what is there so likely to melt the spirit of a soldier into cowardice as the tears of Emma She will not then give  way  to the tender torrent She will court the balmy blessings of ease and hope She will check these convulsive transports of distress so  destructive to my honour and her own health She will buffet the wild waves of adversity nor thus suffer them to overwhelm her Consider of these things O my beloved Emma Come then my friend be still yourself repose with perfect confidence upon that faithful pillow which my affection prepares for you seek to amuse and to solace cease to murmur and repine  Do these things and all your generous wishes shall be rewardedDo these things and all shall be well Peace shall revisit your gentle bosom and spread her whitest plumes about your pillow  HENRY HAMMOND  LETTER XVII  TO LOUISA HAMMOND  I CAN make no terms with this rash brother of yours He is predetermined Try  your  influence for the sake of Emmathe sake of your murdered Edwardfor your  own  sake and for that of him who  would  have been your father and who is  still  your most affectionate  friend  CHARLES COREETT  LETTER XVIII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  WHEREFORE in the closing scene of my life do you thus agonize me Is that consistent with the characters of parent or of friend My brother strongly imagines he is going into the paths of dutyThe hapless Edward though he trod on the opposite side imagined alas the the same If the intercession of Emma fails what can Louisa do I  every  way want power I want every thing but  resignation  to the sovereign will of Heaven to which I have brought myselfDo not rob me of it by reviving images which I have neither body or mind to bearbut leave me  Mr Corbett I beseech you leave me to the force of my religious principles without awaking the passions I have lulled On the day that my brother sails I shall set out from this hurrying town for my eternal retirenent  Farewell  LOUISA HAMMOND  LETTER XVIII  TO HENRY HAMMOND ESQ  HOW sweetly how elegantly you reprove me Hammond and how grateful how pleasing are the tears that I have shed over the pages before me I blush to think how far you surpass me Henry Hope seldom spreads her daydreams over  me  in those instances where her sweet delusions would be the most acceptable But  you  have  inspired  mePoor pathetic Louisa what would  she  give to have Edward even in the situation of Henry Avaunt then impious despair I am easierI am betterInfinitely easier insinitely better I give you my word and honour that I  am Yet the  dreaded  day is always obtrudingit appears like some malignant spirit crossing me at every turnat every step How perverse is human nature which disposes us to reject the joy in possession and anticipate sorrows which may never come O for the beautiful hour of your return my friend It  will  arrive Henry will it not and in the mean time your sympathizing tenderness shall be salutaryindeed it shall It  is  Melt you into  cowardice  did you say Heaven forbid Eyes instantly be dryyour tears will prove a heresy to the object of my heart O Henry you have touched me nearly The consideration  the single consideration of your  Honour  shall reconcile me to a separation Go thenpursue the ways of glory and Oh may they lead speedily to peace and  EMMA  LETTER XX  TO EMMA CORBETT  NOW then my ever dear Emma summon to your aid all your confidence and all your courage The separating moment comes on The sailing orders are received It is the voice of my country that calls upon mecalls in the hour of extremity She summons her sons to arm in her defence Shall I not hearshall I not obey her YesI have the sanction of my friendI go under the auspices of EmmaHer approbation is the animating trumpetHer virtue arrays me for the battle Methinks I now behold the lovely Emma beaming inspiration through beauty standing  before me Away she cries  away  Henry I yield to the graceful sacrificeI lend you to my King I trust you to BritainI give you in charge to that Providence on whose equity we shall ultimately have claim I submit Go then my HenryfarewellGo  As the vessels pass and repass my Emma we will faithfully interchange the affectionate enquiries we will with dear tautology repeat the vows which shall one day be solemnized But the parting adieus must this night be paid Let me breathe them into your bosom O best of women at the house of the lovely sister of my soul I will write no more Let the silent  tears of Louisa be as a check upon our complaints If patience can comfort  her  in the hours of  despair  surely pleasure might smile upon  us  in the moments of  hope  Consider the nature of the exigence that appeals to my firmness and do not take from me that forcethat ardourthat intrepiditywhich are publickly due in times like these to  your  country and to  mine  Adieu  H HAMMOND  LETTER XXI  TO HENRY HAMMOND ESQ  IT may not be my brother I cannot see you in the last hours of your stay in England I love you too dearly to support it It is not even now without pain I hold the pen My tenderness is too strong and my constitution too weak to bear such an interviewto bear the tears of Emma the embraces of my brother and my own distress Excuse me therefore It is true affection that persuades me to retire I will not unman you nor add to the weight of Emma's sympathy I will take my head from this weary pillow and set out for my cottage before you come This illegible  scrawl shall be delivered by the servant whom I will leave to attend you My wishes for you need not be repeated You do not want to be told how much I love you Yet I have one little request nor will you refuse it to poor Louisa  You are going to the spot where the dearest and loveliest of mensuffer me to call him so and do not oppose the voice of party to the language of naturelies murdered or if you like the term betterlies honourably slain  His memory is precious to me Henryhis  ashes  cannot be indifferent O if you could but find the  ground where he fellif you could but assure me that his sacred reliquesif you could but breathe over them one pioùs tear and one tender sighfor Louisa's sake But it is impossibleI feel my weakness and perhaps I shall infect you with it  Yet as your bosom is at this time full of love it is fitted for generous actions Should therefore kind fortune have allowed amidst the tumults of the war one little commemorating hillock of earth to the remains of EdwardO forget not to visit itforget not to guard it from further violenceforget not it is consecrated by a deluge of tears from a sister's eyes by friendship and by love Adieu  LOUISA HAMMOND  LETTER XXII  TO HENRY HAMMOND ESQ  THE appointment is made and I shall by a lucky arrangement be able to pass with you some hours of elegant distress Alas my friend my dear Henry nature will insist upon her tribute and I cannotindeed I cannotrefuse to pay it Yet you charm down the genius of grief by strong language and I love you I hope too much to dishonour you About the rights of conquest I know nothingI only know that as I lost a brother on  one  side of this bloody question so it is probable I may lose even  more  than a brother on the  other  and yet both persuaded me they were  in the way of their duty Alas how shall reason draw her line on such occasions Must not reason be dumb and humanity mourn But I have done Women are  surrounded  by calamities and nothing is left them but to bow in submission to their woe I am indisposed and beg you would allow me as much of thisOh how shall I write it  last  evening as you can  EMMA  LETTER XXIII  EMMA TO HER FATHER  Written in her Chamber previous to the Interview  YOU have found then it seems Louisa's billet making the offer of her house this evening to Emma and to Henry By what chance the note dropt I am ignorant The hand of agitation is not indeed steady nor can the agonized heart guard against common chances I am not sorry that the paper by whatever means has got into  your  possession oh my dear father It takes some part of the load from my bosom for I am hurt to appear plotting that which will so thoroughly bear explanation You  desire Mr Hammond to visit me no more He obeys You request that I would without enquiring into reasons forbear to speak of him to you I am obedient You desired that my utmost interest might be tried to keep him from America O you can conjecture how  readily  and as you know Henry's darling passion you may guess how  vainly  I undertook this The double pleasure of obliging you my father and of gratifying my own fond heart prevailed with me to urge this point till I had well nigh turned his affection to disgust You bid me cease to love and with the utmost ingenuousness I tell you it impossibleImpossible my dear father because repugnant to every principle by which  all the actions of my life have been governed  My regardO that is too cold a wordmy  love  for Henry is not you know the start of a moment the romantic sally of a warm temper nor the effect of that silly admiration which pays down the tribute of folly to the charms of a red coat I secretly grieve that the profession of arms should have been chosen I have shed too many tears to the memory of my  brother  to be in love with regimentals but my tenderness was antecedent to all these misfortunes nor will it be in the power of any misfortune to diminish what your judgment and the eloquence of my  own heart have so long approved Your present avowed displeasure against Mr Hammond is sudden but settled affection cannot readily accommodate itself to such revolutions What is rooted in nature cannot without much labour be eradicated by art As it displeases you sir I am concerned at this But shall I deceive in order to make my peace Shall I be  unnatural  in order to be  filial  Shall I propensely set one great duty against another and so destroy the excellence of both No You would hate me for it and I should hate myself That I am in this bitter period when I am about to lose what you yourself so lately thought most precious able to write with so much  argumentative composure is alas no sign of my indifference but an instanceperhaps the strongest that could be givenof that steady attachment which born of honour is nourished by virtue To be  attached  is the dictate of nature To be attached to a man of  sense  and  morals  is the dictate of delicacy and the symptom I conceive of a good dispositionSuch my most honoured father were the elementary rules I caught from you Would you controvert your own maxims Or while the merit of the object increases is it a fit time to withdraw from it the love which nature and common sense seem to say should increase in proportion  But you depend I find on the lenitives of absence and the oblivions of time I will not answer for the vigour of my own mind for I know the frailty of our nature If it is soothing to my father to count upon what these things  may  do let me not destroy his source of expectation I am not thanks to  his  correcter culture enough the giddy girl to burst forth into asseverations of  constancy everlasting  merely to vex a parent by  setting my heart  against his wishes I would desire rather to distrust my own temper and laying my affections open to his view beg him to form his judgment upon a survey of them But I dare not mislead one who hath so entire a right to be treated frankly  I make no vows yet in proportion as an attachment is deliberate is it not stationary and this being my first and only affection having besides a man of unblemished character and congenial manners for its object have I not a right strongly to suspectbut enjoy the opinion you so strongly adopt Bless you my father for the gentleness of your inhibitions You do not threatenYou do not rave These might have augmented my distress but could not have abated my affection A circumstance of which parents seem so unconscious they destroy the effect of authority by the vehemence with which they exert it They confuse but do not convince terrify but do not conciliate and almost  justify disobedience by their manner of enforcing duty  Oh heaven the clock is striking the hour is comethe minutethe moment is approaching I will ring for a servant to take this into the parlour My feet will scarcely carry me down stairs An ingenuous nature appeals to you for pity sirwill you refuse Oh my father my father my spirits have done their utmost ere the trial is begun Suffer me to be unhappyPrepare for meoh prepare for me the parental hand against my return and do not let  my  tenderness abate  yours  Adieu  LETTER XXIV  HENRY TO EMMA  After the Interview  TEN minutes while the chaise is getting ready are mine they shall be devoted to Emma Check I once more conjure you the extreme of sensibility a few silent tears a few gentle sighs and the luxury of a soft and tender sorrow I wish not to restrainbut such another conflict as that of last night  And yet I feel the absurdity of my own argumentFasten not however on any desponding images We  shall  meet again and in happier days  The sweets of social and family intercourse shall yet be our's and in the dear bosom of domestic peace we shall enjoy without constraint contrivance or disguise all the benefits of so delicate and well directed an attachmentTrust me we shall  Ah my Emma you owe yourself and me these reasonable encouragements and I implore you to bestow them If EMMA be not armed with fortitude how can HENRY expect to conquer It is too mighty a calamity to feel for her and for himself  The moment of departure is come I am called Adieudearest and most amiable of friendsadieu  Hah yonder is your servantHe is running towards meHe is here A pacquet Precious fellowtraveller I receive it just before I step into the carriage I hurry to press a wafer on this flying billet Heaven guard and give you its choicest blessings Farewellten thousand times farewell  HENRY HAMMOND  LETTER XXV  TO HENRY HAMMOND ESQ  YET yet a few words my loved friend and thenwhat then O adieu for a tedious spacefor days weeks months yearsperhaps for ever  Ah my poor heart  Yet it is not so this is the language of drooping nature in her most desolate moment It is our persons only that shall be separated our souls shall be drawn perpetually together in converse sweet communion high pure as preciousdelicate as delightful What alas is spacewhat is distance  Our hearts shall know no disunionI will not I  do  not despair  Henry I am less wretched than I was last night and though full fraught with tender sorrowthough my tears are flowing till they obscure my sight you may see their traces on the paperI will have faith in your prophecy  What a day for your journey it is emblematic of our affection inclined to sunshine and to shower to smiles and tears alternately Be tender of yourself for  my  sake Guard against cold from the poignant severity of the night air The dangers to which you will  professionally  be exposed are alas  sufficient oh do not add to them by neglect Farewell I will think of you very tenderly and pray for you very fervently Heaven bless sustain and comfort you How my hand lingersbut time grows short and unless I make one violent effort the period of getting this to your hand may escapeTherefore in one decisive and affecting wordFarewell  LETTER XXVI  TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND  MY DEAR BARONET  I HAVE not yet had one glimpse of opportunity to mention those proposals to my daughter which are so acceptable to me I can only tell you the young man is gone To deal plainly with you she is much attached but when you have cultivated her acquaintance I hope she will be judicious enough to make distinctions Follow your design of making my house yours till you go into the country and then many occasions will present themselves of discovering that merit which I am sure the generous  Emma will not be able to resist I am resolved against Hammond so that you need not fear a jarring interest A girl and boy inclination is fugitive Sir Robert Raymond will inspire I trust a superior passion on a superior principle Come to us immediately and join in our parties  Ever yours CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER XXVII  TO EMMA CORBETT  I FLOAT on the bosom of the ocean while I write this but as if in courtesy the wind is changed or rather it ceases to blow sufficiently and in this harbour we are to ride till it rises You well know in what manner I shall employ the interval it shall be dedicated to softness and to Emma I have perused your dear parting legacyno not legacy that is too funereal a wordyour parting pledgeYes I have perused it and soldier as I am do not blush to tell you that I have wept over its contents I pressed it with servent and chaste ardour to my lips and to my bosom  I laid it soft and close upon the panting heart and am relievedas much so my Emma as I ought to be or as is consistent with human nature at this crisis Oh my dear friend it is indeed a pathetic period I now feel that I had set myself too hard a task I pretended to rally it off as a military manceuvre but I find "he jests at scars that never felt a wound" Nature revolted and I have suffered more from not giving her fair play  There is no brother officer at my elbow and I may safely whisper forth my lovely weakness to Emma  The anguish of my mind  The anguish of my mind bore down all before it and now the matter is over I will confess that the last hour I pass'd in your company my friend was the most painful of my life How are you at this moment my Emma O how many questions have I omittedhow many have I yet to ask O for another hour At the end of the first stage I was strongly inclined to order the postillion to drive back I had recollected much and that methought of moment too to saybut I found it was only lingering nature reluctant to let go its object and would have amounted to nothing more than tender repetition It would but have enseebled both and deepened in each bosom the poignancy of  sorrow Again my dear Emma farewell May Heaven bring us once more within reach of each other  You  such as I wish you  Me  such as you would have me I shall now seek the bed or rather the hammock it is somewhat aukward to me The sea is not you know a soldier's element and it will take a little time ere I can fit myself to the fatigues of it  HENRY HAMMOND  PS O be very tender to my beloved Louisa Supply a brother's absence nurse her declining health draw as if by stealth the softest images over the solemn sadness of her soul and let not so much beauty elegance and virtue drop untimely into the grave  LETTER XXVIII  TO HENRY HAMMOND ESQ  THE wind stirs not there is not a breath of air moving in the atmosphere Under favour of this idea I am writing a hasty line just to wrap up with the inclosed which  my heart  recollected since your departure let it lie O my beloved Henry upon  yours  and may it have all the tender power which I wish to give it Ah that I could croud into a few words every thing sweet and comfortable to supply the defect of this brevity and to soften the ills and misfortunes which poor humanity is doomed to bear  EMMA  LETTER XXIX  TO LOUISA HAMMOND  OHOW tenderly you have spoken to a brother's feelings my beautiful sister It is a nice subject you have glanced upon but what is there in your Henry's power that he will not seek to do for Louisa Yet it was hard to withdraw your hand from meI missed the pressure even while Emma was weeping on my bosom and I had much very much for your private ear which I would have contrived to impart Preserve the inclosed papers which in case of accident you will unseal and act in conformity to their contents They are the last desires of your affectionate brother  HENRY HAMMOND  LETTER XXX  TO EMMA CORBETT  THE wind is still insufficient and the little which stirs is adverse which has given me an opportunity to receive the only part of your person that could consistently attend me on the ocean Do you know that this dear locket has made me poetical You must allow for verses written upon the waves Yet I hate apology They have soothed a pensive hour for me and may do the same for you  That they  may  answer this good purpose is the fondest desire of  HENRY HAMMOND  Address to a  Locket  with a braid of  Emma's  Hair  I  COME thou soft and sacred favour  The remembrance chaste impart  Take thy station on my bosom  Lightly lodging near the heart  II  While that tender thing shall flutter  Thou the secret cause shalt know  Whether pleasure or disaster  Thou wilt see what stirs it so  III  When the hope of happy tidings  Shall the sweet sensations move  When the white and winged agents  Whisper friendship whisper love  IV  Then all sympathetic thrilling  Thou the rosy stream shalt guide  While as runs the ruddy treasure  Thou'rt the  Genius  of the tide  V  Haply when this heart is sinking  Thou shalt soothe the rising sigh  When with woe surcharg'd 'tis heaving  Thou wilt see the reason why  VI  Ev'ry curious eye escaping  Here  securely shalt thou rest  Tho' the universe were searching  Thine the secrets of my breast  VII  Come then dear and decent favour  Learn what thou wilt ne'er impart  Fix thy throne and fix it ever  On the regions of my heart  VIII  O'er these delicate dominions  Cast a Monarch's careful view  Render every subject passion  Worthy me and worthy you  IX  Let not realms so rich so tender  Suffer rebel  weeds  to grow  But the flowersah do not crush them  In sweet vision let them blow  X  Gentlest sighs shall serve for breezes  Softly aid them auburn friend  Silent tears like dews descending  Shall the lovely growth attend  XI  Thou shalt watch them night and morning  Thou shalt see the nurselings rise  Thou with me shalt tremble for them  Thou with me invoke the skies  XII  If at length alas they wither  If they sicken if they die  In one graveoh dear companion  Still embosom'd will we lie  LETTER XXXI  TO C CORBETT ESQ  THE prospect Corbett is not clear I find but something impels me to try whether it may not be improved I suspect however that a youth of twentyfive in scarlet will leave an impression scarce to be erased by a middleaged man in a suit of snuffcolour with slash sleeves after the manner of our ancestors and it is too late now Charles to throw off a custom that has hung on my back for more than twenty years Yet I will come for I  want  the stability of domestic comfort after all my migrations  Your daughter strikes me as the very woman and has in my eye no other fault than that of being too  young  which I quarrel with chiefly because I strongly suspect she will think me too  old  No matter I will put the best foot forward and be with you in a day or two Mean time I will get me a new wig and to shew you how much I am in earnest will try to deceive your Emma as much as conveniently may be by ordering it to be made so as to resemble a responsible head of hair for I find since I came  home  from India there is nothing in a young Lady's eyes so ridiculous as a wig And when I  left  my native land a flowing peruke was a Cupid in  full dress  O tempora  But we will see what can be done  Dear friend I am yours and remember I  have  been so twentyeight years  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER XXXII  TO HENRY HAMMOND ESQ  WHAT a return have you made for the trifle I sent you O most dear and ingenious friend ever directing the current of that rich stream which knows no diminution but scatters fertility and fragrance as it flows to comfort to amuse or to instruct me How I rejoice that the bagatelle pleased you It was my first intention to have the hair disposed into an ornament for the shirt but I considered the nature of that delicate sentiment you feel for Emma I reflected that it was  retired  that it shunned every thing obtrusive that it could ill brook the idle and  perhaps the wanton curiosity of those cockaded heroes who imagine tenderness incompatible with bravery On these accounts therefore I chose to suit my locket to  that  situation only in which your delicate partiality would be most likely to place it  Round your neck my dear Henry let it ever hang impervious to every eye but that of the proprietorA sacred talisman may it provea soft shield thrown over your bosom by the trembling hand of a friendO that I could breathe upon it all the virtues that were supposed to be in possession of the most benevolent geniithat it had strength of charm sufficient to preserve you as securely  from sickness sorrow and mischance from the bullet and the sword as I do firmly believe the sight and touch of it will arm your heart against the impression of every error and the practice of every irregularity  Your letter with its fair and tuneful inclosure found me upon my pillow from which I hastened with a rapidity which is the spontaneous impulse of unaffected tenderness Like a much wishedfor and much wanted cordial it found me in an affecting moment I read and recovered wept and was well Oh wondrous power of virtuous affection Yes thou admirable and honourable friend the die is cast your invaluable love shall be the sustaining  taining solace of my future existence Ah may no jarring word or discordant thought ever rise up to disturb an amity so sacred and so pure The fine spirit of our esteem my Henry shall extend its delicate influence over all the rougher passages on a sea far more stormy than that whose bosom is now pressed by your vesselOver every troubled moment our affection shall softly diffuse itself  Like the sweet breezes of the South  Stealing and giving odour  Oh Henry my heart dilates as I write and the soft drops descend in a pathetic and sweet assurance of our future felicity but do not be uneasy that I weep such tears will not hurt  me They are precious drops that invigorate virtue and freshen as they fall Oh those sacred hours we have passed together in friendship in converse in books no divided attention thought saluting thought the mutual tear every thing or dear or elegant included in every moment Carry the remembrance of such intercourse over the world of waters Call to mind the time when our lengthened attention to the moral page instead of relaxing grew stronger and more fixed when our understandings and our hearts seemed equally to refine and to expand  Yes Henry I will try to adopt that gentle spirit of prophecy which  breathes so beautiful an ardour over your consolatory pages I do not  expect  to gather the bloom of the rose without feeling the puncture of the surrounding thorn I gratefully take it with all its little wounding appendagesI place it in my bosom  I have promised not to repine yet if a gentle murmur sometimes escapes let me I prithee find indulgence for it and do not chide me oh how often have I wished since your departure to be the companion of your voyage and all its consequences however multiplied however menacing And after all Henry your situation is more tolerable than mine the travelling friend has the advantage of  those who are left in solitude behind The very velocity of the motion is favourable in passing rapidly along the freshness of the air and the change of objects engage and divert the mind insensibly while the poor forlorn one that remains fixed to the former residence has only to mark the present period to look in vain around for what is lost to cast a "longing lingering eye" upon the past and in the torture of reflection to confess that such things  were  but  are  alas no more  It was my fortune to pass through the street where you resided more than once since your departure O think with what emotions I viewed  those windows which belonged to an apartment so lately yours The sight of your  grave  could scarcely have produced any thing more affecting and yet I feel that I shall like to pass often by them I do not pretend to  account  for these little touches I only simply  relate  them Will not your feeling nature easily explain them  And now confess Hammond that I have arrived at the due degree of heroism confess that I am sufficiently  soldier'd  for I can hold the pen and impress the quietseeming sentiment with my eyes full of tears and my heart full of sorrow What more can you expect from female philosophy What more can you expect  from a friend who has been used to regret the absence of an hour as a misfortune  I shall send off this on the slight chance of its reaching you If it should notwhat thenwhat will be its fateI care not Gross as is the world were every sentiment of my soul laid open to its view I could support the scrutiny I still could  "boast  the graceful weakness" if indeed it be a weakness of my heart The  possibility  of your receiving my letter is worth the hazard of dispatching it and as every moment is now at the caprice of the wind I will no longer delay sealing Adieu  EMMA  LETTER XXXIII  TO EMMA CORBETT  YOUR dear favour like a parting blessing comes to hand while the breezes are rising and the whole crew are engaged in the bustle of preparation We have already weighed anchor the sails will soon cease to flap against the mast for I perceive the mariners are climbing the shrouds to square the canvass to the gale which is at length favourable All hands are aloofAll hearts are panting with various passionsI feel that we are in motionI can hear the cleaving keel cut the wavesThe wind blows fresher as we clear the calms that brood in the harbour and  as I turn my eye astern of the vessel I behold the billows whiten into foam Alas the shore seems to go back and we are getting into a wider sea The watermen who have followed us thus far in their boat on some necessary business now tack about and prepare again to fetch the harbour  Brief let me beMany of my fellow officers are standing idle on the deck and some are roaring catches in the cabbin while Henry Hammond is writing an adieu to one dear woman who is the pride and pleasure of his life I confess also that a sigh is heaving from my heart and a tear is running along my cheek The officers look at me as if they suspected  an infirmity Let them In the day of battle we shall see whether tenderness or dissipation inspire the truer courage and magnanimity I have a little bribed the boatmen who are rowing laboriously after us but the last last moment is come and the last last adieus the finishing farewell must be given  farewell then  I leave you in full possession of my heart I leave you to your own virtue and to the Providence of GOD  HENRY HAMMOND  LETTER XXXIV  TO EMMA CORBETT  My brother and  your  friend then is gone how fares it with you my dear Emma Are the conflicting pangs of a parting so poignant somewhat subsided the tender spirits somewhat composed the fluttered agitated heart more still I ask you these questions in the bosom of my retreat I date from my sanctuary where my widowed heart for  that  has been long wedded is retired to muse upon the dead Of the living you one other person and Henry are the only objects of my care For your welfare and for your distress I can yet feel and while you remain in it the  world will have something that ties me to itthe rest is Edward's  Fifteen months of desperation are gone by my friend and five more have followed those less clamorous but more deep The frenzy of my soul is succeeded by the still small sigh and silent tear of settled sorrow It is not now the  passion  but the  principle  of grief Here I sit under the dark umbrage of these sepulchral boughsah shade most satred and invoke Piety to consecrate my griefShe comesshe comes my Emma  Amidst the modest shadings of the evening I behold her celestial form deseending on a moonbeam  Even now she diffuses a holy melancholy into my heartShe fits me for the contemplations that are most dearShe utters the name of Edward in tones of heavenly eloquenceshe touches the tender strainshe echoes the penfive sigh in softest cadence and increases the stream of woe with cherub drops of sympathy The lovely enthusiasm is compleat  It is now twilight my Emma the bat is taking its circles in the air and poor Fidelio is sleeping at my feetI use the day's last moment to write supporting the paper on my lap The owl which shrinks from sunshine has left his ivy and flits by meThe village bell is tollingThis  night departed the soul of a WIDOWIt is the  passing  bell then that I hearOh Heavens  Alas I meant to comfort you and I shall infect you with my gloom  The present sombre sweets be mineAdieuI lay down the pen till I can use it to a more soothing purpose  IN CONTINUATION  It is particularly unlucky Emma for you that I should have contracted this sequestered habit when my soothing cares might be so particularly acceptable to my friendYet  in the present situation of her heart all attuned as it is to  gentle  emotions I am much inclined to ask her society  The retreat is tender the weather is fair Close upon my cot Simplicity seems to have fixed her seat of "dearest residence" She has sequestered herself in a bower of shrubs at whose roots rambles the fertilizing rill My shades are formed to receive and to embrace the gentle spirit of acquiescence Reposed in the thickest foliage the saintly form of Melancholy also is there listening to the plaint of the stock dove and to the soft gradations of the waterfall Is not this an asylum for the  heart  of  Emma Even Louisa ah how preeminently wretched finds some consolation amongst these pensive sweets of nature in her solitudessolitudes my friend not to  annihilate  but  compose  not to  extinguish  the generous flame but to  attemper  it Ah come thencome to the woman who esteems youCome to the sister of Henry come to the mourner of Edward Retirement is the nurse of love 'Tis "hereabouts she dwells" Virtuous affection is blooming here amidst roses Friendship ah surely I might say KINDRED friendship in the form of your Louisa attends What of fost of sacred of serene is there  wanting  to invite you  Here  as farther removed from the tumults  of busy life you will be drawn more near to Henry Directing the telescope of imagination only towards  him  you will seem to approximate almost all of life that is most precious to us both The pure air itself will assist The softness of morn and the serenity of eve will be alike auspiciousthe sigh will become more soft the violent agitations will subsidethe tempestuous passions will sink into a delicate calm like the smooth sea "when not a breath of wind blows "o'er the sursace"  A little time passed in a recess so soothing will answer a thousand good purposes at present I know the tender heart must feel and the feeble  frame will suffer with it My own misery is not noisy and it will not interrupt yours The tears of sympathy which haply you may bestow upon Louisa shall be gratefully  repaid  In  this  way we will be at "once indebted and discharged"Attain therefore your father's assent and hasten to the cottager  LOUISA HAMMOND  NB I return the verses which Henry sent with the pacquet of pens because I cannot bear to keep any thing that is comfortable from you at this period especially any thing from our beloved Hammond whom we divide in dear affections between us  Verses from  Mr HAMMOND  to  EMMA  with a present of some Pens given at parting  II  GO ingenious artists to her  All ambitious to be prest  Dear disclosers of sensation  Agents of the gentle breast  II  Whiter than your whitest feather  Is the hand which you'll embrace  Yet  more  white the fair affection  Whose emotions you shall trace  III  Go and take a charge upon you  Passing tender passing dear  Oh the trust you bear

river  Lovely was your limpid way  Lovely was the silver surface  Lovely was your watry play  VI  But for pastime still  more  lovely  Your sweet feathers now I send  What  so  lovely prithee tell me  As the service of a friend  VII  Faithful to the fair deposits  Your  least  stroke shall reach my heart  In its elegant recesses  Shall be  fix'd  what you impart  VIII  Then dear instruments I charge ye  Often tempt my Emma's eyes  Bid her press your downy feathers  Bid her  speed  the soft replies  IX  Not the plumes which line her pillow  Half so delicate shall prove  When all kind her pulses tremble  As your downy shafts of Love  X  Ye shall note her joy and anguish  Gentle agents be sincere  Send me half each drop of sorrow  Rob me not of half each tear  XI  Beauteous as the dews

take this charge upon you  Passing tender passing dear  Oh the charge you bear is wondrous  Gentle agents be sincere  LETTER XXXV  TO FREDERICK BERKLEY ESQ  FREDERICK he is set off but I have no reason to imagine his embarkation a good omen As far as the  father  's interest goes I am safe but  that  does not go very far To tell you the truth I am  myself  somewhat an odd kind of a fellow in this respect I should not choose to accept an alienated or reluctant hand Nor could I sit quiet under the idea of possessing a woman who gave her person as an equivalent for a title and a fortune These niceties you will say are at my age some what  out of date  and I ought not to  expect  such etiquettes will be attended to by a'fine  young woman whom perhaps you imagine I might jump at on  any  terms Look'y' Frederick leave me to settle my own singularies and do you settle yours I think fit for old acquaintance sake to unbosom to you a very foolish secret The least you can do is to hear my story and to let me tell it my own way I am now in love  "nolens volens"  You may laugh but I  feel  it is not in my power to extricate myself Would the wench had not fallen in my way  These  are what I call cross incidents When a man is jogging on and has got soberly to the resting place  then  to have a slap on the shoulder from such an urchin as Cupid  then  to be attacked bow and arrow in handIs not this too bad  Is not this too ridiculoustoo humiliating  After you have uttered the sarcastic  yes  I shall proceed to acquaint you that this mighty ridiculous thing is the most  serious torment  and what renders it the more perplexing is that old fellow as I am it is a circumstance wholly  new  to menot more so to the veriest stripling when he wasts from him the maiden sighs for a tripping chit of fifteen I am not in my dotage  am  I Berkley at fortythree No hang it that is not what they call being wellstricken  is  it I have some terms to keep with  myself  too I should not  choose  to be  too  absurd  But this young adventurer This happy hero The parts of his character that I have been able to pick upsuch as health agreeableness genius spirit courage and animation are not absolutely in my favour are they Frederick  Let us see what I have got to put in the ballance  against  them The goutsmallpox pitsnot the ninetieth part of a museless courage than caution and spirits somewhat harrassed out in the real wear and tear of worldly events I don't like it Frederick It won't do My lighter scale is hurled aloof and I am bouncing my head against the beam most abominably O Frederick  Is there then nothing to throw in by way of bringing a middleaged gentleman on the equilibrium Yes A lusty lump of  money  The  golden makeweight  of fifty thousand pounds Fair force of  metal  Frederick Our cockaded spark has not any thing to poise  that  in the opinion of the world and yet if this should happen to be  Emma  's opinion I am so whimsical a mortal that I should esteem her  less  for the very circumstance which would make my suit  more successful  The The fortune of Henry Hammond I find is small He has  not  much money but he  has  what does a thousand times more execution in a delicate bosom he has  sentiment  O that cursed  sentiment  a term Frederick of  late invention to express old emotions in a new waya term which many use more affect few understand and still fewer feela term whichwhichin shortcurse that sentiment  We deceive ourselves my friend and in my next I will tell you  how  Good by' for the present  Your's ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER XXXVI  TO THE SAME  I SAID I would tell you how we deceive ourselves I will The  slender circumstances  and even the  great misfortunes  of a lover are no kind of objection in the eyes of a  sentimental mistress  embarassments of the world call forth the  finer  sentiments and those excite sympathy Now  sympathy  Frederick is in the female breast a very tender sensation It is a strange thing but a true that this same adorable SENTIMENT has ever had with indeed very few exceptions a most sore quarrel with solid silver and gold and with the coin current of a country In the account of young  English  women who are the greatest worshippers of the fair idol it really circulates as most  sterling  and the prevailing charms of a pathetic poetical poverty is a more welcome draft to them than any which mere  matteroffact wealth  could draw upon his banker Thus it is that fathers sacrifice to Plutus and children especially daughters to a beggarly Deity whom Plutus laughs to scorn and hence the source of tenthousand family feudshence the rise of separate maintenance and the fall of domestic confidence Sentimental Love is torn almost to tatters in his way to the altar and when in this effort his robe is  most  ragged  then  is his glory the  most distinguished  for  thus beggarly as he is he shall laugh at the labours of a  rich  passion and as he passes povertystruck as it should seem through files of females he will flaunt his famine in your face and  sentimentally  tell you it is his  letter of recommendation  And all this Frederick while plain affection in a snuffcoloured coat for instance throws in  vain  the massy money bag across his shoulders and seeks Hymen's temple by the path that is obvious and unentangled Nowadays the broad highway is deserted and the women rather  choose  to stick those roses in the bosom that are encompassed by  thorns  than accept the richest  boquet  in the garden that lies open to the view ready to the hand  and that may be collected without any difficulty  Difficulty  there it is again That is  another  cursed thing which enters into the spirit of a modern attachment It is the first cousin of sentiment or as I have heard its parent A sly old neighbour of mine who has looked shrewdly and silently at human nature and whom I sometimes used to consult on that subject tells me that  difficulty  is the happiest thing in the world to sentimental lovers I hinted to my friend in reply to this that I then might consider my age my dark complexion my wig and my fair round body as so many points in my  favour  since they would no  doubt throw a respectable quantity of the aforesaid  difficulty  in the way of my  wishes  meaning my overtures to Emma Corbett Aye quoth my friendbut they are not the right  sort  of difficulties There are continued he difficulties which  impede  and difficulties which  advance  Of the  former  yours Sir Robert happen to be the most substantial to which you might have added many more that have the kindness to attend you Of the  latter  you Sir Robert to my recollection have not one for you are too rich to experience an objection on the side of cash which by incurring the contempt of the father might possibly recommend you to the child You are too sleek and too plump to make  a young lady mistake your countenance for the seat of sentiment and there is so terrible an air of  plenty  all over you that you are in my opinion an unwise Baronet to address any thing but one of those  prudent  young ladies which in a matrimonial bargain cling to the  solid  comforts and will not like you the  worse  for being so abundantly provided with the goods of this lifeBut to attempt a woman of  sentiment  an ATTACHED woman of sentiment the mistress of a young  soldier  who loves a man of  poverty  a man of  poetry  and to crown all who loves a man that is not the  present choice of her father  Alas poor Sir Robert you may think yourself well off if she does not conceive towards  you a generous kind of aversion and order you to assume a genteel size to wear your own hair and to adopt the melting mood before she suffers a second visit Thus spake my friendand I don't know what to think of his doctrine Give her up I positively cannot Gain her is not a little improbable Yet I have met her several times since my arrival and she has not yet ordered me to assume a genteel size nor to wear my own hair I design to make some little alterations in the  headway  'tis true but this is more in frolic than seriousness for I love to adopt little drolleries They belong to my temper and have accompanied me to a very good end through lifewhich  I really find  requires  many little lifts to go pleasantly through  It is on this account Frederick that I regret having seen the fair Emma Corbett My partiality is not I find such a one as I can accommodate to my old habit of quaint jocularity It has a little jarred the harmony of my little system already I do not enjoy the passing scene quite so carefreeand why should I disguise any thing from Frederick BerkleyI feel an earnest desire to touch the  heart  of this girl  so  that I should be as necessary to her felicity as she is to mine and the fear of not being able to accomplish this makes me at times most peculiarly miserable  Thank discretion however she knows as yet nothing of the matter and I shall have the advantage soon of being under the same roof I could treat her with great tenderness indeed I could Frederick  Before I quite accede to the invitationthough I have written to CorbettI will consider about it and shall be glad to hear from you in the mean time But you need not write any of your objections to my pursuit lest you inspire me with a love of  difficulty  and I should like a sentimental Lover exert myself to oppose them in proportion as they appear insurmountable But you  may  send me word I am engaged in a hazardous undertaking  not doubting my success  if you please So I am  Your's ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER XXXVII  TO EMMA CORBETT  AH my friend you must not comeI am not  now  fit to receive you I am too gloomy and too sick My constitution will not keep pace with my mindThe physician summons me from hence O I would willingly live and die here but a certain something which at this crisis I am not at liberty to tell even to thee my Emma makes it a duty for me to protract life if it be possible and even to love it I can say no more and you are too generous to torture me with an enquiry  Adieu  LOUISA HAMMOND  PS I shall see you in town soon  LETTER XXXVIII  TO MRS ARNOLD  YOUR billet O Caroline is arrivedSurely the agony which threatens will not be added to the rest If it  be  the shortness of its continuance will soften its severity for in that case the tender mercies of God will be upon me and I shall die Ere this letter reaches you I will myself embrace all that remains of  O Caroline CarolineTears and terror prevent me from proceeding The post is setting out and I have time only to announce the journey of  LOUISA HAMMOND  LETTER XXXIX  TO LOUISA HAMMOND  Prior to the receipt of the above  BY all that is valuable to you I enjoin the utmost expedition Since I wrote in the morning the causes of apprehension are increased If the memory of Edward be dear to you lose not a moment  C Arnold  LETTER XL  TO LOUISA HAMMOND  Previous to receiving the th letter  WE  differ  about the rural shades my friend  I  adopt the  Poet's  opinion concerning them  What are the falling rills the pendent shades  The morning bowers the evening colornades  But soft recesses for th' uneasy mind  To sigh unheard in to the passing wind  So the struck deer in some sequester'd part  Lies down to die the arrow in his heart  There hid in shades and wasting day by day  Inly he bleeds and pants his soul away  But were I even to suppose with you that solitude my dear  Louisa  's pathetically  precious  solitude would woo to it the tender form of patience it  would at this period be impossible to take refuge like the hapless deer amongst the branches I have not been allowed a minute's breathingtime since the news of Henry's embarkation reached me It seems now the great point of my father to dislodge entirely all traces of Mr Hammond A father's  heart  engages in this endeavour and though I know it to be hopeless I forbear to disturb his plan by unavailing contest and am passive to the projects which surround ah how vainly the  honourable affiction  of my bosom The  acute  pang my friend is subsided but my affection is only the more fixed upon that account All places being now pretty much alike I suffer  myself to be drawn about from one silly circle to another Yet how should my father thus mistake my temper This affection is no impromptuNo enthusiastic flight of folly fancy or of passion It has been the slow progressive course of various combining and irresistible circumstancescircumstances which unfolding themselves trait by trait have discovered to me the merit of a most amiable character and on the basis of experience fixed me to it beyond all possibility of change So very complex peculiar and precious Louisa has been every movement in the series of events which have contributed to cement and fasten the faiththe HOLY faith established between  Emma and your brother that though no particular predestinarian nor easily yielding to the wild images of superstition I am strongly inclined to thinkand  there  is my hopethat something more powerful than the mere random agency of chance  must  have interfered I am not of the light or fickle tribe nor am I tumultuous Extreme violence I dread That pathetic sobriety which is separated on the one hand from the darkness of despair and on the other from the perilous furor of extacy if I at all know myself discriminates my character To the fortunes of Mr Hammond I am tied by those fine bonds of sympathy upon which time and chance can have no influence  Wherefore then should I not give way to the generous instinct You have often heard me say that I respect and venerate every rule which reason has prescribed to render female conduct correctly amiable and to preserve that beauteous decorum without whose graces woman is both despicable and wretched But does reason bid us withhold the mitigating balm which is given us to heal the wounds of life No my friend Your own heart virtuously attached to the memory of a most lovely and most lamented youth will plead in my behalf and justify my constancy Heaven itself will justify it and so will the unchangeable God who  inhabits  that heaven  To delicacy I grant much To qustom  all  which she  ought  to expect But to  nature  chastened and regulated by  real virtue  I devote my heart In devoting it to them I dedicate it to Henry and it is with equal pride and pleasure I am able to inform the sister of my dear Hammond that such has been the delicacy of his manners so uniformly pure his sentiments his tenderness so adorned by dignity so becoming a  man  to  offer  and a  woman  to  accept  ardent yet steady and soft yet bright that I do not recollect one word either spoken or written which  dying  I could wish to blot from the tablature of my memory If this was the praise of the poet what shall it be of the loverof the  lover young interesting approved of the most susceptible heart and a soldier And is one's affection for such a man to obey the motion of  wheels  and fly off as  they  roll along or is it to be buried in the  grave  of  everyday  society or is it even to be given up for the gaudiest trappings of tinsel life which never even at the most  unengaged  moment could fafcinate the eyes or sway the opinions of Emma  O vain thought O impotent exertion Would my father have me  flutter  into forgetfulness It is impossible Let him rather present to me a man  more  amiable  more  perfect  more  tender  more  engaging and  more  ingenious than Hammond Let him introduce to me a second Henry SUPERIOR to the first or let him forbear attempting to erase that lovely leaf whereon the virtues of that first are inscribed Yet I hold myself not at  liberty  to oppose the system of my father I maintain the modest purpose of my soul and cherish the vow which in the presence of an attesting God I have registered in my heart but I do not set myself  avowedly  against the pursuits of a parent At the same time I should esteem myself the lightest as well as the most unworthy of women were such pursuits to have any influence upon my faith Time may convince my father of the propriety  of a constancy so inflexible and to that I trust  May Heaven augment the comforts of us both Louisa  Adieu  LETTER XLI  TO C CORBETT ESQ  HELP me Corbett for I am a poor plain soul to conquer a little scruple or rather to obviate it that done but first that  must  be done I am at your service and will be at your house for I am tired of this tavern life in two hours Now then for it  Be honesthow stands the matter betwixt you and young  Hammond  Is he gone under the seal of any promise received from  you  I do not ask what  Emma  has declared She will answer me  herself  when I venture to refer to her But I want to know  whether  you  as her father have given him at parting any mark of approbation I must not be considered by these young folks as an impertinent old fellow who presumes upon  sum of money  and a paltry piece of  titleship  and so in the end become the object of derision to a whole family I understand that during my long residence abroad this Hammond was under your guardianship that he lived with you and Emma some years in the very house called Castleberry which I have purchased of you that  there  the young man was countenanced by you and his addresses to your daughter  not disapproved  Now as I do not hear of his having done any thing to  forseit  your affections I cannot  not conceive why you have as you say "resolved against him"  To be ingenuous I am afraid you think I am a BETTER  match  Look'y' Charles I am no hero but an honest man and you shall not break your word as many a  very  honest man  has  done in compliance with certain rigorous circumstancesLet us talk like old friends newly met  On my leaving England  I  was  poor  and  you  was  rich  In the roll of human affairs perhaps now that  I  am returned rich  you  may be comparatively poorthat is you may have somewise scheme to carry and cannot well bring it about I can no  otherway account for this sudden change in disfavour of Hammondfor you used to be fixed in your opinions than that impelled to an alteration by distressing incidents youIn short is there any hard part in your situation which you imagine an alliance with me might remove and  but  for this would not Hammond be as much the object of  your  choice as he is that of your daughter  Corbett speak plain What Cash do you want Let not your necessities violate your engagements Condescend to be a borrower where you may so safely rely upon your lender and where by contracting a debt you may confer an obligation To plead  for a rival would be unnaturalbut to save a friend from error and myself from disgrace is not amiss  An old and intimate friend of your's happened to step in just as I was directing my servant to carry my luggage to your house Your name was no sooner mentioned than he exclaimed"Poor Corbett how miserable must he be at the departure of young Hammond who is betrothed to his daughter Emma The youth is just gone a volunteer to America and if in that enterprise he be not shot he is to marry on his return Corbett doats upon him and a fine young spirited fellow he is"  This startled me but I said nothing I apply for explanation to  you  dear Charles Let neither your preference of me nor your private affairs aught avail I had rather be very unhappy than at all ridiculous My friendship is at your service just as you have occasion to shape it only I am sure on a little reflection you will not offer to give it the inhospitable form of infringing the rights of another Farewell  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER XLII  TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND  YOU force me into a very unwelcome explanation Unwelcome because  precipitate  and which I designed to have opened at a proper opportunity in the hour of confidence however as the circumstance is thus hastened on I must suit myself to it  I am not by any means so rich as I was at your departure from this country for India yet I am too richand should think myself so had I only one guinea upon the earthto many Emma to  your  fortune to mend  mine  I did love Hammond even with a father's love and in a legal sense to  be  his father was my favourite intention Yet that idea is now of  all  others the farthest from my mind and never can be revived It is a little hard that you have got me into such an exigence as to make it impossible for me with any credit to keep the great secret of my life  Henry Hammond is against all advice and persuasion violently attached to those cruel  spoilers  who have gone sword in hand into the bowels of a country where my dear son has fallen a victima country which is most barbarously butchered and to whose welfare I am bound by ties the most tender and interesting I would reject  you  I would reject an  EMPEROR that should pretend to the hand of Emma and yet sacrilegiously pollute his  own  hand in the lifeblood of AMERICA Oh thou hapless land thou art precious to me beyond the breath which I am now drawing beyond every hope that I can form on this side heaven beyond my daughteryes even beyond Emma because thou art equally the object of my love and more of my  pity  The rapacious HENRY is gone to plunge another poignard in thy bosomthe bosom of my countrythe tomb of Emma's brother and the vault of every generous affection Nature herself lies bleeding on thy shore and  there  the inhuman mother has plunged the dagger with her own  barbarous hand into the bowels of her child  But oh the deep and tremendous restitutions are at hand I see them with a prophetic eye this moment before me Horrors shall be repaid with  accumulation  of horror The wounds in America shall be succeeded by deepmouthed gashes in the heart of Britain The chain of solemn consequences advance Yet yet my friend a little while and the poor forlorn one who has fought and fallen at the gate of her proper habitation for freedomfor the common privileges of lifefor all the sweet and binding principles in humanityfor father son and brotherfor the cradled  infant the wailing widow and the weeping maid Yet yet a little while and she shall find an avenger Indignant nations shall arm in her defenceThrones and dominions shall make  her  cause their own and the fountains of blood which have run from  her  exhausted veins shall be answered by a yet fuller measure of the horrible effusion Blood for blood and desolation for desolation O my poor Edwardmy buried propertymy massacred America  You remember it was amongst my first questions that I desired to know  your  opinion of the war I received the answer which soothed my heart and it was not till after that moment  I suffered my full tide of ancient tenderness again to flow  To  Henry  I break  no  promise Emma's attachment I think may be  subdued  by gentle means O if she still unites her heart even her secret heart to that  volunteer  murderer these silver hairs shall descend in sudsden sorrow to the grave But indeed I do not apprehend it She is all duty She  loves  the source of her existence Come then Discover to her your virtues and try to save me from the distress of her preferring a rash boy who is bent upon destroying  those  which are so valuable to  Your CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER XLIII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  YOU astonish me I imagined  you  were like  myself  a citizen of the earth and of no particular party For my  own  part I have  travelled  away all enthusiasm of the sort you mention There is indeed something like a natural affection which one bears to the place of one's nativity because  there  our beings were first linked to the chain of society there first shot up our ideasthere grew our connexions our affections our hopes and our wishesthere our little loves were first formed and our little wants first accommodated It is upon these accounts that I am more  happy to contemplate the scenes of England than those of Indiathat I rate more highly my  own  than I do a  foreign  languagethat I look with fondest partiality at the spot which is marked in everlasting traces on the memory devoted to the pastimes of my infancy and that I continue some sort of grateful tenderness for the very  trees  whose shades so often soothed me in the summer of my childhood My predilection for my native country friend Corbett 'hath this extentno more' It has been my fate to travelI had almost saidwherever Europeans are dispersed I have travelled too where civil society hath yet made no progress but I have  never  travelled and oh  may  I never where the  "human face divine" did not meet my eye However varied by colour by tint and by feature I saw enough to discover my  kind  and to acknowledge it I disputed not about the white or black the tawny or the yellow nor about the different mixture shade or distinction of these I saw beings of the same erect formI saw MY SPECIES and in this very serious moment I declare to you that I felt attachment to the general figures of men and women wherever I beheld them even before I knew any thing of their particular dispositions In looking more close I beheld amongst every people whether savage or civilized many things to like and many to dislike but not  one  to cut  them wholly from my tenderness Foremost of those points Corbett which  hurt  me were the bickerings that subsisted between one state and another In passing through a variety of countries and seeing them  all  either  engaging preparing  to engage or healing the wounds of an engagement  past  I began to think the passion for honourable death ie cutting throats and lopping limbs for subsistence or for glory for pride or pique was universally peculiar to these ages of iron and steel till devoting a cool hour to examine the map of the world and perceiving that from the creation or very soon after even unto this day to shed blood in this manner has been the  constant practice  I gave up  the idea of calling my fellowcreatures cruel or sanguinary upon this account and  deplored  a custom which I could not  approve  Yet in every army are characters to be loved and the human affections spread themselves more or less over every clime In considering the  causes  of wars between different proportions of the same species of whom numbers without number have been slain I have found them so wretchedly inadequate to the horrible  effects  that I have often melted into tears but never have been inflamed with anger Tens of thousands my friend have been sacrificed to the frown of a favourite the whim of a prince or the smile of a prostitute The  occasions  are contemptible  but the  event  is murder What can a goodnatured man do but commiserate the abuse of power and the madness of ambition In point of  propriety  there is seldom a pin to choose on either side and even when it is Justice herself that draws the sword and heads the phalanx the blood of many an innocent is shed in the contest and in the warmest moment of success while victory is enjoying her jubilee if all the milk of human kindness were not drained out of the hero's bosomthere is as much cause for him to sorrow as to rejoice Oh Mr Corbett were he to retire  after  the shout of acclamation to some quiet solitude and there think on the means by which the conquest has been  gainedwere he to consider that heaps of his  countrymen  as well as of the  enemy all  of whom were human beings lie cut to pieces upon the plainwhile  another  heap yet more to be regretted are groaning in hospitalswould not the laurel wither on his brow would not the sense of rapture be checked sympathy stream from his eye and recoiling horror freeze up the blood about his heart Such are my opinions I caught them my friend from the fountainhead of a most touching  experience  They flowed immediately from the  wounds  of my fellow creatures Appointed to the office of surgeon at a period of  war  in the earlier part of my life it was the fortune of our ship  more than once to feel the shocks of public hostility I had so much business upon my  hands  that it was almost too much for my  heart  At the conclusion of the voyage an opportunity offered to quit my cruel station and I readily embraced it Since that time I have kept myself unengaged from scenes for which nature did not form me and I am not of any party I detest war and the  thoughts  of war but I sincerely wish well to every human creature That England is at variance with her colonies is unhappy In both countries I have friends who are dear to me In both I have property But I dare not lean either way lest I should unsettle that system of  general lovingkindness  which for a  great while has been the basis of my happiness I assiduously avoid political conversation and it is a certain prudence in  your  conduct which seldom suffers you to mention these things that makes me so pleased my dear Corbett with your society I am now too far advanced in life to begin the cares of a  partizan  but as I have some  feelings  I cut out some more  congenial  employment for them I love my jest I love my friend I love you and I love your daughter Your ardent principles now convince me that an alliance with Hammond would be to unite fire with fire I will therefore try for her father's sake and for mine how far Emma may be brought to like a  man of peace  I have  only to desire that you will consider me as one who remains  neuter  upon the same principle that  you  take a  side  viz because I  think  it is  right  and because I  feel  it to be  happy  This condition observed our ancient friendship will stand firm and I shall ever be  Your's ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER XLIV  TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND  AGREED Had Hammond remained neuter on motives of like benevolence I should still have loved a name which is now detestable so I beg you will not utter it again For my own part I  cannot  remain neuter My soul is on fireI breathe generous vengeance against barbarous Britain I own it and could I move this lacerated body out of England without immediate peril of a life on which my Emma has a claim I would not continue in a soil so accursed We now know each other's opinion and the subject disorders me so much when it is brought forward  that I most readily acquiesce in your wishes to drop it for ever My feelings must ever remain but it kills me to give them language Come directly I have prepared Emma for the society of an amiable man and have explained our long and intimate connexion Adieu  C CORBETT  LETTER XLV  TO LOUISA HAMMOND  YOU alarm and check my curiosity in the same moment Oh beautiful unfortunate Yet is it not a little hard to have any concealments with the sister of Edward and the avowed admirer of Henry Particular circumstances however justify what in general ones would be an unkindness and these I am convinced  sanctify  the silence of Louisa Sacred and embosomed beyond the reach of any participation be all that you desire to keep so I wait in patient tenderness the moment of fuller confidence and till that arrives will only assure you that I am connected  with every turn of your life and with every stroke of your fortunes but will suffer myself to make no more the premature enquiry All this I owe you in return for the solicitude you express for the welfare of Emma whose chief pleasure on this side the separating sea consists in the correspondence which she maintains with Louisa  After several days of tedious revelry the  hurry  into which my heart hath been precipitated somewhat subsides We have left the vapours of London and got into a serener system The house of a very  old friend  of my father's lately landed from India is now our residence and it  was once the residence of Emma and of Henry for it is that very  Castlebury  where my father who has since sold it to the present proprietor had used to pass with his elected friends some months of every summer Since his American misfortunesO pardon me the mention of themhe detests the country and has I find sold the whole property to the agent employed to provide a country house and some pleasure grounds for Sir Robert Raymond that is his name previous to his arrival in England The agent fixed upon this spot and it became the seat of Sir Robert before my father knew that it was to be inhabited by a friend Sir Robert is delighted with the purchase and my father rejoices  to see a domain that he once loved so properly disposed of  You  also remember this retreat for was you not the associate of our flowery infancyLouisa and Edward Henry and Emma formed the dear family groupeYou tell me it soothes you to indulge these sentiments but perhaps they may be too great a trial for the present state of your spirits and I forbear  Sir Robert Raymond our host is a broad set brown faced good natured very sensible man with some not disagreeable particularities a large fortune some time since bequeathed him and no sort of impertinence in consequence of it Humour serious  sense and observation divide his character He was bred to physic and in the earlier part of his life practised as a seasurgeon He is replete with anecdote and extremely assiduous to animate conversation without engrossing it  I  am particularly the object of his notice chiefly no doubt because he perceives I stand most in need of comfort and I return his civilities as well as the situation of my heart will allow  Yet with respect to the country I was somewhat mistaken my friend I happen to be fixed in a spot where every leaf of every tree appears  consecrated  An holy inspiration seems to breathe about meWherever I look  I behold a trait of HenryI tread the paths where arm in arm we have walked together and I sleep in the very  apartment  which was formerly devoted to  his  repose These are small circumstances Louisa but they cling close to the heartYes my dearest friend this place is not without some softnesses some seducing sweets agreeable to the present distress which bears upon my spirits However depressed however exhausted I am in proper feeling to  enjoy  such a retreat The tender lapse of the streams the balmy lightness of the air the serene quietude of shade the freshness of that verdure which at once charms and  cherishes  the eye the carol of the gentler kind of birds  the unobtrusive bloom of the softer kind of flowers  each  and  all  of these conspire to produce that weeping resignation which Louisa has described and which is the natural effect of a virtuous heart in disappointmentBut still I am unhappy Since I am not permitted to  talk  of the dear cause of my grief I  feel  more Some part of the sorrow which used to vent itself in language is now doubled by solitude and silence like brooks which murmur least when they are most profound I write this in a little rocky cavity that stands in the garden where at your beloved hour of twilight's soberest grey I have stept forth amidst the fanning fragrance of eve to meditate and to mourn But while I  write of my sequestration it is about to be disturbed for the tread of an intruder assails my ear it is Sir Robert RaymondAdieu oh Louisa adieu  EMMA  PS If I too much affect you check my pen  LETTER XLVI  TO EMMA CORBETT  AH no my charming sister I will not quit the claim I can bear it nowI wish to weepto weep plenteously for I am happy Oh the proud word I had lately such prospects of horror before my eyes that to find them thus unexpectedly  removed  makes me able to look at the light of the sun with a smile and  that  though but of a moment's continuance is happiness to a wretch like meGo on therefore go onproceed to amuse to affect to touch me All hail the varied emotions which your pen inspires Ah Emma Emma think what a bright  beam of bliss must break on the bosom of her whose chief surviving treasure is rescued from the jaws of DEATH Think O think what a PARENT feels when wounded in every finer nerve and then healed again alas what have I said How wild is transport Into what flights doth extacy carry the heart which is unused to a visitor so radiant Oh Emma  Edward is dead  and yet existence is at this instant accounted precious to  his  and to  your  LOUISA HAMMOND  LETTER XLVII  TO LOUISA HAMMOND  "A PARENT feels"I understand you not And yet such sentiments at such a time can surely spring from but ONE sacred source A  parent  feel O great God Louisa how am I to interpret thiswhat am I to think I pause from my  own  feelings in sympathy of  yours  yet what am I to think Consider my suspense Consider what you owe a faithful longtried friend Consider I am your own  Emma  LETTER XLVIII  TO EMMA CORBETT  YOU  are  Emma you  are  my friend  You  are to  me  and I to  you  all which is comprised in the sweet description that both have a thousand times repeated  "We Emma like two artificial Gods  Have with our needles created both one flower  Both on one sampler sitting on one cushion  Both warbling of one song both in one key  As if our hands and sides voices and minds  Had been incorporate So we grew together  Like to a double cherry seeming parted  Two lovely berries moulded on one stem  So with two seeming bodies and one heart"  And shall I longer withhold from you the new claimsclaims which yet  you know not ofto love me"What shall you think" O think of  every thing  that is  most  tender think that I have a title to all your  pity  to all your  affection  think that the sole pledge of HONOURABLE love is just snatched from the grave and think too that you behold the  widow  of the hapless Edward in LOUSIA  LETTER XLIX  TO LOUISA HAMMOND  A WIFE a widow and the mother of an orphan at least of a dear fatherless child  Married  to  my brother  and this the first difclosure I am all amazement all terror and all tears O explain the mystery Since  you  have begun suffer  me  to continue the same sweet language and to reproach you softly  Is all the council that we two have shar'd  The sister vows the hours that we have spent  When we have chid the hasty footed time  For parting usOh and is all  forgot  No no you will  tell  me all and be  indeed  the sister of  EMMA  LETTER L  TO EMMA CORBETT  I Have gone too far to recede and you  shall  know all though I have broken a trust and my conscience smites me I am  used  to  misery  but the  novelty of joy  was too much to bear and hath betrayed me To a very dear and gentle bosom I confess even to the sister of the man who had bound me in the bonds of honour and made secrecy a double duty Yet I will go on without reserve so soon as a firmer state of health will permit The exertion of my spirits is now succeeded by a worse languor than I have ever before experienced and I am reduced once more to the necessity of  addressing you from my pillow  Suspend  therefore your curiosity pity my weakness and pray for my recoverybut do not on any account come to me even should you hear no more from me for some time I know how to nurse my disorder and till all matters are explained I would not wish you again to see the sister of Emma and the widow of Edward O let my secret sleep in the innermost sanctuary of your bosom  Farewell  LOUISA CORBETT  LETTER LI  TO FREDERICK BERKLEY ESQ  BE so obliging as to tell me whether it is madness or dotage to which I am now reduced That it is one or the other provided it be not a mixture of  both  is now past question I cannot suffer Corbett to propose me to his daughter nor have I the confidence to propose myself And indeed the more frequently I converse with her which I take all decent occasions of doing the more I see her hear her voice and perceive the sense "distinct and clear" that is falling from her lips whenever she opens them the less am I able to speak nay the less assurance have I to  believe that so much merit youth and beauty will have any thing to say seriously to a fellow with so sunburnt a form and unsentimental a set of features as the middleaged Robert Raymond  She hath an affecting trick of shedding tears Frederick and of sighing bitterly which burst upon one so unpreparedly that though I knew them to be the effusions of her friendship for the young volunteer I could not find it in my heart to check them but let a few of the same kind steal down my  own  cheek in very  fellowship of sympathy  I should upon my word I  feel  that I should and I have not  sported with my emotions enough to disguise them  Yet I have never heard her mention the name of Hammond since her arrival at Castleberry from whence you see I am how dating Is not this strange I always thought the tongue was a traitor upon these occasions She LOOKS Hammond methinks but she SPEAKS him not I think I can interpret her eyes but  they  are indeed the seat of every fine sentiment and seem made to express every thing that is gentle and tender so that it is no wonder  You  friend Frederick are an adept in these matters Inform me  Little of this great world can I speak more "than pertains to feats" of salves and plaisters and therefore "Little shall I grace my cause In judging for myself"  I do really think I am engaged in a very unthrifty undertakinga lookingglass that happens to hang near the table on which I am now writing confirms me in this opinion There is such a palpable air of  confidence  in  supposing  I should succeed that had not the torrid zone scorched all the  graces cf the blood  out of my countenance I should certainly blush  I write you see in my old way but I am put sorely out of my old  road for all that It is after all a droll sort of defect I possess that of really thinking I am too old and ugly to be an object of a young woman's attachment Yet there is nothing very preposterous in this idea either Speak to Emma says Passion Dread a repulse replies Common Sense Then give up the point and think no more about it cries Prudence "Ah teach me how I should forget to think answers Love in the language of Romeo A pretty struggle this for a grave man of fortythree Frederick is it not Between ourselves I fancy that when I have procrastinated as much as possible played the fool with my feelings and made myself sufficiently miserable I shall  see the propriety of  escaping  an  explanation  and so make a match of it in the Temple of  Fancy  only where a man chooses his own mistress and can dread no disappointment After all I cannot but apprehend there is some little delicacy in this conduct It proceeds from a quick  terror  of becoming ridiculous Tender attachments and all the train of the sensations they produce are extremely graceful at five and twenty but when one has reached the wrong side of forty I do truly think the  belle passion  somewhat  outré  Yet hitherto having mixed but little with amiable young women and never with immodest ones the ardours of eighteen can scarce exceed my own and I am in  this first affection this first love for it is absolutely such as bashful and as awkward as a boy just ushered into the society of the sex "Tis passing strange" and perhaps "passing pitiful" but however you may enjoy the confession I fully feel all the  tremors  of  tenderness  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER LII  TO LOUISA CORBETT  "PRAY for your recovery" Oh how servently do I pour the petitionary prayer to the Great Restorer Dear as is the name of Hammond much as I love to write it and sweet as are the sensations which agitate my heart so often as I see it marked upon the paper there is methinks something more dear more lovely and more sweet in that of Louisa Corbett At least  her title  to use it seems to bring the  sister  so close upon my bosom and so soft upon my soul that I feel uncommon joy at the tidings A child tooa little  Edward  is it not so But I will restrain the  torrentI will forbear I will "pray for your recovery" and thenah then will you not have perfect confidence in your sister  LETTER LIII  TO FREDERICK BERKLEY ESQ  OF  bodily  disorders I know the symptoms but cannot decide with equal skill or precision about those of the  mind  Pray thou child of refinement tell me what are we to think of a young lady when she seeks occasion to converse with you when she chooses rather to chat and walk with a man of fortythree than with several  younger  and  handsomer  visitors who are now at my house and above all when she makes advances to pupillage and desires to become a scholar Yes yes laugh away but assure yourself that I have  hopes  for Emma has proposed by way of country  amusement during her stay at my place to  Faith Frederick you are such a grinner that I am almost afraid to speak  During her stay as I said at Castleberry to study the art of  Surgery  Now as this branch of knowledge can be of no real service to her I will let you know how I choose to interpret it  choose  I say so don't you put me out of favour with the conceit nor the conceit out of favour with me  I  choose  therefore to consider it as a decent way of telling me my friendship  ship is  not disagreeable  and this idea soothes me so once again I intreat you will not be such a raven as to  crock  the comfort from my bosom Alas dear friend half the hopes of this little life are delusive but while they delude us into happiness let us not affect to despise them Imagination is only a gayer name for matter of fact in  many  cases  think  so and  'tis  so If felicity be seated in the mind it must often depend upon the fair  shadows  of  opinion  and one may say without a paradox that these are frequently  substantiol  Adieu  ROBERT RAYMOND  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
