 ANECDOTES OF PHILIP LATE EARL OF CHESTERFIELD AND  Dr Johnson  A COMPARATIVE VIEW OF THEIR LIVES CHARACTERS AND MERIT AND  Extracts from their Writings  BY A STUDENT AT CAMBRIDGE  London  PRINTED FOR A CLEUGH RATCLIFFHIGHWAY  BY J SKIRVEN RATCLIFFHIGHWAY    Three Shillings and Sixpence sewed  ADVERTISEMENT BY THE EDITOR  AS all necessary Information concerning the Scene the Persons and the Scope of this literary Dialogue may be found in the following Introductory LetterI have only to detain the Reader while I tell him that it was written by a young Cambridge Scholar on a Visit at the House of a Noble Relation to one of his Intimates at College  INTRODUCTORY LETTER  MY DEAR CHARLES  ACCEPT with your usual partiality and animating goodnature the firstfruits of a petty but useful talent which your kind suggestion first tempted me to acquire  You may remember that in those attic evenings of our college when we happily escaped from less alluring  society to devote ourselves together to Demosthenes or Cicero you have often said that an early facility in writing shorthand would be a desirable acquisition for a young student who confesses a very ambitious but I fear a very vain desire to emulate in due time those demigods of eloquence Let me now inform you that when you see me again you will see a tolerable proficient in the art you commended Whether my proficiency has been most quickened by my friendship for you  or by my native ambition I shall leave my dear Philosopher to decide in one of those contemplative minutes when a recent perusal of his favourite Plato has augmented his characteristic propensity to scrutinise human nature  By the way as the greatest of philosophers are a little apt to forget their own private transgressions let me whisper to you that you are an absolute traitor for reading Plato alone especially as we had  agreed to read in concert the particular dialogues that our beloved Gray has honoured with his applause Treachery however always includes its own punishment and I have the illnatured satisfaction of being convinced that you have but half enjoyed what you have read in my absence Perhaps reading of every kind becomes more delightful and more improving when we share the amusement with a congenial mind As to dialogues we have you  know determined the point when in reading those of Cicero together we found that his animated and graceful composition received new spirit from the pleasing interchange of two friendly voices Perhaps you are not yet aware that you are at this moment reading a sort of preface to some new dialogues such is the present that I have desired you to accept I see your surprize and the persuasion that follows itbut in truth my friend you are mistaken Had  they been compositions of mine I should not by reminding you of Plato and of Tully have imitated the simple dwarf so happily alluded to by the lively Sternein presenting my littleness to your view I should not have presented to you the standard by which you might measure it Nor do I send you the production of any writer who being less dwarfish than myself and boldly endeavouring to emulate those literary giants has attained in some degree that marvellous  union of grace and vigour to which they are indebted for their immortal reputationWhat then do I send youIn truth a rarity and one I trust entirely to your tasteI send you a faithful copy of real and spirited dialogues that passed under the roof though not in the presence of a certain noble Lord whose name is familiar to you and where conversation you know is frequently said to assume a truly attic vivacityI do not tell you that the inclosed is perfectly  in the style of your idol Platoit contains indeed no sublime enthusiasm nor logical subtlety on metaphysical subjects but you will find in it what most modern readers would think perhaps more alluring an ample and free discussion of all the merits and defects in two eminent and admirable but very different writers who having lately closed their career have left the surviving public at full liberty to scrutinize to estimate and enforce their respective claims to immortality  As these writers have been considered as rivals you will find that the cause of each is pleaded with the affectionate zeal of an enlightened admirerAs it generally happens in pleadings of every kind each advocate is tempted in praising his client to indulge himself in some severe animadversions upon the opposite partyYet for the credit of both sides I am persuaded you will agree with me that the whole debate is conducted with a liberal disdain of vulgar prejudice and that all the  speakers advance no more than what the particular turn of their own mind had induced them to consider as the dictates of truth and justice  By the rambling style of their dialogue you will perceive tha  it was real conversation and no formal composition of sequestered studyAs you are so fond of close reasoning I mention this circumstance to obviate your objection to passages that I am confident you would otherwise consider as defectsAs to myself  being a less rigid votary to reason than my dear Philosopher I am ever willing to sacrifice a few grains of logic for an equal portion of spirit and freedom  But it is high time for me to recollect that instead of hinting to you the value of my present which might indeed be prudent or at least very fashionable if I were making a present to the public I ought to tell you as briefly as I can the particular incidents that enabled  me to send you this singular proof of my regard  It happened that in two days after my arrival here my Lord was obliged to leave us and depart alone on some private business for IrelandMy kind and accomplished relation assumed the privilege that she is used to take in the absence of her husband and became to use the title I give her in my idle raillery Lord Lieutenant of the Libraryno trifling dominion I can  assure you but of considerable extent and admirably peopled with subjects of every classYou will recollect the description I have given you of the noble room my Lord has allotted to his books and particularly the elegant and commodious little recesses in the apartment that are excellently contrived to admit a multiplicity of volumes Our little party consisted for some time of Lady Caroline  A fictitious christian name substituted here and in the Dialogues for the real title of the speaker  Note by the Editor  an amiable and old female  friend of hers with her brother the Colonel and your humble servant for the young people of the house are still abroad on their travelsAfter breakfasting in a chearful parlour that commands a view of the grove and the lake illuminated by the Sun as he rises we have constantly moved together into the library Here as my passion for books is known and indulged I have sometimes loitered in one of the recesses and peeping into various whimsical authors have utterly forgot  to join in the conversation and sometimes after giving the company a due caution not to talk treason I have endeavoured while I was screened from their sight to advance in my new crooked labour of writing short hand by catching the discourse of the moment One morning when I had thus employed myself I shewed my manuscript to Lady Caroline not indeed from the motive that influenced a certain philosophical shorthand writer who having a very talkative wife took down without  the good woman's suspecting his employment all she said in a week and presented to her a legible transcript of the whole when as my story goes the honest dame was so shocked by the horrid figure which her peevish loquacity made on paper that she rewarded the Philosopher for his elaborate tender and silent reproof by correcting her foibleI was equally fortunate though on a very different occasion My fair cousin whose conversation I must say has as little to fear from such an artifice  as any person's can have was amused with my work and as we happened to be alone when I produced it she thus imparted to me the project it suggested"You know my dear Edmund we expect our good neighbour the Archdeacon to pass a few days here you know what an idolater he is of Doctor Johnson and you know the Colonel's equal devotion to Lord Chesterfieldwe will contrive to engage these two literary enthusiasts in an amicable debate on their respective idols You  shall invisibly catch their dialogue as you have done this and to shew that we have acted with no insidious design we will afterwards allow them the liberty of perusing and if either desires it of burning the paperSo said so doneI have only to detain you from the dialogue while I tell you that as they are both men of a social and benevolent disposition they were so far from being offended by this theft of their words that each has had the goodnature to comply with my request  and not only revise but correct and improve his portion of the debate So that you receive their speeches like the authentic printed orations of our eloquent senators corrected in the closet and still faithfully breathing all the warm spirit with which they were spokenI should add that Lady Caroline set a sort of little trap for the disputants which caught them to our wishshe had placed on her own little table in the library a quarto volume of Lord Chesterfield with two of Johnson's  octavos upon it and had left open one of the latterthe device was successful and very speedily gave birth to the Dialogue which is now before you  TWO DIALOGUES c  DIALOGUE I  LADY CAROLINE  PRAY my good friend let me ask you what tempted you to smile in surveying the books on my table I hope it implied no censure on my choice  THE ARCHDEACON  By no means To confess the truth Madam I only smiled if I did smile  because their position hit my fancy as an emblem of justice  LADY CAROLINE  Of justicehow so  THE ARCHDEACON  It represented to my imagination the decisive triumph of the once indigent and neglected but truly great Moralist over the highborn and fashionable Wit whose vain talents were during his life the idol of his country  LADY CAROLINE  Have a care my good friendbelieve me  that  idolatry is not extinguished Remember my brother is close to you and such an enthusiast that if you  begin an attack upon his favourite he will give no quarter to your's  THE ARCHDEACON  I would not offend the Colonel for the world but I am sure he has too sound a judgment both in literature and morals to consider these writers on a levelHe may perhaps be partial to the memory of Lord Chesterfield from a personal acquaintance with that nobleman and if so I sincerely ask his pardon for having alluded to the public failings of his friend  THE COLONEL  Your courtesy my dear Sir is so engaging and I have in truth such esteem for your judgment that I could wish to think with you on all points I am  convinced indeed that we agree perfectly in all essential articles though our coats are so different in their colourand you who have the happy art of uniting zeal and moderation in matters of highest moment will I am sure be candid enough not to think me either a fool or a libertine for admiring my Lord Chesterfield As to my personal knowledge of him I can only say it was just sufficient for me to perceive in a few accidental conversations that the world were perfectly right in pronouncing him the politest man of his time But it is not on any familiarity that I can boast of with this accomplished personage it is on a deliberate survey of his life and character and a long intimacy with his truly attic compositions that I have founded my increasing  admiration of his talents and his merit  LADY CAROLINE  I told you our enthusiast would catch fire  THE COLONEL  Nay my dear temperate sister do not affect a prudish indifference towards an author you love Severe as he sometimes is and very provokingly so on your sex how often have you had the justice to join in my estimate of his excellence How often have we lamented together and with equal indignation that hypocritical or senseless torrent of obloquy which has been poured upon his ashes  THE ARCHDEACON  Consider my dear Colonel that the censure on your favourite which you represent as unjust has not proceeded only from a few individuals who might be eager to insult the memory of the eminent from the pride of ignorance or the malice of envy It may be regarded as the outcry of an offended nation A whole people can hardly be inclined to pronounce sentence on any writer with malignity and ingratitude especially on the dead But there are certain unexpected offences in the moral world which burst upon us with an aspect of such enormity as seems to force from the lips of every unprejudiced spectator the most rapid and  absolute condemnation There are some violations I will not say of religion and of virtue but of common sense and common decency which an honest attention to the good of mankind forbids us to tolerate or forgive I am afraid the sins of your favourite must be ranked in this unfortunate class For my own part I must confess I esteem it so dangerous a thing to pour the oil of licentious admonition on the blazing fire of youth that I wish his Letters had been destroyed And surely you Colonel who never exert the privilege often allowed to your profession of treating serious things with levity you I think can never wish to reconcile our minds to the horrid image of a father preaching adultery to his son  THE COLONEL  Good heavens my dear Sir is it possible that a man of your candor and discernment can join in the barbarous inference that has been drawn from the letter you allude to If we are to be condemned so cruelly on a few idle or wanton words that escape in some luckless or unguarded moment where is the mortal of sufficient purity to support this rigorous inquisition not your great Moralist believe me If Chesterfield must fall by such a scrutiny so indeed must Johnson Most of those who have heard the common anecdotes of this justlycelebrated writer have heard his reply to a person who once asked him what he reckoned the highest pleasures of human life It is well known  that he named the two grossest of our sensual enjoyments and without cooling the hot idea by one of his sixfooted circumlocutions Shall I therefore call your great moralist a preacher of gluttony and incontinence Truth and justice forbid yet surely I might do so as fairly as you arraign my favourite in consequence of a few sportive words in a private letterBut let us not play the inquisitor with an austerity that converts into a crime every casual expression and is pregnant itself with more evil than it professes to correct Let us judge of books and of men not from a few scattered failings in sentiment style or conduct but from the full and fair impression which a complete and deliberate survey of their blended merits and defects may leave upon our mind  If on this plain and ample ground you are willing to enter into a friendly debate on the different portions of censure and of honour that may be due both to Chesterfield and to Johnson I shall by no means decline the contest for though I am most willing to allow that the latter will have much the more able advocate I shall not despair of proving that my favourite as you justly call him was in truth "take him for all in all" as good a man as sound a moralist and as eloquent a writer as the renowned philosopher whom you particularly admire  LADY CAROLINE  I never heard a more tempting challenge and I trust the Archdeacon has too much spirit to refuse it As you are  two men whom we may safely lead into a warm debate without the slightest fear of its consequence I confess myself very desirous of seeing you engage Though opposite in your opinion and zealous in your nature I am perfectly sure that your controversy can produce no painful or unfriendly sensations in the mind of either and to me it will afford both pleasure and instructionit will enable me to settle my own confused thoughts concerning two authors whom I am fond of reading and who to tell you the truth both delight and disgust me to such a degree that I shall be particularly glad to hear the good and evil in both deliberately examined and candidly compared  THE ARCHDEACON  They are Beings my dear lady that will not admit of a comparisonWould you not be angry with me if I compared my honest friend Lion the noble mastiff who guards your magnificent mansion with the sly and mischievous Fox that has lately invaded your poultry Such a comparison only can be made between the generous Instructor whose lessons defend our virtue and the pernicious Wit whose writings only tend to circumvent and destroy it  THE COLONEL  I admire the spirit and ingenuity of your simile but like a ball thrown with too much force it rebounds so unluckily as to hurt yourself for I must inform  you that your honest friend Lion was almost condemned a few days ago to a violent deathand he might indeed have suffered with justice not only for arrogating to himself much more than his due but for mangling most ferociously an excellent little spaniel who dared to lap out of their common dish and whom he ought to have regarded as a fellowservant of equal value with himself in the sight of his bountiful and indulgent masterAfter telling you this anecdote I will not be so cruel as to add that I think you have pitched on a perfect emblem of your great philosopher Yet allow me to say that he certainly did not resemble your old philosophical acquaintance the Demonax of Lucian whose name has been improperly applied to him in the want  either of faculty or disposition  to play the dog  Peregrinus used to reproach him for laughing too much and being too familiar with people Demonax said he you do not act the dog well  See the Demonax of Lucian translated by Franklin and inscribed to Dr Johnson who is called by the translator the Demonax of the present age    THE ARCHDEACON  I allow your raillery its full scope I am ready to confess there was a surly grandeur in the character of Johnson He was used to spurn the effusions of vice and folly with a fervent and virtuous indignation that was frequently mistaken for brutal ferocity An incessant zeal for moral excellence was his ruling passion and he had an unexampled  power of extracting morality from every incident of life from every appearance in nature No man ever exerted more intense or more constant thought to search into the essence of all goodness on his own account and to render his researches beneficial to mankind it is on this ground that he is generally regarded as a teacher of true wisdom inferior only to the sacred writers themselves and it is for the interest of human nature that we should guard the glory of such a man from the petty cavils of detraction or the unintended injury of misconceptionFor my own part I should say indeed that I am more intimate with him as a moralist than as a critic In the former light I revere him as a second Socrates far superior to the first and surely you  Colonel who for a modern soldier are singularly disposed to moral contemplation you the attentive father of welleducated children you I say can hardly think of seriously comparing an author of this character to one whose compositions if I may venture to use the vehement censure of my indignant critic exhibit only  the morals of a courtezan and the manners of a dancingmaster  LADY CAROLINE  I thank you my dear disputant for blending politeness with your zeal I perceive that your tender respect to female ears has led you to soften one expression in the very bitter though concise invective you have quoted  THE COLONEL  We are perfectly acquainted you see with the sarcastic gall of your great Moralist But let me observe that the keenest sarcasms in general rather prove the virulence or at least the pride of the accuser than the vices of the accused Indeed your idol himself to do him justice instructs us how to value them when he says in this very volume  Observation daily shews that much stress is not to be laid on hyperbolical accusations and pointed sentences which even he that utters them desires to be applauded rather than credited  But let me read to you the close of this paragraph it is admirable  Few characters can bear the microscopic scrutiny of wit quickened by  anger and perhaps the best advice to authors would be that they should keep out of the way of one another  Here you find that your great Moralist thought it hardly possible for an author to regard his brethren but with an evil eye and justly perhaps we might exclaim on this occasion  His own example strengthens all his laws  He is himself the microscope he draws  Rarely indeed did he fail to magnify the defects of such as were placed before him though his own great qualities were blended with such imperfections that if the latter were shewn to us through a glass whose magnifying power was equal to his own he would certainly appear as the most enormous  monster that ever rose into philosophical reputation with bitterness of language and brutality of manners Indeed you may recollect that in his lifetime his own virulence was often retorted upon him He has been called you know "a respectable Hottentot" and the Caliban of literature But alas what is proved by sarcasms of this kind on either side Little more I believe than the lamentable prevalence of jealous and angry passions in the heated candidates for popular applause For my own part as I have though I am no writer a passionate regard for the real interest and glory of literature I am grieved whenever I see authors of great genius condescend to hack and mangle one another like servile gladiators to gratify the rabble instead of combating  in a common cause like free and generous citizens against ignorance and envy the peculiar enemies of their republic  THE ARCHDEACON  Here my good friend we perfectly agreebelieve me I lament as sincerely as you do the jealous infirmity of exalted spirits so very common among the professors of every art that many people consider it as necessarily inherent in that fine texture of the human faculties which we denominate geniusI am far from wishing to represent Johnson as utterly exempt from a natural defect which he had the rare magnanimity to own and the virtue to suppress for what can redound more to the honour of any man and especially of a professed philosopher than to have it justly said of  him that he assiduously regulated every improper movement of his heart by a powerful and majestic understanding  THE COLONEL  Rigid truth and justice I believe could never say so of Johnson but allowing you for a moment that they might I can easily tell you what would be more honourable or I should rather say what would render a philosopher a much more amiable being in my estimation and it is simply thisto possess a heart so kindly fashioned by nature that its own native benevolence should supply the place of your majestic regulator  THE ARCHDEACON  That is you prefer a readymade philosopher to one who has had the merit  of making himself In the quiet vale of private life where no sort of competition awakens the turbulent affections of the mind your undisciplined philosopher may be allsufficient But in a continual contest for popular applause where the faculties are ever on the stretch and where the passions frequently blaze in proportion to the activity of the intellectual powers in such a scene and such you know is the field of literature we must not I fear expect the gentle voice of benevolence to be attended to as it ought Authors we know are irritable to a proverb and how rapidly they are hurried into wilful or blind injustice to each other we see but too clearly from every period in the history of letters But if such are the infirmities to which their condition exposes  them ought we not to conceive a signal respect for that eminent writer who constantly exerted his philosophy and forgive me if I add his religion to preserve him from these excesses It is in this point of view that the character of Johnson appears to me particularly noble Where can we find an author who in running so long a career in the same thorny field has done so much for the honour of his profession and so little for the gratification of his private spleen Insulted and reviled as he was perpetually when did he write a vindication of himself or a satire upon his enemies It does him I think infinite credit to reflect that with powers particularly formed to make him the first satirist that ever existed he chose to exert all the energy of his spirit in moral  compositions of a very different nature in such as might invigorate the understanding without affording any food to the malignity of mankind At the time when we may suppose his resentment to have been most awakened when his character was acrimoniously delineated under the title of Pomposo by a satirist of great celebrity you may remember that he disdained to take any kind of revenge and I do not indeed recollect that he has mentioned the name of Churchill in any of his writings His great mind was aware that in some kinds of contention the very act of engaging is disgrace He perfectly understood an important truth which few indeed of his fraternity have had spirit enough to confide in or temper sufficient to attend to I mean a maxim which he  expresses most happily himself in closing one of his admirable Ramblers and if my memory deceives me not it runs thus  Whatever be the motive to insult it is always best to overlook it for folly scarcely can deserve resentment and malice is punished by neglect  THE COLONEL  An excellent maxim I grant you in many cases and it reflects as much honour on the preacher as a good sermon on humility would reflect on a certain prelate of our acquaintance whose general demeanor might lead us to suppose that he knew not even the name of that virtue The forbearance of Johnson according to your own account of it was the offspring not of charity but  of pride He did not throw indeed upon paper any deliberate invective against his opponents but we learn from the diligent retailers of his conversation that his common discourse was a continued stream of sarcasms against all who did not blindly acquiesce in his dogmatical decisions so that the commendation due to his pacific conduct if rigidly examined amounts only to thishe never drew out his heavy artillery against his enemies because he thought that he could demolish them with less trouble and more security to himself by the snap of a pocket pistol  LADY CAROLINE  Come come my dear champions this is but an idle and I think an  unfair sort of skirmish I must be the arbiter of your contests not only as to the issue but the mode of conducting it Like the president at one of our ancient tournaments I must see that the knights engage only in a generous and friendly conflictLet each be as zealous as he pleases to maintain the honour of his own idol but without reviling that of his antagonist I proscribe therefore all bitter sarcasms as poisoned weapons that ought to be banished from our lists To drop my metaphor which I confess I cannot very well support let me remind you that I expect a full and candid comparison of the two illustrious authors whom you respectively admire  THE ARCHDEACON  My dear Lady the very idea of such a comparison is enough to make our lately departed Moralist feel a spasm of indignation in his grave  THE COLONEL  If we might literally interpret one of the many poets whom your Moralist has vilified and exclaim with Gray  E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires  then indeed I should apprehend that the dust of Johnson might be disturbed by our comparing him to a writer whom he seems to have hated with theological bitterness and whose reputation he attempted to stab with the short but envenomed  dagger of a vindictive monk But though I am far from thinking your favourite so virtuous and pure a character as you seem to do I can readily believe that his soul is now happily purified from that leaven of sour infirmity which debased I must confess in my estimation his singular and exalted powers I can believe that if his ashes were indeed insulted by any indecent outrage which Heaven forbid his spirit now like that of Pompey described by Lucan  Would smile at the vain malice of his foe  And pity impotent mankind below  Believe me I am so far from being an enemy to his memory that I think his writings and his life are both worthy  of being studied In both we may find much to admire and emulate with much to censure and avoid With both I would only wish to take such liberty as he seems to allow where he tells us that  if we owe regard to the memory of the dead there is yet more respect to be paid to knowledge to virtue and to truth  Rambler N  o      LADY CAROLINE  Very well my dear decent brother After your paying so serious and just a compliment to the grave of his revered Moralist I think the Archdeacon cannot in courtesy decline your challenge or imagine that the honour of his client may be wounded by a candid discussion of his cause  THE ARCHDEACON  Before I speak a word in reply to the Colonel allow me to ask your Ladyship one whimsical questionYou know that we all love and revere you as a matronly model of female virtues Conscious of such a character should you not blush with indignation at the thought of being compared to the celebrated Ninon or to any more accomplished courtezan if any such can be found in the annals of gallantry  LADY CAROLINE  Your question is indeed rather whimsical and if I wished to evade it perhaps I might justly say in the language of our lawyers it is not a case in pointBut as I am eager to promote  the friendly debate to which my brother has invited you I will be very frank in my answer and tell you my genuine feelings on your fanciful supposition If the odd comparison you suggest was candidly made and chiefly to shew what a different assemblage of virtues and failings may be found in different situations for all mortals you know have some failings and I am far from thinking those of Ninon the only blemishes that may be found in our sex if I say your odd comparison was conducted with that extreme delicacy which it certainly requires I believe  THE COLONEL  Believe indeed my dear prudeCome if you are not confident enough to speak the true language of your  heart let me be its interpreter and say you are convinced that such a comparison would rather please than offend youThere is a simple female secret which every man who has studied the fair sex with moderate assiduity and intelligence must have discovered and it is thisThe women who are most faithful in the practice of virtue still delight in being told that they are equal in loveliness to the famously elegant daughters of frailty and I question if the cunning Ulysses himself could have flattered Penelope more agreeably than by telling her she was as graceful as Helen  LADY CAROLINE  I am not surprized at this sentiment from an idolater of Chesterfield But  I will answer your maxim by another which approaches I believe much nearer to truthThe men who fancy themselves most deeply skilled in the science of reading the female heart are generally the greatest strangers to its most delicate sensations  THE ARCHDEACON  Your Ladyship is certainly right a true knowledge of the finest work in the creation is not comprehended in the gross or vain ideas of a libertine  THE COLONEL  I vehemently protest against your applying that title to my client as I have engaged to prove him as perfect in his morals as your celebrated Sage  LADY CAROLINE  Be calm then my dear enthusiast for what I want to hear is a full candid and simple statement of the real merits and failings in the two celebrated persons we are canvassing I wish to have a fair comparative estimate of both according to your own plan of considering them first in their general character as men or citizens secondly as moralists or periodical lecturers on life and manners finally as writers regarding only their style  THE ARCHDEACON  Pray do not repress the Colonel's enthusiasm because he is one of the very few men who may grow warm in a bad cause without catching any infection  from the depravity he defends indeed however paradoxical it may sound it is his own goodness that makes him the zealous advocate of vice for the truth is he has himself so generous and pure a heart with such a quick delightful perception of elegance and wit that he gives the possessor of these enchanting qualities unbounded credit for virtues which were foreign to his nature  THE COLONEL  I ask your pardon my dear flattering encomiast I must not allow you in thus holding out an unmerited and dazzling crown to your antagonist to trip up his heels without beginning to wrestle You mistake me entirely if  you suppose that I consider my Lord Chesterfield as a perfect character  A faultless monster which the world ne'er saw  or as even possessed of that true greatness and purity which some of our English worthies have attained I only say that with splendid and most engaging talents he had neither more nor worse vices than your exalted Philosopher and that he is no less entitled to the kind remembrance of his country This I think an impartial discussion of their lives and compositions may render as evident as it is that they were both beings of the human species  LADY CAROLINE  However strong and sincere you may be in this opinion I doubt a little your being able to persuade even our candid Archdeacon to agree with you and I believe the good folks of the world in general who delight in that short and easy mode of proving their great love for goodness which they find in idolizing a name for imaginary perfection these good people would be shocked at your idea and perhaps exclaim against you as a horrid profligate endeavouring to confound all the principles of right and wrong but as we give you full credit for motives directly opposite to these I beg we may pursue this amusing disquisition Some familiar words of Johnson that I have just  recollected suggest to me a plan for pursuing it in the fairest and most satisfactory manner You may remember in the journal of his fellowtraveller when he is displeased with Lord Hailes  for publishing only such memorials and letters as were unfavourable for the Stuart family he say If a man fairly warns you I am to give all the ill do you find the good he may  Do not you recollect this passage my friend I am sure my brother does because though I cannot repeat the whole sentence regularly I know it ends with those remarkable words  I would tell truth of the two Georges or of that scoundrel King William  words I believe that have had no little share in kindling the Colonel's animosity against your Philosopher  But let us adopt the preceding maxim of one giving all the good and another finding the ill Let the Archdeacon begin by setting forth every thing that tends to exalt and throw a lustre on his favourite Moralist my brother may add the dark touches but without any sarcastic aggravation of the defects he may discoverThen exchange your office let the Divine freely display all the vices of Chesterfield and the Soldier appear I will not say his defender but his apologist  THE COLONEL  Agreed  THE ARCHDEACON  Your Ladyship is undoubtedly very good to assign me only that sort of task  in which my duty and inclination may go hand in hand for according to your instructions I have only to shew the genuine dignity of the genius and virtue I admire and to point out the real deformity of that dissolute elegance which has made I think too favourable an impression on the fancy of my friend Yet honourable and pleasing as I must own the office you have allotted me I must also confess what happens I believe very frequently to men surprized by unexpected honours that I feel my mind dazzled and bewildered by the splendor of my charge and that I am distressed by no little fear of disappointing your expectationBut let me reflect how I may best shew my obedience to the spirit though not the letter of your command To enumerate all  particulars that do honour to Johnson is what I am illprepared to do and what indeed could hardly be done in conversation for it would be to give an extensive review of a long laborious life continually ennobled by new acquisitions of knowledge or by new acts of goodness and magnanimity I must content myself with only stating to you as forcibly as I can a few of the most striking considerations that have conspired to impress me with peculiar veneration for this rare and exalted character Let me remind you then that he was the son of a petty provincial necessitous bookseller that so far from having received any external advantages from nature his figure was hideous even in youth to such a degree that Pope you know was afraid he could  hardly be admitted as a preceptor into a noble family from the horrid convulsive distortions with which he was afflictedGood Heaven when I consider from what humble and disadvantageous obscurity he started and what pure eminence he attained although penury deformity and disease were conspiring to impede his advancement I not only perceive the marvellous merits of the man but feel a sublime delight in contemplating the native powers of genius and the genuine dignity of science supported only by virtue  THE COLONEL  Forgive me if I remark a little mistake in your estimatewhat you consider as impediments in his way were springs that pushed him forwardFrom  his own account of his feelings he must have had such a constitutional indolence that I question if any motive less cogent than poverty would have induced him to support the burthen of literary labourexcept perhaps his second spur of personal deformity which  in a great Wit  to use the words of your old philosophical acquaintance my Lord Bacon  is an advantage to rising  Bacon's Essay on Deformity    But I ask your pardon for interrupting you so soon as I dare say you have many more observations to favour us with that may fall within the first division of our subject as my sister has chalked it out for us and illustrate the character of Johnson as a man  THE ARCHDEACON  Recollect my dear Colonel the beautiful verses that you repeated at breakfast with so much enthusiasm and with perfect sympathy in the sentiment they express  Ah who can tell how hard it is to climb  The steep where fame's proud temple shines afar  Ah who can tell how many a soul sublime  Has felt the influence of malignant star  And wag'd with fortune an eternal war  Check'd by the scoff of pride by envy's frown  And poverty's unconquerable bar  Beattie's Minstrel    Thousands have had the aid of those springs which you consider as instrumental  to the elevation of Johnson but how few have risen I will not say to equal but even to similar distinction Recollect that from an obscure necessitous and unsightly being he raised himself not into pomp and opulence for he had a noble contempt of both but into that more enviable eminence of character which enabled him to associate with the rich the powerful or the accomplished and made him universally revered as the great teacher of morality to the most enlightened nation of the globeIf we survey him in the period of his early difficulties and distresses in that state which has induced so many needy adventurers to act the part of a literary Thersites and obtain a miserable stipend by ludicrous scurrility or declamatory malevolence  how different how pure and I may say how magnanimous was his employment When his first prospect of supporting himself as a poet was blasted by the failure of his Irene a performance I own that could not succeed for his genius was confessedly not dramatic his high spirit disdained to debase itself either by flattery or detraction the two ordinary resources of an indigent disappointed author He sought a refuge from the miseries of want in working on that useful that stupendous monument of literary labour his dictionary or in producing those periodical papers which are justly regarded as masterpieces of moral admonitionInstead of finding him betrayed by penury into vicious or dishonourable occupation we find him not only labouring most laudably  for the real good of mankind but leading a life as pure as those sublime lessons of morality which he bestowed upon the worldWe find him though under the pressure of indigence yet contriving to exert that virtue of noblest lustre which most dignifies the opulent and the great I allude to his charity which was so perfect so truly christian that he was ready to share the little pittance he had with any brother in distress more necessitous than himselfRecollect I beseech you that marvellous effort of a great and a tender mind the composition of his admirable Rasselas in a few days and nights for the purpose of relieving a sick and indigent motherHeavens my dear Colonel if such an act of literary heroism had been displayed among your admired  Athenians they would have raised a statue to the author in some distinguished part of their city and have worshipped him as an amiable demigod whom filial piety had exalted to the stars  LADY CAROLINE  Well observed my good friend you will certainly make a convert of me for tears start into my eyes whenever I hear a great character celebrated for uncommon tenderness or generosity to a parent and I am wonderfully disposed to admit that single virtue as a sufficient proof of perfection  THE COLONEL  I have ever allowed that there are several glorious points in the character of Johnson you have seized and displayed  them very forciblyI perfectly comprehend your pointed address to me concerning our old friends the Athenians You allude to my having said last night that much as Johnson had been celebrated for his intimate acquaintance with ancient literature there is not a particle of true atticism or of Roman urbanity in all his compositions I really think sobut of that when we come to speak of his writings At present I am to confine myself to his character as a man and in that point of view you must forgive me for saying that however great his faculties and virtues may have been they were evidently balanced by imperfections of equal magnitude and weight As to your remark on the marvellous purity of your Moralist in domestic life I will only make  this short replyIf I thought it decent or fair to pursue such a scrutiny I am convinced by the report of his associates that we should find his early days as much disgraced by actual licentiousness as those of my noble client whom you have called a libertineBut woe to the man who from wanton or malevolent curiosity attempts to violate the sacred recesses of domestic privacy for the mischievous satisfaction of exposing the secret or forgotten sins of the illustrious dead Far be it from us my friend  To draw such frailties from their dread abode  I will not therefore allow myself to speak of any but his most open and selfevident  imperfections These indeed were so great that whenever I review his character in my mind he is one moment an object of my idolatry and the next of my abhorrence For if I recollect what you have so justly commended his noble readiness to relieve the distressed I remember also that he was an absolute Cain who could not bear to behold the accepted sacrifice of a brother Indeed he assassinated not a single Abel but continually levelled his murderous sarcasms against the literary life of all his numerous brethren the whole tribe of our contemporary authors I believe it would be impossible to name one of this tribe to whom he ever gave a full and fair portion of praise untainted by envy and if we review his poetical Biography we shall find  his detractive malevolence most conspicuous in the lives of those who lived and wrote in his own time  THE ARCHDEACON  I will not attempt to extenuate the baseness of such envy by calling it universalon the contrary I am persuaded it is by no means so common as we imagine and we may thus account for the frequent imputation of this hateful quality where it has not really existedAll human works must have some imperfections and in every art a professional judge will see and feel these with peculiar quickness and force He may fairly describe them according to his feelings yet his description being much stronger than the impression which the object has made on less qualified judges  will to them perhaps appear as the suggestion of envy though in truth it is no more than the natural result of intelligent and keen perception  THE COLONEL  Your reasoning is so ingeniously goodnatured that for the honour of literature and the arts I shall wish to find it generally trueIn the case of Johnson however I am so far from being able to admit it that I am convinced if we can on any occasions exculpate him from the charge of envious detraction it must be on very opposite principlesnot from the warmth and acuteness but to speak in his own phrase the frigidity of his feelings We know indeed that he was not fashioned by education by habit or by the original texture of his  frame to enjoy any nice discernment of real delicacy in life in manners or in composition In truth it is hardly possible that such discernment could exist in a man whose common behaviour was as coarse as his passions were turbulent and who shews us in every point of view that detractive malignity and overbearing arrogance were his prevailing characteristics  THE ARCHDEACON  Surely I may retort upon you with more justice that it is not possible for these odious qualities to have prevailed in a character whose name is held up to public veneration by such a little host of recording friendsin a man whose talents and virtues afford such ample ground for panegyric that his  death has almost converted the whole circle of his acquaintance into biographers or memorialists  THE COLONEL  Well might the ghost of Johnson exclaim with poor Jaffier in the tragedy  Hide me from my friends  For it is indisputably true that his moral character has sunk in the good opinion of the world in proportion as the memorials have appeared which were designed to do him honour Indeed it frequently happens that an injudicious partizan does more mischief to his idol than the worst of enemies But as the little flock of his biographers  though certainly not birds of the same feather are all amusing in their way I am far from wishing to strengthen my arguments in our debate by treating them with asperity I shall only say therefore what if the lady who leads the band were present to hear me she would not I trust consider as any breach of that courteous respect which is surely due both to her sex and to her talentsI shall only say that this little tribe of biographers strike my fancy as a group of busy children who having got a gilt shilling are very eager to exhibit it as a guinea each rubbing it with an air of confidence to encrease its golden lustre but shewing alas at every rub still more of that baser metal which  they are all so solicitous to represent as gold  THE ARCHDEACON  Not so my good friendLet us rather call them an honest philosophical set of people who in analysing a magnificent mass of the richest metal tell us truly the real weight of the pure ore and fairly exhibit the little portion of natural dross which their experiments discoveredBut to quit our metaphor and speak the plain language of truth and reason Is not the incessant kindness the lasting veneration which Johnson has received from his most intimate associates a full proof in itself that his excellencies as a man and a companion were infinitely superior to his failings What  more touching test of merit can we desire for any character than to find that he was revered even to idolatry by his friends Does not the high reputation of Socrates rest solely on this foundation He has been the idol of succeeding ages because he was justly idolized by those faithful and accomplished recorders of his companionable perfections Xenophon and Plato  THE COLONEL  Assuredlyand as often as we review their affectionate accounts of him particularly the very sweet and simple portrait exhibited by the first we sympathize in the tender enthusiasm of the friendly memorialist But what would the world have thought of the great  Pagan Sage if his fair and elegant friend Aspasia had left us a little book of philosophical anecdotes in which we might read that the great philosopher had rewarded her for allowing him a noble apartment and all the comforts of her magnificent house by teazing with argumentative and imperious petulance her good aged mother What would the world have thought of him if Xenophon had given us the narrative of an excursion made to amuse his instructive master by shewing him the bleak mountains of Thrace and had told us that when he presented him to his venerable old father who dwelt in that country the Sage instead of entertaining his respectable host with colloquial wisdom worried him so ferociously that the  luckless disciple must have wished for a muzzle to secure his parent from the mouth of the outrageous brute whom he had ventured to lead from Athens to a distant province for the sake of shewing him as a consummate philosopher Again I may say what would the world have thought of him if the sublime Plato himself had represented his admirable instructor as the most selfish and disgusting glutton that ever appeared at a tableSuch are the points of view in which your favourite Moralist has been exhibited to us by his various biographical associates Your excellent memory my good friend will readily suggest the passages to which I have alluded I am far from suspecting all or any one of these writers of a treacherous intention to degrade their  heroyet what enemies could have contributed more to his degradation as a man in the eyes of every candid and impartial readerI will not say it has happened by their fault let us call it rather a fatality for the accomplishment of literary justiceand it affords us an incentive to universal candour and benevolence to contemplate the man who had written the lives of many with a great portion of detractive malignity destined to have memorials of himself so written by a succession of his friends that his character must sink in the public esteem exactly as fast as their friendly records appear  THE ARCHDEACON  I cannot agree with you for I cannot perceive in my own mind the effect  that you suppose universal I cannot perceive that I ought to esteem him the less as a man of virtue because I am told it was his custom to eat in eager silence though I confess it does not appear very consistent with the delicacy of friendship to commemorate a peculiarity so disgusting  THE COLONEL  Well my good friend we will not argue this point In favour of your great Moralist I consent to strike the name of gluttony from the catalogue of vices But allow me to ask you if you could revere even the Pagan Socrates as a philosopher on finding him deficient in those primary constituents of a great moral character justice and fortitude  THE ARCHDEACON  Most certainly not and let me add that my veneration for Johnson is partly founded on my idea of his having possessed those noble qualities in a superlative degree  THE COLONEL  To me he appears defective in both Indeed we violate the name of Justice when we suppose her to have dwelt in the spirit of a man who incessantly detracted from all eminent characters and who hardly allowed any mortals to differ from him in opinion without representing them as worthless or insignificant yet Johnson for some time contrived to support a moral reputation as marvellously as Mithridates supported  his life Your Philosopher after fortifying his good name by many tumid sentences of morality ventured on such envious gratifications as would have been immediate death to the credit of any other man and the chemical king of Pontus you know as historians inform us after breakfasting on antidotes ventured to dine safely on poison  THE ARCHDEACON  Take care my lively friend that you are not hurried yourself into the very injustice which you impute to my Philosopher I allow you that his strong and gloomy imagination very frequently discoloured his judgment I lament the prejudices which led him to insult the poetic genius of Gray and the genuine philanthropic heroism of our political  saviour King William Yet many allowances ought to be made for the prejudices of his early life and that terrific structure of his nerves which gave so dark a tinge to his mind As he courageously spoke his true sentiments on all occasions it is surely evident that he possessed the spirit of intentional justice at least and of unquestionable fortitude Where he was mistaken let us rather pity his errors than emulate his acrimonious severity  THE COLONEL  With all my heart when I have once convinced you how very far he was from being that accomplished practical Moralist which you seem to have supposed and how inferior at least in my estimation to that calumniated nobleman  whom with a proud baseness peculiar to himself he first complimented and then insulted without any real provocationSuch was the justice of your great Moralist who has indeed as little claim to critical mercy as any man can have for he was himself a black hussar in the field of learning who never gave quarter or I should rather say he displayed his powers with a cold phlegmatic inquisitorial cruelty and as an ecclesiastical friend of ours said the other day with an extempore paraphrase of the famous old verse in Ovid  On their own rack 'tis righteously decreed  Bloody inquisitors themselves shall bleed  THE ARCHDEACON  Pray observe my honest but too warm avenger of injustice how your accusation by its own vehemence defeats at least a part of itself The force with which you describe the barbarity of Johnson surely tends to clear him of your second charge the want of courageIndeed no charge can have less foundation I question if there ever existed a man who displayed more invariably in the character of an author a more absolute exemption from cowardice  THE COLONEL  So far from it that you shall find he represents himself as a most pitiful coward and that too on one of those occasions  in which every man is allowed to assume the language of heroism Every lover let him be as unlike a hero as he may is privileged by nature to tell his mistress in a song that he will banish her vexations and protect her from all the world But what says your brave author in singing to his dulcinea why truly this literary Caesar of yours cries out like a poor splenetic pretended Philosopher as he was  Tir'd with vain joys and false alarms  With mental and corporeal strife  Snatch me my Stella to thy arms  And screen me from the ills of life  Now put the stanza into prose and his amorous entreaty is this  I am too great a coward to bear pain either  in mind or body pray protect me my good bolder girl and hide me with your petticoats from the horrors of my existence  LADY CAROLINE  Oh abominableSir this wicked brother of mine is laughing at us simple folks for our serious attention to him I am confident he does not give us his genuine sentiments for three days ago I heard him praise the easy natural tenderness of the very lines which he has now travestied so unfairly  THE COLONEL  Well if you will not take my present remarks for sound criticism you must at least allow that they equal in  truth and candour those critical observations which the great Moralist has made on Prior Hammond cBut to be very sincere with you I perceive from this conversation how very apt the mind is to take a strong bias in every controversial career for since I began to compare Johnson in my thoughts with one of my literary favourites whose memory I think greatly injured all the imperfections of the gloomy Moralist have been so multiplied and magnified in my fancy that he strikes me in this moment not as one but an assemblage of unamiable charactersin religion a slave to superstitious horror in politics a servile bigot in familiar society an insufferable tyrant I give you my real opinion as it rises in my mind  How far that opinion is the result of delusive prejudice or of a fair though rigid estimate you are certainly qualified to judge because I profess to have no knowledge of the character we are discussing except what I have derived from his printed works and such memorials of him as are generally known If I am wrong I entreat you to correct me for I wish not to injure any being alive or dead and without retorting upon him the vile abuse which he bestowed on King William I will copy his language so far as to say I would tell truth of a splenetic savage  THE ARCHDEACON  You are certainly too severe and for this reasonthe foibles of Johnson lying  if I may use such an expression in the superficies of his character disgust you to such a degree that you do not allow yourself to search fairly into his deeper and more noble qualitiesBut as it happens in his language when you have once digested his hard words you feel yourself invigorated by the strong reason they contain so with regard to the man if you are once reconciled to the roughness of his manners you will clearly perceive his many Christian virtues for which indeed he might have obtained credit more readily had they not been so rudely covered Yet we cannot deny the merchant to be rich who abounds in gold because he keeps it in a bag of the coarsest texture  THE COLONEL  Your illustration is very ingenious but not perfectly just Though I agree with you as to the coarseness of the purse I cannot allow your gold to be genuineTo speak more seriously on a serious subject I am aware that Johnson is held up to our veneration for the sanctity and soundness of his religious character but surely my dear reverend friend it is an injury to the divine doctrine you profess to consider this man as the model of a Christian I can admit with my whole heart that he was a sincere believer in Christianity but to my apprehension no real believer ever succeeded worse in seizing the true spirit of our indulgent and animating religion His piety great as it is called was so far from being perfect that it neither  taught him how to live nor how to dieit neither inspired him with benevolent gentleness towards his fellowcreatures nor with a chearful reliance on the beneficence of his God  THE ARCHDEACON  Without an ostentation of meekness towards men it taught him real humility towards his Maker His piety appears to you debased by an excess of terror but surely it argues not any weakness or depravity of spirit to tremble before the throne of the AlmightyIf indeed the gloomy cast of his devotion could require any excuse is it not sufficiently excused by that morbid hereditary melancholy which preyed upon his mind and rendered him with all his rare faculties not less an object of  pity than of admiration This idea instead of diminishing increases my respect for his characterassuredly it does him honour to reflect that by long and profound meditation he was himself the architect of his virtues and that his imperfections were woven into the texture of his frame His marvellous merits were all his own and his blemishes the work of nature  THE COLONEL  At length my good friend we meet on such ground as I have not the least inclination to dispute with youBelieve me I am as willing as you can be to consider the failings of Johnson as constitutionalall I contend for is this that with so peccant a constitution he may not be proposed to us as a model  either of morality or religionThe ancient philosophers who maintain you know that virtue is not to be taught without the assistance of a proper natural disposition would have not only denied his actual possession of consummate virtue but the possibility of his acquiring it since instead of looking on the face of nature with true filial tenderness and gratitude his gloomy spirit made him regard her only as a malicious stepmother who exerted her ingenuity to embitter▪ his existence An affectionate delight in the visible creation appears to me as necessary to perfect morals as the spring is to the perfection of the year How utterly destitute of that sentiment your great Moralist must have been we may clearly perceive by his indignation against an  humble and blameless woman for pretending to be happy in such a worldYet dark as this state of existence appeared to him he could not practise even the wise precept of his pagan friend Juvenal and to quote his own spirited verse  Count death kind nature's signal of retreat  When I find him so inferior in real purity and strength of mind to the pagan moralists I should think myself absurd indeed if I revered him as a model of Christian excellence especially when I recollect that with all his profound reverence to our blessed religion he seldom opened his lips without sinning against the spirit and the letter of the  Gospel in calling a brother foolI am as ready as you are my good friend to ascribe both the gloominess and the asperity of his mind and manners to the vitiated organs of his very wonderful frameindeed the more I contemplate his character the more I am convinced that the distemper which afflicted his body if I may use a scriptural expression entered into his soul I am willing therefore to consider his defects rather as misfortunes than as crimes although they appear to have operated against his happiness with the double force of calamity and of guilt For with uncommon powers to support either bodily or mental exercisewith all the advantages he derived from his successful labour and the liberal kindness of his more intimate admirershe seems  to have been through every period of life a very miserable being and no one I believe were it possible would consent to purchase his rare faculties by submitting to resemble him in every particularBut whatever the sum of his imperfections may be after that is substracted there still remains such a portion of real merit as will probably secure immortality to his name and writings Believe me I am so far from being an enemy to his fame that I heartily wish the public would discover a more liberal disposition to pay him sepulchral honours The subscription for his monument seems to languish in a manner that reflects disgrace on this opulent and polished country I wish my good friend that you and I knew how to quicken the munificence of the kingdom  on this occasionThe nation that wishes to be ennobled by the production of future great characters ought to be splendid in her memorials to departed geniusI am amazed that the zealous admirers of Johnson have not been more eager to render him this tribute since his title to such a distinction is admitted by those who had no personal attachment to the man and who even think him as I do a strange compound of the most attractive and most disgusting qualities that ever met in the formation of an authorBut I have said full enough and perhaps too much of his failings Soldier as I am I assure you it is more pleasant to me on this occasion to defend than to attack Let me turn therefore from your respected Moralist and hasten to the vindication  of my injured favourite the elegant the witty the accomplished Chesterfield  LADY CAROLINE  Not so fast my dear hasty advocate I cannot suffer either of my two disputants to evade any of the points that they have undertaken to debate Pray recollect that you are still to discuss the merits of Johnson as a writer  THE ARCHDEACON  Madam the Colonel is a soldier of too much experience to be very eager in attacking a fortress of any kind that is secured by art and nature against every assailant Let me be allowed to call the miscellaneous essays of Johnson a heavendefended city whose palladium  is pure and perfect morality As this can neither be overthrown nor pilfered by the boldness or ingenuity of any Diomed or Ulysses the fabric in which this eternal guardian is magnificently lodged must be impregnable and immortal  THE COLONEL  Alas my good friend how many of such impregnable fortresses in which not only morality but religion herself in all her purity seemed to promise their preservation have mouldered into dust It is possible I fear that your favourite serious Ramblers like many admirable sermons of past times may in a few centuries be utterly forgotten  THE ARCHDEACON  Surely not for although it is certain those excellent papers have all the serious purity of a sermon yet they have also very different attractions To me the Ramblers exhibit a mental paradise in which fancy and reason alternately entertain me with a succession of new delights under the guidance and patronage of virtue and religion While I read them I feel to use the words of their incomparable author  my heart rectified my appetites counteracted and my passions repressed  THE COLONEL  I most readily admit that the Ramblers from the evident design of the writer and from their intrinsic merit  in many points of view have very strong and I sincerely hope they may prove successful claims to immortality Yet as lessons on life and manners there are many productions of the same class whose influence on my heart and mind is not only more pleasant but more beneficial To read the Rambler is to my feelings to walk through a stupendous Egyptian temple of black marble furnished with some Colossal statues of ebony and with here and there a little grotesque image very lamely copied from ordinary life I perceive at every step a strength and grandeur of conception in the dark fancy of the melancholy architect I perceive also that in the course of his gloomy labour he had short fits of merriment and that in those sportive  moments he was singularly awkward and ungraceful In the whole structure there is an air of awful majesty that always fixes my attention and frequently enchants me yet at the end of my circuit through its various apartments I feel rather depressed and amazed than animated and improved Such is the effect which his most considerable work produces upon me and that many others have surveyed it with similar feelings we may conclude from what he tells us himself in the close of the last paper The book is in your hand give me leave to read the sentence  Scarcely any man is so steadily serious as not to complain that the severity of dictatorial instruction has been too seldom relieved and that he is driven by the sternness of the  Rambler's philosophy to more chearful and airy companions  THE ARCHDEACON  I admire the magnanimity of this confession  THE COLONEL  You are very generous my good friend in allowing that quality to a poor discontented author who tells us in a fit of honest spleen that he thought himself too wise for his readers  THE ARCHDEACON  It is surely true that the serious air and let me say the sublime beauties of that production were the chief obstacles to its immediate success Its merit was of too elevated a nature to be instantly  understood by the frivolous multitudebut it has at length been fairly appreciated by time and the great moralist is now universally read not only for the dignity of his sentiments but for the force and lustre of his language For my own part I exult in the growing influence of his genius I am happy in seeing it tend to the full discharge of that glorious office for which every great mind should think itself fashioned by Heaven I mean the office of diffusing the light of knowledge and of virtue over millions of spirits inferior to itself  THE COLONEL  I will not be so ungrateful as to say that I catch not any such rays from Johnson but if I am frequently enlightened  by his bursts of splendid sentiment I am still more frequently darkened and depressed by his thick vollies of spleen In all his writings and in the Rambler particularly he seems to me to bear a great resemblance to his own Suspirius the Screechowl whom he represents you know  as settled in an opinion that the whole business of life is to complain and whose every syllable was loaded with misfortune  He would indeed be the most meritorious of all moralists if the merit of a preceptor consisted in trying to teach mankind that their existence is misery I own myself devoted to more enlivening philosophy for I could never find that wisdom and virtue are acquired by catching the contagion of constitutional melancholy  or that the heart is made better in proportion as the imagination is terrified  THE ARCHDEACON  Yet a man of your thoughtful turn my dear Colonel must surely allow that in alluring men to pay a serious attention to their duty a writer takes the first and most necessary step towards making them better It is not the gloom of melancholy but the solemnity of religion that gives such a serious air to the compositions of Johnson and instead of blaming the philosopher I think you ought rather to applaud the Christian  THE COLONEL  I have already said that your Moralist appears to me to have mistaken the true  spirit of Christianity in his manners and I think so no less in the tenor of his works which without mentioning those that are envious and unjust have a general tendency to inspire a dreary gloominess of spirit A soldier perhaps my dear reverend friend may have formed very erroneous notions of sacred things which he cannot have studied sufficiently but to my apprehension the true spirit of our religion is more chearful than gloomy for in what does Christianity surpass all the religions of the earth not in its austerity not in its terror but in its benignity in its comfort It is chearful because it excites us to the most attentive discharge of those tender and social duties which cannot be duly discharged without gentleness and joy Other religions may  animate the frame by flattering some particular passion as the Alcoran for instance undoubtedly flatters the two passions of desire and ambition But Christianity in my idea of it accomplishes this end by the very opposite means it melts down all the passions and extracts from them the vivifying essence of universal charityForgive me for thus throwing out the rough conceptions of a laical enthusiast on so interesting a topic I am sure you will forgive me because I know we think alike both on the importance and the benignity of our religion  THE ARCHDEACON  And let me remind you my excellent friend that our ideas agree also with those of the great Author whom you are  too hastily condemning You seem to have utterly forgot that the Rambler contains not only as sublime but as chearful a picture of Christianity as the human faculties can exhibit pray recollect the dream in which a lovely figure exclaims  My name is Religion I am the offspring of Truth and Love and the parent of Benevolence Hope and Joy  It is remarkable that the speaker and his opponent seem equally unaware of a considerable mistake in this quotation The words indeed are in the Rambler but in number a paper supplied by a Lady who in copying the energy of Johnson's language has embellished his work with the purest religious sentiments  Note by the Editor    THE COLONEL  I perfectly recollect the allegory you mean for I happened to read it  aloud the other day to my sister and I remember on our finishing the paper we both regretted that Religion when she settled herself in the mind of Johnson seemed to have excluded these her three children from her household To religious joy he appears to have been almost a stranger he was not favoured with very long or very frequent visits from religious hope and that religious benevolence which we frequently admire as the immediate director of his pen was continually overpowered and struck dumb by the stronger voices of his more constant companions pride envy and spleen I allow you that few authors have written with a more religious cast of mind than your Moralist yet surely he disgusts his reader not by being too much but too little of a  Christian Religion has sometimes an effect similar to what is imputed to wine instead of giving new dispositions to the mind it strengthens and calls forth the humour it happens to meet whether good or bad thus the natural ferocity of Johnson is seen to mount in a religious blaze when in his ramble among the sacred ruins of Scotland his imagination delights itself in conceiving that a ruinous steeple may fall to crush the posterity of the Scottish Reformer Surely said a friend of ours when he first saw that anecdote of Johnson this man wanted only the lot of being born in Spain when the inquisition was established to have been distinguished as the most blackminded and bloody supporter of that barbarous tribunal  LADY CAROLINE  Enough my dear disputants on this point Pray allow me to give a new turn to your debate for I foresee that if you grow warm on this branch of your argument one of you will make him a saint and the other a fiend though it is very evident to our cool apprehension that he was neither but as most of you lordly creatures might be found perhaps in such mental dissection a very strange compound of both  THE COLONEL  Very well my dear Lady So you think the sons of Eve like the male heirs who seize the whole estate in our modern families have taken from their  sisters all the ample inheritance of imperfection Give me your hand my poor sister for if any son of Eve can be truly said to have done so I am the man  THE ARCHDEACON  So you are my friend as far as the Lady is concerned and let me add that you resemble the modern heir in another particular you have so contrived to get rid of this same ample inheritance that we cannot even guess the amount of it  LADY CAROLINE  I thank you doubly my good friend for answering one compliment for me and at the same time favouring me with anotherBut come we are idly  rambling from our subject You have still to consider Johnson both as a Poet and a Critic  THE COLONEL  In the first character he may be soon dispatched We have only to say what I think unquestionable that he was inferior to the whole body of English poets whom he has so ferociously anatomized  THE ARCHDEACON  I ask your pardon There is nothing finer in our language than his imitation of Juvenal and his various prologues particularly the very fine prologue that delineates the progress of the drama  THE COLONEL  Surely there is some degree of courtesy in allowing his name to stand on the list of poets for having written the most frigid and uninteresting tragedy that can be selected from all the languages of the earth and a forcible imitation of a declamatory Satirist He thought himself indeed a great poet and tried to bully the public into the same opinion by the close of the arrogant prologue to his Irene  In reason nature truth he dares to trust  Ye fops be silent and ye wits be just  This would have been bold language for any writer to have used in speaking of his most fortunate production but what is it when applied to a performance  which instead of being inspired by his boasted patrons Reason Nature and Truth appeared to be rather the work of false unfeeling art and of pompous absurdityHis critical bitterness may be partly ascribed to his great dramatic disappointment Having utterly failed in his prime ambition to distinguish himself and make his fortune as a poet he conceived an eternal hatred to the whole tribe of poets and unluckily for that tribe his powers of defaming poetical merit were as strong as his power to equal it was feeble And hence as I lately heard a censurer of his criticism altered a titlepage to his Lives of the Poets and called them  The Lives of the triumphant Angels written by Lucifer the fallen  Indeed  he seems to have dipt his pen not only in gall but  In everburning sulphur unconsum'd  In all his compositions and even in his recorded conversation when he is most virulent and ferocious there is still such vigour of intellect in what he says that I must own he hardly ever appears  Less than Archangel ruin'd  THE ARCHDEACON  I am glad you allow him some dignity as a writer however diabolicalBut my good friend are you not aware of the extreme inconsistency in your description You represent him as a most striking example both of feebleness and  vigour In one point you must be mistaken for it is impossible that the same being can be both a giant and a dwarf  THE COLONEL  Pardon methat impossibility was realized in Johnson He was a giant in some faculties and a dwarf in others  THE ARCHDEACON  Yet surely not a dwarf in that faculty which is said to constitute a poetI mean imaginationOne of his friends has told us you know and I think very truly  His mind was so full of imagery that he might have been perpetually a poet  THE COLONEL  We find he made the experiment and could never be so completelyHis latest biographer indeed seems aware of his poetical and his critical failure and appears to apologize for both by supposing that he is  to be numbered among those poets in whom the powers of understanding more than those of the imagination are seen to exist  But such a supposition affords us no very favourable or just estimate of the talents that really belonged to this wonderful being for even the enemies of Johnson must allow that a very vigorous and a very quick imagination was one of his most striking characteristics The truth I believe is however paradoxical it may sound that a writer may possess the  faculty of imagination in a high degree and yet prove himself a miserable poet Let any one try to read the Irene of Johnson and he will be perfectly convinced of this truth There are fine images elevated sentiments and splendid language yet the performance produces only languor and disgust because the author was utterly destitute of that sensibility which alone can enable a writer to awaken interest and pathos A poet who has not the smallest degree of dominion over the passions is as poor and impotent a being as a king without subjects  THE ARCHDEACON  Such an author may fail in the drama and yet excel in other branches of poetry  THE COLONEL  I do not believe there is an instance of any great poet upon record who was unable on every occasion to assume the easy air of nature and to speak the language of the heart Such inability I think attended Johnson both in verse and prose Yet with all that deficiency I feel he had faculties which justly make him an object of admiration He had a depth an expansion a majesty of intellecthe had an imagination that could present either grand or grotesque images to the mind with infinite clearness and forcehe could lead or bewilder the judgment by strength of argument or by logical subtlety he could amuse the fancy by such pageants as she is fond of  surveyingbut I question if any poet or essayist ever existed with less power of exciting either tears or laughter With a total inability to catch or support the proper tone of any assumed character he appears to me among writers very like what a deformed giant would be in a company of players who might indeed appear on the stage in the parts of Hamlet or Benedick but would certainly not charm you with any dramatic illusion while you discovered under his theatrical disguise the highshouldered Goliah An effect of this defective kind to use the quibble of Polonius strikes me perpetually in Rasselas I hardly ever hear a sentence uttered by the Princess or the Lady Pekuah but I see the enormous Johnson in petticoats  THE ARCHDEACON  Had Rasselas been the production of a Frenchman his country would have called it a noble poemAnd surely distinguished as it is by liveliness of description by dignity of sentiment by elevation and purity of language we ought to esteem it as the work of a poetical imagination  THE COLONEL  I have already declared my opinion that the imagination of Johnson was of the highest class It was indeed a diamond but like the rarity that I lately read an account of in that excellent physician and philosopher Dr Lewis it was a black diamond and malevolent melancholy was the  foulness  of the jewel to use the expression of the naturalist on which  its black hue depended  See Lewis's Philosophical Commerce of Arts p  You may tell me that we ought to treat this melancholy with tenderness because it was an hereditary misfortune in that point of view every person of common humanity must be inclined to pardon and to pity its effects But let not the quality which was an infirmity in the man be esteemed as a perfection in his works His Rasselas like the greater part of his other composition leaves a heavy and uncomfortable gloom upon the mind You will tell me perhaps that the author wished to produce a very serious effect and that it constitutes a part of  his superlative moral merit to have converted that idle or mischievous thing called a romance into a salutary bookIt may be soI can indeed conceive that the old proverb concerning meat and poison may be as true concerning books our intellectual food as it certainly is in regard to our ordinary diet There may be minds to whom the pompous and dark fictions of your Moralist are both salutary and pleasant To me they are neither for instead of quickening my virtues they only communicate their own gloominess to my spiritsHis imagination appears to me to resemble the Chinese bird celebrated in that literary curiosity  The Praise of Monkden by his poetical majesty of China  The bird is called Yuen Its melancholy  cry for it has no song is said to awaken the whirlwind and it flies only in the darkness of a tempestuous night  THE ARCHDEACON  Severely as you have treated Johnson both as a poet and a novelist there is yet one character in which you must allow him to stand superior to every antagonist He was not indeed the greatest poet or the most interesting novelist that ever wrote but as a critic he has no equal His Lives of the Poets though not free from little defects and inclining perhaps to an excess of severity in a few articles yet contain a mass of criticism superior perhaps to all the united critical labours of the ancient and modern world Different objections may be made to  different parts but all voices conspire in celebrating the whole as the rich production of the most profound and acute understanding that was ever employed in the illustration of any single art  THE COLONEL  If barbarity can entitle a judge to preside over his brethren you are undoubtedly right in considering Johnson as the prince of critics His criticism has to my apprehension all the excellencies and all the failings of his other composition It has all the powers that the head can give it has none of the charms that the heart only can supply If you examine his decisions on all our poets you will find that he ingeniously mingles as much malignity  with his justice as the nature of his office would allow him to exert  THE ARCHDEACON  This surely is a mistake You are angry with him for his sarcastic severity to a few of your favourites and therefore too hastily accuse him of malevolence and injustice towards the whole fraternity of poetsbut if his censure is now and then acrimonious his praise in general is candid generous and magnificentThe Lives taken altogether strike me as the most radiant crown of glory that poetic genius ever received from critical admiration  THE COLONEL  I believe I can point out to you some very dark flaws in the brilliants  you admire But first answer me one question Shall you not think the malevolence and I might add the absurdity of the critic sufficiently proved if in his characters of many poets I shew you passages where the censure is not only too vehement but infinitely more applicable to his own writings than to the poet whom he is censuring  THE ARCHDEACON  This I confess would abate my reverence for his judgment But I am persuaded you would not find it possible to collect such evidence as you describe  THE COLONEL  As it happens I have it ready to produce for being curious to convince  myself how far his malignity to our poets extended I amused myself the other day in selecting such passages as appeared to confirm my idea Here they arelet me read them to you in order and I think you will agree with me that they exhibit rather a strong resemblance of Johnson himself than a fair delineation of the unfavourable features in our great English bardsI begin with a passage from his character of Shakespeare  In tragedy his performance seems constantly to be worse as his labour is more Whenever he solicits his invention or strains his faculties the offspring of his throes is tumour meanness  tediousness and obscurity  In narration he affects a disproportionate  pomp of diction and a wearisome train of circumlocution and tells the incident imperfectly in many words which might have been more plainly delivered in fewNot that always where the language is intricate the thought is subtile or the image always great where the line is bulky the equality of words to things is very often neglected and trivial sentiments and vulgar ideas disappoint the attention to which they are recommended by sonorous epithets and swelling figures  He no sooner begins to move than he counteracts himself and terror and pity as they are rising in the mind are checked and blasted by sudden frigidity  Preface to Shakespeare    Well my good friend is not all this a thousand times more applicable to Johnson himself than to Shakespeare  THE ARCHDEACON  I must confess it appears so but in the Lives of the Poets you can hardly have found any words so treacherously fitted to your purpose or contrive to make them recoil so cruelly on their author  THE COLONEL  You shall hearand that I may not tire you I will omit many of the sentences in my listBut what say you to the following  The compositions are such as might have been written for pennance by a hermit or for hire by a  philosophical rhymer who had only heard of another sex  Life of Cowley    This indeed is partly true of Cowley's amorous poetry yet it strikes me as more exactly descriptive of Johnson's various attempts to delineate female characters  The malignity of your Critic towards Milton fell rather on the man than the poetand for this you know he has been very justly chastised There is a sanctity in the poetical character of Milton which secured it against any gross violation from a person who piqued himself on his piety yet in his account of this religious bard your Moralist has contrived to insert a few malevolent remarks infinitely more applicable to himself as an author than to the sublime  and tender poet whom he detestedLet me read you my evidence  Milton never learned the art of doing little things with grace he overlooked the milder excellence of suavity and softness he was a lion that had no skill in dandling the kid  We read Milton for instruction retire harrassed and overburthened and look elsewhere for recreation  How egregiously false are these words as said of the poet how completely true when applied to Johnson himselfThe milder half of Milton's merit this great critic had no feelings to perceive He could justly estimate the vigour of his imagination but he could not discover the tenderness of his heart which is exquisitely displayed in the character  of EveHow perfectly has our divine poet caught the true tone of female nature in those simple beautiful and pathetic lines with which our lovely parent closes a speech in the th book  Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe  So dear I love him that with him all deaths  I could endure without him live no life  How unfeeling must be the critic who could represent the author of such verses as utterly deficient  in suavity and softness  THE ARCHDEACON  His hatred and injustice to Milton which arose from his political sentiments has you know been confessed and lamented by his friendsAs a counterpoise  to this defect let me remind you of the noble justice which he has done to DrydenHis account of this extraordinary poet to whom Pope has so justly and so pathetically applied the epithet  unhappy  is executed as the painters say  con amore  and strikes me as the masterpiece of our critical biographer  THE COLONEL  It is easy to account for this preeminence for in his whole list of poets there is no individual to whom the biographer bore so great a resemblance in the general cast of his mind in his political and I believe in his religious notionsFrom some of Dryden's failings indeed the critic was happily free and to some of his talents he has no pretension  but that they resembled each other not a little in their mental features you will clearly discover by observing how exactly the following passages from his forcible and just character of Dryden are descriptive of himself  The power that predominated in his intellectual operations was rather strong reason than quick sensibility Upon all occasions that were presented he studied rather than felt and produced sentiments not such as nature enforces but meditation supplies He had so little sensibility of the power of effusions purely natural that he did not esteem them in others Simplicity gave him no pleasurehe could more easily fill the ear with some splendid novelty than awaken  those ideas that slumber in the heart  Life of Dryden    THE ARCHDEACON  These passages are indeed applicable to Johnson and so doubtless are many sentences of praise that we might discover in his Biography one honourable metaphor at least let us apply to him out of the life from which you are quoting and alluding to the close of his admirable eulogy on Dryden "Let us say of him that he found the English language a confused heap of loose stones and that he left them raised by his single labour into a noble edifice which amazes us by its magnificence and delights us by its utility"  LADY CAROLINE  I thank you my good friend for throwing in a little just commendation to temper the Colonel's severityHe seems I think to be engaged in a cruel kind of a process it is like the forcing a poor soldier to stand before the mouth of his own great gun and reluctantly blow himself to pieces  THE COLONEL  By no means If an engineer in levelling a cannon against those whom he ought to have spared manages it so ill as to hurt only himself by its recoil the fault is doubly his own and however maimed he may be he cannot be much entitled to compassionNow I think Johnson exactly in this predicament  and when you hear the following extracts I trust you will agree with me For brevity's sake I will confine myself to the lives of Prior Hammond Collins and Gray omitting several sentences in my collection  To make you an immediate convert my dear Lady to the justice of my procedure I shall begin with the character of your beloved Henry and Emma  A dull and tedious dialogue which excites neither esteem for the man nor tenderness for the woman  Every heart murmurs at the injustice of these words thus pointed against Priorbut observe with what propriety we might write them dropping only two particles on the titlepage of Irene and call that Tragical Homily  dull and tedious dialogue which excites neither  esteem for man nor tenderness for woman  But hear the fuller estimate of Prior's talents  As laws operate in civil agency not to the excitement of virtue but the repression of wickedness so judgment in the operations of intellect can hinder faults but not produce excellenceWhatever Prior obtains above mediocrity seems the effort of struggle and of toil he has many vigorous but few happy lines he has every thing by purchase and nothing by gift he had no nightly visitations of the Muse no infusions of sentiment or felicities of fancy  His expression has every mark of laborious study the line seldom seems to have been formed at once the  words did not come till they were called and were then put by constraint into their places where they do their duty but do it sullenlyIn his greater compositions there may be found more rigid stateliness than graceful dignity His numbers are such as mere diligence may attain they seldom offend the ear and seldom sooth it they commonly want airiness lightness and facility what is smooth is not soft His verses always roll but they seldom flow  Prior's life    There's a curious portrait for you If we knew not the painter might we not suppose that it was rather drawn for the stiff and pompous Johnson himself than for the easy elegant and sportive Prior  As to Hammond Johnson seems to have criticised him with the utmost rancour because he had been justly praised by Chesterfield whom the splenetic savage seizes this opportunity to calumniate by representing him as commending the Elegies of his departed friend without having read thema charge not only absurd in itself but inconsistent with the idea which this rancorous critic entertained of the noble editor's vanity since the Earl is elegantly and justly complimented in the very poems which he is supposed to have praised without knowing their contentsI shall hope to convince you in the course of our conference that Chesterfield was as good a judge of nature in poetry as Johnson and that he had the talent of representing it more faithfully as an essayist  than your great Moralist himselfBut let me now read the censure on Hammond  These Elegies have neither passion nature nor mannersAgain Hammond has few sentiments drawn from nature and few images from modern life He produces nothing but frigid pedantry  Life of Hammond    Do you not admire this charge of pedantry against a poet remarkable for the easy elegance of his language from another who talks himself of  Arthritic Tyranny  in an ode to the Spring  But to shew you the difference between Hammond and Johnson as poets  let me read you these two short extracts from each  What joy to hear the tempest howl in vain  And clasp a fearful mistress to my breast  Or lull'd to slumber by the beating rain  Secure and happy sink at last to rest  What joy to wind along the cool retreat  To stop and gaze on Delia as I go  To mingle sweet discourse with kisses sweet  And teach my lovely scholar all I know  Every man who has loved must perceive that in these verses though I have injured them by placing them together the passion of love is expressed with delicacy spirit and truth Now hear how Johnson closes one of those curious compositions that he calls Odes  Haste press the clusters fill the bowl  Apollo shoot thy parting ray  This gives the sunshine of the soul  This God of Health and Verse and Day  Still still the jocund strain shall flow  The pulse with vigorous rapture beat  My Stella with new charms shall glow  And every bliss in wine shall meet  Johnson's Autumn an Ode    To say  Press the clusters  is an odd mode of calling for wineBut I quote the passage to shew the tenderness of the poet to his Stella Put the sentiment into plain prose and it runs thusCome let us get half drunk my dear Stella and I shall  then think you beautiful  and  myself happy  LADY CAROLINE  This is playing the barbarous critical tyrant indeed You outHerod HerodBut pray proceed to your extract from the Life of Collins which I do not perfectly recollect I only remember that the critic mentions his personal intimacy with the poet and I should therefore imagine he must speak of his interesting compositions with an affectionate enthusiasm sufficient to defeat your hostile purpose of turning the heavy fire of his critical battery against himself  THE COLONEL  Oh your great Critic had too elevated and too stately a mind to be touched by the partialities of friendship Hear  how he closes a character of the poet written when we might suppose his tenderness to be quickened by the recent death of his friend  This idea which he had formed of excellence led him to oriental fictions and allegorical imagery and perhaps while he was intent upon description he did not sufficiently cultivate sentiment His poems are the productions of a mind not deficient in fire nor unfurnished with knowledge either of books or life but somewhat obstructed in its progress by deviation in quest of mistaken beauties  Life of Collins    No one I believe can think the Critic spoke too kindly of Collins in this early characteryet as if his judgment had been warped  by affection in the subsequent life which was not written you know till an interval of many years had allowed time enough for his  extreme  tenderness to evaporate he added the following censure on the language of his poetical friend  His diction was often harsh unskilfully laboured and injudiciously selected He affected the obsolete when it was not worthy of revival and he puts his words out of the common order seeming to think with some later candidates for fame that not to write prose is certainly to write poetry His lines commonly are of slow motion clogged and impeded with clusters of consonants As men are often esteemed who cannot be loved so the poetry of Collins may  sometimes extort praise when it gives little pleasure  Life of Collins    Now to my apprehension every syllable in both these Extracts is infinitely more suited to Johnson than to his injured friend the greater part of whose poetry as Langhorne has justly said of his ode on the death of Colonel Ross  is replete with harmony spirit and pathos  But I hasten to the last article on my listthe insulted Gray You are both of you so well acquainted with the Critic's extreme iniquity towards this enchanting bard that I will only read a single short passage from those I have selected  The images are magnified by affectation the language is laboured into harshness The mind of the writer  seems to work with unnatural violence  double double toil and trouble  He has a kind of strutting dignity and is tall by walking on tiptoe His art and his struggle are too visible and there is too little appearance of ease or nature  Life of Gray    Tell me I beseech you to whose writings may we most properly apply this exaggerated description to those of Gray or of Johnson To me it appears to hit the tumid Rambler himself so forcibly that if any man were to attempt a small but strong caricatura of Johnson as an author I question if he could produce one with so striking a resemblance as this very paragraph exhibits  And now my good friend ingenuously say have I not convinced you that Johnson in passing sentence on our great poets instead of fairly representing their petty failings has frequently delineated his own heavier defects and ascribed them to spirits of a higher class to whom they could not belong  THE ARCHDEACON  You have I must own convinced me that he was frequently unjust but I am still inclined to impute that injustice rather to the keenness and strength than to the malignity of his mind I am persuaded he always spoke as he felt but he felt blemishes too forcibly from the rigid integrity of his acute understanding Whenever he blames I believe you may discover  some little foundation for his censure but he builds perhaps too large a structure on too trifling a basis I cannot better explain to you my idea on this point than by applying to him a lively couplet of Dr Young  His judgment just his sentence over strong  Because he's right he's ever in the wrong  THE COLONEL  Very wellif you acknowledge him to be in the wrong I will allow you to estimate as you please the moral rectitude of his perceptions My own idea of him as a critic is thisHis illnature or if you wish for a softer expression his spleen had I think a microscopic eye which whenever it happened to glance on a  freckle in the face of any luckless muse immediately made it a cancer  THE ARCHDEACON  If as a critic he was too severe his severity may still produce a very useful effect on the trifling vagrants of Parnassus by exciting them to think with more energy And let me add he has one critical merit which deserves the highest commendation I mean the merit of having rescued the dramatic muse from those oppressive and threefold fetters  The Unities  The demolition of a perplexing poetical superstition which had been sanctified by the reverence of ages was the work of a noble understanding very worthily employed and a work that  ought to endear his name to every lover of the stage  THE COLONEL  I heartily join with you in this applause though in general I have little veneration for your Philosopher in his critical capacity It is Sir Henry Wotton I think who has called critics the brushers of noblemen's clothes and if his metaphor is just we may say that Johnson like a heavyhanded valet has executed this office with such vehemence as fretted to pieces the fine raiment of his masters  THE ARCHDEACON  Indeed you are too severeBut how great soever you may represent the mistakes of Johnson in points that belong  solely to taste and sentiment on which perhaps we could hardly find any two minds in perfect unison the great and solid portion of his merit must still remain entire He strikes me like a venerable oak which though it may discover a few blighted leaves and a little dead wood perhaps in the extremity of its branches has a noble sound trunk of the most valuable texture The world surely owes no little respect to a writer who not only laboured for many years with great sincerity and fervour to improve their morals but exerted his rare faculties for that purpose with such constant rectitude of mind with such uncommon chastity of thought and expression that I question if his numerous works contain a single word or allusion which  the most modest female would blush to read in the presence of a parent or a lover  THE COLONEL  Then you must think our fair president here a very squeamish lady my good friend for she told us you know that she was often disgusted both by Chesterfield and Johnson  THE ARCHDEACON  You are a very treacherous antagonist in attempting to injure me so barbarously in the opinion of our judgeBut the equity of Lady Caroline is not to be corrupted or misled She will clearly perceive that you draw a very unwarrantable inference from what I advanced Indelicacy is not the only  offence in a writer by which a lady can be disgusted As far as Lord Chesterfield is concerned I can indeed believe that this offence was alluded to for your dainty refiner of our manners abounds I think in such indelicate images as are most likely to disgust a mind so pure as that in question But whenever Lady Caroline was disgusted by Johnson it was I am convinced by a defect very different from indelicacy yet a defect of which she is equally qualified to judgeI mean his critical injustice  THE COLONEL  She is not sufficiently honest or I should rather say she is too delicate herself to confess and demonstrate to you the contrary but I will on this  occasion be her interpreterThere is undoubtedly a great degree of such purity as you have justly praised in the writings of Johnson yet immaculate as you think him I can shew you a sentence in his biography which is perhaps both the most cruel and the most indecent sentence that ever fell from the pen of a serious writer and I am persuaded this very passage was in my sister's thoughts when she made use of the word  disgusted  THE ARCHDEACON  You have awakened my curiosity Pray indulge me with an explanation of what you allude to for I cannot even guess at the passage  THE COLONEL  Here it is in the volume that lies open before usIt relates to the unfortunate lady so pathetically lamented by Popeyou remember her history I will only read the biographer's observation upon it  From this account given with evident intention to raise the lady's character it does not appear that she had any claim to praise nor much to compassion She seems to have been impatient violent and ungovernable her uncle's power could not have lasted long the hour of liberty and choice would have come in time But her desires were too hot for delay and she  liked selfmurder better than suspense  What say you my good friend to the close of this paragraphI doubt it the pen of Aretine himself ever delineated the rage of incontinence with grosser or more disgusting energyThere is a savage barbarity to my feelings in this passage that I want words to express It brings to my fancy the image of a cannibal who in finding the corse of an unhappy selfslaughtered girl instead of breathing over it a natural sigh of compassion tears the hapless body to pieces with a ferocious sarcastic insult on the poor unfortunate being who in a fit of distraction had made herself his prey Your great Moralist is the more inexcusable  in this case because the unfortunate Lady instead of being so outrageously eager to gratify her desires appears I think to have been a tender penitent not immured in a convent by the tyranny of a relation but a voluntary recluse who wished perhaps but found herself unable to atone for past frailties by a long perseverance in solitude and prayer  THE ARCHDEACON  The late accounts that we have all read of this unfortunate Lady are very far from agreeing with your description  THE COLONEL  I know it but I put no trust in the petty tales which are so confidently recorded  by the chroniclers of every idle hearsay I cannot indeed perfectly vouch for the truth of my description but I can shew you it has the colouring of probability You may recollect Pope himself tells us in a note to his pathetic elegy that the Lady was the same person to whom the Duke of Buckingham had addressed a copy of verses on her design of retiring into a monastery I will endeavour to repeat to you a few lines of the Duke's poetry and luckily for his Grace's poetical credit and my recollection the lines I am trying to remember are the best in the poemO I have just recovered enough for my argumentThe Duke describes a tender enchanting mistress on the point of tearing herself from the arms of her  happy lover in a sudden gust of devotion and proceeds thus  "And after all our vows our sighs our "tears  "My banish'd sorrows and your conquer'd "fears  "So many doubts so many dangers past  "Visions of zeal must vanquish me at last"  Such are the grounds on which I represented this hapless fair as a distracted penitent instead of an outrageous wanton and if you consider the force of the passionate verses I have quoted you will surely allow that my conjecture is more specious at least than the improbable story that she was in love with Pope At all events the Biographer  has treated her barbarouslyI have heard that he was intreated to cancel the passage while the proof sheets were before him on account of its indecency and its injustice but that he persisted in his savage resolve to stigmatize the unfortunate Lady that he might not lose an opportunity of shewing how truly he abhorred the crime of suicide to the verge of which his own melancholy I believe had often conducted him  THE ARCHDEACON  I thank you heartily for this anecdote I never heard any thing in my life I never read any thing of this nervous this sublime author that impressed me with so forcible so grand an idea of his magnanimous morality I now see Johnson in all his glory determined to  exert his rare faculties for the real good of his fellowcreatures with a noble a divine indifference to their applause and their abuse  THE COLONEL  What can you burst into a rapturous panegyric on his brutality  THE ARCHDEACON  Brutality my good friend Let us give a juster name to qualities that do honour to mankind I grant you every thing you can wish as to the severe and gross appearance of the passage you condemn I will allow you it is a sentence at which the cheek of a truly virtuous woman may turn crimson not only from wounded modesty but from an honest womanly indignation in beholding so  hideous a caricatura of female tenderness But all these tremendous objections against it tend only to encrease my reverence for the writer and why because I clearly perceive all the generous ideas that led him to write and to persevere in maintaining the passageLet us only examine the thoughts that must have passed in his mind on that occasion He must have thought in this manner "I have written a sentence that is said to violate the elaborate purity of my moral compositions a sentence over which envy and malevolence will exult and at which decency herself may be disgustedbut I know by what insidious steps the demon of melancholy may lead a poor idle girl whose affections perhaps are wisely thwarted to the  precipice of suicideIf her piety will not save her yet her pride may be rendered the instrument of her preservationI may resemble the ancient legislators who to stop the contagious passion for this crime among the women of their city exposed the naked body of the selfmurdered female The sentence objected to may check some unhappy woman on the verge of suicide by shewing her how gross an interpretation the crime she meditates may receiveLet the delicacy of millions be offended if I can save but the life of oneWhat are censure and applause to a writer when put in the scale against such a possibilitymy heart tells me they are dust in the balance"  So he reasoned so he acted and we  ought to revere the heroical benevolence and dignity of his decision  THE COLONEL  Nobly argued my good friendI read in the countenance of the Lady that in this article you have made converts of us bothBut I am astonished to find by the progress of the sun how our morning has slipt awayit grieves me to break up the conference but I have some necessary letters to dispatch by the post of today  LADY CAROLINE  What are you really going brother and do you mean to abandon the defence of your favourite Chesterfield  THE ARCHDEACON  Madam the Colonel is aware that on many occasions and I believe in the present a masterly retreat may be more honourable than a victory  THE COLONEL  Do not say soyou shall not find it so  LADY CAROLINE  Well then let me make one request to you boththat we may not say a syllable more either on Chesterfield or Johnson till we are quietly settled again in this room tomorrow  THE COLONEL  I am much obliged to you for the idea for in truth I should appear a miserable advocate for the accomplished Earl whose memory I am to vindicate if I had not a little time allowed me to bring his cruelly mangled character to your compassionate contemplationThis I trust I shall be able to do tomorrow  Then will I speak right on  I'll tell you that which you yourselves do know  Shew you sweet Stanhope's wounds poor poor dumb mouths  And bid them speak for me but were I Brutus  And Brutus Antony there were an Antony  Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue  In every wound of Stanhope that should move  The books around us here to rise and speak  DIALOGUE II  LADY CAROLINE  WELL my dear advocate for the noble delinquent whom we are bringing to the bar I may presume you are fully prepared to answer the heavy charges against him since you seem to have got a collection of memorandums as copious as a lawyer's brief  THE COLONEL  Pray do not discountenance by your cruel raillery a poor unpractised pleader whose apparatus is only in proportion  to his want of talents and experience  LADY CAROLINE  I am glad to find that you enter with so much modesty on an office so daring as the defence of licentiousness for the good Archdeacon and I have been in some fear lest your quick imagination should inflame itself into a dangerous partiality to a character that your judgment cannot esteemHe justly observes that too warm an apology for vice may imperceptibly injure an honest mind by diminishing its due reverence for virtue and he has just pointed out to me an excellent paragraph in his favourite Rambler which tells us how culpable they are who have  used the light imparted from heaven only to  embellish folly and shed lustre upon crimes  THE COLONEL  You are good creatures to be so kindly solicitous for the preservation of that little rectitude of mind which has fallen to my lot But I trust your generous apprehension will subside when you recollect the nature of the points that I have undertaken to maintainI have by no means engaged to exalt my Lord Chesterfield into a model of moral excellence but I ventured to say yesterday what I am now still more inclined and I flatter myself more able to supportthat with splendid and engaing talents he had neither more nor worse vices than your pompous Philosopher and that he is equally entitled  to the kind remembrance of his country This I think is an innocent and just assertion that to every unprejudiced mind may be rendered as evident as it is that to govern an unquiet kingdom as a temporary viceroy with dignity and to be uncommonly clear in that great office requires as much ability and as much virtue as are requisite to write a tumid moral essay or to compile an elaborate treasury of words  THE ARCHDEACON  I might reply to your sarcastic mode of entering on this comparison by an allusion to the compliment paid to Titian by the Emperor Charles the Vth I might tell you that the King can make many Lord Lieutenants but not a single Johnson  THE COLONEL  I believe the creative influence of regal power could much sooner make a Johnson than a Chesterfield The command of a prince can indeed produce elaborate language and ambitious morality but genuine wit and sportive urbanity are so far from being  creatible  if I may create a word by the will of a monarch that they very rarely condescend to appear in his presence Perhaps they never appeared at court to so much advantage as in the character of Chesterfield I question if they were ever united to more political integrity and how happily they may sometimes accomplish the irksome business of graver argument we have a pleasant instance in the anecdote of the noble  Lord's prevailing on the king to fill up a commission with a name which he had rejected with detestation It was in when the Earl was Secretary of State "I had rather have the Devil" said the angry sovereign when pressed to confirm the appointment in question "With all my heart" said the lively secretary who was waiting ready to fill up the instrument for the royal signature "I only beg leave to remind your majesty that the commission is indited to our right trusty and right wellbeloved cousin" The king you know laughed and complied with the wishes of his minister  THE ARCHDEACON  Your story is a good example of pleasantry welltimed I will not say what  I know many people think that a few lucky strokes of confident vivacity induced the world to deem much higher of his Lordship's wit than it really deserved but giving him full credit as a true proprietor of this graceful feather I must not allow you to consider it as equivalent to the more solid treasures of Johnson's moral wisdom and virtue  THE COLONEL  Nor can I permit you my dear and respected opponent to assume as incontestible an opinion which some honest people indeed have assumed too hastilythat Johnson was a compound of every thing that is morally good and Chesterfield of every thing that is morally evilIf I can shew  you that the accomplished Earl had in truth as much wisdom and virtue as the arrogant Philosopher with his own rich inheritance of native wit into the bargain you must certainly allow him to be the more admirable character of the two That he was indeed neither less wise nor less virtuous than Johnson is sufficiently evident to me from a little survey that I have taken of what I may call the morning and the evening in the lives of eachLet me set the two men before you for an instant in those striking periods of their existence At the age of thirty a season when the first whirlwind of the passions has subsided and the mind of man begins to assume a settled temperature how do we find Johnson employed Why truly in writing a rebellious  pamphlet which his very biographer represents as mean in its execution and detestable in its designNow let me direct your eyes to Chesterfield at the same ageWhat was the noble Lord doing at thirty In this year of his life I find him giving an early example of that generous integrity which he maintained through every stage of his political careerand politely rejecting the advice of those who recommended it to him to increase the profits of a post that he had just accepted by selling the subordinate places in his disposal You may tell me perhaps that such an early comparison of the two men in a point of political purity considering the difference of their birth and station is neither candid nor just Let us look then at the two veterans when  each was turned of seventy when both were preparing to quit the stage of life the Philosopher weary of having instructed the world and the Wit of having enlivened it At such a season if the Philosopher had indeed been a man of sound wisdom and virtue we might expect to find him calmly and chearfully looking forward to an immortal reward for the benefits which his labour had bestowed upon mankind and if the gayer life of the Wit had in truth been a mere tissue of vice and folly we might expect also to behold him at this important season sinking under the dread of a tremendous retribution Now are these the respective conditions in which we may actually contemplate these two opposite but illustrious old men No it is just the  reverse We see the imperious Philosopher looking back with remorse looking forward with consternation and strangely converting a justice of peace into a confessor to tell him  more secret transgressions than he was willing to hear  Now take a view of the superannuated Wit so unjustly suspected of a settled depravity in heart and spirit We find him and I beg you will observe the contrast soothing the ills of departing life and particularly that most depressive affliction his long and incurable deafness by pouring out all his manly and natural feelings in letters of the most tender friendship to a venerable prelatea prelate who was long his bosomfriend whom he had raised in a generous manner that did himself singular honour to episcopal dignity and  who to his own credit and to that of his noble patron was distinguished by the glorious appellation of the Good BishopIt was thus that Johnson and Chesterfield first appeared on our clamorous theatre of the world and it was thus they quitted it They are now gone to their great audit before the Judge of every heart who alone perhaps can truly decide which was indeed the man of most wisdom and virtue As far as their own books and the printed accounts of both can enable my limited faculties to form a just estimate of the two characters I declare and I entreat you not to condemn me too hastily for my declaration that were I acting under Heaven as a judge to decide the merits of the two  I should rather give the palm of virtue to Chesterfield than to Johnson  LADY CAROLINE  Our good friend I perceive is amazed and shocked by the singularity and confidence of your opinionand even I who know you better must confess myself a little surprized at your carrying your partiality so farI thought you would have contented yourself with an  as wise  and  as good  a kind of handinhand comparison as Shakespeare says but your bestowing the palm of Goodness on a character universally condemned for immorality is a stroke of whimsical enthusiasm that I did not expectLet me remind you however that we are departing from the plan we proposed to ourselves in this amicable  debate Pray recollect that the Archdeacon is first to state all the flagrant and numerous defects in your too engaging favourite and then you are to conclude not with his apology I find but his panegyric  THE ARCHDEACON  As the Colonel discovers so much zeal in the cause I beg that we may allow him to conduct the defence he has undertaken in any mode that he chuses You and I my dear Lady are at a time of life to be amused instead of corrupted by the magic of delusive eloquence however subtle it may be and for my own part I am highly entertained in observing with what acute ingenuity a very upright and religious mind when under the  influence of affectionate prejudice can decorate a favourite though faulty character Our honest enthusiast has undoubtedly deceived himself and he has I am persuaded sufficient talents to communicate that deception to others during the moment when he is speaking Yet were he speaking to the world at large on this topic I should be under no apprehension of his reversing the just decree of the public on the two characters in question and for this short and simple reasonThe public however dazzled by my oratorical friend would soon recollect the infallible test it possesses to decide the real merits of both and wisely say to itself By their works we may know themThe Philosopher however tainted by personal defects has  bequeathed to us an invaluable legacy of the sublimest moral instruction and the Wit however decorated by personal dignities has left us little more than an elegant manual of profligate advice so improperly addressed by a parent to his child that it has justly excited a general murmur of abhorrence  THE COLONEL  Surely my good friend you are speaking only to try my temper You cannot I am confident you cannot have seriously adopted the cruel absurdity of the world concerning the letters you allude to O that I possessed indeed that divine talent of eloquence which your laughingly ascribe to me and for which I am so little fashioned by nature or education Were I really master of  that enchanting power I hardly know a subject on which I should more delight to employ it than in doing justice to a man who deserved so highly of this nation and whose character has been so basely degradedWe talk of the frequent cruelty and injustice of Athens to the virtue that defended her walls and to the talents that immortalized her glory but I question if ever any meritorious Athenian ever experienced such posthumous ingratitude if I may use such an expression from his capricious fellowcitizens as Chesterfield has received from us Let me remind you that he was justly esteemed for half a century as one of the most accomplished characters in this kingdom He served his country as an ambassador in Holland and made the purest characters of that  republic his friends He served his country as a governor of Ireland at a period of great difficulty and danger and his virtues appeared to expand with his power He served his country as a minister at home and nobly quitted his place the moment he found it inconsistent with his integrity and honour He resigned not to indulge himself in factious turbulence but in literary retirement Study and conversation were indeed among his favourite amusements at every season of life for the native cast of his character was rather gentle than vehement and he opposed his enemies rather with gaiety than rancour In the course of a busy and splendid life he found time to write a few periodical lessons on life and manners in which he equalled the first authors  in that branch of literature and having sufficiently proved his taste by his own admirable productions he was universally regarded as the most accomplished patron of letters His manners and his wit were so engaging that he was long esteemed the chief ornament and delight of society and the eminent characters of every country in Europe appeared ambitious of his acquaintance and regard His latter days were embittered with many bodily infirmities which he supported however with a chearful and religious philosophy in considering this life as a fugitive dream that he did not wish to renew and in thinking of his Creator as he tells his bosomfriend the good Bishop of Waterford with more hope than fearSo lived and so died the Earl of Chesterfield  respected by the world and idolized by his friendsBut a Lady who had great reason to think well of the noble Lord seized the opportunity of his decease to publish a collection of letters written for a very private and very particular purpose She knew that they had been dictated by the parental tenderness of a good heart and she did not foresee that the public could ingeniously misinterpret them so far as to call them the suggestions of an evil spirit but as there is a constant eagerness in mankind to seize even the slightest opportunity of degrading an exalted name as soon as these letters were published an outcry was raised against them by many hypocritical pretenders to goodness and by many truly good people who wanted either faculties or  patience to form a fair estimate of their author Malevolent ridicule scattered her gibes on the father so solicitously striving to improve the awkward person of his child and mistaken piety represented him as a prodigy of wickedness labouring to infuse all his own follies and vices into his offspring and to establish a corrupt system of education that would annihilate all the virtue of our country But after all what is this masterpiece of profligacy when examined by truth and candour It is a singular and in many points the most admirable monument of paternal tenderness and anxiety that the literature of any nation can exhibit it is a work that instead of corrupting our sons may rather stimulate their parents to a quicker sense of their duty by shewing us that  a man in all the tumultuous bustle of busy of gay and of splendid life could find time to labour with incessant attention in trying to counteract the peculiar personal imperfections of a dear though awkward sonO Chesterfield I have read thee with the eyes of a father anxious not only for the temporal but the eternal interest of his children and my heart tells me that in the sight of our great allseeing Parent the work for which thou art vilified on earth must have more of merit than of sin  THE ARCHDEACON  Though every thing may be hoped from the mercy of the Supreme Judge I cannot see how the common justice of mankind can absolve a parent who even instigates his son to indulge himself in  crimes that are eminently pernicious to the peace and happiness of the world  THE COLONEL  Is it candid▪ is it just or I should rather say is it not the height of iniquitous cruelty to give so dark an interpretation to idle raillery in a familiar letter which like the jests of private conversation should be considered only as the idle pleasantry of the momentTo defend licentiousness by saying it was recommended only in a country whose customs appeared to give it a sanction is an argument which though it may extenuate the offence is far from being according to my ideas the best vindicacation that we may urge for the noble LordAll the immoral advice of Chesterfield may be compared to a drug  which though it is rank poison if swallowed indiscriminately by the multitude may operate as an innocent and useful medicine to a particular patientThe disease of young Stanhope to pursue the metaphor was awkwardness in the extreme and gallantry was the prescription of Chesterfield By giving his son credit in these private letters for more influence over the fair than he was formed to attain the father might mean no more than to lead him frequently into such female society as had the best chance of rendering him less an object of ridicule Immorality of this kind we hear every day in the sportive sallies of conversation between parents and children where no real act of licentiousness is intended and where no censure falls on the jesting preacher of very similar  doctrineIt is particularly cruel to give the darkest interpretation to the licentious levity of these motley letters when the same correspondence affords us many serious passages of the purest moralityThere is a double injustice in the common censure on these admirable lettersthey are condemned as a general system when they were expressly designed to correct the particular blemishes of an individualthey are condemned for not speaking more of morality and religion when the author informs us he had intentionally left those points to a worthy delegate Yet that he touched upon them sometimes and did it with all the affecting energy of a father truly anxious for the moral excellence of his son I hope to convince  you by reading the few following extracts  Pray observe with what honest and serious warmth this supposed advocate for vice exhorts his young disciple to the most scrupulous integrity  Your moral character must be not only pure but like Caesar's wife unsuspected The least speck or blemish upon it is fatal Nothing degrades and vilifies more for it excites and unites detestation and contempt There are however wretches in the world profligate enough to explode all notions of moral good and evil to maintain that they are merely local and depend entirely upon the customs and fashions of different countries nay there are still if possible  more unaccountable wretches I mean those who affect to preach and propagate such absurd and infamous notions without believing them themselves These are the devil's hypocrites Avoid as much as possible the company of such people who reflect a degree of discredit and infamy upon all who converse with them But as you may sometimes by accident fall into such company take great care that no complaisance no goodhumour no warmth of festal mirth ever make you seem even to acquiesce much less to approve or applaud such infamous doctrines  Chesterfield's Letters to his Son Letter    Can the most rigid moralist that ever existed surpass the rectitude and the  fervency of these admonitionsnot delivered indeed with the bloated affectation of pompous and pointed sentences but breathing the tenderness and the warmth of a pure parental spirit  The Ladies in their laudable zeal for the honour of their sex are angry with Chesterfield for representing them as unable to keep a secret but they forget the great object he had in view it was to form a minister for foreign courts and his caution therefore on this article was only guarding his son against those insinuating enemies to which an Ambassador is particularly exposed  The noble Author is accused of preferring  manners  to  morals  I intreat you to hear how justly he maintains in the following passage the preeminence of the latter  Good manners are to particular societies what good morals are to society in general their cement and their securityand as laws are enacted to enforce good morals or at least to prevent the ill effects of bad ones so there are certain rules of civility universally implied and received to enforce good manners and punish bad ones and indeed there seems to me to be less difference both between the crimes and the punishments than at first one would imagine The immoral man who invades another man's property is justly hanged for it and the illbred man who by his ill manners invades and disturbs the quiet and comforts of private life is by common consent as justly banished society Mutual complaisances attentions  and sacrifices of little conveniences are as natural an implied compact between civilized people as protection and obedience are between kings and subjects whoever in either case violates that compact justly forfeits all advantages arising from it For my own part I really think that  next  to the consciousness of doing  a good action  that of doing a civil one is the most pleasing and the epithet which I should covet the most  next to that of Aristides  would be that of wellbred  Letter    Again in the close of the same letter  Be convinced that goodbreeding is to all worldly qualifications what charity is to all Christian virtues  Can any preceptor my good friend  exhibit sounder sentiments than these either as to exterior accomplishment or internal perfection  THE ARCHDEACON  Like a skilful advocate you have shewn us the fair side of your client but had his book been entirely of this complexion its purity had never been impeached I believe we might oppose to your quotations innumerable passages of an opposite tendency But as I must confess I have not looked into this manual of politeness for several years I shall not attempt to enforce my general charge against it especially as you have answered that charge by a palliating argument which though it would hardly support any severe scrutiny is I am persuaded so sufficiently conclusive to  your partial goodnature that I should despair of converting you  LADY CAROLINE  You seem perfectly aware of my brother's foible which is a generous propensity to think every writer virtuous who displays the particular talents that afford him the highest pleasure You might have found him the other day as warmly engaged in defending the moral character of Sterne  THE COLONEL  Pardon me I only said that if Sterne was in truth the sorry character which many austere people affect to call him I supposed he was prompted to write by his good genius that in the register of the recording angel the merits of the  author might counterbalance all the sins of the man  THE ARCHDEACON  Yet you know that many human inquisitors have rather classed his writings in the catalogue of his transgressions  THE COLONEL  Yes and I am perfectly aware that your splenetic Moralist was one of those inquisitors But I can never subscribe to the severe sentence of a judge when every fibre in my head and heart assure me of his iniquityThere are glaring defects in the compositions of Sterne but the general effect of them is meritorious in the highest degree All the elaborate all the ostentatiously moral volumes of Johnson can never impress  on my mind such fervent sentiments of reverential gratitude to Heaven or of goodwill to earth as I receive from a few pages of the incomparable SternePerhaps no author ever possessed in so high a degree the inestimable talent of putting the untuned spirit into harmony with itself and with all around it If I take him up in a restless or gloomy fit he not only chaces from my mind every vestige of spleen but leaves in its place a disposition to chearful piety and active benevolence  LADY CAROLINE  You have utterly forgot my dear rambling enthusiast the noble Lord whose real or imaginary perfections you were to state to us though I fancy from the appearance of the paper in your  hand you have many more remarks to communicate for the illustration of his character  THE COLONEL  Thanks sweet remembrancer Let me look at my references for a moment and I will proceed in due order We proposed to compare Chesterfield and Johnson in three different lights first as men or citizens secondly as periodical lecturers on life and manners and lastly as writers in point of styleSince I find the Archdeacon is too candid in his own sentiments or too indulgent to my opinion of the party I am defending to dwell with great vehemence on the charge against my client I shall conclude my desultory pleading by a few brief observations arranged under  the three heads I have mentioned requesting my worthy friend to correct me where I am grossly mistaken and I shall then entreat your Ladyship to favour us with your frank and genuine sentiments on the two characters in question  I shall begin with pointing out to you a very striking difference between Chesterfield and Johnson in an article which I consider as a great test of an amiable heart I mean Friendship From the letters of the noble Lord to the Bishop of Waterford and Mr Dayrolles it is evident that he took the most lively interest in all the concerns of those two valuable menIndebted as they both were to his patronage and inferior to him in talents he never speaks to them in a tone of superiority  but upon every occasion as a sincere and sympathetic friend Pray observe from the following passage in this correspondence how the supposed advocate for universal licentiousness in youth speaks to those he loved on the education of their children  A father's care of his son's morals and manners is surely more useful than the critical knowledge of Homer and Virgil supposing that it were which it very seldom is acquired at schools I do not therefore hesitate to advise you to put your son to the best school that is the nearest to your usual place of residence that you may see and examine him often and strictly and watch his progress not only in learning but in morals and manners instead of trusting to  interested accounts of distant schoolmasters  Twelfth Letter to the Bishop of Waterford    But my esteem for Chesterfield in this point of view is principally founded on his character of his bosom friend my Lord Scarborough one of the most beautiful and pathetic portraits of an amiable but unhappy mind that was ever delineated by truth and tenderness so very beautiful that I think no one can read the composition short as it is without saying of its author This man had indeed a heart for friendship and the talent of describing those he loved in the genuine language of nature  Now turn to JohnsonIn all his elaborate volumes you discover no  vestiges of his having enjoyed the inestimable blessing of true cordial friendship no marks of that fond and amiable gratitude which has induced so many great authors to delineate and immortalize the persons who contributed to their happiness or their gloryIt has been observed that he never prefixed a dedication to any one of his various works a circumstance that argues to my apprehension not so much an independent as a proud unfeeling and surly spirit For though dedications have too often consisted of base flattery to opulence and grandeur they have frequently appeared as pleasing and graceful offerings to friendship and sometimes as a proper tribute to particular stations It is I think with equal malevolence and injustice that Johnson  accuses Addison of  servile absurdity  in dedicating his Opera of Rosamond to the Dutchess of Marlborough as the poet had exhibited in a prophetic scene of his drama the very mansion of which the just liberality of the kingdom had made this Lady the mistress His inscribing the Opera to her was surely an act of blameless and becoming civility This indeed is not the only instance of Johnson's malignity to Addison an author whose life whose writings and whose death exhibit such abundance of the purest merit that I can hardly think the man a true and perfect lover of genius or virtue who speaks of him in gross terms of sarcastic contempt  But to return to the article that I was speaking ofHad Johnson possessed  a heart for friendship he must have enjoyed all the reciprocal delights and advantages of that blessing in his long connexion with GarrickThey had set out hand in hand to make their way together through the chances of a world to which they were equally strangers and had jointly borrowed five pounds in a moment of mutual distress on the credit of the future Comedian Such a circumstance was almost sufficient in itself to have made them sincere friends for ever had their souls been of the true friendly temper as there seem to be few bonds of union more lasting among men than that of having passed through early hardships together In my own profession I have seen the force of this cement among our soldiers very wonderfully exemplified  But there were other considerations that might have made Johnson a cordial friend to Garrick Their talents were of so different a nature that no rivalship could exist between them and accordingly we find Garrick who was apt indeed to be alarmed at every shadow of a rival in his profession was ever ready to bestow the most hearty applause on the real merits of his old associate Patient under his dogmatical asperity and indulgent to his humour he almost revered and obeyed him as a parent yet the splenetic savage unsoftened by this filial homage had the barbarity to mortify this bosomfriend of his early and indigent days by excluding him from a little club to which he sued for admission This single anecdote of  Johnson is sufficient in my opinion to mark him for a brute  THE ARCHDEACON  You are running again my good friend into an excess of severity You forget that Garrick had his failings as well as Johnson perhaps greater failings without an equal counterpoise of perfection By talents of a class far inferior to those of the Philosopher he had risen to the intoxicating joys of opulent splendor and is said you know to have insulted by an ostentatious display of his magnificence his less fortunate old friend who like many other laborious men of letters had been a drudge for years without raising a competence for the decline of life For my own part I never think of these two  extraordinary men without lamenting in my heart that they so little exerted the great powers which they both possessed of contributing to the happiness and to the glory of each other You know my friend that although I am in some points as Lady Caroline calls me an idolater of Johnson I am far from adopting his gloomy ideas of human life On the contrary I think our earth which is often a pleasant habitation as it is would be for some years a delightful residence indeed if every man seized the opportunity of doing the noble things within his faculties to accomplish without indulging any malevolent or narrowminded ideasFor instance had Garrick possessed a great soul how happily might he have rescued his old friend from debasing himself in the eyes of  many by the acceptance of that pension to which he had hastily annexed in his dictionary so odious a definition How well might Garrick have spared from his ample revenue an annuity of equal value and how much would it have added to his reputation and delight if he had employed a part of that wealth which he derived from the partial liberality of the public in securing independence not only to the friend of his youth but to a mighty genius who from the peculiar infelicities that belong to authorship could hardly earn more than his daily bread by such exertions of intellect as do honour to his country  THE COLONEL  Had Garrick possessed the princely spirit to confer such a benefit which at times  I believe he really did your splenetic Philosopher had too much pride to accept itthough I perfectly agree with you in thinking it more pleasant and more honourable to receive the blessing of independence from the bounty of a friend than from the pension of a sovereign however gracious to whose family and title the heart of the pensioner was known to have been a rebel  LADY CAROLINE  You amaze me my dear disputants by agreeing in a point where I differ so widely from you both that I cannot refrain from an immediate declaration of my dissent  Surely to have accepted so large a gratuity from a subject however exalted must have been utterly inconsistent with  the dignity of Johnson In receiving a pension from a sovereign who has frequently shewn a disposition to correct the injustice of fortune towards literary genius he had the sanction of custom and of propriety in his favour  THE COLONEL  As this is a point that depends chiefly on delicacy of feeling you are probably in the right though I confess I cannot agree with youBut allow me to resume my argument It is clear that Johnson did not love Garrick though he had many reasons to do so and it is equally clear that the incurable envy of your moral Philosopher was the cause I want no additional proof that he was utterly unfit for true lasting friendship The friends of an envious man can have  no security for the continuance of his regard but their own insignificance If they happen by any successful talents to improve their title to his affection they will inevitably lose itAn attempt to maintain a friendship with an envious character will probably produce a disappointment very similar to what was lately felt by a naturalist of my acquaintance who intending to preserve a favourite rarity in a bottle of pure spirits found it put by mistake into a vessel of  aqua fortis  which annihilated the treasure that it was expected to preserve  THE ARCHDEACON  The force and aptitude of your simile is a full vindication of my Philosopher for while I agree with you that envy is in truth a corrosive of power sufficient  to annihilate friendship I must observe that the long intimacy which Johnson enjoyed with many respectable and celebrated names is a proof that if he was not perfectly exempt from this defect its existence only added to the triumphs of his virtue  THE COLONEL  I cannot agree with you in your conclusion for I find no public traces of his having praised the names you allude to in the language of perfect affection and surely those who have exhibited his character to the world rather speak of him as a prodigy they admired than as a friend they loved He was in truth so great a prodigy both in his faculties and his failings that I hardly think it possible for any man to have contracted  an intimacy with him much superior to the kind of friendship that subsists between a showman and the lion that he exhibits Indeed it has been observed that the favourite and most adroit leader of the monster who ventured to sport with him most familiarly could not always withdraw himself from his paw without severe laceration  THE ARCHDEACON  The preference that your fancy gives to Chesterfield against Johnson seems founded on your idea of your favourite's companionable attractions yet surely if the merits of the men might be fairly estimated by their powers of amusing a companion the Earl could not triumph on this ground for I apprehend his  conversation if compared to that of Johnson was like the soothing murmur of a rill compared to the majestic roar of a torrentAs to mirth no witty repartee of the noble Lord could more happily excite surprize and laughter than the lively sallies of Johnson both in prose and verse  But your imagination is so much haunted by ideas of his ferocity that you neither do justice to his wit nor to the acknowledged tenderness of his heartwhich was so singularly humane that I believe no author of his eminence ever afforded so much literary assistance to those who implored it Persons who have been distinguished by the public display of any talent are apt in general to entertain an important suspicious dread of debasing their dignity by condescending  to employ themselves in any petty work for a benevolent purposeFrom this frequent and ridiculous foible the great humanity of Johnson completely exempted him Whenever solicited by distress he was ready you know to contribute either a prologue or a petition  THE COLONEL  Do not suppose me so blind or so unjust as not to perceive and revere his signal readiness to assist the wretched He had certainly sincere and active compassion for great calamities but this is a cast of mind very different from that which leads a man to perfect amity with the prosperous and the eminent A poet who is more kind than severe to  the character of your Philosopher very truly and happily tells us  He proudly splenetic yet idly vain  Accepted flattery and dealt disdain  Poetical Review of Johnson by John Courtenay Esq    This disposition is indeed discernible in every portrait of Johnson and surely nothing can be more incompatible with the true spirit of friendship I conceive therefore that he entertained for the persons who were most beloved by him such a sort of regard as we may suppose the Manmountain to have bestowed on those halfflattered and halffrightened Lilliputians whom he deigned to elevate in the palm of his hand and for whom he sometimes condescended  to soften the portentous sound of his voice  But let me hasten to my second article and compare your Philosopher with Chesterfield as a periodical moralist  As our religion informs us that it is very difficult for a rich man to find the way to heaven so may we conceive that it is hardly less difficult for a man of quality business and fashion to render himself equal to our accomplished authors He who was nursed by vanity and tutored by pomp deserves I think no little praise if he has delivered moral lectures not inferior to those of a philosopher who had adversity to teach and poverty to inspire him In naming poverty I cannot help reminding you of your Philosopher's very singular opinion in regarding it as the only efficacious  inspirer an opinion which induces me to believe that had he been born in the rank of Chesterfield he would have proved if not the most sensual at least the most indolent of our modern voluptuaries But in the midst of many temptations to be idle and voluptuous we find my noble favourite exerting his natural and acquired talents to improve the morals of his countrymen and I will venture to affirm that the moral papers contained in his miscellaneous works are full as well if not better calculated to answer their purpose than those pompous dissertations of your Philosopher where the two authors afford the fairest ground for a comparison in the similarity of their subject As a strong case in point I beg you to compare at your leisure the admirable  paper in Chesterfield on the luxury of the table which forms the sixteenth number of a periodical work intitled Common Sense with the paper on gluttony in your favourite RamblerIf you compare also the introductory number in each of these publications you will clearly perceive I think that the talents of Chesterfield were more suited than those of Johnson to the production of attractive and useful little lectures on life and manners If you want farther proofs of this assertion you may find them I am persuaded in the papers that he contributed to  The World  particularly those on drinking and civility which live in the memory of every readerAs Moralists they seem to bear the same relation to each other that exists between the elegant  the penetrating Horace and the forcible declamatory Juvenal The engaging ease of Chesterfield's style and the sportive graces of his wit were peculiarly adapted to render him excellent as the essayist of a day When they are compared together in this light Johnson is to Chesterfield what the Piony is to the Roseof a grander form of more forcible and richer colouring yet not so pleasant to be surveyed with distant admiration but not eagerly received into the bosom  THE ARCHDEACON  I will not be so barbarous to your flowery metaphor as to say that I presume you mean only the Cankerrose  LADY CAROLINE  Very well my good friendthis is a fair and very gentle touch of retaliation for all the severity with which your admired Philosopher has been treated I confess I have expected you to retaliate with much greater warmth on the weak side of your antagonistI mean the irreligion of his favourite  THE ARCHDEACON  To speak honestly I could not in my conscience attack my adversary on that ground for I perfectly recollect that Lord Chesterfield repeatedly inculcates not only the most decent respect to religion herself but to all her ministers I am afraid indeed that his religious sentiments were not such as I who am  by no means one of his profest admirers most sincerely wish them to have been yet as this is a business between his own heart and Heaven I do not conceive that any man has a right to suppose him an infidel and then to censure him on the suppositionThis would be contrary to the fundamental principles of English liberty and justice not to speak of it as a violation of Christian charity  THE COLONEL  I reverence you my worthy friend for this candour and wish it were universalChesterfield is condemned as irreligious yet so far from finding any traces of this offence in his writings I find that in one of his French letters he expressly condemns the irreligion of  Voltaire partial as he was to that enchanting writer from a personal acquaintanceChesterfield is also condemned as a Frenchified fop yet no man has written more forcibly against our copying the follies of France Indeed no man seems to have better understood or more highly valued the liberties of his country and with what spirit he could support the manly frankness and undaunted truth of the English character in speaking to a Frenchman we have a striking example in his letter to the Abbé de la Ville the French minister at the Hague on several particulars relating to the battle of Fontenoy He has indeed been cruelly depreciated Your Philosopher you know very mercifully considered him as a  rotten post  to use his own gentle phrase  but if there were some unsound parts and who is perfect in the character of the noble Lord there was I apprehend a still larger portion of touchwood in the Philosopher himselfI have never seen the letter in which he renounced the patronage that he appeared to have contemplated with no little satisfaction but from all the accounts that I have met with of that incident I think we may rather blame the splenetic pride of Johnson than the insolence or meanness of ChesterfieldIn the sarcasms which they levelled at each other the latter surely approaches nearest to the truth the Critic was unquestionably more like a savage than the Wit was like a dancingmasterChesterfield had his foibles and his vices He was in his early life a slave to the tyrannous vice  of gaming but how ingenuously and parentally does he confess and lament it in his lettersand give me leave to add that he once derived no little honour from a signal victory over this despotic passion I allude to his conduct as Lord Lieutenant of IrelandYou know that he banished gaming entirely from the castle of Dublin and surely the man is entitled to credit for some nobleness of mind who enters on the exercise of sovereign power by the sacrifice of his own darling defectBelieve me I am not blind to his private failings and I heartily wish for his own happiness that they had never existed but I still assert that he had public merit sufficient to balance all his imperfections Let hypocrisy and malevolence or if you please let virtue herself deride him to the uttermost  as a vain and licentious puppet of qualityI shall never cease to think that he has many genuine claims to that lasting glory which he had the spirit to love and to pursue nor is he less entitled to the grateful remembrance of our country than the arrogant and splenetic dogmatist who has vilified the heroism of our Kings and the genius of our Bards a writer of verses not from the impulse of nature but the suggestions of interest or spleen a critic not from an enthusiastic delight in poetry but an envious hatred to poets  THE ARCHDEACON  That is a point which Time will settle with his usual unfailing justiceThough mankind are not always happy enough to distinguish their real friends from  their foes yet their judgment is generally just when the candidate for their applause has nothing to trust to but the posthumous influence of his worksWhatever charity may hope concerning the supposed irreligion of Chesterfield his immorality has too glaring an appearance to admit any doubt of its existence and the man who is vain and profligate enough to boast of his vices is I must confess in my opinion very far from deserving such an advocate as your favourite has found Indeed the more rigid friends of virtue and religion may almost blush with indignation in seeing two characters so very different compared to each otherJohnson the refuge and the friend of every being in distress compared to the ostentatious man of quality who affected to be the patron of  talents which he wanted erudition to estimate and liberality to rewardJohnson the eternal Moralist who made every social amusement a step in the acquisition of knowledge or in the improvement of the heart compared to the licentious Wit whose only ambition was to dazzle and amuseJohnson to hasten at once to that aweful scene where the comparison is not only most obvious but most importantJohnson closing a life of virtue and religion with faith in his Redeemer and with humility sufficient to tremble with aweful doubts of his own exemplary merit compared to Chesterfield finishing a frivolous and dissolute existence with the affected severity of a pagan Philosopher  THE COLONEL  If either party could have reason to blush indignantly at the comparison I maintain it must be ChesterfieldChesterfield the enchanting companion whose conversation was a model of the most enlivening politeness compared to the surly dogmatist whose habitual discourse was a compound of arrogance and spleenChesterfield the accomplished the diligent ambassador who never lost a morning hour compared to the lazy Moralist who tells us he wasted half his life in resolving to rise early and in breaking that resolveChesterfield the friendly editor the just and delicate panegyrist of one elegant and tender poet compared to the invidious biographer who has scattered  his inexhaustible gall over the whole choir of British bardsChesterfield the patriotic senator pleading with elegance and energy for the freedom of the stage compared to the servile author induced by his political bigotry to write against the liberty of the pressChesterfield the beneficent viceroy who governed Ireland in such a manner as to merit and receive the praise and benedictions of that lively people compared to the moody traveller who visited Scotland to insult its nakedness and to pour his superstitious execrations on the innocent descendants of its too zealous reformerChesterfield in short to finish with that important scene in which all men however different in character and condition must inevitably afford room for the most striking comparisonChesterfield  I say the real Sage ready and willing to die employing his latest breath in kind attention to his friend compared to your pretended Philosopher who shuddered at the approaches of no early death with an excess of pusillanimous horror which has exposed him to a more apt comparison with the cowardly effeminate Mecaenas  LADY CAROLINE  A severe parallel indeed methodically drawn and delivered with an oratorical vehemence that I never saw you assume beforeBut as I have exalted myself into a judicial office lot me imitate my dear Colonel the grand court of justice among your favourite Athenians as those sapient judges always sate I think in the dark you  may allow me to be a little like them and let me forbid all the delusive insinuations of impassioned eloquenceI have still to request from you both a few remarks on the style of your respective favouritesThe Archdeacon I believe esteems Johnson the very Sampson of language as we lately heard him called by one of his more affected admirers  THE ARCHDEACON  Indeed Madam I think our language has infinite obligations to him and the Colonel who is a lover of spirit in every shape can hardly prefer the loose and feeble phraseology of Chesterfield or of Addison to the compact vigour of our energetic Philologist  THE COLONEL  Though you may probably think me severely prejudiced against your favourite in some points I trust you will not think so in the article of diction for I allow that we find frequent passages in Johnson where the amazing vigour of his expression is equalled by its beauty I recollect in his character of Dryden a sentence that shews us the wonderful powers of his language He there describes a tendency to talk nonsense in such terms as render it an object of great sublimity Do you remember the words I think they run thus  He delighted to tread upon the brink of meaning where light and darkness begin to mingle to approach the precipice of absurdity  and hover over the abyss of unideal vacancy  But there is an excellence which Johnson has very justly remarked in Dryden's language and which he greatly wanted himself The excellence I mean he describes in a paragraph that I have transcribed in my memorandums under the article we are speaking of Here it is  His style could not easily be imitated either seriously or ludicrously for being always equable and always varied it has no prominent or discriminative characters The Beauty who is totally free from disproportion of parts and features cannot be ridiculed by an overcharged resemblance  Life of Dryden    If the excellence of language may be estimated by this standard that of Johnson is assuredly very defective for nothing is more easy than to execute a caricatura of his style In reading him we are frequently tempted to exclaim as La Bruyere does on certain sermons O what a rich figure is the antithesis it produces a whole Rambler With a great command of words he certainly wanted the noble and graceful simplicity which we admire in the capital writers of every country from Homer Plato and Demosthenes down to that Addison whom the partizans of your Philosopher call a weak writer when compared to Johnson as there were once people in Rome who preferred the eloquence of Seneca to that of Cicero  The language of Chesterfield strikes me like a damsel in a fashionable morning dress of the most simple and captivating elegance That of Johnson is like a matron who has arrayed herself for some grand ceremonial and heightened the austere dignity of her form by all the rich stiffness of a flowery brocade  If I were to compare the style of your Philosopher with that of Addison I should say that Johnson has the spirit the grandeur and the monotony of the kettledrum Addison the rich variety of that sacred instrument which can equally delight us with airy sweetness and awful solemnity But as I am no connoisseur in the music of language perhaps my idea is not so just  as the opinion of some goodnatured critics upon style who while they are rattling a saltbox themselves have the kindness to tell their auditors there is no strength or body in the tones of an organ  Let me return to the diction of ChesterfieldThe best panegyric I can devise for it will be to read you the following paragraph addressed to him by your Philologist  I may hope my Lord that since you whose authority in our language is so generally acknowledged have commissioned me to declare my own opinion I shall be considered as exercising a kind of vicarious jurisdiction and that the power which might have been denied to my own claim  will be readily allowed me as the delegate of your Lordship  Johnson's Plan of an English Dictionary    You will readily allow my good friend that the man must have been no weak master in the science of words who could extort such a compliment from an author uncommonly sparing of literary courtesy to all living meritBut I will not launch out into new censures on your idol Indeed as he has so frequently excited my spleen by his severity towards various favourites of mine both in politics and poetry I may possibly harbour prejudices against him almost as violent and cruel as his ownyou I think have as strong a bias in his favour from your benevolent presumption that his real goodness was as  great as his ostentatious display of morality But my sister is a sort of neutral power who may fairly settle the difference between us and I am sure you will join with me in requesting her to give us I will not say her judgment for the word would alarm and terrify her diffidence but her genuine feelings towards the two characters in question  THE ARCHDEACON  I join indeed most heartily in your request and beg leave at the same time to remind Lady Caroline that she is the true perfect judge not only of moral but of literary merit according to an honest and candid sentiment of the mighty Critic himself who says you know in speaking with liberal praise of Gray's Elegy  By the common sense  of readers uncorrupted with literary prejudices after all the refinements of subtilty and the dogmatism of learning must be finally decided all claim to poetical honours  Life of Gray    LADY CAROLINE  You are very good to encourage me by such a quotation but I really have not confidence enough to deliver any thing like a formal opinion upon characters of such eminence even to you with whom I am so familiar I do not mean however to shrink entirely from your request which would I think be very unfair after the entertainment that I have received from you bothand to pretend that I have formed to myself no notions concerning two authors  whom you know I read very frequently would be a foolish sort of prudery indeed I shall tell you therefore very frankly how I have felt myself affected by your respective favouritesTo speak of them as men I never felt in my life the slightest wish to have been personally acquainted with either though in reading many authors and Addison in particular I have felt such a desireJohnson I think said to some young Lady  Miss I am a tame monster you may stroke me  If he said so for I do not recollect where I met with the anecdote I apprehend his expression was not perfectly trueHe certainly was not more than halftamedI do not believe that I could have been induced to give the fearless pat of friendly familiarity to either of these very opposite creatures I am persuaded  that my hand would have shrunk from Johnson as from a hedgehog and from Chesterfield if not as an adder too venomous to be touched yet certainly as an eel too slippery to be held For notwithstanding my brother's panegyric on the friendly qualities of his idol I cannot think that either he or the Philosopher had a heart truly formed for that tender connection They seem to me to have possessed an equal degree of selfishness though it shewed itself under very different shapesone was continually trying to bully and the other to inveigle the world into an exclusive admiration of his particular talents The men accuse our sex of being actuated by a spirit of rivalship and mutual injustice to each other Yet surely this is not only as visible among  themselves but more productive of general disadvantage What the Archdeacon observed of Johnson and Garrick leads me to make a similar observation on Johnson and Chesterfield Had these two men of rare and different talents instead of kindling into a contemptuous animosity contracted a solid friendship on the noble plan of honouring of enjoying the perfections and correcting the deficiencies of each other how infinitely might such conduct have contributed to the pleasure improvement happiness and lasting glory of both But the defects in each were too strong to let him derive all possible delight and advantage from the faculties of the other Great as they both were in their separate lines I cannot think that either was truly entitled to the epithet of amiable  or good for I am equally offended by truth that is delivered with brutality and by politeness that is utterly insincere I own myself as much an enemy to the splenetic malevolence of Johnson as to the licentious vanity of Chesterfield Could they have blended their better qualities could the gaiety of the Wit have cured the spleen of the Philosopher and could the strong intellect of Johnson have annihilated the libertinism of Chesterfield each might have been what I think neither was a truly accomplished and happy man and each might have been rendered by such a process a more perfect and delightful writer for as it is though we admire the wonderful understanding and energy of mind displayed by Johnson though we are charmed by the wit elegance and knowledge  of the world that we find in Chesterfield yet it is certain that each fails us in the very point where from his particular pursuits we might naturally suppose it most safe to take him as a guide The literary judgments of Johnson and the worldly admonitions of Chesterfield appear to me equally unsound The first are surely not consistent with truth and justiceand for the latter I am afraid no apologist can perfectly reconcile them to honesty and virtue Yet there is such a mass of real though different excellence united to the gross failings of those two authors that as a parent anxious to collect every thing that may render me useful to my children I read them both with equal eagerness and I find much innocent instruction in Chesterfield that a mother's heart  is inclined to adopt Let rigid Moralists tell me if they please that all his parental merit is of the womanish kind and that he is at best  Fine by defect and delicately weak  As to Johnson I have indeed many jarring ideas of his excellencies and defects yet I believe I may give you my notion of his character comprized in a line by which Pope has described the whole species I shall conclude therefore by telling you that he was to my apprehension  A Being darkly wise and rudely great  THE COLONEL  Admirably appliedYou have expressed in a single verse what I laboured  to say ineffectually in a great deal of proseSo adieu for this morning  THE ARCHDEACON  Stay Coloneldo not leave us so hastily  THE COLONEL  I must be gonebut I will not shut the door without remarking that if Chesterfield had known our Lady he would have thought better of women than he did and if Johnson had possessed your true christian virtues my dear Doctor he would have been a much happier being than he wasSo farewell  FINIS
