 THREE SHORT LETTERS TO THE  People of England  PROVING THE PUBLIC GRIEVANCES COMPLAINED OF TO BE  IDEAL  By the REVD DR JOHN TRUSLER  Brother Citizens c  IN the present disturbed state of the people whose minds may have been misled by misrepresentation and false argument permit me to interfere and explain matters in their true and proper light  Our eyes have for some time past been turned towards the French nation They certainly had long been ruled by a rod of iron and there is no wonder that they groaned under it Their monarchy was despotic the King and his Ministers could levy taxes without the consent of the people they could imprison at pleasure  even without trial and the privileges of their nobility were so great that they were almost as despotic as their monarch As all men are upon an equality by birthright that is to say as all men by nature have a claim to the same natural privileges those who enjoy these privileges as I shall shew we do could not but exult at the spirit of the French in throwing of the yoke they laboured under and in new modelling their constitution they have in general adopted that of the British  Ours is a mild monarchical government we dread not the tyranny or evils of despotism We have a Magna Charta that prevents fines being excessive or more than we are able to pay so that no man need ever fear perpetual imprisonment a habeas corpus act which judges are obliged to attend to to bring us before a court and make us acquainted with the reasons of our imprisonment our Judges are appointed for life that they may be independant of administration and we are tried for our offences by a jury of our own countrymen The life and property of every individual is secured by law nor is there an injury man can sustain either in his person or his effects that he cannot meet with redress in I will allow that redress in some cases is expensive and happy for us that it is so or the litigious would always be at law Our money is not taken from us but with our own consent and we give our concurrence to every act of Parliament that passes  If such be the blessings of our own government what motive can we have to change it It is idle to think of  any  change except for the better and what security have we if this government was a republican tomorrow that we should have fewer placemen or less venality in Parliament The business of administration must go on and if there is an evil it is in the people themselves who put the members to such an expence for a seat in parliament and chuse such mercenary representatives that as Sir Robert Walpole used to say they will not vote even according to their consciences without a reward We have had patriot ministers in the whig interest who though on their coming into office set their faces against corruption found nothing was to be done with out it and of course were in some measure obliged to follow the step of their predecessors It is not my design here to point out where the remedy lies it certainly does not lie in a change of our constitution For whether there is a King or not me  in high office may have it in their power to use the public money improperly I will now enquire into the nature of these oppressions we complain of  Is our Government in general oppressiveNo Has not the experience of the last hundred years taught us that our government has been mild and that administration has been continually struggling for the interest of the people at large Does not every session of parliament produce fresh salutary laws not laws of oppression but laws to secure the ease and property of the subject to encourage inventions prevent scarcity and promote trade  Has not all our commercial treaties had for their object the good of this country  Has not our wars our interference with foreign states tended to the same end namely to the peace of Europe and ultimately to our own peace  If foreign wars and foreign connexions have increased the national debt is it a debt that overloads us Are  we not able to bear this debtDoes not our stocks rise under it And are we not notwithstanding in the highest credit both at home and abroad  Is the national debt then a grievanceNoI will admit it is owing to this that we are taxed so high in order to pay the interest of that debt but it does not follow that such taxes are a grievance But for such taxes every article of life would be cheaper What then If a labouring man who cannot live now for less than l a year could maintain himself for ten pounds instead of receiving eighteenpence a day for his labour his employer would pay him but half the money he would not be a shilling the richer When the quartern loaf was sold for fourpence a day labourer in the country had only tenpence a day now it is sold for d he has sixteenpence He therefore suffers not by the dearness of provisions Forty years ago when the articles of life were forty per cent cheaper the wages of a woman servant was three or four pounds that of a man servant five or six pounds now they are treble the sum Every thing is advanced in equal proportion Land let at s an acre at the time I speak of is now let at s and a load of wheat that then sold for l wil now fetch l or l and was I say the national debt paid off and the nation required only a revenue of three millions instead of millions the consequence to the public would be worse than at present Every thing would fall in its price and the only benefit if it can be so called that the people would derive from it would be a little more ease The present dearness of things is a spur to industry and invention and this I trust will be allowed to conduce to the health the happiness and the wealth of individuals Look at Spain the exigencies of that government are drawn from their mines in America when money is wanted they do not levy taxes on the people and what is the consequence Articles of living are cheap the people are idle but they have little or no trade  But surely idleness which is the parent of evil and ill health can never be deemed a happiness I need only appeal here to the busy and industrious and ask them whether they are ever more unhappy than when time hangs heavy on their hands and they have nothing to do  The national debt large as it is then is no grievance lessening it indeed might be attended with some advantage to the lower class of people as it may enable the ministers to take off some of those taxes that more immediately affect that class This our present minister with great credit to himself has been studying to do and has done for some years past but was the whole debt paid off it would be an injury to this country instead of a benefitIn the first place it would as I have observed by lowering the prices of the articles of living tend to make the people idle lessen our wealth and consequence and make us less respectable in the eyes of the world In the next place if it requires ten millions of money to pay the interest of the debt let us consider how many millions of people it tends to support not only commissioners taxgatherers clerks c but those who have money in the funds There is scarce a poor man but has some friend who has money there lodged If the nation at large did not want to borrow money how would those who have money to spare employ it They might lend it to others on mortgage who would often cheat them Land they would not be able to purchase for landholders would live so much cheaper than they do now that they would have no occasion to sell in  short the consequence would be that the people as I have said would not be so industrious the less money they wanted the less they would work and of course would not be so rich as they are  On the same principle the million of money annually allotted for the support of the Crown is no grievance that money is spent in the country for money cannot legally be carried out of it Whatever property is sent out of the country is sent in manufactures for which the inhabitants have been paid and of course have enjoyed the fruits of  So again though I am no advocate for squandering suppose some money is idly or profusely expended by the state This may be the case in the opinion of some perhaps not so in that of others but admit itWhat then All this money so spent reverts to the people again in a thousand ways it being spent in the country and thus encourages arts sciences trade manufactures and commerce Besides let this be ever such a grievance it is not an object of that magnitude as to make a change of constitution necessary to remedy it  LETTER II  Let me now ask What are the great oppressions we complain of Is it a standing army We see the necessity of this Its great and first use is to keep other nations in awe of us who would otherwise overrun us as did the Saxons and Danes formerly and as the French have done Savoy and Brab  nt its second use is to keep the violent and ungovernable in order to enforce the laws made by ourselves for our own safety and security and suffer the well disposed to enjoy their case and property unmolested We have seen this use of the army in the plots in London in the year  and in the riots last year at Birmingham where the mischief done fell upon the towns at large  Quartering of soldiers on publichouses has been considered as oppressive but as the profession of a publican is a continued bustle a military inmate or two is scarce noticed among the crowd and the expence the publican is put to is paid by his customers for whilst another tradesman is contented with per cent profit the publican charges per cent and often more so that the quartered soldier is fed by the guests that frequent that house  In large manufacturing towns such as Birmingham Coventry c quartering of soldiers on publichouses has been found for many political reasons improper Administration whose eyes are always open to the interests of the people seeing this have ordered barracks to be erected in such towns  Are Tithes an oppressionNo A tenth part of the produce of labour and cultivation has been appropriated from the earliest ages of the world for the maintenance of the clergy and where the farmer has not withheld this tenth there has been no dispute between the Farmer and the Parson Our Saviour enjoined his disciples to contribute to their support if then they are to be paid by the Farmer why not pay it in kind as well as in money It saves the farmer the trouble of converting that kind into money But the fact is that it is not the farmer who pays the tithe but his Landlord When a farmer enters into treaty for a farm he considers or at least he ought to consider not only the nature of the soil what it will produce what distance he has to carry it to market but what tithe what taxes he has to pay what services his landlord requires of him what restrictions he binds him to what mischief he shall  sustain by hunters and what injuries are done him by the game and game laws All these things he adds to the expence of cultivation and the rent required and then by calculating the produce of the land he judges whether he shall be able to pay that rent and maintain himself and family if not he either gives a reduced rent or declines the farm So that in fact it is his landlord that pays both tithes taxes and every other outgoing for land that is tithefree lets for more than land equally good that is not so  By the same way of reasoning every tax is paid ultimately by the monied men of this kingdom Those who have no settled income must live These live by their labour or their industry If they are employed as servants in mere manual labour their wages are proportioned to the dearness or cheapness of the several articles of life as I have before shewn in this case the taxes on such articles are paid by their employers If a man lives by manufacturing goods he like the farmer considers every expence he pays in such manufacturing and puts a price upon the articles accordingly so a to yield him sufficient profit to maintain himself here also again the taxes are paid by the consumer the monied man so it is in houserent A house with l a year with the taxes paid by the tenant would fetch l a year if the taxes were paid by the landlord It is the landlord then that pays the taxes not the tenantNow if the monied men and men of landed property in this kingdom do not complain why should the lower class who are in no case the sufferers  The same arguments will hold good with respect to the game which has idly been considered as an oppression Who say they has as good a right to the game upon a farm as the farmer who feeds it I have shewn that the farmer does not feed it but at the expence of his landlord for if a country was as much overrun with foxes as it may be with partridges and hares so that a farmer could not keep geese or poultry if he thought proper to take a farm in such a country he would pay a rent in proportion and thus throw the grievance on his landlord A landlord reserves the game to himself as he does the timber and every farmer knows that the headlands of a field abounding with timber produce smaller crops than the more open parts of the same field and why Because such timber overshadows the land beneath and draws it and their roots spreading out into the headlands draw their nourishment and are fed from such headlands The farmer then feeds the timber on his farm in the same manner as he does the game and yet never presumes to have any claim upon the timber when reserved to his landlord nor yet makes complaint of any injury he sustains when such timber is felled The same reasoning is applicable to the game The laws have reserved it for the benefit and diversion of the landholder and his friends The poorer class of men are restrained from sporting as labourers are from playing skittles and other games at publichouses that nothing shall draw them off from their employs to the detriment of their masters their families and the state The injury done by lords of manors and their keepers on sown lands and in the destruction of fences in the end falls on the owner of the soil as he gets a less rent for it in proportion to the mischief he does  Why should the rich say the envious poor be allowed more recreation than usBecause they can afford to waste part of their time which the poor cannot Why has one man more sense more abilities than another  It is a gift and dispensation of Providence Some are born to rule some to serve Was all mankind upon an equality the order of things would be overthrown and life could not go on Our Creator has ordained that there shall be different ranks and degrees of men It has been so from the beginning of time and will continue to the end of it It is not that a poor man is less respectable in  his  eyes than a rich man if he acquits himself well in the state in which it has pleased God to place him and a poor man never loses his consequence in society but when he is disorderly and does not fulfil the office assigned him A poor man is equally respectable in society also if he is a useful member of it and his equality with the rich is shewn and seen by his usefulness As the servant cannot do without a master so the master cannot do without a servant a good servant is always as valuable to a master as a good master is to a servant They are equal in point of utility as members of the same society and subjects of the same state  LETTER III  I cannot suppose any man of common understanding can object to certain distinctions of rank if titles please the possessors of them why not indulge them in their fancies when they tend not to the injury of society They serve to distinguish old families and when titles and honours are conferred for services to the state they become rewards and encouragements to similar services There might be political reasons for abol  shing titles in France the nobility there were as I have observed by their great privileges exempt from certain laws that bound the rest of the people and were almost as despotic as their monarch Exalted then and blown up by their rank they not only looked down on the common people with contempt but often treated them contemptuously in destroying therefore their privileges it was thought prudent and politic to abolish their rank also to put them on an equality with their fellowcitizens and thus prevent any future attempts in them to exalt themselves again With us the case is different our nobility are amenable to the same laws as the poorest man among us they associate and intermarry with commoners and look up to commercial men with respect Abolishing titles then or rank is an object of no moment much less of that magnitude as to sacrifice our constitution to acquire it  Are Manors and manerial rights oppressive No There are advantages in copyhold estates superior to freehold if a man is disposed to lend a sum of money on such an estate he can by examining the court roll see if it is free from incumbrances as he can in the case of freeholds in registered counties If a copyholder pays a heriot at his death and a fine on alienation that fine by law cannot exceed the custom of the manor or two years rent of the estate and in consequence of these exactions he who buys a copyhold estate pays less for the purchase than if the estate was free But if a copyholder is disposed to pay the lord as much money as the estate would sell for more if free there are few lords of manors but would free such estates and the copyholder might be a freeholder when he pleases This considered he has no more right to complain at not having a vote for the county than the man who has no estate at all  Is the Inequality of the landtax an oppressionNo He who purchased land where four shillings in the pound is paid boug  t it at a less price than  he who purchased where sixpence only is paid Every thing fetches its real value of course there is no cause of complaint here  Is the Inequality of representation an oppressionNo There are large manufacturing towns as Birmingham Sheffield c that send no members to Parliament nor have they a wish to do it under the present mode of election as it would create great confusion and disturbance in such towns They conceive themselves safe in the choice of their country men and will leave their property under the guardianship of the Parliament chosen by other people  It is not my business here to enter into the venality and corruption of Parliaments or to say how far a more equal representation a more frequent choice of members a more summary mode of election or other reforms may be conducive to the greater happiness of the people Such have been long wished for and such a reform has been thought necessary even by the present administration But there is a time for all things the time to enter into this is certainly not the present when the minds of the people are disturbed and when we are surrounded by tumult When such a business is set about quietness should reign among us and the matter should be coolly and dispassionately discussed and adjusted Was it to be entered into now there is no knowing where things would end it might end in the overthrow of the state  Is the House of Lords an oppressionNo "In the multitude of Counsellors there is safety" The Upper House consists of men of great landed property in this kingdom who have a great deal to lose and of course a great deal to guard men high in honour and understanding of men well versed by education in the laws of this country and of men equally so in the doctrines of christianity and surely such an assembly of men is proper to revise the acts of the people at large passed in the lower house of Parliament that are to enact laws to secure our property and our religion By our constitution they cannot make laws themselves but they can either ratify or reject and surely we may trust to them who are equally interested with us and who have abundantly more at stake If these men see no danger in the present system of things we surely have no reason to be alarmed They may say as do the sailors on board a ship in a storm to the passengers Don't be afraid look up to usthere is no occasion to be alarmed till you see  us  so"  Is the Insolence of taxgatherers or the servants of government an oppressionNo This when it occurs may be remedied by complaints made to their superiors in office and any grievance an individual may labour under by illegal seizure of his property if unreasonable or unfair is remedied by appeal  I have now gone through every kind of complaint that the people have to urge shewn the absurdity of those complaints and that there is no shadow of a plea for a change in our constitution Every thing cannot be done in a moment Let us leave the remedies we wish to time and the abilities of our representatives Consider what would be the consequence of a commotionnot only a great deal of bloodshed but a great deal of domestic wretchedness in every family distress would overspread the land and slaughter cloathe the whole country in  black  Cast your eyes on the French nationthe people there are become warriorsthere are few if any left to cultivate the land and  if their importation of provisions and the necessaries of life was interrupted and stopped by foreign powers as in all likelihood it may they must be starved into compliance Look to their manufacturing towns we are told that at Lyons there are manufacturers infirm men women and children who cannot carry arms starving for want of employ so it will be with usThere is not a man in trade but should an insurrection take place would immediately feel a loss and of course his family would feel a want and as to the men of property those who have most to lose would be the greatest sufferers If then my fellowcountrymen you value your own ease and comfort if your wives and children are dear to you do not sacrifice the whole in search of a phantom you never can grasp Listen not to the misguided opinions of those whose ignorance is the best excuse for their conduct Things have gone on very well since we have lived in the world and there is little doubt but that they will do the same whilst we continue in it The quieter a man passes thro' life the happier he is  J TRUSLER
