 under the direction of  Cooke Dec  r    THE CASTLE of OTRANTO A STORY Translated by WILLIAM MARSHAL Gent From the Original ITALIAN of ONUPHRIO MURALTO CANON of the Church of St NICHOLAS at OTRANTO  LONDON Printed for THO LOWNDS in FleetStreet MDCCLXV  THE TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE  THE following work was found in the library of an ancient Catholic family in the north of  England  It was printed at  Naples  in the black letter in the year How much sooner it was written does not appear The principal incidents are such as were believed in the darkest ages of Christianity but the language and conduct have nothing that savours of barbarism The stile is the purest  Italian  If the story was written near the time when it is supposed to have happened it must have been between the aera of the first crusade and the date of the last or not long afterwards There is no other circumstance in the work that can lead us to guess at the period in which the scene is laid The names of the actors are evidently fictitious and probably disguised on purpose Yet the  Spanish  names of the domestics seem to indicate that this work was not  composed until the establishment of the  Arragonian  Kings in  Naples  had made  Spanish  appellations familiar in that country The beauty of the diction and the zeal of the author moderated however by singular judgment concur to make me think that the date of the composition was little antecedent to that of the impression Letters were then in their most flourishing state in  Italy  and contributed to dispel the empire of superstition at that time so forcibly attacked by the reformers It is not unlikely that an artful priest might endeavour to turn their own arms on the innovators and might avail himself of his abilities as an author to confirm the populace in their ancient errors and superstitions If this was his view he has certainly acted with signal address Such a work as the following would enslave a hundred vulgar minds beyond half the books of controversy that have been written from the days of  Luther  to the present hour  This solution of the author's motives is however offered as a mere conjecture Whatever his views were or whatever effects the execution of them might have his work can only be laid before the public  at present as a matter of entertainment Even as such some apology for it is necessary Miracles visions necromancy dreams and other preternatural events are exploded now even from romances That was not the case when our author wrote much less when the story itself is supposed to have happened Belief in every kind of prodigy was so established in those dark ages that an author would not be faithful to the  manners  of the times who should omit all mention of them He is not bound to believe them himself but he must represent his actors as believing them  If this  air  of  the miraculous  is excused the reader will find nothing else unworthy of his perusal Allow the possibility of the facts and all the actors comport themselves as persons would do in their situation There is no bombast no similes flowers digressions or unnecessary descriptions Every thing tends directly to the catastrophe Never is the reader's attention relaxed The rules of the drama are almost observed throughout the conduct of the piece The characters are well drawn and still better maintained Terror the author's principal engine prevents the story from ever languishing  and it is so often contrasted by pity that the mind is kept up in a constant vicissitude of interesting passions  Some persons may perhaps think the characters of the domestics too little serious for the general cast of the story but besides their opposition to the principal personages the art of the author is very observable in his conduct of the subalterns They discover many passages essential to the story which could not be well brought to light but by their naivet√® and simplicity In particular the womanish terror and foibles of  Bianca  in the last chapter conduce essentially towards advancing the catastrophe  It is natural for a translator to be prejudiced in favour of his adopted work More impartial readers may not be so much struck with the beauties of this piece as I was Yet I am not blind to my author's defects I could wish he had grounded his plan on a more useful moral than this that  the sins of fathers are visited on their children to the third and fourth generation  I doubt whether in his time any more than at present ambition curbed its appetite of dominion from the dread of so remote a punishment And yet this moral is weakened by  that less direct insinuation that even such anathema may be diverted by devotion to St  Nicholas  Here the interest of the Monk plainly gets the better of the judgment of the Author However with all its faults I have no doubt but the  English  reader will be pleased with a sight of this performance The piety that reigns throughout the lessons of virtue that are inculcated and the rigid purity of the sentiments exempt this work from the censure to which romances are but too liable Should it meet with the success I hope for I may be encouraged to reprint the original  Italian  though it will tend to depreciate my own labour Our language falls far short of the charms of the  Italian  both for variety and harmony The latter is peculiarly excellent for simple narrative It is difficult in  English to relate  without falling too low or rising too high a fault obviously occasioned by the little care taken to speak pure language in common conversation Every  Italian  or  Frenchman  of any rank piques himself on speaking his own tongue correctly and with choice I cannot flatter myself with having done justice to my author in this respect His stile is as elegant as his conduct  of the passions is masterly It is pity that he did not apply his talents to what they were evidently proper for the theatre  I will detain the reader no longer but to make one short remark Though the machinery is invention and the names of the actors imaginary I cannot but believe that the groundwork of the story is founded on truth The scene is undoubtedly laid in some real castle The author seems frequently without design to describe particular parts  The chamber  says he  on the righthand the door on the lefthand the distance from the chapel to  Conrad'  s apartment  These and other passages are strong presumptions that the author had some certain building in his eye Curious persons who have leisure to employ in such researches may possibly discover in the  Italian  writers the foundation on which our author has built If a catastrophe at all resembling that which he describes is believed to have given rise to this work it will contribute to interest the reader and will make the castle of  Otranto  a still more moving story  THE CASTLE of OTRANTO A STORY  c  CHAPTER I  MANFRED  Prince of  Otranto  had one son and one daughter The latter a most beautiful virgin aged eighteen was called  Matilda Conrad  the son was three years younger a homely youth sickly and of no promising disposition yet he was the darling of his father who never showed any  symptoms of affection to  Matilda Manfred  had contracted a marriage for his son with the Marquis of  Vicenza  's daughter  Isabella  and she had already been delivered by her guardians into the hands of  Manfred  that he might celebrate the wedding as soon as  Conrad  's infirm state of health would permit  Manfred  's impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family and neighbours The former indeed apprehending the severity of their Prince's disposition did not dare to utter their surmises on this precipitation  Hippolita  his wife an amiable lady did sometimes venture to represent the danger of marrying their only son so early considering his great youth and greater infirmities but she never received any other answer than reflections on her own sterility who had given him but one heir His tenants and subjects were less cautious in their discourses They attributed this hasty wedding to the Prince's dread of seeing accomplished an ancient prophecy which was said to have pronounced that  the Castle and Lordship of  Otranto  should pass from the present family whenever the real owner should be grown too large to inhabit it  It was difficult to make any sense of this prophecy and still less easy to conceive what it had to do with the marriage in question Yet these mysteries or contradictions did not make the populace adhere the less to their opinion  Young  Conrad  's birthday was fixed for his espousals The company was assembled in the chapel of the Castle and every thing ready for beginning the divine office when  Conrad  himself was missing  Manfred  impatient of the least delay and who had not observed his son retire dispatched on of his attendants to summon the young Prince The servant who had not staid long enough to have crossed the court to  Conrad  's apartment came running back breathless in a frantic manner his eyes staring and foaming at the mouth He said nothing but pointed to the court The company were struck with terror and amazement The Princess  Hippolita    without knowing what was the matter but anxious for her son swooned away  Manfred  less apprehensive than enraged at the procrastination of the nuptials and at the folly of his domestic asked imperiously what was the matter The fellow made no answer but continued pointing towards the courtyard and at last after repeated questions put to him cried out oh The helmet the helmet In the mean time some of the company had run into the court from whence was heard a confused noise of shrieks horror and surprise  Manfred  who began to be alarmed at not seeing his son went himself to get information of what occasioned this strange confusion  Matilda  remained endeavouring to assist her mother and  Isabella  staid for the same purpose and to avoid showing any impatience for the bridegroom for whom in truth she had conceived little affection  The first thing that struck  Manfred  's eyes was a groupe of his servants endeavouring to raise something that appeared to him a mountain  of fable plumes He gazed without believing his sight What are ye doing cried  Manfred  wrathfully where is my son A volley of voices replied Oh My Lord The Prince the Prince the helmet the helmet shocked with these lamentable sounds and dreading he know not what he advanced hastilybut what a sight for a father's eyeshe beheld his child dashed to pieces and almost buried under an enormous helmet an hundred times more large than any casque ever made for human being and shaded with a proportionable quantity of black feathers  The horror of the spectacle the ignorance of all around how this misfortune had happened and above all the tremendous phaenomenon before him took away the Prince's speech Yet his silence lasted longer than even grief could occasion He fixed his eyes on what he wished in vain to believe a vision and seemed less attentive to his loss than buried in meditation on the stupendous object that had occasioned  it He touched he examined the fatal casque nor could even the bleeding mangled remains of the young Prince divert the eyes of  Manfred  from the portent before him All who had known his partial fondness for young  Conrad  were as much surprized at their Prince's insensibility as thunderstruck themselves at the miracle of the helmet They conveyed the disfigured corpse into the hall without receiving the least direction from  Manfred  As little was he attentive to the Ladies who remained in the chapel On the contrary without mentioning the unhappy Princesses his wife and daughter the first sounds that dropped from  Manfred  's lips were take care of the lady  Isabella  The domestics without observing the singularity of this direction were guided by their affection to their mistress to consider it as peculiarly addressed to her situation and flew to her assistance They conveyed her to her chamber more dead than alive and indifferent to all the strange circumstances she heard except the  death of her son  Matilda  who doated on her mother smothered her own grief and amazement and thought of nothing but assisting and comforting her afflicted parent  Isabella  who had been treated by  Hippolita  like a daughter and who returned that tenderness with equal duty and affection was scarce less assiduous about the Princess at the same time endeavouring to partake and lessen the weight of sorrow which she saw  Matilda  strove to suppress for whom she had conceived the warmest sympathy of friendship Yet her own situation could not help finding its place in her thoughts She felt no concern for the death of young  Conrad  except commiseration and she was not sorry to be delivered from a marriage which had promised her little felicity either from her destined bridegroom or from the severe temper of  Manfred  who though he had distinguished her by great indulgence had imprinted her mind with terror from his causeless rigour to such amiable Princesses as  Hippolita  and  Matilda  While the Ladies were conveying the wretched mother to her bed  Manfred  remained in the court gazing on the ominous casque and regardless of the crowd which the strangeness of the event had now assembled around him The few words he articulated tended solely to inquiries whether any man knew from whence it could have come Nobody could give him the least information However as it seemed to be the sole object of his curiosity it soon became so to the rest of the spectators whose conjectures were as absurd and improbable as the catastrophe itself was unprecedented In the midst of their senseless guesses a young peasant whom rumour had drawn thither from a neighbouring village observed that the miraculous helmet was exactly like that on the figure in black marble of  Alfonso  the Good one of their former Princes in the church of St  Nicholas  Villain What sayest thou cried  Manfred  starting from his trance in a tempest of rage and seizing the young man by the collar  how darest thou utter such treason thy life shall pay for it The spectators who as little comprehended the cause of the Prince's fury as all the rest they had seen were at a loss to unravel this new circumstance The young peasant himself was still more astonished not conceiving how he had offended the Prince Yet recollecting himself with a mixture of grace and humility he disengaged himself from  Manfred  's gripe and then with an obeisance which discovered more jealousy of innocence than dismay he asked with respect of what he was guilty  Manfred  more enraged at the vigour however decently exerted with which the young man had shaken off his hold than appeased by his submission ordered his attendants to seize him and if he had not been withheld by his friends whom he had invited to the nuptials would have poignarded the peasant in their arms  During this altercation some of the vulgar spectators had run to the great church which stood near the castle and came back  openmouthed declaring that the helmet was missing from  Alfonso  's statue  Manfred  at this news grew perfectly frantic and as if he sought a subject on which to vent the tempest within him he rushed again on the young peasant crying Villain Monster Sorcerer 'tis thou hast done this 'tis thou hast slain my son The mob who wanted some object within the scope of their capacities on whom they might discharge their bewildered reasonings caught the words from the mouth of their Lord and reecchoed ay ay 'tis he 'tis he He has stolen the helmet from good  Alfonso  's tomb and dashed out the brains of our young Prince with itnever reflecting how enormous the disproportion was between the marble helmet that had been in the church and that of steel before their eyes nor how impossible it was for a youth seemingly not twenty to weild a piece of armour of so prodigious a weight  The folly of these ejaculations brought  Manfred  to himself Yet whether provoked at the  peasant having observed the resemblance between the two helmets and thereby led to the farther discovery of the absence of that in the church or wishing to bury any fresh rumours under so impertinent a supposition he gravely pronounced that the young man was certainly a negromancer and that till the church could take cognizance of the affair he would have the Magician whom they had thus detected kept prisoner under the helmet itself which he ordered his attendants to raise and place the young man under it declaring he should be kept there without food with which his own insernal art might furnish him  It was in vain for the youth to represent against this preposterous sentence In vain did  Manfred  's friends endeavour to divert him from this savage and illgrounded resolution The generality were charmed with their Lord's decision which to their apprehensions carried great appearance of justice as the Magician was to be punished by the very instrument with which  he had offended Nor were they struck with the lest compunction at the probability of the youth being starved for they firmly believed that by his diabolical skill he could easily supply himself with nutriment  Manfred  thus saw his commands even chearfully obeyed and appointing a guard with strict orders to prevent any food being conveyed to the prisoner he dismissed his friends and attendants and retired to his own chamber after locking the gates of the castle in which he suffered none but his domestics to remain  In the mean time the care and zeal of the young Ladies had brought the Princess  Hippolita  to herself who amidst the transports of her own sorrow frequently demanded news of her Lord would have dismissed her attendants to watch over him and at last enjoined  Matilda  to leave her and visit and comfort her father  Matilda  who wanted no affectionate duty to  Manfred  though she trembled at his austerity obeyed the orders of  Hippolita  whom she tenderly recommended  to  Isabella  and enquiring of the domestics for her father was informed that he was retired to his chamber and had commanded that nobody should have admittance to him Concluding that he was immersed in sorrow for the death of her brother and fearing to renew his tears by the sight of his sole remaining child she hesitated whether she should break in upon his affliction yet solicitude for him backed by the commands of her mother encouraged her to venture disobeying the orders he had given a fault she had never been guilty of before The gentle timidity of her nature made her pause for some minutes at his door She heard him traverse his chamber backwards and forwards with disordered steps a mood which increased her apprehensions She was however just going to beg admittance when  Manfred  suddenly opened his door and as it was now twilight concurring with the disorder of his mind he did not distinguish the person but asked angrily who it was  Matilda  replied  trembling my dearest father it is I your daughter  Manfred  stepping back hastily cried Begone I do not want a daughter and flinging back abruptly clapped the door against the terrified  Matilda  She was too well acquainted with her father's impetuosity to venture a second intrusion When she had a little recovered the shock of so bitter a reception she wiped away her tears to prevent the additional stab that the knowledge of it would give to  Hippolita  who questioned her in the most anxious terms on the health of  Manfred  and how he bore his loss  Matilda  assured her he was well and supported his misfortune with manly fortitude But will he not let me see him said  Hippolita  mournfully will he not permit me to blend my tears with his and shed a mother's sorrows in the bosom of her Lord Or do you deceive me  Matilda  I know how  Manfred  doated on his son Is not the stroke too heavy for him has he not sunk under it You do not answer mealas I dread the  worstraise me my maidens I will I will see my Lord Bear me to him instantly He is dearer to me even than my children  Matilda  made signs to  Isabella  to prevent  Hippolita  's rising and both those lovely young women were using their gentle violence to stop and calm the Princess when a servant on the part of  Manfred  arrived and told  Isabella  that his Lord demanded to speak with her  With me cried  Isabella  Go said  Hippolita  relieved by a message from her Lord  Manfred  cannot support the sight of his own family He thinks you less disordered than we are and dreads the shock of my grief Console him dear  Isabella  and tell him I will smother my own anguish rather than add to his  As it was now evening the servant who conducted  Isabella  bore a torch before her When they came to  Manfred  who was walking impatiently about the gallery he started and said hastily take away that light and begone Then shutting the door impetuously he flung  himself upon a bench against the wall and bad  Isabella  sit by him She obeyed trembling I sent for you Lady said heand then stopped under great appearance of confusion My Lord Yes I sent for you on a matter of great moment resumed hedry your tears young Ladyyou have lost your bridegroomYes cruel fate and I have lost the hopes of my racebut  Conrad  was not worthy of your beautyhow my Lord said  Isabella  sure you do not suspect me of not feeling the concern I ought My duty and affection would have alwaysthink no more of him interrupted  Manfred  he was a sickly puny child and heaven has perhaps taken him away that I might not trust the honours of my house on so frail a foundation The line of  Manfred  calls for numerous supports My foolish fondness for that boy blinded the eyes of my prudencebut it is better as it is I hope in a few years to have reason to rejoice at the death of  Conrad  Words cannot paint the astonishment of  Isabella  At first she apprehended that grief had disordered  Manfred  's understanding Her next thought suggested that this strange discourse was designed to ensnare her She feared that  Manfred  had perceived her indifference for his son And in consequence of that idea she replied Good my Lord do not doubt my tenderness My heart would have accompanied my hand  Conrad  would have engrossed all my care and wherever fate shall dispose of me I shall always cherish his memory and regard your Highness and the virtuous  Hippolita  as my parents Curse on  Hippolita  cried  Manfred  Forget her from this moment as I do In short Lady you have missed a husband undeserving of your charms They shall now be better disposed of Instead of a sickly boy you shall have a husband in the prime of his age who will know how to value your beauties and who may expect a numerous offspring Alas My Lord said  Isabella  my mind is too sadly engrossed by the recent catastrophe  in your family to think of another marriage If ever my father returns and it shall be his pleasure I shall obey as I did when I consented to give my hand to your son But until his return permit me to remain under your hospitable roof and employ the melancholy hours in asswaging yours  Hippolita  's and the fair  Matilda  's affliction  I desired you once before said  Manfred  angrily not to name that woman From this hour she must be a stranger to you as she must be to mein short  Isabella  since I cannot give you my son I offer you myselfHeavens cried  Isabella  waking from her delusion what do I hear You My Lord You My fatherinlaw the father of  Conrad  the husband of the virtuous and tender  Hippolita  I tell you said  Manfred  imperiously  Hippolita  is no longer my wife I divorce her from this hour Too long has she cursed me by her unfruitfulness My fate depends on having sonsand this night I trust will give a new date to my  hopes At those words he seized the cold hand of  Isabella  who was halfdead with fright and horror She shrieked and started from him  Manfred  rose to pursue her when the moon which was now up and gleamed in at the opposite casement presented to his fight the plumes of the fatal helmet which rose to the height of the windows waving backwards and forwards in a tempestuous manner and accompanied with a hollow and rustling sound  Isabella  who gathered courage from her situation and who dreaded nothing so much as  Manfred  's pursuit of his declaration cried Look My Lord see heaven itself declares against your impious intentions Heaven nor hell shall impede my designs said  Manfred  advancing again to seize the Princess At that instant the portrait of his grandfather which hung over the bench where they had been sitting uttered a deep sigh and heaved its breast  Isabella  whose back was turned to the picture saw not the motion nor knew whence the sound came but started and said Hark my Lord What sound was that  and at the same time made towards the door  Manfred  distracted between the flight of  Isabella  who had now reached the stairs and yet unable to keep his eyes from the picture which began to move had however advanced some steps after her still looking backwards on the portrait when he saw it quit its pannel and descend on the floor with a grave and melancholy air Do I dream cried  Manfred  returning or are the devils themselves in league against me speak infernal spectre or if thou art my grandsire why dost thou too conspire against thy wretched descendent who too dearly pays fore'er he could finish the sentence the vision sighed again and made a sign to  Manfred  to follow him Lead on cried  Manfred  I will follow thee to the guiph of perdition The spectre marched sedately but dejected to the end of the gallery and turned into a chamber on the righthand  Manfred  accompanied him at a little distance full of anxiety and horror but resolved As he would have entered the chamber the door was clapped  to with violence by an invisible hand The Prince collecting courage from this delay would have forcibly burst open the door with his foot but found that it resisted his utmost efforts Since hell will not satisfy my curiosity said  Manfred  I will use the human means in my power for preserving my race  Isabella  shall not escape me  That Lady whose resolution had given way to terror the moment she had quitted  Manfred  continued her flight to the bottom of the principal staircase There she stopped not knowing whither to direct her steps nor how to escape from the impetuosity of the Prince The gates of the castle she knew were locked and guards placed in the court Should she as her heart prompted her go and prepare  Hippolita  for the cruel destiny that awaited her she did not doubt but  Manfred  would seek her there and that his violence would incite him to double the injury he meditated without leaving room for them to avoid the impetuosity of his passions  Delay might give him time to reflect on the horrid measures he had conceived or produce some circumstance in her favour if she could for that night at least avoid his odious purposeYet where conceal herself how avoid the pursuit he would infallibly make throughout the castle As these thoughts passed rapidly through her mind she recollected a subterraneous passage which led from the vaults of the castle to the church of St  Nicholas  Could she reach the altar before she was overtaken she knew even  Manfied  's violence would not dare to profane the sacredness of the place and she determined if no other means of deliverance offered to shut herself up for ever among the holy virgins whose convent was contiguous to the cathedral In this resolution she seized a lamp that burned at the foot of the staircase and hurried towards the secret passage  The lower part of the castle was hollowed into several intricate cloysters and it was not easy for one under so much anxiety to find the  door that opened into the cavern An awful silence reigned throughout those subterraneous regions except now and then some blasts of wind that shook the doors she had passed and which grating on the rusty hinges were reecchoed through that long labyrinth of darkness Every murmur struck her with new terror yet more she dreaded to hear the wrathful voice of  Manfred  urging his domestics to pursue her She trod as softly as impatience would give her leaveyet frequently stopped and listened to hear if she was followed In one of those moments she thought she heard a sigh She shuddered and recoiled a few paces In a moment she thought she heard the step of some person Her blood curdled she concluded it was  Manfred  Every suggestion that horror could inspire rushed into her mind She condemned her rash flight which had thus exposed her to his rage in a place where her cries were not likely to draw any body to her assistance Yet the sound seemed not to come from  behindif  Manfred  knew where she was he must have followed her She was still in one of the cloysters and the steps she had heard were too distinct to proceed from the way she had come Cheared with this reflection and hoping to find a friend in whoever was not the Prince she was going to advance when a door that stood a jar at some distance to the left was opened gently But e'er her lamp which she held up could discover who opened it the person retreated precipitately on seeing the light  Isabella  whom every incident was sufficient to dismay hesitated whether she should proceed Her dread of  Manfred  soon outweighed every other terror The very circumstance of the person avoiding her gave her a sort of courage It could only be she thought some domestic belonging to the castle Her gentleness had never raised her an enemy and conscious innocence bade her hope that unless sent by the Prince's order to seek her his servants would  rather assist than prevent her flight Fortifying herself with these reflections and believing by what she could observe that she was near the mouth of the subterraneous cavern she approached the door that had been opened but a sudden gust of wind that met her at the door extinguished her lamp and left her in total darkness  Words cannot paint the horror of the Princess's situation Alone in so dismal a place her mind imprinted with all the terrible events of the day hopeless of escaping expecting every moment the arrival of  Manfred  and far from tranquil on knowing she was within reach of somebody she knew not whom who for some cause seemed concealed thereabouts all these thoughts crouded on her distracted mind and she was ready to sink under her apprehensions She addressed herself to every Saint in heaven and inwardly implored their assistance For a considerable time she remained in an agony of despair At last as softly as was possible she  felt for the door and having found it entered trembling into the vault from whence she had heard the sigh and steps It gave her a kind of momentary joy to perceive an imperfect ray of clouded moonshine gleam from the roof of the vault which seemed to be fallen in and from whence hung a fragment of earth or building she could not distinguish which that appeared to have been crushed inwards She advanced eagerly towards this chasm when she discerned a human form standing close against the wall  She shrieked believing it the ghost of her betrothed  Conrad  The figure advancing said in a submissive voice be not alarmed Lady I will not injure you  Isabella  a little encouraged by the words and tone of voice of the stranger and recollecting that this must be the person who had opened the door recovered her spirits enough to reply Sir whoever you are take pity on a wretched Princess standing on the brink of destruction Assist me to escape from this fatal castle or in few moments I may be  made miserable for ever Alas said the stranger what can I do to assist you I will die in your defence but I am unacquainted with the castle and wantOh said  Isabella  hastily interrupting him help me but to find a trapdoor that must be hereabout and it is the greatest service you can do me for I have not a minute to lose Saying these words she felt about on the pavement and directed the stranger to search likewise for a smooth piece of brass inclosed in one of the stones That said she is the lock which opens with a spring of which I know the secret If we can find that I may escapeif not alas courteous stranger I fear I shall have involved you in my misfortunes  Manfred  will suspect you for the accomplice of my flight and you will fall a victim to his resentment I value not my life said the stranger and it will be some comfort to lose it in trying to deliver you from his tyranny Generous youth said  Isabella  how shall I ever requite as she uttered those words a ray of moonshine  streaming through a cranny of the ruin above shone directly on the lock they soughtOh transport said  Isabella  here is the trapdoor and taking out a key she touched the spring which starting aside discovered an iron ring Lift up the door said the Princess The stranger obeyed and beneath appeared some stone steps descending into a vault totally dark We must go down here said  Isabella  Follow me dark and dismal as it is we cannot miss our way it leads directly to the church of St  Nicholas  but perhaps added the Princess modestly you have no reason to leave the castle nor have I farther occasion for your service in few minutes I shall be safe from  Manfred  's rage only let me know to whom I am so much obliged I will never quit you said the stranger eagerly until I have placed you in safety nor think me Princess more generous than I am though you are my principal carethe stranger was interrupted by a sudden noise of voices that seemed approaching and they soon distinguished  these words Talk not to me of necromancers I tell you she must be in the castle I will find her in spite of enchantmentOh heavens cried  Isabella  it is the voice of  Manfred  make haste or we are ruined and shut the trapdoor after you Saying this she descended the steps precipitately and as the stranger hastened to follow her he let the door slip out of his hands it fell and the spring closed over it He tried in vain to open it not having observed  Isabella  's method of touching the spring nor had he many moments to make an essay The noise of the falling door had been heard by  Manfred  who directed by the sound hastened thither attended by his servants with torches It must be  Isabella  cried  Manfred  before he entered the vault she is escaping by the subterraneous passage but she cannot have got farWhat was the astonishment of the Prince when instead of  Isabella  the light of the torches discovered to him the young peasant whom he thought consined under the fatal  helmet Traitor said  Manfred  how camest thou here I thought thee in durance above in the court I am no traitor replied the young man boldly nor am I answerable for your thoughts Presumptuous villain cried  Manfred  dost thou provoke my wrath tell me how hast thou escaped from above thou hast corrupted thy guards and their lives shall answer it My poverty said the peasant calmly will disculpate them Though the ministers of a tyrant's wrath to thee they are faithful and but too willing to execute the orders which you unjustly imposed upon them Art thou so hardy as to dare my vengeance said the Princebut tortures shall force the truth from thee Tell me I will know thy accomplices There was my accomplice said the youth smiling and pointing to the roof  Manfred  ordered the torches to be held up and perceived that one of the cheeks of the enchanted casque had forced its way through the pavement of the court as his servants had  let it fall over the peasant and had broken through into the vault leaving a gap through which the peasant had pressed himself some minutes before he was found by  Isabella  Was that the way by which thou didst descend said  Manfred  It was said the youth But what noise was that said  Manfred  which I heard as I entered the cloyster a door clapped said the peasant I heard it as well as you What door said  Manfred  hastily I am not acquainted with your castle said the peasant this is the first time I ever entered it and this vault the only part of it within which I ever was But I tell thee said  Morfred  wishing to sind out if the youth had discovered the trapdoor it was this way I heard the noise My servants heard it toomy Lord interrupted one of them officiously to be sure it was the trapdoor and he was going to make his escape Peace blockhead said the Prince angrily if he was going to escape how should he come on this side I will know from his  own mouth what noise it was I heard Tell me truly thy life depends on thy veracity My veracity is dearer to me than my life said the peasant nor would I purchase the one by forfeiting the other Indeed young philosopher said  Manfred  contemptuously tell me then what was the noise I heard Ask me what I can answer said he and put me to death instantly if I tell you a lie  Manfred  growing impatient at the steady valour and indifference of the youth cried Well then thou man of truth answer was it the fall of the trapdoor that I heard It was said the youth It was said the Prince and how didst thou come to know there was a trapdoor here I saw the plate of brass by a gleam of moonshine replied he But what told thee it was a lock said  Manfred  How didst thou discover the secret of opening it Providence that delivered me from the helmet was able to direct me to the spring of a lock said he Providence should have gone a little farther and have placed thee out of the reach of my resentment  said  Manfred  When Providence had taught thee to open the lock it abandoned thee for a fool who did not know how to make use of its favours Why didst thou not pursue the path pointed out for thy escape Why didst thou shut the trapdoor before thou hadst descended the steps I might ask you my Lord said the peasant how I totally unacquainted with your castle was to know that those steps led to any outlet but I scorn to evade your questions Wherever those steps lead to perhaps I should have explored the wayI could not be in a worse situation than I was But the truth is I let the trapdoor fall Your immediate arrival followed I had given the alarm what imported it to me whether I was seized a minute sooner or a minute later Thou art a resolute villain for thy years said  Manfred  yet on reflection I suspect thou dost but trifle with me Thou hast not yet told me how thou didst open the lock That I will show you my Lord said the Peasant and taking up a fragment  of stone that had fallen from above he laid himself on the trapdoor and began to beat on the piece of brass that covered it meaning to gain time for the escape of the Princess This presence of mind joined to the frankness of the youth staggered  Manfred  He even felt a disposition towards pardoning one who had been guilty of no crime  Manfred  was not one of those savage tyrants who wanton in cruelty unprovoked The circumstances of his fortune had given an asperity to his temper which was naturally humane and his virtues were always ready to operate when his passions did not obscure his reason  While the Prince was in this suspence a confused noise of voices ecchoed through the distant vaults As the sound approached he distinguished the clamours of some of his domestics whom he had dispersed through the castle in search of  Isabella  calling out where is my Lord where is the Prince Here I am said  Manfred  as they came nearer have you found  the Princess the first that arrived replied oh my Lord I am glad we have found youfound me said  Manfred  have you found the Princess We thought we had my Lord said the fellow looking terrifiedbutbut what cried the Prince has she escaped  Jaquez  and I my Lordyes I and  Diego  interrupted the second who came up in still greater consternation speak one of you at a time said  Manfred  I ask you where is the Princess We do not know said they both together but we are frightened out of our witsso I think blockheads said  Manfred  what is it has scared you thusoh my Lord said  Jaquez    Diego  has seen such a sight your Highness would not believe our eyeswhat new absurdity is this cried  Manfred  give me a direct answer or by heav'nwhy my Lord if it please your Highness to hear me said the poor fellow  Diego  and Iyes I and  Jaquez  cried his comrade did not I forbid you to speak both at a time said the Prince You  Jaquez  answer  for the other fool seems more distracted than thou art What is the matter my gracious Lord said  Jaquez  if it please your Highness to hear me  Diego  and I according to your Highness's orders went to search for the young Lady but being comprehensive that we might meet the ghost of my young Lord your Highness's son God rest his soul as he has not received christian burialsot cried  Manfred  in a rage is it only a ghost then that thou hast seen oh worse worse my Lord cried  Diego  I had rather have seen ten whole ghostsgrant me patience said  Manfred  these blockheads distract meout of my sight  Diego  and thou  Jaquez  tell me in one word art thou sober art thou raving thou wast wont to have some sense has the other sot frightened himself and thee too speak what is it he fancies he has seen Why my Lord replied  Jaquez  trembling I was going to tell your Highness that since the calamitous misfortune of my young Lord God rest his precious soul not one of us your  Highness's faithful servants indeed we are my Lord though poor men I say not one of us has dared to set a soot about the castle but two together So  Diego  and I thinking that my young Lady might be in the great gallery went up there to look for her and tell her your Highness wanted something to impart to her O blundering fools cried  Manfred  And in the mean time she has made her escape because you were afraid of goblinsWhy thou knave she left me in the gallery I came from thence myself For all that she may be there still for ought I know said  Jaquez  but the devil shall have me before I seek her there againpoor  Diego  I do not believe he will ever recover it recover what said  Manfred  am I never to learn what it is has terrified these rascalsbut I lose my time follow me slave I will see if she is in the galleryfor heaven's sake my dear good Lord cried  Jaquez  do not go to the gallery Satan himself I believe is in the great chamber next to the gallery  Manfred  who hitherto had treated th  terror of his servants as an idle panic was struck at this new circumstance He recollected the apparition of the portrait and the sudden closing of the door at the end of the galleryhis voice faltered and he asked with disorder what is in the great chamber my Lord said  Jaquez  when  Diego  and I came into the gallery he went first for he said he had more courage than I So when we came into the gallery we found nobody We looked under every bench and stool and still we found nobodywere all the pictures in their places said  Manfred  Yes my Lord answered  Jaquez  but we did not think of looking behind themwell well said  Manfred  proceed When we came to the door of the great chamber continued  Jaquez  we found it shutand could not you open it said  Manfred  Oh yes my Lord would to heaven we had not replied henay it was not I neither it was  Diego  he was grown foolhardy and would go on though I advised him notif ever I open a door that is shut againtrifle  not said  Manfred  shuddering but tell me what you saw in the great chamber on opening the doorI my Lord said  Jaquez  I saw nothing I was behind  Diego  but I heard the noise  Jaquez  said  Manfred  in a solemn tone of voice tell me I adjure thee by the souls of my ancestors what was it thou sawest what was it thou heardst It was  Diego  saw it my Lord it was not I replied  Jaquez  I only heard the noise  Diego  had no sooner opened the door than he cried out and ran backI ran back too and said is it the ghost the ghost no no said  Diego  and his hair stood an endit is a giant I believe he is all clad in armour for I saw his foot and part of his leg and they are as large as the helmet below in the court As he said these words my Lord we heard a violent motion and the ratling of armour as if the giant was rising for  Diego  has told me since that he believes the giant was lying down for the foot and leg were stretched at length on the floor Before we could get to  the end of the gallery we heard the door of the great chamber clap behind us but we did not dare turn back to see if the giant was following usyet now I think on it we must have heard him if he had pursued usbut for heaven's sake good my Lord send for the chaplain and have the castle exorcised for for certain it is enchanted Ay pray do my Lord cried all the servants at once or we must leave your Highness's servicepeace dotards said  Manfred  and follow me I will know what all this means We my Lord cried they with one voice we would not go up to the gallery for your Highness's revenue The young peasant who had stood silent now spoke Will your Highness said he permit me to try this adventure my life is of consequence to nobody I fear no bad angel and have offended no good one Your behaviour is above your seeming said  Manfred  viewing him with surprise and admirationhereafter I will reward your braverybut now continued he with a sigh  I am so circumstanced that I dare trust no eyes but my ownhowever I give you leave to accompany me  Manfred  when he first followed  Isabella  from the gallery had gone directly to the apartment of his wife concluding the Princess had retired thither  Hippolita  who knew his step rose with anxious fondness to meet her Lord who she had not seen since the death of their son She would have flown in a transport mixed of joy and grief to his bosom but the pushed her rudely off and said Where is  Isabella Isabella  My Lord said the astonished  Hippolita  Yes  Isabella  cried  Manfred  imperiously I want  Isabella  My Lord replied  Matilda  who perceived how much his behaviour had shocked her mother she has not been with us since your Highness summoned her to your apartment Tell me where she is said the Prince I do not want to know where she has been My good Lord said  Hippolita  your daughter tells you the truth  Isabella  left us by your command  and has not returned sincebut my good Lord compose yourself Retire to your rest This dismal day has disordered you  Isabella  shall wait your orders in the morning What then you know where she is cried  Manfred  Tell me directly for I will not lose an instantand you woman speaking to his wife order your chaplain to attend me forthwith  Isabella  said  Hippolita  calmly is retired I suppose to her chamber She is not accustomed to watch at this late hour Gracious my Lord continued she let me know what has disturbed you Has  Isabella  offended you Trouble me not with questions said  Manfred  but tell me where she is  Matilda  shall call her said the PrincessSit down my Lord and resume your wonted fortitudeWhat art thou jealous of  Isabella  replied he that you wish to be present at our interview Good heavens my Lord said  Hippolita  what is it your Highness means Thou wilt know ere many minutes are passed said the cruel Prince Send  your chaplain to me and wait my pleasure here At these words he flung out of the room in search of  Isabella  leaving the amazed Ladies thunderstruck with his words and frantic deportment and lost in vain conjectures on what he was meditating  Manfred  was now returning from the vault attended by the peasant and a few of his servants whom he had obliged to accompany him He ascended the staircase without stopping till he arrived at the gallery at the door of which he met  Hippolita  and her chaplain When  Diego  had been dismissed by  Manfred  he had gone directly to the Princess's apartment with the alarm of what he had seen That excellent Lady who no more than  Manfred  doubted of the reality of the vision yet affected to treat it as a delirium of the servant Willing however to save her Lord from any additional shock and prepared by a series of grief not to tremble at any accession to it she determined to make herself the first sacrifice if fate had marked the  present hour for their destruction Dismissing the reluctant  Matilda  to her rest who in vain sued for leave to accompany her mother and attended only by her chaplain  Hippolita  had visited the gallery and great chamber and now with more serenity of soul than she had felt for many hours she met her Lord and assured him that the vision of the gigantic leg and foot was all a fable and no doubt an impression made by fear and the dark and dismal hour of the night on the minds of his servants She and the chaplain had examined the chamber and found every thing in the usual order  Manfred  though persuaded like his wife that the vision had been no work of fancy recovered a little from the tempest of mind into which so many strange events had thrown him Ashamed too of his inhuman treatment of a Princess who returned every injury with new marks of tenderness and duty he felt returning love forcing itself into his eyesbut not less ashamed of seeling remorse towards one against whom  he was inwardly meditating a yet more bitter outrage he curbed the yearnings of his heart and did not dare to lean even towards pity The next transition of his soul was to exquisite villainy Presuming on the unshaken submission of  Hippolita  He flattered himself that she wou'd not only acquiesce with patience to a divorce but would obey if it was his pleasure in endeavouring to persuade  Isabella  to give him her hand but e'er he could indulge this horrid hope he reflected that  Isabella  was not to be found Coming to himself he gave orders that every avenue to the castle should be strictly guarded and charged his domestics on pain of their lives to suffer nobody to pass out The young peasant to whom he spoke favourably he ordered to remain in a small chamber on the stairs in which there was a palletbed and the key of which he took away himself telling the youth he would talk with him in the morning Then dismissing his attendants and bestowing a sullen kind of halfnod on  Hippolita  he retired to his own chamber  CHAP II  MATILDA  who by  Hippolita  's order had retired to her apartment was illdisposed to take any rest The shocking fate of her brother had deeply affected her She was surprized at not seeing  Isabella  But the strange words which had fallen from her father and his obscure menace to the Princess his wife accompanied by the most furious behaviour had filled her gentle mind with terror and alarm She waited anxiously for the return of  Bianca  a young damsel that attended her whom she had sent to learn what was become of  Isabella Bianca  soon appeared and informed her mistress of what she had gathered from the servants that  Isabella  was no where to be found She related the adventure of the young peasant who  had been discovered in the vault tho' with many simple additions from the incoherent accounts of the domestics and she dwelled principally on the gigantic leg and foot which had been seen in the gallerychamber This last circumstance had terrified  Bianca  so much that she was rejoiced when  Matilda  told her that she would not go to rest but would watch till the Princess should rise  The young Princess wearied herself in conjectures on the flight of  Isabella  and on the threats of  Manfred  to her mother But what business could he have so urgent with the chaplain said  Matilda  Does he intend to have my brother's body interred privately in the chapel Oh Madam said  Bianca  now I guess As you are become his heiress he is impatient to have you married He has always been raving for more sons I warrant he is now impatient for grandsons As sure as I live Madam I shall see you a bride at lastGood Madam you won't cast off your faithful  Bianca  You wont  put  Donna Rosara  over me now you are a great Princess My poor  Bianca  said  Matilda  how fast your thoughts amble I a great Princess What hast thou seen in  Manfred  's behaviour since my brother's death that bespeaks any increase of tenderness to me No  Bianca  his heart was ever a stranger to mebut he is my father and I must not complain Nay if heaven shuts my father's heart against me it overpays my little merit in the tenderness of my mother O that dear mother yes  Bianca  'tis there I feel the rugged temper of  Manfred  I can support his harshness to me with patience but it wounds my soul when I am witness to his causeless severity towards her Oh Madam said  Bianca  all men use their wives so when they are weary of themand yet you congratulated me but now said  Matilda  when you fancied my father intended to dispose of me I would have you a great Lady replied  Bianca  come what will I do not wish to see you moped in a convent as you would be if you had your  will and if my Lady your mother who knows that a bad husband is better than no husband at all did not hinder youbless me what noise is that St  Nicholas  forgive me I was but in jest It is the wind said  Matilda  whistling through the battlements in the tower above You have heard it a thousand times Nay said  Bianca  there was no harm neither in what I said It is no sin to talk of matrimonyand so Madam as I was saying if my Lord  Manfred  should offer you a handsome young Prince for a bridegroom you would drop him a curtsy and tell him you had rather take the veil Thank heaven I am in no such danger said  Matilda  You know how many proposals for me he has rejectedand you thank him like a dutiful daughter do you Madambut come Madam suppose tomorrow morning he was to send for you to the great council chamber and there you should find at his elbow a lovely young Prince with large black eyes a smooth white forehead and manly curling  locks like jet in short Madam a young Hero resembling the picture of the good  Alfonso  in the gallery which you sit and gaze at for hours togetherdo not speak lightly of that picture interrupted  Matilda  sighing I know the adoration with which I look at that picture is uncommon but I am not in love with a coloured pannel The character of that virtuous Prince the veneration with which my mother has inspired me for his memory the orisons which I know not why she has enjoined me to pour forth at his tomb all have concurred to persuade me that some how or other my destiny is linked with something relating to himLord Madam how should that be said  Bianca  I have always heard that your family was no way related to his And I am sure I cannot conceive why my Lady the Princess sends you in a cold morning or a damp evening to pray at his tomb He is no Saint by the  Almanack  If you must pray why does not she bid you address yourself to our great St  Nicholas  I am sure he  is the Saint I pray to for a husband Perhaps my mind would be less affected said  Matilda  if my mother would explain her reasons to me But it is the mystery she observes that inspires me with thisI know not what to call it As she never acts from caprice I am sure there is some fatal secret at bottomnay I know there is In her agony of grief for my brother's death she dropped some words that intimated as much oh dear Madam cried  Bianca  What were they No said  Matilda  if a parent lets fall a word and wishes it recalled it is not for a child to utter it What was she sorry for what she had said asked  Bianca  I am sure Madam you may trust mewith my own little secrets when I have any I may said  Matilda  but never with my mother's A child ought to have no ears or eyes but as a parent directs Well to be sure Madam you was born to be a saint said  Bianca  and there is no resisting one's vocation You will end in a convent at last But there is my Lady  Isabella  would not be so reserved to me She will let me talk to her of young men and when a handsome cavalier has come to the castle she had owned to me that she wished your brother  Conrad  resembled him  Bianca  said the Princess I do not allow you to mention my friend disrespectfully  Isabella  is of a chearful disposition but her soul is pure as virtue itself She knows your idle babling humour and perhaps has now and then encouraged it to divert melancholy and enliven the solitude in which my father keeps usBlessed  Mary  said  Bianca  starting there it is againdear Madam Do you hear nothingthis castle is certainly hauntedpeace said  Matilda  and listen I did think I heard a voicebut it must be fancy your terrors I suppose have infected me Indeed indeed Madam said  Bianca  halfweeping with agony I am sure I heard a voice Does any body lie in the chamber beneath said the Princess Nobody has dared to lie there answered  Bianca  since the great astrologer that was your  brother's tutor drowned himself For certain Madam his ghost and the young Prince's are now met in the chamber belowfor heaven's sake let us fly to your mother's apartment I charge you not to stir said  Matilda  If they are spirits in pain we may ease their sufferings by questioning them They can mean no hurt to us for we have not injured themand if they should shall we be more safe in one chamber than in another Reach me my beads we will say a prayer and then speak to them Oh dear Lady I would not speak to a ghost for the world cried  Bianca  as she said those words they heard the casement of the little chamber below  Matilda  's open They listened attentively and in few minutes thought they heard a person sing but could not distinguish the words This can be no evil spirit said the Princess in a low voice It is undoubtedly one of the family open the window and we shall know the voice I dare not indeed Madam said  Bianca  Thou art a very fool said  Matilda  opening the window gently herself The noise  the Princess made was however heard by the person beneath who stopped and they concluded had heard the casement open Is any body below said the Princess If there is speak Yes said an unknown voice Who is it said  Matilda  A stranger replied the voice What stranger said she and how didst thou come there at this unusual hour when all the gates of the castle are locked I am not here willingly Answered the voicebut pardon me Lady if I have disturbed your rest I knew not that I was overheard Sleep had forsaken me I left a restless couch and came to waste the irksome hours with gazing on the fair approach of morning impatient to be dismissed from this castle Thy words and accents said  Matilda  are of a melancholy cast If thou art unhappy I pity thee If poverty afflicts thee let me know it I will mention thee to the Princess whose beneficent soul ever melts for the distressed and she will relieve thee I am indeed unhappy said the stranger and I know what wealth is But I do not complain of the  lot which heaven has cast for me I am young and healthy and am not ashamed of owing my support to myselfyet think me not proud or that I disdain your generous offers I will remember you in my orisons and will pray for blessings on your gracious self and your noble mistressif I sigh Lady it is for others not for myself Now I have it Madam said  Bianca  whispering the Princess This is certainly the young peasant and by my conscience he is in loveWell this is a charming adventure do Madam let us sift him He does not know you but takes you for one of my Lady  Hippolita  's women Art thou not ashamed  Bianca  said the Princess What right have we to pry into the secrets of this young man's heart he seems virtuous and frank and tells us he is unhappy Are those circumstances that authorize us to make a property of him how are we intitled to his confidence Lord Madam how little you know of love replied  Bianca  Why lovers have no pleasure equal to  talking of their mistress And would you have  me  become a peasant's confident said the Princess Well then let me talk to him Said  Bianca  Though I have the honour of being your Highness's maid of honour I was not always so great Besides if love levels ranks it raises them too I have a respect for any young man in lovepeace simpleton said the Princess Though he said he was unhappy it does not follow that he must be in love Think of all that has happened today and tell me if there are no misfortunes but what love causes Stranger resumed the Princess if thy misfortunes have not been occasioned by thy own fault and are within the compass of the Princess  Hippolita  's power to redress I will take upon me to answer that she will be thy protectress When thou art dismissed from this castle repair to holy father  Jerome  at the convent adjoining to the church of St  Nicholas  and make thy story known to him as far as thou thinkest meet He will not fail to inform the Princess who is  the mother of all that want her assistance Farewel It is not seemly for me to hold farther converse with a man at this unwonted hour May the Saints guard thee gracious Lady replied the peasantbut oh if a poor and worthless stranger might presume to beg a minute's audience fartheram I so happythe casement is not shutmight I venture to askspeak quickly said  Matilda  the morning dawns a pace Should the labourers come into the fields and perceive usWhat wouldst thou askI know not howI know not if I daresaid the young stranger falteringyet the humanity with which you have spoken to me emboldens Lady dare I trust youHeavens said  Matilda  What dost thou mean with what wouldst thou trust mespeak boldly if thy secret is fit to be entrusted to a virtuous breast I would ask said the Peasant recollecting himself whether what I have heard from the domestics is true that the Princess is missing from the castle What imports it to thee to  know replied  Matilda  Thy first words bespoke a prudent and becoming gravity Dost thou come hither to pry into the secrets of  Manfred  Adieu I have been mistaken in thee Saying these words she shut the casement hastily without giving the young man time to reply I had acted more wisely said the Princess to  Bianca  with some sharpness if I had let thee converse with this peasant His inquisitiveness seems of a piece with thy own It is not fit for me to argue with your Highness replied  Bianca  but perhaps the questions I should have put to him would have been more to the purpose than those you have been pleased to ask him Oh no doubt said  Matilda  you are a very discreet personage may I know what  you  would have asked him A bystander often sees more of the game than those that play answered  Bianca  Does your Highness think Madam that his question about my Lady  Isabella  was the result of mere curiosity No no Madam there is more in it than you great  folks are aware of  Lopez  told me that all the servants believe this young fellow contrived my Lady  Isabella  's escapenow pray Madam observeyou and I both know that my Lady  Isabella  never much fancied the Prince your brother Well he is killed just in the critical minuteI accuse nobody A helmet falls from the moonso my Lord your father says but  Lopez  and all the servants say that this young spark is a magician and stole it from  Alfonso  's tombhave done with this rhapsody of impertinence said  Matilda  Nay Madam as you please cried  Bianca  yet it is very particular tho' that my Lady  Isabella  should be missing the very same day and that this young sorcerer should be found at the mouth of the trapdoor I accuse nobodybut if my young Lord came honestly by his deathDare not on thy duty said  Matilda  to breathe a suspicion on the purity of my dear  Isabella  's famepurity or not purity said  Bianca  gone she isa stranger is found that nobody knows You question him  yourself He tells you he is in love or unhappy it is the same thingnay he owned he was unhappy about others and is any body unhappy about another unless they are in love with them and at the very next word he asks innocently poor soul if my Lady  Isabella  is missingto be sure said  Matilda  thy observations are not totally without foundation  Isabella  's flight amazes me The curiosity of this stranger is very particularyet  Isabella  never concealed a thought from meso she told you said  Bianca  to fish out your secretsbut who knows Madam but this stranger may be some Prince in disguisedo Madam let me open the window and ask him a few questions No replied  Matilda  I will ask him myself if he knows aught of  Isabella  He is not worthy that I should converse farther with him She was going to open the casement when they heard the bell ring at the posterngate of the castle which is on the righthand of the tower where  Matilda  lay This prevented the Princess from renewing the conversation with the stranger  After continuing silent for some time I am persuaded said she to  Bianca  that whatever be the cause of  Isabella  's flight it had no unworthy motive If this stranger was accessary to it she must be satisfied of his sidelity and worth I observed did not you  Bianca  that his words were tinctured with an uncommon effusion of piety It was no ruffian's speech His phrases were becoming a man of gentle birth I told you Madam said  Bianca  that I was sure he was some Prince in disguiseyet said  Matilda  if he was privy to her escape how will you account for his not accompanying her in her flight why expose himself unnecessarily and rashly to my Father's resentment As for that Madam replied she if he could get from under the helmet he will find ways of eluding your Father's anger I do not doubt but he has some talisman or other about himYou resolve every thing into magic said  Matilda  but a man who has  any intercourse with infernal spirits does not dare to make use of those tremendous and holy words which he uttered Didst thou not observe with what fervour he vowed to remember  me  to heaven in his prayersyes  Isabella  was cindoubtedly convinced of his piety Commend me to the piety of a young fellow and a damsel that consult to elope said  Bianca  No no Madam my Lady  Isabella  is of another guess mould than you take her for She used indeed to sigh and lift up her eyes in your company because she knows you are a Saintbut when your back was turnedYou wrong her said  Matilda Isabella  is no hypocrite She has a due sense of devotion but never affected a call she has not On the contrary she always combated my inclination for the cloyster And though I own the mystery she has made to me of her flight confounds me though it seems inconsistent with the friendship between us I cannot forget the disinterested warmth with which she always opposed my taking the veil she  wished to see me married though my dower would have been a loss to her and my brother's children For her sake I will believe well of this young peasant Then you do think there is some liking between them said  Bianca  While she was speaking a servant came hastily into the chamber and told the Princess that the Lady  Isabella  was found Where said  Matilda  She has taken sanctuary in St  Nicholas  's church replied the servant Father  Jerome  has brought the news himself he is below with his Highness Where is my Mother said  Matilda  She is in her own chamber Madam and has asked for you  Manfred  had risen at the first dawn of light and gone to  Hippolita  's apartment to inquire if she knew ought of  Isabella  While he was questioning her word was brought that  Jerome  demanded to speak with him  Manfred  little suspecting the cause of the Friar's arrival and knowing he was employed by  Hippolita  in her charities ordered him to be admitted intending  to leave them together while he pursued his search after  Isabella  Is your business with me or the Princess said  Manfred  With both Replied the holy man The Lady  Isabella  what of her interrupted  Manfred  eagerly is at St  Nicholas  's altar replied  Jerome  That is no business of  Hippolita  said  Manfred  with confusion Let us retire to my chamber Father and inform me how she came thither No my Lord replied the good man with an air of firmness and authority that daunted even the resolute  Manfred  who could not help revering the saintlike virtues of  Jerome  My commission is to both and with your Highness's goodliking in the presence of both I shall deliver itbut first my Lord I must interrogate the Princess whether she is acquainted with the cause of the Lady  Isabella  's retirement from your castleno on my soul said  Hippolita  does  Isabella  charge me with being privy to itFather interrupted  Manfred  I pay due reverence to your holy profession but I am sovereign here  and will allow no meddling priest to interfore in the affairs of my domestic If you have ought to say attend me to my chamberI do not use to let my Wife be acquainted with the secret affairs of my State they are not within a woman's province My Lord said the holy man I am no intruder into the secrets of families My office is to promote peace to heal divisions to preach repentance and teach mankind to curb their headstrong passions I forgive your Highness's uncharitable apostrophe I know my duty and am the minister of a mightier prince than  Manfred  Hearken to him who speaks through my organs  Manfred  trembled with rage and shame  Hippolita  's countenance declared her astonishment and impatience to know where this would end her silence more strongly spoke her observance of  Manfred  The Lady  Isabella  resumed  Jerome  commends herself to both your Highnesses she thanks both for the kindness with which she has been treated in your castle She deplores the loss of your son and her own misfortune in not becoming  the daughter of such wise and noble Princes whom she shall always respect as  Parents  she prays for uninterrupted union and felicity between you  Manfred  's colour changed but as it is no longer possible for her to be allied to you she intreats your consent to remain in sanctuary till she can learn news of her father or by the certainty of his death be at liberty with the approbation of her guardians to dispose of herself in suitable marriage I shall give no such consent said the Prince but insist on her return to the castle without delay I am answerable for her person to her guardians and will not brook her being in any hands but my own Your Highness will recollect whether that can any longer be proper replied the Friar I want no monitor said  Manfred  colouring  Isabella  's conduct leaves room for strange suspicions and that young villain who was at least the accomplice of her flight if not the cause of itthe cause interrupted  Jerome  was a young man the cause This is not to be borne cried  Manfred  Am I to be bearded in my  own palace by an Insolent Monk thou art privy I guess to their amours I would pray to heaven to clear up your uncharitable surmizes said  Jerome  if your Highness were not satisfied in your conscience how unjustly you accuse me I do pray to heaven to pardon that uncharitableness And I implore your Highness to leave the Princess at peace in that holy place where she is not liable to be disturbed by such vain and worldly fantasies as discourses of love from any man Cant not to me said  Manfred  but return and bring the Princess to her duty It is my duty to prevent her return hither said  Jerome  She is where orphans and virgins are safest from the snares and wiles of this world and nothing but a parent's authority shall take her thence I am her parent cried  Manfred  and demand her She wished to have you for her parent said the Friar But heaven that forbad that connection has for ever dissolved all ties betwixt you And I announce to your Highness stop audacious man said  Manfred  and dread my displeasure Holy father said  Hippolita    it is your office to be no respecter of persons you must speak as your duty prescribes But it is my duty to hear nothing that it pleases not my Lord I should hear Attend the Prince to his chamber I will retire to my oratory and pray to the blessed virgin to inspire you with her holy councils and to restore the heart of my gracious Lord to its wonted peace and gentleness Excellent woman said the Friar my Lord I attend your pleasure  Manfred  accompanied by the Friar passed to his own apartment where shutting the door I perceive father said he that  Isabella  has acquainted you with my purpose Now hear my resolve and obey Reasons of state most urgent reasons my own and the safety of my people demand that I should have a son It is in vain to expect an heir from  Hippolita  I have made choice of  Isabella  You must bring her back and you must do more I know the influence you have with  Hippolita  her conscience is in your hands She is I allow a  faultless woman Her soul is set on heaven and scorns the little grandeur of this world you can withdraw her from it intirely Persuade her to consent to the dissolution of our marriage and to retire into a monasteryshe shall endow one if she will and she shall have the means of being as liberal to your order as she or you can wish Thus you will divert the calamities that are hanging over our heads and have the merit of saving the principality of  Otranto  from destruction You are a prudent man and though the warmth of my temper betrayed me into some unbecoming expressions I honour your virtue and wish to be indebted to you for the repose of my life and the preservation of my family  The will of heaven be done said the Friar I am but its worthless instrument It makes use of my tongue to tell thee Prince of thy unwarrantable designs The injuries of the virtuous  Hippolita  have mounted to the throne of pity By me thou art reprimanded for thy  adulterous intention of repudiating her By me thou art warned not to pursue the incestuous design on thy contracted daughter Heaven that delivered her from thy fury when the judgments so recently fallen on thy house ought to have inspired thee with other thoughts will continue to watch over her Even I a poor and despised Friar am able to protect her from thy violence I sinner as I am and uncharitably reviled by your Highness as an accomplice of I know not what amours scorn the allurements with which it has pleased thee to tempt mine honesty I love my order I honour devout souls I respect the piety of thy Princessbut I will not betray the confidence she reposes in me nor serve even the cause of religion by soul and sinful compliancesbut for sooth the welfare of the state depends on your Highness having a son Heaven mocks the shortsighted views of man But yestermorn whose house was so great so flourishing as  Manfred  's where is young  Conrad  nowmy Lord I  respect your tearsbut I mean not to check themlet them slow Prince they will weigh more with heaven towards the welfare of thy subjects than a marriage which founded on lust or policy could never prosper The scepter which passed from the race of  Alfonso  to thine cannot be preserved by a match which the church will never allow If it is the will of the most High that  Manfred  's name must perish resign yourself my Lord to its decrees and thus deserve a crown that can never pass away come my Lord I like this sorrowlet us return to the Princess She is not apprised of your cruel intentions nor did I mean more than to alarm you You saw with what gentle patience with what efforts of love she heard she rejected hearing the extent of your guilt I know she longs to fold you in her arms and assure you of her unalterable affection Father said the Prince you mistake my compunction true I honour  Hippolito  's virtues I think her a Saint and wish it were for my soul's health  to tie faster the knot that has united usbut alas Father you know not the bitterest of my pangs it is some time that I have had scruples on the legality of our union  Hippolita  is related to me in the fourth degreeit is true we had a dispensation But I have been informed that she had also been contracted to another This it is that sits heavy at my heart To this state of unlawful wedlock I impute the visitation that has fallen on me in the death of  Conrad  ease my conscience of this burden dissolve our marriage and accomplish the work of godliness which your divine exhortations have commenced in my soul  How cutting was the anguish which the good man felt when he perceived this turn in the wily Prince He trembled for  Hippolita  whose ruin he saw was determined and he feared if  Manfred  had no hope of recovering  Isabella  that his impatience for a son would direct him to some other object who might not be equally proof against the temptation  of  Manfred  's rank For some time the holy man remained absorbed in thought At length conceiving some hope from delay he thought the wisest conduct would be to prevent the Prince from despairing of recovering  Isabelia  Her the Friar knew he could dispose from her affection to  Hippolita  and from the aversion she had expressed to him for  Manfred  's addresses to second his views till the censures of the church could be fulminated against a divorce With this intention as if struck with the Prince's scruples he at length said my Lord I have been pondering on what your Highness has said and if in truth it is delicacy of conscience that is the real motive of your repugnance to your virtuous Lady far be it from me to endeavour to harden your heart The church is an indulgent mother unfold your griefs to her she alone can administer comfort to your soul either by satisfying your conscience or upon examination of your scruples by setting you at liberty and indulging you in the lawful  means of continuing your lineage In the latter case if the Lady  Isabella  can be brought to consent  Manfred  who concluded that he had either overreached the good man or that his first warmth had been but a tribute paid to appearance was overjoyed at this sudden turn and repeated the most magnificent promises if he should succeed by the Friar's mediation The well meaning Priest suffered him to deceive himself fully determined to traverse his views instead of seconding them  Since we now understand one another resumed the Prince I expect Father that you satisfy me in one point Who is the youth that I found in the vault He must have been privy to  Isabella  's flight Tell me truly is he her lover or is he an agent for another's passion I have often suspected  Isabella  's Indifference to my son a thousand circumstances croud on my mind that confirm that suspicion She herself was so conscious of it that while I discoursed her in the gallery she  outran my suspicions and endeavoured to justify herself from coolness to  Conrad  The Friar who knew nothing of the youth but what he had learnt occasionally from the Princess ignorant what was become of him and not sufficiently reflecting on the impetuosity of  Manfred  's temper conceived that it might not be amiss to sow the seeds of jealousy in his mind they might be turned to some use hereafter either by prejudicing the Prince against  Isabella  if he persisted in that union or by diverting his attention to a wrong scent and employing his thoughts on a visionary intrigue prevent his engaging in any new pursuit With this unhappy policy he answered in a manner to confirm  Manfied  in the belief of some connection between  Isabella  and the youth The Prince whose passions wanted little fuel to throw them into a blaze sell into a rage at the idea of what the Friar suggested I will fathom to the bottom of this intrigue cried he and quitting  Jerome  abruptly with a command  to remain there till his return he hastened to the great hall of the castle and ordered the peasant to be brought before him  Thou hardened young impostor said the Prince as soon as he saw the youth what becomes of thy boasted veracity now it was Providence was it and the light of the moon that discovered the lock of the trapdoor to thee Tell me audacious boy who thou art and how long thou hast been acquainted with the Princessand take care to answer with less equivocation than thou didst last night or tortures shall wring the truth from thee The young man perceiving that his share in the flight of the Princess was discovered and concluding that any thing he should say could no longer be of service or detriment to her replied I am no impostor my Lord nor have I deserved opprobrious language I answered to every question your Highness put to me last night with the same veracity that I shall speak now And that will not be from fear of your  tortures but because my soul abhors a salshood Please to repeat your questions my Lord I am ready to give you all the satisfaction in my power You know my questions replied the Prince and only want time to prepare an evasion Speak directly who art thou and how long hast thou been known to the Princess I am a labourer at the next village said the peasant my name is  Theodore  The Princess found me in the vault last night Before that hour I never was in her presence I may believe as much or as little as I please of this Said  Manfred  but I will hear thy own story before I examine into the truth of it Tell me what reason did the Princess give thee for making her escape thy life depends on thy answer She told me replied  Theodore  that she was on the brink of destruction and that if she could not escape from the castle she was in danger in a few moments of being made miserable for ever And on this slight foundation on a silly girl's report said  Manfred  thou didst hazard my displeasure  I fear no man's displeasure said  Theodore  when a woman in distress puts herself under my protection During this examination  Matilda  was going to the apartment of  Hippolita  At the upper end of the hall where  Manfred  sat was a boarded gallery with latticed windows thro' which  Matilda  and  Bianca  were to pass Hearing her father's voice and seeing the servants assembled round him she stopped to learn the occasion The prisoner soon drew her attention The steady and composed manner in which he answered and the gallantry of his last reply which were the first words she heard distinctly interested her in his favour His person was noble handsome and commanding even in that situation But his countenance soon engrossed her whole care Heaven  Bianca  said the Princess softly do I dream or is not that youth the exact resemblance of  Alfonso  's picture in the gallery She could say no more for her father's voice grew louder at every word This bravado said he surpasses all thy former  insolence Thou shalt experience the wrath with which thou darest to trifle Seize him continued  Manfred  and bind himthe first news the Princess hears of her champion shall be that he has lost his head for her sake The injustice of which thou art guilty towards me said  Theodore  convinces me that I have done a good deed in delivering the Princess from thy tyranny May she be happy whatever becomes of me This is a Lover cried  Manfred  in a rage A peasant within sight of death is not animated by such sentiments Tell me tell me rash boy who thou art or the rack shall force thy secret from thee Thou hast threatened me with death already said the youth for the truth I have told thee If that is all the encouragement I am to expect for sincerity I am not tempted to indulge thy vain curiosity farther Then thou wilt not speak said  Manfred  I will not replied he Bear him away into the courtyard said  Manfred  I will see his head this instant severed  from his body  Matilda  fainted at hearing those words  Bianca  shrieked and cried Help help the Princess is dead  Manfred  started at this ejaculation and demanded what was the matter The young peasant who heard it too was struck with horror and asked eagerly the same question but  Manfred  ordered him to be hurried into the court and kept there for execution till he had informed himself of the cause of  Bianca  's shrieks When he learned the meaning he treated it as a womanish panic and ordering  Matilda  to be carried to her apartment he rushed into the court and calling for one of his guards bad  Theodore  kneel down and prepare to receive the fatal blow  The undaunted youth received the bitter sentence with a resignation that touched every heart but  Manfred  's He wished earnestly to know the meaning of the words he had heard relating to the Princess but fearing to exasperate the tyrant more against her he desisted The only boon he deigned to ask was that he  might be permitted to have a confessor and make his peace with heaven  Manfred  who hoped by the confessor's means to come at the youth's history readily granted his request and being convinced that Father  Jerome  was now in his interest he ordered him to be called and shrieve the prisoner The holy man who had little foreseen the catastrophe that his imprudence occasioned fell on his knees to the Prince and adjured him in the most solemn manner not to shed innocent blood He accused himself in the bitterest terms for his indiscretion endeavoured to disculpate the youth and left no method untried to soften the tyrant's rage  Manfred  more incensed than appeased by  Jerome  's intercession whose retractation now made him suspect he had been imposed upon by both commanded the friar to do his duty telling him he would not allow the prisoner many minutes for confession Nor do I ask many my Lord Said the unhappy young man My sins thank heaven have not been numerous nor  exceed what might be expected at my years Dry your tears good father and let us dispatch This is a bad world nor have I had cause to leave it with regret Oh wretched youth said  Jerome  how canst thou bear the sight of me with patience I am thy murderer it is I have brought this dismal hour upon thee I forgive thee from my soul said the youth as I hope heaven will pardon me Hear my confession father and give me thy blessing How can I prepare thee for thy passage as I ought said  Jerome  Thou canst not be saved without pardoning thy foesand canst thou forgive that impious man there I can said  Theodore  I doAnd does not this touch thee cruel Prince said the Friar I sent for thee to confess him said  Manfred  sternly not to plead for him Thou didst first incense me against him his blood be on thy head It will it will said the good man in an agony of sorrow Thou and I must never hope to go where this blessed youth is going Dispatch said  Manfred  I am no more to be moved by the whining of priests than by the shrieks of women What said the youth is it possible that my fate could have occasioned what I heard is the Princess then again in thy power Thou dost but remember me of thy wrath said  Manfred  Prepare thee for this moment is thy last The youth who felt his indignation rise and who was touched with the sorrow which he saw he had infused into all the spectators as well as into the Friar suppressed his emotions and putting off his doublet and unbuttoning his collar knelt down to his prayers As he stooped his shirt slipped down below his shoulder and discovered the mark of a bloody arrow Gracious heaven cried the holy man starting what do I see it is my child my  Theodore  The passions that ensued must be conceived they cannot be painted The tears of the assistants were suspended by wonder rather than stopped by joy They seemed to inquire in the eyes of their Lord what they ought to feel  Surprise doubt tenderness respect suceeded each other in the countenance of the youth He received with modest submission the effusion of the old man's tears and embraces Yet afraid of giving a loose to hope and suspecting from what had passed the inflexibility of  Manfred  's temper he cast a glance towards the Prince as if to say canst thou be unmoved at such a scene as this  Manfred  's heart was capable of being touched He forgot his anger in his astonishment Yet his pride forbad his owning himself affected He even doubted whether this discovery was not a contrivance of the friar to save the youth What may this mean said he How can he be thy son is it consistent with thy profession or reputed sanctity to avow a peasant's offspring for the fruit of thy irregular amours Oh God said the holy man dost thou question his being mine could I feel the anguish I do if I were not his father Spare him good Prince spare him and revile me as thou pleasest Spare  him spare him cried the attendants for this good man's sake Peace said  Manfred  sternly I must know more ere I am disposed to pardon A Saint's bastard may be no saint himself Injurious Lord said  Theodore  add not insult to cruelty If I am this venerable man's son tho' no Prince as thou art know the blood that flows in my vainsyes said the friar interrupting him his blood is noble nor is he that abject thing my Lord you speak him He is my lawful son and  Sicily  can boast of few houses more ancient than that of  Falconara  but alas my Lord what is blood what is nobility We are all reptiles miserable sinful creatures It is piety alone that can distinguish us from the dust whence we sprung and whither we must returnTruce to your sermon said  Manfred  You forget you are no longer Friar  Jerome  but the Count of  Falconara  Let me know your history You will have time to moralize hereafter if you should not happen to obtain the grace of that sturdy criminal there  Mother of God said the Friar is it possible my Lord can refuse a father the life of his only his longlost child Trample me my Lord scorn afflict me accept my life for his but spare my son Thou canst feel then said  Manfred  what it is to lose an only sona little hour ago thou didst preach up resignation to me  My  House if fate so spleased must perish but the Counts of  Falconara  alas my Lord said  Jerome  I confess I have offended but aggravate not an old man's sufferings I boast not of my family nor think of such vanitiesit is nature that pleads for this boy it is the memory of the dear woman that bore himis she  Theodore  is she deadHer soul has long been with the blessed Said  Theodore  Oh how cried  Jerome  tell meNoshe is happy Thou art all my care nowmost dread Lord will youwill you grant me my poor boy's life Return to thy convent answered  Manfred  conduct the Princess hither obey me in what  thou knowest and I promise thee the life  of thy sonOh my Lord said  Jerome  is my honesty the price I must pay for this dear youth's safetyfor me cried  Theodore  Let me die a thousand deaths rather than stain thy conscience What is it the tyrant would exact of thee is the Princess still safe from his power protect her thou venerable old man and let all the weight of his wrath fall on me  Jerome  endeavoured to check the impetuosity of the youth and ere  Manfred  could reply the trampling of horses was heard and a brazen trumpet which hung without the gate of the castle was suddenly sounded At the same instant the sable plumes on the enchanted helmet which still remained at the other end of the court were tempestuously agitated and nodded thrice as if bowed by some invisible wearer  CHAP III  MANFRED  's heart misgave him when he beheld the plumage on the miraculous casque shaken in concert with the sounding of the brazen trumpet Father said he to  Jerome  whom he now ceased to treat as Count of  Falconara  what mean these portents If I have offended the plumes were shaken with greater violence than before Unhappy Prince that I am cried  Manfred  Holy Father will you not assist me with your prayers My Lord replied  Jerome  heaven is no doubt displeased with your mockery of its servants Submit yourself to the church and cease to persecute her ministers Dismiss this innocent youth and learn to respect the holy character I wear Heaven will not be trifled with you see the trumpet sounded again I acknowledge I  been too hasty said  Manfred  Father  do you go to the wicket and demand who is at the gate Do you grant me the life of  Theodore  replied the Friar I do said  Manfred  but inquire who is without  Jerome  falling on the neck of his son discharged a flood of tears that spoke the fullness of his soul You promised to go to the gate said  Manfred  I thought replied the Friar your Highness would excuse my thanking you first in this tribute of my heart Go dearest Sir said  Theodore  obey the Prince I do not deserve that you should delay his satisfaction for me  Jerome  inquiring who was without was answered a Herald From whom said he From the Knight of the gigantic sabre said the Herald and I must speak with the usurper of  Otranto Jerome  returned to the Prince and did not fail to repeat the message in the very words it had been uttered The first sounds struck  Manfred  with terror but when he heard himself styled usurper his rage rekindled and all his courage revived Usurperinsolent villain cried he who dares to question my title retire  Father this is no business for Monks I will meet this presumptuous man myself Go to your convent and prepare the Princes's return Your Son shall be a hostage for your fidelity His life depends on your obedience Good heaven my Lord cried  Jerome  your Highness did but this instant freely pardon my child have you so soon forgot the interposition of heaven Heaven replied  Manfred  does not send Heralds to question the title of a lawful PrinceI doubt whether it even notifies its will through Friarsbut that is your affair not mine At present you know my pleasure and it is not a saucy Herald that shall save your son if you do not return with the Princess  It was in vain for the holy man to reply  Manfred  commanded him to be conducted to the posterngate and shut out from the castle And he ordered some of his attendants to carry  Theodore  to the top of the black tower and guard him strictly scarce permitting the Father and son to exchange a hasty embrace at parting  He then withdrew to the hall and seating himself in princely state ordered the Herald to be admitted to his presence  Well thou insolent said the Prince what wouldst thou with me I come replied he to thee  Manfred  usurper of the principality of  Otranto  from the renowned and invincible Knight the Knight of the gigantic sabre in the name of his Lord  Freaeric  Marquis of  Vicenza  he demands the Lady  Isabella  daughter of that Prince whom thou hast basely and traiterously got into thy power by bribing her false guardians during his absence and he requires thee to resign the principality of  Otranto  which thou hast usurped from the said Lord  Frederic  the nearest of blood to the last rightful Lord  Alfonso  the good If thou dost not instantly comply with these just demands he defies thee to single combat to the last extremity And so saying the Herald cast down his warder  And where is this braggart who sends thee said  Manfred  At the distance of a league said  the Herald he comes to make good his Lord's claim against thee as he is a true Knight and thou an usurper and ravisher  Injurious as this challenge was  Manfred  reflected that it was not his interest to provoke the Marquis He knew how wellfounded the claim of  Frederic  was nor was this the first time he had heard of it  Frederic  's ancestors had assumed the style of Princes of  Otranto  from the death of  Alfonso  the good without issue but  Manfred  his Father and grandfather had been too powerful for the house of  Vicenza  to dispossess them  Frederic  a martial and amorous young Prince had married a beautiful young Lady of whom he was enamoured and who had died in childbed of  Isabella  Her death affected him so much that he had taken the cross and gone to the holy land where he was wounded in an engagement against the infidels made prisoner and reported to be dead When the news reached  Manfred  's ears he bribed the guardians of the Lady  Isabella  to deliver her up  to him as a bride for his son  Conrad  by which alliance he had proposed to unite the claims of the two houses This motive on  Conrad  's death had cooperated to make him so suddenly resolve on espousing her himself and the same reflection determined him now to endeavour at obtaining the consent of  Frederic  to this marriage A like policy inspired him with the thought of inviting  Frederic  's champion into his castle lest he should be informed of  Isbella  's flight which he strictly enjoined his domestics not to disclose to any of the Knight's retinue  Herald said  Manfred  as soon as he had digested these reflections return to thy master and tell him e'er we liquidate our differences by the sword  Manfred  would hold some converse with him Bid him welcome to my castle where by my faith as I am a true Knight he shall have courteous reception and full security for himself and followers If we cannot adjust our quarrel by amicable means I swear he shall depart in safety and shall have full satisfaction  according to the laws of arms So help me God and his holy Trinity the Herald made three obeissances and retired  During this interview  Jerome  's mind was agitated by a thousand contrary passions He trembled for the life of his son and his first thought was to persuade  Isabella  to return to the castle Yet he was scarce less alarmed at the thought of her union with  Manfred  He dreaded  Hippolita  's unbounded submission to the will of her Lord and though he did not doubt but he could alarm her piety not to consent to a divorce if he could get access to her yet should  Manfred  discover that the obstruction came from him it might be equally fatal to  Theodore  He was impatient to know whence came the Herald who with so little management had questioned the title of  Manfred  yet he did not dare absent himself from the convent lest  Isabella  should leave it and her flight be imputed to him He returned disconsolately to the monastery uncertain on what conduct to resolve A Monk who met  him in the porch and observed his melancholy air said alas brother is it then true that we have lost our excellent Princess  Hippolita  The holy man started and cried what meanest thou brother I come this instant from the castle and left her in perfect health  Martelli  replied the other Friar passed by the convent but a quarter of an Hour ago on his way from the castle and reported that her Highness was dead All our brethren are gone to the chapel to pray for her happy transit to a better life and willed me to wait thy arrival They know thy holy attachment to that good Lady and are anxious for the affliction it will cause in theeindeed we have all reason to weep she was a mother to our Housebut this life is but a pilgrimage we must not murmurwe shall all follow her may our end be like her's good brother thou dreamest said  Jerome  I tell thee I come from the castle and left the Princess wellwhere is the Lady  Isabella  poor Gentlewoman replied the Friar I told her the sad news and  offered her spiritual comfort I reminded her of the transitory condition of mortality and advised her to take the veil I quoted the example of the holy Princess  Sanchia  of  Arragon  thy zeal was laudable said  Jerome  impatiently but at present it was unnecessary  Hippolita  is well at least I trust in the Lord she is I heard nothing to the contraryyet methinks the Prince's earnestnesswell brother but where is the Lady  Isabella  I know not said the Friar She wept much and said she would retire to her chamber  Jerome  left his comrade abruptly and hasted to the Princess but she was not in her chamber He inquired of the domestics of the convent but could learn no news of her He searched in vain throughout the monastery and the church and dispatched messengers round the neighbourhood to get intelligence if she had been seen but to no purpose nothing could equal the good man's perplexity He judged that  Isabella  suspecting  Manfred  of having precipitated his wife's death  had taken the alarm and withdrawn herself to some more secret place of concealment This new flight would probably carry the Prince's fury to the height The report of  Hippolita  's death though it seemed almost incredible increased his consternation and though  Isabella  's escape bespoke her aversion of  Manfred  for a husband  Jerome  could feel no comfort from it while it endangered the life of his son He determined to return to the castle and made several of his brethren accompany him to attest his innocence to  Manfred  and if necessary join their intercession with his for  Theodore  The Prince in the mean time had passed into the court and ordered the gates of the castle to be flung open for the reception of the stranger Knight and his train In a few minutes the cavalcade arrived First came two harbingers with wands Next a herald followed by two pages and two trumpets Then an hundred footguards These were attended by as many horse After them fifty footmen cloathed in  scarlet and black the colours of the Knight Then a led horse Two heralds on each side of a gentleman on horseback bearing a banner with the arms of  Vicenza  and  Otranto  quarterly a circumstance that much offended  Manfred  but he stifled his resentment Two more pages The Knight's confessor telling his beads Fifty more footmen clad as before Two Knights habited in complete armour their beavors down comrades to the principal Knight The squires of the two Knights carrying their shields and devices The Knight's own squire An hundred gentlemen bearing an enormous sword and seeming to faint under the weight of it The Knight himself on a chestnut steed in complete armour his lance in the rest his face entirely concealed by his vizor which was surmounted by a large plume of scarlet and black feathers Fifty footguards with drums and trumpets closed the procession which wheeled off to the right and left to make room for the principal Knight  As soon as he approached the gate he stopped and the herald advancing read again the words of the challenge  Manfred  's eyes were fixed on the gigantic sword and he scarce seemed to attend to the cartel But his attention was soon diverted by a tempest of wind that rose behind him He turned and beheld the plumes of the enchanted helmet agitated in the same extraordinary manner as before It required intrepidity like  Manfred  's not to sink under a concurrence of circumstances that seemed to announce his fate Yet scorning in the presence of strangers to betray the courage he had always manifested he said boldly Sir Knight whoever thou art I bid thee welcome If thou art of mortal mould thy valour shall meet its equal And if thou art a true Knight thou wilt scorn to employ sorcery to carry thy point Be these omens from heaven or hell  Manfred  trusts to the righteousness of his cause and to the aid of St  Nicholas  who has ever protected his house Alight Sir Knight and repose thyself Tomorrow  thou shalt have a fair field and heaven befriend the juster side  The Knight made no reply but dismounting was conducted by  Manfred  to the great hall of the castle As they traversed the court the Knight stopped to gaze at the miraculous casque and kneeling down seemed to pray inwardly for some minutes Rising he made a sign to the Prince to lead on As soon as they entered the hall  Manfred  proposed to the stranger to disarm but the Knight shook his head in token of refusal Sir Knight said  Manfred  this is not courteous but by my good faith I will not cross thee nor shalt thou have cause to complain of the Prince of  Otranto  No treachery is designed on my part I hope none is intended on thine Here take my gage giving him his ring your friends and you shall enjoy the laws of hospitality Rest here until refreshments are brought I will but give orders for the accommodation of your train and return to you The three Knights bowed as accepting his courtesy  Manfred  directed the stranger's retinue to be conducted to an adjacent hospital founded by the Princess  Hippolita  for the reception of pilgrims As they made the circuit of the court to return towards the gate the gigantic sword burst from the supporters and falling to the ground opposite to the helmet remained immoveable  Manfred  almost hardened to preternatural appearances surmounted the shock of this new prodigy and returning to the hall where by this time the feast was ready he invited his silent guests to take their places  Manfred  however ill his heart was at ease endeavoured to inspire the company with mirth He put several questions to them but was answered only by signs They raised their vizors but sufficiently to feed themselves and that sparingly Sirs said the Prince ye are the first guests I ever treated within these walls who scorned to hold any intercourse with me Nor has it oft been customary I ween for Princes to hazard their state and dignity against strangers  and mutes You say you come in the name of  Frederic  of  Vicenza  I have ever heard that he was a gallant and courteous Knight nor would he I am bold to say think it beneath him to mix in social converse with a Prince that is his equal and not unknown by deeds in arms Still ye are silentwell be it as it may by the laws of hospitality and chivalry ye are masters under this roof Ye shall do your pleasures but come give me a goblet of wine ye will not refuse to pledge me to the healths of your fair mistresses The principal Knight sighed and crossed himself and was rising from the boardSir Knight said  Manfred  what I said was but in sport I shall constrain you in nothing Use your good liking Since mirth is not your mood let us be sad Business may hit your fancies better Let us withdraw and hear if what I have to unfold may be better relished than the vain efforts I have made for your pastime  Manfred  then conducting the three Knights into an inner chamber shut the door and inviting them to be seated began thus addressing himself to the chief personage  You come Sir Knight as I understand in the name of the Marquis of  Vicenza  to redemand the Lady  Isabella  his daughter who has been contracted in the face of holy church to my son by the consent of her legal guardians and to require me to resign my dominions to your Lord who gives himself for the nearest of blood to Prince  Alfonso  whose soul God rest I shall speak to the latter article of your demands first You must know your Lord knows that I enjoy the principality of  Otranto  from my father  Don Manuel  as he received it from his father  Don Ricardo Alfonso  their predecessor dying childess in the Holy Land bequeathed his estates to my grandfather  Don Ricardo  in consideration of his faithful servicesthe stranger shook his headSir Knight said  Manfred  warmly  Ricardo  was a valiant and upright  man he was a pious man witness his munificent foundation of the adjoining church and two convents He was peculiarly patronized by St  Nicholas  my grandfather was incapable I say Sir  Don Ricardo  was incapableexcuse me your interruption has disordered me I venerate the memory of my grandfather well Sirs he held this estate he held it by his good sword and by the favour of St  Nicholas  so did my father and so Sirs will I come what come willbut  Frederic  your Lord is nearest in bloodI have consented to put my title to the issue of the sworddoes that imply a vitious titleI might have asked where is  Frederic  your Lord Report speaks him dead in captivity You say your actions say he lives I question it notI might Sirs I mightbut I do not Other Princes would bid  Frederic  take his inheritance by force if he can They would not stake their dignity on a single combat They would not submit it to the decision of unknown mutespardon me Gentlemen  I am too warm But suppose yourselves in my situation As ye are stout Knights would it not move your choler to have your own and the honour of your ancestors called in question but to the point Ye require me to deliver up the Lady  Isabella  Sirs I must ask if ye are authorized to receive her The Knight nodded Receive hercontinued  Manfred  well you are authorized to receive herbut gentle Knight may I ask if you have full powers The Knight nodded 'Tis well Said  Manfred  Then hear what I have to offerye see Gentlemen before you the most unhappy of men he began to weep afford me your compassion I am intitled to it Indeed I am Know I have lost my only hope my joy the support of my house  Conrad  died yester morning The Knights discovered signs of surprise Yes Sirs fate has disposed of my son  Isabella  is at libertyDo you then restore her cried the chief Knight breaking silence Afford me your patience Said  Manfred  I rejoice  to find by this testimony of your goodwill that this matter may be adjusted without blood It is no interest of mine dicates what little I have farther to say Ye behold in me a man disgusted with the world The loss of my son has weaned me from earthly cares Power and greatness have no longer any charms in my eyes I wished to transmit the scepter I had received from my ancestors with honour to my sonbut that is over Life itself is so indifferent to me that I accepted your defiance with joy A good Knight cannot go to the grave with more satisfaction than when falling in his vocation Whatever is the will of heaven I submit for alas Sirs I am a man of many sorrows  Manfred  is no object of envybut no doubt you are acquainted with my story The Knight made signs of ignorance and seemed curious to have  Manfred  proceed Is it possible Sirs continued the Prince that my story should be a secret to you have you heard nothing relating to me and the Princess  Hippolita  They shook their headsno thus then Sirs it is You think me ambitious Ambition alas is composed of more rugged materials If I were ambitious I should not for so many years have been a prey to all the hell of conscientious scruplesbut I weary your patience I will be brief Know then that I have long been troubled in mind on my union with the Princess  Hippolita  Oh Sirs if ye were acquainted with that excellent woman if ye knew that I adore her like a mistress and cherish her as a friendbut man was not born for perfect happiness she shares my scruples and with her consent I have brought this matter before the church for we are related within the forbidden degrees I expect every hour the definitive sentence that must separate us for ever I am sure you feel for meI see you do pardon these tears The Knights gazed on each other wondering where this would end  Manfred  continued The death of my son betiding while my soul was under this anxiety I thought  of nothing but resigning my dominions and retiring for ever from the sight of mankind My only difficulty was to fix on a successor who would be tender of my people and to dispose of the Lady  Isabella  who is dear to me as my own blood I was willing to restore the line of  Alfonso  even in his most distant kindred And though pardon me I am satisfied it was his will that  Ricardo  's lineage should take place of his own relations yet where was I to search for those relations I knew of none but  Frederic  your Lord he was a captive to the infidels or dead and were he living and at home would he quit the flourishing state of  Vicenza  for the inconsiderable principality of  Otranto  If he would not could I bear the thought of seeing a hard unfeeling Viceroy set over my poor faithful peoplefor Sirs I love my people and thank heaven am beloved by thembut ye will ask whither tends this long discourse briefly then thus Sirs Heaven in your arrival seems to point out a remedy for these difficulties and my misfortunes The Lady  Isabella  is at liberty I shall soon  be soI would submit to any thing for the good of my peoplewere it not the best the only way to extinguish the feuds between our families if I was to take the Lady  Isabella  to wife you startbut though  Hippolita  's virtues will ever be dear to me a Prince must not consider himself he is born for his peopleA servant at that instant entering the chamber apprized  Manfred  that  Jerome  and several of his brethren demanded immediate access to him  The Prince provoked at this interruption and fearing that the Friar would discover to the strangers that  Isabella  had taken sanctuary was going to forbid  Jerome  's entrance But recollecting that he was certainly arrived to notify the Princess's return  Manfred  began to excuse himself to the Knights for leaving them for a few moments but was prevented by the arrival of the Friars  Manfred  angrily reprimanded them for their intrusion and would have forced them back from the chamber but  Jerome  was too much agitated to be repulsed He declared aloud  the flight of  Isabella  with protestations of his own innocence  Manfred  distracted at the news and not less at its coming to the knowledge of the strangers uttered nothing but incoherent sentences now upbraiding the Friar now apologizing to the Knights earnest to know what was become of  Isabella  yet equally afraid of their knowing impatient to pursue her yet dreading to have them join in the pursuit He offered to dispatch messengers in quest of herbut the chief Knight no longer keeping silence reproached  Manfred  in bitter terms for his dark and ambiguous dealing and demanded the cause of  Isabella  's first absence from the castle  Manfred  casting a stern look at  Jerome  implying a command of silence pretended that on  Conrad  's death he had placed her in sanctuary until he could determine how to dispose of her  Jerome  who trembled for his son's life did not dare contradict this falshood but one of his brethren not under the same anxiety declared frankly that she had fled to their church in the preceding  night The Prince in vain endeavoured to stop this discovery which overwhelmed him with shame and confusion The principal stranger amazed at the contradictions he heard and more than half persuaded that  Manfred  had secreted the Princess notwithstanding the concern he expressed at her flight rushing to the door said thou traitorPrince  Isabella  shall be found  Manfred  endeavoured to hold him but the other Knights assisting their comrade he broke from the Prince and hastened into the court demanding his attendants  Manfred  finding it vain to divert him from the pursuit offered to accompany him and summoning his attendants and taking  Jerome  and some of the Friars to guide them they issued from the castle  Manfred  privately giving orders to have the Knight's company secured while to the Knight he affected to dispatch a messenger to require their assistance  The company had no sooner quitted the castle than  Matilda  who felt herself deeply interested  for the young peasant since she had seen him condemned to death in the hall and whose thoughts had been taken up with concerting measures to save him was informed by some of the female attendants that  Manfred  had dispatched all his men various ways in pursuit of  Isabella  He had in his hurry given this order in general terms not meaning to extend it to the guard he had set upon  Theodore  but forgetting it The domestics officious to obey so peremptory a Prince and urged by their own curiosity and love of novelty to join in any precipitate chace had to a man left the castle  Matilda  disengaging herself from her women stole up to the black tower and unbolting the door presented herself to the astonished  Theodore  Young man said she though filial duty and womanly modesty condemn the step I am taking yet holy charity surmounting all other ties justifies this act Fly the doors of thy prison are open My father and his domestics are absent but they may soon return Be gone  in safety and may the angels of heaven direct thy course Thou art surely one of those angels said the enraptured  Theodore  None but a blessed saint could speak could actcould lock like theemay I not know the name of my divine protectress methought thou namedst thy father Is it possible can  Manfred  's blood feel holy pitylovely lady thou answerest notbut how art thou here thyself why dost thou neglect thy own safety and waste a thought on a wretch like  Theodore  let us fly together The life thou bestowest shall be dedicated to thy defence Alas thou mistakest said  Matilda  sighing I am  Manfred  's daughter but no dangers await me Amazement said  Theodore  But last night I blessed myself for yielding thee the service thy gracious compassion so charitably returns me now Still thou art in an error said the Princess but this is no time for explanation Fly virtuous youth while it is in my power to save thee Should my father return thou and I both should indeed have  cause to tremble How said  Theodore  thinkest thou charming maid that I will accept of life at the hazard of aught calamitous to thee better I endured a thousand deaths I run no risk said  Matilda  but by thy delay Depart it cannot be known that I assisted thy flight Swear by the saints above said  Theodore  that thou canst not be suspected else here I vow to await whatever can befal me Oh thou art too generous said  Matilda  but rest assured that no suspicion can alight on me Give me thy beauteous hand in token that thou dost not deceive me said  Theodore  and let me bathe it with the warm tears of gratitude forbear said the Princess this must not be Alas said  Theodore  I have never known but calamity until this hourperhaps shall never know other fortune again Suffer the chaste raptures of holy gratitude 'Tis my soul would print its effusions on thy hand Forbear and be gone Said  Matilda  How would  Isabella  approve of seeing thee at my feet Who is  Isabella  said the young man with surprize Ah me I fear said the Princess I am serving a deceitful onehast thou forgot thy curiosity this morning Thy looks thy actions all thy beauteous self seems an emanation of divinity said  Theodore  but thy words are dark and mysterious speak lady speak to thy servant's comprehensionThou understandest but too well said  Matilda  But once more I command thee to be gone Thy blood which I may preserve will be on my head if I waste the time in vain discourse I go lady said  Theodore  because it is thy will and because I would not bring the grey hairs of my father with sorrow to the grave Say but adored lady that I have thy gentle pityStay said  Matilda  I will conduct thee to the subterraneous vault by which  Isabella  escaped it will lead thee to the church of St  Nicholas  where thou mayst take sanctuaryWhat said  Theodore  was it another and not thy lovely self that I assisted to find the subterraneous passage It was  said  Matilda  but ask no more I tremble to see thee still abide here Fly to the sanctuary to sanctuary said  Theodore  No Princess sanctuaries are for helpless damsels or for criminals  Theodore  's soul is free from guilt nor will wear the appearance of it Give me a sword lady and thy father shall learn that  Theodore  scorns an ignominious flight Rash youth said  Matilda  thou wouldst not dare to lift thy presumptuous arm against the Prince of  Otranto  Not against thy father indeed I dare not said  Theodore  Excuse me lady I had forgottenbut could I gaze on thee and remember thou art sprung from the tyrant  Manfred  but he is thy father and from this moment my injuries are buried in oblivion A deep and hollow groan which seemed to come from above startled the Princess and  Theodore  Good heaven we are overheard said the Princess They listened but perceiving no farther noise they both concluded it the effect of pentup vapours And the Princess  preceding  Theodore  softly carried him to her father's armory where equipping him with a complete suit he was conducted by  Matilda  to the posterngate Avoid the town said the Princess and all the western side of the castle 'Tis there the search must be making by  Manfred  and the strangers But hie thee to the opposite quarter Yonder behind that forest to the east is a chain of rocks hollowed into a labyrinth of caverns that reach to the seacoast There thou mayst lie concealed till thou canst make signs to some vessel to put on shore and take thee off Go heaven be thy guide and sometimes in thy prayers remember  Matilda Theodore  flung himself at her feet and seizing her lilly hand which with struggles she suffered him to kiss he vowed on the earliest opportunity to get himself knighted and fervently intreated her permission to swear himself eternally her knightE'er the Princess could reply a clap of thunder was suddenly heard that shook the battlements  Theodore  regardless  of the tempest would have urged his suit but the Princess dismayed retreated hastily into the castle and commanded the youth to be gone with an air that would not be disobeyed He sighed and retired but with eyes fixed on the gate until  Matilda  closing it put an end to an interview in which the hearts of both had drunk so deeply of a passion which both now tasted for the first time  Theodore  went pensively to the convent to acquaint his father with his deliverance There he learned the absence of  Jerome  and the pursuit that was making after the lady  Isabella  with some particulars of whose story he now first became acquainted The generous galantry of his nature prompted him to wish to assist her but the Monks could lend him no lights to guess at the route she had taken He was not tempted to wander far in search of her for the idea of  Matilda  had imprinted itself so strongly on his heart that he could not bear to absent himself at much distance from her abode The  tenderness  Jerome  had expressed for him concurred to confirm this reluctance and he even persuaded himself that silial affection was the chief cause of his hovering between the castle and monastery Until  Jerome  should return at night  Theodore  at length determined to repair to the forest that  Matilda  had pointed out to him Arriving there he sought the gloomiest shades as best suited to the pleasing melancholy that reigned in his mind In this mood he roved insensibly to the caves which had formerly served as a retreat to hermits and were now reported round the country to be haunted by evil spirits He recollected to have heard this tradition and being of a brave and adventurous disposition he willingly indulged his curiosity in exploring the secret recesses of this labyrinth He had not penetrated far before he thought he heard the steps of some person who seemed to retreat before him  Theodore  though firmly grounded in all our holy faith enjoins to be believed had no apprehension  that good men were abandoned without cause to the malice of the powers of darkness He thought the place more likely to be infested by robbers than by those infernal agents who are reported to molest and bewilder travellers He had long burned with impatience to approve his valourdrawing his sabre he marched sedately onwards still directing his steps as the imperfect rustling sound before him led the way The armour he wore was a like indication to the person who avoided him  Theodore  now convinced that he was not mistaken redoubled his pace and evidently gained on the person that fled whose haste increasing  Theodore  came up just as a woman fell breathless before him He hasted to raise her but her terror was so great that he apprehended she would saint in his arms He used every gentle word to dispel her alarms and assured her that far from injuring he would defend her at the peril of his life The lady recovering her spirits from his courteous demeanour and gazing on her protector  COOKE'S POCKET EDITION OF SELECT NOVELS  CASTLE OF OTRANTO  Theodore conducting Isabella to the Cavern to protect her from the fury of Manfred  said sure I have heard that voice before not to my knowledge replied  Theodore  unless as I conjecture thou art the lady  Isabella  merciful heaven cried she thou art not sent in quest of me art thou and saying those words she threw herself at his feet and besought him not to deliver her up to  Manfred  To  Manfred  cried  Theodore  no lady I have once already delivered thee from his tyranny and it shall fare hard with me now but I will place thee out of the reach of his daring Is it possible said she that thou shouldst be the generous unknown whom I met last night in the vault of the castle sure thou art not a mortal but my guardian angel On my knees let me thankhold gentle Princess said  Theodore  nor demean thyself before a poor and friendless young man If heaven has selected me for thy deliverer it will accomplish its work and strengthen my arm in thy causebut come lady we are too near the mouth of the cavern let us seek its inmost recesses I  can have no tranquillity till I have placed thee beyond the reach of danger Alas what mean you Sir said she Though all your actions are noble though your sentiments speak the purity of your soul is it fitting that I should accompany you alone into these perplexed retreats should we be found together what would a censorious world think of my conduct I respect your virtuous delicacy said  Theodore  nor do you harbour a suspicion that wounds my honour I meant to conduct you into the most private cavity of these rocks and then at the hazard of my life to guard their entrance against every living thing Besides lady continued he drawing a deep sigh beauteous and all perfect as your form is and though my wishes are not guiltless of aspiring know my soul is dedicated to another and although a sudden noise prevented  Theodore  from proceeding They soon distinguished these sounds  Isabella  what ho  Isabella  the trembling Princess relapsed into her former  agony of fear  Theodore  endeavoured to encourage her but in vain He assured her he would die rather than suffer her to return under  Manfred  's power and begging her to remain concealed he went forth to prevent the person in search of her from approaching  At the mouth of the cavern he found an armed Knight discoursing with a peasant who assured him he had seen a lady enter the passes of the rock The Knight was preparing to seek her when  Theodore  placing himself in his way with his sword drawn sternly forbad him at his peril to advance And who art thou who darest to cross my way said the Knight haughtily One who does not dare more than he will perform said  Theodore  I seek the lady  Isabella  said the Knight and understand she has taken refuge among these rocks Impede me not or thou wilt repent having provoked my resentment Thy purpose is as odious as thy resentment is contemptible said  Theodore  Return whence thou  camest or we shall soon know whose resentment is most terrible The stranger who was the principal Knight that had arrived from the marquis of  Vicenza  had galloped from  Manfred  as he was busied in getting information of the Princess and giving various orders to prevent her falling into the power of the three Knights Their chief had suspected  Manfred  of being privy to the Princess's absconding and this insult from a man who he concluded was stationed by that Prince to secrete her confirming his suspicions he made no reply but discharging a blow with his sabre at  Theodore  would soon have removed all obstruction if  Theodore  who took him for one of  Manfred  's captains and who had no sooner given the provocation than prepared to support it had not received the stroke on his shield The valour that had so long been smothered in his breast broke forth at once he rushed impetuously on the Knight whose pride and wrath were not less powerful incentives to hardy deeds The combat was  furious but not long  Theodore  wounded the Knight in three several places and at last disarmed him as he fainted with the loss of blood The peasant who had fled at the first onset had given the alarm to some of  Manfred  's domestics who by his orders were dispersed through the forest in pursuit of  Isabella  They came up as the Knight fell whom they soon discovered to be the noble stranger  Theodore  notwithstanding his hatred to  Manfred  could not behold the victory he had gained without emotions of pity and generosity But he was more touched when he learned the quality of his adversary and was informed that he was no retainer but an enemy of  Manfred  He assisted the servants of the latter in disarming the Knight and in endeavouring to staunch the blood that flowed from his wounds The Knight recovering his speech said in a faint and saltering voice generous foe we have both been in an error I took thee for an instrument of the tyrant I perceive thou hast made  the like mistakeit is too late for excusesI faintif  Isabella  is at handcall herI have important secrets toHe is dying said one of the attendants has nobody a crucisix about them  Andrea  do thou pray over himfetch some water said  Theodore  and pour it down his throat while I hasten to the Princesssaying this he flew to  Isabella  and in few words told her modestly that he had been so unfortu+nate by mistake as to wound a gentleman from her father's court who wished e'er he died to impart something of consequence to her The Princess who had been transported at hearing the voice of  Theodore  as he called to her to come forth was astonished at what she heard Suffering herself to be conducted by  Theodore  the new proof of whose valour recalled her dispersed spirits she came where the bleeding Knight lay speechless on the groundbut her fears returned when she beheld the domestics of  Manfred  She would again have fled if  Theodore  had not made her observe that they were unarmed  and had not threatened them with instant death if they should dare to seize the Princess The stranger opening his eyes and beholding a woman saidart thoupray tell me truly art thou  Isabella  of  Vicenza  I am said she good heaven restore theeThen thou then thousaid the Knight struggling for utteranceseestthy fathergive me one oh amasement horror what do I hear what do I see cried  Isabella  My father you my father how came you here Sir for heaven's sake speakoh run for help or he will expire'Tis most true said the wounded Knight exerting all his force I am  Frederic  thy fatheryes I came to deliver thee It will not begive me a parting kiss and takeSir said  Theodore  do not exhaust yourself suffer us to convey you to the castle to the castle said  Isabella  is there no help nearer than the castle would you expose my father to the tyrant if he goes thither I dare not accompany himand yet can I  leave him my child said  Frederic  it matters not for me whither I am carried A few minutes will place me beyond dangerbut while I have eyes to doat on thee forsake me not dear  Isabella  This brave KnightI know not who he is will protect thy innocenceSir you will not abandon my child will you  Theodore  shedding tears over his victim and vowing to guard the Princess at the expence of his life persuaded  Frederic  to suffer himself to be conducted to the castle They placed him on a horse belonging to one of the domestics after binding up his wounds as well as they were able  Theodore  marched by his side and the afflicted  Isabella  who could not bear to quit him followed mournfully behind  CHAP IV  THE sorrowful troop no sooner arrived at the castle than they were met by  Hippolita  and  Matilda  whom  Isabella  had sent one of the domestics before to advertise of their approach The Ladies causing  Frederic  to be conveyed into the nearest chamber retired while the surgeons examined his wounds  Matilda  blushed at seeing  Theodore  and  Isabella  together but endeavoured to conceal it by embracing the latter and condoling with her on her father's mischance The surgeons soon came to acquaint  Hippolita  that none of the Marquis's wounds were dangerous and that he was desirous of seeing his daughter and the Princesses  Theodore  under pretence of expressing his joy at being freed from his apprehensions of the combat being fatal to  Frederic  could not resist the  impulse of following  Matilda  Her eyes were so often cast down on meeting his that  Isabella  who regarded  Theodore  as attentively as he gazed on  Matilda  soon devined who the object was that he had told her in the cave engaged his affections While this mute scene passed  Hippolita  demanded of  Frederic  the cause of his having taken that mysterious course for reclaiming his daughter and threw in various apologies to excuse her Lord for the match contracted between their children  Frederic  however incensed against  Manfred  was not insensible to the courtesy and benevolence of  Hippolita  But he was still more struck with the lovely form of  Matilda  Wishing to detain them by his bedside he informed  Hippolita  of his story He told her that while prisoner to the infidels he had dreamed that his daughter of whom he had learned no news since his captivity was detained in a castle where she was in danger of the most dreadful misfortunes And that if he obtained his liberty and repaired to a wood  near  Joppa  he would learn more Alarmed at this dream and incapable of obeying the direction given by it his chains became more grievous than ever But while his thoughts were occupied on the means of obtaining his liberty he received the agreeable news that the confederate Princes who were warring in  Palestine  had paid his ransom He instantly set out for the wood that had been marked in his dream For three days he and his attendants had wandered in the forest without seeing a human form But on the evening of the third they came to a cell in which they found a venerable hermit in the agonies of death Applying rich cordials they brought the saintlike man to his speech My sons said he I am bounden to your charitybut it is in vainI am going to my eternal restyet I die with the satisfaction of performing the will of heaven When first I repaired to this solitude after seeing my country become a prey to unbelievers it is alas above fifty years since I was witness  to that dreadful scene St  Nicholas  appeared to me and revealed a secret which he bad me never reveal to mortal man but on my deathbed This is that tremendous hour and ye are no doubt the chosen warriors to whom I was ordered to reveal my trust As soon as ye have done the last offices to this wretched corse dig under the seventh tree on the lefthand of this poor cave and your pains willOh good heaven receive my soul With those words the devout man breathed his last By break of day continued  Frederic  when we had committed the holy relicks to earth we dug according to directionbut what was our astonishment when about the depth of six feet we discovered an enormous sabrethe very weapon yonder in the court On the blade which was then partly out of the scabbard though since closed by our efforts in removing it were written the following linesno excuse me Madam added the Marquis turning to  Hippolita  if I forbear to repeat them I respect your sex and  rank and would not be guilty of offending your ear with sounds injurious to ought that is dear to youHe paused  Hippolita  trembled She did not doubt but  Frederic  was destined by heaven to accomplish the sate that seemed to threaten her house Looking with anxious fondness at  Matilda  a silent tear stole down her cheek But recollecting herself she said proceed my Lord Heaven does nothing in vain Mortals must receive its divine behests with lowliness and submission It is our part to deprecate its wrath or bow to its decrees Repeat the sentence my Lord we listen resigned  Frederic  was grieved that he had proceeded so far The dignity and patient firmness of  Hippolita  penetrated him with respect and the tender silent affection with which the Princess and her daughter regarded each other melted him almost to tears Yet apprehensive that his forbearance to obey would be more alarming he repeated in a faltering and low voice the following lines  Where e'er a casque that suits this sword is found  With perils is thy daughter compass'd round  Alfonso  's blood alone can save the maid  And quiet a long restless Prince's shade  What is there in these lines said  Theodore  impatiently that affects these Princesses why were they to be shocked by a mysterious delicacy that has so little foundation Your words are rude young man said the Marquis and tho' fortune has favoured you oncemy honoured Lord said  Isabella  who resented  Theodore  's warmth which she perceived was dictated by his sentiments for  Matilda  discompose not yourself for the glosing of a peasant's son He forgets the reverence he owes you but he is not accustomed  Hippolita  concerned at the heat that had arisen checked  Theodore  for his boldness but with an air acknowledging his zeal and changing the conversation demanded of  Frederic  where he had left her Lord As the Marquis was going to reply they heard a noise  without and rising to inquire the cause  Manfred    Jerome  and part of the troop who had met an imperfect rumour of what had happened entered the chamber  Manfred  advanced hastily towards  Frederic  's bed to condole with him on his misfortune and to learn the circumstances of the combat when starting in an agony of terror and amazement he cried Ha what art thou thou dreadful spectre is my hour come my dearest gracious Lord cried  Hippolita  clasping him in her arms what is it you see why do you fix your eyeballs thusWhat cried  Manfred  breathlessdost thou see nothing  Hippolita  is this ghastly phantom sent to me aloneto me who did notfor mercy's sweetest self my Lord said  Hippolita  resume your soul command your reason There is none here but us your friendswhat is not that  Alfonso  cried  Manfred‚ñ™  Dost thou not see him can it be my brain's deliriumThis my Lord said  Hippolita  this is  Theodore  the youth who has been so unfortunate  Theodore  said  Manfred  mournfully and striking his forehead  Theodore  or a phantom he has unhinged the soul of  Manfred  but how comes he here and how comes he in armour I believe he went in search of  Isabella  Said  Hippolita  Of  Isabella  said  Manfred  relapsing into rageyes yes that is not doubtfulbut how did he escape from durance in which I left him was it  Isabella  or this hypocritical old Friar that procured his enlargementand would a parent be criminal my Lord said  Theodore  if he meditated the deliverance of his child  Jerome  amazed to hear himself in a manner accused by his son and without foundation knew not what to think He could not comprehend how  Theodore  had escaped how he came to be armed and to encounter  Frederic  Still he would not venture to ask any questions that might tend to inflame  Manfred  's wrath against his son  Jerome  's silence convinced  Manfred  that he had contrived  Theodore  's releaseand is it thus thou ungrateful old man said the Prince  addressing himself to the Friar that thou repayest mine and  Hippolita  's bounties And not content with traversing my heart's nearest wishes thou armest thy bastard and bringest him into my own castle to insult me My Lord said  Theodore  you wrong my father Nor he nor I are capable of harbouring a thought against your peace Is it insolence thus to surrender myself to your Highness's pleasure added he laying his sword respectfully at  Manfred  's feet Behold my bosom strike my Lord if you suspect that a disloyal thought is lodged there There is not a sentiment engraven on my heart that does not venerate you and yours The grace and fervour with which  Theodore  uttered these words interested every person present in his favour Even  Manfred  was touched yet still possessed with his resemblance to  Alfonso  his admiration was dashed with secret horror Rise said he thy life is not my present purposeBut tell me thy history and how thou camest connected with this old traitor here  My Lord said  Jerome  eagerlypeace impostor said  Manfred  I will not have him prompted My Lord said  Theodore  I want no assistance My story is very brief I was carried at five years of age to  Algiers  with my mother who had been taken by corsairs from the coast of  Sicily  She died of grief in less than a twelvemonththe tears gushed from  Jerome  's eyes on whose countenance a thousand anxious passions stood expressed Before she died continued  Theodore  she bound a writing about my arm under my garments which told me I was the son of the Count  Falconara  it is most true said  Jerome  I am that wretched fatheragain I enjoin thee silence said  Manfred  Proceed I remained in slavery said  Theodore  until within these two years when attending on my master in his cruizes I was delivered by a Christian vessel which overpowered the pirate and discovering myself to the captian he generously put me on shore in  Sicily  but alas instead of finding a father I learned that his estate  which was situated on the coast had during his absence been laid waste by the Rover who had carried my mother and me into captivity That his castle had been burnt to the ground and that my father on his return had sold what remained and was retired into religion in the kingdom of  Naples  but where no man could inform me Destitute and friendless hopless almost of attaining the transport of a parent's embrace I took the first opportunity of setting sail for  Naples  from whence within these six days I wandered into this province still supporting myself by the labour of my hands nor until yestermorn did I believe that heaven had reserved any lot for me but peace of mind and contented poverty This my Lord is  Theodore  's story I am blessed beyond my hope in finding a father I am unfortunate beyond my desert in having incurred your Highness's displeasure He ceased A murmur of approbation gently arose from the audience This is not all said  Frederic  I am bound in honour  to add what he suppresses Though he is modest I must be generoushe is one of the bravest youths on Christian ground He is warm too and from the short knowledge I have of him I will pledge myself for his veracity If what he reports of himself were not true he would not utter itand for me youth I honour a frankness which becomes thy birth But now and thou didst offend me Yet the noble blood which flows in thy vains may well be allowed to boil out when it has so recently traced itself to its source Come my Lord turning to  Manfred  if I can pardon him surely you may It is not the youth's fault if you took him for a spectre This bitter taunt galled the soul of  Manfred  If beings from another world replied he haughtily have power to impress my mind with awe it is more than living man can do nor could a stripling's arm my Lord interrupted  Hippolita  your guest has occasion for repose Shall we not leave him to his rest Saying this and taking  Manfred  by  the hand she took leave of  Frederic  and led the company forth The Prince not sorry to quit a conversation which recalled to mind the discovery he had made of his most secret sensations suffered himself to be conducted to his own apartment after permitting  Theodore  tho' under engagement to return to the castle on the morrow a condition the young man gladly accepted to retire with his father to the convent  Matilda  and  Isabella  were too much occupied with their own reflections and too little content with each other to wish for farther converse that night They separated each to her chamber with more expressions of ceremony and fewer of affection than had passed between them since their childhood  If they parted with small cordiality they did but meet with greater impatience as soon as the sun was risen Their minds were in a situation that excluded sleep and each recollected a thousand questions which she wished she had put to the other overnight  Matilda  reflected that  Isabella  had been twice delivered by  Theodore  in very critical situations which she could not believe accidental His eyes it was true had been fixed on her in  Frederic  's chamber but that might have been to disguise his passion for  Isabella  from the fathers of both It were better to clear this upShe wished to know the truth lest she should wrong her friend by entertaining a passion for  Isabella  's lover Thus jealousy prompted and at the same time borrowed an excuse from friendship to justify its curiosity  Isabella  not less restless had better foundation for her suspicions Both  Theodore  's tongue and eyes had told her his heart was engaged it was trueyet perhaps  Matilda  might not correspond to his passionshe had ever appeared insensible to love All her thoughts were set on heavenwhy did I dissuade her said  Isabella  to herself I am punished for my generosity but when did they meet whereit cannot be I have deceived myselfperhaps last night was the first time they ever beheld each other  it must be some other object that has prepossessed his affectionsif it is I am not so unhappy as I thought if it is not my friend  Matilda  how can I stoop to wish for the affection of a man who rudely and unnecessarily acquainted me with his indifference and that at the very moment in which common courtesy demanded at least expressions of civility I will go to my dear  Matilda  who will confirm me in this becoming prideman is falseI will advise with her on taking the veil She will rejoice to find me in this disposition and I will acquaint her that I no longer oppose her inclination for the cloyster In this frame of mind and determined to open her heart entirely to  Matilda  she went to that Princess's chamber whom she found already dresled and leaning pensively on her arm This attitude so correspondent to what she felt herself revived  Isabella  's suspicions and destroyed the confidence she had purposed to place in her friend They blushed at meeting and were too much novices  to disguise their sensations with address After some unmeaning questions and replies  Matilda  demanded of  Isabella  the cause of her flight the latter who had almost forgotten  Manfred  's passion so entirely was she occupied by her own concluding that  Matilda  referred to her last escape from the convent which had occasioned the events of the preceding evening replied  Martelli  brought word to the convent that your mother was deadoh said  Matilda  interrupting her  Bianca  has explained that mistake to me on seeing me faint she cried out the Princess is dead and  Martelli  who had come for the usual dole to the castleand what made you faint said  Isabella  indifferent to the rest  Matilda  blushed and stammeredmy father he was sitting in judgment on a criminal what criminal said  Isabella  eagerlya young man said  Matilda  I believeI think it was that young man thatwhat  Theodore  said  Isabella  Yes answered she I never saw him before I do not know how he had offended my father  but as he has been of service to you I am glad my Lord has pardoned himserved me replied  Isabella  do you term it serving me to wound my father and almost occasion his death Though it is but since yesterday that I am blessed with knowing a parent I hope  Matilda  does not think I am such a stranger to filial tenderness as not to resent the boldness of that audacious youth and that it is impossible for me ever to feel any affection for one who dared to lift his arm against the author of my being No  Matilda  my heart abhors him and if you still retain the friendship for me that you have vowed from your infancy you will detest a man who has been on the point of making me miserable for ever  Matilda  held down her head and replied I hope my dearest  Isabella  does not doubt her  Matilda  's friendship I never beheld that youth until yesterday he is almost a stranger to me But as the surgeons have pronounced your father out of danger you ought not to harbour uncharitable resentment  against one who I am persuaded did not know the Marquis was related to you You plead his cause very pathetically said  Isabella  considering he is so much a stranger to you I am mistaken or he returns your charity What mean you said  Matilda  Nothing Said  Isabella  repenting that she had given  Matilda  a hint of  Theodore  's inclination for her Then changing the discourse she asked  Matilda  what occasioned  Manfred  to take  Theodore  for a spectre Bless me said  Matilda  did not you observe his extreme resemblance to the portrait of  Alfonso  in the gallery I took notice of it to  Bianca  even before I saw him in armour but with the helmet on he is the very image of that picture I do not much observe pictures said  Isabella  Much less have I examined this young man so attentively as you seem to have doneah  Matilda  your heart is in dangerbut let me warn you as a friendhe has owned to me that he is in love it cannot be with you for yesterday was the first time you ever metwas  it not certainly replied  Matilda  but why does my dearest  Isabella  conclude from any thing I have said thatshe pausedthen continuing he saw you first and I am far from having the vanity to thing that my little portion of charms could engage a heart devoted to youmay you be happy  Isabella  whatever is the fate of  Matilda  My lovely friend said  Isabella  whose heart was too honest to resist a kind expression it is you that  Theodore  admires I saw it I am persuaded of it nor shall a thought of my own happiness suffer me to interfere with yours This frankness drew tears from the gentle  Matilda  and jealousy that for a moment had raised a coolness between these amiable maidens soon gave way to the natural sincerity and candour of their souls Each confessed to the other the impression that  Theodore  had made on her and this confidence was followed by a struggle of generosity each insisting on yielding her claim to her friend At length the dignity of  Isabella  's virtue reminding her of the preference which  Theodore  had almost declared for her rival made her determine to conquer her passion and cede the beloved object to her friend  During this contest of amity  Hippolita  entered her daughter's chamber Madam said she to  Isabella  you have so much tenderness for  Matilda  and interest yourself so kindly in whatever affects our wretched house that I can have no secrets with my child which are not proper for you to hear The Princesses were all attention and anxiety Know then Madam continued  Hippolita  and you my dearest  Matilda  that being convinced by all the events of these two last ominous days that heaven purposes the sceptre of  Otranto  shuld pass from  Manfred  's hands into those of the Marquis  Frederic  I have been perhaps inspired with the thought of averting our total destruction by the union of our rival houses With this view I have been proposing to  Manfred  my Lord to tender this dear dear child to  Frederic  your father me to lord  Frederic  cried  Matilda  good heavens  my gracious motherand have you named it to my father I have Said  Hippolita  He listened benignly to my proposal and is gone to break it to the Marquis Ah wretched Princess cried  Isabella  what hast thou done what ruin has thy inadvertent goodness been preparing for thyself for me and for  Matilda  Ruin from me to you and to my child said  Hippolita  what can this mean Alas said  Isabella  the purity of your own heart prevents your seeing the depravity of others  Manfred  your Lord that impious manhold said  Hippolita  you must not in my presence young lady mention  Manfred  with disrespect He is my lord and husband andwill not long be so said  Isabella  if his wicked purposes can be carried into execution This language amazes me said  Hippolita  Your feeling  Isabella  is warm but until this hour I never knew it betray you into intemperance What deed of  Manfred  authorizes you to treat him as a murderer an assassin Thou virtuous and too credulous Princess  replied  Isabella  it is not thy life he aims atit is to separate himself from thee to divorce thee toto divorce me to divorce my mother cried  Hippolita  and  Matilda  at once yes said  Isabella  and to compleat his crime he meditatesI cannot speak it What can surpass what thou hast already uttered said  Matilda Hippolita  was silent Grief choaked her speech and the recollection of  Manfred  's late ambiguous discourses confirmed what she heard Excellent dear Lady Madam Mother cried  Isabella  flinging herself at  Hippolita  's feet in a transport of passion trust me believe me I will die a thousand deaths sooner than consent to injure you than yield to so odious ohThis is too much cried  Hippolita  What crimes does one crime suggest rise dear  Isabella  I do not doubt your virtue Oh  Matilda  this stroke is too heavy for thee weep not my child and not a murmur I charge thee Remember he is  thy  father stillbut you are my mother too said  Matilda  servently  and  you  are virtuous  you  are guiltlessOh must not I must not I complain You must not Said  Hippolita  come all will yet be well  Manfred  in the agony for the loss of thy brother knew not what he said perhaps  Isabella  misunderstood him His heart is goodand my child thou knowest not all There is a destiny hangs over us the hand of Providence is stretched outOh could I but save thee from the wreckyes continued she in a firmer tone perhaps the sacrifice of myself may atone for allI will go and offer myself to this divorceit boots not what becomes of me I will withdraw into the neighbouring monastery and waste the remainder of life in prayers and tears for my child andthe Prince Thou art as much too good for this world said  Isabella  as  Manfred  is execrablebut think not Lady that thy weakness shall determine for me I swear hear me all ye angelsstop I adjure thee cried  Hippolita  Remember thou dost not depend on thyself thou hast a father  my father is too pious too noble interrupted  Isabella  to command an impious deed But should he command it can a father enjoin a cursed act I was contracted to the son can I wed the fatherno Madam no force should not drag me to  Manfred  's hated bed I loath him I abhor him Divine and human laws forbidand my friend my dearest  Matilda  would I wound her tender soul by injuring her adored mother my own motherI never have known anotherOh she is the mother of both cried  Matilda  Can we can we  Isabella  adore her too much My lovely children said the touched  Hippolita  your tenderness overpowers mebut I must not give way to it It is not ours to make election for ourselves Heaven our fathers and our husbands must decide for us Have patience until you hear what  Manfred  and  Frederic  have determined If the Marquis accepts  Matilda  's hand I know she will readily obey Heaven may interpose and prevent the rest What means my child continued  she seeing  Matilda  fall at her feet with a flood of speechless tearsbut no answer me not my daughter I must not hear a word against the pleasure of thy father Oh doubt not my obedience my dreadful obedience to him and to you said  Matilda  But can I most respected of women can I experience all this tenderness this world of goodness and conceal a thought from the best of mothers What art thou going to utter said  Isabella  trembling Recollect thyself  Matilda  No  Isabella  said the Princess I should not deserve this incomparable parent if the inmost recesses of my soul harboured a thought without her permission nay I have offended her I have suffered a passion to enter my heart without her avowal but here I disclaim it here I vow to heaven and herMy child my child said  Hippolita  what words are these what new calamities has fate in store for us Thou a passion Thou in this hour of destructionOh I see all my guilt said  Matilda  I abhor myself if I cost  my mother a pang She is the dearest thing I have on earthoh I will never never behold him more  Isabella  said  Hippolita  thou art conscious to this unhappy secret whatever it is Speakwhat cried  Matilda  have I so forfeited my mother's love that she will not permit me even to speak my own guilt oh wretched wretched  Matilda  Thou art too cruel said  Isabella  to  Hippolita  Canst thou behold this anguish of a virtuous mind and not commiserate it Not pity my child said  Hippolita  catching  Matilda  in her armsOh I know she is good she is all virtue all tenderness and duty I do forgive thee my excellent my only hope The Princesses then revealed to  Hippolita  their mutual inclination for  Theodore  and the purpose of  Isabella  to resign him to  Matilda Hippolita  blamed their imprudence and shewed them the improbability that either father would consent to bestow his heiress on so poor a man though nobly born Some comfort it gave her to find their passion of so recent a date  and that  Theodore  had had but little cause to suspect it in either She strictly enjoined them to avoid all correspondence with him This  Matilda  servently promised But  Isabella  who flattered herself that she meant no more than to promote his union with her friend could not determine to avoid him and made no reply I will go to the convent said  Hippolita  and order new masses to be said for a deliverance from these calamitiesOh my mother said  Matilda  you mean to quit us You mean to take sanctuary and to give my father an opportunity of pursuing his fatal intention Alas on my knees I supplicate you to forbear will you leave me a prey to  Frederic  I will follow you to the conventBe at peace my child said  Hippolita  I will return instantly I will never abandon thee until I know it is the will of heaven and for thy benefit Do not deceive me said  Matilda  I will not marry  Frederic  until thou commandest itAlas What will become of me Why that exclamation  said  Hippolita  I have promised thee to return ah my mother replied  Matilda  stay and save me from myself A frown from thee can do more than all my father's severity I have given away my heart and you alone can make me recal it No more Said  Hippolita  thou must not relapse  Metilda  I can quit  Theodore  said she but must I wed another let me attend thee to the altar and shut myself from the world for ever Thy fate depends on thy father said  Hippolita  I have ill bestowed my tenderness if it has taught thee to revere aught beyond him Adieu my child I go to pray for thee  Hippolita  's real purpose was to demand of  Jerome  whether in conscience she might not consent to the divorce She had oft urged  Manfred  to resign the principality which the delicacy of her conscience rendered an hourly burthen to her These scruples concurred to make the separation from her husband appear less  dreadful to her than it would have seemed in any other situation  Jerome  at quitting the castle overnight had questioned  Theodore  severely why he had accused him to  Manfred  of being privy to his escape  Theodore  owned it had been with design to prevent  Manfred  's suspicion from alighting on  Matilda  and added the holiness of  Jerome  's life and character secured him from the tyrant's wrath  Jerome  was heartily grieved to discover his son's inclination for that Princess and leaving him to his rest promised in the morning to acquaint him with important reasons for conquering his passion  Theodore  like  Isabella  was too recently acquainted with parental authority to submit to its decisions against the impulse of his heart He had little curiosity to learn the Friar's reasons and less disposition to obey them The lovely  Matilda  had made stronger impressions on him than filial affection All night he pleased himself with visions of love and it was not till late after the morningoffice  that he recollected the Friar's commands to attend him at  Alfonso  's tomb  Young man said  Jerome  when he saw him this tardiness does not please me Have a father's commands already so little weight  Theodore  made awkward excuses and attributed his delay to having overslept himself And on whom were thy dreams employed said the Friar sternly His son blushed Come come resumed the Friar inconsiderate youth this must not be Eradicate this guilty passion from thy breastguilty passion cried  Theodore  Can guilt dwell with innocent beauty and virtuous modesty It is sinful replied the Friar to cherish those whom heaven has doomed to destruction A tyrant's race must be swept from the earth to the third and fourth generation Will heaven visit the innocent for the crimes of the guilty said  Theodore  The fair  Matilda  has virtues enoughto undo thee Interrupted  Jerome  Hast thou so soon forgotten that twice the savage  Manfred  has pronounced thy sentence  Nor have I forgotten Sir said  Theodore  that the charity of his daughter delivered me from his power I can forget injuries but never benefits The injuries thou hast received from  Manfred  's race said the Friar are beyond what thou canst conceiveReply not but view this holy image Beneath this marble monument rest the ashes of the good  Alfonso  a Prince adorned with every virtue The father of his people the delight of mankind Kneel head strong boy and list while a father unfolds a state of horror that will expel every sentiment from thy soul but sensations of sacred vengeance  Alfonso  muchinjured Prince let thy unsatisfied shade sit awful on the troubled air while these trembling lipsha who comes thereThe most wretched of women said  Hippolita  entering the choir Good Father art thou at leisurebut why this kneeling youth what means the horror imprinted on each countenance why at this venerable tomb alas hast thou seen aught We were pouring  forth our orisons to heaven replied the Friar with some confusion to put an end to the woes of this deplorable province Join with us Lady thy spotless soul may obtain an exemption from the judgments which the portents of these days but too speakingly denounce against thy house I pray servently to heaven to divert them said the pious Princess Thou knowest it has been the occupation of my life to wrest a blessing for my Lord and my harmless children One alas is taken from me would heaven but hear me for my poor  Matilda  Father intercede for herEvery heart will bless her Cried  Theodore  with raptureBe dumb rash youth said  Jerome  And thou fond Princess contend not with the Powers above The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away Bless his holy name and submit to his decrees I do most devoutly Said  Hippolita  But will he not spare my only comfort must  Matilda  perish too ah Father I camebut dismiss thy son No ear but thine must hear what I have to utter  May heaven grant thy every wish most excellent Princess said  Theodore  retiring  Jerome  frowned  Hippolita  then acquainted the Friar with the proposal she had suggested to  Manfred  his approbation of it and the tender of  Matilda  that he was gone to make to  Frederic Jerome  could not conceal his dislike of the motion which he covered under pretence of the improbability that  Frederic  the nearest of blood to  Alfonso  and who was come to claim his succession would yield to an alliance with the usurper of his right But nothing could equal the perplexity of the Friar when  Hippolita  confessed her readiness not to oppose the separation and demanded his opinion on the legality of her acquiescence The Friar catched eagerly at her request of his advice and without explaining his aversion to the proposed marriage of  Manfred  and  Isabella  he painted to  Hippolita  in the most alarming colours the sinfulness of her consent denounced judgments against her if she complied and enjoined  her in the severest terms to treat any such proposition with every mark of indignation and refusal  Manfred  in the mean time had broken his purpose to  Frederic  and proposed the double marriage That weak Prince who had been struck with the charms of  Matilda  listened but too eagerly to the offer He forgot his enmity to  Manfred  whom he saw but little hope of dispossessing by force and flattering himself that no issue might succeed from the union of his daughter with the Tyrant he looked upon his own succession to the principality as facilitated by wedding  Matilda  He made faint opposition to the proposal affecting for form only not to acquiesce unless  Hippolita  should consent to the divorce  Manfred  took that upon himself Transported with his success and impatient to see himself in a situation to expect sons he hastened to his wife's apartment determined to extort her compliance He learned with indignation that she was absent at the convent His  guilt suggested to him that she had probably been informed by  Isabella  of his purpose He doubted whether her retirement to the convent did not import an intention of remaining there until she could raise obstacles to their divorce and the suspicions he had already entertained of  Jerome  made him apprehend that the Friar would not only traverse his views but might have inspired  Hippolita  with the resolution of taking sanctuary Impatient to unravel this clue and to defeat its success  Manfred  hastened to the convent and arrived there as the Friar was earnestly exhorting the Princess never to yield to the divorce  Madam said  Manfred  what business drew you hither why did you not await my return from the Marquis I came to implore a blessing on your councils Replied  Hippolita  My councils do not need a Friar's intervention Said  Manfred  and of all men living is that hoary traitor the only one whom you delight to confer with Prosane Prince said  Jerome  is  it at the altar that thou chusest to insult the servants of the altarbut  Manfred  thy impious schemes are known Heaven and this virtuous Lady know themnay frown not Prince The church despises thy menaces Her thunders will be heard above thy wrath Dare to proceed in thy curst purpose of a divorce until her sentence be known and here I lance her Anathema at thy head Audacious rebel said  Manfred  endeavouring to conceal the awe with which the Friar's words inspired him Dost thou presume to threaten th  lawful Prince Thou art no lawful Prince said  Jerome  thou art no Princego discuss thy claim with  Frederic  and when that is doneit is done Replied  Manfred Frederic  accepts  Matilda  's hand and is content to wave his claim unless I have no male issueas he spoke those words three drops of blood fell from the nose of  Alfonso  's statue  Manfred  turned pale and the Princess sunk on her knees Behold said the Friar mark this miraculous indication that the  blood of  Alfonso  will never mix with that of  Manfred  My gracious Lord said  Hippolita  let us submit ourselves to heaven Think not thy ever obedient wise rebels against thy authority I have no will but that of my Lord and the church To that revere  d tribunal let us apply It does not depend on us to burst the bonds that unite us If the church shall approve the dissolution of our marriage be it so I have but few years and those of sorrow to pass Where can they be worn away so well as at the foot of this altar in prayers for thine and  Matilda  's safetybut thou shalt not remain here until then Said  Manfred  Repair with me to the castle and there I will advise on the proper measures for a divorcebut this meddling Friar comes not thither My hospitable roof shall never more harbour a traitorand for thy Reverence's offspring continued he I banish him from my dominions He I ween is no sacred personage nor under the protection of the church Whoever weds  Isabella  it shall  not be Father  Falconara  's startedup son They start up said the Friar who are suddenly beheld in the seat of lawful Princes but they wither away like the grass and their place knows them no more  Manfred  casting a look of scorn at the Friar led  Hippolita  forth but at the door of the church whispered one of his attendants to remain concealed about the convent and bring him instant notice if any one from the castle should repair thither  CHAP V  EVERY reflection which  Manfred  made on the Friar's behaviour conspired to persuade him that  Jerome  was privy to an amour between  Isabella  and  Theodore  But  Jerome  's new presumption so dissonant from his former meekness suggested still deeper apprehensions The Prince even suspected that the Friar depended on some secret support from  Frederic  whose arrival  coinciding with the novel appearance of  Theodore  seemed to bespeak a correspondence Still more was he troubled with the resemblance of  Theodore  to  Alfonso  's portrait The latter he knew had unquestionably died without issue  Frederic  had consented to bestow  Isabella  on him These contradictions agitated his mind with numberless pangs He saw but two methods of extricating himself from his difficulties The one was to resign his dominions to the Marquis Pride ambition and his reliance on ancient prophecies which had pointed out a possibility of his preserving them to his posterity combated that thought The other was to press his marriage with  Isabella  After long ruminating on these anxious thoughts as he marched silently with  Hippolita  to the castle he at last discoursed with that Princess on the subject of his disquiet and used every insinuating and plausible argument to extract her consent to even her promise of promoting the divorce  Hippolita  needed little persuasion to bend her to  his pleasure She endeavoured to win him over to the measure of resigning his dominions but finding her exhortations fruitless she assured him that as far as her conscience would allow she would raise no opposition to a separation though without better founded scruples than what he yet alledged she would not engage to be active in demanding it  This compliance though inadequate was sufficient to raise  Manfred  's hopes He trusted that his power and wealth would easily advance his suit at the court of  Rome  whither he resolved to engage  Frederic  to take a journey on purpose That Prince had discovered so much passion for  Matilda  that  Manfred  hoped to obtain all he wished by holding out or withdrawing his daughter's charms according as the Marquis should appear more or less disposed to cooperate in his views Even the absence of  Frederic  would be a material point gained until he could take farther measures for his security  Dismissing  Hippolita  to her apartment he repaired to that of the Marquis but crossing the great hall through which he was to pass he met  Bianca  That damsel he knew was in the confidence of both the young Ladies It immediately occurred to him to sift her on the subject of  Isabella  and  Theodore  Calling her aside into the recess of the oriel window of the hall and soothing her with many fair words and promises he demanded of her whether she knew ought of the state of  Isabella  's affections I my Lord no my Lordyes my Lord poor Lady she is wonderfully alarmed about her father's wounds but I tell her he will do well don't your Highness think so I do not ask you replied  Manfred  what she thinks about her father But you are in her secrets Come be a good girl and tell me is there any young manhayou understand meLord bless me understand your Highness no not I I told her a few vulnerary herbs and reposeI am not talking replied the Prince impatiently  about her father I know he will do well Bless me I rejoice to hear your Highness say so for though I thought it not right to let my young Lady despond methought his Greatness had a wan look and a somethingI remember when young  Ferdinand  was wounded by the  Venetian  Thou answerest from the point interrupted  Manfred  but here take this jewel perhaps that may fix thy attentionnay no reverences my favour shall not stop here come tell me truly how stands  Isabella  's heart Well your Highness has such a way said  Bianca  to be surebut can your Highness keep a secret if it should ever come out of your lipsit shall not it shall not Cried  Manfred  nay but swear your Highnessby my halidame if it should ever be known that I said itwhy truth is truth I do not think my Lady  Isabella  ever much affectioned my young Lord your Sonyet he was a sweet youth as one should seeI am sure if I had been a Princessbut bless me I must attend  my Lady  Matilda  she will marvel what is become of mestay cried  Manfred  thou hast not satisfied my question Hast thou ever carried any message any letterI good gracious cried  Bianca  I carry a letter I would not to be a Queen I hope your Highness thinks though I am poor I am honestdid your Highness never hear what Count  Marsigli  offered me when he came a wooing to my Lady  Matilda  I have not leisure said  Manfred  to listen to thy tales I do not question thy honesty But it is thy duty to conceal nothing from me How long has  Isabella  been acquainted with  Theodore  Nay there is nothing can escape your Highness said  Bianca  not that I know any thing of the matter  Theodore  to be sure is a proper young man and as my Lady  Matilda  says the very image of good  Alfonso  Has not your Highness remarked it yes yesnothou torturest me Said  Manfred  Where did they meet when who My Lady  Matilda  said  Bianca  No  no not  Matilda Isabella  when did  Isabella  first become acquainted with this  Theodore Virgin Mary  said  Bianca  how should I know Thou dost know said  Manfred  and I must know I willLord your Highness is not jealous of young  Theodore  said  Bianca  jealous no no Why should I be jealous perhaps I mean to unite themif I were sure  Isabella  would have no repugnancerepugnance no I'll warrant her said  Bianca  he is as comely a youth as ever trod on Christian ground We are all in love with him there is not a soul in the castle but would be rejoiced to have him for our PrinceI mean when it shall please heaven to call your Highness to itselfindeed said  Manfred  has it gone so far oh this cursed Friarbut I must not lose timego  Bianca  attend  Isabella  but I charge thee not a word of what has passed Find out how she is affected towards  Theodore  bring me good news and that ring has a companion Wait at the foot of the winding staircase  I am going to visit the Marquis and will talk farther with thee at my return  Manfred  after some general conversation desired  Frederic  to dismiss the two Knights his companions having to talk with him on urgent affairs As soon as they were alone he began in artful guise to sound the Marquis on the subject of  Matilda  and finding him disposed to his wish he let drop hints on the difficulties that would attend the celebration of their marriage unlessat that instant  Bianca  burst into the room with a wildness in her look and gestures that spoke the utmost terror Oh my Lord my Lord cried she we are all undone it is come again it is come again What is come again cried  Manfred  amazedoh the hand the Giant the handsupport me I am terrified out of my senses Cried  Bianca  I will not sleep in the castle tonight where shall I go my things may come after me tomorrow would I had been content to wed  Francisco  this comes of ambition What has terrified  thee thus young woman said the Marquis Thou art safe here be not alarmed Oh your Greatness is wonderful good said  Bianca  but I dare notno pray let me go I had rather leave every thing behind me than stay another hour under this roof Go to thou hast lost thy senses Said  Manfred  Interrupt us not we were communing on important mattersmy Lord this wench is subject to fitscome with me  Bianca  oh the Saints no said  Bianca  for certain it comes to warn your Highness why should it appear to me else I say my hours morning and evening oh if your Highness had believed  Diego  'Tis the same hand that he saw the foot to in the gallerychamberFather  Jerome  has often told us the prophecy would be out one of these days  Bianca  said he mark my wordsthou ravest said  Manfred  in a rage be gone and keep these fooleries to frighten thy companions what my Lord cried  Bianca  do you think I have seen nothing go to the foot of the  great stairs yourselfas I live I saw it Saw what tell us fair maid what thou hast seen Said  Frederic  Can your Highness listen said  Manfred  to the delirium of a silly wench who has heard stories of apparitions until she believes them This is more than fancy said the Marquis her terror is too natural and too strongly impressed to be the work of imagination Tell us fair maiden what it is has moved thee thus Yes my Lord thank your Greatness said  Bianca  I believe I look very pale I shall be better when I have recovered myselfI was going to my Lady  Isabella  's chamber by his Highness's orderwe do want the circumstances interrupted  Manfred  Since his Highness will have it so proceed but be brief Lord your Highness thwarts one so replied  Bianca  I fear my hairI am sure I never in my lifewell as I was telling your Greatness I was going by his Highness's order to my Lady  Isabella  's chamber She lies in the watchetcoloured chamber on the righthand one pair  of stairs So when I came to the great stairs I was looking on his Highness's present here grant me patience said  Manfred  will this wench never come to the point what imports it to the Marquis that I gave thee a bawble for thy faithful attendance on my daughter we want to know what thou sawest I was going to tell your Highness said  Bianca  if you would permit meSo as I was rubbing the ringI am sure I had not gone up three steps but I heard the rattling of armour for all the world such a clatter as  Diego  says he heard when the Giant turned him about in the gallerychamber what does she mean my Lord said the Marquis is your castle haunted by giants and goblins Lord what has not your Greatness heard the story of the Giant in the gallerychamber cried  Bianca  I marvel his Highness has not told youmay hap you do not know there is a prophecyThis trifling is intolerable interrupted  Manfred  Let us dismiss this silly wench my Lord we have more important  affairs to discuss By your favour said  Frederic  these are no trifles The enormous sabre I was directed to in the wood you casque its fellow are these visions of this poor maiden's brain so  Jaquez  thinks may it please your Greatness Said  Bianca  He says this moon will not be out without our seeing some strange revolution For my part I should not be surprized if it was to happen tomorrow for as I was saying when I heard the clattering of armour I was all in a cold sweatI looked up and if your Greatness will believe me I saw upon the uppermost banister of the great stairs a hand in armour as big as bigI thought I should have swoonedI never stopped until I came hither would I were well out of this castle My Lady  Matilda  told me but yestermorning that her Highness  Hippolita  knows somethingThou art an insolent cried  Manfred  Lord Marquis it much misgives me that this scene is concerted to affront me Are my own domestics suborned to spread tales injurious to my honour Pursue  your claim by manly daring or let us bury our feuds as was proposed by the intermarriage of our children But trust me it ill becomes a Prince of your bearing to practice on mercenary wenchesI scorn your imputation said  Frederic  until this hour I never set eyes on this damsel I have given her no jewelmy Lord my Lord your conscience your guilt accuses you and would throw the suspicion on me but keep your daughter and think no more of  Isabella  The judgments already fallen on your house forbid my matching into it  Manfred  alarmed at the resolute tone in which  Frederic  delivered these words endeavoured to pacify him Dismissing  Bianca  he made such submissions to the Marquis and threw in such artful encomiums on  Matilda  that  Frederic  was once more staggered However as his passion was of so recent a date it could not at once surmount the scruples he had conceived He had gathered enough from  Bianca  's discourse to persuade him that heaven declared itself against  Manfred  The proposed marriages too removed his claim to a distance and the principality of  Otranto  was a stronger temptation than the contingent reversion of it with  Matilda  Still he would not absolutely recede from his engagements but purposing to gain time he demanded of  Manfred  if it was true in fact that  Hippolita  consented to the divorce The Prince transported to find no other obstacle and depending on his influence over his wife assured the Marquis it was so and that he might satisfy himself of the truth from her own mouth  As they were thus discoursing word was brought that the banquet was prepared  Manfred  conducted  Frederic  to the great hall where they were received by  Hippolita  and the young Princesses  Manfred  placed the Marquis next to  Matilda  and seated himself between his wife and  Isabella Hippolita  comported herself with an easy gravity but the young Ladies were silent and melancholy  Manfred  who was determined to pursue his point with the Marquis in the  remainder of the evening pushed on the feast until it waxed late affecting unrestrained gaiety and plying  Frederic  with repeated goblets of wine The latter more upon his guard than  Manfred  wished declined his frequent challenges on pretence of his late loss of blood while the Prince to raise his own disordered spirits and to counterfeit unconcern indulged himself in plentiful draughts though not to the intoxication of his senses  The evening being far advanced the banquet concluded  Manfred  would have withdrawn with  Frederic  but the latter pleading weakness and want of repose retired to his chamber galantly telling the Prince that his daughter should amuse his Highness until himself could attend him  Manfred  accepted the party and to the no small grief of  Isabella  accompanied her to her apartment  Matilda  waited on her mother to enjoy the freshness of the evening on the ramparts of the castle  Soon as the company were dispersed their several ways  Frederic  quitting his chamber enquired if  Hippolita  was alone and was told by one of her attendants who had not noticed her going forth that at that hour she generally withdrew to her oratory where he probably would find her The Marquis during the repast had beheld  Matilda  with increase of passion He now wished to find  Hippolita  in the disposition her Lord had promised The portents that had alarmed him were forgotten in his desires Stealing softly and unobserved to the apartment of  Hippolita  he entered it with a resolution to encourage her acquiescence to the divorce having perceived that  Manfred  was resolved to make the possession of  Isabella  an unalterable condition before he would grant  Matilda  to his wishes  The Marquis was not surprized at the silence that reigned in the Princess's apartment Concluding her as he had been advertized in her oratory he passed on The door was ajar  the evening gloomy and overcast Pushing open the door gently he saw a person kneeling before the altar As he approached nearer it seemed not a woman but one in a long woollen weed whose back was towards him The person seemed absorbed in prayer The Marquis was about to return when the figure rising stood some moments fixed in meditation without regarding him The Marquis expecting the holy person to come forth and meaning to excuse his uncivil interruption said reverend Father I sought the Lady  Hippolita    Hippolita  replied a hollow voice camest thou to this castle to seek  Hippolita  and then the figure turning slowly round discovered to  Frederic  the fleshless jaws and empty sockets of a skeleton wrapt in a hermit's cowl Angels of grace protect me cried  Frederic  recoiling Deserve their protection said the Spectre  Frederic  falling on his knees adjured the Phantom to take pity on him Dost thou not remember me said the apparition Remember  the wood of  Joppa  Art thou that holy Hermit cried  Frederic  tremblingcan I do ought for thy eternal peaceWast thou delivered from bondage said the spectre to pursue carnal delights Hast thou forgotten the buried sabre and the behest of Heaven engraven on itI have not I have not said  Frederic  but say blest spirit what is thy errand to me what remains to be done To forget  Matilda  said the apparitionand vanished  Frederic  's blood froze in his veins For some minutes he remained motionless Then falling prostrate on his face before the altar he besought the intercession of every saint for pardon A flood of tears succeeded to this transport and the image of the beauteous  Matilda  rushing in spite of him on his thoughts he lay on the ground in a conflict of penitence and passion E'er he could recover from this agony of his spirits the Princess  Hippolita  with a taper in her hand entered the oratory alone Seeing a  man without motion on the floor she gave a shriek concluding him dead Her fright brought  Frederic  to himself Rising suddenly his face bedewed with tears he would have rushed from her presence but  Hippolita  stopping him conjured him in the most plaintive accents to explain the cause of his disorder and by what strange chance she had found him there in that posture Ah virtuous Princess said the Marquis penetrated with griefand stopped For the love of Heaven my Lord said  Hippolita  disclose the cause of this transport what mean these doleful sounds this alarming exclamation on my name What woes has heaven still in store for the wretched  Hippolita  yet silentby every pitying angel I adjure thee noble Prince continued she falling at his feet to disclose the purport of what lies at thy heart I see thou feelest for me thou feelest the sharp pangs that thou inflictestspeak for pity does ought thou knowest concern my child  I cannot speak cried  Frederic  bursting from herOh  Matilda  Quitting the Princess thus abruptly he hastened to his own apartment At the door of it he was accosted by  Manfred  who flushed by wine and love had come to seek him and to propose to waste some hours of the night in music and revelling  Frederic  offended at an invitation so dissonant from the mood of his soul pushed him rudely aside and entering his chamber flung the door intemperately against  Manfred  and bolted it inwards The haughty Prince enraged at this unaccountable behaviour withdrew in a frame of mind capable of the most fatal excesses As he crossed the court he was met by the domestic whom he had planted at the convent as a spy on  Jerome  and  Theodore  This man almost breathless with the haste he had made informed his Lord that  Theodore  and some lady from the castle were at that instant in private conference at the tomb of  Alfonso  in St  Nicholas  's church He had dogged  Theodore  thither but the gloominess of the night had prevented his discovering who the woman was  Manfred  whose spirits were inflamed and whom  Isabella  had driven from her on his urging his passion with too little reserve did not doubt but the inquietude she had expressed had been occasioned by her impatience to meet  Theodore  Provoked by this conjecture and enraged at her father he hastened secretly to the great church Gliding softly between the isles and guided by an imperfect gleam of moonshine that shone saintly through the illuminated windows he stole towards the tomb of  Alfonso  to which he was directed by indistinct whispers of the persons he sought The first sounds he could distinguish wereDoes it alas depend on me  Manfred  will never permit our unionNo this shall prevent it cried the tyrant drawing his dagger and plunging it over her shoulder into the bosom of the person that spokeah me I am slain  Castle of Otrento  Publishd by  Hodgson Fleet Street  cried  Matilda  sinking good heaven receive my soul Savage inhuman monster what hast thou done cried  Theodore  rushing on him and wrenching his dagger from himStop stop thy impious hand cried  Matilda  it is my father  Manfred  waking as from a trance beat his breast twisted his hands in his locks and endeavoured to recover his dagger from  Theodore  to dispatch himself  Theodore  scarce less distracted and only mastering the transports of his grief to assist  Matilda  had now by his cries drawn some of the monks to his aid While part of them endeavoured in concert with the afflicted  Theodore  to stop the blood of the dying Princess the rest prevented  Manfred  from laying violent hands on himself  Matilda  resigning herself patiently to her fate acknowledged with looks of grateful love the zeal of  Theodore  Yet oft as her faintness would permit her speech its way she begged the assistants to comfort her father  Jerome  by this time had learnt the fatal news and reached the  church His looks seemed to reproach  Theodore  but turning to  Manfred  he said now tyrant behold the completion of woe fulfilled on thy impious and devoted head The blood of  Alfonso  cried to heaven for vengeance and heaven has permitted its altar to be polluted by assassination that thou mightest shed thy own blood at the foot of that Prince's sepulchreCruel man cried  Matilda  to aggravate the woes of a parent may heaven bless my father and forgive him as I do My Lord my gracious Sire dost thou forgive thy child indeed I came not hither to meet  Theodore  I found him praying at this tomb whither my mother sent me to intercede for thee for herdearest father bless your child and say you forgive herforgive thee murderous monster cried  Manfred  can assassins forgive I took thee for  Isabella  but heaven directed my bloody hand to the heart of my childoh  Matilda  I cannot utter itcanst thou forgive the blindness of my rage I can I do and may heaven confirm it said  Matilda  but  while I have life to ask itOh my mother what will she feelwill you comfort her my Lord will you not put her away indeed she loves youoh I am faint bear me to the castlecan I live to have her close my eyes  Theodore  and the monks besought her earnestly to suffer herself to be born into the convent but her instances were so pressing to be carried to the castle that placing her on a litter they conveyed her thither as she requested  Theodore  supporting her head with his arm and hanging over her in an agony of despairing love still endeavoured to inspire her with hopes of life  Jerome  on the other side comforted her with discourses of heaven and holding a crucifix before her which she bathed with innocent tears prepared her for her passage to immortality  Manfred  plunged in the deepest affliction followed the litter in despair  E'er they reached the castle  Hippolita  informed of the dreadful catastrophe had flown to meet her murdered child but when she saw  the afflicted procession the mightiness of her grief deprived her of her senses and she fell lifeless to the earth in a swoon  Isabella  and  Frederic  who attended her were overwhelmed in almost equal sorrow  Matilda  alone seemed insensible to her own situation every thought was lost in tenderness for her mother Ordering the litter to stop as soon as  Hippolita  was brought to herself she asked for her father He approached unable to speak  Matilda  seizing his hand and her mother's locked them in her own and then clasped them to her heart  Manfred  could not support this act of pathetic piety He dashed himself on the ground and cursed the day he was born  Isabella  apprehensive that these struggles of passion were more than  Matilda  could support took upon herself to order  Manfred  to be borne to his apartment while she caused  Matilda  to be conveyed to the nearest chamber  Hippolita  scarce more alive than her daughter was regardless of every thing but her but when the tender  Isabella  's care would have  likewise removed her while the surgeons examined  Matilda  's wound she cried remove me never never I lived but in her and will expire with her  Matilda  raised her eyes at her mother's voice but closed them again without speaking Her sinking pulse and the damp coldness of her hand soon dispelled all hopes of recovery  Theodore  followed the surgeons into the outer chamber and heard them pronounce the fatal sentence with a transport equal to frenzy Since she cannot live mine cried he at least she shall be mine in deathFather  Jerome  will you not join our hands cried he to the Friar who with the Marquis had accompanied the surgeons What means thy distracted rashness said  Jerome  is this an hour for marriage It is it is cried  Theodore  alas there is no other Young man thou art too unadvised said  Frederic  dost thou think we are to listen to thy fond transports in this hour of fate what pretensions hast thou to the Princess Those of a Prince said  Theodore  of the sovereign of  Otranto  This reverend man my father has informed me who I am Thou ravest said the Marquis there is no prince of  Otranto  but myself now  Manfred  by murder by sacrilegious murder has forfeited all pretensions My Lord said  Jerome  assuming an air of command he tells you true It was not my purpose the secret should have been divulged so soon but fate presses onward to its work What his hot headed passion has revealed my tongue confirms Know Prince that when  Alfonso  set sail for the Holy Land is this a season for explanations cried  Theodore  Father come and unite me to the Princess she shall be minein every other thing I will dutifully obey you My life my adored  Matilda  continued  Theodore  rushing back into the inner chamber will you not be mine will you not bless your  Isabella  made signs to him to be silent apprehending the Princess was near her end What is she dead cried  Theodore  is it possible The violence of his exclamations brought  Matilda  to herself Lifting up her eyes  she looked round for her motherLife of my soul I am here cried  Hippolita  think not I will quit thee Oh you are too good said  Matilda  but weep not for me my mother I am going where sorrow never dwells  Isabella  thou hast loved me wot thou not supply my fondness to this dear dear womanindeed I am faint Oh my child my child said  Hippolita  in a flood of tears can I not withhold thee a momentIt will not be said  Matilda  commend me to heavenwhere is my father forgive him dearest motherforgive him my death it was an errorOh I had forgotten dearest mother I vowed never to see  Theodore  moreperhaps that has drawn down this calamity but it was not intentionalcan you pardon meOh wound not my agonizing soul said  Hippolita  thou never couldst offend mealas I she faints help helpI would say something more said  Matilda  struggling but it wonnot be  Isabella    Theodore  for my sakeOhshe expired  Isabella  and her women  tore  Hippolita  from the corse but  Theodore  threatened destruction to all who attempted to remove him from it He printed a thousand kisses on her claycold hands and uttered every expression that despairing love could dictate  Isabella  in the mean time was accompanying the afflicted  Hippolita  to her apartment but in the middle of the court they were met by  Manfred  who distracted with his own thoughts and anxious once more to behold his daughter was advancing to the chamber where she lay As the moon was now at its height he read in the countenances of this unhappy company the event he dreaded What is she dead cried he in wild confusiona clap of thunder at that instant shook the castle to its foundations the earth rocked and the clank of more than mortal armour was heard behind  Frederic  and  Jerome  thought the last day was at hand The latter forcing  Theodore  along with them rushed into the court The moment  Theodore  appeared the walls of the castle behind  Manfred  were  thrown down with a mighty force and the form of  Alfonso  dilated to an immense magnitude appeared in the center of the ruins Behold in  Theodore  the true heir of  Alfonso  said the vision And having pronounced those words accompanied by a clap of thunder it ascended solemnly towards heaven where the clouds parting asunder the form of St  Nicholas  was seen and receiving  Alfonso  's shade they were soon wrapt from mortal eyes in a blaze of glory  The beholders fell prostrate on their faces acknowledging the divine will The first that broke silence was  Hippolita  My Lord said she to the desponding  Manfred  behold the vanity of human greatness  Conrad  is gone  Matilda  is no more in  Theodore  we view the true Prince of  Otranto  By what miracle he is so I know notsuffice it to us our doom is pronounced shall we not can we but dedicate the few deplorable hours we have to live in deprecating the farther wrath of heaven heaven ejects us whither can we fly but to yon holy cells  that yet offer us a retreatThou guiltless but unhappy woman unhappy by my crimes replied  Manfred  my heart at last is open to thy devout admonitions Oh couldbut it cannot beye are lost in wonderlet me at last do justice on myself To heap shame on my own head is all the satisfaction I have left to offer to offended heaven My story has drawn down these judgments Let my confession atone but ah what can atone for usurpation and a murdered child a child murdered in a consecrated placeList Sirs and may this bloody record be a warning to future tyrants  Alfonso  ye all know died in the holy land ye would interrupt me ye would say he came not fairly to his endit is most true why else this bitter cup which  Manfred  must drink to the dregs  Ricardo  my grandfather was his chamberlainI would draw a veil over my ancestor's crimesbut it is in vain  Alfonso  died by poison A fictitious will declared  Ricardo  his heir His crimes pursued himyet he  lost no  Conrad  no  Matilda  I pay the price of usurpation for all A storm overtook him Haunted by his guilt he vowed to St  Nicholas  to found a church and two convents if he lived to reach  Otranto  The sacrifice was accepted the saint appeared to him in a dream and promised that  Ricardo  's posterity should reign in  Otranto  until the rightful owner should be grown too large to inhabit the castle and as long as issuemale from  Ricardo  's loins should remain to enjoy itAlas alas nor male nor female except myself remains of all his wretched raceI have donethe woes of these three days speak the rest How this young man can be  Alfonso  's heir I know notyet I do not doubt it His are these dominions I resign themyet I knew not  Alfonso  had an heirI question not the will of heavenpoverty and prayer must fill up the woeful space until  Manfred  shall be summoned to  Ricardo  What remains is my part to declare said  Jerome  When  Alfonso  set sail for the holy land  he was driven by a storm to the coast of  Sicily  The other vessel which bore  Ricardo  and his train as your  Lordship  must have heard was separated from him It is most true said  Manfred  and the title you give me is more than an outcast can claimwell be it soproceed  Jerome  blushed and continued For three months Lord  Alfonso  was wind bound in  Sicily  There he became enamoured of a fair virgin named  Victoria  He was too pious to tempt her to forbidden pleasures They were married Yet deeming this amour incongruous with the holy vow of arms by which he was bound he determined to conceal their nuptials until his return from the Crusado when he purposed to seek and acknowledge her for his lawful wife He left her pregnant During his absence she was delivered of a daughter But scarce had she felt a mother's pangs ere she heard the fatal rumour of her Lord's death and the succession of  Ricardo  What could a friendless helpless woman do would her testimony availyet  my Lord I have an authentic writingIt needs not said  Manfred  the horrors of these days the vision we have but now seen all corroborate thy evidence beyond a thousand parchments  Matilda  's death and my expulsion Be composed my Lord said  Hippolita  this holy man did not mean to recal your griefs  Jerome  proceeded  I shall not dwell on what is needless The daughter of which  Victoria  was delivered was at her maturity bestowed in marriage on me  Victoria  died and the secret remained locked in my breast  Theodore  's narrative has told the rest  The Friar ceased The disconsolate company retired to the remaining part of the castle In the morning  Manfred  signed his abdication of the principality with the approbation of  Hippolita  and each took on them the habit of religion in the neighbouring convents  Frederic  offered his daughter to the new Prince which  Hippolita  's tenderness for  Isabella  concurred to  promote But  Theodore  's grief was too fresh to admit the thought of another love and it was not until after frequent discourses with  Isabella  of his dear  Matilda  that he was persuaded he could know no happiness but in the society of one with whom he could for ever indulge the melancholy that had taken possession of his soul  FINIS
