great Quarrels that have happen'd in our Neighbourhood since the Death of the late Lord  Strutt  how the Parson and a cunning Attorney got him to settle his Estate upon his Cousin  Philip Baboon  to the great disappointment of his Cousin Esquire  South  Some stick not to say that the Parson and the Attorney forg'd a Will for which they were well Paid by the Family of the  Baboons  Let that be as it will it is matter of Fact that the Honour and Estate have continued ever since in the Person of  Philip Baboon  You know that the Lord  Strutts  have for many Years been possess'd of a very great Landed Estate well condition  d wooded water  d with Coal Salt Tin Copper Iron  c  all within themselves that it has been the Misfortune of that Family to be the Property of their Stewards Tradesmen and inferior Servants which has brought great Incumbrances upon them at the same time not abating of their expensive way of Living has forc'd them to Mortgage their best Manors It is credibly reported that the Butchers and Bakers Bills of a Lord  Strutt  that lived Two hundred Years ago▪ are not yet paid  When  Philip Baboon  came first to the Possession of the Lord  Strutt  's Estate his Tradesmen as is usual upon such Occasions waited upon him to wish him Joy and bespeak his Custom The two chief were  John Bull  the Clothier and  Nic Frog  the Linnendraper they told him that the  Bulls  and  Frogs  had serv'd the Lord  Strutts  with Drapery Ware for many Years that they were honest and fair Dealers that their Bills had never been question'd that the Lord  Strutts  lived generously and never us'd to dirty their Fingers with Pen Ink and Counters that his Lordship might depend upon their Honesty that they would use him as kindly as they had  ne his Predecessors The young Lord seem  d to  all in good Part and dismiss'd them with a deal of  Content assuring them he did not intend to  any of the honourable Maxims of his Predecessors  CHAP II How  Bull  and  Frog  grew jealous that the Lord  Strutt  tended to give all his Customs to his Grandfather  Baboon  IT happen'd unfortunately for the Peace of our Ne  +bourhood that this Young Lord had an old cunni  Rogue or as the  Scots  call it a  false Loon  of a Gra  father that one might justly call a  Jack of all Tra  sometimes you would see him behind his Counter sell  Broad Cloth sometimes measuring Linnen next Day  would be dealing in Mercery Ware high heads R  +bons Gloves Fans and Lace he understood to a nice  Charles Mather  could not bubble a young Beau bet  with a Toy nay he would descend even to the sell  of Tape Garters and Shooebuckles When Shop  shut up he would go about the Neighbourhood and ea  Half a Crown by teaching the young Men and Maids  Dance By these Methods he had acquir'd imme  Riches which he us'd to squander away at BackSwor  QuarterStaff and Cudgel play in which he took gre  Pleasure and challeng'd all the Country You will  it is no wonder if  Bull  and  Frog  should be jealous of th  F  llow  It is not impossible says  Frog  to  Bull  but th  old Rogue will take the Management of the  ou  Lord's Business into his Hands besides the Rasc  has good Ware and will serve him as cheap as a  body in that Case I leave you to judge what mu  become of us and our Families we must starve or tu  Journeymen to  Lewis Baboon  therefore Neighbou  I hold it adviseable that we write to young Lor  Strutt  to know the Bottom of this Matter  CHAP III A Copy of Bull and Frog's Letter to the Lord Strutt  My LORD  I Suppose your Lordship knows that the  Bulls  and the  Frog  have served the Lord  Strutts  with all Sorts of Draper Ware Time out of Mind and whereas we are jealous  not without Reason that your Lordship intends henceforth to buy of your Grandsire old  Lewis Baboon  This is to inform your Lordship that this Procceediug does not suit with the Circumstances of our Families who have lived and made a good Figure in the World by the Generosity of the Lord  Strutts  Therefore we think fit to acquaint your Lordship that you must find sufficient Security to us our Heirs and Assigns that you will not employ  Lewis Baboon  or else we take our Remedy at Law clap an Action upon you of  l  for old Debts seize and distrain your Goods and Chattels which considering your Lordship's Circumstances will plunge you into Difficulties from which it will not be easie to extricate your self therefore we hope when your Lordship has better consider'd on it you will comply with the Desire of  Your loving Friends John Bull Nic Frog  Some of  Bull  's Friends advised him to take gentler Methods with the young Lord but  John  naturally lov'd rough play It is impossible to express the Surprize of the Lord  Strutt  upon the Receipt of his Letter he was not flush in  Ready  either to go to Law or clear old Debts neither could he find good Bail He offer'd to bring Matters to a friendly Accommodation and promis'd upon his Word of Honour that he would not change his Drapers but all to no purpose for  Bull  and  Frog  saw clearly that old  Lewis  would have the Cheating of him  CHAP IV How  Bull  and  Frog  went to Law with Lord  Strutt  about the Premisses and were joyn'd by the rest of the Tradesmen  ALL Endeavours of Accommodation between Lord  Strutt  and his Drapers prov'd vain Jealousies encreas  d and indeed it was rumour'd abroad that Lord  Strutt  had bespoke his new Liveries of old  Lewis Baboon  This coming to Mrs  Bull  's Ears when  John Bull  came Home he found all his Family in an uproar Mrs  Bull  you must know was very apt to be Cholerick  You Sot  says she  you loyter about Alehouses and Taverns spend your Time  t Billiards Ninepins or Puppetshows or flaunt about the Stre  ts in your new gilt Chariot never minding me nor your numerous Family don't you hear  how Lord  Strutt  has bespoke his Liveries at  Lewis Baboon's  shop don't you see how that old Fox steals away your Customers and turns you out of your Business every Day and you sit like an idle Drone with your Hands in your Pockets Fie  up Man rouze thy self I  ll sell to my Shift before  ll be so used by that Knave  You must think Mrs  Bull  had been pretty well tun'd up by  Frog  who chim'd in with her learn  d Harangue No further delay now but to Counsel learn'd in the Law they go who unanimously assur'd 'em both of the Justice and infallible Success of their LawSuit  I told you before that old  Lewis Baboon  was a sort of a  Jack of all Trades  which made the rest of the Tradesmen jealous as well as  Bull  and  Frog  they hearing of the Quarrel were glad of an opportunity of joyning against old  Lewis Baboon  provided that  Bull  and  Frog  would bear the Charges of the Suit even Lying  Ned  the Chimneysweeper and  Tom  the Dustman put in their Claims and the Cause was put into the Hands of  Humphrey Hocus  the Attorney  A Declaration was drawn up to shew  That  Bull  and  Frog  had undoubted Right by Prescription to be Drapers to the Lord  Strutts  that there were several old Contracts to that purpose that  Lewis Baboon  had taken up the Trade of Clothier and Draper without serving his Time or purchasing his Freedom that he sold Goods that were not Marketable without the Stamp that he himself was more fit for a Bully than a Tradesman and went about through all the Country Fairs challenging People to fight Prizes Wrestling and Cudgelplay And abundance more to this purpose  CHAP V The true Characters of John Bull Nic Frog and Hocus  FOR the better understanding the following History the Reader ought to know That  Bull  in the main was an honest plaindealing Fellow Cholerick Bold and of a very unconstant Temper he dreaded not Old  Lewis  either at BackSword single Fauchion or Cudgelplay but then he was very apt to quarrel with his best Friends especially if they pretended to govern him If you f  atter'd him▪ you might lead him like a Child  John  's Temper depended very much upon  the Air his Spirits rose and fell with the Weatherglass  John  was quick and understood his Business very well but no Man alive was more careless in looking into his Accounts or more cheated by Partners Apprentices and Servants This was occasioned by his being a BoonCompanion loving his Bottle and his Diversion for to say Truth no Man kept a better House than  John  nor spent his Money more generously By plain and fair dealing  John  had acquir'd some Plumbs and might have kept them had it not been for his unhappy LawSuit  Nic Frog  was a cunning fly Whore  on quite the reverse of  John  in many Particulars Covetous Frugal minded domestick Affairs would pine his Belly to save his Pocket never lost a Farthing by careless Servants or bad Debtors He did not care much for any sort of Diversions except Tricks of  HighGerman  Artists and  Leger de main  no Man exceeded  Nic  in these yet it must be own'd That  Nic  was a fair Dealer and in that way had acquir'd immense Riches  Hocus  was an old cunning Attorney what he wanted of Ski  l in Law was made up by a Clerk which he kept that was the prettiest Fel  ow in the World he lov'd Money was smooth Tongu'd gave good Words and seldom lost his Temper He was not worse than an Infidel for he provided plentifu  ly for his Family but he lov'd himself better than them all He had a termagant Wise and as the Neighbours said was plaguy Henpeck'd he was seldom ob  erv'd as some At  ornies will practice to give his own personal Evidence in Causes he rather chose to do it  per test conduct  in a word the Man was very well for an Attorney  CHAP VI Of the various Success of the LawSuit  LAW is a Bottomless Pit it is a Cormorant a Harpy that devours every thing John Bull  was flatter'd by his Lawyers that his Suit would not last above a Year or two at most that before that time he would be in quiet Possession of his Business yet ten long Years did  Hocus  steer his Cause through all the  Meanders  of the Law and  all the Courts no Skill no Address was wanting and to say Truth  John  did not starve the Cause there wanted not  Tellow Boys  to see Counsel hire Witnesses and bribe Juries Lord  Strutt  was generally Cast  never had one Verdict in his favour and  John  was promis'd That the next would be the final Determination but alas that final Determination and happy Conclusion was like an inchanted Island the nearer  John  came to it the further it went from him New Tryals upon new Points still arose new Doubts new Matters to be cleared in short Lawyers seldom part with so good a Cause ti  they have got the Oyster and their Clients the Shell  John  Money Book Debts Bonds Mortgages all went into the Lawyers Pockets then  John  began to borrow Money up in  BankStock EastIndia  Bonds and now and then  Farm went to Pot At last it was thought a good Expedient to set up Esquire  South  's Title to prove the Wi  Forg'd and dispossess  Philip  Lord  Strutt  at once here a gain was a new Field for the  Lawyers  and the Caul grew more intricate than ever  John  grew madder and madder Wherever he met any of Lord  Strutt's  Servants he tore off their Cloaths Now and then you would see them come home naked without Shoes Stockings and Linnen As for Old  Lewis Baboon  he was reduc'd to his last Shift tho' he had as many as any other His Children were reduced from rich Silks to  Doi  Stuff  his Servants in Rags and bareFooted instead or good Victuals they now lived upon NeckBees and BullocksLiver in short no Body got much by the Matter but the Men of Law  CHAP VII How John Bull was so mightily pleas'd with his Success tha  he was going to leav  off his Trade  and turn Lawyer  IT is wisely observed by a great Philosopher That Ha  bit is a second Nature This was verify'd in the Case o  John Bull  who from an honest and plain Tradesman had got such a haunt about the Courts of Justice and such a Jargon of Lawwords that he concluded himself as able a Lawyer as any that pleaded at the Bar or sat on the Bench He was overheard one day talking to himself after this manner  How capriciously does Fate or Chance dispose of Mankind How seldom is that Business allotted to a Man for which he is fitted by Nature It is plain I was intended for a Man of  Law  How did my Guardians mistake my Genius in placing me like a mean Slave behind a Counter  Bless me What immense Estates these Fellows raise by the Law Besides it is the Profession of a Gentleman What a Pleasure it is to be victorious in a Cause To swagger at the Bar What a Fool am I to drudge any more in this Woollen Trade for a Lawyer I was born and a Lawyer I will be one is never too Old to learn▪  All this while  John  had con'd over such a Catalogue of hard words as were enough to conjure up the Devil these he used to bubble indifferently in all Companies especially at Coffeehouses so that his Neighbour Tradesmen began to shun his Company as a Man that was crack  d Instead of the Affairs of  BlackwellHall  and Price of Broadcloath Wooll and Bayses he talk'd of nothing but  Actions upon the Case Returns Capias alias capias Demurrers Venire facias Replevins Supersedea's Certiorari's Writs of Error Actions of Trovre and Conversion Trespasses Precipes Dedimus  This was matter of Jest to the learned in Law however  Hocus  and the rest of the Tribe encourag'd  John  in his Fancy assuring him That he had a great Genius for Law That they question'd not but in time he might raise Money enough by it to reimburse him of all his Charges That if he study'd he would undoubtedly arrive to the Dignity of a Lord Chief Justice as for the Advice of honest Friends and Neighbours  John  despis'd it he look'd upon them as Fellows of a low Genius poor grovelling Mechanicks  John  reckon'd it more Honour to have got one favourable Verdict than to have sold a Bale of Broadcloath As for  Nic Frog  to say the Truth he was more prudent for tho' he follow'd his LawSuit closely he neglected not his Ordinary Business but was both in Court and in his Shop at the proper Hours  CHAP VIII How John discover'd that Hocus had an Intrigue with his Wife and what follow'd thereupon  JOhn  had not run on a madding so long had it not been for an extravagant Bitch of a Wife whom  Hocus  perceiving  John  to be fond of resolv'd to win over to his side It is a true saying  That the last Man of the Parish that knows of his Cuckoldom is himself  It 'twas observed by all the Neighbourhood that  Hocus  had Dealings with  John  's  Wife  that were not so much for  his Honour but this was perceiv'd by  John  a little too late She was a luxurious Jade lov'd splendid Equipages Plays Treats and Ba  ls differing very much from the sober Manners of her Ancestors and by no means fit for a Tradesman's Wife  Hocus  fed  er Extravagancy what was still more shameful with  John's  own Money Every body said that  Hocus  had a Months mind to her Body be that as it will it is matter of Fact  that  upon all occasions she run out extravagantly on the Praise of  Hocus  When  John  us'd to be finding fault with his Bills she us'd to reproach him as ungrateful to his greatest Benefactor One that had taken so much pains in his LawSuit and retriev'd his Family from the Oppression of old  Lewis Baboon  A  good swinging Sum of John's  readiest Cash went towards building of  Hocus  's Country House This Affair between  Hocus  and Mrs  Bull  was now so open that all the World were scandaliz'd at it  John was not so Clodpated  but at  last  he took the Hint The Parson of the Parish Preaching one Day a little sharply against Adultery Mrs  Bull  told her Husband▪ That he was a very uncivil Fellow to use such course Language before People o  Condition That  Hocus  was of the same mind and that they would joyn to have him turn'd out of his Living for using personal Reflections How do you mean says  John  by personal Reflections I hope in God Wi  e he did not reflect upon you No thank God my Reputation is too well established in the World to receive any hurt from such a  oul Mouth'd Scoundre  l as he his Doctrine tends only to make Husbands Tyrants and Wive Slaves must we be shut up and Husbands left to their Liberty Very pretty indeed a Wi  e must never go abroad with a Platonick to see a Play or a Ball she must never stir without her Husband nor walk in Spring Garden with a Cousin I do say Husband and I will stand by it That without the innocent Freedoms of Life Matrimony would be a most intollerable State And that a Wi  e's Virtue ought to be the result of her own reason and not of her Husband  s Government for my part I would scorn a Husband that would be Jealous if he saw a Fellow in Bed with me All this while  John  's Blood boyl'd  o his Veins he was now confirm'd  in all his Suspicions Jade Bitch and Whore were the best Words that  John  gave her Things went from better to worse 'till Mrs  Bull  aim'd a Knife at  John  tho'  John  threw a Bottle at her Head very brutally indeed After this there was nothing but Confusion Bottles Glasses Spoons Plates Knives Forks and Dishes flew about like Dust res  lt of which was That Mrs  Bull  receiv'd a bruise in her Right side of which she dy'd half a Year after The Bruise imposthumated and afterwards turn'd to a stinking Ulcer which made every body shie to come near her she melt so yet she wanted not the help of many able Physicians who attended very diligently and did what Men of skill could do but all to no purpose for her Condition was now quite desperate all regular Physicians and her nearest Relations having giv'n her over  CHAP IX How Signior Cavallo an Italian Quack undertook to Cure Mrs Bull of her Ulcer  THere is nothing so impossible in Nature but Montebanks will undertake nothing so incredible but they will affirm Mrs  Bull  's Condition was look'd upon as desperate by all the Men of Art then Signior  Cavallo  judged it was high time for him to interpose he bragged that he had an infallible Ointment and Plaister which being applied to the Sore would Cure it in a few Days at the same time he would give her a Pill that would purge off all her bad Humours sweeten her Blood and rectifie her disturb'd Imagination In spite of all Signior  Cavallo  's Applications the Patient grew worse every Day she stank so no body durst come within a Stone's throw of her except Signior  Cavallo  and his Wife▪ whom he sent every Day to Dress her she having a very gentle soft Hand All this while Signior apprehended no Danger If one ask'd him how Mrs  Bull  did better and better says Signior  Cavallo  the Parts heal and her Constitution mends if she submits to my Government▪ she will be abroad in a little time Nay it is reported that he wrote to her Friends in the Country that she should Dance a Jig next  October  in  Westmister  Hall that her Illness had been chiefly owing to bad Physicians At last Signior one Day was sent  for in great haste his Patient growing worse and worse when he came he affirmed that it was a gross Mistake that she never was in a fairer Way Bring hither the Salve says he and give her a plentiful Draught of my Cordial As he was applying his Ointments and administring the Cordial▪ the Patient gave up the Ghost to the great Confusion of Signior  Cavalio  and the great Joy of  Bull  and his Friends Signior slung away out of the House in great disorder and swore there was foul Play for he was sure his Medicines were infallible Mrs  Bull  having dy'd without any Signs of Repentance or Devotion the Clergy would hardly allow her Christian Burial The Relations had once resolved to sue  John  for the Murder but considering better of it and that such a Trial would rip up old Sores and discover things not so much to the Reputation of the Deceased they dropt their Design She left no Will only there was found in her strong Box the following Words wrote on a scrip of Paper  My Curse on  John Bull  and all my Posterity if ever they come to any Composition with my Lord  Strutt There were many Epitaphs writ upon her one was as follows  Here lies  John  't Wife  Plague of his Life  She spent his Wealth  She wrong'd his Health  And left him Daughters three  As bad as she  The Daughters Names were  Polemia Discordia  and  Ʋsuria  CHAP X Of John Bull's second Wise and the good Advice that she gave him  JOHN  quickly got the better of his Grief and seeing that neither his Constitution nor the Affairs of his Family could permit him to live in an unmarried State he resolved to get him another Wife a Cousin of his last Wife's was propos'd but  John  would have no more of the Breed In short he wedded a sober Country Gentlewoman of a good Family and a p  entiful Fortune the reverse of the other in her Temper not but that she lov'd Money for she was of a saving Temper and apply'd her Fortune to pay  John  's clamarous Debts that the unfrugal Methods of his last Wife and this ruinous Law Suit had brought him into One day as she  her Husband in good Humour she talk'd to him  after the following manner  My Dear since I have been  our Wife I have Observ  d great Abuses and Disorders in  ur Family your Servants are mutinous and quarrelsom  d cheat you most abominably your CookMaid is in Com  ination with your Butcher Poulterer and Wishmonger  ur Butler purloin your Liquor and your Brew  r sells your  ogwash your Baker cheats both in Weight and in Tale  en your Milkwoman and your Nursary Maid have a Fellow  eling your Taylor instead of Shreads Cabages whole  ards of Cloth besides leaving such long Scores and not  ing to Market with ready Money forces us to take bad Ware  the Tradesmen at their own Price You have not posted  Books these Ten Years how is it possible for a Man of  usiness to keep his Affairs even in the World at this Rate  ay God this  Hocus  be Honest would to God you would  over his Bills and see how Matters stand between  Frog  d you prodigious Sums are spent in this Law Suit and more  st be borrow'd of Scriveners and Usurers at heavy Interest  sides my Dear let me beg of you to lay aside that wild  ject of leaving your Business to turn Lawyer for which  me tell you Nature never design'd you Believe me these  gues do but flatter that they may pick your Pocket John  ard her all this while with patience till she prcik'd  Maggot and touch'd his tender point then he broke  in a violent Passion  What I not fit for a Lawyer  me tell you my Clodpated Relations spoil'd the greatest  ius in the World when they bred me a Mechanick Lord  tt and his Old Rogue of a Gransire have found to their  that I can magine a Law Suit as well as another I  deny what you say says Mrs  Bull  nor do I call in que  your Parts but I say it does not suit with your Circum  ces you and your Predecessors have Liv'd in good Repu  on among your Neighbours by this same Cloathing Trade  it were madness to leave it off Besides there are few  know all the Tricks and Cheats of these Lawyers does  our own Experience teach you how they have drawn you  om one Term to another and how you have danc'd the  of all the Courts still flattering you with a final Issue  for ought I can see your Cause is not a bit clearer than it  seven Years ago I will be Damn'd says  John  if I  of any Composition from  Strutt  or his Grandfather I'll  wheel about the Streets an Engine to grind Knives and  Scissars however I'll take your Advice and look over my Accounts  CHAP XI How John look'd over his Attorney's Bill  WHen  John  first brought out the Bills the Surprize of all the Family was unexpressible at the prodigious Dimensions of them in short they would have measur'd with the best Bale of Cloath in  John  's Shop Fees to Judges puny Judges Clerks Prothonotories Philizers C  irographers Underclerks Proclamators Council Witnesses JuryMen Marshals Tipstaffs Cryers Porters for Enrollings Exemplifications Bails Vouchers Returns Cavea  s Examinations Fil  ngs of Words Entries Declarations Replications Recordats  Nolle Pros q  i's Certiorari's Mittimus  Demurrers Special Verdicts Informations  Scire Facius Supersiedeas  abeas Corpus  Coachhire Treating of Witnesses  c Verily  says  John there are a prodigious Number of learned Words in this Law what a pretty Science it is Ay but Husband you have paid for every sylable and Letter of these fine Words bless me what immense Sums are at the bottom of the Accompt John  spent several Weeks in looking over his Bills and by comparing and stating his Accompts he discover  d that besides the Extravagance of every Article he had been egregiously cheated that he had paid for Councel that were never fee'd for Writs that were never drawn for Dinners that were never dress'd and Journeys that were never made In short that  Hocus  and  Frog  had agreed to throw the Burden of the LawSuit upon his Shoulders  CHAP XII How John grew Angry resolved to accept a Composition and what Methods were practis'd by the Lawyers for keeping him from it  WELL might the Learn'd  Daniel Burgess  say  That a LawSuit is a Suit for Life  He that sows his Grain upon Marble will have many a hungry Belly before Harvest This  John  felt by woful Experience  John  s Cause was a good milch Cow and many a Man subsisted his Family out of it However  John  began to think it high time to look about him he had a Cousin in the Country one Sir  Roger Bold  whose Predecessors had been bred up to the Law and knew as much of it as any Body but having left off the Profession  for some time they took great pleasure in Compounding LawSuits amongst their Neighbours for which they were the Aversion of the Gentlemen of the Long Robe and at perpetual War with all the Country Attorneys  John  put his Cause in Sir  Roger  's Hands desiring him to make the best of it the News had no sooner reach'd the Ears of the Lawyers but they were all in an Uproar They brought all the rest of the Tradesmen upon  John  'Squire  South  swore he was betray  d that he would starve before he compounded  Frog  said he was highly wrong'd ev'n lying  Ned  the Chimneysweeper and  Tom  the Dustman complain'd that their Interest was sacrific'd As for  Hocus  s Wife she took a HackneyChair and came to  John  's House immediately and fell a scolding at his Wife like the Mother of  Belzebub  You silly aukward illbred Country Sow you have you no more Manners than to rail at my Husband that has sav'd that Clodpated Numskull'd Ninny hammer of yours from Ruin and all his Family it is well known how he has rose early and sate up late to make him easy when he was Sotting at every Alehouse in Town I knew his last Wife she was a Woman of breeding good humour and complaisance knew how to live in the World as for you you look like a Puppet mov'd by Clockwork your Cloaths hang upon you as they were upon Tenterhooks and you come into a Room as you were going to steal away a Piss pot get you gone into the Country to look af your Mothers Poultry to milk the Cows churn the Butter and dress up Nosegays for a HolyDay and meddle not with Matters that you know no more of than the Signpost before your Door It is well known that my Husband has an establish'd Reputation he never swore an Oath nor told a Lie in all his Life He is grateful to his Benefactors faithful to his Friends liberal to his Dependants and dutiful to his Superiors he values not your Money more than the Dust under his Feet but he hates to be abus'd Once for all Mrs  Mynx  leave off talking of my Husband or I will pull out these Saucer Eyes of yours and make that redstreak CountryFace look as raw as an Ox Cheek upon a Butcher's Stall remember I say that there are  Pillories and Duckingstools  With this away she flung leaving Mrs  Bull  no time to reply No Stone was left unturn  d to fright  John  from this Composition Sometimes they spread Reports at Coffeehouses that  John  and his Wife were ran mad t  t they intended to give up House and make over all the Estate to Old  Lewis Baboon  that  John  had been often talking to himself and seen in the Streets without Shoes or Stockings That he did nothing from Morning to Night but beat his Servants after having been the best Master alive as for his Wife she was a meer Natural Sometimes  John  's House was beset with a whole Regiment of Attorneys Clerks Bailiffs Followers and other small retainers of the Law who threw Stones at his Windows and Dirt at himself as he went along the Street When  John  complain'd of want of ready Money to carry on his Suit they advis'd him to pawn his Plate and Jewels and that Mrs  Bull  should sell her Linnnen and Wearing Cloaths  CHAP XIII How the Lawyers agreed to send Don Diego Dismallo the Conjurer to John Bull▪ to diswade him from making an end of his Law Suit and what pass'd between them  Bull  HOw does my good Friend  Don Diego  Don  Never worse Who can be easie when their Friends are playing the Fool  Bull  But then you may be easie for I am resolv'd to play the Fool no longer I wish I had hearken'd to your Advice and compounded this Law Suit sooner  Don  It is true I was then against the ruinous ways of this Law Suit but looking over my Scheme since I find there is an Error in my Calculation  Sol  and  Jupiter  were in a wrong House but I have now discover'd their true Places I tell you I find that the Stars are unanimously of Opinion that you will be successful in this Cause That  Lewis  will come to an untimely  and  Strutt  will be turn'd out of Doors by his Wife and Children Then he went on with a Torrent of Eclypticks Cycles Epicycles Ascendants Trines Quadrants Conjunctions Bulls Bears Goats and Rams and abundance of hard Words which being put together signify'd nothing  John  all this while stood gaping and staring like a Man in a Trance  FINIS
