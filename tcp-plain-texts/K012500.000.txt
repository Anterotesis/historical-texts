 SACRED DRAMAS CHIEFLY INTENDED FOR YOUNG PERSONS THE SUBJECTS TAKEN FROM THE BIBLE TO WHICH IS ADDED SENSIBILITY A POEM  All the Books of the BIBLE are either most admirable and exalted Pieces of Poetry or are the best materials in the world for it  COWLEY  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND  M DCC LXXXII  TO HER GRACE THE DUCHESS OF BEAUFORT THESE SACRED DRAMAS ARE WITH THE MOST PERFECT RESPECT INSCRIBED AS AMONG THE MANY AMIABLE AND DISTINGUISHED QUALITIES WHICH ADORN HER MIND AND ADD LUSTRE TO HER RANK HER EXCELLENCE IN THE MATERNAL CHARACTER GIVES A PECULIAR PROPRIETY TO HER PROTECTION OF THIS LITTLE WORK WRITTEN WITH AN HUMBLE WISH TO PROMOTE THE LOVE OF PIETY AND VIRTUE IN YOUNG PERSONS BY HER GRACE'S MOST OBEDIENT MOST OBLIGED AND MOST HUMBLE SERVANT  H MORE  ADVERTISEMENT  I AM as ready as the most rigid Critic to confess that nothing can be more simple and inartificial than the plans of the following Dramas In the construction of them I have seldom ventured to introduce any persons  Never indeed except in DANIEL and that of necessity as the Bible furnishes no more than two persons Daniel and Darius and these were not sufficient to carry on the business of the Piece  of my own creation Still less did I imagine myself at liberty to invent circumstances I reflected with awe that  the place whereon I stood was holy ground  All the latitude I permitted myself was to  make such persons as I selected act under such circumstances as I found and express such sentiments as in my humble judgment appeared not unnatural to their situations Some of the speeches are so long as to retard the action for I rather aspired after moral instruction than the purity of Dramatic Composition The very terms of Act and Scene are avoided because I was unwilling to awaken the attention of the Reader to my deficiencies in critical exactness  It may be thought that I have chosen perhaps the least important passage in the eventful Life of David for the foundation of the Drama which bears his name Yet even in this his first exploit the sacred Historian represents him as exhibiting no mean lesson of modesty humility courage  and piety virtues not only admirable but imitable and within the reach of every Reader Many will think that the introduction of Saul's daughter would have added to the effect of the piece and I have no doubt but that it would have made the intrigue more complicated and more interesting had this Drama been intended for the Stage There all that is tender and all that is terrible in the passions find a proper place But I write for the Young in whom it will be always time enough to have them awakened I write for a class of Readers to whom it is not easy to accommodate one's subject  It would not be easy I believe to introduce Sacred Tragedies on the English Stage The scrupulous would think it profane while the profane would think it dull Yet the excellent RACINE in a dissipated country and a voluptuous court ventured to adapt the story of  Athaliah  to the French Theatre and it remains to us a glorious monument of its Author's courageous piety and of the perfection of the Dramatic Art  A very judicious and learned friend has remarked that the  Reflections of King Hezekiah  breathe rather too much of the spirit of Christianity for that it is scarcely probable he had so settled a belief in the general judgment I feel the justness of the objection without having been able to obviate it I wished to convey a strong idea of this great leading truth and have perhaps improperly ascribed sentiments to a Jewish monarch merely because I wished to impress them on the Christian Reader  The Critic and the Scholar if any such should honour these pages with their attention  will find ample matter on which to exercise their candor and their charity qualities so natural to genius and to learning that even the feebleness of my performance will not be able to obstruct the exertion of them in favour of my intention  The amiable Poet  Cowley  from whom I have taken my motto after shewing the superiority of the Sacred over the Profane Histories some instances of which I have noticed in my Introduction concludes with the following remark which I may apply to myself with more propriety than it was used by the Author  I am far from assuming to myself to have fulfilled the duty of this weighty undertaking and I shall be ambitious  of no other fruit from this weak and imperfect attempt of mine but the opening of a way to the courage and industry of some other persons who may be better able to perform it thoroughly and successfully  CONTENTS  THE INTRODUCTION Page  MOSES Page  DAVID AND GOLIATH Page  BELSHAZZAR Page  DANIEL Page  HEZEKIAH Page  SENSIBILITY Page  THE INTRODUCTION  O For the sacred energy which struck  The harp of Jesse's son or for a spark  Of that celestial flame which touch'd the lips  Of bless'd Isaiah  Isaiah chap vi  when the Seraphim  With living fire descended and his soul  From sin's pollution purg'd or one faint ray  If human things to heavenly I may join  Of that pure spirit which inflam'd the breast  Of Milton God's own poet when retir'd  In fair enthusiastic vision rapt  The  nightly visitant  deign'd bless his couch  With inspiration such as never flow'd  From Aganippe's fount or Acidale  Then when the sacred fire within him burnt  He spake as man or angel might have spoke  When man was pure and Angels were his guests  It will not beNor prophet's burning zeal  Nor muse of fire nor yet to sweep the strings  With sacred energy to me belongs  Nor with Miltonic hand to touch the chords  That wake to ecstacy From me alas  The secret source of harmony is hid  The magic powers which catch the ravish'd soul  In melody's sweet maze and the clear streams  Which to pure Fancy's yet untasted springs  Enchanted lead Of these I nothing know  Yet all unknowing dare invoke thy aid  Spirit of Truth who graciously hast said  That none who ask in faith should ask in vain  You I invoke not now ye fabled nine  I not invoke you though you well were sought  In Greece and Latium by immortal bards  Whose syren song enchants and shall enchant  Thro' Time's widecircling round tho' false their faith  And less than human were the gods they sung  Tho' false their faith they taught the best they knew  And blush O Christians liv'd above their faith  They wou'd have bless'd the beam and hail'd the day  Which chas'd the moral darkness from their souls  Oh had their minds receiv'd the clearer ray  Of true devotion they had learn'd to scorn  Their deities impure their senseless gods  And wild mythology's fantastic maze  Pure PLATO how had thy chaste spirit hail'd  A faith so fitted to thy moral sense  What hadst thou felt to see the fair romance  Of high imagination the bright dream  Of thy pure fancy more than realiz'd  O sweet enthusiast thou hadst blest a scheme  Fair good and perfect How had thy rapt soul  Caught fire and burnt with a diviner flame  For ev'n thy fair idea ne'er conceiv'd  Such plenitude of love such boundless bliss  As Deity made visible to sense  Unhappy BRUTUS philosophic mind  Great 'midst the errors of the Stoic school  How had his kindling spirit joy'd to find  That his lov'd virtue was no empty name  Nor had he met the vision at Philippi  Nor had he sheath'd his bloody dagger's point  Or in the breast he lov'd or in his own  The Pagan page how far more wise than ours  They with the gods they worshipp'd grac'd their song  Our song we grace with gods we disbelieve  The manners we adopt without the creed  Shall Fiction only raise poetic flame  And shall no altars blaze O TRUTH to thee  Shall falsehood only please and fable charm  And shall eternal Truth neglected lie  Because immortal slighted or profan'd  Truth has our rev'rence only not our love  Our praise but not our heart A deity  Confess'd but shunn'd acknowledg'd not ador'd  She comes too near us and she shines too bright  Her penetrating beam at once betrays  What we wou'd hide from others and ourselves  Why shun to make our duty our delight  Let  pleasure  be the motive and allow  That immortality be quite forgot  Where shall we trace thro' all the page profane  A livelier pleasure and a purer source  Of innocent delight than the fair book  Of holy Truth presents For ardent youth  The sprightly narrative for years mature  The moral document in sober robe  Of grave philosophy array'd which all  Had heard with admiration had embrac'd  With rapture had the shades of Academe  Or the learn'd Porch produc'd it Then O then  How Wisdom's hidden treasures had been couch'd  Beneath fair Allegory's graceful veil  Do not the pow'rs of soulenchanting song  Strong imag'ry bold figure every charm  Of eastern flight sublime apt metaphor  And all the graces in thy lovely train  Divine Simplicity assemble all  In Sion's songs and bold Isaiah's strain  Why shou'd the classic eye delight to trace  How Pyrrha and the fam'd Thessalian  Deucalion  king  Restor'd the ruin'd race of lost mankind  Yet turn incurious from the patriarch sav'd  The righteous remnant of a delug'd world  Why are we taught delighted to recount  Alcides' labours yet neglect to learn  How mighty Sampson led a life of toil  Herculean Pain and peril mark'd them both  A life eventful and disastrous death  Can all the tales which Grecian records yield  Can all the names the Roman page records  Renown'd for friendship and surpassing love  Can gallant Theseus and his brave compeer  Orestes and the partner of his toils  Achates and his friend Euryalus  And blooming Nisus pleasant in their lives  And undivided by the stroke of death  Can each can all a lovelier picture yield  Of virtuous friendship can they all present  A tenderness more touching than the love  Of Jonathan and DavidSpeak ye young  You who are undebauch'd by fashion's lore  And unsophisticate from nature judge  Say is your quick attention stronger drawn  By wasted Thebes than Pharaoh's smitten hosts  Or do the vagrant Trojans yield a theme  More grateful to the eager appetite  Of young impatience than the wand'ring tribes  By Moses thro' the thirsty desert led  The beauteous  Iphigenia  Maid tho' tender is the tale  Whose guiltless blood on Aulis' altars stream'd  Smites not the bosom with a softer pang  Than Jephthah's daughter doom'd like her to die  Such are the lovely themes which court the muse  Scarce yet essay'd in verse O let me mourn  That heav'ndescended song shou'd e'er forget  Its sacred dignity and high descent  Shou'd e'er so far its origin debase  To spread corruption's bane to lull the bad  With flattery's opiate strain to taint the heart  Of innocence and silently infuse  Delicious poison whose insidious charm  Feeds the sick mind and fondly ministers  Unwholesome pleasure to the fever'd taste  While its fell venom with malignant pow'r  Strikes at the root of virtue with'ring all  Her vital energy Oh for some balm  Of sov'reign pow'r to raise the drooping muse  To all the health of virtue to infuse  A gen'rous warmth to rouse an holy pride  And give her high conceptions of herself  For me eternal Spirit let thy word  My path illume O thou compassionate God  Thou know'st our frame thou know'st we are but dust  From dust a Seraph's zeal thou wilt not ask  An Angel's purity Oh as I strive  Tho' with a feeble voice and flagging wing  A glowing heart but pow'rless hand to tell  The faith of favour'd man to heav'n to trace  The ways inscrutable of heav'n to man  May I by thy celestial guidance led  Fix deeper in my heart the truths I sing  In my own life transcribe whate'er of good  To others I propose and by thy rule  Correct th' irregular  What in me is dark  Illumine what is low raise and support  PARADISE LOST  reform the wrong  Exalt the low and brighten the obscure  Still may I note how all th' agreeing parts  Of this wellorder'd fabric join to frame  One fair one finish'd one harmonious whole  Trace the close links which form the perfect chain  In beautiful connexion mark the scale  Whose nice gradations with progression true  For ever rising end in Deity  MOSES IN THE BULRUSHES A SACRED DRAMA  I

PHARAOH's daughter and other Attendants  SCENE on the Banks of the NILE  ☞ The subject is taken from the Second Chapter of the Book of Exodus  MOSES IN THE BULRUSHES  PART I  JOCHÈBED MIRIAM  JOCHÈBED  WHY was my pray'r accepted why did heav'n  In anger hear me when I ask'd a son  Ye dames of Egypt happy happy mothers  No tyrant robs you of your fondest hopes  You are not doom'd to see the babes you bore  The babes you nurture bleed before your eyes  You taste the transports of maternal love  And never know its anguish Happy mothers  How diff'rent is the lot of thy sad daughters  O wretched Israel Was it then for this  Was it for this the righteous arm of GOD  Rescued his chosen people from the jaws  Of cruel want by pious Joseph's care  Joseph th' elected instrument of heav'n  Decreed to save illustrious Abraham's race  What time the famine rag'd in Canaan's land  Israel who then was spar'd must perish now  Oh thou mysterious pow'r who hast involv'd  Thy wise decrees in darkness to perplex  The pride of human wisdom to confound  The daring scrutiny and prove the faith  Of thy presuming creatures clear this doubt  Teach me to trace this maze of Providence  Why save the fathers if the sons must perish  MIRIAM  Ah me my mother whence these floods of grief  JOCHÈBED  My son my son I cannot speak the rest  Ye who have sons can only know my fondness  Ye who have lost them or who fear to lose  Can only know my pangs none else can guess them  A mother's sorrows cannot be conceiv'd  But by a motherWherefore am I one  MIRIAM  With many pray'rs thou didst request this son  And heav'n has granted him  JOCHÈBED  O sad estate  Of human wretchedness so weak is man  So ignorant and blind that did not GOD  Sometimes withhold in mercy what we ask  We shou'd be ruin'd at our own request  Too well thou know'st my child the stern decree  Of Egypt's cruel king hardhearted Pharaoh  "That ev'ry male of Hebrew mother born  "Must die" Oh do I live to tell it thee  Must die a bloody death My child my son  My youngest born my darling must be slain  MIRIAM  The helpless innocent and must he die  JOCHÈBED  No if a mother's tears a mother's pray'rs  A mother's fond precautions can prevail  He shall not die I have a thought my Miriam  And sure the GOD of mercies who inspir'd  Will bless the secret purpose of my soul  To save his precious life  MIRIAM  Hop'st thou that Pharaoh  JOCHÈBED  I have no hope in Pharaoh much in GOD  Much in the ROCK OF AGES  MIRIAM  Think O think  What perils thou already hast incurr'd  And shun the greater which may yet remain  Three months three dang'rous months thou hast preserv'd  Thy infant's life and in thy house conceal'd him  Shou'd Pharaoh know  JOCHÈBED  Oh let the tyrant know  And feel what he inflicts Yes hear me Heav'n  Send thy right aiming thunderboltsBut hush  My impious murmurs Is it not thy will  Thou infinite in mercy Thou permitt'st  This seeming evil for some latent good  Yes I will laud thy grace and bless thy goodness  For what I have and not arraign thy wisdom  For what I fear to lose Oh I will bless thee  That Aaron will be spar'd that my firstborn  Lives safe and undisturb'd that he was giv'n me  Before this impious persecution rag'd  MIRIAM  And yet who knows but the fell tyrant's rage  May reach his precious life  JOCHÈBED  I fear for him  For thee for all A doating parent lives  In many lives thro' many a nerve she feels  From child to child the quick affections spread  For ever wand'ring yet for ever fix'd  Nor does division weaken nor the force  Of constant operation e'er exhaust  Parental love All other passions change  With changing circumstances rise or fall  Dependant on their object claim returns  Live on reciprocation and expire  Unfed by hope A mother's fondness reigns  Without a rival and without an end  MIRIAM  But say what Heav'n inspires to save thy son  JOCHÈBED  Since the dear fatal morn which gave him birth  I have revolv'd in my distracted mind  Each means to save his life and many a thought  Which fondness prompted prudence has oppos'd  As perilous and rash With these poor hands  I've fram'd a little ark of slender reeds  With pitch and slime I have secur'd the sides  In this frail cradle I intend to lay  My little helpless infant and expose him  Upon the banks of Nile  MIRIAM  'Tis full of danger  JOCHÈBED  'Tis danger to expose and death to keep him  MIRIAM  Yet Oh reflect Shou'd the fierce crocodile  The native and the tyrant of the NILE  Seize the defenceless infant  JOCHÈBED  Oh forbear  Spare my fond heart Yet not the crocodile  Nor all the deadly monsters of the deep  To me are half so terrible as PHARAOH  That heathen king that royal murderer  MIRIAM  Shou'd he escape which yet I dare not hope  Each seabr  n monster yet the winds and waves  He cannot 'scape  JOCHÈBED  Know GOD is ev'ry where  Not to one narrow partial spot confin'd  No not to chosen ISRAEL He extends  Thro' all the vast infinitude of space  At his command the furious tempests rise  The blasting of the breath of his displeasure  He tells the world of waters when to roar  And at his bidding winds and seas are calm  In HIM not in an arm of flesh I trust  In HIM whose promise never yet has fail'd  I place my confidence  MIRIAM  What must I do  Command thy daughter for thy words have wak'd  An holy boldness in my youthful breast  JOCHÈBED  Go then my MIRIAM go and take the infant  Buried in harmless slumbers there he lies  Let me not see himspare my heart that pang  Yet sure one little look may be indulg'd  One kissperhaps the last No more my soul  That fondness wou'd be fatalI shou'd keep him  I cou'd not doom to death the babe I clasp'd  Did ever mother kill her sleeping boy  I dare not hazard itThe task be thine  Oh do not wake my child remove him softly  And gently lay him on the river's brink  MIRIAM  Did those magicians whom the sons of EGYPT  Consult and think all potent join their skill  And was it great as EGYPT's sons believe  Yet all their secret wizard arts combin'd  To save this little ark of Bulrushes  Thus fearfully expos'd cou'd not effect it  Their spells their incantations and dire charms  Cou'd not preserve it  JOCHÈBED  Know this ark is charm'd  With spells which impious EGYPT never knew  With invocations to the living GOD  I twisted every slender reed together  And with a pray'r did every ozier weave  MIRIAM  I go  JOCHÈBED  Yet e'er thou go'st observe me well  When thou hast laid him in his watry bed  O leave him not but at a distance wait  And mark what Heaven's high will determines for him  Lay him among the flags on yonder beach  Just where the royal gardens meet the Nile  I dare not follow him Suspicion's eye  Wou'd note my wild demeanor Miriam yes  The mother's fondness wou'd

acts of mercy  MIRIAM  behind  A thousand blessings on her princely head  PRINCESS  Too much the sons of Jacob have endur'd  From royal Pharaoh's unrelenting hate  Too much our house has crush'd their alien race  Is't not enough that cruel taskmasters  Grind them by hard oppression and stern bondage  Is't not enough my father owes his greatness  His palaces his fanes magnificent  Those structures which the world with wonder views  To the hard toils of much insulted Israel  To them his growing cities owe their splendor  Their labours built fair Rameses and Pythom  And now at length his still increasing rage  To iron bondage adds the guilt of murder  And shall this little helpless infant perish  Forbid it justice and forbid it heav'n  IANTHE  I know thy royal father fears the strength  Of this still growing race who flourish more  The more they are oppress'd he dreads their numbers  PRINCESS  Apis forbid Pharaoh afraid of Israel  Yet shou'd this outcast race this hapless people  E'er grow to such a formidable greatness  Which all the gods avert whom Egypt worships  This infant's life can never serve their cause  Nor can this single death prevent their greatness  IANTHE  I know not that by weakest instruments  Sometimes are great events produc'd this child  Perhaps may live to serve his upstart race  More than an host  PRINCESS  How ill does it beseem  Thy tender years and gentle womanhood  To steel thy breast to Pity's sacred touch  So weak so unprotected is our sex  So constantly expos'd so very helpless  That did not Heav'n itself enjoin compassion  Yet human policy

shall my son be nurtur'd in a court  In princely grandeur bred taught every art  And every wond'rous science Egypt knows  Yet ah I tremble Miriam shou'd he learn  With Egypt's polish'd arts her baneful faith  O worse exchange for death Yes shou'd he learn  In yon' proud palace to disown  his  hand  Who thus has sav'd him shou'd he e'er embrace  As sure he will if bred in Pharaoh's court  The gross idolatries which Egypt owns  Her graven images her brutish gods  Then shall I wish he had not been preserv'd  To shame his fathers and deny his faith  MIRIAM  Then to dispel thy sears and crown

shield of Faith  And with the helmet of salvation crown'd  Inur'd to watching and dispos'd to pray'r  Then may I send him to a dangerous court  And safely trust him in a perilous world  Too full of tempting snares and fond delusions  MIRIAM  May bounteous Heav'n thy pious cares reward  JOCHÈBED  O Amram O my husband when thou com'st  Wearied at night to rest thee from the toils  Impos'd by haughty Pharaoh what a tale  Have I to tell thee yesthy darling son  Was lost and is restor'd was dead and lives  MIRIAM  How joyful shall we spend the livelong night  In praises to JEHOVAH who thus mocks  All human foresight and converts the means  Of seeming ruin into great deliverance  JOCHÈBED  Had not my child been doom'd to such strange perils  As a fond mother trembles to recal  He had not been preserv'd  MIRIAM  And mark still farther  Had he been sav'd by any other hand  He had been still expos'd to equal ruin  JOCHÈBED  Then let us join to bless the hand of Heaven  That this poor outcast of the house of Israel  Condemn'd to die by Pharaoh kept in secret  By my advent'rous fondness then expos'd  Ev'n by that very fondness which preserv'd him  Is now to fill the wondrous round

humble are secure  II  Teach me to bless my lowly lot  Confin'd to this paternal cot  Remote from regal state  Content to court the cooling glade  Inhale the breeze enjoy the shade  And love my humble fate  III  No anxious vigils here I keep  No dreams of gold distract my sleep  Nor lead my heart astray  Nor blasting Envy's tainted gale  Pollutes the pleasures of the vale  To vex my harmless day  IV  Yon' tow'r which rears its head so high  And bids defiance to the sky  Invites the hostile winds  Yon' branching oak extending wide  Provokes destruction by its pride  And courts the fall it finds  V  Then let me shun th' ambitious deed  And all the dangerous paths which lead  To honours falsely won  Lord in thy sure protection blest  Submissive will I ever rest  And may thy will be done  He lays down his harp and rises  DAVID  This shepherd's life were dull and tasteless all  Without the charm of soothing song or harp  With it not undelightful is the haunt  Of wood or lonely grove or russet plain  Made vocal by the muse With this lov'd harp  This daily solace of my cares I sooth'd  The melancholy monarch when he lay  Smit by the chill and spiritquenching hand  Of blank despair God of my fathers hear me  Here I devote my harp my verse myself  To thy blest service gladly to proclaim  Glory to God on high on earth goodwill  To man to pour my grateful soul before thee  To sing thy pow'r thy wisdom and thy love  And every gracious attribute to paint  The charms of heav'nborn virtue So shall I  Tho' with long interval of worth aspire  To imitate the work of saints above  Of Cherub and of Seraphim My heart  My talents all I am and all I have  Is thine O Father Gracious Lord accept  The humble dedication Offer'd gifts  Of slaughter'd bulls and goats sacrifical  Thou hast refus'd but lo I come O Lord  To do thy will the living sacrifice  Of an obedient heart I lay before thee  This humble offering more shall please Thee Lord  Than horned bullocks ceremonial rites  New moons appointed passovers and fasts  Yet those I too will keep but not instead  Of holiness substantial inward worth  As commutation cheap for pious deeds  And purity of life But as the types  Of better things as fair external signs  Of inward holiness and secret truth  But sec my father good old Jesse comes  To cheer the setting evening of whose life  Content a simple shepherd here I dwell  Tho' Israel is in arms and royal Saul  Encamp'd in yonder field defies Philistia  JESSE DAVID  JESSE  Blest be the gracious Pow'r who gave my age  To boast a son like thee Thou art the staff  Which props my bending years and makes me bear  The heavy burthen of declining age  With fond complacence How unlike thy fate  O venerable Eli But two sons  But only two to gild the dim remains  Of life's departing day and bless thy age  And both were curses to thee Witness Heav'n  In all the tedious catalogue of pains  Humanity turns o'er if there be one  So terrible to human tenderness  As an unnatural child  DAVID  O my lov'd father  Long may'st thou live in years and honours rich  To taste and to communicate the joys  The thousand fond endearing charities  Of tenderness domestic Nature's best  And loveliest gift with which she well atones  The niggard boon of fortune  JESSE  O my son  Of all the graces which adorn thy youth  I with a father's fondness must commend  Thy tried humility For tho' the Seer  Pour'd on thy chosen head the sacred oil  In sign of future greatness in sure pledge  Of highest dignity yet here thou dwell'st  Content with toil and careless of repose  And harder still for an ingenuous mind  Content to be obscure content to watch  With careful eye thine humble father's flock  O earthly emblem of celestial things  So Israel's shepherd watches o'er his fold  The weak ones in his fost'ring bosom bears  And gently leads in his sustaining hand  The feeble ones with young  DAVID  Know'st thou my father  Ought from the field for tho' so near the camp  Tho' war's proud ensigns stream on yonder plain  And all Philistia's swarming hosts encamp  Oppos'd to royal Saul beneath whose banners  My brothers lift the spear I have not left  My fleecy charge by thee committed to me  To learn the present fortune of the war  JESSE  And wisely hast thou done Thrice happy land  Who shall submit one day to his command  Who can so well obey Obedience leads  To certain honours Not the tow'ring wing  Of eagleplum'd ambition mounts so surely  To Fortune's highest summit as obedience  A distant sound of trumpets  But why that sudden ardour O my son  That trumpet's sound tho' so remote its voice  We hardly catch the echo as it dies  Has rous'd the mantling blood in thy young cheek  Kindled the martial spirit in thine eye  And my young shepherd feels an hero's fire  DAVID  Thou hast not told the posture of the war  And much my beating bosom pants to hear  JESSE  Uncertain is the fortune of the field  I tremble for thy brothers thus expos'd  To constant peril nor for them alone  Does the quick feeling agonize my heart  I too lament that desolating war  Hangs his fell banner o'er my native land  Belov'd Jerusalem O war what art thou  After the brightest conquest what remains  Of all thy glories For the vanquish'd chains  For the proud victor what Alas to reign  O'er desolated nations a drear waste  By one man's crime by one man's lust of pow'r  Unpeopled Naked plains and ravag'd fields  Succeed to smiling harvests and the fruits  Of peaceful olive luscious fig and vine  Here risled temples are the cavern'd dens  Of savage beasts or haunt of birds obscene  There populous cities blacken in the sun  And in the gen'ral wreck proud palaces  Lie undistinguish'd save by the dun smoke  Of recent conflagration When the song  Of dearbought joy with many a triumph swell'd  Salutes the victor's ear and sooths his pride  How is the grateful harmony profaned  With the sad dissonance of virgins' cries  Who mourn their brothers slain Of matrons hoar  Who clasp their wither'd hands and fondly ask  With iteration shrill their slaughter'd sons  How is the laurel's verdure stain'd with blood  And soil'd with widows' tears  DAVID  Thrice mournful truth  Yet when our country's rights her sacred laws  Her holy faith are scorn'd and trampled on  Then then religion calls then GOD himself  Commands us to defend his injur'd name  'Twere then inglorious weakness mean self love  To lie inactive when the stirring voice  Of the shrill trumpet wakes to desp'rate deeds  Nor with heroic valour boldly dare  Th' idolatrous heathen bands ev'n to the death  JESSE  GOD and thy country claim the life they gave  No other cause can sanctify resentment  DAVID  Sure virtuous friendship is a noble cause  O were the princely Jonathan in danger  How wou'd I die wellpleas'd in his desence  When 'twas long since then but a stripling boy  I made short sojourn in his father's palace  At first to sooth his troubled mind with song  His armourbearer next I well remember  The gracious bounties of the gallant prince  How wou'd he sit attentive to my strain  While to my harp I sung the harmless joys  Which crown a shepherd's life How wou'd he cry  Bless'd youth far happier in thy native worth  Far richer in the talent Heav'n has lent thee  Than if a crown hung o'er thy anxious brow  The jealous monarch mark'd our growing friendship  And as my favour grew with those about him  His royal bounty lessen'd till at length  For Bethl'hem's safer shades I left the court  Nor wou'd these alter'd features now be known  Grown into manly strength nor this chang'd form  Enlarg'd with age and clad in russet weed  JESSE  I have employment for thee my lov'd son  Will please thy active spirit Go my boy  Haste to the field of war to yonder camp  Where in the vale of Elah mighty Saul  Commands the hosts of Israel Greet thy brothers  Observe their deeds note their demeanor well  And mark if wisdom on their actions waits  Bear to them too for well the waste of war  Will make it needful such plain healthful viands  As furnish out our frugal shepherd's board  And to the valiant captain of their host  Present such rural gifts as suit our fortune  Heap'd on the board within my tent thou'lt find them  DAVID  With joy I'll bear thy presents to my brothers  And to the valiant captain of their host  The rural gifts thy gratitude assigns him  What transport to behold the tented field  The pointed spear the blaze of shields and arms  And all the proud accoutrements of war  But oh far dearer transport wou'd it yield me  Cou'd this right arm alone avenge the cause  Of injur'd Israel and preserve the lives  Of guiltless thousands doom'd perhaps to bleed  JESSE  Let not thy youth be dazzled O my son  With deeds of bold emprize as valour only  Were virtue and the gentle arts of peace  Of truth and justice were not worth thy care  When thou shalt view the splendors of the war  The gay caparison the burnish'd shield  The plumecrown'd helmet and the glitt'ring spear  Scorn not the humble virtues of the shade  Nor think that Heav'n views only with applause  The active merit and the busy toil  Of heroes statesmen and the bustling sons  Of public care These have their just reward  In wealth in honours and the wellearn'd fame  Their high atchievements bring 'Tis in this sense  That virtue is her proper recompence  Wealth as its natural consequence will flow  From industry toil with success is crown'd  From splendid actions high renown will spring  Such is the usual course of human things  For Wisdom Infinite permits that thus  Effects to causes be proportionate  And nat'ral ends by nat'ral means atchiev'd  But in the future estimate which Heav'n  Will make of things terrestrial know my son  That no inferior recompence belongs  To the mild  passive  virtues meek Content  Heroic selfdenial nobler far  Than all th'atchievements noisy Fame reports  When her shrill trump proclaims the proud success  Which desolates the nations But on earth  These are not always fortunate because  Eternal Justice keeps them for the bliss  Of final recompence for the dread day  Of gen'ral retribution O my son  The oftentatious virtues which still press  For notice and for praise the brilliant deeds  Which live but in the eye of observation  These have their meed at once But there's a joy  To the fond votaries of Fame unknown  To hear the still small voice of conscience speak  Its whisp'ring plaudit to the silent soul  Heav'n notes the sigh afflicted Goodness heaves  Hears the low plaint by human ear unheard  And from the cheek of patient Sorrow wipes  The tear by mortal eye unseen or scorn'd  DAVID  As morning dews their grateful freshness shed  And cheer the herbage and the flow'rs renew  So do thy words a quick'ning balm infuse  And grateful sink in my delighted soul  JESSE  Go then my child and may the Gracious God  Who bless'd our fathers bless my muchlov'd son  DAVID  Farewell my father and of this be sure  That not a precept from thy honour'd lips  Shall fall by me unnoticed not one grace  One venerable virtue which adorns  Thy daily life but I with watchful care  And due observance will in mine transplant it  Exit  DAVID  JESSE  He's gone and still my aching eyes pursue  And strain their orbs still longer to behold him  Oh who can tell when I may next embrace him  Who can declare the counsels of the Lord  Or when the moment preordain'd by Heav'n  To fill his high designs may come This son  This blessing of my age is set apart  For high exploits the chosen instrument  Of alldisposing Heav'n for mighty deeds  Still I recal the day and to my mind  The scene is ever present when the Seer  Illustrious Samuel to the humble shades  Of Bethlehem came pretending sacrifice  To screen his errand from the jealous king  He sanctify'd us first me and my sons  For sanctity increas'd should still precede  Increase of dignity When he declar'd  He came commission'd from on High to find  Among the sons of Jesse Israel's king  Astonishment entranc'd my wond'ring soul  Yet was it not a wild tumultuous bliss  Such rash delight as promis'd honours yield  To light vain minds no 'twas a doubtful joy  Chastis'd by tim'rous virtue lest a gift  So splendid and so dang'rous might destroy  Him it was meant to raise My eldest born  Young Eliab tall of stature I presented  But God who judges not by outward form  But tries the heart forbad the holy prophet  To chuse my eldest born For Saul he said  Gave proof that fair proportion and the grace  Of limb or feature ill repaid the want  Of virtue All my other sons alike  By Samuel were rejected till at last  On my young boy on David's chosen head  The prophet pour'd the consecrated oil  Yet ne'er did pride elate him ne'er did scorn  For his rejected elders swell his heart  Not in such gentle charity to him  His haughtier brothers live but all he pardons  To meditation and to humble toil  To pray'r and praise devoted here he dwells  O may the Graces which adorn retreat  One day delight a court record his name  With saints and prophets dignify his race  Instruct mankind and sanctify a world  DAVID AND GOLIATH  PART II  SCENE The Camp  ELIAB ABINADAB ABNER ISRAELITES  ELIAB  STILL is th'event of this long war uncertain  Still do the adverse hosts on either side  Protract with ling'ring caution an encounter  Which must to one be fatal  ABINADAB  This descent  Thus to the very confines of our land  Proclaims the sanguine hope that fires the foe  In Ephesdammim boldly they encamp  Th' uncircumcis'd Philistines pitch their tents  On Judah's hallow'd earth  ELIAB  Full forty days  Has the insulting giant proud Goliath  The champion of Philistia fiercely challeng'd  Some Israelitish foe But who so vain  To dare such force unequal who so bent  On sure destruction to accept his terms  And rush on death beneath the giant force  Of his enorinous bulk  ABINADAB  'Tis near the time  When in th' adjacent valley which divides  Th' opposing armies he is wont to make  His daily challenge  ELIAB  Much I marvel brother  No greetings from our father reach our ears  With ease and plenty bless'd he little recks  The daily hardships which his sons endure  But see behold his darling son approaches  ABINADAB  How David here whence this unlook'd for guest  ELIAB  A spy upon our actions sent no doubt  To scan our deeds with beardless gravity  Affecting wisdom to observe each word  To magnify the venial faults of youth  And construe harmless mirth to foul offence  Enter  DAVID  DAVID  All hail my dearest brothers  ELIAB  Means thy greeting  True love or arrogant scorn  DAVID  Oh most true love  Sweet as the precious ointment which bedew'd  The sacred head of Aaron and descended  Upon his hallow'd vest so sweet my brothers  Is fond fraternal amity such love  As my touch'd bosom feels at your approach  ELIAB  Still that fine glozing speech those holy saws  And all that trick of studied sanctity  Of smoothturn'd periods and trim eloquence  Which charms thy doating father But confess  What dost thou here Is it to soothe thy pride  And gratify thy vain desire to roam  In quest of pleasures unallow'd or com'st thou  A willing spy to note thy brother's deeds  Where hast thou lest those few poor straggling sheep  More suited to thy ignorance and years  The care of those than here to wander idly  Why cam'st thou hither  DAVID  Is there not a cause  Why that displeasure kindling in thine eye  My angry brother why those taunts unkind  Not idly bent on sport not to delight  Mine eye with all this gay parade of war  To gratify a roving appetite  Or fondly to indulge a curious ear  With any tale of rumour am I come  But to approve myself a loving brother  I bring the blessing of your aged sire  With gifts of such plain cates and rural viands  As fuit his frugal fortune Tell me now  Where the bold captain of your host encamps  ELIAB  Wherefore enquire what boots it thee to know  Behold him there great Abner fam'd in arms  DAVID  I bring thee mighty Abner from my father  A simple shepherd swain in yonder vale  Such humble gists as shepherd swains bestow  ABNER  Thanks gentle youth with pleasure I receive  The grateful off'ring Why does thy quick eye  Thus wander with unsatisfied delight  DAVID  New as I am to all the trade of war  Each sound has novelty each thing I see  Attracts attention every noise I hear  Awakes confus'd emotions indistinct  Yet full of charming tumult sweet distraction  'Tis all delightful hurry Oh the joy  Of young ideas painted on the mind  In the warm glowing colours fancy spreads  On objects not yet known when all is new  And all is lovely Ah what warlike sound  Salutes my ravish'd ear  Sound of Trumpet  ABNER  'Tis the Philistine  Proclaiming by his herald through the ranks  His near approach Each morning he repeats  His challenge to our bands  DAVID  Ha what Philistine  Who is he  ELIAB  Wherefore ask for thy raw youth  And rustic ignorance 'twere fitter learn  Some rural art some secret to prevent  Contagion in thy flocks some better means  To save their fleece immaculate These mean arts  Of soft inglorious peace far better suit  Thy low obscurity than thus to seek  High things pertaining to exploits of arms  DAVID  Urg'd as I am I will not answer thee  Who conquers his own spirit O my brother  He is the only conquerorAgain  That shout mysterious Pray you tell me who  This proud Philistine is who sends defiance  To Israel's hardy chieftains  ABNER  Stranger youth  So lovely and so mild is thy demeanor  So gentle and so patient such the air  Of candor and of courage which adorns  Thy blooming features thou hast won my love  And I will tell thee  DAVID  Mighty Abner thanks  ABNER  Thrice and no more he sounds his daily rule  This man of war this champion of Philistia  Is of the sons of Anak's giantrace  Goliath is his name His fearful stature  Unparallel'd in Israel measures more  Than twice two cubits On his tow'ring head  A helm of burnish'd brass the giant wears  So pond'rous it wou'd crush the stoutest man  In all our hosts A coat of mailed armour  Guards his capacious trunk compar'd with which  'The amplest oak that spreads his rugged arms  In Bashan's groves were small About his neck  A shining corslet hangs On his vast thigh  The plaited cuirass firmly jointed stands  But who shall tell the wonders of his spear  And hope to gain belief of massive iron  Its temper'd frame not less than the broad beam  To which the busy weaver hangs his loom  Not to be wielded by a mortal hand  Save by his own An armourbearer walks  Before this mighty champion in his hand  Bearing the giant's shield Thrice every morn  His herald sounds the trumpet of defiance  Off'ring at once to end the longdrawn war  In single combat 'gainst that hardy foe  Who dares encounter him  DAVID  Say mighty Abner  What are the haughty terms of his defiance  ABNER  Proudly he stalks around th' extremest bouds  Of Elah's valley His herald sounds the note  Of offer'd battle Then the furious giant  With such a voice as from the troubled sky  In vollied thunder breaks thus sends his challenge  "Why do you set your battle in array  Ye men of Israel Wherefore waste the lives  Of needless thousands Why protract a war  Which may at once be ended Are not you  Servants to Saul your king and am not I  With triumph let me speak it a Philistine  Chuse out a man from all your armed hosts  Of courage most approv'd and I will meet him  His single arm to mine Th' event of this  Shall fix the fate of Israel and Philistia  If victory favour him then will we live  Your tributary slaves but if my arm  Be crown'd with conquest you shall then live ours  Give me a man if your effeminate bands  A man can boast Your armies I desy"  DAVID  What shall be done to him who shall subdue  This vile idolator  ABNER  He shall receive  Such ample bounties such profuse rewards  As might inflame chill age or cowardice  Were not the odds so desperate  DAVID  Say what are they  ABNER  The royal Saul has promis'd that bold hero  Who shall encounter and subdue Goliath  All dignity and favour that his house  Shall be set free from tribute and ennobled  With the first honours Israel has to give  And for the gallant conqueror himself  No less a recompence than the fair princess  Our monarch's peerless daughter  DAVID  Beauteous Michal  It is indeed a boon which kings might strive for  And has none answer'd yet this bold defiance  What all this goodly host of Israelites  GOD's own peculiar people all afraid  T' assert GOD's injur'd honour and their own  The king himself who in his early youth  Wrought deeds of fame the princely Jonathan  Not so the gallant youth Philistia fear'd  At Bozez and at Seneh  Samuel xiv  when the earth  Shook from her deep foundations to behold  The wondrous carnage of his single hand  On the uncircumcis'd When he exclaim'd  With glorious confidence"Shall numbers awe me  "GOD will protect his own with him to save  "It boots not friends by many or by few"  This was an hero Why does he delay  To meet this boaster For thy courtesy  Thrice noble Abner I am bound to thank thee  Woud'st thou complete thy gen'rous offices  I dare not ask it  ABNER  Speak thy wishes freely  My soul inclines to serve thee  DAVID  Then O Abner  Conduct me to the king There is a cause  Will justify this boldness  ELIAB  Braggard hold  ABNER  I take thee at thy word and will with speed  Conduct thee to my royal master's presence  In yonder tent the anxious monarch waits  Th' event of this day's challenge  DAVID  Noble Abner  Accept my thanks Now to thy private ear  If so thy grace permit I will unfold  My secret soul and ease my lab'ring breast  Which pants with high designs and beats for glory  DAVID AND GOLIATH  PART III  SCENE SAUL's Tent  SAUL  WHY was I made a king what I have gain'd  In envy'd greatness and uneasy pow'r  I've lost in peace of mind in virtue lost  Why did deceitful transports fire my soul  When Samuel plac'd upon my youthful brow  The crown of Israel I had known content  Nay happiness if happiness unmix'd  To mortal man were known had I still liv'd  Among the humble tents of Benjamin  A shepherd's occupation was my joy  And ev'ry guiltless day was crown'd with peace  But now a sullen cloud for ever hangs  O'er the faint sunshine of my brightest hours  Dark'ning the golden promise of the morn  I ne'er shall taste the dear domestic joys  My meanest subjects know True I have sons  Whose virtues wou'd have charm'd a private man  And drawn down blessings on their humble sire  I love their virtues too but'tis a love  Which jealousy has poison'd Jonathan  Is all a father's fondness cou'd conceive  Of amiable and goodOf that no more  He is too popular the people doat  Upon th'ingenuous graces of his youth  Curs'd popularity which makes a father  Detest the merit of a son he loves  How did their fond idolatry perforce  Rescue his sentenc'd life when doom'd by lot  To perish at Bethaven  Samuel xiv  for the breach  Of strict injunction that of all my bands  Not one that day shou'd taste of food and live  My subjects clamour at this tedious war  Yet of my num'rous armed chiefs not one  Has courage to engage this man of Gath  O for a champion bold enough to face  This giantboaster whose repeated threats  Strike thro' my inmost soul There was a time  Of that no moreI am not what I was  Shou'd valiant Jonathan accept the challenge  Twou'd but increase his favour with the people  And make the crown sit loosely on my brow  Ill cou'd my wounded spirit brook the voice  Of harsh comparison 'twixt sire and son  SAUL ABNER  ABNER  What meditation holds thee thus engag'd  O king and keeps thine active spirit bound  When busy war far others cares demands  Than ruminating thought and pale despair  SAUL  Abner draw near My weary soul sinks down  Beneath the heavy pressure of misfortune  O for that spirit which inflam'd my breast  With sudden fervor when among the seers  And holy sages my prophetic voice  Was heard attentive and th' astonish'd throng  Wond'ring exclaim'd "is Saul among the prophets"  Where's that bold arm which quell'd th' Amalekite  And nobly spar'd fierce Agag and his flocks  'Tis past the light of Israel now is quench'd  Shorn of his beams my sun of glory sets  Rise Moab Edom angry Ammon rise  Come Gaza Ashdod come let Ekron boast  And Askelon rejoice for Saulis nothing  ABNER  I bring thee news O king  SAUL  My valiant uncle  What can avail thy news A soul oppress'd  Refuses still to hear the charmer's voice  Howe'er enticingly he charm What news  Can sooth my sickly soul while Gath's fell giant  Repeats each morning to my frighten'd hosts  His daring challengenone accepting it  ABNER  It is accepted  SAUL  Ha by whom how when  What prince what gen'ral what illustrious hero  What vet'ran chief what warrior of renown  Will dare to meet the haughty foe's defiance  Speak my brave gen'ral noble Abner speak  ABNER  No prince no warrior no illustrious chief  No vet'ran hero dares accept the challenge  But what will move thy wonder mighty king  One train'd to peaceful deeds and new to arms  A simple shepherd swain  SAUL  O mockery  No more of this light tale it suits but ill  Thy bearded gravity or rather tell it  To credulous age or weak believing women  They love whate'er is marvellous and doat  On deeds prodigious and incredible  Which sober sense rejects I laugh to think  Of thy extravagance A shepherd's boy  Encounter him whom nations dread to meet  ABNER  Is valour then peculiar to high birth  If Heav'n had so decreed know scornful king  That Saul the Benjamite had never reign'd  NoGlory darts her soulpervading ray  On thrones and cottages regardless still  Of all the false chimerical distinctions  Vain human customs make  SAUL  Where is this youth  ABNER  Without thy tent he waits Such humble sweetness  Fir'd with the secret conscience of desert  Such manly bearing tempered with such softness  And so adorn'd with every outward charm  Of graceful form and feature saw I never  SAUL  Bring me the youth  ABNER  He waits thy royal pleasure  Exit  ABNER  SAUL  What must I think Abner himself is brave  And skill'd in human kind nor does he judge  So lightly to be caught by specious words  And fraud's smooth artifice without the marks  Of worth intrinsic But behold he comes  The youth too with him Justly did he praise  The candor which adorns his open brow  Reenter  ABNER  and  DAVID  DAVID  Hail mighty king  ABNER  Behold thy proffer'd champion  SAUL  Art thou the youth whose high heroic zeal  Aspires to meet the giant son of Anak  DAVID  If so the king permit  SAUL  Impossible  Why what experience has thy youth of arms  Where didst thou learn the dreadful trade of war  Beneath what hoary vet'ran hast thou serv'd  What feats atchiev'd what deeds of bold emprize  What wellrang'd phalanx and what charging hosts  What hard campaigns what sieges hast thou seen  Hast thou e'er scal'd the city's rampir'd wall  Or hurl'd the missile dart or learn'd to poise  The warrior's deathful spear The use of targe  Of helm and buckler is to thee unknown  DAVID  Arms I have never seen I nothing know  Of war's proud discipline The trumpet's clang  The shock of charging hosts the rampir'd wall  Th' embattled phalanx and the warrior spear  The use of targe and helm to me is new  My zeal for God my patriot love of Israel  And reverence for my king these are my claims  SAUL  But gentle youth thou hast no fame in arms  Renown with her shrill clarion never bore  Thy honour'd name to many a land remote  From the fair regions where Euphrates laves  Assyria's borders to the distant Nile  DAVID  True mighty king I am indeed alike  Unbless'd by Fortune and to Fame unknown  A lowly shepherdswain of Judah's tribe  But greatness ever springs from low beginnings  That very Nile thou mention'st whose broad stream  Bears fruitfulness and health thro' many a clime  From an unknown penurious scanty source  Took its first rise The forest oak which shades  Thy sultry troops in many a toilsome march  Once an unheeded acorn lay O king  Who ne'er begins can never ought atchieve  Of glorious Thou thyself wast once unknown  'Till fair occasion brought thy worth to light  Sublimer views inspire my youthful heart  Than human praise I seek to vindicate  Th' insulted honour of the God thou serv'st  ABNER  'Tis nobly said  SAUL  I love thy spirit youth  But dare not trust thy inexperienc'd arm  Against a giant's might The sight of blood  Tho' brave thou feel'st when peril is not nigh  Will pale thy ardent cheek  DAVID  Not so O king  This youthful arm has been imbru'd in blood  Tho' yet no blood of man has ever stain'd it  Thy servant's occupation is a shepherd  With jealous care I watch'd my father's flock  A brindled lion and a furious bear  Forth from the thicket rush'd upon the fold  Seiz'd a young lamb and tore their bleating spoil  Urg'd by compassion for my helpless charge  I felt a newborn vigour nerve my arm  And eager on the foaming monsters rush'd  The famish'd lion by his griesly beard  Enrag'd I caught and smote him to the ground  The panting monster struggling in my gripe  Shook terribly his bristling mane and lash'd  His own gaunt goary sides fiercely he ground  His gnashing teeth and roll'd his starting eyes  Bloodshot with agony then with a groan  That wak'd the echoes of the mountain dy'd  Nor did his grim associate 'scape my arm  Thy servant slew the lion and the bear  I kill'd them both and bore their shaggy spoils  In triumph home And shall I fear to meet  Th' uncircumcis'd Philistine No that God  Who sav'd me from the bear's destructive fang  And hungry lion's jaw will not he save me  From this Idolater  SAUL  He will he will  Go noble youth be valiant and be bless'd  The God thou serv'st will shield thee in the fight  And nerve thy arm with more than mortal strength  ABNER  So the bold Nazarite  Sampson See Judges chap xiv  a lion slew  An earnest of his victories o'er Philistia  SAUL  Go Abner see the youth be well equipp'd  With shield and spear Be it thy care to grace him  With all the fit accoutrements of war  The choicest mail from my rich armory take  And gird upon his thigh my own try'd sword  Of noblest temper'd steel  ABNER  I shall obey  DAVID  Pardon O king the coat of plaited mail  These limbs have never known it wou'd not shield  'Twou'd but encumber one who never felt  The weight of armour  SAUL  Take thy wish my son  Thy sword then and the God of Jacob guard thee  DAVID AND GOLIATH  PART IV  SCENE another Part of the Camp  DAVID  ETERNAL Justice in whose awful scale  Th'event of battle hangs Eternal Mercy  Whose universal beam illumines all  If by thy attributes I may unblam'd  Address thee Lord of glory hear me now  O teach these hands to war these arms to fight  Thou ever present help in time of need  Let thy broad mercy as a shield defend  And let thine everlasting arms support me  Then tho' the heathen rage I shall not fear  Jehovah be my buckler Mighty Lord  Thou who hast deign'd by humble instruments  To manifest the marvels of thy might  Be present with me now 'tis thine own cause  Thy wisdom will foresee thy goodness chuse  And thy omnipotence will execute  Thy high designs tho' by a seeble arm  I feel a secret impulse drive me on  And my soul springs impatient for the fight  'Tis not the heated spirits or warm blood  Of sanguine youth and yet I pant I burn  To meet th' insulting foe I thirst for glory  Yet not the fading glory of renown  The perishable praise of mortal man  DAVID ELIAB ISRAELITES  ELIAB  What do I hear thou truant thou hast dar'd  Ev'n to the awful presence of the king  Bear thy presumption  DAVID  He who fears the Lord  Shall boldly stand before the face of kings  And shall not be asham'd  ELIAB  But what wild dream  Has urg'd thee to this deed of desp'rate rashness  Thou mean'st so have I learn'd to meet Goliath  His single arm to thine  DAVID  'Tis what I mean  Ev'n on this spot each moment I expect  His wish'd approach  ELIAB  Go home return for shame  Nor madly pull destruction on thy head  Thy doating father when thy shepherd's coat  Drench'd in thy blood is brought him will lament  And rend his furrow'd cheek and silver hair  As if some mighty loss had touch'd his age  And mourn even as the partial patriarch mourn'd  When Joseph's bloody garment he receiv'd  From his less dear not less deserving sons  But whence that glitt'ring ornament which hangs  Useless upon thy thigh  DAVID  'Tis the king's gift  But thou art right it suits not me my brother  Nor sword I mean to wear nor spear to poize  Lest men shou'd say I put my trust in ought  Save an eternal shield  ELIAB  Then thou indeed  Art bent to seek thy death  DAVID  And what is death  Is it so terrible to die my brother  Or grant it terrible say is it not  Inevitable too If by eluding death  When some high duty calls us forth to die  We cou'd for ever shun it and escape  The universal lot then fond selflove  Then human prudence boldly might produce  Their finespun arguments their learn'd harangues  Their cobweb arts their phrase sophistical  Their subtile doubts and all the specious trick  Of eloquent cunning lab'ring for its end  But since howe'er protracted death will come  Why fondly study with ingenious pains  To put it offTo breathe a little longer  Is to defer our fate but not to shun it  Small gain which Wisdom with indiff'rent eye  Beholds Why wish to drink the bitter dregs  Of life's exhausted chalice whose last runnings  Ev'n at the best are vapid Why not die  If Heav'n so will in manhood's op'ning bloom  When all the flush of life is gay about us  When sprightly youth with many a newborn joy  Solicits every sense So may we then  Present a sacrifice unmeet indeed  Ah how unmeet but more acceptable  Than the world's leavings than a wornout heart  By vice enfeebled and by vain desires  Sunk and exhausted  ELIAB  Hark I hear a sound  Of multitudes approaching  DAVID  'Tis the giant  I see him not but hear his measur'd pace  ELIAB  Look where his pond'rous shield is borne before him  DAVID  Like a broad moon its ample disk protends  But soft what unknown prodigy appears  A moving mountain cas'd in polish'd brass  ELIAB    Getting behind  DAVID  How's this thou dost not tremble Thy firm joints  Betray no fear Thy accents are not broken  Thy cheek retains its red thine eye its lustre  He comes more near Dost thou not fear him now  DAVID  No  The vast colossal statue nor inspires  Respect nor fear Mere magnitude of form  Without proportion'd intellect and valour  Nor strikes my soul with rev'rence nor with awe  ELIAB  Near and more near he comes I hold it rash  To stay so near him and expose a life  Which may hereafter serve the state Farewell  Exit  GOLIATH  advances clad in complete armour One bearing his shield precedes him The opposing armies are seen at a distance drawn up on each side of the valley  GOLIATH  begins to speak before he comes on  DAVID  stands in the same place with an air of indifference    GOLIATH  Where is the mighty man of war who dares  Accept the challenge of Philistia's chief  What victorking what gen'ral drench'd in blood  Claims this high privilege What are his rights  What proud credentials does the boaster bring  To prove his claim What cities laid in ashes  What ruin'd provinces What slaughter'd realms  What heads of heroes and what hearts of kings  In battle kill'd or at his altars slain  Has he to boast Is his bright armoury  Thick set with spears and swords and coats of mail  Of vanquish'd nations by his single arm  Subdued Where is the mortal man so bold  So much a wretch so out of love with life  To dare the weight of this uplifted spear  Which never fell innoxious Yet I swear  I grudge the glory to his parting soul  To fall by this righthand 'Twill sweeten death  To know he had the honour to contend  With the dread son of Anak Latest time  From blank oblivion shall retrieve his name  Who dar'd to perish in unequal fight  With Gath's triumphant champion Come advance  Philistia's Gods to Israel's Sound my herald  Sound for the battle strait  Herald sounds the trumpet  DAVID  Behold thy foe  GOLIATH  I see him not  DAVID  Behold him here  GOLIATH  Say where  Direct my sight I do not war with boys  DAVID  I stand prepar'd thy single arm to mine  GOLIATH  Why this is mockery Minion it may chance  To cost thee dear Sport not with things above thee  But tell me who of all this num'rous host  Expects his death from me Which is the man  Whom Israel sends to meet my bold defiance  DAVID  Th' election of my sov'reign falls on me  GOLIATH  On thee on thee by Dagon 'tis too much  Thou curled Minion thou a nation's champion  'Twou'd move my mirth at any other time  But trifling's out of tune Begone light boy  And tempt me not too far  DAVID  I do defy thee  Thou foul idolater hast thou not scorn'd  The armies of the living GOD I serve  By me he will avenge upon thy head  Thy nations' sins and thine Arm'd with his name  Unshrinking I dare meet the stoutest foe  That ever bath'd his hostile spear in blood  GOLIATH  ironically  Indeed 'tis wondrous well now by my Gods  The stripling plays the orator Vain boy  Keep close to that same bloodless war of words  And thou shalt still be safe Tonguevaliant warrior  Where is thy sylvan crook with garlands hung  Of idle fieldflowers Where thy wanton harp  Thou daintyfinger'd hero better strike  Its note lascivious or the lulling lute  Touch softly than provoke the trumpet's rage  I will not stain the honour of my spear  With thy inglorious blood Shall that fair cheek  Be scarr'd with wounds unseemly Rather go  And hold fond dalliance with the Syrian maids  To wanton measures dance and let them braid  The bright luxuriance of thy golden hair  They for their lost Adonis may mistake  Thy dainty form  DAVID  Peace thou unhallow'd railer  O tell it not in Gath nor let the sound  Reach Askelon how once your slaughter'd Lords  By mighty  Judges chap xvi  Sampson found one common grave  When his broad shoulder the firm pillars heav'd  And to its base the tott'ring fabric shook  GOLIATH  Insulting boy perhaps thou hast not heard  The infamy of that inglorious day  When your weak hosts at  Samuel chap v  Ebenezer pitch'd  Their quickabandon'd tents Then when your ark  Your talisman your charm your boasted pledge  Of safety and success was tamely lost  And yet not tamely since by me 'twas won  When with this good rightarm I thinn'd your ranks  And bravely crush'd beneath a single blow  The chosen guardians of this vaunted shrine  Hophni  Commentators say that the Chaldee Paraphrase makes Goliath boast that he had killed Hophni and Phineas and taken the ark prisoner  and Phineas The fam'd ark itself  I bore to Ashdod  DAVID  I remember too  Since thou provok'st th' unwelcome truth how all  Your blushing priests beheld their idol's shame  When prostrate Dagon fell before the ark  And your frail God was shiver'd Then Philistia  Idolatrous Philistia flew for succour  To Israel's help and all her smitten nobles  Confess'd the LORD was GOD and the bless'd ark  Gladly with reverential awe restor'd  GOLIATH  By Ashdod's fane thou ly'st Now will I meet thee  Thou insectwarrior since thou dar'st me thus  Already I behold thy mangled limbs  Dissever'd each from each e'er long to feed  The fierce bloodsnuffing vulture Mark me well  Around my spear I'll twist thy shining locks  And toss in air thy head all gash'd with wounds  Thy lips yet quiv'ring with the dire convulsion  Of recent death Art thou not terrified  DAVID  No  True courage is not mov'd by breath of words  But the rash bravery of boiling blood  Impetuous knows no settled principle  A sev'rish tide it has its ebbs and flows  As spirits rise or fall as wine inflames  Or circumstances change But inborn courage  The gen'rous child of Fortitude and Faith  Holds its firm empire in the constant soul  And like the stedfast polestar never once  From the same fix'd and faithful point declines  GOLIATH  The curses of Philistia's gods be on thee  This finedrawn speech is meant to lengthen out  That little life thy words pretend to scorn  DAVID  Ha say'st thou so come on then Mark us well  Thou com'st to me with sword and spear and shield  In the dread name of Israel's GOD I come  The living LORD of HOSTS whom thou defy'st  Yet tho' no shield I bring no arms except  These five smooth stones I gather'd from the brook  With such a simple sling as shepherds use  Yet all expos'd defenceless as I am  The GOD I serve shall give thee up a prey  To my victorious arm This day I mean  To make the uncircumcised tribes confess  There is a GOD in Israel I will give thee  Spite of thy vaunted strength and giant bulk  To glut the carrion kites Nor thee alone  The mangled carcasses of your thick hosts  Shall spread the plains of Elah till Philistia  Thro' all her trembling tents and flying bands  Shall own that Judah's GOD is GOD indeed  I dare thee to the trial  GOLIATH  Follow me  In this good spear I trust  DAVID  I trust in Heaven  The God of battles stimulates my arm  And fires my soul with ardor not its own  DAVID AND GOLIATH  PART V  SCENE The Tent of SAUL  SAUL  rising from his couch  OH that I knew the black and midnight arts  Of wizard sorcery that I cou'd call  The slumb'ring spirit from the shades of hell  Or like Chaldean sages cou'd foreknow  Th' event of things unacted I might then  Anticipate my fortune How I'm fall'n  The sport of vain chimeras the weak slave  Of fear and sickly fancy coveting  To know the arts which foul diviners use  Thick blood and moping melancholy lead  To baleful Superstition that fell fiend  Whose with'ring charms blast the fair bloom of virtue  Why did my wounded pride with scorn reject  The wholesome truths which holy Samuel told me  Why drive him from my presence he might now  Raise my sunk soul and my benighted mind  Enlighten with religion's cheering ray  He dared to menace me with loss of empire  And I for that bold honesty dismiss'd him  "Another shall possess thy throne he cry'd  "A stranger" This unwelcome prophecy  Has lin'd my crown and strew'd my couch with thorns  Each ray of op'ning merit I discern  In friend or foe distracts my troubled soul  Lest he shou'd prove my rival But this morn  Ev'n my young champion lovely as he look'd  in blooming valour struck me to the soul  With jealousy's barb'd dart O jealousy  Thou ugliest fiend of hell thy deadly venom  Preys on my vitals turns the healthful hue  Of my fresh cheek to haggard sallowness  And drinks my spirit up  A flourish of trumpets shouting  c c  What sounds are those  The combat is decided Hark again  Those shouts proclaim it Now O God of Jacob  If yet thou hast not quite withdrawn from Saul  Thy light and favour prosper me this once  But Abner comes I dread to hear his tale  Fair Hope with smiling face but ling'ring foot  Has long deceiv'd me  ABNÉR  King of Israel hail  Now thou art king indeed The youth has conquer'd  Goliath's slain  SAUL  Oh

Where is my champion  Quick let me press him to my grateful heart  And pay him a king's thanks And yet who knows  This forward friend may prove an active foe  No more of thatTell me the whole brave Abner  And paint the glorious acts of my young hero  ABNER  Full in the centre of the camp they stood  Th' opposing armies rang'd on either side  In proud array The haughty Giant stalk'd  Stately across the valley Next the youth  With modest confidence advanc'd Nor pomp  Nor gay parade nor martial ornament  His graceful form adorn'd Goliath strait  With solemn state began the busy work  Of dreadful preparation In one place  His closely jointed mail an op'ning left  For air and only one the watchful youth  Mark'd that the beaver of his helm was up  Meanwhile the Giant such a blow devis'd  As wou'd have crush'd him this the youth perceiv'd  And from his welldirected sling he hurl'd  With dextrous aim a stone which sunk deep lodg'd  In the capacious forehead of the foe  Then with a cry as loud and terrible  As Lybian lions roaring for their young  Quite stunn'd the furious Giant stagger'd reel'd  And fell the mighty mass of man sell prone  With its own weight his shatter'd bulk was bruis'd  His clattering arms rung dreadful thro' the field  And the firm basis of the solid earth  Shook Chok'd with blood and dust he curs'd his gods  And dy'd blaspheming Strait the victor youth  Drew from its sheath the Giant's pond'rous sword  And from th' enormous trunk the goary head  Furious in death he sever'd The grim visage  Look'd threat'ning still and still frown'd horribly  SAUL  O

My glorious champion my deliverer welcome  How shall I speak the swelling gratitude  Of my full heart or give thee the high praise  Thy gallant deeds deserve  DAVID  O mighty king  Sweet is the breath of praise when giv'n by those  Whose own high merit claims the praise they give  But let not this one fortunate event  By Heav'n directed be ascrib'd to me  I might have fought with equal skill and courage  And not have gain'd this conquest then had shame  Harsh obloquy and foul disgrace befal'n me  But prosp'rous fortune gains the praise of valour  SAUL  I like not this In every thing superior  He soars above me  aside  Modest youth thou'rt right  And fortune as thou say'st deserves the praise  We give to human valour  DAVID  Rather say  The GOD OF HOSTS deserves it  SAUL  Tell me youth  What is thy name and what thy father's house  DAVID  My name is David Jesse is my sire  An humble Bethle'mite of Judah's tribe  SAUL  David the son of Jesse Sure that name  Has been familiar to me Nay

BELSHAZZAR  PART I  SCENE Near the Palace of BABYLON  DANIEL  and captive  JEWS  DANIEL  PARENT of life and light sole source of good  Whose tender mercies thro' the tide of time  In long successive order have sustain'd  And sav'd the sons of Israel Thou whose pow'r  Deliver'd righteous Noah from the flood  The whelming flood the grave of human kind  Oh Thou whose guardian care and outstretch'd hand  Rescued young Isaac from the listed arm  Rais'd at thy bidding to devote a son  An only son doom'd by his sire to die  Oh saving Faith by such obedience prov'd  Oh blest obedience hallow'd thus by faith  Thou who in mercy sav'dst the chosen race  In the wild desert and did'st there sustain them  By wonderworking love tho' they rebell'd  And murmur'd at the miracles that sav'd them  Oh hear thy servant Daniel hear and help  Thou whose almighty pow'r did after raise  Successive leaders to defend our race  Who sentest valiant Joshua to the field  Thy people's champion to the conq'ring field  Where the revolving planet of the night  Suspended in her radiant round was stay'd  And the bright sun arrested in his course  Stupendously stood still  CHORUS  of  JEWS  I  What ailed thee that thou stood'st still  O sun nor did thy flaming orb decline  And thou O moon in Ajalon's dark vale  Why didst thou long beyond thy period shine  II  Was it at Joshua's dread command  The leader of the Ifraelitish band  Yesat a mortal bidding both stood still  'Twas Joshua's word but 'twas JEHOVAH's will  III  What allcontrouling hand had force  To stop eternal Nature's constant course  The wand'ring moon to one fix'd spot confine  But He whose fiat bade the planets shine  DANIEL  Oh Thou who when thy discontented host  Tir'd of Jehovah's rule desir'd a king  In anger gav'st them Saul and then again  Didst wrest the regal sceptre from his hand  To give it DavidDavid best belov'd  Illustrious David Poet prophet king  Thou who didst suffer Solomon his son  To build a glorious temple to thy name  Oh hear thy servants and forgive them too  If by severe necessity compell'd  We worship herewe have no temple now  Altar or sanctuary none is left  CHORUS  of  JEWS  O Judah let thy captive sons deplore  Thy farfam'd temple is no more  Fall'n is thy sacred fane thy glory gone  Fall'n is thy temple Solomon  Ne'er did Barbaric kings behold  With all their shining gems their burnish'd gold  A fane so perfect bright and fair  For GOD himself was wont t' inhabit there  Between the Cherubim his glory stood  While the highpriest alone the dazzling splendor view'd  How fondly did the Tyrian artist strive  His name to latest time shou'd live  Such wealth the stranger wonder'd to behold  Gold were the tablets and the vases gold  Of cedar such an ample store  Exhausted Lebanon cou'd yield no more  Bending before the Ruler of the sky  Well might the royal founder cry  Fill'd with an holy dread a rev'rend fear  Will GOD in very deed inhabit here  The heav'n of heav'ns beneath his feet  Is for the bright inhabitant unmeet  Archangels prostrate wait his high commands  And will he deign to dwell in temples made with hands  DANIEL  Yes thou art ever present Pow'r supreme  Not circumscrib'd by time nor fix'd to space  Confin'd to altars nor to temples bound  In wealth in want in freedom or in chains  In dungeons or on thrones the faithful find thee  Ev'n in the burning cauldron thou wast near  To Shadrach and the holy brotherhood  The unhurt martyrs bless'd thee in the flames  They sought and found thee call'd and thou wast there  First  JEW  How chang'd our state Judah thy glory's fall'n  Thy joys for hard captivity exchang'd  And thy sad sons breathe the polluted air  Of Babylon where deities obscene  Insult the living GOD and to his servants  The priests of wretched idols made with hands  Shew contumelious scorn  DANIEL  'Tis Heav'n's high will  Second  JEW  If I forget thee O Jerusalem  If I not fondly cherish thy lov'd image  Ev'n in the giddy hour of thoughtless mirth  If I not rather view thy prostrate walls  Than haughty Babylon's imperial tow'rs  Then may my tongue refuse to frame the strains  Of sweetest harmony my rude righthand  Forget with sounds symphonious to accord  The harp of Jesse's son to Sion's songs  First  JEW  Oft on Euphrates' ever verdant banks  Where drooping willows form a mournful shade  With all the pride which prosp'rous fortunes give  And all th' unfeeling mirth of happy men  Th' insulting Babylonians ask a song  Such songs as erst in better days were sung  By Korah's sons or heav'ntaught Asaph set  To loftiest measures then our bursting hearts  Feel all their woes afresh the galling chain  Of bondage crushes then the freeborn soul  With wringing anguish from the trembling lip  Th' unfinish'd cadence falls and the big tear  While it relieves betrays the woefraught soul  For who can view Euphrates' pleasant stream  Its drooping willows and its verdant banks  And not to wounded memory recal  The piny groves of fertile Palaestine  The vales of Solyma and Jordan's stream  DANIEL  Firm faith and deep submission to high Heav'n  Will teach us to endure without a murmur  What seems so hard Think what the holy host  Of patriarchs saints and prophets have sustain'd  In the blest cause of Truth And shall not we  O men of Judah dare what these have dar'd  And boldly pass thro' the refining fire  Of fierce affliction Yes be witness Heav'n  Old as I am I will not shrink at death  Come in what shape it may if God so will  By peril to confirm and prove my faith  Oh I wou'd dare yon' den of hungry lions  Rather than pause to fill the task assign'd  By wisdom infinite Nor think I boast  Not in myself but in thy strength I trust  Spirit of God  First  JEW  Prophet thy words support  And raise our sinking souls  DANIEL  Behold yon' palace  Where proud Belshazzar keeps his wanton court  I knew it once beneath another lord  His grandsire  Nebuchadnezzar  who subdued Jehoiachin  And hither brought sad Judah's captive tribes  Together with the rich and sacred relics  Of our fam'd temple all the holy treasure  The golden vases and the sacred cups  Which grac'd in happier times the sanctuary  Second  JEW  May HE to whose blest use they were devoted  Preserve them from pollution and once more  In his own gracious time restore the temple  DANIEL  I with some favour'd youths of Jewish race  Was lodg'd in his own palace and instructed  In all the various learning of the east  But HE on whose great name our fathers call'd  Preserv'd us from the perils of a court  And warn'd us to avoid the tempting cates  Pernicious lux'ry offer'd to our taste  Fell luxury more perilous to youth  Than storms or quicksands poverty or chains  Second  JEW  He who can guard 'gainst the low baits of sense  Will find Temptation's arrows hurtless strike  Against the brazen shield of Temperance  For 'tis th'inferior appetites enthrall  The man and quench th'immortal light within him  The senses take the soul an easy prey  And sink th' imprison'd spirit into brute  DANIEL  Twice  Daniel Chap ii and iv  by the Spirit of GOD did I expound  The visions of the king his soul was touch'd  And twice did he repent and prostrate fall  Before the GOD of Daniel yet again  Pow'r flatt'ry and prosperity undid him  When from the lofty ramparts of his palace  He view'd the splendors of the royal city  That magazine of wealth which proud Euphrates  Wafts from each distant corner of the earth  When he beheld the admantine towers  The brazen gates the bulwarks of his strength  The pendent gardens art's stupendous work  The wonder of the worldThe proud Chaldean  Mad with the insolence of boundless wealth  And pow'r supreme conceiv'd himself a God  "This mighty Babylon is mine" he cried  "  My  wondrous pow'r  my  godlike arm atchiev'd it  I scorn submission own no deity  Above my own"While the blasphemer spoke  The wrath of Heav'n inflicted instant vengeance  Stripp'd him of that bright reason he abus'd  And drove him from the cheerful haunts of men  A naked wretched helpless senseless thing  Companion of the brutes his equals now  First  JEW  Nor does his impious grandson proud Belshazzar  Fall short of his offences nay he wants  The valiant spirit and the active soul  Of his progenitor for Pleasure's slave  Though bound in flow'ry setters silkysoft  Is more subdued than is the casual victim  Of furious rage and violent ambition  Ambition is a fierce but shortliv'd fire  But Pleasure with a constant flame consumes  War slays her thousands but destructive Pleasure  More fell more fatal her ten thousands slays  The young luxurious king she fondly wooes  In every shape of am'rous blandishment  With adulation smooth ensnares his soul  With love betrays him and with wine inflames  She strews her magic poppies o'er his couch  And with delicious opiates charms him down  In fatal slumbers bound Though Babylon  Is now invested by the warlike troops  Of the young Cyrus Persia's valiant prince  Who in conjunction with the Median king  Darius fam'd for conquest now prepares  To storm the city not th'impending horrors  Which ever wait a siege have power to wake  To thought or sense th'intoxicated king  DANIEL  Ev'n in this night of universal dread  A mighty army threat'ning at the gates  This very night as if in scorn of danger  The dissolute Belshazzar holds a feast  Magnificently impious meant to honour  Belus the fav'rite Babylonish idol  Lewd parasites compose his wanton court  Whose impious flatt'ries soothe his monstrous crimes  They justify his vices and extol  His boastful phrase as if he were some god  Whate'er he says they say what he commands  Implicitly they do they echo back  His blasphemies with shouts of loud acclaim  And when he wounds the tortur'd ear of Virtue  They cry All hail Belshazzar live for ever  Tonight a thousand nobles fill his hall  Princes and all the dames who grace the court  All but the virtuous queen sage Nitocris  Ah how unlike the impious king her son  She never mingles in the midnight fray  Nor crowns the guilty banquet with her presence  The royal fair is rich in every virtue  Which can adorn the queen or grace the woman  But for the wisdom of her prudent counsels  This wretched empire had been long undone  Not fam'd Semiramis Assyria's pride  Cou'd boast a brighter mind or firmer soul  Beneath the gentle reign of  Kings Chap xxv  Merodach  Her royal lord our nation tasted peace  Our captive monarch sad Jehoiachin  Grown grey in a close prison's horrid gloom  He freed from bondage brought the hoary king  To taste once more the longforgotten sweets  Of precious liberty and cheerful light  Pour'd in his wounds the lenient balm of kindness  And bless'd his settting hour of life with peace  Sound of trumpets is heard at a distance  First  JEW  That sound proclaims the banquet is begun  Second  JEW  Hark the licentious uproar grows more loud  The vaulted roof resounds with shouts of mirth  And the firm palace shakes Retire my friends  This madness is not meet for sober ears  If any of our race were found so near  'Twou'd but expose us to the rude attack  Of ribaldry obscene and impious jests  From these mad sons of Belial now inflam'd  To deeds of riot from the wanton feast  DANIEL  Here part we then but when again to meet  Who knows save Heav'n Yet O my friends I  An impulse more than human stir my breast  Rapt in prophetic  See the Prophecies of Isaiah chap xlvii and others  vision I behold  Things hid as yet from mortal sight I see  The dart of vengeance tremble in the air  E're long to pierce the impious king Ev'n now  The fierce destroying angel stalks abroad  And brandishes aloft the twoedg'd sword  Of retribution keen he soon will strike  And Babylon shall weep as Sion wept  Pass but a little while and you shall see  This queen of cities prostrate on the earth  This haughty mistress of the kneeling world  How shall she sit dishonour'd in the dust  In tarnish'd pomp and solitary woe  How shall she shroud her glories in the dark  And in opprobrious silence hide her head  Lament O virgin daughter of Chaldea  For thou shalt sall imperial queen shalt fall  No more Sidonian robes shall grace thy limbs  To purple garments sackcloth shall succeed  And sordid dust and ashes shall supply  The od'rous nard and cassia Thou who said'st  I am and there is none beside me thou  Ev'n thou imperial Babylon shalt fall  Thy glory quite eclips'd The pleasant sound  Of viol and of harp shall charm no more  Nor song of Syrian damsels shall be heard  Responsive to the lute's luxurious note  But the hoarse bittern's cry the raven's croak  The bat's fell scream the lonely owl's dull plaint  And every hideous bird with ominous shriek  Shall scare affrighted Silence from thy walls  While Desolation snatching from the hand  Of Time the scythe of ruin sits aloft  In dreadful majesty and horrid pomp  Glancing with sullen pride thy crumbling tow'rs  Thy broken battlements and columns fall'n  Then pointing to the mischiess she has made  The fiend exclaims This once was Babylon  BELSHAZZAR  PART II  SCENE  The Court of  BELSHAZZAR  The King seated

COURTIER  Sun of the world and light of kings all hail  Fourth  COURTIER  With lowest reverence such as best becomes  The humblest creatures of imperial power  Behold a thousand nobles bend before thee  Princes far fam'd and dames of high descent  Yet all this pride of wealth this boast of beauty  Shrinks into nought before thine awful eye  And lives or dies as the king frowns or smiles  BELSHAZZAR  This is such homage as becomes your love  And suits the mighty monarch of mankind  Fifth  COURTIER  The bending world shou'd prostrate thus before thee  And pay not only praise but adoration  BELSHAZZAR  Rises and comes forward  Let dull philosophy preach selfdenial  Let envious poverty and snarling age  Proudly declaim against the joys they know not  Let the deluded Jews who fondly hope  Some fancied heav'n hereafter mortify  And lose the actual blessings of this world  To purchase others which may never come  Our  Gods may promise less but give us more  Ill cou'd my ardent spirit be content  With meagre abstinence and hungry hope  Let those misjudging Israelites who want  The nimble spirits and the active soul  Call their blunt feelings virtue let them drudge  In regular progression thro' the round  Of formal duty and of daily toil  And when they want the genius to be blest  Believe their harsh austerity is goodness  If there be Gods they meant we shou'd be happy  Why give us else these appetites to be so  And why the means to crown them with indulgence  To burst the feeble bonds which hold the vulgar  Is noble daring  First  COURTIER  And is therefore worthy  The high imperial spirit of Belshazzar  Second  COURTIER  Behold a banquet which the gods might share  BELSHAZZAR  Tonight my friends your monarch shall be blest  With ev'ry various joy tonight is ours  Nor shall the envious gods who view our bliss  And sicken as they view tonight disturb us  Bring all the richest spices of the East  The od'rous cassia and the dropping myrrh  The liquid amber and the fragrant gums  Rob Gilead of its balms Belshazzar bids  And leave the Arabian groves without an odour  Bring freshest flow'rs exhaust the blooming spring  Twine the green myrtle with the shortliv'd rose  And ever as the blushing garland fades  We'll learn to snatch the fugitive delight  And grasp the flying joy ere it escape us  Comefill the smiling goblet for the king  Belshazzar will not let a moment pass  Unmark'd by some enjoyment The full bowl  Let every guest partake  Courtiers kneel and drink  First  COURTIER  Here's to the king  Light of the world and glory of the earth  Whose word is fate  BELSHAZZAR  Yes we are likest gods  When we have pow'r and use it What is wealth  But the blest means to gratify desire  I will not have a wish a hope a thought  That shall not know fruition What is empire  The privilege to punish and enjoy  To feel our pow'r in making others fear it  To taste of pleasure's cup till we grow giddy  And think ourselves immortal This is empire  My ancestors scarce tasted of its joys  Shut from the sprightly world and all its charms  In cumbrous majesty in sullen state  And dull unsocial dignity they liv'd  Far from the sight of an admiring world  That world whose gaze makes half the charms of greatness  They nothing knew of empire but the name  Or saw it in the looks of trembling slaves  And all they felt of royalty was care  But I will see and know it of myself  Youth wealth and greatness court me to be blest  And Pow'r and Pleasure draw with equal force  And sweet attraction both I will embrace  With fond delight but this is Pleasure's day  Ambition will have time to reign hereafter  It is the proper appetite of age  The lust of pow'r shall lord it uncontroul'd  When all the gen'rous feelings grow obtuse  And stern dominion holds with rigid hand  His iron rein and sits and sways alone  But youth is pleasure's hour  First  COURTIER  Perish the slave  Who with officious counsel wou'd oppose  The king's desire whose slightest wish is law  BELSHAZZAR  Now strike the loudton'd lyre and softer lute  Let me have music with the nobler aid  Of poesy Where are those cunning men  Who boast by chosen sounds and measur'd sweetness  To set the busy spirits in a flame  And cool them at their will who know the art  To call the hidden pow'rs of numbers forth  And make that pliant instrument the mind  Yield to the pow'rful sympathy of sound  Obedient to the master's artful hand  Such magic is in song Then give me song  Yet not at first such souldissolving strains  As melt the soften'd sense but such bold measures  As may inflame my spirit to despise  The ambitious Persian that presumptuous boy  Who rashly dares ev'n now invest our city  And menaces th' invincible Belshazzar  A grand  CONCERT  of  MUSIC  after which an  ODE  In vain shall Persian Cyrus dare  With great Belshazzar wage unequal war  In vain Darius shall combine  Darius leader of the Median line  While fair Euphrates' stream our walls protects  And great Belshazzar's self our fate directs  War and famine threat in vain  While this demigod shall reign  Let Persia's prostrate king confess his pow'r  And Media's monarch dread his vengeful hour  On Dura's  Daniel chap iii  ample plain behold  Immortal Belus  See a very fine description of the Temple of this Idol  The tow'ring fane  Of Bel Chaldean Jove surpassing far  That Doric Temple which the Elean chiefs  Rais'd to their thunderer from the spoils of war  Or that Ionic where th' Ephesian bow'd  To Dian queen of heaven Eight towers arise  Each above each immeasurable height  A monument at once of Eastern pride  And slavish superstition c c  JUDAH RESTOR'D Book I  whom the nations own  Sublime he stands in burnish'd gold  And richest offerings his bright altars crown  Tonight his deity we here adore  And due libations speak his mighty pow'r  Yet Belus' self not more we own  Than great Pelshazzar on Chaldea's throne  Great Belshazzar like a god  Rules the nations with a nod  To great Belshazzar be the goblet crown'd  Belshazzar's name the echoing roofs rebound  BELSHAZZAR  Enough the kindling rapture fires my brain  And my heart dances to the flatt'ring sounds  I feel myself a god Why not a god  What were the deities our fathers worshipp'd  What was great Nimrod our imperial founder  What greater Belus to whose pow'r divine  We raise tonight the banquet and the song  But youthful heroes mortal like myself  Who by their daring earn'd divinity  They were but men nay some were less than men  Tho' now rever'd as Gods What was Anubis  Whom Egypt's sapient sons adore A dog  And shall not I young valiant and a king  Dare more do more be greater than the rest  I will indulge the thoughtFill me more wine  To cherish and exalt the young idea  He drinks  Ne'er did Olympian Jupiter himself  Quaff such immortal draughts  First  COURTIER  What cou'd that Cannan  That heaven in hope that nothing in possession  That airbuilt bliss of the deluded Jews  That promis'd land of milk and flowing honey  What cou'd that fancied Paradise bestow  To match these generous juices  BELSHAZZAR  Holdenough  Thou hast rous'd a thought by Heav'n I will enjoy it  A glorious thought which will exalt to rapture  The pleasures of the banquet and bestow  A yet untasted relish of delight  First  COURTIER  What means the king  BELSHAZZAR  The Jews saidst thou the Jews  First  COURTIER  I spoke of that undone that outcast people  The tributary creatures of thy pow'r  The captives of thy will whose very breath  Hangs on the sov'reign pleasure of the king  BELSHAZZAR  When that abandon'd race was hither brought  Were not the choicest treasures of their temple  Devoted to their God and held most precious  Among the spoils which grac'd  The name of Nebuchadnezzar not being reducible to verse I have adopted that of Nebassar on the authority of the ingenious and learned Author of  Judah Restor'd  Nebassar's triumph  And lodg'd in Babylon  First  COURTIER  O king they were  Second  COURTIER  The Jews with superstitious awe behold  These sacred symbols of their ancient faith  Nor has captivity abated ought  The rev'rend love they bear these holy reliques  Tho' we deride their law and scorn their persons  Yet never have we yet to human use  Devoted these rich vessels set apart  To sacred purposes  BELSHAZZAR  I joy to hear it  Gofetch them hither They shall grace our banquet  Does no one stir Belshazzar disobey'd  And yet you live Whence comes this strange reluctance  This newborn rev'rence for the helpless Jews  This fear to injure those who can't revenge it  Send to the sacred treasury in haste  Let all be hither broughtwho answers dies  They go out  The mantling wine a higher joy will yield  Pour'd from the precious flaggons which adorn'd  Their farfam'd temple now in ashes laid  Oh 'twill exalt the pleasure into transport  To gall those whining praying Israelites  I laugh to think what wild dismay will seize them  When they shall learn the use that has been made  Of all their holy trumpery  The vessels are brought in  Second  COURTIER  It comes  A goodly shew how bright with gold and gems  Far fitter for a youthful monarch's board  Than the cold shrine of an unheeding god  BELSHAZZAR  Fill me that massy goblet to the brim  Now Abraham let thy wretched race expect  The fable of their faith to be fulfill'd  Their second temple and their promis'd king  Now will they see he's impotent to save  For had he pow'r to help he wou'd have hinder'd  This profanation  As the king is going to drink thunder is heard he starts from the throne spies a hand which writes on the wall these words  MENE MENE TEKEL UPHARSIN  He lets fall the goblet and stands in an attitude of speechless horror All start and are terrified  First  COURTIER  after a long pause  Oh transcendent horror  Second  COURTIER  What may this mean The king is greatly mov'd  Third  COURTIER  Nor is it strangewho unappall'd can view it  Those sacred cups I doubt we've gone too far  First  COURTIER  Observe the fearstruck king his starting eyes  Roll horribly Thrice he essay'd to speak  And thrice his tongue refus'd  BELSHAZZAR  in a low trembling voice  Ye mystic words  Thou semblance of an hand illusive forms  Ye dire fantastic images what are ye  Dread shadows speak Explain your horrible meaning  Ye will not answer meYes yes I feel  I am a mortal nowMy failing limbs  Refuse to bear me up I am no god  Gods do not tremble thusSupport me hold me  These loosen'djoints these knees which smite each other  Betray I'm but a mana weak one too  First  COURTIER  In truth 'tis passing strange and full of horror  BELSHAZZAR  Send for the learn'd magicians every sage  Who deals in wizard spells and magic charms  Some go out  First  COURTIER  How fares my lord the king  BELSHAZZAR  Am I a king  What pow'r have I Ye lying slaves I am not  Oh souldistracting sight but is it real  Perhaps 'tis fancy all or the wild dream  Of mad distemperature the fumes of wine  I'll look upon't no moreSonow I'm well  I am a king again and know not fear  And yet my eyes will seek that fatal spot  And fondly dwell upon the sight that blasts them  Again 'tis there it is not fancy's work  I see it still 'tis written on the wall  I see the writing but the viewless writer  Who what is he Oh horror horror horror  It cannot be the GOD of these poor Jews  For what is he that he can thus afflict  Second  COURTIER  Let not my lord the king be thus dismay'd  Third  COURTIER  Let not a phantom an illusive shade  Disturb the peace of him who rules the world  BELSHAZZAR  No more ye wretched sycophants no more  The sweetest note which flatt'ry now can strike  Harsh and discordant grates upon my soul  Talk not of power to one so full of fear  So weak so impotent Look on that wall  If thou wou'dst sooth my soul explain the writing  And thou shalt be my oracle my God  Tell me from whence it came and what it means  And I'll believe I am again a king  Friends princes ease my troubled breast and say  What do the mystic characters portend  First  COURTIER  'Tis not in us O king to ease thy spirit  We are not skill'd in those mysterious arts  Which wait the midnight studies of the sage  But of the deep diviners thou shalt learn  The wise astrologers the sage magicians  Who of events unborn take secret note

tax'd for his reward  And he himself shall name the gift he wishes  A splendid scarlet robe shall grace his limbs  His neck a princely chain of gold adorn  Meet honours for such wisdom He shall rule  The third in rank throughout our Babylon  Second  ASTROLOGER  Such recompence becomes Belshazzar's bounty  Let the king speak the secret of his soul  Which heard his humble creatures shall unfold

king forgive his faithful servants  Second  ASTROLOGER  O mitigate our threaten'd doom of death  If we declare with mingled grief and shame  We cannot tell the secret of the king  Nor what these mystic characters portend  BELSHAZZAR  Off with their heads Ye shall not live an hour  Curse on your shallow arts your lying science  'Tis thus you practise on the credulous world  Who think you wise because themselves are weak  But miscreants ye shall die the pow'r to punish  Is all that I have left me of a king  First  COURTIER  Great Sir suspend their punishment awhile  Behold sage Nitocris thy royal mother  BELSHAZZAR  My mother here  Enter  QUEEN  QUEEN  O my misguided son  Well mayst thou wonder to behold me here  For I have ever shunn'd this scene of riot  Where wild intemperance and dishonour'd mirth  Hold festival impure Yet O Belshazzar  I cou'd not hear the wonders which befel  And leave thee to the workings of despair  For spite of all the anguish of my soul  At thy offences I'm thy mother still  Against the solemn prupose I had form'd  Never to mix in this unhallow'd crowd  The wond'rous story of the mystic writing  Of strange and awful import brings me here  If haply I may shew some likely means  To fathom this dark mystery  BELSHAZZAR  Speak O queen  My list'ning soul shall hang upon thy words  And prompt obedience follow them  QUEEN  Then hear me  Among the captive tribes which hither came  To grace Nebassar's triumph there was brought  A youth nam'd Daniel favour'd by high Heav'n  With pow'r to look into the secret page  Of dim futurity's mysterious volume  The spirit of the holy Gods is in him  No vision so obscure no fate so dark  No sentence so perplex'd but he can solve it  Can trace each crooked labyrinth of thought  Each winding maze of doubt and make it clear  And palpable to sense He twice explain'd  The monarch's mystic dreams The holy seer  Saw with prophetic spirit what befel  The king long after For his wond'rous skill  He was rewarded honour'd and caress'd  And with the rulers of Chaldea rank'd  Tho' now alas thrown by his services  Forgotten or neglected such the meed  Which virtue finds in courts  BELSHAZZAR  Dispatch with speed  A message to command the holy man  To meet us on the instant  NITOCRIS  I already  Have sent to ask his presence at the palace  And lo he comes  Enter  DANIEL  BELSHAZZAR  Welcome thrice venerable sage approach  Art thou that Daniel whom my great forefather  Brought hither with the captive tribes of Judah  DANIEL  I am that Daniel  BELSHAZZAR  Pardon holy Prophet  Nor let a just resentment of thy wrongs  And long neglected merit shut thy heart  Against a king's request a suppliant king  DANIEL  The GOD I worship teaches to forgive  BELSHAZZAR  Then let thy words bring comfort to my soul  I've heard the spirit of the Gods is in thee  That thou can'st look into the fates of men  With prescience more than human  DANIEL  Hold O king  Wisdom is from above 'tis GOD's own gift  I of myself am nothing but from him  The little knowledge I possess I hold  To him be all the glory  BELSHAZZAR  Then O Daniel  If thou indeed dost boast that wond'rous gift  That faculty divine look there and tell me  O say what mean those mystic characters  Remove this load of terror from my soul  And honours such as kings can give await thee  Thou shalt be great beyond thy soul's ambition  And rich above thy wildest dream of wealth  Clad in the scarlet robe our nobles wear  And grac'd with princely ensigns thou shalt stand  Near our own throne and third within our empire  DANIEL  O mighty king thy gifts with thee remain  And let thy high rewards on others fall  The princely ensign nor the scarlet robe  Nor yet to be the third within thy realm  Can touch the soul of Daniel Honour fame  All that the world calls great thy crown itself  Cou'd never satisfy the vast ambition  Of an immortal spirit which aspires  To an eternal crown a crown of glory  First  COURTIER  Aside  Our priests teach no such notions  DANIEL  Yet O king  Tho' all unmov'd by grandeur or by gift  I will unfold the high decrees of Heav'n  And strait declare the mystery  BELSHAZZAR  Speak O Prophet  DANIEL  Prepare to hear what kings have seldom heard  Prepare to hear what these have never told thee  Prepare to hear the TRUTH The mighty GOD  Who rules the sceptres and the hearts of kings  Gave thy renown'd  Nebuchadnezzar  forefather here to reign  With such extent of empire weight of pow'r  And greatness of dominion the wide earth  Trembled beneath the terror of his name  And kingdoms stood or fell as he decreed  Oh dangerous pinnacle of pow'r supreme  Who can stand safe upon its treach'rous top  Behold the gazing prostrate world below  Whom depth and distance into pigmies shrink  And not grow giddy Babylon's great king  Forgot he was a man a helpless man  Subject to pain and sin and death like others  But who shall fight against Omnipotence  Or who hath harden'd his obdurate heart  Against the Majesty of Heav'n and prosper'd  The GOD he had insulted was aveng'd  From empire from the joys of social life  He drove him forth extinguish'd reason's lamp  Quench'd that bright spark of deity within  Compell'd him with the forest brutes to roam  For scanty pasture and the mountain dews  Fell cold and wet on his defenceless head  Till he confess'dLet men let monarchs hear  Till he confess'd PRIDE WAS NOT MADE FOR MAN  NITOCRIS  O awful instance of divine displeasure  BELSHAZZAR  Proceed My soul is wrapt in fix'd attention  DANIEL  O king thy grandsire not in vain had sinn'd  If from his error thou had'st learnt the truth  The story of his fall thou oft hast heard  But has it taught thee wisdom Thou like him  Hast been elate with pow'r and mad with pride  Like him thou hast defy'd the Living GOD  Nay to bold thoughts hast added deeds more bold  Thou hast outwrought the pattern he bequeath'd thee  And quite outgone example hast prophan'd  With impious hand the vessels of the Temple  Those vessels sanctified to holiest use  Thou hast polluted with unhallow'd lips  And made the instruments of foul debauch  Thou hast ador'd the gods of wood and stone  Vile senseless deities the work of hands  But HE THE KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS  In whom exists thy life thy soul thy breath  On whom thy being hangs thou hast deny'd  First  COURTIER  Aside to the others  With what an holy boldness he reproves him  Second  COURTIER  Such is the fearless confidence of virtue  And such the righteous courage those maintain  Who plead the cause of truth The smallest word  He utters had been death to half the court  BELSHAZZAR  Now let the mystic writing be explain'd  Thrice venerable sage  DANIEL  O mighty king  Hear then its awful import  God has number'd  Thy days of royalty  and  soon will end them  The Allwise has weigh'd thee in the even balance  Of his own holy law  and  finds thee wanting  And last  Thy kingdom shall be wrested from thee  And know  the Mede and Persian shall possess it  BELSHAZZAR  He starts up  Prophet when shall this be  DANIEL  In GOD's own time  Here my commission ends I may not utter  More than thou haft heard but O remember king  Thy days are number'd hear repent and live  BELSHAZZAR  Say Prophet what can penitence avail  If Heav'n's decrees immutably are fix'd  Can pray'rs avert our fate  DANIEL  They change our hearts  And thus dispose Omnipotence to mercy  'Tis man that alters GOD is still the same  Conditional  are all Heav'n's covenants  And when th' uplifted thunder is withheld  'Tis pray'r that deprecates th'impending bolt  Good  Chron Chap xxxii Also Isaiah Chap xxxviii  Hezekiah's days were number'd too  But penitence and tears were mighty pleas  At Mercy's throne they never plead in vain  He is going  BELSHAZZAR  Stay Prophet and receive thy promis'd gift  The scarlet robe and princely chain are thine  And let my heralds publish through the land  That Daniel stands in dignity and pow'r  The third in Babylon These just rewards  Thou well may'st claim though sad thy prophecy  QUEEN  Be not deceiv'd my son nor let thy soul  Snatch an uncertain moment's treach'rous rest  On the dread brink of that tremendous gulf  Which yawns beneath thee  DANIEL  O unhappy king  Know what  must  happen once  may  happen soon  Remember that 'tis terrible to meet  Great evils unprepar'd and O Belshazzar  In the wild moment of dismay and death  Remember thou wast warn'd and O remember  Warnings despis'd are condemnations then  Exeunt Daniel and Queen  BELSHAZZAR  'Tis wellmy soul shakes off its load of care  'Tis only the obscure is terrible  Imagination frames events unknown  In wild fantastic shapes of hideous ruin  And what it fears createsI know the worst  And awful is that worst as fear could feign  But distant are the ills I have to dread  What is remote may be uncertain too  Ha Princes hope breaks inThis may not be  First  COURTIER  Perhaps this Daniel is in league with Persia  And

stand terrified Enter soldiers with their swords drawn and wounded  SOLDIER  Oh helpless Babylon Oh wretched king  Chaldea is no more the Mede has conquer'd  The victor Cyrus like a mighty torrent  Comes rushing on and marks his way with ruin  BELSHAZZAR  Impossible Villain and slave thou ly'st  Euphrates and the brazen gates secure us  While those remain Belshazzar laughs at danger  SOLDIER

this new fav'rite Daniel reigns  And not Darius Daniel guides the springs  Which move this mighty empire High he sits  Supreme in favour both with prince and people  Where is the spirit of our Median lords  Tamely to crouch and bend the supple knee  To this new god By Mithras 'tis too much  Shall great Arbaces' race to Daniel bow  A foreigner a Hebrew and a slave  Something must be devis'd and that right soon  To shake his credit  SORANUS  Rather hope to shake  The mountain pine whose twisting fibres clasp  The earth deep rooted Rather hope to shake  The Scythian Taurus from his central base  NoDaniel sits too absolute in pow'r  Too firm in favour for the keenest shaft  Of nicelyaiming jealousy to reach him  PHARNACES  Rather he sits too high to sit securely  Hast thou then liv'd in courts hast thou grown grey  Beneath the mask a subtil statesman wears  To hide his secret soul and dost not know  That of all fickle Fortune's transient gifts  Favour is most deceitful 'Tis a beam  Which darts uncertain brightness for a moment  The faint precarious sickly shine of pow'r  Giv'n without merit by caprice withdrawn  No trisle is so small as what obtains  Save that which loses it It is a breath  Which hangs upon a smile A look a word  A frown the airbuilt tow'r of favour shakes  And down the unsubstantial fabric falls  Darius just and clement as he is  If I mistake not may be wrought upon  By prudent wiles by Flattery's pleasant cup  Administer'd with caution  SORANUS  But the means  For Daniel's life a foe must grant him that  Is so replete with goodness so adorn'd  With every virtue so exactly squar'd  By wisdom's nicest rules that 'twere most hard  To charge him with the shadow of offence  Pure is his fame as Scythia's mountain snows  When not a breath pollutes them O Pharnaces  I've scann'd the actions of his daily life  With all th' industrious malice of a foe  And nothing meets mine eye but deeds of honour  In office pure for equitable acts  Renown'd In

are written  SORANUS  Thou mistak'st  I only meant to shew what cause we have  To hate and fear him I but meant to paint  His popular virtues and his dang'rous merit  Then for devotion and religious zeal  Who so renown'd as Daniel Of his law  Observant in th' extreme Thrice ev'ry day  With prostrate rev'rence he adores his God  With superstitious awe his face he turns  Tow'rds his belov'd Jerusalem as if  Some local partial God might there be found  To hear his supplication No affair  Of state no business so importunate  No pleasure so alluring no employ  Of such high import to seduce his zeal  From this observance due  PHARNACES  There there he falls  Enough my friend His piety destroys him  There at the very footstool of his God  Where he implores protection there I'll crush him  SORANUS  What means Pharnaces  PHARNACES  Ask not what I mean  The new idea floating in my brain  Has yet receiv'd no form 'Tis yet too soon  To give it body circumstance or breath  The seeds of mighty deeds are lab'ring here  And struggling for a birth 'Tis near the hour  The king is wont to summon us to council  E'er that this big conception of my mind  I'll shape to form and being Thou meanwhile  Convene our chosen friends for I shall need  The aid of all your counsels and the weight  Of grave authority  SORANUS  Who shall be trusted  PHARNACES  With our immediate motive none except  A chosen band of friends who most repine  At Daniel's exaltation But the scheme  I meditate must be disclos'd to all  Who bear high office all our Median rulers  Princes and captains presidents and lords  All must assemble 'Tis a common cause  All but the young Araspes he inclines  To Daniel and his GOD He sits attent  With ravish'd ears to listen to his lore  With rev'rence names Jerusalem and

purity Not Ophir's gold  Nor Ethiopia's gems can match her price  The diamond of the mine is pale before her  And like the oil Elisha's bounty bless'd  She is a treasure which doth grow by use  And

prudence can suggest to serve the state  To benefit the subject to redress  And raise the injur'd to assist th' oppress'd  And humble the oppressor If you know  Speak freely princes Wherefore am I king  Except to poise the awful scale of justice  With even hand to minister to want  To bless the nations with a lib'ral rule  Vicegerent of th' eternal Oromasdes  PHARNACES  So absolute thy wisdom mighty king  All counsel were superfluous  DARIUS  Hold Pharnaces  No slatt'ry prince it is the death of virtue  Who gives it is of all mankind the lowest  Save he who takes it Monarchs are but men  As feeble and as frail as those they rule  And born like them to die The Lydian king  Unhappy Croesus lately sat aloft  Almost above mortality now see him  Sunk to the vile condition of a slave  He swells the train of Cyrus I like him  To mis'ry am obnoxious See this throne  This very throne the great  Nebuchadnezzar  Nebassar fill'd  Yet hence his pride expell'd him Yonder wall  The dread terrific writing to the eyes  Of proud Belshazzar shew'd sad monuments  Of Heav'n's tremendous vengeance and shall I  Unwarn'd by such examples cherish pride  Yet to their dire calamities I owe  The brightest gem that glistens in my crown  Sage Daniel If my speech have ought of worth  Or if my life with ought of good be grac'd  To him alone I owe it  SORANUS  Aside to Pharnaces  Now Pharnaces  Will he run o'er and dwell upon his praise  As if we ne'er had heard it nay will swell  The nauseous catalogue with many a virtue  His own fond fancy coins  PHARNACES  O great Darius  Let thine unworthy servant's words find grace  And meet acceptance in his royal ear  Who subjugates the East Let not the king  With anger hear my pray'r  DARIUS  Pharnaces speak  I know thou lov'st me I but meant to chide  Thy flatt'ry not reprove thee for thy zeal  Speak boldly friends as man shou'd speak to man  Perish the barb'rous maxims of the East  Which basely wou'd enslave the freeborn mind  And plunder it of the best gift of Heav'n  Its liberty  PHARNACES  Then O Darius hear me  Thy princes and the captains of thy bands  Thy presidents the governors who rule  Thy provinces and I thine humble creature  Less than the least in merit but in love  In zeal and duty equal with the first  We have devis'd a measure to confirm  Thy infant empire to establish here  Thy pow'r with firm dominion and secure  Thy growing greatness past the pow'r of change  DARIUS  I am prepar'd to hear thee Speak Pharnaces  PHARNACES  The wretched Babylonians long have groan'd  Beneath the rule of princes weak or rash  The rod of pow'r was falsely sway'd alike  By feeble Merodach and sierce Belshazzar  One let the slacken'd reins too loosely float  Upon the people's neck and lost his pow'r  By nerveless relaxation He who follow'd  Held with a tyrant's hand the cruel curb  And check'd the groaning nation till it bled  On diff'rent rocks they met one common ruin  Their edicts were irresolute their laws  Were feebly plann'd their councils illadvis'd  Now so relax'd and now so overstrain'd  That the tir'd people wearied with the weight  They long have borne will soon disdain controul  Tread on all rule and spurn the hand that guides 'em  DARIUS  But say what remedy Pharnaces  PHARNACES  Know that too  Thy servants have provided Hitherto  They bear the yoke submissive But to fix  Thy pow'r and their obedience to reduce  All hearts to thy dominion yet avoid  Those deeds of cruelty thy nature starts at  Thou shoud'st begin by some imperial act  Of absolute dominion yet unstain'd  By ought of barbarous For know O king  Wholesome severity if wisely rul'd  With sober discipline procures respect  More than the lenient counsels and weak measures  Of frail irresolution  DARIUS  Now proceed  To thy request  PHARNACES  Not I but all request it  Be thy imperial edict issued strait  And let a firm decree be this day pass'd  Irrevocable as our Median laws  Ordain that for the space of thirty days  No subject in thy realm shall ought request  Of God or man except of thee O king  DARIUS  Wherefore this strange decree  PHARNACES  'Twill fix the crown  With lasting safety on thy royal brow  And by a bloodless means preserve th' obedience  Of this new empire Think how much 'twill raise  Thy high renown 'Twill make thy name rever'd  And popular beyond example What  To be as Heav'n dispensing good and ill  For thirty days With thine own ears to hear  Thy people's wants with thine own lib'ral hands  To bless thy suppliant subjects O Darius  Thou'lt seem as bounteous as a giving God  And reign in ev'ry heart in Babylon  As well as Media What a glorious state  To be the blessed arbiter of good  The first efficient cause of happiness  To scatter mercies with a plenteous hand  And to be blest thyself in blessing others  DARIUS  Is this the gen'ral wish  The Princes and Courtiers kneel  Chief  PRESIDENT  Of one of all  Behold thy princes presidents and lords  Thy counsellors and captains See O king  Presenting the Edict  Behold the instrument our zeal has drawn  The edict is prepar'd We only wait  The confirmation of thy gracious word  And thy imperial signet  DARIUS  Say Pharnaces  What penalty awaits the man who dares  Transgress our mandate  PHARNACES  Instant death O king  This statute says "Shou'd any subject dare  "Petition for the space of thirty days  "Of God or man except of thee O king  "He shall be thrown into yon' dreadful den  "Of hungry lions"  DARIUS  Hold Methinks a deed  Of such importance shou'd be wifely weigh'd  PHARNACES  We have revolv'd it mighty king with care  With closest scrutiny  DARIUS  I'm satisfy'd  Then to your wisdom I commit me princes  Behold the royal signet see 'tis done  PHARNACES  Aside  There Daniel fell That signet seal'd his doom  DARIUS  After a pause  Let me reflectSure I have bee too rash  Why such intemperate haste But you are wise  And wou'd not counsel this severe decree  But for the wisest purpose Yet methinks  I might have weigh'd and in my mind revolv'd  This statute e'er the royal signet stamp'd  It had been past repeal Sage Daniel too  My counsellor my venerable friend  He shou'd have been consulted for his wisdom  I still have found oracular  PHARNACES  Mighty king  'Tis as it shou'd be The decree is past  Irrevocable as the stedfast law  Of Mede and Persian which can never change  Those who observe it live as is most meet  High in thy grace who violate it die  DANIEL  PART IV  SCENE DANIEL's House  DANIEL ARASPES  ARASPES  OH holy Daniel prophet father friend  I come the wretched messenger of ill  Thy foes complot thy death For what can mean  This newmade law extorted from the king  Almost by force What can it mean O Daniel  But to involve thee in the toils they spread  To snare thy precious life  DANIEL  How was the king  Consenting to this edict  ARASPES  They surpris'd  His easy nature took him when his heart  Was soften'd by their blandishments They wore  The mask of public virtue to deceive him  Beneath the specious name of gen'ral good  They wrought him to their purposes no time  Allow'd him to delib'rate One short hour  Another moment and his soul had gain'd  Her natural tone of virtue  DANIEL  That great Pow'r  Who suffers evil only to produce  Some unseen good permits that this shou'd be  And HE permitting I well pleas'd resign  Retire my friend This is my second hour  Of daily pray'r Anon we'll meet again  Here in the open face of that bright sun  Thy fathers worshipp'd will I offer up  As is my rule petition to our GOD  For thee for me for Solyma for all  ARASPES  Oh stay what mean'st thou sure thou hasy not heard  The edict of the king I thought but now  Thou knew'st its purport It expressly says  That no petition henceforth shall be made  For thirty days save only to the king  Nor pray'r nor intercession shall be heard  Of any God or man but of Darius  DANIEL  And think'st thou then my rev'rence for the king  Good as he is shall tempt ne to renounce  My sworn allegiance to the King of kings  Hast thou commanded legions tempted death  In various shapes and shrink'st at danger now  Come learn of me I'll teach thee to be bold  Tho' sword I never drew Fear not Araspes  The feeble vengeance of a mortal man  Whose breath is in his nostrils for wherein  Is he to be accounted of but fear  The awaken'd vengeance of the living Lord  He who can plunge the everlasting soul  In infinite perdition  ARASPES  Then O Daniel  If thou persist to disobey the edict  Retire and hide thee from the prying eyes  Of busy malice  DANIEL  He who is asham'd  To vindicate the honour of his GOD  Of him the living LORD shall be asham'd  When he shall judge the tribes  ARASPES  Yet O remember  Oft have I heard thee say the secret heart  Is fair Devotion's Temple there the saint  Ev'n on that living altar lights the flame  Of purest sacrifice which burns unseen  Not unacceptedI remember too  When Syrian Naaman  Kings chap v  by Elisha's hand  Was cleans'd from foul pollution and his mind  Enlighten'd by the miracle confess'd  The Almighty GOD of Jacob that he deem'd it  No flagrant violation of his faith  To bend at Rimmon's shrine nor did the Seer  Forbid the rite external  DANIEL  Know Araspes  Heav'n deigns to suit our trials to our strength  A recent convert feeble in his faith  Naaman perhaps had sunk beneath the weight  Of so severe a duty But shall I  Shall Daniel shall the servant of the Lord  A vet'ran in his cause one train'd to know  And do his will one exercis'd in woe  Bred in captivity and born to suffer  Shall I from known from certain duty shrink  To shun a threaten'd danger O Araspes  Shall I advanc'd in age in zeal decline  Grow careless as I reach my journey's end  And slacken in my pace the goal in view  Perish discretion when it interferes  With duty Perish the safe policy  Of human wit where GOD's eternal name  Is put in competition Shall his law  Be set at nought that I may live at ease  How wou'd the heathen triumph shou'd I fall  Thro' coward fear How wou'd God's enemies  Insultingly blaspheme  ARASPES  Yet think a moment  DANIEL  No  Where evil may be  done  'tis right to ponder  Where only  suffer'd  know the shortest pause  Is much too long Had great Darius paus'd  This ill had been prevented But for me  Araspes to deliberate is to sin  ARASPES  Think of thy pow'r thy favour with Darius  Think of thy life's importance to the tribes  Scarce yet return'd in safety Live O live  To serve the cause of GOD  DANIEL  GOD will sustain  Himself his righteous cause He knows to raise  Fit instruments to serve him As for me  The spacious earth holds not a bait to tempt me  What wou'd it profit me if I shou'd gain  Imperial Ecbatan th' extended land  Of fruitful Media nay the world's wide round  If my eternal soul must be the price  Farewell my friend time presses I have stol'n  Some moments from my duty to confirm  And strengthen thy young faith Let us fulfil

the princely ensigns where  Which is the slave and which great David's heir  Alas the beggar's ashes are not known  From his who lately sat on Israel's throne  How stands my great account My soul survey  The debt ETERNAL JUSTICE bids thee pay  Shou'd I frail Memory's records strive to blot  Will Heav'n's tremendous reck'ning be forgot  Can I alas the awful volume tear  Or raze one page of the dread register  "Prepare thy house thy heart in order set  "Prepare the Judge of Heaven and Earth to meet"  So spake the warning ProphetAwful words  Which fearfully my troubled soul records  Am  I prepar'd and  can  I meet my doom  Nor shudder at the dreaded wrath to come  Is  all in order set my house my heart  Does no besetting sin still claim a part  Does no one cherish'd vice with ling'ring pace  Reluctant leave me to the work of grace  Did I each day for this great day prepare  By righteous deeds by sinsubduing pray'r  Did I each night each day's offence repent  And each unholy thought and word lament  Still have these ready hands th' afflicted fed  And ministred to Want her daily bread  The cause I knew not did I well explore  Friend advocate and parent of the poor  Did I to gratify some sudden gust  Of thoughtless appetite some impious lust  Of pleasure or of power such sums employ  As wou'd have crown'd pale penury with joy  Did I in groves forbidden altars raise  Or molten Gods adore or idols praise  Did my firm faith to Heav'n still point the way  Did charity to man my actions sway  Did meekey'd Patience all my steps attend  Did gen'rous Candour mark me for her friend  Did I unjustly seek to build my name  On the pil'd ruins of another's fame  Did I like hell abhor th' insidious lie  The low deceit th' unmanly calumny  Did my fix'd soul the impious wit detest  Did my firm virtue scorn th' unhallow'd jest  The sneer profane and the poor ridicule  Of shallow Infidelity's dull school  Did I still live as born one day to die  And view th' eternal world with constant eye  If so I liv'd if so I kept thy word  In mercy view in mercy hear me LORD  My holiest deeds  indulgence  will require  The best but to  forgiveness  will aspire  If Thou my purest services regard  'Twill be with pardon only not reward  How imperfection's stamp'd on all below  How sin intrudes in all we say or do  How late in all the insolence of health  I charm'd th' Assyrian  This is an anachronism Hezekiah did not shew his treasures to the Assyrian till after his recovery from his sickness  by my boast of wealth  How fondly with elab'rate pomp display'd  My glitt'ring treasures with what triumph laid  My gold and gems before his dazzled eyes  And found a rich reward in his surprise  O mean of soul can wealth elate the heart  Which of the man himself is not a part  O poverty of pride O foul disgrace  Disgusted Reason blushing hides her face  Mortal and proud strange contradicting terms  Pride for Death's victim for the prey of worms  Of all the wonders which th' eventful life  Of man presents of all the mental strife  Of warring passions all the raging fires  Of furious appetites and mad desires  Not one so strange appears as this alone  That man is proud of what is not his own  How short is human life the very breath  Which frames my words accelerates my death  Of this short life how large a portion's fled  To what is gone I am already dead  As dead to all my years and minutes past  As I to what remains shall be at last  Can I my cares and pains so far forget  To view my vanish'd years with fond regret  Can I again my wornout fancy cheat  Indulge fresh hope solicit new deceit  Of all the vanities weak man admires  Which greatness gives or sanguine youth desires  Of these my soul which hast thou not enjoy'd  With each with all thy sated pow'rs are cloy'd  What can I then expect from length of days  More wealth more wisdom pleasure health or praise  More pleasure hope not that deluded king  For when did age increase of pleasure bring  Is health of years prolong'd the common boast  And dearearn'd praise is it not cheaply lost  More wisdom that indeed were happiness  That were a wish a king might well confess  But when did Wisdom covet length of days  Or seek its bliss in pleasure wealth or praise  NoWisdom views with an indifferent eye  All finite joys all blessings born to die  Wisdom on earth is an immortal guest  Compell'd to starve at an unreal feast  A spark which upward tends by nature's force  A stream diverted from its parent source  A drop dissever'd from the boundless sea  A moment parted from eternity  A broken ray which seeks its central soul  A part which longs to mingle with its whole  A pilgrim panting for the rest to come  An exile anxious for his native home  Why shou'd I ask my forfeit life to save  Is Heav'n unjust which dooms me to the grave  Was I with hope of endless days deceiv'd  Or of lov'd life am I alone bereav'd  Let all the great the rich the learn'd the wise  Let all the shades of Judah's monarchs rise  And say if genius learning empire wealth  Youth beauty virtue strength renown or health  Has once revers'd th' immutable decree  On Adam pass'd of man's mortality  Whathave these eyes ne'er seen the felon worm  The damask cheek devour the finish'd form  On the pale rose of blasted beauty feed  Or riot on the lip so lately red  Where are our fathers Where th' illustrious line  Of holy prophets and of men divine  Live they for ever Do they shun the grave  Or when did Wisdom its professor save  When did the brave escape When did the breath  Of Eloquence charm the dull ear of Death  When did the cunning argument avail  The polish'd period or the varnish'd tale  The eye of lightning or the soul of fire  Which througing thousands crowded to admire  Ev'n while we praise the verse the poet dies  And silent as his lyre great David lies  Thou blest Isaiah who at God's command  Now speak'st repentance to a guilty land  Must die as wise and good thou hadst not been  As Nebat's son who taught the land to sin  And shall  I  then be spar'd O monstrous pride  Shall I escape when Solomon has died  If all the worth of all the saints was vain  Peace peace my troubled soul nor dare complain  Lord I submit Complete thy gracious will  For if Thou slay me  Job  I will trust Thee still  O be my will so swallow'd up in thine  That I may do  thy  will in doing  mine  SENSIBILITY A POETICAL EPISTLE TO THE HON MRS BOSCAWEN  Spirits are not finely touch'd but to fine issues  SHAKESPEARE  The following little Poem was sent several years ago as an Epistle to the honoured Friend to whom it is inscribed It has since been enlarged and several passages have been added or altered as circumstances required  SENSIBILITY A POETICAL EPISTLE TO THE HON MRS BOSCAWEN  ACCEPT BOSCAWEN these unpolish'd lays  Nor blame too much the verse you cannot praise  For you far other bards have wak'd the string  Far other bards for you were wont to sing  Yet on the gale their parting music steals  Yet your charm'd ear the lov'd impression feels  You heard the lyres of LYTTELTON and YOUNG  And this a Grace and that a Seraph strung  These are no moreBut not with these decline  The Attic chasteness and the flame divine  Stil  sad  Milton calls Euripides  Sad Electra's Poet  Elfrida's Poet  shall complain  And either WARTON breathe his classic strain  Nor fear lest genuine poesy expire  While tuneful BEATTIE wakes old Spenser's lyre  His sympathetic lay his soul reveals  And paints the perfect  Bard  from what he feels  Illustrious LOWTH for him the muses wove  The fairest garland from their greenest grove  Tho' Latian bards had gloried in his name  When in full brightness burnt the Latian flame  Yet fir'd with nobler hopes than transient Bays  He scorn'd the meed of perishable praise  Spurn'd the cheap wreath by human science won  Borne on the wing sublime of Amos' son  He seiz'd his mantle as the Prophet flew  And caught some portion of his spirit too  To snatch bright beauty from devouring fate  And bid it boast with him a deathless date  To shew how Genius  See his Discourses to the Academy  fires how Taste restrains  While what both are his pencil best explains  Have we not REYNOLDS Lives not JENYNS yet  To prove his lowest title was a Wit  Tho' purer flames thy hallow'd zeal inspire  Than e'er were kindled at the Muse's fire  Thee mitred  See the Bishop's admirable Poem on Death  CHESTER all the Nine shall boast  And is not JOHNSON theirs himself an host  Yesstill for you your gentle stars dispense  The charm of friendship and the feast of sense  Yours is the bliss and Heav'n no dearer sends  To call the wisest brightest bestyour friends  With CARTER trace the wit to Athens known  Or find in MONTAGU that wit our own  Or pleas'd attend CHAPONE's instructive page  Which charms her own and forms the rising age  Or boast in WALSINGHAM the various pow'r  To soothe the lonely grace the letter'd hour  To polisn'd life its highest charm she gives  Whose song is music and whose canvass lives  DELANY shines in worth serenely bright  Wisdom's strong ray and Virtue's milder light  And she who bless'd the friend and grac'd the page  Of Swift still lends her lustre to our age  Long long protract thy light O star benign  Whose setting beams with added brightness shine  O muchlov'd BARBAULD shall my heart refuse  Its tribute to thy Virtues and thy Muse  While round thy brow the Poet's wreathe I twine  This humble merit shall at least be mine  In all thy praise to take a gen'rous part  Thy laurels bind thee closer to my heart  My verse thy merits to the world shall teach  And love the genius it despairs to reach  Yet what is wit and what the Poet's art  Can Genius shield the vulnerable heart  Ah no where bright imagination reigns  The finewrought spirit feels acuter pains  Where glow exalted sense and taste refin'd  There keener anguish rankles in the mind  There feeling is diffus'd thro' ev'ry part  Thrills in each nerve and lives in all the heart  And those whose gen'rous souls each tear wou'd keep  From others' eyes are born themselves to weep  Say can the boasted pow'rs of wit and song  Of life one pang remove one hour prolong  Presumptuous hope which daily truths deride  For you alas have weptand GARRICK dy'd  Ne'er shall my heart his lov'd remembrance lose  Guide critic guardian glory of my muse  Oh shades of Hampton witness as I mourn  Cou'd wit or song clude  his  destin'd urn  Tho' living virtue still your haunts endears  Yet bury'd worth shall justify my tears  GARRICK those pow'rs which form a friend were thine  And let me add with pride that friend was mine  With pride at once the vain emotion's fled  Far other thoughts are sacred to the dead  Who now with spirit keen yet judgment cool  Th' unequal wand'rings of my muse shall rule  Whose partial praise my worthless verse ensure  For Candor smil'd when GARRICK wou'd endure  If harsher critics were compell'd to blame  I gain'd in friendship what I lost in fame  And friendship's fost'ring smiles can well repay  What critic rigour justly takes away  With keen acumen how his piercing eye  The fault conceal'd from vulgar view wou'd spy  While with a gen'rous warmth he strove to hide  Nay vindicate the fault his judgment spied  So pleas'd cou'd he detect a happy line  That he wou'd fancy merit ev'n in mine  Oh gen'rous error when by friendship bred  His praises flatter'd me but not misled  No narrow views cou'd bound his lib'ral mind  His friend was man his party human kind  Agreed in this opposing statesmen strove  Who most shou'd gain his praise or court his love  His worth all hearts as to one centre drew  Thus Tully's Atticus was Caesar's too  His wit so keen it never miss'd its end  So blameless too it never lost a friend  So chaste that modesty ne'er learn'd to fear  So pure religion might unwounded hear  How his quick mind strong pow'rs and ardent heart  Impoverish'd nature and exhausted art  A brighter bard records  Mr Sheridan's Monody  a deathless muse  But I his talents in his virtues lose  Great parts are Nature's gift but that he shone  Wise moral good and virtuouswas his own  Tho' Time his silent hand across has stole  Soft'ning the tints of sorrow on the soul  The deep impression long my heart shall fill  And every mellow'd trace be perfect still  Forgive BOSCAWEN if my sorrowing heart  Intent on grief forget the rules of art  Forgive if wounded recollection melt  You best can pardon who have oft'nest felt  You who for many a friend and hero mourn  Who bend in anguish o'er the frequent urn  You who have found how much the feeling heart  Shapes its own wound and points itself the dart  You who from tender sad experience feel  The wounds such minds receive can never heal  That grief a thousand entrances can find  Where parts superior dignify the mind  Wou'd you renounce the pangs those feelings give  Secure in joyless apathy to live  For tho' in souls where taste and sense abound  Pain thro' a thousand avenues can wound  Yet the same avenues are open still  To casual blessings as to casual ill  Nor is the trembling temper more awake  To every wound which misery can make  Than is the finelyfashion'd nerve alive  To every transport pleasure has to give  For if when homefelt joys the mind elate  It mourns in secret for another's fate  Yet when its own sad griefs invade the breast  Abroad in others blessings see it blest  Ev'n the soft forrow of remember'd woe  A not unpleasing sadness may bestow  Let not the vulgar read this pensive strain  Their jests the tender anguish wou'd profane  Yet these some deem the happiest of their kind  Whose low enjoyments never reach'd the mind  Who ne'er a pain but for themselves have known  Nor ever felt a sorrow but their own  Who call romantic every finer thought  Conceiv'd by pity or by friendship wrought  Ah wherefore happy where's the kindred mind  Where the large soul that takes in human kind  Where the best passions of the mortal breast  Where the warm blessing when another's blest  Where the soft lenitives of others pain  The social sympathy the sense humane  The sigh of rapture and the tear of joy  Anguish that charms and transports that destroy  For tender Sorrow has her pleasures too  Pleasures which prosp'rous Dulness never knew  She never knew in all her coarser bliss  The sacred rapture of a pain like this  Nor think the cautious only are the just  Who never was deceiv'd I wou'd not trust  Then take ye happy vulgar take your part  Of sordid joy which never touch'd the heart  Benevolence which seldom stays to chuse  Lest pausing Prudence teach her to refuse  Friendship which once determin'd never swerves  Weighs e'er it trusts but weighs not e'er it serves  And softey'd Pity and Forgiveness bland  And melting Charity with open hand  And artless Love believing and believ'd  And gen'rous Confidence which ne'er deceiv'd  And Mercy stretching out ere Want can speak  To wipe the tear from pale Affliction's cheek  These ye have never knownthen take your part  Of sordid joy which never touch'd the heart  Ye who have melted in bright Glory's flame  Or felt the spiritstirring breath of fame  Ye noble few in whom her promis'd meed  Wakes the great thought and makes the wish the deed  Ye who have tasted the delight to give  And God's own agents bid the wretched live  Who the chill haunts of Desolation seek  Raise the sunk heart and flush the fading cheek  Ye who with pensive Petrarch love to mourn  Or weave fresh chaplets for Tibullus' urn  Who cherish both in Hammond's plaintive lay  The Provence myrtle and the Roman bay  Ye who divide the joys and share the pains  Which merit feels or Heav'nborn Fancy feigns  Wou'd you renounce such joys such pains as these  For vulgar pleasures or for selfish ease  Wou'd you to 'scape the pain the joy forego  And miss the transport to avoid the woe  Wou'd you the sense of real sorrow lose  Or cease to wooe the melancholy Muse  No Greville  Beautiful Ode to Indifference  noThy song tho' steep'd in tears  Tho' all thy soul in all thy strain appears  Yet wou'dst thou all thy wellsung anguish chuse  And all th' inglorious peace thou begg'st refuse  Or you BOSCAWEN when you fondly melt  In raptures none but mothers ever felt  And view enamour'd in your beauteous race  All LEVESON's sweetness and all BEAUFORT's grace  Yet think what dangers each lov'd child may share  The youth if valiant and the maid if fair  That perils multiply as blessings flow  And constant sorrows on enjoyments grow  You who have felt how fugitive is joy  That while we clasp the phantom we destroy  That life's bright sun is dimm'd by clouded views  And who have most to love have most to lose  Yet from these fair possessions wou'd you part  To shield from future pain your guarded heart  Wou'd your sond mind renounce its tender boast  Or wish their op'ning bloom of promise lost  Yield the dear hopes which break upon your view  For all the quiet Dulness ever knew  Debase the objects of your tend'rest pray'r  To save the dangers of a distant care  Consent to shun the anxious fears you prove  They less shou'd merit or you less shou'd love  Yet while I hail the Sympathy Divine  Which makes O man the wants of others thine  I mourn heroic JUSTICE scarcely own'd  And PRINCIPLE for SENTIMENT dethron'd  While FEELING boasts her evertearful eye  Stern TRUTH firm FAITH and manly VIRTUE fly  Sweet SENSIBILITY thou soothing pow'r  Who shedd'st thy blessings on the natal hour  Like fairy favours Art can never seize  Nor affectation catch thy pow'r to please  Thy subtile essence still eludes the chains  Of Definition and defeats her pains  Sweet Sensibility thou keen delight  Thou hasty moral sudden sense of right  Thou untaught goodness Virtue's precious seed  Thou sweet precursor of the gen'rous deed  Beauty's quick relish Reason's radiant morn  Which dawns soft light before Reflexion's born  To those who know thee not no words can paint  And those who know thee know all words are faint  'Tis not to mourn because a sparrow dies  To rave in artificial extasies  'Tis not to melt in tender  Otway's  fires  'Tis not to faint when injur'd  Shore  expires  'Tis not because the ready eye o'erflows  At  Clementina's  or  Clarissa's  woes  Forgive O Richardson nor think I mean  With cold contempt to blast thy peerless scene  If some faint love of virtue glow in me  Pure spirit I first caught that flame from thee  While soft Compassion silently relieves  Loquacious  Feeling  hints how much she gives  Laments how oft her wounded heart has bled  And boasts of many a tear she never shed  As words are but th' external marks to tell  The fair ideas in the mind that dwell  And only are of things the outward sign  And not the things themselves they but define  So exclamations tender tones fond tears  And all the graceful drapery Pity wears  These are not Pity's self they but express  Her inward sufferings by their pictur'd dress  And these fair marks reluctant I relate  These lovely symbols may be counterfeit  Celestial Pity why must I deplore  Thy sacred image stamp'd on basest ore  There are who fill with brilliant plaints the page  If a poor linnet meet the gunner's rage  There are who for a dying sawn display  The tend'rest anguish in the sweetest lay  Who for a wounded animal deplore  As if friend parent country were no more  Who boast quick rapture trembling in their eye  If from the spider's snare they save a fly  Whose wellsung sorrows every breast inflame  And break all hearts but his from whom they came  Yet scorning life's  dull  duties to attend  Will persecute a wife or wrong a friend  Alive to every woe by  fiction  dress'd  The innocent he wrong'd the wretch distress'd  May plead in vain their suff'rings come not near  Or he relieves them cheaply with a tear  Not so the tender moralist of Tweed  His  Man of Feeling  is a man indeed  Oh bless'd Compassion Angel Charity  More dear one genuine deed perform'd for thee  Than all the periods Feeling e'er can turn  Than all thy soothing pages polish'd STERNE  Not that by deeds alone this love's exprest  If so the affluent only were the blest  One silent wish one pray'r one soothing word  The precious page of Mercy shall record  One soulfelt sigh by pow'rless Pity giv'n  Accepted incense shall ascend to Heav'n  Since trifles make the sum of human things  And half our mis'ry from our foibles springs  Since life's best joys consist in peace and ease  And few can save or serve but all may please  Oh let th' ungentle spirit learn from hence  A small unkindness is a great offence  Large bounties to bestow we wish in vain  But all may shun the guilt of giving pain  To bless mankind with tides of flowing wealth  With pow'r to grace them or to crown with health  Our little lot denies but Heav'n decrees  To all the gift of minist'ring to ease  The gentle offices of patient love  Beyond all flatt'ry and all price above  The mild forbearance at another's fault  The taunting word suppress'd as soon as thought  On these Heav'n bade the bliss of life depend  And crush'd illfortune when he made a FRIEND  A solitary blessing few can find  Our joys with those we love are interwin'd  And he whose helpful tenderness removes  Th' obstructing thorn which wounds the breast he loves  Smooths not another's rugged path alone  But scatters roses to adorn his own  The hint malevolent the look oblique  The obvious satire or implied dislike  The sneer equivocal the harsh reply  And all the cruel language of the eye  The artful injury whose venom'd dart  Scarce wounds the hearing while it stabs the heart  The guarded phrase whose meaning kills yet told  The list'ner wonders how you thought it cold  Small slights contempt neglect unmix'd with hate  Make up in number what they want in weight  These and a thousand griefs minute as these  Corrode our comfort and destroy our ease  As this strong feeling tends to good or ill  It gives fresh pow'r to vice or principle  'Tis not peculiar to the wife and good  'Tis passion's flame the virtue of the blood  But to divert it to its proper course  There Wisdom's pow'r appears there Reason's force  If illdirected it pursues the wrong  It adds new strength to what before was strong  Breaks out in wild irregular desires  Disorder'd passions and illicit fires  But if the virtuous bias rule the soul  This lovely feeling then adorns the whole  Sheds its sweet sunshine on the moral part  Nor wastes on fancy what shou'd warm the heart  Cold and inert the mental pow'rs wou'd lie  Without this quick'ning spark of Deity  To draw the rich materials from the mine  To bid the mass of intellect refine  To melt the sirm to animate the cold  And Heav'n's own impress stamp on nature's gold  To give immortal MIND its sinest tone  Oh SENSIBILITY is all thy own  THIS is th' etherial flame which lights and warms  In song transports us and in action charms  'Tis THIS that makes the pensive strains of GRAY  This is meant of the  Elegy in a Country Churchyard  of which exquisite Poem  Sensibility  is perhaps the characteristic beauty  Win to the open heart their easy way  Makes the touch'd spirit glow with kindred fire  When sweet SERENA's  Triumphs of Temper  poet wakes the lyre  'Tis THIS tho' Nature's hidden treasures lie  Bare to the keen inspection of her eye  Makes PORTLAND's face its brightest rapture wear  When her large bounty smooths the bed of care  'Tis THIS that breathes thro' SEVIGNÈ's sweet page  That nameless grace which soothes a second age  'Tis THIS whose charms the soul resistless seize  And gives BOSCAWEN half her pow'r to please  Yet why those terrors why that anxious care  Since your last  Admiral Boscawen's only remaining son was then in America and at the battle of Lexington  hope the deathful war will dare  Why dread that energy of soul which leads  To dang'rous glory by heroic deeds  Why tremble lest his ardent soul aspire  You fear the son because you knew the sire  Hereditary valour you deplore  And dread yet wish to find one hero more  THE END  Just Published  Written by the
