 Antinomian Heresy exploded  IN AN APPEAL TO THE CHRISTIAN WORLD Against the Unscriptural DOCTRINES and Licentious TENETS of Mr  JAMES RELLY  Advanced in His TREATISE of UNION  c  There must be Heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest  Cor xi  By  W MASON  LONDON  Printed and Sold by M LEWIS in  Paternosterrow  also Sold by G KEITH in  Gracechurchstreet  E DILLY in the  Poultry  and M WITHERS in  Fleetstreet  Price Sixpence  Antinomian Heresy exploded  IN AN APPEAL  c  _THE Doctrine of a Sinner's Justification in the Sight of God whether by Faith or good Works is a Point that has often exercised the Pen of Controversy but except at this present Time scarcely if ever was it known that any Author or Preacher departed so far from the Truth as to run into such loose unscriptural and licentious Principles as to maintain that  either  much less  both  Faith and good Works are excluded by the Christian Doctrine as unnecessary to eternal Life and Salvation Methinks one should be tender of entertaining so bad an Opinion of the Principles of any Professor of Christianity and exceedingly cautious of fixing such a gross and unchristian Charge upon any one who takes upon himself to be a Preacher of the Gospel of Holiness Yet such is the peculiar  Heresy  of this Day For that such Doctrine is openly in the Face of the Sun avowed preached and published we have too many unhappy Instances to prove both the Pulpit and Press send forth these wild extravagant and antichristian Notions than which nothing is more contrary to the Doctrines of the Gospel more subversive of the Truths of GOD and more naturally leads to Presumption vain Confidence and Delusion of Soul tends to harden Men i  a State of Sinfulness and to cherish and establish the Practice of Profaneness  n utter contempt of GOD's Word and Ordinances and a total neg  ect of the Means of Grace Therefore never was that Caution of  ur Saviour more needful to be observed by Professors than in this  ur Day  Take h  ed what you hear  Mark iv  To shew how far Mr  Relly  is concerned in and answerable for the Observations I have made is my present Design In his Treatise entitled UNION This Gentleman's erroneous Principles and the licentious Doctrines he maintains are very plain and evident In the Preface to this Tract the Author says he is  "Not afraid to tread the most unfrequented Path and walk therein  undisturbed  notwithstanding the clamorous Accusations of  Singularity Novelty  and  Heresy  "  I would by no Means attempt to disturb him in his  Reveries  But as I am inclined to animadvert upon to enter my Protest against and by Scripture to detect and confute some erroneous Positions delusive Assertions and unscriptural Doctrines he has been pleased to make and advance I would therefore rather choose to submit an Appeal to the Christian World than  disturb  the Author himself with an Address thereon For when Error and Falsehood is advanced to the World for the Truths of the Gospel and the Doctrines of Christianity I hope a Zeal for the Truth consistent with the Spirit of Meekness will justify my Attempt to point out such Principles try them by the Standard of GOD's Word shew their Inconsistency with the Oracles of Truth and the dangerous Effects and licentious Consequences they are pregnant with and which they must naturally bring forth Happy shall I think myself if hereby I may be the Means of deterring others from stepping aside into the same  unfrequented Path  of  Singularity Novelty  and  Heresy  which this Author has unhappily strayed into and is so far blinded as to mistake the  broad Road  of Error for the narrow Path of Truth though he is bold enough to declare he is  "not afraid to walk in it"  CHAPTER I  The glorious Oeconomy of Salvation displayed in the Grace of the Holy Trinity The Father's Love in the Gift of his Son for his People The Love of Jesus in their Redemption and Justification and the Spirit's Energy on their Hearts producing Repentance Faith and Holiness laid down as consistent with the Scripture illustrated from Nature and the Fruits and Effects demonstrable in Opposition to the present  Antinomian  unscriptural Tenets  THE only meritorious and procuring Cause of the Justification Pardon and Salvation of Sinners is the Life and Death atoning Blood and spotless Righteousness of the GODman Jesus Christâ–ª  This is the peculiar and distinguishing Doctrine of the Gospel of the Grace of GOD Therefore it has been received and gloried in as such by the People of GOD in every Age of the Christian Church But that it follows from hence that Sinners are made Partakers of Glory Happiness and eternal Life without  Repentance Faith  and  Holiness  is absolutely denied it being contrary to the Purpose and Will of GOD as it is clearly revealed and fully expressed in the sacred Pages For the very End and Design of our Lord's coming in the Flesh was to purchase and procure for his People the outpouring of the Holy Spirit under whose divine Energy and sovereign Influences upon their Hearts they are enabled to repent believe and become obedient to the Gospel of their Saviour Jesus Christ Repentance Faith and Holiness are the  Graces  and Blessings of the new Covenant Every Member of Jesus is made a Partaker of them His Blood and Righteousness entitles them to the Kingdom of Glory and by these Graces their Souls are qualified and prepared for the Enjoyment of it And it is exceeding plain and obvious from the Tenor of Scripture that the Love and Grace of GOD the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ is magnified manifested and displayed by and thro' the Holy Spirit's Agency in quickning regenerating and sanctifying the Souls of the Elect as fully and as truly as the Love of the Father is displayed by the Gift of his Son or the Grace of our blessed Saviour in giving himself a Sacrifice for their Sins and redeeming them to GOD by his precious Blood  Indeed the Gift of Jesus Christ for lost Sinners is the Result of that Love which dwelt in the Breast of GOD the Father from all Eternity to his People And the Gift of the Holy Spirit to enlighten their Minds and sanctify their Souls is in Consequence of Christ having undertook and finished the Work of their Redemption Jesus being now gone to the Father according to his most true Promise sends the Comforter Jesus being glorified as the Head the Spirit descends on his Members to accomplish and produce such spiritual Blessings upon the Heart and in the Life of the Heirs of Promise which Mr  Relly  is pleased entirely to explode and deny to treat with the utmost contempt and to stigmatize as the Marks of the  false Christ  and the Workings of the  Spirit of Antichrist  Without this inward Work upon the Heart under the sovereign and vital Operations of the Holy Spirit it is plain from GOD's Word and the Condition of Mankind in its Fallen State as also from the Experience and Testimony of the People of GOD in every Age of the Church from  Adam  to  Meses  from  Moses  to Christ and from Christ to this Day that no Man is able of himself to turn to GOD  by true Repentance to  believe with his Heart unto Righteousness  or to bring forth  Fruit unto Holiness  unto eternal Life And if the Soul is destitute of these Graces Profession is vain and insignificant Notions and Opinions are lighter than Vanity Knowledge is but pompous Ignorance and as yet the Gospel preached has affected such a Professor no more than outward Sound For  except ye repent ye shall perish  Luke xiii  He that believeth not shall be damned  Mark xvi  And without Holiness no Man shall see the Lord  Heb xii These Declarations from our Saviour himself and from the Spirit of Truth will be an eternal Bar to the Salvation and Glory of every Soul that dies in an impenitent unbelieving unholy State notwithstanding all the soft Casuistry and artful Sophistry of libertine Deceivers  From GOD's first creating that great Luminary the Sun its powerful Shining invigorating Rays enlightening and enlivening Influences have shed a genial Warmth and prolific Energy upon the whole Creation whereby all Nature appears with Chearfulness and is enriched with Fruitfulness And no sooner did the Glory of the  Sun of Righteousness  begin to dawn after the Darkness and Misery of the Fall of Man but with spiritual and heavenly Rays Jesus enlightened quickened animated and refreshed the Hearts of his People producing Chearfulness and Joy in their Soul and Fruitfulness of the heavenly Graces in their Life and Practice By Virtue of their Union with Christ as the Source of Life and Fountain of Influence Believers  receive out of his Fulness Grace for Grace  But more especially under the Gospel Dispensation the Power and Influence of the Holy Spirit is manifested with superior Energy and meridian Brightness hence is the Gospel emphatically stiled  the Ministration of the Spirit  Cor iii  Now to allow of the Power and Influence which the Sun hath upon the Earth and yet to deny that Life and Fruitfulness are communicated to the natural World by his impregnating Rays is contrary both to Reason and Observation in natural Things So in spiritual Matters to contend for the Union of the Soul with Jesus the Sun of Righteousness and yet deny that spiritual Life and Fruitfulness is thereby communicated to his Members is repugnant both to Scripture and Experience And yet however absurd and irrational this Notion is such is Mr  Relly  's avowed Tenet Yea it is plain and obvious from the whole Drift of this Author's Treatise that he denies and explodes what the Scripture maintains namely that the Members of Jesus are influenced to personal Holiness or to use Scripture  Language that they ever do or can bring forth  the Fruits of Righteousness  Phil i  Fruit unto Holiness  Rom vi  Fruit unto GOD  chap vii in themselves  But well would it be for this Author and for all those who oppose the plain Truths of GOD in this Point did they but consider this scriptural Distinction though Believers bring forth Fruit unto GOD  in  themselves yet not  of  and  from  themselves Their  Sufficiency to every good Word and Work is of GOD  Being united to the Lord Jesus they receive Life Strength and Power out of his Fulness They are taught by his Word influenced by his Spirit to live to the Glory of GOD They partake of Holiness in and from the Lord Jesus whereby they are enabled to produce the Fruits of Holiness and good Works in their Lives and Conversations Though the Fruits which they bear and bring forth do not make them holy or are the Cause of their Holiness any more than the Grapes which grow on the Vine make or constitute it a Vine or are the Source and Cause of its Fruitfulness yet such Fruits which are agreeable to the Word of GOD and produced  in and by them  thro' the Grace and Assistance of the Spirit of GOD prove and evidence that they are new Creatures in Christ Jesus That their Souls are born again of the Spirit of GOD That they  live in the Spirit  are  led by the Spirit and bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit  Yea being made good Trees they bring forth good Fruit and so answer our Lord's Description  By their Fruits ye  all know them  Matt viii But I shall have Occasion to speak more fully to this Point as I proceed  CHAP II  Mr  Relly  's absurd Notion of Universal Salvation exploded as unscriptural false Quotation and corrupt Gloss put upon Scripture to maintain it detected  I Shall here present my Reader with a Quotation from Mr  Relly's Treatise of Union  c  page  and a very striking one indeed It contains I think the most unparallelled Absurdity shocking Perversion of the Meaning and the most licentious Comment that ever was put upon the Words of Scripture  "The Apostle saith according to Mr  Relly  's Quotation  that GOD hath given to us eternal Life and that this Life is in his Son and that he who believeth not  is Record hath made GOD a Liar  "  From whence saith Mr  Relly  "it is plain that he who believeth not hath eternal Life given him in the Son of GOD as fully as him who believeth"  It is plain Just as plain as that these Words inform us Mr  Relly  is an  Irish Bishop  Reader I appeal to your Judgment Does any Thing like it appear from the Words of the Apostle Is not this Conclusion the most forced and unnatural an Inference or Deduction quite Foreign to the Sense of the Apostle For the beloved Disciple in the very next Verse asserts  he that hath not the Son hath not Life  Therefore so far from its being plain that there is not the least Shadow of common Sense or Reason to support this Gloss but it is as contrary to the Apostle's Meaning as Light is to Darkness and Error to Truth Amazing that any Author should attempt to palm such glaring Absurdity such palpable Falshood upon Mankind for the Truths of Christianity  But to what End or Purpose is this false Gloss put upon these Words It is to propagate a Notion which has no Foundation in the Word of GOD but is utterly repugnant to it  viz  A Union of Sentiment with the Author of a sophistical unscriptural Tract entitled  Heaven open to all Men or a Theological Treatise proving that  all Men  shall be saved and made finally happy  This Author's Theology and Mr  Relly  's Notion in his  Treatise of Union  c are quite similar For the whole World consists but of two Sorts of Persons Believers and Unbelievers Now that Believers in Christ have eternal Life is clear from the Word of GOD And Mr  Relly  asserts he that believeth not hath eternal Life as fully as him who believeth therefore according to Mr  Relly all Mankind  Believers and Unbelievers shall be saved and made finally happy Here lies the very Sinew of this Person's Delusion Universal Salvation is the grand Basis upon which his Figment of UNION is founded But this Path of Doctrine is unfrequented by any of the Saints of GOD Never described in the Word of GOD therefore is truly the Path of  Singularity Novelty  and  Heresy  In the Sincerity of my Heart I pray this Author may want Company and enjoy Solitude and Retirement  Let us have Recourse to the sacred Oracles of Truth and shew the Inconsistency of this Notion with GOD's revealed Will and then we will rescue this Text from the false and corrupt Opinion which it is brought to establish When our blessed Lord gave that extensive Commission to his Apostles to  preach the Gospel to every Creature  he passes this Declaration as the certain Effect and Consequence  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned  Mark xvi Now will not Mr  Relly  upon his  Hypothesis tell us he that is damned hath nevertheless everlasting Life in Christ as fully as he that is saved Again our Saviour told the  Jews If ye believe not that I am he ye shall die in your Sins  John viii Which Sentence stands forth against Unbelievers having eternal Life to this Day But will Mr  Relly  explain away our Lord's Meaning and inform us that those who die in their Sins yet have eternal Life in Christ But our Lord in the same Chapter plainly asserts the contrary of such Persons  whither I go ye cannot come  And the same Spirit who spake by Jesus hath by St  Paul  described the awful State of some to whom the Gospel is  a Savour of Death unto Death  and of others who are  lost to whom the Gospel is hid  and assigns this Reason for it that  the God of this World blinds the Minds of those who believe not  And again he declares that  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming Fire taking Vengeance on them that know not GOD and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall be punished with everlasting Destruction from the Presence of the Lord and from the Glory of his Power  Thes i And once for all for there is no End of quoting Passages of Scripture to consute this impious and heretical Position Christ himself declares  he that believeth not is condemned alreadyHe that believeth not the Son shall not see Life but the Wrath of GOD abideth on him  John iii  How can we reconcile a State of Wrath and Condemnation with Possessing GOD's Love and Favour a lost State and not seeing Life with having eternal Life being punished with everlasting Destruction from GOD and yet enjoying Salvation as his Gift fully given The Bible hath no such Inconsistency Nor in any Part of it doth it declare that Unbelievers have eternal Life but quite the reverse nor doth it teach us to suppose with the Author of  Union  that all those who shall have their Portion with Unbelievers to whom the Lord will denounce the awful Doom  depart ye Cursed  c yet have eternal Life as fully given them in Christ as those  who believe to the saving their Souls  and on whom our Saviour will pronounce the joyful Sentence  come ye Blessed of my Father  c Surely before a Person can advance such Absurdity he must be  given up to a strong Delusion to believe a Lie  c  and to wrest the Scriptures to his own Destruction  It is no small Degree of Art and Sophistry which this Author affects so as to explain away the true Sense and Meaning of the Scripture Language and to dress it up in a false Garb and to give such a Turn to Scripture Phrases as best suits a vitiated  Mind and corrupt Principles And it is readily owned his Pupils and Admirers  oon attain the same Skill  I here give the World a Specimen of their expert Knack of explaining Scripture Upon this Assertion of our Saviour's  except a Man be born ag in he cannot see the Kingdom of GOD  Hear and Wonder They tell us the Text mentions  a Man  therefore Christ is  the  Man he was born again the Necessity of which he is here urging Again  strait is the Gate and narrow is the Way which leadeth unto Life and  few  there be that find it  Surprizing Comment  "There never was but one say they who sound the Way that is Christ"  So Christ is the  few  here mentioned Did Grammar and Sense ever meet with such a  owed Enemies before Again to St  James  's Assertion  I will shew thee my Faith by my Works  The  Antinomian  Answer is  "I shew you Christ's Works that is the Apostle's Meaning"  And when our Lord exhorts his Disciples to let their  Light shine before Men that they may see your good Works  c  "We are to let Christ shine and shew Men his good Works"  Once more to support the  Antinomian  Enmi  y against the Scripture Doctrine of  growing in Grace  this Text has been urged  divers Weights and Measures are an Abomination to the Lord  And lastly The Prophet's Interrogation  Isa  xxxiii  Who among us shall dwell with devouring Fire Who amongst us shall dwell with  verlasting Burnings  This is spoken of Christ say they Now this Method of explaining the Word is I suppose what this Author calls  "  reading the S  riptures in Christ  Nor have says he all the Masters in  Israel  for these Years though there have been always those who have attempted it been able to point out a Reconciliation and Harmony out of him"  page  But what hath not  Master R  ly  done Inimitable wonderful Man Sure he is  the  Man and Wisdom will die with him Take him for all in all we ne'er shall see his like again  Let us now consider the plain Sense and full Import of the Apostles Meaning in that Passage which has been so grossly perverted and shockingly corrupted to support Falshood and Heresy Far very far from a fair and honest Quotation hath this Author given He has transposed the Words o  the Apostle I suspect his Design hereby It is the better to accommodate the Words to support his Tenets Else why should he not give his Readers the Words in the Order they are placed Why has he exhibited them in a mangled disjointed Form My Reasons for Suspicion of Mr  Relly  's Method of quoting S  ripture will I think be fully justified presently  The Apostles Words  John  v  He that believeth on the Son of GOD hath the Witness in himself  are plain even the Witness of eternal  Life in and through the Lord Jesus Christ And again  He that believeth not GOD hath made him a Liar because he believeth not the Record which GOD hath given of his Son i e  that Sinners are saved through Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ only It is good to compare Scripture with Scripture And we have a Declaration from our Lord's own Mouth which runs parallel with this  GOD so loved the World as to give his only begotten Son that whosoever  believeth  on him should not perish but have everlasting Life  John iii Now on the contrary he that  believeth not  he denieth opposeth and rejecteth the Way of eternal Life and Salvation through Jesus Christ and seeks for and expects to find Righteousness in some other Way and Method contrary to the Gospel of the Grace of GOD and thus he gives the Lie to the Record of Truth the Report of the everlasting Gospel yea to the GOD of Truth himself than which nothing doth more enhance and aggravate the Sin of Unbelief And therefore so far from Unbelievers having eternal Life they can in no Scripture Sense be said to have Part or Lot in the Matter perhaps never may nay we are assured never will if they die in Unbelief For as many as are Ordained to eternal Life BELIEVE In Verse the Apostle goes on  this is the Record that GOD hath given to US eternal Life  To us To whom to all Mankind No such thing as appears very clear if we consider to whom the Apostle is addressing himself  These Things write I unto you  that believe  on the Name of the Son of GOD that ye may know that ye have eternal Life  Hence it is very plain and obvious the Apostle was not writing to nor speaking of Unbelievers at all nor of all Mankind in General for he afterwards fully declares the contrary Verse  we know  we who believe  that we are of GOD and that the whole World lieth in Wickedness  Agreeable hereto he says  he that hath the Son hath Life  spiritual Life He is quickened by Jesus Hath an experimental Knowledge of Christ by Faith He hath the Earnest of eternal Life He dwells in Christ and Christ in him He is one with Christ and Christ with him blessed Union not notional but scriptural He shall enjoy the Life of eternal GloryBut  he that hath not the Son of GOD hath not Life  he is dead dead in Trespasses and Sins destitute of the Life of GOD in his Soul He is ignorant of the Love of the Father Hath no Knowledge of Christ's Love and being destitute of Faith in his Blood and Righteousness has no right to eternal Life nor any Mectness for it but is under the second Death if he abide in Unbelief  he shall not see Life  So that nothing is more plain than that without Faith in Jesus no Sinner can be saved and that eternal Salvation is connected with Faith  Such is the full Import such the obvious Sense of the Apostle in this Passage How unjustly it is brought to support the present  Antinomian  Dream and Antichristian Delusion that  all Mankind  shall be saved or that any Sinner hath eternal Life without Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ let the Christian World judge To them I appeal and submit the following Consideration  When the Children of  Israel  had been bitten by Serpents  the Lord said to  Moses  make a fiery Serpent and set it upon a Pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he  looketh  upon it shall live  Numb xxi Now if after  Moses  had done this he had told  all the People  "GOD hath provided an Antidote therefore your Cure is effected without looking to the Remedy"  Would not such a Procedure as much as in him lay counteract the Design of GOD prevent the Cure and cause the Death and Destruction of the People This Type our Lord refers to himself  John  iii  As  Moses  lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting Life  But if Preachers instead of shewing the Necessity of Sinners  looking to Christ  and  believing  on Him that they might not perish but have everlasting Life should tell Mankind that they are  all  saved by Christ and though they do not believe have nevertheless eternal Life given them in Christ do they not hereby oppose GOD's Method of Salvation and act contrary to the Apostle's Practice whose Advice to a sensible convicted Sinner was  Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved  Acts xvi and thus as much as in them lies do they cause the People to err to deceive their own Souls so as to fancy themselves to be in a State of Salvation when they are in a State of Wrath and under Condemnation  CHAP III  The Antinomian Heresy of Christ's Faith being counted for Righteousness refuted The Scripture Doctrine of Justification by Faith explained and desended The Nature and Effects of a true Gosp  Faith in the Heart and Life of Christ's Members proved from Scripture in Opposition to loose and licentious Principles and Pro  tices  HAving in the last Chapter considered and I hope refuted th  unscriptural Position that Unbelievers have eternal Life give  them in Christ as fully as those who believe I would lay before m  Reader another of this Author's Tenets equally as absurd ridiculous  d unscriptural  Page  he asserts that Believers are not ju  ified by Faith wrought  in  them but by Christ's believing for them Thus he says  "this Text  Rom  iv  to him who worketh not but be  veth on him that justifieth the Ungodly his Faith is counted for Righ  usness  "shews us that Christ's Faith is counted for Righteousness to all such who working not  believeth on him as  justifying the Ungodly"  Amazing Discovery indeed Singular and unparallelled this Observation According to this Gloss here are two Believers intended by the Apostle Christ and the Sinner and Christ's Faith instead of Christ's Righteousness counted for Justification But can any Man of common Sense and Understanding rather can any Christian who has been taught  the Truth as it is in Jesus  receive and admit such strange and extravagant Flights of Fancy for solid Scripture Truths Surely not  Christ's Faith counted for Righteousness no more than the Crown of Thorns or purple Robe which was put on Jesus in the Day of his Humiliation and Suffering is counted for Righteousness Who is it that justifieth the Ungodly  it is GOD  saith St  Paul  What is the procuring Cause of Justification the perfect Righteousness and spotless Obedience of Jesus who is the Surety for Sinners and in their Nature and on their Account hath fulfilled all Righteousness and yielded full Satisfaction to divine Justice and this is reckoned counted and imputed to every convinced Sinner  who believeth on Jesus with his Heart unto Righteousness  as the Scriptures testify  Rom  x Hence  GOD is  said to be  just  and  the Justifier  of whom  of him who believes in Jesus  Rom iii This is the plain Sense and Meaning of this Text That the Phrase  his Faith  hath no other Antecedent but  him  of whom the Apostle saith  He worketh not but believeth  is clear And therefore this can have no Relation to Christ but to him who believes and works not to obtain Life For this I appeal to every one who hath common Understanding to read  This Author is pleased to tell us next  "that  Antichrist  says you are justified by your own Faith which will produce Righteousness in you to evidence it"  This is a bold Assertion indeed A severe if not a blasphemous Censure not only levelled against the Writings of the inspired Penmen but also falls upon the Person and Doctrine of the Lamb of GOD himself who spake as never Man spake who taught the Doctrines of Repentance Faith and Holiness as absolutely necessary to eternal Glory Now Faith is spoken of and described in Scripture not as any Work of Man but as  the Gift of GOD  wrought in the Heart of a Sinner by the Grace and Power of his Spirit And therefore as the Sinner is the Subject who possesses it and as the Heart is the Seat of it so in this Sense it may be called our  own Faith  As any Gift which is freely bestowed may properly be called the  ceiver's  own  both as to Propriety of Possession as well as in the Use Comfort and Advantage which arises from it  Thus in Scripture this Phrase  justified by Faith  frequently occurs  Rom  v  Being justified by Faith  c chap iii  we conclude a Man is justified by Faith  c Now I can't suppose my Reader to be so void of common Understanding as to imagine that in these or Scrip  ures of like Import the Writers ever meant any Faith but what the Sinner partakes of and possesses in his own Heart O  when we are said to be justified  by  Faith it is meant that we are justified  for  Faith as though it was the meritorious or procuring Cause of Justification in the Sight of GOD No that is effected by the perfect Righteousness Sacrifice and Bloodshedding of the Lord Jesus  only  And this being revealed published and declared by the Gospel as the only Refuge for lost and perishing Sinners to fly to  That  ungodly Sinner who is convinced of Sin and is enabled to have Recourse to this Method who trusts in relies upon and by Faith receives applies and appropriates Jesus Christ to his Soul is thereby enriched with all the Privileges of the Gospel  viz  Justification Pardon Peace Holiness and Salvation just as a Person is enriched by receiving any valuable Gift So this Gift of Righteousness which is by Jesus Christ is apprehended and received by Faith and is  unto all and upon all them who believe  They are delivered from the Guilt of Sin freed from the Condemnation of the Law and Righteousness is imputed to them through Faith And thus in a sound Scripture Sense Christ's People are actually justified by Faith as respecting looking to and receiving the Righteousness of Christ Jesus But every Soul who is destitute of this Faith in Jesus is in a State of Wrath and under the Sentence of Condemnation by the just and holy Law of GOD And surely that Soul who is possessed of this  precious Faith  Pet i This  Faith of GOD's Elect  cannot will not dare not depreciate or despise it lest he should thereby  only  lightly esteem the Gift and do Despite to the  Author and Finisher of  Faith which is Jesus But no Wonder that through the Blindness of the Understanding and the Hardness and Impenitence of the Heart those who are Strangers to this heavenly Gift should deny its Existence and explode the holy and blessed Effects which  as the Scripture abundantly testify do flow from it None but such Persons would dare to assert that  "  Antichrist  says you are justified by your own Faith which will produce Righteousness in you to evidence it"  Sure I am from the Word of GOD  that  Faith which doth not produce any Fruits of Righteousness and true Holi  s to evidence it is not only an  Antinomian  Fancy but an antichri  an Delusion begotten by Ignorance and Error nourished and supported by vain Confidence and Delusion at the expence of Truth  perventing the Word of GOD  Wilt thou know O vain Man that Faith without Works is dead  James ii  Faith is described by St  Paul  as  the Substance of Things hoped for  Evidence of Things not seen  Heb ii for it gives  Subsistence  to  Reality in the Minds of Believers of those Things which Unbe  vers know nothing of It is the  Evidence  to the Souls of the Faithful of those Blessings and Comforts which he who believeth not  no Conception of Such as the Pardon of Sin the Love of GOD  abroad in the Heart Peace of Conscience Joy in the Holy Ghost  c  As the Love of GOD the Father is evidenced in the Gospel by the Gift of his Son Jesus Christ for the Salvation of lost S  ers so the Evidence that any Sinner hath of this Love to his own Soul is by Faith Therefore it is said by St  Peter to you who be  ve Christ is precious  Pet ii For though  Jesus  is described  the Word as altogether lovely in his Person desirable in his Offices and precious in his Work of Salvation yet it is by Faith he is known and received so as to be esteemed loved and admired to the Saints Comfort Justification and eternal Salvation Hence  to as  ny as received him  saith St  John    to them gave he Power to become  e Sons of GOD even to them who believe on his Name  John i  nd that Sinners might believe in him and receive Justification and  ife through him he again testifies  John  xx  These Things are  itten that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of GOD  d that  believing  ye might have Life through his Name  And our  ord asserts  he that believeth is passed from Death unto Life  I have cited these few Passages from holy Writ to shew the happy  te and rich Privileges which Sinners are brought into and invested  ith through Faith They are passed from Death to Life enjoy the  ower or Privilege of being the Sons of GOD and receive Life from  sus Whereas before they have obtained precious Faith and know  e Truth their State is described by the Apostle as being  without  rist Aliens from the Commonwealth of  Israel  having no Hope and  out GOD in the World  Eph ii And why is it that GOD's  People are thus highly favoured but because GOD of his sovereign Grace hath been pleased to connect their Holiness and Happiness with his own Glory and it is through Faith these inestimable Blessings are communicated to the Soul and therefore all those who are  the Children of GOD by Faith in Christ Jesus  are called to  serve GOD without Fear in Holiness and Righteousness before him all the Days of their Life  They are concerned to  glorify GOD in their Body and Spirit  And it is the Command of their Saviour that they should  let their Light so shine before Men that they may see their good Works and glorify their Father who is in Heaven  Matt v Hope and Love are inseparable from true Faith Who can love GOD but those who believe the Love of GOD toward them in Christ Jesus  We love GOD because he first loved us  John iv And  this is the Love of GOD that we keep his Commandments  chap v iii From Faith in Jesus springs Hope the Hope of seeing and enjoying GOD which hath a cleansing Efficacy For  every one who hath this Hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure  John iii Thus there is a sweet Connection between  the Work of Faith the Labour of Love and the Patience of Hope  The Members of Jesus find it so  To him who believeth all Things are possible  To him that loveth all Things are easy for  GOD's Commandments are not grievous  A  d  Hope is as an Anchor to the Soul both sure and stedfast  whereby it is saved from splitting on the Rocks of unchristian Libertinism preserved from being swallowed up by the Quicksands of Antinomian Licentiousness and by patient continuing in  Welldoing  is looking for the Mercy of our Lord Jesus unto eternal Life  Such are the natural Fruits such the genuine Effects such the certain Evidence of a vital operative victorious Faith in Christ Say ye Happy because believing Members of Christ ye who rely on the Atonement of his Blood for the Pardon of your Sins and conside in the Righteousness of Jesus for your Justification say doth not this Belief excite the most irreconcileable Abhorrence of all Ungodliness Doth not this Faith most powerfully incite to evangelical Obedience to all Holiness of Life and PracticeAs  in the la  Days Scoffers will come  saith the Apostle  walking after their own Lusts  I would stir up your pure Minds by way of Remembrance for Beloved  Hath GOD from the Beginning chosen you to Salvation it i  through Sanctification of the Spirit and Belief of the Truth  Thes ii  Are ye called in Time  it is with a holy Calling that as he which hath called you is holy so should ye be holy in all Manner of Conversation  Pet i  Hath Christ given himself for you it was that he might  redeem you from all Iniquity  and also  purify you unto himself a peculiar People zealous of good Works  Titus ii that ye being dead to Sin should live unto Righteousness  Are you GOD's Workmanship created anew in Christ Jesus  it is unto good Works which GOD hath before ordained that you should walk in them  Eph ii  Do you know the Gospel of the Grace of GOD in Truth it  teacheth you to deny all Ungodliness and worldly Lusts and to live soberly righteously and godly in this present World  Titus ii  Hath GOD given unto you exceeding great and precious Promises it is that you should  c  a  se yourselves from all Fil  hiness of Flesh and Spirit perfecting Holiness in the Fear of GOD  Cor vii  Are you united to Jesus and become one with him as the Branch is with the Vine  herein is your heavenly Father glorified that ye bear much Fruit  John xv  Do you abide in Christ as Members of his mystical Body  He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as Christ also walked  John ii The Head JESUS hath left his Members an Example that they should follow his Steps  Are you become dead to the Law by the Body of Christ and are you married to Jesus by Faith it is to this very End  that ye should bring forth Fruit unto GOD  Rom vii  Fruits of Righteousness which are by Jesus Christ Fruit unto Holiness and your End shall be everlasting Life  Thus is Jesus glorified in his believing Members His Gospel is adorned by them Gratitude to GOD for his Grace is expressed fellow Creatures and fellow Christians are profited And thus a holy precious Faith in the Hearts of GOD's Elect is proved to be an operative Grace is attended with the Fruits of Righteousness evidenced by good Works and  made perfect b  them  James ii in Contradistinction to unfruitful Notions in the Head meer carnal and unscriptural Ideas of  Union  the Creature of Fancy or the Whim of the Imagination which leaves its Professors in the Possession of a  Dead Faith  productive of no Fruit to the Glory of GOD no Good  o Man nor to those who rest in it is it of any avail unless to  ar the Conscience and lull it into a fatal Security nor can it  attended with any Advantage but with an awful Disappointment  to such who are satisfied with it in that Day when GOD shall judge the Secrets of all Hearts by Jesus ChristBut there is not wanting a Cloud of Witnesses as an incontestible Proof of the Nature and Evidences of a true Faith and that by it the Worthies of Old  wrought Righteousness  c their Names and their Works stand on Record in the eleventh Chapter to the  Hebrews  as a stimulating Example to all succeeding Believers and as a Contrast to all carnal dissolute and licentious Professors of the Religion of the Bible  Thus in full Contradiction to this  Author  's whimsieal Notion of  Union  the Scriptures abundantly shew and declare what is the Nature of a real vital Union of Christ with Believers by the Fruits and Effects which result from it And thereby fully refute the hardned impious Assertions of those who count it  Antichristian  to insist on the Fruits of Faith And surely before any Person can imbibe this Author's Principles he must attain some of his jesuitical Cunning in corrupting the plain Sense of Scripture in wresting and perverting the obvious Meaning of the Word of GOD in order to support unscriptural and unchristian Positions and to the encouraging Licentiousness of Life and Conversation St  Paul  describes such Persons as those  who walk in the Vanity of their Minds having the Understanding darkened being alienated from the Life of GOD through the Ignorance that is in them because of the Blindness of their Hearts who being past Feeling have given themselves over to work all Uncleanness with Greediness  Eph iv But of the real Members of Christ true Believers the Apostle gives a very different Description  But ye have not so learned Christ if so be ye that have heard him and have been taught by him as the Truth is in Jesus that ye put off concerning the former Conversation the old Man which is corrupt according to the deceitful Lusts and be renewed in the Spirit of your Mind and that ye put on the new Man which after GOD is created in Righteousness and true Holiness  ver c  CHAP IV  In Contradistinction to Mr  Relly  's Tenets a Change of State and Practice shewed to be necessary to eternal Glory That this is effected upon the Members of Jesus to his Glory and their present Happiness and Holiness by the Power and Agency of the divine Spirit upon their Souls whereby they are prepared and made meet for the heavenly Inheritance  IN the last Chapter we have seen the Effects of a truly Christian Faith rejected in this we shall see the Cause denied by thi  Author  viz  that spiritual and supernatural Change which passeth upon the Heart and State of Believers under the Agency and Influence of the Holy Spirit producing Repentance unto Life Faith unto Justification and Sanctification unto Holiness of Heart and Life Now Jesus is truly glorified by these divine Effects appearing in his Members whereby the Understanding which is naturally dark is enlightened The Will which is stubborn and contrary to the Will of GOD is bowed and brought into Subjection and the Affections which are alienated from GOD and his Truths are brought to love and esteem Jesus and the Way of Salvation by him  Though to save Appearance of not  totally  denying the Work of the Spirit Mr  Relly  is pleased to tell us  p  he  "would not be understood of speaking lightly of the Spirit of Truth or of his Operations upon the Heart of Man according to the Scripture Account thereof which is there undeniably made to consist in receiving the Things which are his  viz  Christ and in shewing them to us that Jesus alone might be glorified"  But I would ask and appeal to Scripture is this the only Work and Office of the Holy Spirit Is there no Work wrought by his divine Energy in and upon the Heart of GOD's People The Scriptures fully prove there is and the People of GOD in every Age have from real Experience testified of it For by Nature they are  Children of Wrath dead in Trespasses and Sins and Enemies in their Minds to GOD by wicked Works  Therefore a Change both of State and Practice is absolutely necessary to eternal Glory Nor could they be meet to partake of it unless the Holy Spirit effected this which he doth according to the Word of Truth by quickening and regenerating their Souls they are made to partake of a  new Birth  into a new State and  Kingdom they are  delivered from the Power of Darkness and translated into the Kingdom of GOD's dear Son  Col i By the Holy Ghost they are enlightened convinced of Sin Faith is wrought in their Hearts by his Power  Repentance unto Salvation is granted  unto them they are sanctified and led by the Spirit and through the Spirit are enabled to mortify the Deeds of the Body  Rom  viii GOD's  Spirit bears Witness with their Spirits that they are the Children of GOD  chap viii  And seals them unto the Day of eternal Redemption  Eph iv Thus doth the Scripture of Truth testify of the Work of the Spirit on the Hearts of the Members of Jesus producing these holy and happy Effects But in direct Opposition to all this Hear Mr  Relly  's Declaration  "the Spirit of Error pretends to shew Mankind other Excellencies than what are found in Jesus Such as Reformation Changes pious Motions and Desires in themselvesAntrchrist or the false Christ seeks not the Glory of Jesus but speaks of himself of its own Operations of Joys Sorrows Hatred to Evil languishing after Goodness by him wrought in the Heart"  c  "This is that Spirit which I have set my Face against and of which I speak where ever I have through my Book ranked this Phrase  the Work of the Spirit on the Hear    among the cant Terms of  Judaism  blended with  Heathenism  After the Recital of this it must be granted where the Conscience  is hardned through the Deceitfulness of Sin and seared as with an hot Iron  against all Sense of Sin Persons in such a State are quite free from any Sense of  Sorrow Hatred of Evil languishing after Goodness Reformation Changes pious Motions and Desires in themselves  c And consequently they may account all this as  Judaism  with blended  Heathenism  or give it any other cant Term which their corrupt Imagination can coin But I appeal to every one who has been  taught the Truth as it is in Jesus  and have experienced the inwrought Principles of Light and Life Grace and Holiness communicated from Jesus by the Power of the Spirit whether a Sight and Sense of Sin Sorrow and Remorse for it Humiliation under it Hatred of it pious Motions and Desires after Goodness  c  is not the very Temper and Disposition of Heavenborn Souls Is it not consistent perfectly consistent with the Purity of the Doctrine and Genius of the Gospel and flows from the Work of the Spirit of Truth on the Heart And as to Joys if there be any Consolation it is in Christ Jesus and flows from him as the Head to the Hearts of his Members through the Power of the Holy Spirit Hence a Fruit of the Spirit is called  Joy  and  Joy in the Holy Ghost  Rom xiv is of the Essence of the Kingdom of Jesus and it is an apostolia  Prayer for Saints  that GOD would fill them  not only  with Peace  but  all Joy in believing  chap xv Is not this then the Work of the  Spirit of Truth  upon the Heart Doth he not hereby glorify Jesus in Truth and Reality in his Members Thus it is true it is the Office of the Spirit of Truth to take of the Things of Christ and shew them unto us To us to whom What to dead blind Sinners who have neither Eyes to see nor Life spiritual Life to receive Comfort and Consolation therefrom For it is an adjudged C  se of our Lord  except a Man is born again of the Spirit he cannot  see  the Kingdom of GOD  John iii agreeable to which St  Paul  testifies  the natural Man  receiveth  not the Things of the Spirit they are Foolishness  him neither can he know  them  because they are spiritually  discerned  Cor  ii Hence nothing can be more clear and plain than that spiritual Illumination and a real and spiritual Change is wrought upon the Souls of GOD's People  As to this Author's declaring his Enmity to and setting his Face against i  is only a farther Proof that the Scripture is not the Rule of his Faith and that it is to be feared he is ignorant of this Work of the Spirit upon his own Heart and so joins the Enemies of Truth to speak against those Things he knows not of If he did he would in Reality attempt what he talks much about  viz  to  glorify Jesus in Truth  For herein is the Saviour glorified indeed when a Sinner is awa  ned to a Sight of his Misery quickened to feel his Wants made s  nsible of his Condemnation by the Law convicted of his own Vile  ss and Guilt and the Insufficiency of his own Righteousness and  to Jesus as the  only City of Refuge  looks to the  Lamb of GOD  TAKETH  away the Sin of the World  John i to have Guilt  emoved from his Conscience through his precious Blood alone and has Recourse to his Righteousness  only  for Justification yea to his whole  ished Work on Earth as the only and alone Ground and Foundation of his Acceptance with GOD also to the Mediation and Inter  ssion of Christ to be  kept through Faith unto Salvation  in a Way of Holiness unto eternal Glory Thus the Holy Spirit leads a Sinner  all Truth  into the Knowledge of his own State the Law and  stice of GOD the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Jesus his  magnifying  Law fulfilling all Righteousness  and purchasing Salvation for him  he might be Partaker of his Holiness unto Life eternalSurely  we behold the sovereign Display of the eternal Love of Jehovah  Grace of our precious Redeemer and the divine Energy of the Holy  rit Thus is the Father honoured the Son glorified and the Spirit  magnified and thus the glorious and eternal Three bear Record on Earth in the Salvation of Sinners This may draw a Sneer from the antiscriptural De  st may meet with Contempt from the Abettors of the  Sabellian  Heresy and have the Appearance of Madness to the mee  formal Professors of Christianity But true Christians who have learned of the Father to come to Jesus through the Power of the Spirit know this to be sc  iptural and experimental Christianity and the Ground of their Hope the Stay of their Confidence the Refuge of their Souls the Stability of their Comfort and the Joy of their Heart is a crucified Saviour a risen Lord Jesus dying for their Sins and rising again for their Justification Nor can they turn from his Blood and Righteousness to advert to any other Matter or Object for Hope or Salvation And why is this but because they know Jesus hath done all  for  them by his Obedience and Death he hath wrought all  in  them by hi  Holy Spirit whereby they know his Love apply and appropriate Jesus Christ to their Souls by Faith find and feel they are  Partakers of the divine Nature  are animated by Love and strengthened by Grace to all Obedience and Holiness in their Lives and Conversation  But these Christexalting Views these Sinmortifying Holiness producing Operations are impiously ascribed to the Workings of the Spirit of Antichrist and deem'd the Marks of the false Christ and this under a specious Pretence that to establish these is to oppose and degrade the true Christ the SaviourThis is just as good Reasoning as to say whoever pretends to feel the comforting Warmth  Influences enlivening and invigorating Rays of the Sun doth thereby eclipse his Splendor rob him of his Glory and deny the real  xistence of that heavenly Luminary Or to assert that if the blind Ma  whom our Lord restored to Sight believed or declared that he en+joyed Sight  in himself  he would thereby detract from the Glory o  Jesus who is the Light of Men Or that the  Leper  who came to Christ with  Lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean  if he declared he found in himself that he was cleansed from his Leprosy by Jesus he would thereby depreciate the Author of his Cure and rob Chri  of his Glory Now who that is not destitute of Reason and Under+standing would argue thus Nor doth it display less Ignorance of th  Word of GOD and the Power of the Gospel of Christ and the Energy of the Holy Spirit to assert that it derogates from the Glory of Christ because his Members experience a real and spiritual Change in the Souls are  born again of the Spirit  have their  Hearts purified Faith  are passed from their old natural State to a new holy State Christ from a Death in Sin to a Life of Righteousness from a can  to a spiritual State and hence they are said to be  not in the Flesh but in the Spirit  Rom viii and the Spirit of Jesus dwells in them by whom they are disposed and influenced to a holy righteous and spiritual Walk and Conversation the inward Sanctification of their Souls shews itself by outward Holiness of Life and Practice and to the Glory of GOD there ever was and now is a Cloud of Wit  esses who from inward Knowledge and Experience have borne their Testimony to the Truth hereof in Opposition to all the vain Speculations unscriptural Assertions and licentious Tenets of such who profess to know GOD but in Works deny Him  CHAP V  Christian Obedience and the Practice of good Works or a walking so as to please GOD insisted upon and enforced from Gospel Principles in Opposition to the licentious Tenets advanced by Mr  Relly  a Text vilely mangled and basely cited by him to attempt to make Christ a Minister of Sin and a Discourager of Holiness Goodness Virtue  c  his Practice herein detected and exposed  LET us next see how vehemently this Author declaims against good Works and asserts roundly that  "Mankind are incapable of performing Actions spiritually good at any Time and that when Men begin to consider them as spiritually good as wellpleasing and acceptable with GOD as Righteousness Holiness or Fruitfulness before him or when making this their Sanctification they go about to prove their Faith thereby inwardly respecting these Motions as Proofs and Marks of their Grace and Christianity I say when this is the Case with ardent Zeal tenfold more burning than ever they can shew for the Works of their Hands we will prove all their Righteousness to be filthy Rags"  p  and  Here is a Spark of Truth and a Blaze of Error For as to the Works of their own Hands done in a natural sinful unregenerate State according to the Will of the Flesh before the Grace of Christ and the Inspiration of his Spirit they as the th Article of the Church of  England  scripturally teacheth  "are not pleasing to GOD forasmuch as they spring not of Faith in Jesus Christ"  c  These Works every true Believer has been taught to disclaim All his own Righteousness which is of the Law done from legal Principles to gain the Favour of GOD and merit Salvation he looks on  as filthy  Rags  counts as Dross and Dung desires to be found in Christ and will make mention of his Righteousness only for the Acceptance of his Person in Life in Death and a  his tremendous Bar He knows he is not sufficient of himself to any thing that is good but that his Sufficiency is of GOD and therefore with the Church of old will confess  Thou O Lord hast wrought all our Works in us  Isa  xxvi  But let this Author's  Zeal  his  ardent Zeal  his tenfold more burning  Zeal  be as raging and as furious as the most violent Eruptions of  Aetna  or  Vesicvius  authorise  by divine Authority supported by inward Experience we will testify and declare what Jesus hath wrought  in  us by his Spirit as a Consequence of what he hath done  f  r  us in his Person and which we will call spiritually good because produced by a good and holy Agent For  the Fruits of the Spirit are Love Joy Peace Lon su  ering Gentleness Goodness Faith Meekness Temperance  c These Things wrought in us by the Holy Ghost we count spiritually good And the Apostle proves them to be so for he says  against such there is noLaw  Gal v yea and we will assert these Things are  wellpleasing and acceptable to GOD  for this plain Reason because  it is GOD who worketh in us both to  will  and to  do  of his good Pleasure  Eph ii and it is  through the Blood of the everlasting Covenant that the Lord makes us perfect in every  good Work  to do his Will working in us that which is  wellpleasing  in his Sight through Jesus Christ  Heb xiii For surely what is GOD's Will and good Pleasure to work in and by his People must in the Nature of Things be good wellpleasing and acceptable in his Sight To say otherwise must be ascribing the grossest Absurdity to GOD yea the most shocking Blasphemy against him Thus are Believers  inwardly  sanctified through Faith in the Blood of Jesus and by the Power of his Spirit unto actual Holiness of Heart and Life to which they are called and are  strengthened by the Spirit in the inner Man to delight in the Law of GOD  and to  Fruitfulness  in every good Word and Work And to confront this Author's Assertion St  Paul  exhorts Believers  to do Good  and to communicate expressly asserting that with such  Sacrifices GOD is wellpleased  Heb xiii  As in the first Creation the Almighty Fiat called forth Fruit from the Earth and it was so So likewise in the  new Creation  in the Souls of Believers the same sovereign Voice in his Word through the Power of his Spirit calls forth Fruitfulness of the inward Graces in the Heart and the outward Fruits of good Works  in the Life of new Creatures of whom it is said  the Seed of GOD remaineth in them  John iii And though the Earth is of itself sluggish inert Matter incapable of producing Fruits yet as it is impregnated by the influence of the Elements Vegetation and Fruitfulness is increased so in the new Creation Believers who are in their natural and earthly State dead and inactive to spiritual Actions yet under the Influences of GOD's Spirit through Means he is pleased to own and bless such as attending the Ordinances Prayer Reading Meditation the Gospel preached  c  through Faith in Christ Jesus the Soul is made Fruitful in Knowledge Love and Obedience  c  and  increaseth with the Increase of GOD  Col ii in such Things as are good acceptable and wellpleasing to GOD through Jesus Christ Thus St  Paul  writes to Believers  We beseech you Brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to  PLEASE  GOD so you would  ABOUND  more and more  Thes iv And the beloved Disciple  John  iii testifies  we keep his Commandments and do those Things which are  pleasing  in his Sight  Thus doth it appear that Jesus is Sanctification to his Members Being united to him they derive Sanctification from him inwardly in their Souls which shews itself outwardly in a holy Walk And indeed the very End of Believers being dead to the Law to all Hopes and Expectations of obtaining Salvation for the Sake of their own Works is that being influenced by evangelical Principles Faith and Love they might  live unto GOD  Hence saith he  Sin shall not have the Dominion over you  that believe  because ye are not under the Law but under Grace  Rom vi Not under Fears of Wrath and Hell but under a Sense of Love and Salvation And what Inference doth the Apostle draw from hence Doth he join with the licentious and horrid Assertion so much used by some in this our Day  "The more Sin you commit the more Glory you bring to the Merits of Christ"  No he detests and abhors such Language  What then shall we sin because we are not under the Law but under Grace GOD forbid  ver And every one who is influenced by the same Spirit by whose Teaching  Paul  wrote will join him and say  far from it  Thus in every Point of View we see the Doctrines of Grace are  according to Godliness  they have no Tendency to Libertinism and Licentiousness Neither discourage the Performance of good Works nor encourage in Sin but lead to Holiness in all Manner of Conversation and to those Things which are spiritually good wellpleasing and acceptable with GOD It is true there were from the Beginning  those who  wrested the Scripture to their own Destruction  perverted the Truths of GOD  ungodly Mex who turned the Grace of GOD i e  the Doctrines of the Gospel of the Grace of GOD  into Lasciviousness  So it is in this our Day Is not the Author of UNION  c  acting thus Do not his Writings fully prove it For according to Mr  Relly  's Doctrine neither the Law nor the Gospel the Fear nor the Love of GOD ever produce any Effect or Influence in the Life and Conversation of Christians of a good holy or righteous Nature Nay so far is he from teaching or exhorting Men to this that he is at the Pains according to his usual and very ingenuous Method to mangle a Text to discourage and reprove what he deems such unchristian Practice  Thus says this Author  p    "Our Saviour reproved the Church of  Laodicea  in the sharpest Manner for growing rich and increasing in Goods  c  Here is another glaring Instance of this Writer's handling the Word of GOD deceitfully It is not sufficient with him to deny and oppose the plain Truths of GOD but he also takes the Liberty to mutilate the Sense and alter the Meaning thereof For there is no such Reproof to be found in all the Book of GOD On the Contrary St  Paul  exhorts Believers  to do Good and be rich in good Works  Tim vi The plain Truth here is our Saviour's Reprehension of the Church was  because thou sayest I am rich  c which Words this Author has omitted for what Reason he is best able to say but we have the Liberty to judge when this was not the Case She fancied her State to be what in reality it was not as the Text  Rev  iii fully shews Therefore our Saviour so far from reproving the Church of  Laodicea  for being rich and increased in Goods in a spiritual Sense that he gives her Advice in the next Verse how she might become so  I counsel th  e to buy of me Gold tried in the Fire that thou mayest be rich  c  Now what a shocking Perversion of our Lord's Meaning is here If this is not attempting what St  Paul  detested with the utmost Abhorence  viz  making  Christ a Minister of Sin  'tis hard to say what is But this is not all More horrid still is this Author's next Assertion  "Antichrist says you must grow Rich rich in Wisdom Knowledge Holiness Goodness Virtue and Experience"  Daring Impiety unparalelled Blasphemy Thus to ascribe the Doctrine of  the Amen the Faithful and true Witness  to the teachings of Antichrist But charming News quieting Dose this pleasing enough such Doctrine is to those who are  hardened through the Deceitfulness of Sin and commit Iniquity with Greediness who profess to know GOD but in Works  deny him being abominable and disobedient and to every good Work reprobate  Titus i  To deny Holiness and good Works as having any Part in the Gospel System to explode Wisdom Goodness Virtue and Experience as being contrary to the genius of Christianity and to strike out a Way of Salvation by Union with Christ which leaves Men in a sinful State under the reigning Power and uncontrouled Dominion of their Sins and Lusts Such a Creed will well suit the State and Practice of too many in our Day And therefore will be readily received eagerly embraced and find Votaries enough to subscribe to it There were such of Old GOD complains of them by the Mouth of  Jer  vii  c behold ye trust in lying Words which cannot profit Will ye steal murder and commit Adultery  c  And say we are delivered to do all these Abominations  But surely before any Christian can receive and admit such dissolute and licentious Principles he must give up his Bible treat the Doctrines of Christianity with the utmost Contempt despise and reject the teachings of Christ himself and ridicule the inspired Penmen for so sadly misrepresenting the Nature of true Christianity  For  nothing can be more plain than that the Purpose End and Design of the Book of GOD is to animate and encourage stir up and exhort those who are united to the Lord Jesus  to depart from all Iniquity to be holy in all Manner of Conversation to walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing to be fruitful in every good Work and to increase in the Knowledge of GOD  Col i and to abound more and more in Holiness Goodness and Experience c  to the Praise of the Glory of his Grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved  Eph i  CHAP VI  Mr  Relly  's Positions contrasted with the Word of GOD his Aversion to Scripture Language and Scripture Doctrine exhibited A short View of his absurd Figment of  UNION  awful Effects of his Tenets terminating in the most licentious and detestable Consequences  AS a farther Specimen of this Author's rejecting and opposing the plain Truths of Scripture by describing them as the Marks of  the false Christ for the sake of Brevity I will now present to the World in a contrasted View with this Interrogation  Who is on the Lord's Side who  Thesis  Antithesis  Â   Scripture Exhortations to and Descriptio  s of true Christians real Believers in the Lord Jesus  Page  Mr  Relly  says the false

Wonders  LIE NOT ONE TO ANOTHER Col iii  There shall be false Teachers among you  Pet ii But  he that is of GOD heareth GOD's Word  John viii  I need not pursue the Contrast What I have adduced is sufficient to shew the Difference of this Author's Sentiments with the Word of GOD Conviction of Sin Conversion to GOD Faith Holiness Heavenlymindedness  c  he describes as the Signs and great Wonders which the false Christ can shew But let the Christian World judge who is Antichristian and who speaks under the Influence of the Spirit of Faslhood and Error Though perhaps  the Christian Reader may be at a Loss to account why this Author should thus display his Talents in perverting and opposing the plain Declarations of Scripture I would remind him all this is done according to Mr  Relly  's System to  glorify Jesus  And sure it must be confessed that he takes just as an effectual Method to do this as though a Person should pretend great Love to his present Majesty and profess all Zeal and Loyalty to his Crown and Government but  hould nevertheless  only  counterfeit his Coin encourage his Subjects  o Rebellion advise them to throw off the Yoke of Subjection and  ell them it is  Damnably  criminal to yield Obedience to his Laws Proclamations and Edicts and all this to support and maintain an  d Whim or Chimera he had got in his Head of the UNION that subsists between the King and his Subjects So that every individual Subject constitutes a Part and the Whole collectively con  red makes up the King's natural Body Hence each individual Person being Part of the King has a Right to do what seems good in his own Eyes Equally as absurd and ridiculous neither supported by solid Reason or Scripture Truths but contrary to and inconsistent with both is this Author's Figment of  Union  A Notion begot by  nal Ideas and hatched from gross Conceptions which he attempts to establish instead of that mystical and spiritual Union which the Scripture declares subsists between Christ and Believers As a full Proof of this I need only subjoin two Positions from the many which which might be extracted equally as absurd and unscriptural  The Author of UNION  c  in order to supersede the Practice of confessing and forsaking Sin in our own Person asserts this till  unheard of Doctrine  P    "As the Promise is to such who confess and forsake their Sin it is fulfilled upon us in Jesus all the Promises of GOD being in him Yea and in him Amen  There  have we with all the Prayers and Supplications strong Crying and Tears which Jesus offered in the Days of his Flesh confessed our Sins unto GOD and where He having purged our Sins appeared the second Time without Sin unto Salvation  we have eternally forsaken them  "  There has been a great Cry among this Author's Votaries that his Treatise UNION is unanswerable Or why say they doth not some Person answer it  er it I have heard that the late Orator  Henley  whose Advertisements were  countably odd and whimsical once published a pecuniary Reward to any one  would  answer  him Upon which a Person offered double the Money to any that could  understand  his Writings and explain his Meaning This is much the  with the Author of UNION To understand him is very difficult to explain Meaning almost impossible So much unintelligible Bombast Falshood andNonsense is seldom to be met with in an Author as are contained in these few Sentences What can he mean by these two Adverbs  There  and  Where  "  T  have we confessed our Sins And  where  he having purged our Sins appeared the second Time without Sin unto Salvation we have eternally forsaken them"  There  and  where  being Adverbs of Place leaves the Reader in Perplexity and c  founds the Sense Suppose we supply the Sense of reading with  then  and  when  A  verbs of Time But though the Sense is gained yet the Falshood is manifest For  First  This Text  H  b  ix runs thus  Christ was once offered to bear the S  many and unto them who look for him  shall  e appear the second Time without Sin  Salvation  This doubtless refers to the future Appearing of Jesus in his glorif  Form when every Eye shall see him to the Terror and Confusion of some a  to the ineffable Joy and eternal Salvation of others Now this Period of Time  yet to come as this Appearing of Jesus is not accomplished therefore it is  from hence to assert that we  have  eternally forsaken our Sins A  d  The Falshood of this Author's Argument is farther evident from the D  clarat  of the beloved Disciple  John  i  If we confess our Sins GOD is fait  ful a  just to forgive us our Sins  c Now he wrote these Words after Jesus had  up his Prayers and Supplications strong Cryings and Tears in the Days of his  And it is plain he knew of no such Doctrine as Mr  Relly  has broached of o  confessing Sins before we had any Existence On the Contrary he writes to e  courage Believers to the Confession of Sin unto GOD in their own Persons according to the Tenor of GOD's Word  He that confesseth and forsaketh his Sin  find Mercy  Prov xxviii And as all the Promises are in Jesus Yea and Am  the Apostle therefore declares GOD is  faithful  to his Word of Promise and  to forgive us our Sins But from this Author's Reasoning it doth not appear th  either he or those he includes in his Pronoun  we  have confessed their Sins at all much less that they have forsaken them least of all that they have  et  nally  forsaken them and consequently they have no Warrant from the Word of G  conclude that their Sins are forgiven to this very Day And yet Mr  Relly  is ple  to declare  page    "When Men who are Strangers unto this  Union  take it up them to expound the Scripture it is amazing to see with what Contradiction  Inconsistencies it abounds"  Amazing indeed A more flagrant Proof sure  was exhibited  Downright Falshood and Nonsense  Again  Page    "He Christ in us and  we  in him have fulfilled all Righteousness fully kept the Commandments of GOD and suffered the Punishment due to our Sins"  What Heresy and Absurdity is this Need we be surprised if we should hear this Author next assert this impious and horrid Blasphemy  Christ in us and we in Christ created all Things and without  us  was not any Thing made which is made  I appeal Is there not as much Propriety from Scripture and Reason to say this as to assert that in any Sense we suffered the Punishment due to our Sins  Thus doth this Author by such gross Absurdity confound the Persons of Jesus and the Sinner the Redeemer and the Redeemed So as to pervert and destroy the plain Sense and Meaning of Scripture It is asserted  Christ redeemed  us  to GOD by his precious Blood He gave himself  FOR us  the Just  FOR  the  Unjust  Christ hath suffered  FOR  us  c The Scriptures are clear and determinate on this Point The Sense plain and obvious But this Author's Treatise abounds with senseless Jargon  and serves to no other Use and Purpose but to subvert the Christian Doctrine render the Word of GOD of none Effect and to establish a Set of Notions in the Minds of Mankind which are diametrically opposite to the Word of GOD destructive of the Faith and Practice of Christianity and tend to steel Men's Minds against Conviction and sear the Consciences while they abound in open Profaneness Sensuality and Ungodliness Hence we see and hear of many who once seemed to run well in the Ways of Godliness but Satan has now hindered by these pernicious Tenets and they now  glory in their Shame sporting themselves with the  r own Dec  ivings  who  make a m  ck of Sin  ridicule serious Godliness despise and neglect all the Ordinances of Christianity make a ba  er of Prayer  c  Exploding all these Things as proceeding from a legal Spirit and the Result of a selfright  ous Disposition and yet all this while they talk much of and pretend to glory much in their Notion of  Union  their being one with Christ that they were with Christ in the Manger and with him on the Cross  c  and tho' their Faith and Practice be ever so dissonant with the Gospel of Christ yet indeed there can be no doubt of their being with Christ on his Throne of Glory provided only their grand  Catholicon  universal Salvation be true This Sovereign Remedy may at present hush the Fears silence the Clamours of Conscience and be called in as the last Resource of Hope that all will be well at the last if as they say all Mankind are saved and will be made finally Happy This Opinion is at the bottom of this Author's Treatise which I have  First  Attempted to refute And therefore hav shew'd  Secondly  That Repentence unto Life Faith unto Justification Sanctification unto personal Holiness of Heart and Life is intirely rejected by this Author's System For as a natural Consequence he denies  Thirdly  That there is any Change or Alteration wrought in or pass  s upon the Souls of GOD's People under the Energy and Influence of the Holy Spirit either respecting their State or Practice for what is done by them or wrought in them under the Grace and Assistance of the Holy Spirit is ascribed by him to the workings of the Spirit of Antichrist And therefore  Fourthly All Scripture  is no longer to be Esteemed as poor mistaken  Pa  l  affirms  Tim  iii  As given by Inspiration of GOD and profitable for Doctrine for Repr  for Correction for Instruction in Righteousness that the Man of GOD may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good Wor    No  r  Fifthly  A very great Portion of the Word of GOD according to Mr  Relly  's Doctrine is to no Use End or Purpose vain and insignificant  are all the Exhortations Cautions Counsels and Reproofs which are directed to Believers from the Prophets and Apostles yea and from our Lord's own Mouth also that the Members of Jesus might watch and pray strive against Sin mortify their Lusts subdue their Corruptions and grow in Grace and abound in the Fruits of Holiness So of Consequence it follows  Lastly  That in the Sight of GOD there is no Difference between a Life of no  orious Ungodliness open Profaneness and Sensuality and true Believers being enabled through Grace to depart from all Iniquity to deny Ungodliness and worldly Lusts and to live soberly righteously and godly in this present World so as to adorn the Doctrine of GOD our Saviour in all Things living and walking in the Spirit so as not to fulfil the Lusts of the Flesh But on the Contrary that such Practices as the unconverted  Corinthians  abounded in of Adultery Drunkenness Thieving Lusts  c  are equally as wellpleasing to GOD as after they were washed sanctified justified and become new Creatures in Christ Jesus in Heart and Life  Now who that has felt the Comfort and Power of the Gospel of the Grace of GOD but must detest and abhor such abominable Principles Who that has any Love to  the Truth as it is in Jesus  but must be fired with a holy Indignation against such Tenets Who that has any Concern for the Glory of GOD the Good of Mankind and the Benefit of Society but must be warmed with a Christian Zeal against such Doctrines Who that has any Care for his present Peace any Hope of seeing and enjoying GOD and the Lamb but will be concerned to exercise a holy Jealousy over himself lest he be drawn away by the Errors of the Wicked and be corrupted from the Simplicity of the GospelBut obnoxious as these Principles are in their Nature and pernicious in their Consequences yet as to the Persons who retain them Christian Love will excite to Pity and influence to Prayer  if peradventure GOD will grant them Repentance unto the Acknowledgement of the Truth And that they may recover themselves out of the Snare of th  Devil who are taken captive by him at his Will  FINIS
