 AN ESSAY ON MUSICAL EXPRESSION  By CHARLES AVISON  Organist  in NEWCASTLE  With ALTERATIONS and Large ADDITIONS  To which is added A LETTER to the AUTHOR concerning the Music of the ANCIENTS and some Passages in CLASSIC WRITERS relating to that Subject  LIKEWISE Mr AVISON's REPLY to the Author of  Remarks on the Essay on  MUSICAL EXPRESSION In a Letter from Mr  Avison  to his Friend in  London  THE THIRD EDITION  LONDON Printed for LOCKYER DAVIS in  Holborn  Printer to the ROYAL SOCIETY MDCCLXXV  ADVERTISEMENT  AS there are several musical terms which will frequently occur in the course of this Essay and which are not always sufficiently attended to it may therefore be necessary for the sake of those who are not particularly conversant in Music to explain them according to their most general acceptation  And first the term MELODY may be defined the  means  or method of ranging  single  musical sounds in a regular progression either ascending or descending according to the established principles  HARMONY is the method of ranging two or more  concording  musical sounds or the agreeable  union  of them in several parts when sung or played together As therefore a continued succession of  single  musical sounds produces  melody  so does a continued  combination  of these produce  harmony  MODULATION is the effect of  single  or  concording  musical sounds succeeding one another in an  arbitrary  but  agreeable  progression passing from one  key  to another and therefore doth as well relate to  combined  as to  single  musical sounds  BY the word  Key  is meant a regular succession of any eight  natural notes  the lowest note being considered as the  principal  is therefore called the  keynote  all  the other notes in that key being subordinate to it  CADENCES in Music are the same as stops in speaking or writing being in like manner the proper terminations either of a part or of the whole of a composition  THE term  Subject  or  Fugue  or  Air  is in a musical sense what the word  Subject  likewise implies in writing The term  Air  in some cases includes the manner of handling or carrying on the subject  PASSAGES in Music are also like  Sentences  or  Paragraphs  in writing This last term hath sometimes been used to denote  Graces  or  extempore Flourishings  only But in this latter sense we shall never consider it the former definition being more  strictly just according to its original acceptation and therefore more applicable to the intention of this Essay  MUSIC is said to be in  Score  when all the parts are distinctly wrote and set under each other so as the eye at one view may take in all the various contrivances of the composer  CONTENTS  PART I  SECT I ON the Force and Effects of MUSIC Page  SECT II On the Analogies between

FORCE AND EFFECTS OF MUSIC  AS the public inclination for Music seems every day advancing it may not be amiss at this time to offer a few observations on that delightful art such observations I mean as may be chiefly applicable to the present times such as may tend to correct any errors that have arisen either in the composition or the practice of music  If we view this art in its foundations  we shall find that by the constitution o  man it is of mighty efficacy in working both on his imagination and his passions  The force of  harmony  or  melody  alone  is wonderful on the imagination  A ful  chord  struck or a beautiful succession of  single sounds  produced is no less ravishing to the ear than just symmetry or exquisite colours to the eye  The capacity of receiving pleasure from these musical sounds is in fact a peculiar and internal sense but of a much more refined nature than the external senses for in the pleasures arising from our internal sense of harmony there is no prior uneasiness necessary in order to our tasting them in their full perfection neither is the enjoyment of them attended either with languor or disgust It is their peculiar and essential property to divest the soul of every unquiet passion to pour in upon the mind a silent and serene joy beyond the power of words to express and to fix the heart in a  rational benevolent and happy tranquillity  But though this be the natural effect of  melody  or  harmony  on the imagination when simply considered yet when to these is added the force of  Musical Expression  the effect is greatly increased for then they assume the power of exciting all the most agreeable passions of the soul The force of sound in alarming the passions is prodigious Thus the noise of thunder the shouts of war the uproar of an enraged ocean strike us with terror so again there are certain sounds natural to joy others to grief or despondency others to tenderness and love and by hearing  these  we naturally sympathize with those who either  enjoy  or  suffer  Thus music either by imitating these various sounds in due subordination to the laws of  air  and  harmony  or by any other method of association bringing the objects of our passions before us especially when those objects are determined and made as it were visibly and  intimately present to the imagination by the help of words does naturally raise a variety of passions in the human breast similar to the sounds which are expressed and thus by the musician's art we are often carried into the fury of a battle or a tempest we are by turns elated with joy or sunk in pleasing sorrow rouzed to courage or quelled by grateful terrors melted into pity tenderness and love or transported to the regions of bliss in an extacy of divine praise  But beyond this I think we may venture to assert that it is the peculiar quality of Music to raise the  sociable and happy passions  and to  subdue  the  contrary ones  I know it has been generally believed and affirmed that its power extends alike to every affection of the mind But I would offer it to the consideration of the public whether this is not a general and fundamental error I would appeal to any man whether ever he found himself urged to acts of selfishness cruelty treachery revenge or malevolence by  the power of musical sounds or if he ever found jealousy suspicion or ingratitude engendered in his breast either from HARMONY or DISCORD I believe no instance of this nature can be alledged with truth It must be owned indeed that the force of music may urge the  passions  to an excess or it may fix them on false and improper objects and may thus be pernicious in its effects but still the passions which it raises though they may be  misled  or  excessive  are of the benevolent and social kind and in their intent at least are disinterested and noble  Lest the two passions abovementioned of  terror  and  grief  should be thought an exception to this rule it may not be improper to remark as to the first that the  terror  raised by  Musical Expression  is always of that grateful kind which arises from an impression of something terrible to the imagination but which is immediately dissipated by a subsequent conviction that the danger is entirely imaginary of the same kind is the terror raised in us when we stand near the edge of a precipice or in sight of a tempestuous ocean or are present at a tragical representation on the stage in all these cases as in that of musical expression the sense of our  security  mixes itself with the terrible impressions and melts them into a very sensible delight As to the second instance that of grief it will be sufficient to observe that as it always has something of the social kind for its foundation so it is often attended with a kind of sensation which may with truth be called  pleasing    As I take this to be the truth of the case so it seems to me no difficult matter to assign a sufficient reason for it we have already seen that it is the natural effect of air or harmony to throw the mind into a pleasurable state and when it hath obtained this state it will of course exert those powers and be susceptible of those passions which are the most natural and agreeable to it Now these are altogether of the benevolent species inasmuch as we know that the contrary affections such as anger revenge jealousy and hatred are always attended with anxiety and pain whereas all the various modifications of love whether human or divine are but so many kinds of immediate happiness From this view of things therefore it necessarily follows that every species of musical sound must tend to dispel the malevolent passions because they are  painful  and nourish  those which are benevolent because they are  pleasing  The most general and striking instance of the power of Music perhaps that we know of is that related of the  Arcadians  by POLYBIUS in the fourth book of his history which as it expressly coincides with the subject in question I shall venture to give the reader entire  This judicious historian speaking of the cruelties exercised upon the  Cynaethians  by the  Aetolians  and the little compassion that their neighbours had shewn them after having described the calamities of this people abhorred by all  Greece  adds the following remarks  "As the  Arcadians  are esteemed by the  Greeks  not only for the gentleness of their manners their beneficence and humanity towards strangers but also for their piety to the gods it may not be amiss to examine in few words with regard to the ferocity of the  Cynaethians  how it is possible being incontestable  Arcadians  from their origin  they are become so much distinguished by their cruelty and all manner of crimes from the other  Greeks  of this time I believe it can only be imputed to their having been the first and sole people of all the  Arcadians  who were estranged from the laudable institutions of their ancestors founded upon the natural wants of all those who inhabit  Arcadia  "The study of Music I mean that which is worthy the name has its utility everywhere but it is absolutely necessary among the  Arcadians  For we must not adopt the sentiment of  Ephorus  who in the beginning of his writings advances this proposition unworthy of him  that Music is introduced amongst men as a kind of inchantment only to deceive and mislead them  Neither should we imagine that it is without reason that the ancient people of  Crete  and  Lacedaemon  have preferred the use of soft Music in war to that of the trumpet or that the  Arcadians  in establishing their republic although in other respects extremely austere in their manner of living have shewn to Music so high a regard that they not only teach this art to their children but even compel their youth to a study of it to the age of thirty These facts are notoriously known It is also known that the  Arcadians  are almost the only people among whom their youth in obedience to the laws habituate themselves from their infancy to sing  hymns  and  paeans  as is usual among them to the honour of the gods and heroes of their country They are likewise taught the airs of  Philoxenus  and  Timotheus  after which every year during the feasts of  Bacchus  this youth are divided into two bands the one consisting of boys the other of their young men who to the music of flutes dance in their theatres with great emulation celebrating those games which take their names from each troop Even in their assemblies and  parties of pleasure the  Arcadians  divert themselves less in conversation or relating of stories than in singing by turns and inviting each other reciprocally to this exercise It is no disgrace with them to own their ignorance of other arts but they cannot deny their ability in singing because at all events they are necessitated to acquire this talent nor in confessing their skill can they exempt themselves from giving proofs of it as that would be deemed amongst them a particular infamy Besides this at the care and expence of the public their youth are trained in dancing and military exercises which they perform to the music of flutes and every year give proof of their abilities in the presence of their fellowcitizens  "Now it seems to me that the first legislators in forming such kind of establishments have not had any design of introducing luxury and effeminacy but that they have chiefly had  in view the way of living among the  Arcadians  which their manual and toilsome exercises rendered extremely laborious and severe and the austere manners of this people to which the coldness and severity of the air in almost every part of  Arcadia  did greatly contribute  "For it is natural to partake of the quality of this element Thence it is that different people in proportion to the distance which separates them differ from each other not only in their exterior form and colour but also in their customs and employments The legislators therefore willing to soften and temper this ferocity and ruggedness of the  Arcadians  made all those regulations which I have here mentioned and instituted besides these various assemblies and sacrifices as well for the men as for the women and also dances for their children of both sexes In a word they contrived all kinds of expedients to soften and asswage  by this culture of their man+ners the natural rudeness and barbari+ty of the  Arcadians  "But the  Cynaethians  who inhabit the most rude and savage parts of  Arcadia  having neglected all those helps of which on that account they had so much the more occasion and being on the contrary subject to mutual divisions and contests they are at length become so fierce and barbarous that there is not a city in  Greece  where such frequent and enormous crimes are committed as in that of  Cynaetha  "An instance of the unhappy state of this people and of the aversion of all the  Arcadians  to their form of government is the treatment that was shewn to their deputies which they sent to the  Lacedemonians  after the horrible massacre in  Cynaetha  In all the towns of  Arcadia  which these deputies entered immediate notice was given by an herald that they should instantly depart But the inhabitants of  Mantinea  after the departure of these envoys went so far as to purify themselves by expiatory sacrifices and to carry the victims round the city and its territories to purify both the one and the other  "We have related all these things first that other cities may be prevented from censuring in general the customs of the  Arcadians  or lest some of the people of  Arcadia  themselves upon false prejudices that the study of Music is permitted them only as a superficial amusement should be prevailed upon to neglect this part of their discipline in the second place to engage the  Cynaethians  if the gods should permit to humanize and soften their tempers by an application to the liberal arts and especially to Music For this is the only means by which they can ever be dispossessed of that ferocity which they have contracted  See  Dissertation où l'on fait voir que les merveilleux eff  attribuez à la musique des Anciens ne prouvent point qu'elle fut aussi parfaite que la nôtre Par M  BURETTE  Memoires de Literature tirez des registres de l' Academie Royale des Inscriptions Belles Lettres Tom septieme  whence the above fragment of POLYBIUS is translated  In the fifth seventh and eleventh vols of the  Holland  edition of this collection the reader will find several entertaining and curious tracts on the subject of Music  "  Still farther to confirm what is here advanced on the power of Music in raising the social and nobler passions only I wi  transcribe a passage from the celebrated  Baron de  MONTESQUIEU  This learned and sensible writer animadverting on the severe institutions of the Ancients in regard to manners having referred to several authorities among the  Greeks  on this head particularly to the relation of POLYBIUS above quoted proceeds thus  "In the  Greek  republics the magistrates were extremely embarrassed They would not have the citizens apply themselves to trade to agriculture or to the arts and yet they would not have them idle They found therefore employment for them  in gymnastic and military exercises and none else were allowed by their institution Hence the  Greeks  must be considered as a society of wrestlers and boxers Now these exercises having a natural tendency to render people hardy and fierce there was a necessity for tempering them with others that might soften their manners For this purpose Music which influences the mind by means of corporeal organs was extremely proper It is a kind of medium between the bodily exercises that render men fierce and hardy and speculative sciences that render them unsociable and sour It cannot be said that Music inspired virtue for this would be inconceivable but it prevented the effects of a savage institution and inabled the soul to have such a share in the education as it could never have had without the assistance of harmony  "Let us suppose among ourselves a society of men so passionately fond of  hunting as to make it their sole em+ployment these people would doubt+less contract a kind of rusticity and fierceness But if they happened to receive a taste for Music we should quickly perceive a sensible difference in their customs and manners In short  the exercises used by the  Greeks  excited only one kind of passions  viz  fierceness anger and cruelty But Music excites them all it is able to inspire the soul with a sense of pity lenity tenderness and love Our moral writers who declaim so vehemently against the stage sufficiently demonstrate the power of Music over the soul  "If the society abovementioned were to have no other Music than that of drums and the sound of the trumpet would it not be more difficult to accomplish this end than by the more melting tones of softer harmony The Antients were therefore in the right when under particular circumstances  they preferred one mode to another in regard to manners  "But some will ask why should Music be pitched upon preferable to any other entertainment It is because of all sensible pleasures there is none that less corrupts the soul  Spirit of Laws vol I p  "  The fact the baron speaks of seems to confirm what is here said on the power of Music for we see that Music was applied by the  Greeks  to awaken the nobler passions only such as pity lenity tenderness and love But should a state apply Music to give a roughness of manners or inspire the contrary passions of hardheartedness anger and cruelty it would certainly miss its aim notwithstanding that the baron seems to suppose the contrary For he hath not alledged any instance or any kind of proof in support of his supposition It is true as he observes in the second paragraph that the sound of drums or trumpets would have a different effect from the more  melting tones of softer harmony y  still the passions raised by these marti  founds are of the  social  kind they ma  excite courage and contempt of deat  but never hatred or cruelty  SECT II ON THE ANALOGIES BETWEEN MUS  AND PAINTING  FROM this short theory we shou  now proceed to offer a few observatio  relating to composition  But as musical composition is know to very few besides the professors an  composers of Music themselves and a  there are several resemblances or analo+gies between this art and that of  paint+ing  which is an art much more obviou  in its principles and therefore more ge+nerally known it may not be amiss t  draw out some of the most striking o  these analogies and by this means i  some degree at least give the common reader an idea of musical composition  The chief analogies or resemblances that I have observed between these two noble arts are as follow    st  They are both founded in geometry and have proportion for their sub  ect And though the undulations of air which are the immediate cause of sound be of so subtile a nature as to escape our examination yet the vibrations of musical  strings or chords  from whence these undulations proceed are as capable of mensuration as any of those visible ob  ects about which painting is conversant    dly  As the excellence of a picture  epends on three circumstances  design  olouring  and  expression  so in Music  he perfection of composition arises from  melody harmony  and  expression  Me  ody or air is the work of invention  nd therefore the foundation of the other  wo and directly analagous to  design  in  ainting Harmony gives beauty and  rength to the established melodies in  the same manner as colouring adds life to a just design And in both cases the expression arises from a combination of the other two and is no more than a strong and proper application of them to the intended subject  Melody  thus distinguished as the foundation of a musical composition and compared to  design  in Paint+ing hath been thought by some a vague and inde+terminate analogy because  harmony  rather than  lody  ought to be esteemed the highest excellence of every musical work yet though this be admitted it may still justly be said that  melody  is in realit  the  groundwork  as it is the  first principle  which  +gages the composer's attention  Thus to strike out a  musical subject  and to carry i  into  various melodies  may be compared to the  sketches  or  outlines  in a picture  this I conceive i  what the painters call design  and thence these  lead  principles  may be called the  foundation  of every finishe  piece in either of the arts  Therefore wherever I speak of harmony in th  course of this Essay I do not consider it as the fi  but most important circumstance which adorns an  supports the whole performance      dly  As the proper mixture of ligh  and shade called by the  Italians Chiar  Oscuro  has a noble effect in painting and is indeed essential to the compositio  of a good picture so the judicious mixture  of concords and discords is equally essential to a musical composition as shades are necessary to relieve the eye which is soon tired and disgusted with a level glare of light so discords are necessary to relieve the ear which is otherwise immediately satiated with a continued and unvaried strain of harmony We may add for the sake of those who are in any degree acquainted with the theory of Music that the  preparations  and  resolutions  of discords resemble the soft gradations from light to shade or from shade to light in Painting    thly  As in Painting there are three various degrees of distances established  viz  the  foreground  the  intermediate part  and the  offskip  so in Music there are three different parts strictly similar to these  viz  the bass or foreground the tenor or intermediate and the treble or offskip In consequence of this a musical composition without its bass is like a landscape without its foreground without its tenor it resembles  a landscape deprived of its intermediate part without its treble it is analagous to a landscape deprived of its distance or offskip We know how imperfect a picture is when deprived of any of these parts and hence we may form a judgement of those who determine on the excellence of any musical composition without seeing or hearing it in all its parts and understanding their relation to each other    thly  As in Painting especially in the nobler branches of it and particularly in historypainting there is a principal figure which is most remarkable and conspicuous and to which all the other figures are referred and subordinate so in the greater kinds of musical composition there is a principal or leading  subject  or succession of notes which ought to prevail and be heard through the whole composition and to which both the air and harmony of the other parts ought to be in like manner referred and subordinate    thly  So again as in painting a groupe of figures care is to be had that there be no deficiency in it but that a certain fulness or roundness be preserved such as  Titian  beautifully compared to a bunch of grapes so in the nobler kinds of musical composition there are several inferior subjects which depend on the principal and here the several subjects as in painting the figures do are as it were to  sustain  and  support  each other and it is certain that if any one of these be taken away from a skillful composition there will be found a deficiency highly disagreeable to an experienced ear Yet this does not hinder but there may be perfect composition in two three four or more parts in the same manner as a groupe may be perfect though consisting of a smaller or greater number of figures In both cases the painter or musician varies his disposition according to the number of parts or figures which he includes in his plan    thly  As in viewing a picture you ought to be removed to a certain distance called the point of sight at which all its parts are seen in their just proportions so in a concert there is a certain distance at which the sounds are melted into each other and the various parts strike the ear in their proper strength and symmetry To stand close by a bassoon or doublebass when you hear a concert is just as if you should plant your eye close to the foreground when you view a picture or as if in surveying a spacious edifice you should place yourself at the foot of a pillar that supports it  Lastly  The various  styles  in Paintingthe grandthe terriblethe gracefulthe tenderthe passionatethe joyoushave all their respective analogies in MusicAnd we may add in consequence of this that as the manner of handling differs in Painting according as the subject varies so in Music there are various instruments suited to the different kinds of musical compositions and particularly  adapted to and expressive of its several varieties Thus as the rough handling is proper for battles sieges and whatever is great or terrible and on the contrary the softer handling and more finished touches are expressive of love tenderness or beauty so in Music the trumpet horn or kettledrum are most properly employed on the first of these subjects the lute or harp on the last There is a short story in the TATLER  N  o    which illustrates this analogy very prettily Several eminent painters are there represented in picture as musicians with those instruments in their hands which most aptly represent their respective manner in Painting  PART II On MUSICAL COMPOSITION  SECT I ON THE TOO CLOSE ATTACHMENT TO AIR AND NEGLECT OF HARMONY  THESE observations being premised for the sake of those who are not particularly conversant in the theory of Music let us now proceed to consider this art with regard to its composition  We have already observed that there are properly speaking but three circumstances on which the worth of any musical composition can depend These are  melody harmony  and  expression  When these three are united in their full excellence the composition is then perfect if any of these are wanting or imperfect the composition is proportionably defective The chief endeavour therefore of the skillful composer must be  "to unite all these various sources of beauty in every  piece and never so far regard or idolize any one of them as to despise and omit the other two"  Several examples will hereafter be given of considerable masters who through an excessive fondness for one of these have sacrificed the rest and have thus fallen short of that perfection and variety which a correct ear demands  The first error we shall note is where the harmony and consequently the expression is neglected for the sake of air or rather an extravagant modulation  The present fashionable extreme of running all our music into one single part to the utter neglect of all true harmony is a defect much more essential than the neglect of modulation only inasmuch as harmony is the very cement of all musical composition  As in the work of harmony chiefly the various contrivances of a good composition are laid out and distinguished which with a full and perfect execution in all the parts produce those noble effects we  often find in grand performances so we may consider the improvement of  air  as the business of invention and taste  But if we may judge from the general turn of our modern Music I speak not of the  English  only this due regard as well to a natural succession of melodies as to their harmonious accompanyments seems generally neglected or forgotten Hence that deluge of unbounded  extravaganzi  which the unskillful call invention and which are merely calculated to shew an execution without either propriety or grace  In these vague and unmeaning pieces we often find the bewildered composer either struggling with the difficulties of an extraneous modulation or tiring the most consummate patience with a tedious repetition of some jejune thought imagining he can never do enough till he has run through every  key  that can be crowded into one  movement  till at length all his force being exhausted he drops into a dull  close  where his languid piece seems  rather to expire and yield its last than conclude with a spirited and welltimed  cadence  These kinds of compositions are greatly defective also in point of harmony and chiefly in the bass which is often impertinently airy or at best incapable of giving either spirit or fullness to the treble in both cases the composer not allotting to the bass the only part which it ought to bear in the whole construction  viz  the foundation of all the rest  A musical composition in this light may not unaptly be compared to the elevation of a building where it is easy to discern what are the proportions and ornaments suitable to each degree or ascent in the elevation and where the most common observer would laugh at seeing their order inverted and the heavy and plain  Tuscan  crushing down the light and delicate  Ionic  Thus they strive rather to surprize than please the hearer and as it is easier to discern what is excellent in the  performance  than  composition  of Music so we may account why many have been more industrious to improve and distinguish themselves in the  practice  than the  study  of this science  To this silly vanity we may attribute that strange attachment to certain unmeaning compositions which many of our fluent performers have professed their chief ambition being to discover a  swift  rather than a  judicious  or  graceful  hand That performers of this taste have so much in their power is at once the misfortune and disgrace of Music for whatever merit a composition may have in other respects yet if from a due regard to the construction of the harmony and fugues all the parts be put upon a level and by that means their supreme pride and pleasure of a  tedious solo  be not admitted it is with them a sufficient reason of condemning the whole  The generality of our musical virtuosi are too easily led by the opinions of such masters and where there is no real discernment  prejudice and affectation will soon assume the place of reason Thus through the inordinate vanity of a few leading performers a disproportionate fame hath been the lot of some very indifferent composers while others with real merit have been almost totally unknown  It may be worth considering from whence this false taste hath had its rise And  st  it may perhaps be affirmed with truth that the false taste or rather the total want of taste in those who hear and who always assume to themselves the privilege of  judging  hath often produced this low species of Music for it must be owned that this kind of composition is apt above all others at first hearing to strike an unskillful ear and hence the masters have often sacrificed their art to the gross judgement of an indelicate audience  But  dly  It hath often had its rise from the composer's bestowing his labour and attention on some trifling and  unfruitful subject which can never allow of an easy and natural harmony to support it For however pleasing it may seem in its air yet if it is not capable of admitting also a pleasing accompanyment it were much better laid aside than carried into execution On this account it is that many fugues are unsufferably tedious their barren subjects affording no variety in themselves are therefore often repeated entire or transposed or turned topseyturvey insomuch that little else is heard throughout the whole piece  I know it is a received opinion among the  connoisseurs  in Music that the best  subjects  for  fugues  or  airs  are pretty much exhausted and perhaps their observation may be right nevertheless the skillful composer will so artfully vary and conduct them that they will seem not only natural but also new  This may be seen by certain particular favourite passages that are to be found in almost all the compositions of our greatest masters  I would not be understood to mean here those slavish imitations of whole movements together especially of many of CORELLI's which shew their composers so destitute of all invention or contrivance as not to strike out one thought or device that can justly be called original      dly  Another source and perhaps the most general is that low idea of composition wherein the subject or air is no sooner led off than it is immediately deserted for the sake of some strange unexpected flights which have neither connection with each other nor the least tendency to any design whatever This kind of random work is admirably calculated for those who  compose  without  abilities  or  hear  without  discernment  and therefore we need not wonder that so large a share of the Music that hath of late appeared should fall under this denomination  How different from the conduct of these superficial adventurers in Music is that of the able and experienced composer who when he hath exerted his fancy on any favourite subject will reserve his sketch till at his leisure and when his judgement is free he can again and again correct diminish or enlarge his plan so that the whole may appear  though severly studied easy and natural as if it flowed from his first attempt  ut sibi quivis  Speret idem sudet multùm frustraque laboret  Ausus idem tantum series juncturaque pollet  Such fiction would I raise  As all might hope to imitate with ease  Yet while they strive the same success to gain  Should find their labour and their hopes are vain  Such grace can order and connection give  HOR  Art Poet  ver  FRANCIS    Many extempore thoughts thrown out in the fire and strength of imagination have stood this critical review and filled the happy author with uncommon transport It is then he gains fresh vigour and renews his toil to range and harmonize the various melodies of his piece  CORELLI employed the greatest part of his life in revising and correcting his works which the many grand and beautiful contrivances in his harmony may sufficiently evince    It may be proper now to mention by way of example on this head the most noted composers who have erred in the extreme of an unnatural modulation leaving those of still inferior genius to  that oblivion to which they are deservedly destined  Of the first and lowest class are VIVALDI TESSARINI ALBERTI and LOCCATELLI whose compositions being equally defective in various harmony and true invention are only a fit amusement for children nor indeed for these if ever they are intended to be led to a just taste in Music  Under the second class and rising above these last mentioned in dignity as they pay somewhat more of regard to the principles of harmony may be ranked several of our modern composers for the  Opera  Such are HASSE PORPORA TERRADELLAS and LAMPUGNIANI Though I must take the liberty to say that besides their too little regard to the principles of true harmony they are often defective in one sense even with regard to air I mean by an endless repetition of their  subject  by wearing it to rags and tiring the hearer's patience  Of the third and highest class of composers who have run into this extreme of modulation are VINCI BONONCINI ASTORGO and PERGOLESE The frequent Delicacy of whose airs is so striking that we almost forget the defect of harmony under which they often labour Their faults are lost amidst their excellencies and the critic of taste is almost tempted to blame his own severity in censuring compositions in which he finds charms so powerful and commanding  However for the sake of truth it must be added that this taste even in its most pardonable degree ought to be discouraged because it seems naturally to lead to the ruin of a noble art We need only compare the present with past ages and we shall see a like catastrophe in the art of painting  "For as an ingenious writer very justly remarks while the masters in this fine art confined the pencil to the genuine forms of grace and greatness and only superadded to these the temperate embellishments of  a chastised and modest colouring the art grew towards its perfection but no sooner was their attention turned from  truth simplicity  and  design  than their credit declined with their art and the experienced eye which contemplates the old pictures with admiration surveys the  modern  with indifference or contempt  Browne's  Essays on the Characteristics p  "  Painting was arrived at the summit of perfection when Music was far behind and but slowly advancing though greatly encouraged and admired The works of PALESTINA in that infantstate of Music may be considered as the first lights of harmony while those of RAPHAEL his contemporary and fellowcitizen not only excelled the several eminent masters that went before him but to this day remain unequalled Painting since that period hath undergone various changes and is now far short of the preeminence which perhaps it once had above its sisterarts In regard to Music  that  also from the time of PALESTINA to the present hath been subject to a series of alterations both in its stile and method of composition but if we except the interruption it hath found from a national bad taste in some parts of  Europe  it seems upon the whole rather to have gradually improved  SECT II ON THE TOO CLOSE ATTACHMENT TO HARMONY AND NEGLECT OF AIR  HAVING noted the reigning defect of the modern composers arising from their superficial use of modulation to the utter neglect of all true harmony the next thing that offers itself is the very reverse of this I mean the too severe attachment of the Ancients  By the Ancients are meant those who lived from the time of PALESTINA to the introduction of modern operas  to harmony and the neglect of modulation The old masters in general discover a great depth of knowledge in the construction of their harmony Their subjects are invented and carried on with wonderful art to which they often add a considerable energy and force of expression yet we must own that with regard to  air  or modulation they are often defective Our old cathedral music  is a sufficient proof of this here we generally find the more striking beauties of air or modulation give way to a dry rule of counterpoint many an elaborate piece by this means instead of being solemn becomes formal and while our thoughts by a  natural  and pleasing melody should be elevated to the proper objects of our devotion we are only struck with an idea of some  artificial  contrivances in the harmony  Thus the old Music was often contrived to discover the composer's  art  as the modern is generally calculated to display the performer's  dexterity  The learned  contrapuntist  may exercise his talent in many wonderful contrivances as in  fugues  and  canons  of various  subjects  and  parts  c But where the master is thus severely intent in shewing his art he may indeed amuse the  understanding  and amaze the  eye  but can never touch the  heart  or delight the  ear  I have often thought that the state of Music at different times might very  appositely be compared to the series of alterations in the art of building We cannot indeed with the same certainty and precision determine what may have been the perfection of Music in its original state among the Ancients yet the short analogy which follows may serve to evince that both these arts have varied according to the taste of particular ages  It is well known that in old  Greece  and  Rome  architecture was in its highest perfection and that after their several empires were overthrown these glorious monuments of their taste and genius were almost entirely destroyed To these succeeded a strange mixture of the  antique  and  barbarous  Gusto which has since been distinguished by the name of Gothic In these latter ages this art has gradually returned to its former state and the ancient relish of the grand the simple and convenient is revived  And thus we may distinguish the three great  aeras  of Music  Amongst the Ancients the true simplicity of  melody  with perhaps some mixture of plain unperplexed  harmony  seems to have been that  magic spell  which so powerfully inchanted every hearer  At the revival of this art in the time of Pope GREGORY a new system and new laws of harmony were invented and afterwards enlarged by GUIDO ARETINO but this served only to lead the plodding geniuses of those times and since their rigid followers to incumber the art with a  confusion of parts  which like the numerous and trifling ornaments in the  Gothic architecture  was productive of no other pleasure than that of wondering at the patience and minuteness of the artist and which like  that  too by men of taste hath long been exploded  In the reign of queen  Elizabeth  and  James  I the musicians were famous for composing les  ons  c  in forty parts See  Fasti Oxon  under the articles  Bird  and  Bull    At present our taste is greatly more diversified more subjected to the genius  and language of particular countries and less confined by those rigorous laws the least deviation from which was formerly thought an unpardonable offence as if those laws were intended to fix the boundaries of genius and prevent the advancement of science  But as we have said the art though still fluctuating has now gained much freedom and enlargement from these minute and severe laws and is returning nearer to its ancient simplicity The most eminent composers of late years have not shewn any great fondness for a multiplicity of parts which rather destroy than assist the force and efficacy of Music neither have they deprived the charms of  melody  of their peculiar province by stunning the ear with an  harmony  too intricate and multifarious And I believe upon a general survey of the particular genius of different masters we shall find that those who have the least of  nature  in their compositions have generally endeavoured to supply the  want of it by the severer application of  art  Yet I would by no means be thought to include all the old masters in this censure some of them have carried musical composition to that height of excellence that we need think it no disgrace to form our taste of  counterpoint  on the valuable plans they have left us Numbers of these indeed have fallen and deservedly into oblivion such I mean who had only the cold assistance of art and were destitute of genius But there are others of this class who although the early period in which they wrote naturally exposed them to the defect here noted yet the force of their genius and the wonderful construction of their fugues and harmony hath excited the admiration of all succeeding ages And here we shall find that the composers of this class will naturally fall into three different ranks in the same manner as those we have already ventured to characterize in the preceding section  Among these PALESTINA the first not only in point of time  PALESTINA lived at  Rome  in the time of LEO the Tenth the period at which all arts revived  but of genius too deserves the high title of  father of harmony  And the style of our great old master TALLIS  TALLIS was chapelmaster in  Henry  the Eighth's time  evidently shews he had studied the works of this great composer who lived to see his own system of harmony take root and flourish in many parts of  Europe  but more especially in  Italy  where he was immediately succeeded by several eminent masters among whom perhaps ALLEGRI may be esteemed the chief whose compositions with those of PALESTINA are still performed in the Pope's chapel and other choirs abroad in all these masters we see the same grand construction of parts and a parallel  defect  of  modulation  After these we may rank CARISSIMI STRADELLA  STRADELLA is supposed to have been one of the first composers who introduced the recitative into vocal compositions PURCEL not long after him aimed at something like that species of music not then known in  England  but whether he had any connection with the  Italian  is doubtful It is certain however this excellent master was possessed of all those qualities that are requisite to form a great composer and we may venture to say had the genius of PURCEL been assisted with such an intercourse as we have had since his time wi  h the best masters abroad he might have stood eminent perhaps among the greatest  In his airs there is a mixture of harmony and fancy that sets him far above the rest of his countrymen In fine what COWLEY and WALLER united may be esteemed among the poets such may PURCEL be thought among the musicians  and STEFFANI authors  of a much later date indeed and who lived also at different times yet their works though in general of the same character with those of PALESTINA are not perhaps of so high a class in one respect nor so low in another I mean that although their character is that of  excellence in harmony  and  defect in air  yet they are not so excellent in the former nor so defective in the latter as the venerable PALESTINA  From the time of these masters to the present there has been a succession of  many excellent composers who seeing the defects of those who preceded them in the too great neglect of  air  have adorned the noblest harmonies by a suitable  modulation  yet still so far retaining the style of the more ancient compositions as to make the  harmonic construction  the leading character of their works while the circumstance of modulation remains only as a  secondary  quality Such are the chaste and faultless CORELLI the bold and inventive SCARLATTI  DOMENICO SCARLATTI author of some excellent  lessons  for the  harpsichord  and son to the SCARLATTI here mentioned may justly be ranked among the great masters of this age The invention of his  subjects  or  airs  and the beautiful chain of  modulation  in all these  pieces  are peculiarly his own and though in many places the finest  passages  are greatly disguised with capricious  divisions  yet upon the whole they are original and masterly  the sublime CALDARA the graceful and spirited RAMEAU  We cannot form an adequate idea of the genius of this master from his  concertos  for the harpsich  rd alone though excellent in their kind but from his  chiefly which as yet I believe are but little known in  England  As in this species of composition the undertaking is great and extensive so the composer's skill or inability will in proportion be distinguished  Hence it is we are instantly charmed with the happy talent of RAMEAU His  choruses airs  and  duetts  are finely adapted to the various subjects they are intended to express In the first he i  noble and striking in the latter chearful easy and flowing and when he would sooth most expressively tender Besides among these are interspersed a variety of  dances  and other  instrumental pieces  which agreeably relieve the ear from too severe an attention to the  vocal  and therefore render these  operas  of RAMEAU more complete and entertaining than many others of character that may excel them only in some particular circumstance    To these we may justly add our illustrious HANDEL in whose manly style we often find the noblest harmonies and these enlivened with such a variety of modulation as could hardly have been expected from one who hath supplied the town with musical entertainments of every kind for thirty years together  The celebrated LULLI of  France  and the old SCARLATTI at  Rome  may be considered in the same light with HANDEL They were both voluminous composers and were not always equally happy in commanding their genius Yet upon the whole they have been of infinite service in the progress of Music and if we take away from their numerous works all that is indifferent there will still enough remain that is excellent to give them a distinguished rank  It is pretty remarkable that the three masters here mentioned have perhaps enjoyed the highest local reputation having all been the reigning favourites among the people in the several countries where they resided and thence have been regarded as standing models of perfection to many succeeding composers  The  Italians  seem particularly indebted to the variety and invention of SCARLATTI and  France  has produced a RAMEAU equal if not superior to LULLI The  English  as yet indeed have not been so successful but whether this may be owing to any inferiority in the original they have chose to imitate or to a want of genius in those that are his imitators in distinguishing perhaps not the most excellent of his works it is not necessary here to determine    These seem to be the principal authors worthy the attention of a musical enquirer who have regarded the  harmonic system  and the construction of fugues as the principal object of their care while at the same time they have regarded the circumstance of modulation so far as to deserve a very high degree of praise on this account though not the highest  SECT III ON MUSICAL EXPRESSION SO FAR AS IT RELATES TO THE COMPOSER  SO much concerning the two branches of music  air  and  harmony  let us now consider the third circumstance which is  expression  This as hath been already observed  "arises from a combination of the other two and is no other than a strong and proper application of them to the intended subject"  From this definition it will plainly appear that air and harmony are never to be deserted for the sake of expression because expression is founded on them And if we should attempt any thing in defiance of these it would cease to be  Musical Expression  Still less can the horrid dissonance of catcalls deserve this appellation though the expression or imitation be ever so strong and natural  And as dissonance and shocking sounds cannot be called Musical Expression  so neither do I think can mere imitation of several other things be entitled to this name which however among the generality of mankind hath often obtained it Thus the gradual rising or falling of the notes in a long succession is often used to denote ascent or descent broken intervals to denote an interrupted motion a number of quick divisions to describe swiftness or flying sounds resembling laughter to describe laughter with a number of other contrivances of a parallel kind which it is needless here to mention Now all these I should chuse to style imitation rather than expression because it seems to me that their tendency is rather to fix the hearer's attention on the similitude between the sounds and the things which they describe and thereby to excite a reflex act of the understanding than to affect the heart and raise the passions of the soul  Here then we see a defect or impropriety similar to those which have been above observed to arise from a too particular  attachment either to the  modulation  or  harmony  For as in the first case the master often attaches himself so strongly to the beauty of  air  or modulation as to neglect the  harmony  and in the second case pursues his harmony or fugues so as to destroy the beauty of modulation so in this third case for the sake of a forced and if I may so speak an unmeaning imitation he neglects both air and harmony on which alone true musical expression can be founded  This distinction seems more worthy our notice at present because some very eminent composers have attached themselves chiefly to the method here mentioned and seem to think they have exhausted all the depths of expression by a dextrous imitation of the meaning of a few particular words that occur in the hymns or songs which they set to music Thus were one of these gentlemen to express the following words of  Milton  Their songs  Divide  the night and  lift  our thoughts to heav'n  It is highly probable that upon the word  divide  he would run a  division  of half a dozen bars and on the subsequent part of the sentence he would not think he had done the poet justice or  risen  to that  height  of sublimity which he ought to express till he had climbed up to the very top of his instrument or at least as far as a human voice could follow him And this would pass with a great part of mankind for musical expression instead of that noble mixture of solemn airs and various harmony which  indeed  elevates our thoughts and gives that exquisite pleasure which none but true lovers of harmony can feel  Were it necessary I might easily prove upon general principles that what I now advance concerning musical imitation is strictly just both because Music as an imitative art has  very confined powers  and because when it is an ally to  poetry which it ought always to be when it exerts its mimetic faculty it obtains its end  by raising correspondent affections  in the soul with those which ought to result from the genius of the poem But this has been already shewn by a judicious writer  Vide three treatises of J H the second concerning poetry painting and music  with that precision and accuracy which distinguishes his writings To his excellent treatise I shall therefore refer my reader and content myself in this place with adding two or three practical observations by way of corollary to his theory    st  As  Music  passing to the mind through the organ of the ear can imitate only  by  Vide page in the above treatise  sounds and motions  it seems reasonable that when  sounds  only are the objects of imitation the composer ought to throw the mimetic part entirely amongst the accompanying  instruments  because it is probable that the imitation will be too powerful in the  voice  which ought to  be engaged in  expression  alone or in other words in raising correspondent affections with the part  I cannot bring a finer illustration of my meaning than from the old song in  Acis  and  Galatea  Hash ye pretty warbling Quire  Your thrilling strains  Awake my pains  And kindle soft desire  c  Here the great composer has very judiciously employed the vocal part in the nobler office of expressing with pathos the plaintive turn of the words while the symphony and accompanyment very chearfully imitate the singing of  the warbling quire  But had Mr HANDEL admitted this  imitation of ound  into the vocal part and made it imitate the  thrilling strains of the birds  by  warbling divisions  it is manifest the expression would have been much injured whereas according to his management of it the  imitation  greatly assists the expression  Indeed in some cases expression will coincide with imitation and may then be admitted universally as in such  chromatic strains  as are mimetic of the grief and anguish of the human voice  As to take Mr  H's  own example the chorus of Baal's Priests in Deborah  Doleful tidings how ye wound  But to the imitation of sounds in the  natural  or  inanimate  world  Such as the noise of animals the roar of thunder ocean  c  The murmur of streams    this I believe may be applied as a general rule    dly  When Music imitates  motions  the rythm and cast of the air will generally require that both the vocal and instrumental parts coincide in their imitation But then be it observed that the composer ought always to be more cautious and reserved when he applies this faculty of Music to  motion  than when he applies it to sound and the reason is obvious the intervals in Music are not so strictly similar to animate or inanimate motions as its tones are to animate or inanimate sounds Notes ascending or descending by large intervals are not so like the stalking of a Giant  Mr  H  has himself quoted a passage in  Acis  and  Galatea  "  See what ample strides he takes  "  as imitative of the  walk  of  Polypheme  but I apprehend the majesty of that air rather affected him by an  association of ideas  than any great similarity in the imitation  An association of this kind seems to have struck the author of the  Parallele des Italiens et des François en ce qui regarde la musique  "Pour la conformité says he de l'air avec le sens des paroles je n'ay jamais rien entendu en matiére de symphonies de comparable à celle qui fut exécutée à Rome à l'oratoire de S Jerôme de la charité le jour de la Saint Martin de l'année sur ces deux mots  mille saette mille fléches  c'etoit un air dont les notes etoient pointées à la maniére des gigues le caractére de cet air imprimoit si vivement dans l'ame l'idée de fleche et la force de cette idée seduisoit tellement l'imagination que chaque violon paroissoit être un arc tous les archets autant de fléches décochées dont les pointes sembloient darder la symphonie de toutes parts on ne sauroit entendre rien de plus ingenieux de plus heureusemeut exprimé"  We may learn from this how far  musical imitation  simply considered may amuse the fancy of many who are less susceptible of the more delicate and refined beauties of  expression  The particular felicity of the  Frenchman  in the musical performance here described seems to have depended on this similitude  viz  that every  violin  appeared as a  bow  and all the  bows  like so many  arrows shot off  the  points  of which seemed to  dart  the symphony through all its parts Perhaps so far as  imitation  was necessary his observation might be just But were this an argument that the business of  imitation  was superior to every other in musical composition it would reduce the noblest species of it still lower than the  extravaganzi  of the instrumental performances which we have noted in the chapter on modulation  as a flow of even notes  are to the murmuring of a stream  Here let me quote with pleasure the air which Mr HANDEL has adapted to those charming words of MILTON  Hide me from day's garish eye  While the bee with honied thigh  At her flow'ry work does sing  And the waters murmuring  With such concert as they keep  Entice the dewyfeather'd sleep  And let some strange mysterious dream  Wave at his wings in airy stream  Of lively portraiture display'd  Softly on my eyelids laid  Then as I wake sweet music breathe  Above about and underneath  Sent by some spirit to mortals good  Or th' unseen genius of the wood  Here the air and the symphony delightfully imitate the humming of the bees the murmuring of the waters and express the ideas of quiet and slumber but what above all demands this eulogium is the masterstroke of accompanying the voice with trebles and tenors only till he comes to these words  "Then as I wake sweet music breathe"  where  the bass begins  with an effect that can be felt only and not expressed  I have chosen to give all my illustrations on this matter from the works of Mr HANDEL because no one has exercised this talent more universally and because these instances must also be most universally understood  and little jiggish slurrs are less like the nod  of  Alexander  With ravish'd ears  The monarch hears  Assumes the god  Affects to nod  And seems to shake the spheres  In which air I am sorry to observe that the  affectation  of imitating this nod has reduced the music as much below the dignity of the words as  Alexander's  nod was beneath that of  Homer's Jupiter  than certain shakes and  trills are to the voice of the nightingale  Vide il Penseroso  Sweet bird that shuns the noise of folly  Most musical most melancholy      dly  As Music can only imitate motions and sounds and the  motions  only imperfectly it will follow that musical imitation ought never to be employed in representing objects of which motion or sound are not the principal constituents Thus to light or lightning we annex the property of celerity of motion yet it will not follow from thence that an extremely swift progression of notes will raise the idea of either one or the other because as we said the imitation must be in these cases very partial  What shall we say to excuse this same great composer who in his Oratorio of  Joshua  condescended to amuse the vulgar part of his audience by letting them  hear the sun stand still  Again it is one property of frost to make persons shake and tremble yet a tremulous  movement of semitones will never give the true idea of frost though perhaps they may of a trembling person    thly  As the aim of Music is to affect the passions in a pleasing manner and as it uses melody and harmony to obtain that end its imitation must never be employed on  ungraceful motions  or  disagreeable sounds  because in the one case it must injure the  melody  of the air and in the other the  harmony  of the accompanyment and in both cases must lose its intent of affecting the passions  pleasingly    thly  As imitation is only so far of use in Music as when it aids the expression as it is only analogous to poetic imitation  when poetry imitates  through mere natural media  H's  Treatises p  so it should only be employed in the same manner To make the sound echo to the sense in descriptive lyric and perhaps in the cooler parts of epic poetry is often a great beauty but should the tragic poet labour at shewing this art  in his most distressful speeches I suppose he would rather flatten than inspirit his drama in like manner the musical composer who catches at every particular  To give but one instance how many composers hath the single epithet WARELING misled from the true road of expression like an  ignis fatuus  and bemired them in a  pun  epithet or metaphor that the part affords him to shew his imitative power will never fail to hurt the true aim of his composition and will always prove the more deficient in proportion as his author is more pathetic or sublime  What then is the composer who would aim at true musical expression to perform I answer he is to blend such an happy mixture of air and harmony as will affect us most strongly with the passions or affections which the poet intends to raise and that on this account he is not principally to dwell on particular words in the way of imitation but to comprehend the poet's general drift or intention and on this to form his airs and harmony  either by imitation so far as imitation may be proper to this end or by any other means But this I must still add that if he attempts to raise the passions by imitation it must be such a temperate and chastised imitation as rather brings the object before the hearer than such a one as induces him to form a comparison between the object and the sound for in this last case his attention will be turned entirely on the composer's art which must effectually check the passion The power of Music is in this respect parallel to the power of Eloquence if it works at all it must work in a secret and unsuspected manner In either case a pompous display of art will destroy its own intentions on which account one of the best general rules perhaps that can be given for musical expression is that which gives rise to the pathetic in every other art  an unaffected strain of nature and simplicity  Whatever the state of music may have been among the ancient  Greeks  c or whether it was actually capable of producing those wonderful effects related of it we cannot absolutely determine seeing all the uses of their  enharmonic scale  are totally lost and of their musical characters which should have conveyed to us their art slender traces any where to be found From the structure of their instruments we cannot form any vast ideas of their powers  CALMET's Dissertation sur la Musique des Anciens  they seem to have been far inferior to those in use at present but which indeed being capable of as much execution as expression are only rendered more liable to be abused Thus the too great compass of our modern instruments tempting as well the composer as performer to exceed the natural bounds of harmony may be one reason why some authors have so warmly espoused the cause of the ancient Music and run down that of the modern  Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE's Works st vol fol p    I believe we may justly conclude that the force and beauties of the ancient Music did not consist so much in artful compositions or in any superiority of execution in the performance as in the pure simplicity of its melody which being performed in unisons by their vast choruses of voices and instruments no wonder the most prodigious effects were produced  BONET Histoire de la Musique  Since the time of GUIDO ARETINO  ARETINO lived in the eleventh century  the laws and principles of harmony have been considerably enlarged and by rendering this art more intricate and complex have deprived it of those plain though striking beauties which probably almost every hearer could distinguish and admire And I don't know whether this will not go some way towards determining the dispute concerning the superior excellency of ancient and modern Music It is to be observed that the Ancients when they speak of its marvellous effects generally consider it as an adjunct to poetry Now an art in its progress to its own absolute perfection may arrive at some intermediate point which is its point of perfection considered as an art joined to another art but not to its own when taken separately If the Ancients therefore carried melody to its highest perfection it is probable they pushed the musical art as far as it would go considered as an adjunct to poetry but harmony is the perfection of Music as a single science Hence then we may determine the specific difference between the ancient and modern compositions and consequently their excellency    There is no doubt but many rules may be deduced both from the compositions  of the best masters and from experience in observing the effects which various sounds have upon the imagination and affections And I don't know whether the same propriety in regard to the part of expression in  poetry  may not as well be applied to  musical expression  since there are discordant and harmonious inflections of musical sounds when united and various modes or keys besides the various instruments themselves which  like particular words or sentences in writing are very expressive of the different passions which are so powerfully excited by the numbers of poetry  "Soft is the strain when  Zepbyr  gently blows  "And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows  "But when loud surges lash the sounding shore  "The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar  "When  Ajax  strives some rock's vast weight to throw  "The line too labours and the words move slow  "Not so when swift  Camilla  scours the plain  "Flies o'er the unbending corn and skims along the main  "Hear how  Timotheus  vary'd lays surprize  "And bid alternate passions fall and rise  "While at each change the son of  Libyan Jove  "Now burns with glory and then melts with love  "Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow  "Now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow  "  Persians  and  Greeks  like turns of nature found  "And the world's victor stood subdu'd by sound  "The power of Music all our hearts allow  "And what  Timotheus  was is  Dryden  now"  ESSAY on CRITICISM  Perhaps the powers of passion and verse were never so happily exerted for the purpose of Music as in this ode and as happily hath the  genius  of the  composer  Alexander's Feast set to music by G F Handel  been united with  that  of the  poet    Thus the  sharp  or  flat key  slow or lively movements the  staccato  the  sostenute  or smoothdrawn bow the striking  diesis  Or  quarter tone  or less if performed by the voice or violin being an interval in the  enharmonic scale  of the Ancients and amazingly powerful in rousing the passions  This interval is equally capable in judicious hands of exciting terror grief despondency or the contrary passions in their extremes and the very wide difference in this case is chiefly produced from their different accompanyments and the particular modulations in which they are employed  all the variety of intervals from a semitone to a tenth  c  the various mixtures of harmonies the preparation of discords and their resolution into concords the sweet succession of melodies and several other circumstances besides these do all tend to give that variety of expression which elevates the soul to joy or courage melts it into tenderness or pity fixes it in a rational serenity or raises it to the raptures of devotion  When we consider the fulness of harmony and variety of air which may be included in the art of composing  fugues  we may pronounce this species of composition of all others the most noble  and diffusive and which like historypainting does not only contain the chief excellencies of all the other species but is likewise capable of admitting many other beauties of a superior nature But here in the term  fugue  I do not include alone those confined compositions which proceed by regular answers according to the stated laws of modulation but chiefly such as admit of a variety of subjects particularly for voices and instruments united and which with their  imitations reverses  and other relative passages are conducted throughout the whole in subordination to their  principal  and as the lesser beauties or decorations in poetry are subservient to the fable of a tragedy or heroic poem so are these different though kindred airs in the same movement in like manner subservient to some one principal design and productive of all the grandeur beauty and propriety that can be expected from the most extensive plan in the whole range of musical composition  By a diversity of harmonies the chain and progression of melodies is also finely supported and thence a greater variety of expression will be found in the construction of full Music In this case the composer hath the advantage of throwing his tender and delicate passages into the  solo  or those of a bolder expression into the  chorus  and as there are oftentimes a kind of  neutral  airs if I may so call them which by the performer's art may be made expressive of very different passions or as the same words by a change in their accent convey a different sense so this musical expression may be varied in such a manner that the same passage which has been heard alone if repeated may also be formed into  chorus  and  è contra  the  chorus  into  solo  In like manner may be disposed the  forte  and  piano  We may also here remark that in ranging different movements in the same  concerto  or in other suites of different airs the confined order of keeping in  the sequel of these to one or two  keys  at most produces but an irksome monotony of sounds for it is not sufficient that different movements are of different species their changes should also appear as well in their  keys  as in their  air  and the composer of taste will shew his art in the arrangement of these  different pieces  as well as in his variety of modulation or other contrivances in the  same piece  Such are the beautiful  cantatas  of BATTISTA PERGOLESE printed at  Naples  in the year They are perhaps the most elegant performances in this species of composition that have yet appeared  The  cantatas  of GIOVANNI BONONCINI published in  London  by subscription above thirty years ago are also very fine and may still be called modern though many performers who hear and see no farther than the most perishable part of a composition have given them up to an exploded taste nevertheless I shall venture to say that the  airs  of BONONCINI are natural and the  accompanied recitative  masterly and finely imagined in their progression to the  tempogiusto  or regular movement I don't know any method of accompanyment with the voice more delicate and affecting than this in which the  Italians  especially the two great masters here noted are peculiarly happy  PORPORA's  cantatas  deserve also a particular mention in this place The most agreeable changes in modulation from one movement to another may be found in many of these his masterpieces The  adagios  are generally indeed too much lengthened by which means they are rather tedious when repeated from the  Da Capo  and notwithstanding I have thought the subjects in them pleasing and have heard them very finely performed yet could I never be convinced that their author had learned the art of knowing when he had done enough    And as  discords  when judiciously managed give their succeeding  concords  a yet more pleasing harmony in like manner some happy contrivance in changing the key of separate movements whether from  flat  to  sharp  or  vice versa  will still in a higher degree afford relief and pleasure to the hearer many alterations of this kind may surely be affected without the least disagreeable surprize since we are not always delighted when the modulation follows as we naturally expect it nor always shocked when  that  expectation is disappointed  Thus by contrivances of this nature we are charmed with an agreeable variety  and which perhaps equally to the most striking  air  commands the admiration of many lovers of Music who yet can no otherwise account for the preference they may give to a fine composition than purely from the pleasure it affords them In fine it is this masterly taste and method of ranging in beautiful order the distinguished parts of a composition which gives the highest delight to those who can enter into the real merits of this arta circumstance the musical student would do well to consider before he engages in any trial of his talent that way But as example is of much greater force than any rule or precept whatever I would recommend to him a constant perusal of the best compositions in  score  where he will find all the information he can desire on this head  The musical student being here supposed to have some previous knowledge in the rudiments of harmony it might not be amiss before he attempts the more finished parts to take a particular survey of RAMEAU's  Principles of Composition  now translated into  English  for however prevailing a good ear may be found in the practice of composition yet the rules of this art as in all other arts are founded in nature and therefore must afford great assistance even to those who may think but slightly of them As the works of art without genius though masterly and studied in their construction are often defective of spirit and taste so are those of genius without art very far from perfection but when these are united when the powers of nature and the researches of art are fully exerted it is then only we may expect the noblest productions    After all that has been or can be said the energy and grace of  musical expression  is of too delicate a nature to be fixed by words it is a matter of taste rather than of reasoning and is therefore much better understood by example than by precept It is in the works of the great masters that we must look for the rules and full union of  air harmony  and  expression  Would modern composers condescend to repair to these fountains of knowledge the public ear would neither be offended nor misled by those shallow and unconnected compositions which have of late so much abounded especially those insipid efforts that are  daily made to set to Music that flood of nonsense which is let in upon us since the commencement of our summer entertainments and which in the manner they are conducted cannot possibly prove of any advantage to Music trifling essays in poetry must depress instead of raising the genius of the composer who vainly attempts instead of giving aid to sense Music's noble prerogative to harmonize nonsense and make dulness pleasing  Thus it fares with Music as it fares with her sister Poetry for it must be owned that the compositions last mentioned are generally upon a level with the words they are set to their fate too is generally the same these  insect  productions seldom outliving the  season  that gives them birth  It has been justly enough alledged  TOSI on the florid Song p  with regard to the  Italian  operas that there are also many improprieties in these which offend even the most common observer  particularly that egregious absurdity of repeating and finishing many songs with the first part when it often happens after the passions of anger and revenge have been sufficiently expressed that reconcilement and love are the subjects of the second and therefore should conclude the performance But as if it were unnatural to leave the mind in this tranquil state the performer or actor must relapse into all that tempest and fury with which he began and leave his hearers in the midst of it  I have just hinted this unaccountable conduct of the  Italian  composers by way of contrast to a conduct as remarkably ridiculous in our own I mean our manner of setting one single trifling air repeated to many verses and all of them perhaps expressive of very different sentiments or affections than which a greater absurdity cannot possibly be imagined in the construction of any musical composition whatsoever  What may farther be observed in the composition of these little airs is the general method of repeating the same thought in the  Ritornello  which is heard in the song By this means the burthen of the tune be it ever so common must incessantly jingle in the ear and produce nothing but some wretched alternations between the instrument and voice  On the contrary if the subject of the song was relieved by different passages in the instrumental part but of a similar air with the vocal this kind of variety might support the repetition of the whole with somewhat more spirit  Among the many excellent ballads which our language affords I shall mention that of  Blackey'd Susan  wrote by Mr GAY and propose it as a specimen to shew by what methods a composer might handle this genus of the lyric poem and which indeed is no other than to treat them as the  Italians  have generally managed those little lovestories which are the subject of their  serenatas  a kind of musical production extremely elegant and proper for this purpose Therefore I would recommend to our vocal composers some such method of setting to music the best  English  songs and which in like manner will admit of various  airs  and  duetts  with their  recitative  or musical narratives properly interspersed to relieve and embellish the whole  Thus one good ballad may supply a fruitful genius with a variety of incidents wherein he will have sufficient scope to display his imagination and to shew a judgement and contrivance in adapting his several airs to the different subjects of the poetry By this means not only a genteel and consistent performance might be produced but also fewer good masters would lavish their musical thoughts on subjects so far beneath them nor on this account would there be any dearth of those agreeable and familiar airs which might properly be calculated for those entertainments where  the public ear should be always consulted and of which I have so good an opinion that were this difference between a just or false taste but fairly submitted to its decision I should not dispute but the composition which was most natural and pleasing would bid fairest for the general approbation  Yet so long as our composers prosecute their studies without the least knowledge of any works but such as are on a level with their own they must never expect to advance in the esteem of their judges For as the striking beauties in a fine composition elevate and enliven the fancy so is it depressed and vitiated by too great a familiarity with whatever is mean and trifling  He therefore that is blessed with happy talents for this art let him shun all the means of catching the common air which so strangely infects and possesses too many composers but unless he has the virtue of the  bee  who  "With taste so subtly true  "From pois'nous herbs extracts the healing dew"  I fear he must banish himself from almost every place of public resort and fly perhaps to monasteries and cells where the genuine charms of harmony may often indeed be found for stores to grace his future productions  Our church music is equally capable of improvements from the same sources of taste and knowledge We seem at present almost to have forgot that devotion is the original and proper end of it Hence that illtimed levity of air in our modern anthems that foolish pride of execution in our voluntaries which disgusts every rational hearer and dissipates instead of heightening true devotion  If our organist is a lover of poetry without which we may dispute his love for Music or indeed if he has any welldirected passions at all he cannot but feel some elevation of mind when he hears the psalm preceding his voluntary pronounced  in an awful and pathetic strain it is then he must join  his  part and with some solemn air relieve with religious chearfulness the calm and welldisposed heart Yet if he feels not this divine energy in his own breast it will prove but a fruitless attempt to raise it in that of others nor can he hope to throw out those happy instantaneous thoughts which sometimes far exceed the bestconcerted compositions and which the enraptured performer would often gladly secure to his future use and pleasure did they not as fleetly escape as they arise He should also be extremely cautious of imitating common songs or airs in the subjects of this latter kind of performance otherwise he will but too much expose religion to contempt and ridicule  It may not derogate from our subject of churchmusic just to mention the present method of singing the common psalm tunes in the parochial service which are every where sung without the least regard to  time  or  measure  by  drawling out every note to an unlimited length It is evident that both the  common  and  proper tunes  were originally intended to be sung in the  allabreve  time or the regular pointing of two three or four  minims  in a  bar  a kind of movement which every ear with the least practice may easily attain nor when they are sung in parts should there be any more than three  i e  one treble tenor and bass as too complex an  harmony  would destroy their natural  air  And in this style our psalm tunes are capable of all the solemnity that can be required from such plain and unadorned harmony  The pious and ingenious Dr WATTS in his preface to his translation of the Psalms very justly laments this miserable drawling out the Psalm His remarks on this head so aptly coincide with the subject in question that I shall here transcribe them  "It were to be wished that all congregations and private families would sing as they do in foreign Protestantchurches without reading line by lineIt were to be wished also that we might not dwell so long upon every single note and produce the syllables to such a tiresome extent with a constant uniformity of time which disgraces the Music and puts the congregation quite out of breath whereas if the METHOD of SINGING were but reformed to a greater speed of pronunciation we might often enjoy the pleasure of a longer psalm with less expence of time and breath and our Psalmody would be more agreeable to that of the ancient churches more intelligible to others and more delightful to ourselves"    Whoever has heard the Protestant congregations abroad sing in parts their psalms or hymns may recollect with some pleasure that part of their religious worship and their exceeding us so far in a performance of this kind is chiefly owing to the exact  measure  in which those tunes are sung and not to their  harmony  for the greatest part of our own which were composed soon after the Reformation by those excellent masters we had at that time would doubtless be found as well in regard to their solemn  air  as  harmony  equal if not superior to any compositions of their kind And we may further observe that  air  is in a higher degree productive of both solemnity and chearfulness than  harmony  for there is a dignity and grace in the  former when invented by genius which a masterly harmony may indeed assist but can never produce  However trifling it may appear to consider this species of Music I cannot but own that I have been uncommonly affected with hearing some thousands of voices hymning the Deity in a style of harmony adapted to that awful occasion But sorry I am to observe that the chief performer in this kind of noble chorus is too often so fond of his own conceits that with his absurd graces and tedious and illconnected interludes he misleads or confounds his congregation instead of being the rational guide and director of the whole  It may be thought perhaps by thus depriving our organist of this public opportunity of shewing his dexterity both in his voluntary and psalm tune that all performers indiscriminately might be capable of doing the duty here required but it will be found no such easy matter to strike out the true sublimity of style  which is proper to be heard when the mind is in a devout state or when we would be greatly solemn to avoid the heavy and spiritless manner which instead of calmly relieving and lifting up the heart rather sinks it into a state of deprivation  We might soon arrive at a very different style and manner as well in our compositions as performance did we but study the works of the best chapelmasters abroad as CALDARA LOTTI GASPARINI and many others whose excellent compositions ought surely to be better known and rescued from the possession of those churlish virtuosi whose unsociable delight is to engross to themselves those performances which in justice to their authors as well as the world they ought freely to communicate  The  Motetts  of CALDARA are noble pathetic and finely adapted to the purposes here mentioned LOTTI and GASPARINI have also composed various pieces for the service of the church But as only the same of them hath as yet reached me I can only suppose them of a character equal at least to their other compositions the perusal of which have often afforded me a very singular pleasure  There is a composition for the church which the connoisseurs acquainted with its beauties esteem as inimitable in its way namely the  Stabat Mater  c of the Baron D'ASTORGA This nobleman had many excellencies as a composer and chiefly a simplicity of harmony and an affecting style in  many  of his  airs  and  duetts  which undoubtedly he has thrown in some peculiar manner into the performance here mentioned  If ever I have the felicity of seeing this work I shall expect to find it more equally conducted than the  Stabat Mater  of PERGOLESE For though it is the distinguished character of this latter composer to have succeeded in the  complaining or sorrowful style  yet I have often thought there was wanting in several movements of his  Stabat Mater  the just distinction which ought always to be observed between the tenderness or passion of a theatrical scene and the solemnity of devotion    We may clearly discern the effects of such a commerce as is here proposed with the works of the greatest masters The immortal works of CORELLI are in the hands of every one and accordingly we find that from him many of our best modern composers have generally deduced their elements of harmony Yet there remains something more to be done by our present professors they ought to be  as intimately conversant with those other great masters who since CORELLI's time have added both taste and invention and by uniting these have still come nearer to the perfection of the  generalharmonic composition  The numerous seminaries in  Italy  seldom fail of producing a succession of good masters from these we might select such pieces as would greatly contribute to the real solemnity of the cathedral service While others again of a different kind might be compiled and fitted for concertos or other musical purposes so that there would never be wanting a variety of examples and subjects for the practice of all students in harmony whatever and by an assiduous application to a greater and more comprehensive style than we have hitherto attempted we should soon be able to acquire so true a taste as would lay a sure foundation for the forming our own masters  The  Italians  are allowed to excel all other nations in the arts of Painting and Music but the reason is more obvious in the former than latter for the recourse to the  antique  which  Italy  afforded to painting must be the chief cause of its excellence in that art Music could have no such external assistance The Goths had rooted out all tracks of the ancient melody How then must we account for the superior genius which the  Italians  have since that time discovered in regard to Music Not from the chimerical hypothesis of air climate food  c  but from the public and national care which has ever attended it in that country so different from the treatment it meets with in  England    If it should be asked who are the proper persons to begin a reform in our churchmusic It may be answered the organists of cathedrals who are or ought to be our  Maestri di Capella  and by whom under the influence and protection of their deans much might be done to the advancement of their choirs nor would they find any difficulty in accomplishing this useful design as there are many precedents to direct them both from Dr ALDRIDGE and others who have introduced into their service the celebrated PALESTINA and CARISSIMI with great success And if this method when so little good Music was to be had hath been  found to advance the dignity and reputation of our cathedral service how much more may be expected at this time from the number and variety of those excellent compositions that have since appeared and which may be easily procured and adapted to the purposes here mentioned  An improvement of this kind might be still more easily set on foot were there any history of the lives and works of the best composers together with an account of their several  schools  and the  characteristic taste  and  manner  of eacha subject though yet untouched of such extensive use that we may reasonably hope it will be the employment of some future writer  Painting has long had an advantage of this kind but whether it has profited by such advantage may at present perhaps be disputed However I think if both these arts are not now in the state of perfection which one might wish it ought not to be attributed to the want of  genii but to the want of proper encouragement from able and generous patrons which would excite them to more laudable pursuits many professors in both the sciences having alike employed their talents in the lowest branches of their art and turned their views rather to  instant profit  than to  future fame  In reflecting on the state of Music in  England  I have often thought that it might not be altogether foreign to the design of some periodical memoir of literature to have an article sometimes giving an account and character of the best musical compositions  As a precedent I shall here take the liberty to consider a late performance in such a cursory manner as may perhaps be proper enough on the publication of other musical works hereafter  "  La Musique raisonée  c  par Mr le Compt St Germain  published by  Walsh  pr  l    s  This collection of airs in the opera style are most of them set for a  Soprano  some few for the  ConterAlto  and accompanied with violins  c  in four parts  "In these pieces the author has shewn a peculiar genius in the tender and complaining style but which require a performer like himself to do them justice this single species of musical expression seems to run through the whole collection for though he often aims to express different passions yet there is still wanting a sufficient variety to keep up the attention when more than one of these airs are performed at a time Nevertheless when they are intermixed with other performances in the concert they have then in a particular manner a very pleasing effect"  Some general idea like this of our musical essays on their first appearance would not only incite a spirit of emulation among the composers and render their works more worthy the public notice but might also prove a more effectual restraint to the publishers not to be so careless and dilatory on their part for however inadvertent our composers may be in putting their works incorrect out of their hands their printers are seldom behind them in that point    Thus and thus alone can we hope to reach any tolerable degree of excellence in the nobler kinds of musical composition The works of the greatest masters are the only schools where we may  see  and from whence we may  draw  perfection And here that I may do justice to what I think the most distinguished merit I shall mention as examples of true  musical expression  two great authors the one admirable in  vocal  the other in  instrumental  Music  The first of these is BENEDETTO MARCELLO whose inimitable freedom  depth and comprehensive style will ever remain the highest example to all composers for the church for the service of which he published at  Venice  near thirty years ago the first fifty psalms set to Music  This work is contained in eight volumes in folio The first four were published in the year And the whole came out complete two years after under the following title  Estro Poetico Armonico Parafrasi sopra Salmi Pocsia di  GIROLAMO ASCANIO GIUSTINIANI  Musica di  BENEDETTO MARCELLO  Patrizi Veniti Venezia  There are some pieces of instrumental Music published in  London  and said to be composed by BENEDETTO MARCELLO a  Venetian  nobleman but as these are very mean performances they cannot be supposed to come from the same great author  Here he has far excelled all the Moderns and given us the truest idea of that noble simplicity which probably was the grand characteristic of the ancient Music In this extensive and laborious undertaking like the divine subject he works upon he is generally either grand beautiful or pathetic and so perfectly free from every thing that is low and common that the judicious hearer is charmed with an endless variety of new  and pleasing modulation together with a design and expression so finely adapted that the sense and harmony do every where coincide In the last psalm which is the fiftyfirst in our version he seems to have collected all the powers of his vast genius that he might surpass the wonders he had done before  I do not mean to affirm that in this extensive work every recitative air or chorus is of equal excellence A continued elevation of this kind no author ever came up to Nay if we consider that variety which in all arts is necessary to keep alive attention we may perhaps affirm with truth that  inequality  makes a part of the character of excellence that something ought to be thrown into shades in order to make the lights more striking And in this respect MARCELLO is truly excellent if ever he seems to  fall  it is only to  rise  with more astonishing majesty and greatness  Far the greatest part  Of what some call neglect is study'd art  When  Virgil  seems to trifle in a line  'Tis like a warningpiece which gives the sign  To wake your fancy and prepare your sight  To reach the noble height of some unusual flight  ROSCOM  Ess on translated verse    To this illustrious example in  vocal  I shall add another the greatest in  instrumental Music  I mean the admirable GEMINIANI whose elegance and spirit of composition ought to have been much more our pattern and from whom the public taste might have received the highest improvement had we thought proper to lay hold of those opportunities which his long residence in this kingdom has given us  The public is greatly indebted to this gentleman not only for his many excellent compositions but for having as yet parted with none that are not extremely correct and fine There is such a genteelness and delicacy in the turn of his musical phrase if I may so call it and such a natural connection in his expressive and sweet modulation throughout all his works which are every where supported  with so perfect a harmony that we can never too often hear or too much admire them There are no impertinent digressions no tiresome unnecessary repetitions but from the beginning to the close of his movement all is natural and pleasing This it is properly to discourse in Music when our attention is kept up from one passage to another so as the ear and the mind may be equally delighted  From an academy formed under such a  genius  what a supreme excellence of  taste  might be expected  To shew on what foundation this improvement in the musical science may be rested I will take the liberty to add the following remarks from two unquestionable authorities on this head  The first is from my Lord SHAFTESBURY in his  letter concerning design  "I can myself remember the time when in respect of Music our reigning taste was in many degrees inferior to the  French  The long reign of luxury and pleasure under king  Charles  the Second and the foreign helps and studied advantages given to Music in a following reign could not raise our genius the least in this respect But when the spirit of the nation was grown more free though engaged at that time in the fiercest war and with the most doubtful success we no sooner began to turn ourselves towards Music and enquire what  Italy  in particular produced than in an instant we outstripped our neighbours the  French  entered into a genius far beyond theirs and raised ourselves an ear and judgement not inferior to the best now in the world"  And now to observe with what improper regard this art has since been treated we need only advert to the next remark from GEMINIANI's  Introduction to a good Taste in Music  "When I came first to  London  which was thirtyfour years ago I found Music in so thriving a state that I had all the reason imaginable to suppose the growth would be suitable to the excellency of the soil But I have lived to be most miserably disappointed for though it cannot be said that there was any want of encouragement that encouragement was ill bestowed The hand was more considered than the head the performance than the composition and hence it followed that instead of labouring to cultivate a taste which seemed to be all that was wanting the public was content to nourish insipidity"  This great master's first arrival amongst us seems to have been much about that time which the noble author abovementioned hath fixed for the most flourishing state of Music and his sentiments herein I dare say will appear reasonable and fair to every impartial judge of the subject before us especially as he hath done us the justice to assert that Music by proper culture and encouragement may be brought to as great perfection in  England  as in any other nation    PART III ON MUSICAL EXPRESSION AS IT RELATES TO THE PERFORMER  SECT I ON THE EXPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE OF MUSIC IN GENERAL  BUT as the nature and effects of  Musical Expression  do likewise relate to the  performer  and the different instruments  which are employed in the practice of Music so these in their turn may be also considered  For as  Musical Expression  in the  composer  is succeeding in the attempt to express some particular passion  The word  passion  is here taken in the most extensive sense as it may be applied to every species of excellence in musical compositions which from the very design of the composer demands an  energetic  execution  so in the  performer  it is to do a  composition  justice by playing it in a  taste  and  stile  so exactly  corresponding with the intention of the composer as to preserve and illustrate  all  the beauties of his work  Again as the  composer  is culpable who for the sake of some low and trifling  imitation  deserts the beauties of  expression  so that  performer  is still more culpable who is industrious to reduce a good instrument to the state of a bad one by endeavouring to make it subservient to a still more trifling  mimickry  Such are all imitations of  flageolets horns bagpipes  c on the violin a kind of low device calculated merely to amaze and which even with the common ear cannot long prevail over the natural love of harmony  The singing of a  cuckoo  and the cackling of a hen have in fact been often introduced into musical performances VIVALDI in his seasons or concertos so called has imitated the barking of a dog besides many other strange contrivances attempting even to describe as well as imitate the various changes of the elements  If those composers who take such pleasure in their musical imitations of the noise of animals will shew their ingenuity in that way I would advise them rather to follow the much more effectual method of introducing the creatures themselves And by way of example I shall give them the following story as it is related by Mr BAYLE in his Critical Dictionary under the article of LEWIS XI  "The Abbot DE BAIGNE a man of great wit had invented many things relating to musical instruments and being in the service of the king was once commanded by him to procure him harmonious sounds from the cries of hogs imagining the thing was absolutely impossible The Abbot was not in the least perplexed at such a command but asked the king money to perform it which was immediately delivered to him and he effected the most surprizing and remarkable thing that was ever heard He got together a large quantity of hogs all of different ages and put them into a tent or pavillion covered with velvet before which tent there was a wooden table all painted and he made an organical instrument with a certain number of stops so contrived that when he hit upon those stops it answered to some spikes which pricking the hogs that stood behind in a due order made them cry in such a harmonious manner that the king and all his attendants were highly delighted with it"    Even the use of double stops on this instrument may in my opinion be considered as one of the abuses of it since in the hands of the greatest masters they only deaden the tone spoil the expression and obstruct the execution In a  word they baffle the performer's art and bring down  one good  instrument to the state of  two indifferent ones  But surely it ought chiefly to be the composer's care not to give the performer any opportunities whatever of disparaging his art and the more he avoids all such low buffoonry the more will this false taste be discouraged for whatever may be alledged against the depravity of our taste in the musical science it certainly can be fixed no where so properly as on the masters themselves since were they to persist with any spirit or resolution in the exercise of their genius in such compositions only as are worthy of them they would undoubtedly improve the public ear and acquire to themselves a reputation and character worth preserving  There is one circumstance that might tend greatly to the repute and utility of Music which is that the professors themselves would cultivate a sincere and friendly commerce with each other and cherish that benevolent temper which their daily employ one should think ought naturally to inspire In truth there is nothing enlarges the mind to every social and laudable purpose so much as this delightful intercourse with harmony They who  not this divine effect are strangers to its noblest  ence for whatever pretensions they may otherwise have to a relish or knowledge of its laws without this criterion of the musical soul all other pretended signatures of genius we may look upon as counterfeit    Let every composer whether for the church the theatre or chamber thoroughly consider the nature and compass of the voices or instruments that are employed in his work and by that means he will the more easily avoid the common error of not sufficiently distinguishing what stile or manner is proper for execution and what for expression  He should also minutely observe the different qualities of the instruments themselves for as vocal Music requires one kind of expression and instrumental another so different instruments have also a different expression peculiar to them  Thus the  hautboy  will best express the  cantabile  or singing style and may be used in all movements whatever under  this denomination especially those movements which tend to the  gay  and  chearful  In compositions for the  German  flute is required the same method of proceeding by  conjoint degrees  or such other natural intervals as with the nature of its tone will best express the languishing or melancholy style With both these instruments the running into  extreme keys  the use of the  staccato  or distinct separation of notes and all irregular leaps or broken and uneven intervals must be avoided for which reason alone these instruments ought never to be employed in the  repieno parts  of concertos for violins but in such pieces only as are composed for them and these perhaps would be most agreeably introduced as principal instruments in some intervening movements in the concerto which might not only give a pleasing variety but shew their different expression to the greatest advantage  In continued compositions particularly for the  German  flute our composers have been not a little unsuccessful but whether  this failure may be imputed to the deficiency of the instrument or their attempting to exceed its natural expression may perhaps be worth the composer's while to consider  The  bassoon  should also have those gradual movements which naturally glide in their divisions and have the easiest transitions from one key to another and may be admitted as a  principal  in the  solo  or  rinforzo  in the  chorus  but never in the latter without a sufficient number of other basses to qualify and support it  See the sixth of GEMINIANI's Concertos    where there is one movement composed expressly for the bassoon the agreeable effect of which may be sufficient to evince how much better this method is of introducing windinstruments than admitting them throughout the concerto    The  trumpet  and  Frenchhorn  though equally limited in their  scale  yet have pieces of very different styles adapted to them The one perhaps to animate and inspire courage the other to enliven and chear the spirits yet are not both to be  alike discarded in the  figurate descant  or that part of composition where discords are concerned In this species of harmony I have known the Frenchhorn introduced with amazing success but it requires a very able composer to manage it properly with such accompanyments Either of these instruments when fully accompanied produce more wonderful effects than when heard alone because in all martial compositions their airs and expression are of so plain and unmixed a nature that their harmony is more easily comprehended and thence they strike the common ear with a greater degree of pleasure and admiration than any other instrument whatever  The  organ  and  harpsichord  though alike in so many respects that the same performer may equally shew his skill and execution on both yet are their respective compositions and manner of performance widely different the former expressing the grand or solemn stile the  latter those lively or trickling movements which thrill in the ear  Now where any of the above instruments overrule in concert whether in the chorus or solo or are appointed to play such airs or movements as they cannot easily express we may then conclude that the composer hath unfortunately set out upon a wrong principle which capital error will destroy every good effect that might have been found in his work had he duly considered the distinct limits and properties of each instrument  In classing the different instruments in concert we may consider them as the various stops which complete a good organ and as the skillful artist so contrives that when the full organ is heard no  mixtures  or  furnitures  c shall predominate but that the  diapasons  with their  octaves  Principals and flutes  may unite and fill the whole so we may rank the  violins  with their  basses  and  doublebasses  as the  diapasons  and  principals  of the concert for in fact they may be said to contain the very strength and spirit of all harmony and have in them not only the expression of all the other instruments but contain a prodigious variety of many other noble properties peculiar to themselves of which all the rest are utterly destitute It is their remarkable distinction that no concert can be formed without them as they unite and agree as well with every instrument as with each other and return every advantage they receive And as the finest  instrumental Music  may be considered as an imitation of the  vocal  so do these instruments with their expressive tone and the minutest changes they are capable of in the progression of melody shew their nearest approaches to the perfection of the human voice  Let the lover of Music call to mind the delightful effects they afford when joined with the organ to a chorus of good voices particularly in churches where the expansion is large and ample to soften  every rough and grating sound and unite the variety of voices and other instruments that complete this grand and solemn performance he will even in this ideal enjoyment of Music with pleasure own and prefer their harmonious expression  In fine it is in those productions only which include the violin and its species where an extensive genius may rove at large through all the various kinds of musical expression and may give the best performers though not in capricious and extravagant flights every desirable opportunity of shewing their skill  As a remarkable instance of the power of expression in a performance on this instrument I cannot omit the mention of three masters within my own knowledge KNERLER with great execution and a fine tone but unsusceptible of the powers of expression always disappointed the expecting ear CARBONEL with but a common portion of those qualities so requisite to enforce an expression by a natural and  instant feeling of the tender strokes in a fine composition never failed to give all the pleasure that could be expected from them But if we would hear these various qualities united in their full perfection we must repair to the admired GIARDINI The brilliancy and Fullness of his tone the sweetness spirit and variety of his expression his amazing rapidity of execution and exuberance of fancy joined with the most perfect ease and gracefulness in the performance concur to set him at the head of his  Since the appearance of this great performer the Signiors PLA PASSARINI and CHABRAN have also excited the admiration of the town yet  all it is but too general an observation and I cannot help repeating it that even the greatest performers when left to themselves cannot resist the vanity of amazing the multitude  For this reason the judicious hearer will always prefer their accompanyment in vocal performances where every kind of unmeaning execution must give way to a more natural harmony and their happier talents are employed in assisting the voice through  the various beauties of  true  musical expression  profession  Thus the judicious performer by this exertion of his  fort  or masterstyle may possibly give a pleasing tenderness or spirit even to an indifferent composition while on the other hand a neglect or ignorance of the use of this art however expert in other respects the performer may be will disguise if not intirely destroy those distinguished beauties which alone can raise the dignity and perfection of Music  I dare say the reader will anticipate the similar case I am about to mention in regard to  reading  as it will naturally occur to him on this head how commanding the power of expression may be found from a different manner of reading the same author especially in poetry where a just and spirited emphasis is so highly essential to point out those interesting strokes which are more peculiarly designed to delight the imagination and affect the heart But how infinitely short of this design is the bestwrote poem whether we hear it rehearsed with wild  and vehement accents or repeated in a cold and lifeless  monotone  In either of these cases our disgust or weariness of attention will be found in proportion to the beauties of the author so abused And just thus it fares with an injudicious performance of a fine musical composition  The different species of Music for the  church  the  theatre  or the  chamber  are or should be distinguished by their peculiar expression It may easily be perceived that it is not the  time  or  measure  so much as  manner  and  expression  which stamps the real character of the piece A wellwrought  allegro  or any other quick movement for the church cannot with propriety be adapted to theatrical purposes nor can the  adagio  of this latter kind strictly speaking be introduced into the former I have known several experiments of this nature attempted but never with success For the same pieces which may justly enough be thought very solemn in the theatre to an experienced  ear will be found too light and trivial when they are performed in the church and this I may venture to assert would be the case though we had never heard them but in some anthem or other divine performance and were therefore not subject to the prejudice which their being heard in an opera might occasion  "By the  ancients airs  were sung in three different manners for the theatre the style was lively and various for the chamber delicate and finished for the church moving and grave This difference to very many  moderns  is quite unknown  See TOSI on the florid song p  "    It is also by this efficacy of musical expression that a good ear doth ascertain the various terms which are generally made use of to direct the performer For instance the words  andante presto allegro  c are differently applied in the different kinds of Music abovementioned for the same terms which denote  lively  and  gay  in the opera or concert style may be understood in the practice  of churchmusic as  chearful  and  serene  or if the reader pleases less lively and gay wherefore the  allegro  c in this kind of composition should always be performed somewhat slower than is usual in concertos or operas  By this observation we may learn that these words do not always convey what they import in their strict sense but are to be considered as relative terms and if they cannot fully answer the composer's intention of communicating to every performer the nature of each particular style yet are they more proper than any other for that purpose however the composer will always be subject to a necessity of leaving great latitude to the performer who nevertheless may be greatly assisted therein by his perception of the powers of expression  In vocal Music he can never fail because if the different passions which the poet intends to raise are justly distinguished and expressed by the composer's art the sensible performer will feel this happy  union of both the arts and thence join his own to perfect the whole  With regard to the instrumental kind the  style  and  air  of the  movement  must chiefly determine the exact  time  and  menner  in which it ought to be performed and unless we strictly attend to this distinction the most excellent compositions may be greatly injured especially when the composer is not present either to lead or give the  air  of his piece  I might conclude this head with an observation or two on the several  graces  or ornaments of expression but as these are already enumerated and sufficiently explained in the rules of GEMINIANI I need only refer to that work However we may here remark that were these elements of playing in taste with their distinct characters and explanations become the general standard as well for the performance of masters as for the instruction of their pupils the former I believe would not only find them capable of heightening the very best compositions  but the latter would also with greater facility arrive at perfection But instead of this the generality of our masters following each their own method have preferred a more loose and florid manner of gracing by which the finest harmonies are too often destroyed and in their explanation of these graces by so many different marks and crowds of little notes impossible to be expressed have rather perplexed the learner who finding the same art so variously taught hath therefore been often discouraged in the progress of his study  And as we have distinguished this master as a pattern of excellence in his  compositions  so we must allow him to have been equally excellent in his  performance  for in this respect he was also peculiarly happy in his various expression as well of the  tender  the  serene  the  solemn  as of the  joyous  and  rapid  and with a ready and proper execution always entered into a true feeling of the spirit or softness suitable to each of these  styles  and notwithstanding the uncertain duration of this talent a circumstance common to every performer he will ever live in those rules above referred to and in his  Art of playing on the Violin  in which useful work he has communicated to the musical world as much of his superior taste and method of execution as could possibly be expected from such an undertaking  SECT II ON THE EXPRESSIVE PERFORMANCES OF MUSIC IN PARTS  HAVING said so much with regard to the expressive performance of Music in general I shall now conclude with a few hints which may be of service in the performance of full Music especially of such  concertos  as have pretty near an equal share of  air  and  expression  in all their parts  The first material circumstance which ought to be considered in the performance of this kind of composition is the number and quality of those instruments that may produce the best effect  And  st  I would propose exclusive of the four principal parts which must be always complete that the chorus of other instruments should not exceed the number following  viz  six  primo  and four  secondo repienos  four  repieno basses  and two  double basses  and a  harpsichord  A lesser number of instruments near the same proportion will also have a proper effect and may answer the composer's intention but more would probably destroy the just contrast which should always be kept up between the  chorus  and  solo  for in this case the effect of two or three single instruments would be lost and overpowered by the succession of too grand a  chorus  and to double the  primo  and  secondo concertino  or  violoncello  in the  solo  would be an impropriety in the conduct of our musical oeconomy too obvious  to require any thing to be said on that head It may be objected perhaps that the number of  basses  in the above calculation would be found too powerful for the  violins  but as the latter instruments are in their tone so clear sprightly and piercing and as they rather gain more force by this addition they will always be heard however if it were possible there should never be wanting a  double bass  especially in a performance of full concertos as they cannot be heard to any advantage without that NOBLE FOUNDATION of their harmony  As to windinstruments these are all so different in their tone and in their progressions through the various keys from those of the stringed kind besides the irremediable disagreement of their rising in their pitch while the others are probably falling that they should neither be continued too long in use nor employed but in such pieces as are expressly adapted to them so that in the general work of concertos for violins  c  they are almost always improper unless we admit of the  bassoon  which if performed by an expert hand in a soft and ready tone and only in those passages that are natural to it may then be of singular use and add fullness to the harmony  Did every performer know the  fort  of his instrument and where its best expression lay  there  to exert it most I should have but little pretence for my present attempt in the ensuing directions    dly  In the four principal parts there ought to be four performers of almost equal mastery as well in regard to  time  as  execution  for however easy it may seem to acquire the former yet nothing more shews a master than a steady performance throughout the whole movement and therefore chiefly necessary in the leading parts But this rule is generally neglected by placing one of the worst hands to the  tenor  which though a part of little execution yet requires so much meaning and expression that the  performer should not only give a fine tone the peculiar quality of that instrument but by swelling and singing of the notes and entering into the spirit of the composer know without destroying the  air  where to fill the  harmony  and by boldly pointing the subject keep it up with the greatest energy  As when we find a just and happy subserviency in all the under parts of a composition we conclude the composer to be a man of experience and good sense so also those only are the performers or discernment and good taste who can feel and with delight express those beauties undistinguished by the common ear  It is their part also to discern how little it avails to attempt any service in the performance where these attendants to the principal part are either superfluous in themselves or inharmonious in their effect and where they destroy instead of aiding the  mastersubject  or other appointed  airs  in the piece      dly  The same rule will serve for all the other instruments except the  harpsichord  and as this is only to be used in the  chorus  the performer will have little else to regard but the striking just chords keeping the time and being careful that no jangling sound or scattering of the  notes be continued after the pause or cadence During this interval of rest he should also attend with the utmost exactness the leading off again the remaining part of the movement that when all the parts are thus instantly struck his own may be found to pervade and fill the whole and if there are any rests succeeding the pause his attention to the leading instrument will direct him when these are to commence The same care is necessary at the return of each double strain when there are no intermediate notes to introduce the repeat In fine a profound silence must be always observed wherever the composer has intended a general respite or pause in his work I am the more particular in giving this caution to performers on the harpsichord as they are the most liable to transgress in this way because their instrument lying so commodious to their fingers is ever tempting them to run like wildfire over the keys and thus perpetually interrupt the performance As compositions of  this nature are not calculated for the sake of any one instrument but to give a grand effect by uniting many each performer ought therefore to consider his particular province and so far only to exert himself as may be consistent with the harmony and expression in his part Nor let any lover of Music be concerned if there is but little for him to execute since he will thence have some leisure for the pleasure of hearing for this reason the under parts in good compositions are more eligible to the performer who would rather enjoy the whole than be distinguished alone  The use of the  Acciaccatura  For an explanation  f the  Acciaccatura  see GEMINIANI's introduction to a good taste of Music printed at the head of his second collection of  Scots  songs  or sweeping of the chords and the dropping or sprinkling notes are indeed some of the peculiar beauties of this instrument But these graceful touches are only reserved for a masterly application in the  accompanyment of a fine voice or single instrument and therefore besides the difficulty of acquiring a competent skill in them they are not required in the performance of full Music  Under this article I shall beg leave to offer an observation on the harpsichord concerto a species of composition but of late invention and which if properly studied will admit of considerable improvements Hitherto we seem to have mistaken the property of this instrument by not considering what it can or cannot express Hence it is perhaps that our composers have run all their concertos into little else than tedious divisions and the subject or groundwork of these being introduced and repeated by a chorus of violins produce always a bad effect whereas the violin parts should be but few and contrived rather as accompanyments than symphonies by which means they may assist greatly in striking out some kind of expression  wherein the harpsichord  See RAMEAU's concertos for the harpsichord published by Mr WALSH  is remarkably deficient  Performers on the harpsichord in concertos for that instrument ought to take notice that  staccato divisions  on one note should be played with different fingers wherever it can be done with convenience and not with one finger only because in this case it is impossible to move the wrist which the quick repetition of one note with one finger would require with freedom enough to give these kind of passages their proper force    The same method perhaps may be equally proper in concertos for the organ which being frequently employed in other compositions and at present so generally approved it may not be amiss to consider it farther For however capable this instrument may be found to fill or soften all the rest it will nevertheless overpower and destroy them if the performer is not extremely cautious and tender in the use of it I would therefore propose that the accompanyments in the thoroughbass should never be struck in chords with the righthand as upon the harpsichord but  in all the full parts the leading subject should be singly touched and the performer proceed through the rest of the movement with the lefthand only For this reason no person whatever should attempt this instrument in concertos not expressly made for it but from the  score  and then if he has judgement and discretion sufficient he may enforce an expression and assist every part throughout the whole chorus Yet I cannot dismiss this article without once again observing that the difficulties of rendering the organ of that use in full concert which many expect from it are so various and intricate that we can never be too careful of the performer's abilities who if thoroughly skillful will so manage his instrument that it may always be heard but seldom distinguished    thly  As in all concertos overtures  c  where the  repieno  parts are more immediately necessary the composer ought to pursue some design in filling each chorus and relieving them with passages  either proper to be heard alone or so contrived as to give a good effect to the repeated  chorus  so in performing these different passages a different manner must be observed Thus when the  solo  is contrived for the sake of some peculiar expression it should then be performed in a manner suitable to the genius or character of the piece but always plain or however with such graces only as may heighten the expression without varying the time and which therefore require other qualities besides an execution to do them justice for this elegance of taste in the performance of the solo consists not in those agile motions or shiftings of the hand which strike with surprize the common ear but in the tender and delicate touches which to such indeed are least perceptible but to a fine ear productive of the highest delight Let not the performer then by an illjudged execution misapply this opportunity of shewing his skill in these remarkable places for though it is not the advantage  of instrumental compositions to be heightened in their expression by the help of words yet there is generally or ought to be some idea of sense or passion besides that of mere sound conveyed to the hearer  "La Poesia e la Musica gl'intendenti ben sanno son due arti gemelle e tra loro si analoghe che a pensare e favellar sanamente non vi dovrebbe esser Poesia senza Musica ne Musica senza Poesia"  G C  Becelli  on that account he should avoid all extravagant decorations since every attempt of this kind must utterly destroy whatever passion the composer may have designed to express And last of all let him consider that a more than usual attention is expected to his principal part when all the rest yield it this preference of being distinguished and heard alone  "It is supposed by many that a real good taste cannot possibly be acquired by any rules of art it being a peculiar gift of nature indulged only to those who have naturally a good ear and as most flatter themselves they have this perfection hence it happens that he who sings or plays thinks of nothing so much as to make continually some favourite passages or graces believing that by this means he shall be thought to be a good performer not perceiving that playing in good taste doth not consist of frequent passages but in expressing with strength and delicacy the intention of the composer  Introduction to a good taste in Music by GEMINIANI  "  These are the performers who execute all pieces with such a tasteless uniformity of manner that they seem not to distinguish either what is good or indifferent or even what is execrable      thly  In the chorus whether full in all the parts or leading by fugues the  violini di concertino  Principal parts  should be pointed with spirit to each  repieno  these also should be instantly struck without suffering the first note to slip by which means they always lose their designed effect an omission which many careless performers are guilty of either through miscounting of rests or depending upon others and thus render the whole performance ragged and unmeaning    thly  When concertos are performed with three or four instruments only it may not be amiss to play the solo parts  mezzo piano  and to know more accurately  where to find them the first and last note of every chorus should be distinguished thus  and to prevent all mistakes of pointing the  forte  at a wrong place that also ought to have the same mark by this means the performer will be directed to give the  first  note of every chorus and forte its proper emphasis and not suffer the  latter  to hand upon the ear which is extremely disagreeable  Above all to heighten this variety in the performance it is essential to mark the change of stiles that may often be found in the same movement and chiefly the  sostenute  and  staccato  for in these are contained the greatest powers of expression on the violin  Sounds continued or succeeding each other without interruption must be gently swelled and decreased and this without drawling or languor All cut sounds should be moderately struck yet clear and distinct that every shrill and sudden  jerk with the bow may be entirely avoided  Though few performers can feel the nice distinctions that lie between the beauties and errors in each of these stiles yet many are sensible of their very opposite effects and this circumstance alone will greatly assist those who would play either with tenderness or spirit    thly  As discords in Music are like shades in painting so is the  piano  like the fainter parts or figures in a picture both which do greatly assist in constituting and supporting an agreeable variety But as in the case of Music so much depends upon the taste and accuracy of the performer it is particularly necessary that a strict regard be had to the  piano  and  forte  for these in the hands of a skillful composer are generally so disposed as to afford a most pleasing relief and when justly executed give great beauty and spirit to a composition Yet how often do they pass unobserved or if at all expressed in so careless and negligent a manner  as to produce little if any sensible difference to the hearer It is a common practice with those lukewarm performers who imagine that diminishing the number of instruments will answer the same end as softening the whole to quit their part when they should rather be all attention how to manage it with the utmost delicacy transporting as it were like the swellorgan the lessening sounds to a vast distance and thence returning with redoubled strength and fullness to the  forte  and as this delightful effect can only be found from a performance of many instruments together we ought never to omit such opportunities of carrying this noble contrast to its highest perfection    thly  When the inner parts are intended as accompanyments only great care should be had to touch them in such a manner that they may never predominate but be always subservient to the principal performer who also should observe the same method whenever his part  becomes an accompanyment which generally happens in wellwrought fugues and other full pieces where the subject and air are almost equally distributed When the attention of every performer is thus employed by listening to the other parts without which he cannot do justice to his own it is then we may expect to hear the proper effect of the whole    thly  In every part throughout the full chorus all manner of graces or diminution of intervals or transposition of eight notes higher must be avoided which some indiscreet performers are but too apt to make use of merely from a desire of being distinguished and that the audience may admire their execution But these gentlemen ought to consider that by such liberties they do not only disappoint the expecting ear of a just performance of some favourite part but often introduce and occasion  disallowances  in the harmony From the same ruling passion we sometimes hear performers the moment a piece is ended run over their  instrument forgetting that order like silence under arms in the military discipline should also be observed in the discipline of Music  Lastly  To point out in all the parts of full Music their various subjects or fugues I have ventured to introduce a new musical character namely this mostra  or index but as the particular use I would apply it to may possibly be thought by some a groundless innovation it will therefore be necessary to say something in its defence and explanation  See six concertos published by JOHNSON where the use of this mark is applied as this character is easily made by the pen it may with very little trouble be added to the proper places either in manuscript or other printed concertos that require it    In all compositions for instruments in parts which are published in separate books and seldom perused in  score  most performers are frequently at a loss to know the composer's design hence proceed many discordant  ricercate  Extempore flourishings  where  only the full unmixed harmony should be heard Another consequence has been that for want of some such character as the mostra abovementioned the very best contrivances in a good composition have often passed undistinguished and neglected To remedy this defect it seems necessary to point out in each part every  leading  and  responsive  fugue for which purpose some particular mark should be placed over the first note of every  accidental  subject as well as  principal  the former being rather more necessary to be thus distinguished as every person capable of performing in concert must know the principal subject wherever it occurs and therefore will of course give  that  its proper expression  But the  accidental  subjects are on account of their variety much more difficult to be ascertained sometimes indeed they are a part or accompanyment of the  principal  and then may be styled a second or third subject as they are generally repeated or at least so retouched in  the progress of the fugue as to render them easily known But yet there are oftentimes other subjects very different from the principal and which being seldom or never repeated are therefore still more necessary to be marked for having always some peculiar relation to the other parts it is absolutely necessary that they should be justly expressed and this can only be done by a simple plain yet energetic execution for wherever a subject is proposed it can never with propriety admit of any variation Expression alone being sufficient to give us every thing that can be desired from harmony  Thus by a due observance of some such character as the  mostra  the performer will be greatly assisted to comprehend all the harmony and contrivances of the composer and obtain an advantage and pleasure almost equal to that of playing from the score  Though we may partly conjecture at the excellence of the  air  and  expression  of particular passages in a composition without a complete performance in all the parts yet of the  harmony  and relation these may bear to each other we cannot form a peremptory judgement and more especially as we are often deceived in our opinions of full Music from those faint and imperfect trials to which for want of proper hands they are frequently exposed where these are deficient whether in number or abilities I know not a more effectual test than a good harpsichord and performance from the  score  where the eye will assist the ear through all the defects of this instrument and give a better idea of the composer's design than any unsuccessful attempt in concert  For this reason were the printers of Music to publish the best  concertos  and  sonatas  in  score  as are those of CORELLI perhaps this very expedient though it may seem hazardous at first would contribute more to a general good taste and knowledge of Music than any yet thought of and the success that may reasonably be expected from so useful an undertaking will in the longrun amply reward them for all their trouble and expence  I have heard the first publisher of CORELLI's works in score very frankly acknowledge that the profits received from the sale of these books were greater than could have been expected and as the public has had almost twenty years trial of the advantages that have accrued from such an intimate acquaintance with this classical composer it cannot I think be doubted but a like good effect might also attend a publication in score of GEMINIANI's concertos and of other compositions in parts which may have deservedly gained a reputation    By what has been said it appears that this mark will be of similar use in Music  to that of  capitals italicks  and other orthographical illustrations in writing and therefore perhaps may make the chance which a musical author has for success more nearly equal to that of a literary one for it is certain that the former at present lies under so many additional disadvantages that whatever serves to lessen or remove any of them should be thought an invention of no trivial utility  For instance how often does the fate of a concerto depend on the random execution of a sett of performers who have never previously considered the work examined the connection of its parts or studied the intention of the whole  Was a dramatic author in such a situation as that the success of his play depended on a single recital and that too by persons thus unprepared I fancy he would scarce chuse to run the risk though he had even Mr GARRICK for one of his rehearsers Yet what the poet never did nor ever will venture the  harmonist is of necessity compelled to and that also frequently when he has not yet acquired a character to prejudice the audience in his favour or is in any situation to prevent their first censure from being determinate and final  A LETTER to the AUTHOR CONCERNING The Music of the ANCIENTS  SIR  THE Music of the Ancients and of the Moderns hath been often and fully discussed by the learned and I have only a slender and superficial knowledge of the theory either of the former or of the latter What is it then that I can offer you upon this subject In truth nothing better than a few straggling passages of  classic authors  relating to Music and a few slight remarks added to them  Horace Serm I iii says of  Tigellius  Si collibuisset ab ovo  Usque ad mala citaret Io Bacche modo summa  Voce modo hac resonat chordis quae quatuor ima  i e  He sang sometimes in the note of the upper string sometimes in that of the lowest string of the tetrachord  The  tetrachord  here is to be considered not as a particular instrument but as four strings bearing a certain musical proportion to each other of which in the  diatonic  scale the second was a  semitone  the third a  tone  and the last a  tone  and a  fourth  to the first as the  natural  notes B C D E The  first  and  fourth  in all tetrachords were fixed and immoveable  and one of them was called    summa  the  highest  the other    ima  the  lowest  The  highest  was that chord which gave the  deepest  or  gravest  sound the  lowest  that which gave the  acutest  sound and therefore what we call ASCENDING they called DESCENDING Thus for example if you compare the  open  strings of a violin to the tetrachord though their proportions are not the same the string which sounds G would have been with them the  highest  and that which sounds E would have been the  lowest  As in their tetrachord their  lowest  was a  fourth  to their  highest  the sense of  Horace  is that  Tigellius  sang the air  Io Bacche  and then would sing it over again what we call  a fourth higher Vox summa  is the bass and  vox ima  the treble  Apply this to the  Music of the spheres  The old  planetary system  may be considered as an  heptachord  an instrument with seven strings answering to the seven notes in Music The diameter of the orbit of each planet is the string  Saturn  who is the remotest and hath the longest chord and gives the deepest sound is the musical  or  highest  and he is so described by  Pliny  and so called by  Nicomachus  But in settling this  celestial harmony  the Ancients are by no means agreed which indeed is no wonder for  sense  is uniform and  nonsense  admits of endless variations  The concords of the Ancients were the  fourth fifth  and  eighth  The  third  major  or  minor  they held to be a  discord  and in  concert  they seem to have only admitted the  eighth  The ANCIENT  diatonic  system was a b c d e f g A b c d e f g  a  answering to the  natural  notes of the harpsichord with two  semitones  and five  tones  in an  octave  Of this system our  amila  or  alamire  was the  the  middle  or  center  Their  seven modes  or  tones  in the  diatonic  system seem to have been reducible in  reality  to  one mode  taken  higher  or  lower  or to have been  six transpositions  of  one natural original  and  fundamental mode  which you may call the  mode  of A and consequently as C  natural  is a  minor third  to  amila  so all these  modes  must have had a  minor third  Dacier  and  Sanadon  have published elaborate and useful commentaries upon  Horace  for which they deserve commendation but if it may be permitted to say the plain truth they too often made free with the property of others and were  compillagers poachers  and  smugglers  in the  republic of literature  As reputation is usually the only reward which the learned obtain for their labours it is the more fit that it should be impartially bestowed If this rule were observed some who ride in  Fame's chariot  would be obliged to trudge on foot or to get up behind it  Sanadon  and  Cerceau  in their observations on  Horace  Carm v  Sonante mixtum tibiis carmen lyra  Hac dorium illis barbarum  affirm that the  modus dorius  answered exactly to our  amila  with a  minor third  and the  modus phrygius  to our  amila  with a  major third  but surely this is a  musical error  and a  dream  from the  ivory gate  Two  modes  with the same  tonic  note the one neither  acuter  nor  graver  than the other make no part of the old system of  modes  Suppose the strings of an harpsichord are too low exactly by a whole tone Strike the keys a b c d e f g  Alamire  A and you will have the sounds of g a b  c d e  f g  The  nominal  keys and the  intervals  will remain the musical  powers  and  sounds  will be changed  Or else if the harpsichord is in tune in the  This reminds me to ask you a question whether there be in Music any rule and standard for a true pitch  usual pitch strike g a b  c d e  f g and call them a b c d e f g A  This seems to be the  mystery  of the Ancient  modes  they are all to be considered as a b c d e f g A  Or in other words they are all first a note second a tone third a semitone fourth a tone fifth a tone sixth a semitone seventh a tone eighth a tone  Or they are a note a second a minor third a fourth a fifth a minor sixth a minor seventh an eighth  But when the  mode  is changed the  sounds  are altered  lower  or  higher acuter  or  graver  In the  names  of the  seven modes  and in the  flats sharps  and  naturals  which  will correspond to them when they are reduced to our modern musical system the writers and commentators on Ancient Music are not agreed but still the system upon the whole the proportions and the intervals are the same  Now suppose two instruments of the Ancients sounding together and playing the same air one in one  mode  and one in another they must have sounded all along either  seconds  or  thirds  or  fourths  or  fifths  or  sixths  or  sevenths  But if the Ancients would admit none of these not even  fifths  in  concert  which the learned I think take to have been the case there remains nothing besides  unisons  and  octaves simple  or  double  for their  concerts  Seneca  thus describes a  concert  or  chorus  non vides quam multorum vocibus chorus constet unus tamen ex omnibus sonus redditur Aliqua illic acuta est aliqua gravis aliqua media Accedunt viris feminae interponuntur tibiae Singulorum illic latent voces omnium apparent  Epist And  Aelian  on  Timaeus  and the writer  De  Mundo  and in general all who have treated of this subject represent  and    harmony  and  symphony  as consisting in the mixture and union of sounds which are  and    acute  and  grave  In a  double octave  or  fifteen notes  the  vox media  is the  middle note  the  vox acuta  is an  eighth above  it in our way of counting and the  vox gravis  an  eighth below  it and so in this  chorus  all seem to have gone together in  unisons  and  octaves  From  Ptolemy  and his commentator  Wallis  it may be collected how according to their system the  seven modes  answer to our notes and also how they stood related to each other not according to the vicinity of notes and as B is next to A but as one mode produced another at the intervals of  fourths  or of  fifths  which seem to have been the passages by which the Ancients made transitions from mode to mode  So likewise in our modern system and in the  major tone  the key of C  natural  requires none but  natural  notes Go to the  fifth  of C and enter into the key of G and you must add one  sharp  Go to the  fifth  of G and enter into the key of D and you must add another  sharp  and so on Or if you proceed by  fourths  go to the  fourth  of C and enter into F and you must add one  flat  Go to the  fourth  of F and enter into B  flat  and you must add another  flat  c The same is to be done in the  minor tone  The  keys  may be considered as related to each other more or less according as their transposition makes more or less alteration in the system If you go from a  key  with a  major third  to the  sixth  of that  key  with a  minor third  no alteration is made in the descending  flats sharps  or  naturals  They seem therefore to be as near of kin as a  major  and a  minor  tone can be  I shall here mention some of the advantages which the modern  diatonic  system seems to have above the Ancient  By dividing every  tone  into  semi tones  we have a great variety of  transposed keys  or  modes  or  tones  By making use of the  major  and  minor third  we have  two  real and distinct  tones  a  major  and a  minor  which may be said to divide Music as nature seems to have intended into the  male  and the  female  The first hath strength the second hath softness and sweetness belongs to them both  Our  minor tone  is improved by borrowing from its  major tone  a  major sixth  and  seventh  to help its progress to the  eighth  Thus A with a  minor third  takes the  sharp  F and the  sharp  G from A with a  major third  when it ascends to its  octave  and quits them when it descends  By the aid of  semitones  we can mix the  chromatic  with the  diatonic  Music  The INTRODUCING a succession of  semitones  hath on proper occasions a beautiful effect as in  Handel's  incomparable  ombra chara  in his  Radamistus  an  opera  abounding with the happiest union and mixture of  art  and  invention  The DIVISION of  semitones  into  major  and  minor  and the  quarter notes  which belong to the  enharmonic  system are no inconsiderable part of  theoretical  Music The harpsichord takes no notice of them not being divided for that purpose but though in this and in some other respects it be defective it hath the advantage of being a very practicable and a most agreeable instrument and of accommodating itself well enough to the change of keys and to all keys that are not overloaded with  flats  or  sharps  especially when the defects are so judiciously distributed by the tuner as not to offend the ear grossly in any place which seems to be the best  temperature  of the  musical circle  I forgot to say a word or two concerning the origin and generation of the  diatonic  system  The old  tetrachord  was B C D E Add another to it of the same kind and with the same proportions E F G A  Join them B C D E F G A Add an octave at the bottom A B C D E F G A  As the first tetrachord had a  minor second  that  second  becomes a  minor third  when A is added below  What I have said upon this subject is I hope intelligible at least Some of the modern writers upon Ancient Music are deficient in point of perspicuity and seldom give the attentive reader instruction without giving him the headach along with it  The MODERN  musical language  or  character  as expressed by our  notation  is perhaps of all languages the most true and exact and liable to the fewest defects obscurities and ambiguities and if the time of  grave adagio largo  c could be equally ascertained nothing would be wanting to make it complete But that is a point which you have taken into consideration p  c  and to you I leave it  The TUNES which were played to  odes  like those of  Horace  must have been plain and simple because of the speedy return of the same stanza and because of the  quantity  of the syllables wh  ch was not to be violated or at least not greatly by the Music The modern musicians who have attempted to set such Latin or Greek  odes  to Music have often too much neglected this rule of suiting the  tune  to the  metre  and have made  long  syllables  short  and  short  syllables  long  and run  divisions  upon single ones and repeated some of the words  In modern  vocal Music  we regard not this law but perpetually sacrifice the  quantity  to the  modulation  which yet surely is a fault but the fault is partly if not principally in our language a language harsh and unmusical and full of  consonants  and of syllables  long  by  position  Thus in the ALEXIS of Dr  Pepusch  a very fine  cantata  you have  Charmingsoundsthatsweetlylanguish  c  These syllables according to the laws of  prosody  are all long except the sixth In the Music you have a  demiquaver  to the first syllable a  demiquaver  to the second a  quaver  to the third  c  and the singer is obliged to shorten long syllables as well as he can  To judge of our language in this respect you may compare an English  heroic  verse with a  supernumerary  foot to a Greek  iambic  Arms and the man I sing who urg'd by stubborn fate  Here are the same number of  feet  of  syllables  and of  vowels  or  diphthongs  in each but more than twice the number of  consonants  in the English verse  The tunes of  Anacreontic songs  must have been still more simple than those of  odes  Of noble race was Shinkin  The  hymns  which consist of a pretty long  strophe antistrophe  and  epodus  such as those of  Pindar  gave more scope to the musician and seem to have been susceptible of better  melody  and more variety and perhaps those  odes  and  hymns  and  choruses  where the metre is latent and less pleasing to our ears when we repeat them had more artful tunes adapted to them than the  Sapphic  and  Alcaic  odes which to us sound more agreeably  If we had the old musical notes which were set to any particular  ode  or  hymn  that is extant I should not despair of finding out the length of each note for the  quantity  of the syllables would probably be a tolerable guide and I would consent to truck the works of  Signior Alberti  for the tune that was set to  Pindar's    For as to  Vivaldi  give me leave to say that with all his caprices and puerilities he has a mixture of good things and could do well when he had a mind to it  As the  chorus  of Greek tragedies and the  dithyrambic odes  were often transcendently sublime and soared far above the regions of  common sense  up to those of  Fustian  and  Galimatias  if the imagination of the musician was as red hot as that of the poet there were perhaps old musical  extravaganzas  not inferior to those of any modern  There is one  ode  in  Horace  Carm III which runs in the measure of two  short  and two  long  Miserarum est neque amori dare ludum neque dulci  c  This falls into  triple time  and a sort of  saraband  might be made to it with two  quavers  followed by two  crotchets  in each  bar  The  air  was undoubtedly of that kind  The MUSIC then of the Ancients seems in general to have been more simple than ours and perhaps it would not have the same effect upon us as it had upon them if we could retrieve it We should  probably find in it something to commend and something to censure For many reasons it may be supposed to have been superior beyond all measure to the execrable Music of the modern Greeks the Turks Persians and Chinese which yet is charming in their ears and in their fond opinion would affect even things inanimate  With magic numbers and persuasive sound  Thus it is with Music bad seems good till you get acquainted with better  Yet one considerable advantage which arose even from the simplicity of the ancient tunes and which greatly set off their concert of vocal and instrumental music was that the singer could be understood and that the words had their effect as well as the music and then the charms of elegant and pathetic poesy aided and set off by the voice person manner and accent of the singer and by the sound of instruments might affect the hearer very strongly We must add to this the harmonious  and unrivalled sweetness of the  As the Latin tongue surpasses ours in sweetness so the Greek surpasses the Latin  "When I had taught my little boy his Greek nouns and verbs says  Tanaquil Faber  he told me one day a thing that surprized me for he had it not from me Methinks said he the sound of the Greek tongue is much more agreeable than that of the Latin You are in the right said I for in it you hear neither  strat  nor  crat  nor  quit  nor  brant  nor  trant  nor  mit  nor  put  nor  git  c which are the common sounds of Latin terminations By this I perceived that the boy had a good ear which I took as a presage that his taste and his judgement would one day be good having often observed that this is one of the earliest and best marks of a child's capacity"  Greek language  Virgil  Georg  II  cui non certaverit ulla  Aut tantum fluere aut totidem durare per annos  But in modern performances of this kind if you are not acquainted with the song it is often entirely lost to you nor can you always hear it distinctly even when you know it by heart or have it before you to read  As to  instrumental Music  the fashion seems to be to precipitate in all lively and brisk movements This indeed shews a  hand but the Music often suffers by it and a man may play as well as talk so fast that none can understand him I have heard such performers who had what is called  execution  lead off the  fugues  at such a rate that one half of their companions were thrown out and obliged to jump in again as well as they could from time to time Yet the  violino principale  chose rather to put up with a thousand  dissonances  than to abate of his speed a sure proof that if his hand was the hand of  Apollo  his ears were the ears of  Midas  and that he felt no part of the Music but his own  The SURPRISING powers of Music as related by several of the Ancients may justly pass for exaggerations When  Horace  tells us that a  wolf  fled from him who met him in the woods as he was chanting the praises of the fair  Lalagé  we conclude either that it is a poetical fib or that he sang so ill as to frighten the  savage  But surely Music deserves the  sober compliment  paid to it by the same  poet  when he calls it the  assuager of cares  Minuentur atrae  Carmine curae  It  Atque eam Musicen natura ipsa videtur ad tolerandos facilius labores velut muneri nobis dedisse

instrument I considered attentively a cat a dog a horse an ass a hind some cows some little birds and a cock and hens which were in the court below the window where we stood The cat paid no regard to the Music and to judge by his physiognomy he would have given all the symphonies in the world for one mouse he stretched himself out in the sun and went to sleep The horse stopped short before the window and as he was grazing he raised his head from time to time The dog sat him down upon his bum like a monkey fixing his eyes stedfastly on the musician and continued a long time in the same posture with the air and attitude of a  connoisseur  The ass took no notice at all of us munching his thistles very demurely The hind set up her large broad ears and seemed extremely attentive The cows gave us a look and then marched  off The little birds in a cage and in the trees strained their throats and sang with the utmost eagerness whilst the cock minded nothing but the hens and the hens busied themselves in scratching the dunghill"  Vigneul Marville  This author has related some strange stories concerning the effects of Music upon animals  Mêlanges  tom iii p    Imagine these  creatures  to be  human creatures  and you will have no bad representation of one of our  politest assemblies  at a  musical performance  Virgil  Aen vi  Nec non Threïcius longa cum veste Sacerdos  Obloquitur numeris septem discrimina vocum  Jamque eadem digitis jam pectine pulsat eburno  In these lines which I do not remember to have seen well explained  septem discrimina vocum  are  the seven notes of Music  or musical sounds in general  Numeri  are  airs  or  tunes  as in  Ecl  ix  numeros memini si verba tenerem  I remember the tune if I could recollect the words  Obloqui  is  to sing the same notes that the strings sound  Orpheus  therefore accompanies his lyre with his voice in his melodious airs singing and striking the chords now with his fingers now with the  plectrum  or  pecten  or  bow  or  quill  or what you please to call it  Plato  frequently declares that no innovations ought to be allowed in Music I am sorry for it since it gives reason to think that he and his contemporaries had poor and narrow notions of this art for by these rigid laws they effectually discouraged and excluded all improvements  In his treatise  De Legibus  VII  Ed Serr  he advises to train up children to use the right and the left hand indifferently In some things says he we can do it very well as when we use the lyre with the left hand and the stick with the right  It may be collected from this that the fingers of the left hand were occupied in some manner upon the strings else barely to hold a lyre shewed no very free use of the left hand and it appears from  Ptolemy  ii that they used bothhands  at once in playing upon the lyre and that the fingers of the left were employed not in stopping but in striking the strings  Plato  also observes that  practical  Music or the art of playing in tune and in concert is a conjectural skill grounded on long practice and habit but not capable of certainty and infallibility for arts says he consist in a great measure in experience and conjecture rather than in fixed rules  The POEM of  Catullus  called  Atys  seems to have been an imitation of those pieces which were sung by the  Galli  the castrated and mad priests of  Cybele  to a little  drum  or to a  tabor  and  pipe  two instruments constantly used by those rascals  The metre of this poem abounds with short syllables and expresses  precipitation  and  distraction  and the last syllable with the four short ones which go before it  Super alta vectus Atys celeri  rate maria  were probably accompanied with  five  thumps upon the drum  Claudian  about  A D  and  Vitruvius  long before him and other ancient writers speak of  hydraulic organs  which resembled our  organ  and had many pipes and many keys upon which the performer had an opportunity of shewing the agility of his fingers  Et qui magna levi detrudens murmura tactu  Innumeras  voces segetis modulatus aënae  Intonet  erranti  digito penitusque trabali  Vecte laborantes in carmina concitet undas  Claudian  Cons Mall Theod    The invention of the  hydraulic organ  is ascribed to  Ctesibius  an Alexandrian who flourished nineteen hundred years ago  Lucretius  who lived about an hundred years after him or somewhat more  seems  to mention the  organ  as an instrument of modern invention for though the word  organum  means any musical instrument and  organicus  any musician yet  Lucretius  means a  particular  instrument because he speaks of it as of a late improvement v  Quare etiam quaedam nunc artes expoliuntur  Nunc etiam augescunt nunc addita navigiis sunt  Multa modo organici melicos peperere sonores  Where  Creech  though a good editor gives us a very queer interpretation  nuper ab organicis musica reporta est  As if Music had been lately invented in the time of  Lucretius  It should be observed however that they who played upon lyres or  stringed  instruments are called  organici  by  Lucretius  ii  Musea mele per  chordas  organici quae  Mobilibus digitis expergefacta figurant  I dare not suppose that he means  the harpsicbord  and that such an instrument was then in use  In the year  Pepin  king of France received ambassadors from the emperor  Constantinus Copronymus  Constantine  who amongst other presents sent him an  organ  The historians of those times have made particular mention of this because it was the first organ  that ever was seen in France  Annal Nazar  c  Barthius  who had read all things good bad and indifferent and was an excellent  booklouse  hath collected in his notes upon  Claudian  some passages of ancient authors concerning the construction and the loudness of this instrument  It hath the voice of thunder  says one of them  and may be heard distinctly at the distance of a mile and more  Tertullian's  description of it though in his uncouth language deserves to be transcribed  SpectaOrganum Hydraulicumtot membra tot partes tot compagines tot itinera vocum tot compendia sonorum tot commercia modorum

that he compares the soul which animates the human body and acts in every part of it to the wind which fills the organ  Isaac Vossius  hath also some remarks upon the ancient organ in his book  De Poëmatum Cantu  which he wrote with a view to extol the Music of the Ancients and to depress that of all the moderns except his favourites the  Chinese  In this treatise as in most of his works there are some learned ingenious and useful observations mixed with others that are fantastical and extravagant  As the organs of the Ancients had many pipes and keys so their lyres or harps had many strings as fifteen twenty some say thirty and more If their lyre is represented in old monuments as having only four or five or seven strings that seems to have been done as  Vossius  observes partly to represent the lyre as it was originally and in its state of infancy  One would think that an ancient musician who was well acquainted with  concords  and  discords  who had an instrument of many strings or many keys to play upon and two hands and ten fingers to make use of would try experiments and would  fall into something like  counterpoint  and  composition in parts  In speculation nothing seems more probable and it seemed more than probable to our skilful musician Dr  Pepusch  when I once conversed with him upon the subject But in fact it doth not appear that the Ancients had this kind of composition or rather it appears that they had it not and it is certain that a man shall overlook discoveries which stand at his elbow and in a manner obtrude themselves upon him

company may perhaps shew some favour to the  Appendix  for the sake of the  Essay  Horace  Epist II ii grows very serious and says  Nimirum sapere est abjectis utile nugis  Et tempestivum pueris concedere ludum  Ac non verba sequi fidibus modulanda Latinis  Sed verae numerosque modosque ediscere vitae  That is  After all it is proper to leave these amusements to young people who may trifle

consonant to the dictates of reason  It is very true there is no  harmony  so charming as that of a wellordered life  moving  in  concert  with the sacred laws of virtue Human nature indeed cannot hope to arrive at this perfection the  instrument  will sometimes be  out of tune disallowances  also and  dissonances  will be sprinkled up and down but they ought  soon to give place to  concords  and to  regularity  till the whole be closed in a just and agreeable  cadence  and leave behind it a sweet and a lasting remembrance With this wholsome advice to all professors and to all lovers of Music not forgetting myself amongst the latter I close my epistle to which I would also set my name if that were necessary But your  Essay  to speak without a compliment stands not in need of my feeble aid and recommendation and the  name  of your humble servant which would be of so little use to you and is of so little consequence may as well slumber in silence and obscurity  I am c  POSTSCRIPT  AT the end of the Oxford edition of  Aratus  c there are some learned observations on the Ancient Music by  Chilmead  and a few fragments of ancient tunes to some Greek odes and hymns reduced to our modern  notation  It came into my mind that I had perused them long ago and upon looking now into the book I find two remarks of the editor agreeing with my own notions one that the  time  of the musical notes answered to the  quantity  of the syllables the other that the Music of the Ancients was very plain and unadorned  Probabilior eorum est opinio qui dicunt toni seu vocis

of  REMARKS On the Essay on Musical Expression  In a LETTER from Mr AVISON to his Friend in LONDON  "If any Man either from  MALICE  or for Ostentation of his owne  Knowledge  or for Ignorance do either  HUGGERMUGGER  or openly calumniate that which either he understandeth not or then maliciously wresteth to his own Sense he as Augustus said by one who had spoken evil of him  shall find that I have a Tongue also  and that  ME REMORSURUM PETIT  "  MORLEY's Introduction to MUSICKE  First published in M DCCLIII  A REPLY c  SIR  I THANK you for the expedition with which you transmitted to me the remarks on my essay I have in return sent you a short defence of myself against this virulent though I flatter myself not formidable antagonist  If after looking over these papers you should think that they may serve to rectify the judgements of such persons as this writer may probably have misled I desire you would send them to the press  I must confess from the advertisement of my remarker I apprehended some undue severity and notwithstanding he called himself a gentleman I had prepared myself for the worst My expectation has indeed been fully answered  instead of the gentleman the critic the candid musician his pamphlet has discovered him to be a vain disappointed snarling doctor  This were other reasons wanting may I think safely be concluded from the pains he takes to make his readers understand that D stands for Doctor See his Catalogue of  Antient English Musicians  Rem p  of the science  He begins I think with a pretty highflown compliment upon the style of my Essay and says that it is writ in a language not unworthy of our best prosewriters nay he adds also that the person who drew up the Preface to my Concertos must be capable of giving sensible thoughts on other branches of Music  The writer of the  Remarks  is supposed to have alluded to the late Mr Avison's ingenious friend Dr Brown author of the  Essays on Ld Shaftsbury's Characteristics  The foregoing  Letter concerning the Music of the Ancients  was written by the learned Dr Jortin  But why all this panegyric only to introduce this very candid insinuation that I am but the  nominal author  of both one and the other  To reply to the man himself or to offer to clear myself of this ridiculous  charge I think very much beneath me But I will observe to  you  that when I had determined to publish some thoughts on the subject of Music by way of Preface to my last Concertos I found my first design of writing directions to performers only grew so much upon my hands that I could not resist the temptation however unequal to the task or extending them also to the practice of composition Having thus attempted a province of writing which was new to me I thought I could not engage in it with too much caution and therefore had recourse to my learned friends by whose advice I was induced to separate that part which related to the performance of full Music and to publish the whole together afterwards under the title of  An Essay on Musical Expression  and am proud to embrace this opportunity of acknowledging the generous countenance which those gentlemen of integrity and genius shewed it  So far  our critic has wisely conjectured it was the work of a  Junto  But to speak of the Essay itself The plan it was formed upon was of a singular kind It had nothing to do with the theoretic principles and the mere mechanism of the science Its aim was widely different Intended indeed as a critical but yet as a liberal examen of this pleasing art according to rules not drawn from the formal schools of systematical professors but from the school of nature and good sense  You will easily perceive that to the execution of such a plan nothing was necessary but a good ear and a taste cultivated by frequent hearing of Music It was only writing on harmony as many men who never handled a pencil have written upon colouring and as many who never penned a stanza have written upon metre  The ABBÉ DU BOS whom the remarker has deigned to quote on a matter that required some taste in Music was unfortunately of this species of writers Hear his character from VOLTAIRE's  Siecle de Louis  XIV  "Tous les Artistes lisent avec fruit ses Reflexions sur la Poesie la Peinture et la Musique  Il ne savoit  pourtant  pas la Musique  il n'avoit jamais pu faire de vers et n'avoit pas un Tableau  Mais il avoit beaucoup lu vu entendu reflechi  "  and yet in every age  writers of this class may be found whose works are held in as high esteem as if they had been composed by the most able practical professors  To give an instance or two if our critic will pardon the learning of it there is not nor perhaps ever was a single verse extant from the pen of LONGINUS and yet his critical taste is as universally allowed as that of HORACE himself Though ARISTOTLE may justly be styled the father of criticism and true judgement in poetry yet he certainly did not excel in greatness or beauty of imagination and had but a small share of the poetical spirit  If then the genius of this sort of criticism is universally such that having taste not practice for its object it is directed to  improve  the  manner  not  teach  the  mechanism  of any science I see no reason why a critical enquirer into the merits of my essay should think it  his business first to examine the merits of my musical compositions Admitting those compositions to be as bad as our Doctor would make them I am then but in the case of those writers whom Mr  Pope  somewhere mentions  "Rules for good verse they first with pains recite  "Then shew us what is bad by what they write"  But Mr  Pope  has said in another place  "Let such teach others who themselves excel  "And censure freely who have written well"  This our sage remarker looked upon as an universal axiom that would serve his purpose excellently and accordingly planted it in his titlepage supposing that the poet thought none had a right to criticise but such as were acknowledged to be good writers whereas he meant by it only that criticism from an allowed artist came with additional force and lustre and so undoubtedly it does Yet  to do my author justice he presently runs from his text himself for in the very th page he is of opinion that a person would be best qualified to write upon this subject who had not only  not written well  but who had not  written at all  provided only that this person was a man of fortune like his friend Sir  Humphrey Dash  If you ask the reason he will tell you  "that to be sure Sir Humphrey's large estate would give a sanction and perhaps command a deference to his opinion"  A very gentlemanly reflection truly  But why must this rich Sir  Humphrey  be the only licensed critic And why must a professor  though even of the bighest rank  not be admitted No he will reply by no means  "because in some respect or other the world will think him interested in it and will very easily be persuaded that whatever degree of esteem his  works  or  abilities  may stand in their opinion yet that in his own they are placed much higher"  Thus it is evident that his sole objection lay against the author of the essay and not the essay itself and had I not set my name to it it is more than probable the public would not have been favoured with his curious remarks and for this reason chiefly he has been instigated to level all his spleen against my character as a composer nor has he thought it sufficient to  vilify  the work he has  given me  but he must  rob  me of  that  which he could not hope to  vilify  An unparalleled favour indeed and no doubt personally intended  There is a malevolence among some professors of the harmonic art from which no distance of time or country can secure even the most deserving in their own profession Their contemporaries they treat as rivals to their interest and the works and cha+racters of those that are gone before they consider as obstructions to their fame  We cannot otherwise account for that wilful ignorance or affectation in some masters who have been weak or rather envious enough to propagate a ridiculous notion that CORELLI was indebted to another composer for the setting of his basses Can any thing be imagined so absurd as this supposition For the nature and method of musical composition is well known to be such that whoever this extraordinary coadjutor of CORELLI may have been these shallow defamers might have spread their falsities much more consistently had they attributed the construction of the whole to this wondrous unknown    I think I have already reduced my antagonist's method of proceeding to its first principles  viz  to personal pique and resentment and have shewn that had he succeeded in his malevolent attempthad he proved my compositions as execrable as  some  that have echoed through university theatres had he done even this it would scarce have affected the character of my essay  I will now endeavour to shew that the compositions themselves are not quite so blameable as this musical Drawcansir would make them  His first critique and I think his masterpiece contains many circumstantial but false and virulent remarks on the first  allegro  of these concertos to which he supposes I would give the name of  fugue  Be it just what he pleases to call it I shall not defend what the public is  already in possession of the public being the most proper judge I shall only here observe that our critic has wilfully or ignorantly confounded the terms  fugue  and  imitation  which latter is by no means subject to the same laws with the former  There are many irregular subjects which may often be introduced into musical compositions and when any of these are  imitated  or  reversed  a good ear will ascertain their  proper answers  beyond any rules whatever for the principles of harmony which particularly direct the method of answering a complete and regular subject would carry the answers of many others of a subordinate kind into an extraneous modulation Therefore such subjects ought only to be imitated and the distances in this case are no otherwise to be considered than as they may best agree with the  mode  or  key  in which they are employed or that which is next to follow neither is it necessary that their  intervals  should be confined to  any  stated progression  or  order  in their  melody  HAD I observed the method of answering the  accidental subjects  in this  allegro  as laid down by our critic in his remarks they must have produced most shocking effects which though this mechanic in Music would perhaps have approved yet better judges might in reality have imagined I had known no other art than that of the  spruzzarino  See Remarks p    Before I leave this part of my subject I shall quote two authorities the first of which I make no doubt our critic will acknowledge as authentic since it comes from the same noble author whose  Treatise on Harmony  he has himself in his postscript so particularly recommended to my perusal  The second I shall venture to produce without the advantage of so considerable a sanction though in the opinion of unprejudiced men one of those happy spirits whose parts and application will be  esteemed in afterages an honour not only to his country but to the present  aera  of that art the progress of which he has so nobly assisted  Lord ABERCORN in his  Treatise on Harmony  after several judicious remarks on the use of  solmisation  in assisting the young composer how to ascertain the proper answers to any  regular fugue  hath the following reflections on the species of  composition  which is called  imitation  "There are many other kinds of  composition  which are often called  fugues  though they are properly no more than  imitations  of  fugues  for their  several parts  don't strictly proceed by the  same species of intervals  It would be endless to enumerate all the varieties of these  imitations  which have been invented by the curious wherefore we shall only take notice of  two  sorts of them the  first  of which is simply called  imitation  and the  other  is called  fuga in nomine  "A simple  imitation  appears to the eye like a  fugue  its parts seeming to proceed in the  same manner  if we only consider the  lines  and  spaces  on which they are written In  these  the  answer  may be made to follow the guide  in any interval  as of a d d th th th th  c  But as in  all  these cases the several  parts  do not strictly proceed by the  same intervals  the  semitones  being placed differently in  one part  from what they are in  another  they are not properly to be called  fugues  but  imitations  only  Lord  Abercorn's  Treatise on Harmony p  "  The other authority I shall bring from Mr RAMEAU's  Principles of Composition  on the subject of design imitation  c  in Music  "Design in Music is in general the subject of all that the composer proposes for a skilful composer is to propose to himself a movement a key or mode a melody and an harmony agreeable to the subject he would treat  But this term is to be more particularly adapted to a certain melody which he would have predominant in the continuance of a piece either for making it suitable and agreeable to the sense of the words or for fancy or taste and in that case it is distinguished in design in imitation and in fugue  "Imitation hath no particular merit that deserves our attention it consisting only by repeating at pleasure and in any of the parts a certain continuance of melody  without any other regularity  "Fugue as well as imitation consists in a certain continuance of melody which may be repeated at pleasure and in any of the parts  but with more circumspection  according to the following rules  "If in imitation we may repeat the melody of one or more bars and even the air entirely in one or in all the parts  and upon whatever chords we think proper  on the contrary in  fugues the melody must alternatively be heard in the two principal parts which are the treble and the bass unless instead of the treble we chuse another part and if the piece contains many parts it will be more perfect when the fugue is heard alternatively in each part Again  the chords that must be therein used do not depend upon our choice  Rameau's  Principles of Composition p  "  Thus much may be sufficient to shew that all our critic's depth of learning on the subject of musical composition must be of ancient date only since the greatest of the moderns both in  practice  and  theory  have rendered quite obsolete many of those rigid laws which only fetter the genius of those who would truly embellish their art  By depriving the composer of the liberty of changing or diversifying his subject his piece with frequent repetitions of the very same thought would be extremely languid and tedious whereas if he relieves  his first subject with others and these are relative to their principal in point of  air  and with regard to their  imitations  are chiefly conducted by the rules of  modulation  an allegro of this kind will have infinitely more spirit and variety than either the lifeless  counterpoint  or unmeaning  reverse  of throwing the air into one part only What the composer hath chiefly to observe in this conduct betwixt the extremes is a special regard to the chusing those subjects only which may naturally be connected as well in their  modulation  as  harmony  and are capable of preserving a similar air or discourse if the critic will admit to the conclusion of his piece  This method of introducing  the accidental subjects  in a musical composition may be handled like the like undercharacters in a dramatic performance which though the poet intends not that they should ever eclipse his heroe or principal he will nevertheless make natural and striking and it often happens that  though they are necessary to the support of his fable they do but just appear and no more is heard of them  It is frequent with the best composers of churchmusic to introduce a new subject at every change of the words An attempt of this nature in the instrumental way has given our critic much offence which I suppose he has considered as too bold an innovation upon the good old laws of harmony or did he think it an incroachment on the privilege of vocal Music and that no other should presume to aim at sense or the expression of any affection of the mind  In his reflections on the method of introducing the tenor he makes a strange pother about Music in four parts when in fact there is no such thing The  discords  it is true will admit of four parts but as the ear cannot rest on these alone therefore in every composition they must have their  preparations  and  resolutions  by  concords  which on that account will have the greatest share in the construction  of the harmony otherwise it cannot be called Music hence then as it is impossible to find any  concord  that can admit of more than three different notes so strictly speaking there can be but three parts in any musical composition since whatever number may be added to these they are no more than either  unisons  or  octaves  to their principals  I shall here take occasion to observe by way of information to my critic that notwithstanding a piece of Music is composed in four parts yet it does not follow that every  chord  or every  accented part  of the harmony should therefore have  four notes  or even  three  in many cases This kind of fullness is not always required because it often happens that the  tenor  or any other  part  being either an  octave  or  unison  with the  bass  or with  each other  will produce a more pleasing effect than when  otherwise accompanied  On this score however our critic has arraigned the taste of MARCELLO as forming his  choruses  upon the unisons of the  solo  or  principal parts  and thence prefers on all occasions the harmonical compositions of  four parts  not reflecting on those reasons which the sensible composer may assign for exerting his genius in  either  of these methods and which MARCELLO very happily has distinguished in the prodigious variety of movements that are in the work of his Psalms But this purblind critic though he owns his intimacy with them all could only see those which he thought he might abuse and abuse merely because they were contrary to his groveling taste  What offers next is the wonderful stress he has laid on some trifling disallowancesa mean kind of critique on the art of Music as these are errors which may escape the most painful corrections and may be found in the works of the most accurate composers I had almost said it is more than probable our critic may find them in his own  "Unfinish'd things one knows not what to call  "Their generation's so equivocal"  It were therefore impossible to retaliate his friendly advice by any minute survey of such unmeaning attempts in composition Perhaps too it might prove an unnecessary task having already sufficiently described them in the chapter on modulation from which he has transcribed an entire paragraph with such sensibility of resentment as makes me suspect he was conscious of somewhat he could not bear  See Essay p and Remarks p    In return for this mortification it seems as if he had vowed revenge and had determined not to allow me even the very first principles of thorough bass But in the fury of his charge he hath disarmed himself for he either does not know or at least is unwilling to acknowledge that there are many liberties allowable in musical composition as well as in other arts and especially in many cases that two or more perfect chords of the same kind may not only be dispensed with for the sake of some remarkable air or expression in any  one part  but that they may even  be produced to give a very pleasing effect from  many parts  together  The method of initiating pupils in Music into a thorough knowledge of the rules of  accompanyment  and the various  preparations  and  resolutions  of  discords  is necessary to explain what is proper to be done in this branch of art yet it is not sufficient to shew him  all  that may be done  Nature  is still superior to  art  and as the first principles of all science were primarily deduced from nature and have been brought by slow degrees to their present perfection so we may naturally conclude these improvements may yet be carried higher  In Music there are express laws relating to  modulation  as well as to  harmony  yet if all composers indiscriminately were confined to these laws we should soon see an end of all taste spirit and variety in their compositions and I don't know whether by this means we should not be deprived of one of the strongest efforts of  genius  viz that  of nobly  overleaping the too narrow bounds of human art  Some beauties yet no precepts can declare  For there's a happiness as well as care  Music resembles poetry in each  Are nameless graces which no methods teach  And which a masterhand alone can reach  If where the rules not far enough extend  Since rules were made but to promote their end  Some lucky licence answers to the full  Th' intent propos'd that licence is a rule  ESSAY on CRITICISM    To evince the truth of this if it were necessary I could point out instances to our critic in the works of many eminent composers though not perhaps in the meagre productions of those  Veterans  a list of whom he has given us in his remarks who it seems were such a set of  desperados  in their way that they sooner would have  "  spurned against the image of a saint than have taken two perfect chords of one kind together  "  But to return to my  A B C  critic  To do him all possible honour we must allow him to know which are false accompanyments in Music as  Bunyan  or  Quarles  may have understood what was false grammar in writing and in that case it is but justice to own he has pointed out some faults but such as his singular goodnature would not suffer him to perceive might be faults of the engraver or such as might easily escape the notice of the composer  To instance one of this kind will be sufficient In his first example he has discovered a  tritone  in the tenor and loudly exclaimed against the enormity of such a blunder Whereas had truth in reality been his aim he might have naturally supposed that the engraver had only omitted a  sharp  the placing of which would have removed all his mighty cause of clamour against the falseness of that  relation  Pains reading study are their just pretence  And all they want is spirit taste and sense  Commas and points they set exactly right  And 'twere a sin to rob them of their mite  EPISTLE to Dr ARBUTHNOT    But is it not obvious to every one how little conversant soever in the composition  of Music that among such a multiplicity of business which is necessary in the construction of harmony some things may be overseen some little characters omitted though of signal consequence in the work in spite of every endeavour to prevent such mistakes But those who are only moved with the implacable spirit of illnature will always either find or invent topics to gratify their malevolent tempersOf this happy class we may rank our masked annotator whose determined censures are but too glaringly the ebullitions of a mortified and splenetic humour  THOMAS MORLEY from whom our critic has drawn his musical learning and produced in his remarks that collection of the old  English  composers whose names he suspects to have ever come to my knowledge this venerable author himself was not exempt from this tax of censure or calumny rather for writing an useful book and presuming to distinguish himself among his brethren Here are his very words  "  But seeing in these latter daies and doting age of the world there is nothing more subject to calumnie and backbiting then that which is most true and right and that as there be many who will enter into the reading my booke for their instruction so I doubt not but diverse also will reade it not so much for any pleasure or profit they looke for in it as to find something whereat to repine or take occasion of backbiting such men I warne that if in friendship they will either publickly or privately make mee acquainted with any thing in the booke which either they like not or understand not I will not onely be content to give them a reason and if I cannot to turn to their opinion but also thinke my self highly beholding to them  Preface to  Morley's  Introduction to Musicke  "    But to proceed with  his  RemarksIn the above first example the two instances of a  ninth  being prepared in the  eighth  is a false charge because he supposes the last and passing note in the bass to give that  preparation  whereas it is prepared in the  accented note  of the  division  which is a  fifth  and therefore an allowable  preparation  this he might easily have perceived had he reduced that  division  in the  bass  to its  fundamental  or  accented harmony  The false  resolution  which he has deigned to correct is this  "The discord improperly  resolved  is in the last bar between the bass and the alto where B is tied as a ninth to A but instead of resolving it into the eighth according  to the rule it rises to the third directly contrary to it""How easy to have made it otherwise I need not prove however the directs shew it very clearly"  Shew whatThat our doctor is not quite so wise as he thought himself for this very direct would occasion  two eighths  between the  alto  and the  second violin  a fault which on all occasions he is very highly offended with Besides I must here acquaint him that the resolution of the  ninth  into the  third  and  third minor  especially is by no means against the rule because it is agreeable to the ear and furthermore Lord ABERCORN saith  "the  ninth  is resolved in a  third  a  sixth  or an  eighth  from every one of the concords it is prepared in  c  "  And if the example from his favourite Doctor CROFTS will not convince him I doubt he must erase the Doctor's name from the list of his chaste  English  worthies for I could direct my critic in the anthems of this author to  many examples of a like kind with the  two  here annexed  As to the errors of two  perfect chords  of the same kind I will confess to him that I am so hardened a sinner on certain occasions against  his  John Trott laws that I have more than once intentionally offended and if he cannot perceive the reason it will scarce be worth while to inform him  It may not be amiss to offer the following remark on the whole of this exampleThe modulation in a  flat key  it is well known is very different from  that  in the  sharp key  the  former  being the same whether you ascend or descend whereas if you ascend in the  latter  the  sixth  must be  sharp  though it is  flat  in descending hence the  false fifth  and even the  tritone  cannot always be avoided It is therefore to this imperfection in the  scale of Music  you must impute the C  sharp  in the  tenor  and the omission of not figuring  that sharp  in the  bass  And this is the cause of our critic's assigning  to the above example the worst singing he ever heard Nevertheless these false relations are allowable in  quick movements  and may be found in the very best compositions but in  slow movements  where they can neither be  accented  nor even made  passing notes  they are extremely disagreeable and it seems indeed as if our critic had treated this dissonant  tritone  in a very solemn way having no doubt tried and retried it upon his harpsichord till dwelling on the discord might sufficiently raise his spleen for the business he had undertaken  N  o  To this first example in notes is added another bass to shew the  accented  harmony in that part by which it evidently appears that the  last  note in the division or supposed bass hath no sort of  accompanyment  in any of the parts and therefore cannot possibly be included in the general harmony How then can this  unaccented unaccompanied  and  swiftpassing note  be supposed to prepare the  discord  Then judge ye candid composers whether this caviling critic might not blush at so unfair a charge did he not wear a mask to hide his shame  The two  perfect fifths  in the tenor are obviated by removing  one note  and the  tritone  by adding a  sharp  For the other example which shews the  ninth  resolved in a  third  see CROFTS's  Anthems  vol i p Ps vi and bar    Example the second contains a very curious remark on the passion intended to be there expressed  "It is seemingly like the  whimpering  and  whining  of a boy who dreads a flogging and goes unwillingly to school  c  "  But he has done me an honour in this place which he did not intend for as I have always thought that the passions might be very powerfully expressed as well by instrumental Music as by vocal therefore in my little attempts that way I have generally aimed at some peculiar expression But it seems our critic has had correction so much in his head that he could not conceive how the  plaintive style  could be otherwise described Or perhaps he formed his judgement of this passage from his own manual execution of it and then indeed I will not dispute with him but it might  whine  and  whimper  just in the manner he describes it  The close of his paragraph on this head may be quoted as a sample of his prodigious sagacity in making discoveries  "I shall only add that if the passages had been less delicate the imitations more just and the harmony in the  tutti  more  perfect  and  complete  it would have been infinitely better Music"  Or in other words if  every part  had been good  the whole  had been betterA most notable conclusion  N  o  Contains the whipping piece but is here omitted being only a matter of taste between the critic and his author and perhaps too it might rather seem cruel to produce the rod again  "however gracefully it may be brandished" Rem p    Example the third where the  ninth  is prepared in the  eighth  I acknowledge is so far an oversight as strictly speaking it offends against an established rule and therefore I should have thought myself obliged to him for his remark had he corrected with candor If that had been the case he might have supposed this rule was dispensed with for the sake of the  subject  which is heard in the two principal parts and to which that passage in the second violin wherein is contained the disallowance is only an accompanyment  and there intended not to overpower the effect of the fugue and also to preserve a similar  air  or movement with the upper part However as these and many other liberties are frequently taken by the greatest composers I shall produce only one from that deservedly admired song  Ombra cara  in Mr HANDEL's Opera of  Rhadamistus  this you may remember is a very  slow  movement whereas in the instance which our critic has noted the movement is  rapid  and consequently any disagreeable effect that might otherwise be found from the disallowance is here lost in the flight of its progress  N  o  The minum G in the last bar is F in the concertos which no doubt is the same also in our critic's manuscript this circumstance trifling as it is may serve to convince him that  printers  may commit  errors  in a  large work  as well as in a  small one  In the third bar of the second example the  ninth  is prepared in the  eighth  which is the  accented  note  The third of these examples where the  ninth  is prepared in the  eighth  is taken from a full anthem of Doctor CROFTS's vol i p Ps vi and st bar  N  o      st  Ex    d  Ex  ombra cara di mia sposa deh riposa lieta as    d  Ex  neither thy displeasure pleasure neither chasten me in thy dis    The fourth example contains a criticism as strange as he hath represented the fault to be His question is  "Pray in what part is the discord I doubt not but your answer will be Where the binding is"  And where else can it be placed And thus he proceeds  "Why then are the figures and put there For they manifestly make the upper parts discords but then why are they not  resolved  if the bass be a discord the second maketh it so and the seventh most certainly is a false accompanyment"  To all this I answer that the and are placed there because the bass stands still For when the parts are driving each other and the bass keeps its note the accompanyments on that account must often be  extraneous  and where the  tastosolo  or striking of one key is not directed the holding note should be always completely figured and thence the and may frequently be found together In this case every  discord  out of the common rule of  figuratedescant  may be considered as a kind of  appoggiatura  or leaning note where the  discord  is often strongly expressed and the succeeding  concord  but just dropped upon the ear But this is an innovation against the venerable fathers of harmony and brought in by the  Italians  I am not therefore surprized that our orthodox critic hath exclaimed so violently against it  But there is another circumstance attending this example which our critic was not aware of and with all his amazement at the strangeness of this passage he has shewn if possible more folly than illnature If he does not know that the work of  melody  may also be exerted and most happily too in the  basses  of musical composition I will refer him to the  operas  of RAMEAU where he will find these  appoggiaturas  and a certain melody in the bass peculiar as yet indeed to this composer giving the finest effects that can possibly be imagined  As to his remark on the thinness of the  tenor  in this example he may recollect what I have said in my directions to performers at the head of these concertos where it is expressly mentioned with the reasons there assigned why the  tenor  is intended throughout the whole of that work as an auxiliary rather than as a separate part  No  First  example shews the  appoggiatura  in the bass being the cause of our critic's amazement and blundering in this place  The  second  shews the harmony independent of the  appoggiatura  and in the  third  the two  principal parts  are inverted which proves the harmony to be just  You will observe that in the second and third examples there is added a new  tenor  The reason is this The  melody  of this passage in the  bass  being in a great measure taken away a  fuller harmony  is substituted as there is no particular  air  which it may  overpower  whereas in the first example the  tenor  is unison with the bass to  enforce  the expression of the  appoggiatura  or  melody  in that part  N  o      st  Ex    d  Ex    d  Ex    In the fifth example he has manifestly overlooked a superior design which at all events he would sacrifice to a slavish regard of very minute disallowances and as he hath particularly challenged in this place my audacious attempts both as  a composer and critic he must pardon me if therefore I dispute his own pretensions in this case His allegation is this  "Suppose the question were put to a young practitioner in thoroughbass What are the proper consequents of G  sharp  in the bass with a  seventh  figured to it Would not his answer be The G  sharp  is a plain indication that A should be the following note and the  seventh  which is F  natural  will expect to find its  resolution  in E  natural  "  To this I need only observe that as the question is put to a  learner  so the answer is such as a  learner  only could give But if he had put the same question to a master he would have shewn him that these  resolutions  may be varied many ways and that otherwise it would be a vain attempt in the composer to produce variety in his work seeing every novice might beforehand suggest when any particular chord was struck what next was to follow  In this example our remarker hath roundly asserted that the  allegro  preceding the  adagio  No is concluded with a  full cadence  in D with its  sharp third  in order no doubt to shew the bad effect of the succeeding modulation into a  flat key  But this is not fact the  allegro  being closed in the  fifth  of the key and therefore an  imperfect cadence  which like the  colon  in writing leaves the ear in expectation of something to follow and with regard to a musical composition the modulation in that case may deviate with greater freedom from the common rule  N  o  The  imperfect cadence  which forms the close of the  allegro  is here annexed to shew that our critic misinformed his friend when he said this  allegro  was concluded by a  full cadence  N  o  and convey nothing so it was thought needless to produce them here again  Thus by the appearance of these maimed examples in notes designed no doubt by such  scraps  to catch the  eye  and exclude the  ear  our notable projector imagined he had fairly submitted his  reasonable  critique to the judgement of the public but may not  eve  too imagine in our turn that as the principles of composition are obvious but to  few  he trusted the  multitude  would not see into his flimsy objections I have therefore thought it worth while not only to clear myself of the injustice he would have done me had it been in his power but also to shew the imposition he would lay on the art of Music itself by exposing his narrow and unexperienced notions in composition    The remaining examples and make an excellent close to his critical remarks for whatever errors they are intended to shew no person unacquainted with the movement from whence they are taken can form any just notion about them If they are designed as specimens of the composer's contrivance the critic has indeed acted consistently to the last because if in these and his other examples he had produced the several pieces entire to which they belong this ingenuous method might not so well have answered his determined purpose of censure Perhaps he was aware of this for notwithstanding he hath assured his friend that he had not scored  all  the  concertos  we are not sworn to believe him nor can I otherwise infer from the nature of his  Remarks but that his sole intention was a seeking of errors I shall therefore leave him with this frank confession which I have borrowed from EPICTETUS which he may also call an  affectation of learning  if he pleases that if he were as intimate with the faults of these  concertos  as I am he would find a great many more  Thus I have gone regularly through all the objections which this doughty antagonist has been pleased to raise against these  concertos  But I fancy I shall be easily excused from taking the same pains with his coarse and wordy comment on the Essay itself in which like a true polemic he has laid down but one rule or principle of writing namely to oppose at all events whatever I had advanced and to pervert every plain passage which even so perverted he had not talents to confute  To give one instanceThe heat of his rage seems to be kindled at the affront which he would insinuate I have put upon the  English  composers And to  draw their severest resentment upon me he hath also as falsely insinuated that I have equally injured the great original which they have imitated  Then he produces the following passage  "The  Italians  seem particularly indebted to the variety and invention of SCARLATTI and  France  has produced a RAMEAU equal if not superior to LULLY The  English  as yet indeed have not been so successful but whether this may be owing to any inferiority in the original they have chose to imitate or to a want of genius in those that are his imitators in distinguishing perhaps not the most excellent of his works it is not necessary here to determine  See Essay p  "  This he calls a saucy insinuation But saucy to whom If to his Doctorship only I am entirely unconcerned about it But if to Mr HANDEL I would be the first to condemn it and erase it from my Essay this however I believe none but our  critic will suspect though every one will easily perceive his reason for quoting and perverting it  viz  to take off the odium from such meagre composers as himself and to throw it all upon the character of Mr HANDEL  I could wish to know whence this unnatural conjunction comes and what Mr HANDEL has done that he deserves to be treated with that air of familiarity which our author puts on when he calls him his  See the Remarks p  brother  Poor Doctor  I know not what tables of affinity or consanguinity can prove you even his cousingerman Is Mr HANDEL an  Englishman  is his very name  English  was his education  English  was he not first educated in the  Italian  school did he not compose and direct the  Italian  operas here many years It is true he has since deigned to strengthen the delicacy of the  Italian  air so as to bear the rougher accent of our language But to call him on that account brother to such composers  as our  Doctor  I am persuaded is an appellation that he would reject with the contempt it deserves  With respect to my countrymen I thought I had shewn a very high regard to their genius and abilities when I endeavoured to prove that by an unprejudiced intercourse with the world in general and by a right application of their own natural good sense the  English  might undoubtedly receive and  improve  those advantages which other nations had experienced from a like conduct and without which no distinct people of themselves and no professors in any art whatever can expect to excel  Nevertheless our sanguine critic has treated this impartiality as relinquishing the merits of my own countrymen nor will he be satisfied with any thing less than a plenary acknowledgement that they are not only superior to all other nations in their musical abilities but in all former times have deserved the same preeminenceSuch a position must surely  seem false and highly absurd to all judges who esteem it a virtue to be  national  but not to be  bigoted  But it is the indelible stamp of mean and trifling spirits to envy and depreciate the talents of those whom they vainly strive to rivalTo this we may justly impute the false odium which some have endeavoured to throw on this nation as an encourager of foreign artistsCan any thing redound more to its real glory does not this generous regard to merit of whatever country spread the name and genius of the  English  to the most distant climes and render them an honour to human nature  With regard to Music had we been left to ourselves without the least intercourse with other nations it is hard to say what might have been the reigning taste If we may judge from the high claims of those professors who contemptuously reject all foreign improvements I am afraid we should have had no great cause to boast of any superior excellence  Yet perhaps I may be mistaken had this been the case it is not improbable but as the names of HANDEL BONONCINI GEMINIANI  c  had then never been heard of our Doctor would have reigned at present supreme over our musical kingdom and proved his hereditary right by a lineal descent from his  great forefather  Doctor BULL  The following extract from the  Fasti Oxon  will I apprehend entertain the reader as at once giving him a character of this  famous Doctor  and an idea of the taste of that sort of Music which our remarker so highly applauds  "JOHN BULL that prodigy of a man see Remarks on the Essay p who had practised the faculty of Music for years was then admitted bachelor of MusicThis person who had a most prodigious hand on the organ and was famous throughout the religious world for his church Music the words of some of which are extant had been trained up under an excellent master named BLITHMAN organist of queen ELIZABETH's chapel who died much lamented in This BLITHMAN perceiving that he had a natural geny to the faculty spared neither time nor labour to advance it to the utmost So that in short time he being more than master of it which he shewed by his most admirable compositions played and sung in many churches beyond the seas as well as at home he took occasion to go  incognito  into  France  and  Germany  At length hearing of a famous musician belonging to a certain cathedral at St  Omer's  as I have heard he applied himself as a novice to him to learn something of his faculty and to see and admire his works This musician after some discourse had passed between them conducted BULL to a  vestry  or Music school joining to the cathedral and shewed to him a  lesson  or  song of forty parts  and then made a vaunting challenge to any person in the world to add one more part to them supposing it to be so compleat and full that it was impossible for any mortal to correct or add to it BULL thereupon desiring the use of ink and ruled paper such as we call musical paper prayed the musician to lock him up in the said school for or hours which being done not without great disdain by the musician BULL in that time or less added  forty more parts  to the said  lesson  or  song  The musician thereupon being called in he viewed it tried it and retried it At length he burst out into a great ectasy and swore by the great God that  he that added those forty parts must either be the devil or Dr Bull  c"  But which of these eminent personages had the greatest share in this wonderful performance we are not able to determine seeing it hath perished in the wreck of time from which not even all its fourscore parts could defend it Nevertheless the fame of these great musical deeds hath lived in the records of  Parnassus  and no doubt but our critic by his vicinity to that happy mansion hath already in view the distant eminence of being enrolled among those chiefs who have done such wonders    Having placed our Doctor on his  throne in this ideal kingdom I very respectfully take my leave of himBut in a sentence or two more I will beg leave to deliver my sentiments of Mr HANDEL which I am sure will contradict nothing I have said in my Essay and I flatter myself will be assented to by the  rational  part of our musical judges  Mr HANDEL is in Music what his own DRYDEN was in poetry nervous exalted and harmonious but voluminous and consequently not always correct Their abilities equal to every thing their execution frequently inferior Born with genius capable of  soaring the boldest flights  they have sometimes to suit the vitiated taste of the age they lived in  descended to the lowest  Yet as both their excellencies are infinitely more numerous than their deficiencies so both their characters will devolve to latest posterity not as models of perfection yet glorious examples of those  amazing powers that actuate the human soul  I am SIR Your most humble servant CHARLES AVISON  Newcastle      POSTSCRIPT  I Shall here give the remark of a friend  "You have spoken of  Aristotle  p as of one who did not hold an eminent rank amongst the sons of  Apollo  but played a sort of  second repieno  in that  concert  I am somewhat afraid lest you should offend certain  Academics  who upon this occasion may let fly at you a syllogism in  Barbara  or  Bocardo  and attack you with  authorities  I would therefore advise you to add that  Cicero  and  Quintilian  represent  Aristotle  as one of the most ingenious elegant and polite writers which affords a favourable presumption that his verses cannot be bad and yet on the other hand who more eloquent than  Cicero  whose verses are certainly of the family of the  Mediocres  It is also to be  observed that this philosopher exercised his talents in the poetic way composed a  scholium  or hymn some distichs  c  and is commended as a good poet by  Julius Scaliger Daniel Heinsius  and  Rapin  The first of these critics went so far as to affirm that he was in no respect inferior to  Pindar  But for thir partial determination of  Scaliger  when he went to the  Elysian  fields  "  The Lyrics all against him rose  "  And  Pindar  pull'd him by the nose  "Let us then rather be favourable than severe in our judgement upon this great genius and leave his  poetical  ambiguous till they be decided by your  antagonist  when he shall find himself able and willing to settle this  counterpoint  and to discuss the  pro  and the  con  "  You may thus read in p  Though  Aristotle  may justly be styled  father of criticism and true judgement  in poetry and though he was himself a composer of verses yet he holds not the same rank amongst the poets as amongst
