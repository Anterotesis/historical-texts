 Liberty Asserted A TRAGEDY As it is Acted at the NEW THEATRE IN  Little Lincoln'sInnFields  Written by Mr DENNIS  LONDON  Printed for  George Strahan  at the  Golden Ball  against the  Royal Exchange  in  Cornhill  and  Bernard Lintott  at the  MiddleTempleGate  in  Fleetstreet  Price  s    d  Liberty Asserted  A TRAGEDY  TO ANTHONY HENLEY  Esq  SIR  THIS Play of  Liberty Asserted  is by the right of Nature Yours not only as You are a zealous Lover of Your Country and a generous Assertor of Liberty but as it owes its Birth and its very Being to You For it was You Sir who gave the happy Hint upon which this Poem was form'd from You  from a Source of noble Sentiments it descended to Me and 'tis from Me that with a just Ambition it ascends to You  If I had had the Happiness to be nearer to You during the time that I was writing this Tragedy if as I at first receiv'd the Hint from You I could have receiv'd Your Instructions about the Design and the Working of the Scenes the Faults in this Poem had then been fewer and the Present more worthy You But I know that the Nobleness of Your English Principles will oblige You to excuse its Faults on Consideration of the just Intention with the which it was writ and that was no less than to do good to Your Country to open the Eyes of deluded Men to inspire them with the Love of Liberty and unite and animate them against the Common Foe of  Europe  But yet if at last I did not flatter my self that this  Play had many more Beauties than Faults You should be the very last Person to whom I would chuse to address it If You appear to be of the same Opinion I have gain'd the chief Ends which I propose to my self in Writing and that is to do a little Good to distinguish my self by what I write and by those to whom I address my self I shall look upon Your Approbation as a glorious Earnest of Fame for Truth will be sure at last to prevail and that which we call Taste in Writing is nothing but a fine Discernment of Truth But as Truth must be always one and always the same to all who have Eyes to discern it he who pleases one of a true Taste at first is sure of pleasing all the World at last But I who have sometimes had the Honour to hear You talk of Criticism have been a long time throughly convinc'd that from an Intimacy with the Ancients and a just Knowledge of the Moderns You have form'd that fine and admirable Taste which is so rarely found among us But I ought to consider that while I commend it I may perhaps displease it and ought in Discretion to say no more I am  SIR  Your most humble and most obedient Servant JOHN DENNIS  PREFACE  AS the Entertainments of our Theatres are publick and supported by publick Authority it is but just that the Instruction which is the ultimate end of them should tend to the publick Advantage 'Tis true indeed the Stage by correcting particular Persons has a natural tendency to the improving the Publick But when I say that the Publick ought to receive Advantage from the Entertainments of our Theatres I mean that it ought to do so immediately and that the Instructions which we receive from the Stage ought to be for the Benefit of the lawful establish'd Government  That this was the Case among the  Athenians  appears plain to me and the reason why they settled so vast a Fund upon the Tragick Stage was because they regarded it as the very Barrier of Liberty which it supported by exposing the Misfortunes of Tyrants and the Calamities that attended upon Arbitrary Pow'r And it seems to me to be for this reason that they had that high Esteem for  Oedipus  and were at so uncommon an Expence in the Decoration of it because both the Crimes and the Calamities of  Oedipus  were the Consequences of his assuming unlimited Pow'r 'Tis true he kill'd his Father before he came to be King but it was by ascending the Throne that he committed Incest and that he came to the knowledge of what he had done and had he continued a private Man he had neither known the Guilt of his Actions nor had he felt the Punishment of them  As the  Athenians  had Liberty with a Commonwealth the  English  enjoy the very same Liberty under the Government of the best of Queens and in so doing are the happiest People in the World I thought therefore that I could not do a thing that would be more acceptable to all true Englishmen than to cas  in my Mite towards the defending and supporting of that Liberty  That the Liberties of  Europe  and of this Island particularly are in no small Danger at present from the growing Power of  France  will be easily granted by all but such who are either Fools or Knaves too incorrigible to be talk'd too But this is plain that they are not so much in danger from what some call the Greatness of the  French  as from the Baseness of the rest of  Europe  If we were but as true to Liberty as the  French  are to Tyranny they would soon be as despicable in their Circumstances as they are now in their Principles 'Tis the want of publick Spirit that ruins us and the Design of this Tragedy is to inculcate that this being its important Moral that the want of publick Spirit in the Members of any Community makes not only the publick but very often those private Persons who want it▪ very unhappy that whoeven sells or betrays his Country either to a foreign Tyrant as some of the Confederates or to a homebred one as the whole Body of the  French  do whoever does this upon the account of advancing his Family which is the general Motive to such publick Treasons is sure to have himself and his Family suffer with the rest and perhaps with the foremost And this Moral is prov'd by the Dramatick Action both ways It shews a Man who makes a Treaty with the  French  upon private Interest made by that Treaty the most wretched of Mankind of the happiest that he was before and it shews the very Frenchman who breaks it about to be plung'd by the Breach of it in the most deplorable Calamity and it shews something farther too that the  French  who are the Instruments of promoting Tyranny upon a private Interest are so only because they are so far blinded by their Passions that they know not what they do that is they know not that they are sacrificing to their Tyrant their very Children and Families for whose Support they pretend to act that if their other Passions did not conccal this from them all of them who have any thing of natural Affection would be so far from being guilty of so unnatural a Villany that they would immediately declare for Liberty  Some People may perhaps admire that I who have been accus'd of repeating the same thing in the Play the Prologue and Epilogue should yet appear to be farther guilty of that very Fault in the Preface To whom I answer That since after all the Care I had taken in the Play the Prologue and Epilogue to assure the World  that this was an English and not a Party Play there were some malicious enough to affirm that this was a Play writ purposely to oblige the Whigs I thought it lay upon me to prove what I had affirm'd before that this was not a Whig but an English Play which I shall manifestly I believe make out unless they will urge that because it is an English therefore it is a Whiggish Play  If this Play is writ for a Party why then it must be writ against a Party Now it will be pretty plain from what has been said above considered with the Play it self that the Design of this Tragedy is to make Men in Love with Liberty by shewing them that nothing can be more according to Nature and by shewing this not by such forcible and extraordinary Arguments as require more than ordinary Penetration to be understood for that has been already done so incomparably by Mr  Lock  that nothing need or can be added to it but by something so plain that ev'ry Understanding is capable of it and that is by the most Tender of all Sentiments which Nature has implanted in the Minds of Men and that is the Love of their Children The Party therefore that this Play was writ to oblige are all those who have any concern for their Country their Religion their Relations their Friends and their Children and the Party it was writ against are all those who care not one farthing for any or all of these Now I would give a good deal to behold so abominable a Wretch as to own himself of such a Party  He who writes for a Party writes for Interest now I would fain ask any one where can be my Interest in writing for the Party for which it is supposed that I write The first thing that I wrote which had relation to the Publick was a Poem call'd  The Court of Death  in which I lamented the Death of the late Queen of happy and glorious Memory And tho' both the Design and Spirit of that Poem were thought by some of the best Judges to be above the common level of Poetry yet I was almost the only Person of all the Writers who appear'd upon that Subject of whom the Court took no notice My Friends can bear me Witness that I was so far from being mortified at it that I was resolv'd to persevere in what I thought my Duty and of all the foresaid Writers I was afterwards  the only Person who bewail'd the Death of the late King in the same publick manner that I had before lamented that of his Royal Consort I had almost the same Fortune with that Poem that I had with the former It brought me indeed a little more Reputation but just as much Advantage  He who after this could be induc'd to expect any thing from those whom they call the Whigs must be of a more sanguine Temper than I am I know indeed that there are a great many People whom they call Whigs who are really Englishmen and to oblige Englishmen I shall be always proud by what Names soever they may be distinguished By a real Englishman I mean one who is for the present Establishment and the Protestant Succession upon the view of the good of his Countrey and his own no farther than as it depends on the other  But upon the first acting this Tragedy there were not wanting some worthy Persons who made it their Business to report about the Town that it was a Republican Play Now to give them an Answer to which nothing can be replyed I have ordered the last Scene of the Play to be printed which on the account of Length was left out in Acting tho' it yet remains in the Playhousecopy At the same time I desire the Reader to believe that I am not such a Fool to contend for Names but for Things that Liberty is Liberty under a limited Monarchy as much as under a Commonwealth that we enjoy enough under the present Queen to make us the happiest of People that I have as high a Veneration for Her as any Subject She has and would venture as much to serve Her because I am perfectly convinc'd that all that She aims at by Her perpetual Care and the Wisdom of Her Conduct is to support and defend these Liberties which Her glorious Predecessour deliver'd to us and which 'tis the Business of this Play to assert and vindicate So that the Design of this Tragedy being only to promote the good Intentions of the Queen it is more Her Interest than it is any Persons in  England  that it should make the Impression which it was design'd to make tho' I believe it at the same time to be the Interest of ev'ry Person in  England  excepting those who are wishing for a French Government or contriving to bring it in  This is not the first time that since Her Majesties happy Accession  to Her Throne I have endeavour'd to serve Her And all the world knows that it is not my Fault that I have not done Her a most important Service  Proposal for putting a speedy end to the War  c  sold by Mrs  Baldwin  Had that been done there had been no need of writing the following Tragedy There had been no need of firing People with the Love of Liberty or animating them against the common Foe Had that been done the Liberties of  Europe  and our own had been sufficiently secur'd  I know very well that the foregoing Declaration is not over politick that to declare for the Publick against Parties is to make no Friends I am perfectly convinc'd that if I could be brought to espouse any Party warmly that Party might be brought to espouse me but that till I make that step I must be left to my self of this I say I am perfectly convinc'd and yet notwithstanding that Conviction I hope in God I shall not change my Conduct  The Success of this Play has been so favourable notwithstanding Malice and ill Accidents it has had the Felicity of having so many illustrious Voices for it that I may spare my self the Trouble of answering Objections However since good Manners appear to be concern'd in two of them I shall say a word to those  The first is that there are in this Play National Reflections which ought not to be made To which I answer that I plainly perceive that the Art of the following Tragedy is by no means all understood That part of it consists in this that what some mistake for a National Satyr is only a Satyr upon Arbitrary Power a Satyr upon the Government of the French and not upon their Manners as they proceed from their Climate The French are in themselves a brave and a gallant Nation but the Submission which they fondly pay to unlimited Power has plung'd them in Vices which their Natures abhor and render'd them odious and despicable To shew this I have introduced the Characters of two Frenchmen  Frontenac  and  Miramont  who are both of them Men of Honour but the difference between them is this that  Miramont  who declares against Arbitrary Pow'r is altogether without Blemish and the Faults and Defects in  Frontenac  's Character are plainly deriv'd  from his Zeal for their present Government  The other Objection is this that the Satyr in the Ambassadors Scene is too course for delicate Ears I know it very well and in complaisance to some Gentlemen whom I esteem I order'd it to be left out after the first Night but I have printed it with the rest because they who do not like it may turn over it and because it is likely to be subservient to the end for which this Poem was writ and that is to animate our  English  against the  French  for I believe it may not be unacceptable to some honest downright Englishmen who while we and the  French  are cutting one anothers Throats will not take it ill that we do it without Ceremony  The Scene of this Tragedy lies at  Agnie  in  Canada  which for the sake of the better sound I call  Angie Canada  is a vast Tract of Land in  Northern America  on the Back of  New England  and  New York  As  New England  and  New York  and the Country about them belong to the  English  a considerable part of  Canada  is possess'd by the  French  and as the  English  and  French  divide the Country they divide the Natives The most considerable Nation of  Canada  next to the  Iroquois  are the  Hurons  who are Friends to the  French  But the five Warlike Nations of the  Iroquois  are our Confederates of those five Nations  Agnies  or  Angies  is one and the chief Place of the Nation is  Agnie  or  Angie  and thus much I thought fit to premise for the Sake of those who have never read either  Hennepin  or  La Hontan  But now it will be convenient to say a word concerning the Scenes as they are mark'd in the printed Play and here▪ by the word Scene I do not mean so much the Place as the Number of Persons who are in Action upon that Place at a time I have therefore distinguish'd the Scenes in the following Play as they have been always distinguish'd by the Ancients and by the Moderns of other Countries and by our own  Ben Johnson  Any Person who comes upon the Place of Action or leaves it makes a different Scene and that new Scene is mark'd by the Figure of its respective Number and the Names of the Persons who are upon the Place of Action I thought that agreeable Delusion into which the Reader willingly and gladly enters for the sake of his Pleasure would be both greater and easier if he were not put in mind  of a Stage by  Entrances  and  Exits  which are nothing but Direrections that are given to a Play House Prompter  The Design of this Play was much improv'd by the Remonstrances which I receiv'd from my valued Friend Mr  Southern  who besides his Zeal to do good to his Friends and a noble Sincerity uncommon among the Writers of this Age by the  ex tempore  Remarks which he made upon my reading this Play to him in a very hasty manner shew'd at once so much penetrating Quickness as well as so much Solidity and so much sureness as could belong to no Man but one who has a thorough Understanding of Nature and who has that admirable Talent for touching the Passions which he has shewn in his Tragedies I must own the Obligation too which I have to Mr  Betterton  for the Hints I received from him as well as for his excellent Action  This Play indeed receiv'd all the Grace and Ornament of Action in most of the principal Parts and in all the Womens But that of  Sakia  by Mrs  Barry  was acted so admirably and inimitably as that no Stage in  Europe  can boast of any thing that comes near to her Performance or if the Foreign Stages can shew any thing like it they are at least prodigiously improv'd since I was upon the Continent That incomparable Actress changing like Nature which she represents from Passion to Passion from Extream to Extream with piercing Force and with  Grace changes the Hearts of all who see her with irresistible Pleasure  ERRATA  Page for  commends  read  commands  p for  the glorious Sphears  r  that glorious Sphear  p for  more at variance  r  ne'er at variance  p for  again is an  r  again in an  PROLOGUE  Spoke by Mr  Betterton  THIS of deep Tragedies is sure the Age  When  Mars  each day displays with swelling Rage  His bloody Scenes upon the Worlds great Stage  Ye  Brittons  from your  Thames  's Silver Flood  Turn turn your Eyes to Streams distain'd with Blood  And to discover Scenes of mortal Woe  Survey the  Rhine  the  Danube  and the  Poe  No fancy'd Tragedies are acting there  There the distracted Native rends his Hair  And shrieks and wrings his Hands in true Despair  While no vexatious Griefs to you are known  But here you meet t'attend our pleasing moan  And gently figh with Sorrow not your own  By grateful Turns with Fear and Pity seiz'd  And when most terrify'd are then most pleas'd  But Tragick Scenes may come where this Delight  Shall yield to Horrour and to mortal Fright  When impious  Mars  shall with a dreadful Roar  Descend to visit pale  Britannia  's Shore  Already Treason whispers come away  And clamorous Discord cries make no delay  That Hour would shew a Tragedy indeed  Whose sad Spectators would not weep but bleed  Which to prevent all Patriots should contend  These Scenes were wrought to serve so just an end  To shew our inbred Foes ere 'tis too late  That they and theirs must share the common Fate  For  France  its Blood exhausts its Wealth expends  T'obtain its own and not our Plotters ends  They who their Country for themselves enthrall  Will see themselves and Children with it fall  Would they reflect on this while yet they may  Themselves and Children they would ne'er betray  As in the following Scenes we shew to Day  For what Remains  To please and to instruct we've done our best  Then boldly let us make this just Request  With silent care to the first Act attend  Then you with Pleasure may

a banish'd Race in Foreign Lands  The fiercest Creatures that the Woods contain  What they bring forth with pleasing Love maintain  That Love the Lyon softens and the Bear  The Worlds supported by

Oh may she long command these happy Isles  Where she with Freedom Empire reconciles  Long o'er your Hearts may yon bright Circle Reign  Oh may you never feel a ruder Chain  And of no other Tyranny

something that's important  Okim  Then briefly thus  Beaufort  that jointly with your valiant Son  Led forth his English and our Iroquois  To stop th' Incursions of the French and Hurons  Is just from our Confederate Troops arriv'd  Sak  Alas how fares my  Ulamar  Okim  Before the Sun which now declines is sett  You may expect to hear it from himself  For  Beaufort  left him just prepar'd to follow  Sak  Now the great Mind be praised  My Son has lost then and the French are Victors  Okim  No my  Sakia    The Ruler of the World is not so partial  Nor are the Guardian Spirits so remiss  Which hover with their golden Wings o'er  Canada  Your lovely Son th' auspicious  Ulamar    No less the Darling is of Heav'n than ours  A thousand French and Hurons pale and breathless  Extended on yon Plain proclaim him Victor  And in the bloody Bus'ness of the Day  No single Arm dealt Fate so much as  Ulamar  's  Sak  Ah wretched me thou hast rowz'd all my Griefs  Okim  How my  Sabia  Is your Son's Triumph then become your Grief  His Death had been your Joy then  Sak  Ah no thou know'st I dote upon my  Ulamar    And when the Graces of his Mind and Person  With Reason's Eye severely I survey  Reason severely judging yet assures me  That I have cause for all the Mother's Fondness  Yet know my  Okima    His Death and Victory I fear'd alike  Okim  You utter Mysteries beyond my Reach  Sak  Thou know'st my Son that with the generous  Beaufort  Now leads the bloody Iroquois to Battel  No Iroquois by Birth no Native is of  Angie  Okim  I know you both indeed by Birth are Hurons  Sak  Hurons we once were call'd and once were thought  To be descended from no Vulgar Stock  But now alas are sunk to wretched Slaves▪  Okim  To Slaves  Sakia  Your Son at least has other Sentiments  Sak  Howe'er alas my Son may be deceiv'd  I am a Slave a miserable Slave  Who far remov'd from my sweet Native Soil  Far from the dearer Partner of my Heart  Have for twelve tedious Years been now confin'd  To drag the galling Yoke of loathsome Life  In this accursed Place  A Burthen which I never could support  But that I had some glimpse of Hope remaining  That cruel Fortune might at length relent  And might at length restore me with my  Ulamar    To the dear Partner of my faithful Heart  Those Hopes have lately been reviv'd and animated  By the prophetick Visions of the Night  And Expectation of this fatal Action  But this Relation has o'erthrown them all  My Son's mistaken Valour has undone us  And thou O  Miramont  art lost for ever  Okim  Forget your Hurons and become an Angian  Sak  O may the whole accursed Race by Fate  Be rooted ev'n from Human Memory  Perish their very Names too with their Persons  Excepting thine for thou art wondrous good  Okim  Sakia  you forget  To curse your Benefactors thus is impious  Sak  To curse our mortal Enemies is just  Okim  The Angians are your Friends and your Defenders  Sak  My Country's mortal Enemies are mine  Okim  Iroquian Angie  is your Country now  Sak  My Prison never can be call'd my Country  Okim  The Angians gave you Liberty at first  The Hour that made you Captives saw you free  Sak  Why am I then with my unhappy Son  Detain'd e'er since in this detested Clime  Enjoying nothing but the Name of Liberty  Which hourly brings the thing to my Remembrance  And makes the Yoke of Slav'ry wring me more  Know that I'm not deluded by a Word  And ev'n this Shadow of the Angians Favour  Is due to the Request of generous  Beaufort    For he the fatal Expedition led  To which I owe this long Captivity  To which I owe a twelve Years mortal Woe  Confin'd by barbarous Iroquois to  Angie    Which may just Heav'n by sharpest Plagues revenge  Okim  You curse the Victors Heav'n has curst the vanquish'd  Sak  Now they are Conquerors I'll hate them more  Okim  Think that our Conquest to your Son we owe  Then curse us if you can  Sak  Therefore the barbarous Iroquois I curse  Okim  Upon your Son's account you ought to bless us  Think on our Bounties heap'd upon his Head  Sak  Think on the Trophies by his Valour won  With which tenfold your Bounty he repays  Okim  'Tis to our Favour that he owes his Glory  Which tho' he scarce has reach'd his twentieth Year  Surpasses that of all our ancient Warriours  Sak  'Tis by his Glory you exist but he  To Fortune and himself his Glory owes  And the Instructions of the generous  Beaufort  Okim  Leading our Forces he acquir'd his Fame  Sak  Yes against the Hurons  Our Obligations there indeed are great  For causing him to turn his fatal Sword  Upon the bleeding Bowels of his Country  And its Confederate Friends the Warlike French  Who for strong Reasons ought to be most dear to him  Okim  Poorly your partial Mind affects the French  While he detests the false perfidious Race  And threatens to extirpate all those gay  But rank and filthy Weeds from  Canada    Which lately crept usurping thro' the Corn  T'oppress the genuine and the noble Seed  Sak  Tho know'st him not he's ignorant of himself  And both are blind alike but one Day Fate  Will dissipate th' impenetrable Cloud  That now obscures his Sight and then too late  His fond and fatal Error he'll detest  Okim  But why  For he who does his Duty first must know it  Sak  But this he knows at present that the French  Are strictly to his Countrymen ally'd  Okim  He owns no Country but Iroquian  Angie    Who to the French must prove eternal Foes  Sak  Time will instruct him better  Okim  Yes for our  Angie  will become to morrow  His Country by a stricter dearer tie  Sak  What meanest thou  Okim  A Tie that will for ever fix him ours  Sak  Explain thy self  Okim  To morrow's Sun will see that Beauty his  For whom the loveliest of our Indian Swains  Have sigh'd and sigh'd in vain  Sak  Thou mean'st the blooming Daughter of  Zephario    Head of th' Iroquian Tribes  Okim  Who can be meant but blest  Irene  whom  Divided  Canada  consents to adore  And they who come from distant Climes admire  The Adoration of two Worlds the English  To whom uncommon Beauty is familiar  Astonish'd gaze at her amazing Form  As at a Wonder never seen before  Sak  Yes the brave  Beaufort  too admires  Irene    And to her lays an equal Claim with  Ulamar    And for that Reason thou art wrong inform'd  For  Angie  dares not disoblige the English  Okim  But when the rival Friends went out to Battel  Thus said the wise  Zephario    Ye matchless Friends thou  Beaufort  and thou  Ulamar    Ye great and fair Supports of Liberty  And  Canada  against a faithless Race  Who have perfidiously surpriz'd our Angians  And in full Peace with Sword and Fire attack'd them  Lead forth our Arms against the perjur'd Foe  And know that he who for the common Cause  Against that Foe performs the noblest Deeds  At his return shall call  Irene  his  The Father said the charming Daughter blush'd  And to the just Decree the Friends consented  Sak  My  Ulamar  is not return'd from fight  How can that Diff'rence be determin'd then  Okim  By the Relation of impartial  Beaufort    By which he owns that your unequall'd Son  By his wise Conduct and his brave Example  Sav'd both his English and our Iroquois  Sak  That was the Modesty of generous  Beaufort    But when he own'd this was  Irene  present  Okim  Yes and in spight of all her shy Demureness  Joy lighten'd on a sudden from her Eyes  Which strugling she supprest and blushing frown'd  Or I'm mistaken or she loves your  Ulamar  Sak  Confusion  Okim  Come she is worthy of the first of Men  Sak  'Tis true so fair a Creature I ne'er saw  Ev'n I whom pow'rful Reasons force to hate her  Ev'n I with Pleasure gaze upon her Face  And viewing grow insensibly her Friend  But may she perish e'er she weds my  Ulamar    Nay may they perish both  Okim  To both you're cruel  Sak  No for if once their Hands are join'd he's lost  To me and to the best of Fathers lost  Who lov'd him as the Darling of his Soul  And to restore him to whose tender Arms  I have endur'd to live thus long a Slave  Okim  But see the noble  Beaufort  comes to attend you  SCENE II  Sakia Okima Beaufort  Sak  You're welcome worthy  Beaufort  Okim  They who bring Victory are always welcome  Sak  Had he been vanquish'd he had been more welcome  Is  Ulamar  arriv'd  Beauf  Each Minute he's expected  Sak  Well you have conquer'd then  Beauf  Yes impartial Heav'n has heard our just Appeal  And has supported Innocence and Faith  Against Injustice Treason Violence  Against Oppression Perjury and Fraud  And all the Crimes of the perfidious French  Sak  They needs must conquer for whom Heav'n declares  In spight of all the Valour of their Foes  Beauf  Madam their Valour much you over rate  They know themselves and to themselves are just  While they are false to all the World beside  They feel themselves too guilty to be brave  'Tis a shrewd Sign their Valour they mistrust  Who still on Treason or on Odds depend  But against Odds and Treasons both we conquer'd  Such Force deriv'd we from the just Disdain  That Honour Innocence and heavenly Truth  Should yield to Falshood and to Hellborn Crimes  That Thought alone sustain'd our sinking Troops  That Thought inflam'd them in extreme Distress  When one of them cried suddenly aloud  Lifting his wounded wearied Arms to Heav'n  Thou Maker of the World to whom we bow  If it be Thou and not blind Chance that governs  To thee we appeal here manifest thy Justice  Okim  Now by that Pow'r thou hast set my Soul on Fire  What follow'd  Beauf  Not the last Trumpet that must rowse the dead  To them more sudden Vigour shall convey  Than did to ours that animating Voice  All thought that Heav'n declar'd it self aloud  Strange Sights were seen and wondrous Sounds were heard  'Tis said a Flame descended upon  Ulamar    And round his Temples spread its lambent Glory  But this is sure his Deeds were more than Human  And Conquest lightning in his Eyes and Thundring in his Arm  Rows'd all our Vigour in our fainting Troops  And struck a fatal Damp upon the Foe  Sak  Beaufort  thou art too partial to thy Friend  Beauf  I am not partial I am barely just  Sak  He who is so magnanimously just  Must have done greater Wonders of his own  Do Justice to thy self then  Beauf  What I perform'd I did not in the dark  But Earth and conscious Heav'n were both Spectators  I therefore need not speak  Sak  Remember the Reward  Think on  Irene  Beauf  She's always in my Thoughts  Sak  And do you love her  Beauf  Have I my sight To see her is to love her  Sak  And can you poorly quit her to another  Beauf  No nor would I basely win her  Sak  Yet you exalt your Rival to the Skies  Beauf  That Rival is your Son and is my Friend  And still is partial when he mentions me  Sak  Think of what Love requires  Beauf  There is a Duty due to Friendship too  A thousand Lovers worship fair  Irene    But who but I has such a Friend as  Ulamar  Sak  The greatest Friendship you can shew my Son  Is to deprive him of this fatal Beauty  I had rather see him in the Arms of Death  Than of  Zephario  's Daughter  Beauf  But he had rather die than not possess her  Sak  Then let him die no let him live ye Pow'rs  But let him live without her  You love  Irene  tell me would you win her  Beauf  I would by Heav'n but would not loose my  Ulamar  Sak  Then let us jointly urge him to desist  Beauf  On what Pretence  Sak  On that of Gratitude  The strongest in the World to a brave Spirit  Can he be said to bear a grateful Mind  Who strives against his Benefactor's Bliss  Remind him of his Obligations  Beauf  What Obligations  Sak  He well remembers them tho' you forget  Too generous  Beaufort  Who snatch'd the Dagger from his Infant Breast  In that accursed Hour that made us Captives  When only we of all the Slaves were sav'd  Who forc'd the Iroquois to give us Liberty  At least a shew of Liberty  Who since instructed him in glorious Arms  Instructed him in European Arts  To whose dear Friendship is his Glory owing  His noble Acts and his accomplish'd Greatness  Tell him aloud he owes all this to  Beaufort  Beauf  Why should I tell him this  Sak  To urge him  By the remembrance of these mighty Benefits  To quit his fond Pretensions to  Irene    And not impeach his Happiness to whom  Whate'er he has whate'r he is he owes  Beauf  He owes his Greatness to himself alone  And carries an Instructor in his Breast  Beyond what all the World can e'er supply  For  Ulamar  seems sent express from Heav'n  To civilize this rugged Indian Clime  But grant to me alone he ow'd his Greatness  How base how barb'rous would it be to upbraid him  Besides all this how vain for know your Sons  No vulgar Passion is that force acquires  By just Degrees and kindles into Flame  His the first moment blasted him like Lightning  That falls from Heav'n when  Jove  with his own Fire  That Tree that's sacred to himself consumes  Sak  I but too well remember it  Beauf  Immediately he had recourse to me  Who saw and therefore lov'd  Irene  first  Then Sorrow streaming from his humid Eyes  That sparkled with Desire my Friend says he  I come to take my leave for I must die  Since only Death can make me just to  Beaufort    For only his cold Hand can quench the Flame  That is injurious to my Friend to whom  The best of Mothers and my self I owe  And then I love said he with faltring Tongue  And with a Heart about to break with Grief  I love  Irene  and for  Beaufort  die  Sak  And how receiv'd you this  Beauf  With some Surprise but yet with firm Resolve  In height of Friendship not to be surpass'd  But rather chuse to hazard her than lose  So faithful and so brave a Friend as  Ulamar  Sak  O noble Friendship Unexampl'd Rivalship  Were all thy Countrymen like thee brave  Beaufort    The Sun himself in all his shining Round  Since first his Progress from the East began  Would ne'er have seen a greater nobler People  But still my Soul from this disastrous Love  Forebodes much Mischief  SCENE III  Sak Okim Beauf  Messengers    Shouts  Beauf  What Shouts of Joy are these  Mess  Just now victorious  Ulamar  's arriv'd  And with these Shouts the joyful Angians welcome him  Beauf  Kind Heav'n be prais'd  Mess  Within an hour the Angians meet in Council  Mean while your Friend attends you at your House  Sak  O Heav'ns my Son refuses then to see me  Mess  The French by Ambassadors now proffer Peace  Concerning which he would confer with you  Before the Council meets  Beauf  Tell him I come  SCENE IV  Sak Okim Beaufort  Beauf  This proffer'd Peace shall be refus'd with Scorn  If I have any Credit with the Angians  They proffer Peace  Their frontless European Insolence  When Heav'n against their Perjuries declares  And halting Vengeance like a Bloodhound slow  But stanch o'ertakes them with his deep mouth'd Cry  Confounds their Treasure and their Troops consumes  First they sing Songs of Triumph for their Losses  And then forsooth they give the World a Peace  Oh 'tis a blessed Peace that binds our Hands  And leaves theirs loose whom neither plighted Faith  Nor Vows nor solemn'st Oaths could e'er restrain  Strong Bonds if Bonds perfidious Men could tie  Sak  Beaufort  To you I now a Suppliant come  T'a thousand Obligations add one more  Which if you grant me not the rest are vain  Beauf  But name it and 'tis yours  Sak  Provide that I may with my Son confer  Before the Council meet who will I know decide this famous Rivalship  Beauf  That Madam shall be my immediate Care  SCENE V  Sakia Okima  Sak  Ah  Okima  I sink I die with Grief  On this Important now depends my all  For should my  Ulamar  obstruct this Peace  And obstinately should espouse  Irene    Then name a Wretch that's so accurst as I  Okim  Come you provoke th' indulgent Powers to leave you  And lose your Sons Advantage and your own  For both you'll in this happy Marriage find  Sak  Once more thou know'st him not nor he himself  For hitherto within this wretched Breast  From all the World I've kept th' important Mystery  But now my Spirit groans beneath its Load  And I would ease my overburthen'd Soul  Okim  Discharge it then upon this faithful Breast  Sak  But first by that eternal Spirit swear  Swear by that awful that allseeing Mind  That conscious is alone to the dread Secret  To let no Time nor Art nor Force  Extort it from thy Mind  Okim  By that eternal conscious Pow'r I swear  Sak  Know then my Son who thinks himself a Huron  And whom too thou believ'st of Indian Birth  No Huron is nor of Canadian Kind  Know he descended of a Christian Sire  Young valiant beautiful of noble Race  Okim  A Christian you amaze me of what Nation  Sak  Consult my Passions and let those inform thee  Okim  What say'st thou Then by Nation he is French  Sak  French is his Nation  Miramont  his Name  Okim  Why is this Secret from your Son conceal'd  Sak  Let Time and Fate reveal it to him  Okim  Why not his Mother  Sak  I dare not  Okim  What should deter you  Sak  Know that my Guardian Spirit in my Dreams  Has more than once with fearful Threats forbid me  Besides th' important Secret should I tell  Before my Son has seen and known his Father  So deadly is his Hatred to the French  The which together with his Years grew up  It might a criminal Aversion cause  To him who gave him Being and besides  All hopes of Peace it surely would destroy  For that upon his Sentiment depends  But he who  Angie  to the World prefers  Will do his utmost to obstruct a Peace  That needs must tear him from this cursed Clime  He'll know that Peace will soon divnlge his Birth  And knows the Angians never will endure  To have a Frenchman lead their Troops to Battel  Besides should  Ulamar  this Secret hear  Before he sees and knows his noble Father  It might produce an impious Thought of me  Okim  This is but one of those fantastick Fears  To which long Melancholly makes you subject  For why should it produce that impious Thought  Sak  In secret  Miramont  and I were match'd  And thrice three Years in Bonds clandestine liv'd  In secret too I brought forth  Ulamar    And for three Years in private was he nurst  And five I bred him with me as my Slave  By  Miramont  presented to my Father  And then your Angians made us real Captives  When first my Husband's Hands and mine were join'd  No Soul was conscious to my plighted Troth  But Heav'n and  Miramont  and the poor Priest  That kindly tied th' indissoluble Bond  Should  Miramont  avert it Heav'n be gone  To that strange Land where Souls departed dwell  What Thoughts might such a Tale produce in  Ulamar  Okim  The Priest who join'd you might attest your Marriage  Sak  Long since alas that faithful Friend is dead  Okim  But why that tedious nine Years Mystery  Sak  Know that my  Miramont  of noble Race  Was yet a younger Brother of his House  And therefore he depended on his King  Now with that King those haughty Priests have Pow'r  Who stile themselves Companions of their God  And they unless I would embrace their Faith  Forbad all Nuptial League 'twixt me and  Miramont    Upon the penance of his King's Displeasure  Okim  When you were taken where was  Miramont  Sak  He then was in a distant Fort besieg'd  Which for his Monarch bravely he maintain'd  Okim  Have you ne'er since had Tidings of him  Sak  Ah there thou prob'st me to the very Heart  I since have never never heard of him  Okim  Perhaps by Fortune of that War he fell  Sak  Should I believe thee my sad Heart would break  And I dear  Miramont  once more should join thee  But the great Mind is merciful and good  And may have Comfort yet for poor  Sakia  That I from  Miramont  have never heard  Proceeds from the vast Tract of Land between us  Or want of Commerce 'twixt the French and you  Or from th' unusual Names your Nation gave us  When first they brought us mourful Slaves to  Angie    For I whom th'  Angians  now  Sakia  call  Nikaia  was thro' all th' Huronian Land  And  Ulamar  young  Miramont  was there  Okim  But should he live you three can never meet  For as this Secret to the World divulg'd  Ruins your Son with these five Warlike Nations  So 'twill disgrace your Husband with the French  Their Priests offended would incense their King  Sak  My  Okima  know things are alter'd much▪  For by long Conferences here with  Beaufort    My Son and I both strongly are inclin'd  T'embrace the Christian Faith  Okim  Ye Pow'rs who ever in so short a time  Display'd such various Wonders  Yet  Miramont  by strong Presumptions dead  And 'tis your Safety to promote this Match  Sab  What with my Husband's mortal Enemies  Okim  The dead have none Death reconciles us all  Sak  But know that once  My  Miramont  when in a dangerous State  Upon the Bed of Languishment he lay  Caus'd me to swear by all that I rever'd  Even by the sacred Bond that join'd our Hands  By Love the sacred Tie that join'd our Souls  And by the bright eternal Source of Love  That when my  Ulamar  arriv'd to Manhood  I ne'er would wed him to an Indian Maid  But would transport him to those happy Climes  That th' Ocean from our  Canada  divides  Besides in the dread Visions of the Night  I now for three successive Nights have seen  Miramont  threatning with a dreadful Frown  Irene  and the Lovesick  Ulamar  These Dreams are to my Son of dire Presage  And here remind me e'er it be too late  To run and tear him from impending Fate  ACT II SCENE I  Sakia Beaufort  Sak  WHen meets the Council  Beauf  Already they're assembled  And now dispose of mine and your Son's Fate  The beautiful  Irene    And in an hour here we expect  Zephario    Who must impart their final Resolution to us  Sak  Have they debated yet of Peace and War  Beauf  That the Angian Council have referr'd to me  And to your Son and to the wise  Zephario  Sak  When will my Son vouchsafe to hear his Mother  Beauf  See where he comes to attend you  SCENE II  Sakia Ulamar  Ulam  My Mother  Sak  My Son  Oh may the Bounty of th' eternal Mind  Show'r down his choicest Blessings on my  Ulamar  Ulam  Oh may he but prolong the present Blessing  That I may iong behold the best of Mothers  Sak  And yet you could desert this Mother  Ulamar    And could resist her absolute Commands  And all her soft Entreaties could despise  And I behold thee here in spight of both  All dismal with the pretious Blood of Hurons  And their Allies Heav'n knows alas whose Blood  Why would'st thou thus against my softest Pray'rs  Do an unnatural Deed that thus should pierce  The tender Bowels of the Wretch that bore thee  Ulam  And how could I avoid it how resist  Th' Almighty Voice of God and the great Call  Of Nature urging me to repel Force  By Force and to defend my self and you  Sak  O name not me for me thou hast undone  Ulam  And how could I resist my Country's Call  That awful Call that in extreme Distress  Aloud implor'd my Aid  Sak  Thy Country Ah thou fought'st against it  Ulamar    And hast embru'd thy Hands in its dear Blood  Ulam  My Hands are nobly painted with the Blood  Of Hurons and of French its mortal Foes  Sak  And canst thou then so utterly forget  That thou wert born upon th' Huronian Lake  Ulam  No but I know that I am an Angian now  My Hand my Heart my Soul are Angians all  Sak  And has a twelve Years Bondage so estrang'd thee  That thou esteem'st thy Countrymen thy Foes  O Weakness to be pitied or despis'd  Ulam  For ever blest be that eternal Pow'r  That gave me a human comprehensive Soul  That can look down upon all narrow Principles  For every brave Man's Country is the Universe  His Countrymen Mankind but chiefly those  Who wish the Happiness of all the rest  And who are Friends to all their Fellow Creatures  And such are all the brave Iroquian Tribes  Such are th' unconquer'd English free themselves  And loving all who actually are free  And all who sadly sigh for Liberty  But hating Tyrants and their Slaves alike  And equally contemning both as fall'n  Below the Dignity of Human Nature  Sak  Tyrants are odious Slaves are to be pitied  Our own sad Fate has told us so  Ulam  To me all Slaves are odious as their Tyrants  I mean all Slaves who are the Tools of Tyrants  They are true Slaves who have the Souls of Slaves  And worse than Beasts make use of their own Hands  To clinch the Chains which first their Masters tied  Such tame and wretched things are all your Hurons  No Countrymen for me who here disown them  Such are those Pests of Human Race the French  Damn'd to eternal Slavery themselves  And therefore would like Devils damn Mankind  Sak  The Hurons thou disown'st disown them still  But know amongst them are thy dear Relations  Whom God and Nature charges thee to cherish  How canst thou tell that in the late fought Field  Thou didst not meet thy Father in thy Foe  Yes how canst thou be sure thou didst not lift  Thy impious Head against his sacred Life  And stabbing me in him in whom I live  Act in one blow a double paracide  Ulam  When e'er I cease to hearken to the Dictates  Of the World's Ruler and his Servant Nature  I shall deserve to be a thing accurst  In the late Fight that I might spare my Kindred  I shun'd your Hurons and attack'd the French  And urging thro' their troops my glorious Way  I made a slaughter of their bravest Chiefs  Which they will long with bitter Woe remember  Sak  Ha have a care thou sayest Mankind's thy Kindred  Among the French too thou might'st find Relations  Ulam  'Tis true we were created Brothers all  And all descend from one eternal Sire  But whom the Father for his Sons disowns  I  not for my Brethren no the Brave  And Just are only Brethren worthy me  And such I shall respect where e'er I find them  Sak  And canst thou fondly think there are no such  Among the Squadrons of the warlike French  Ulam  I know there are  When first in the late Fight with my good Sword  I carried Death among the Faithless French  One of their foremost Leaders I observ'd  Who mow'd our Iroquois like ripen'd Corn  Extending them in Ranks along the Plain  With him went all his Souldiers Hearts and Eyes  And long live  Miramont  aloud they cry'd  Sak  Ha  Miramont  Ah Gods  Apart  speak that again  Ulam  Yes long live  Miramont  aloud they cry'd  Sak  Speak on  Apart  tho' something dire is on thy Tongue  Ulam  In short that Frenchman shew'd himself so brave  That he appear'd a Conquest worthy me  Sak  By Heav'n the very dismal thing I fear'd  Apart  Ulam  With Indignation stung I on him flew  And in my first Attack was so successful  That from his wounded Arm his Weapon dropt  Sak  What will become of the forlorn  Sakia  Apart  Ulam  Then with Revenge inflam'd I on him rush'd  And my good Sword presenting to his Heart  Sak  O Heav'n and Earth O Nature canst thou bear it  Apart  Ulam  Die die said I perfidious Villain die  Sak  O  Miramont  thou Darling of my Soul  Would I had never heard of thee again  Apart  O wretched Father and O cursed Son  Ulam  Madam you tremble and a deadly Pale  O'erspreads your Face what strange Disorder's this  Sak  I'm always on the wrack when Blood is spilt  Ulam  Then now be calm for here no Blood was spilt  Sak  How's that indeed is't possible just Heav'n  Ulam  Madam 'tis certain  For looking sternly in the Frenchman's Face  While Fate stood threatning on my lifted Arm  Thro' his undaunted Eyes I saw his Soul  So great so awful and so truly noble  That I rever'd the Sight and check'd my Hand  And gave him Liberty the Salt of Life  And sent him to his own and now you see  I can acknowledge Virtue in a Foe  And can respect it and reward it too  Sak  Ha what a turn of wondrous Fate is here  And how shall I conceal my impetuous Joy  Miramont  lives my Soul's Desire is near me  Apart  And Happiness begins to dawn from Heav'n  He lives and Love and I shall meet again  Oh unexpected ravishing return  To Bliss too swift and mighty to be born  'Twas but last moment that I felt Despair  The very worst of ills and now I hope  Ay now I entertain the charming Hope  Of holding him of whom my Soul is fond  Of holding him in these desiring Arms  And I shall see O I shall die with Joy  Yes I shall see my Love my Life again  O let me see him Gods and let me die  Ulam  Madam your Looks discover great Disorder  She hears me not nor sees me now her Eyes  Seem deeply fix'd upon some absent object  And now they wildly rowl  What mean these Musings and these sudden Starts  And these Convulsions that thus shake her Soul  Heav'n long preserve my Mother Madam hear me  Some body comes retire before they appproach  And be not seen in this extreme Disorder  Leads her out and returns  SCENE III  Ulamar Beaufort  Beauf  My  Ulamar  Ulam  My Friend  Ha thou look'st sad whenever thou art griev'd  Alas I find 'tis I my self that suffer  What Thought disturbs my Friend  Beauf  Thy sympathizing Grief disturbs thy Friend  But when I think of losing thee oh then  Ulam  That loss would quickly be repair'd for thou  Who mad'st me what I am can'st make another  And form him fit for Friendship and for thee  Beauf  'Twas Heav'n alone could make thee what thou art  A Jewel of inestimable Price  I added to thy Lustre not thy Worth  And the small Pains I took to make thee shine  Makes thee more pretious in my joyful Eyes  But when I think of losing thee  Ulam  I will not think of losing thee  I cannot bear the Thought  Beauf  Whose must  Irene  be  Ulam  Heav'n only knows  But will alas in one half Hour declare  Beauf  Whose is her Heart for thou hast oft enquir'd  Ulam  But never yet could find  Beauf  To me she still has too respectful been  And much too cold and too indifferent  Ulam  And too uneasie and reserv'd to me  Beauf  Perhaps some happier Man among the Crow'd  Of her Adorers while we sigh in vain  Possesses all her Soul 'tis hard to think  That she whose Beauty captivates all Hearts  Should be like Virtue with her self content  And never know desire  Try her once more at this important Juncture  For I have search'd into her Heart in vain  'Tis true my Soul is of her Beauty fond  As ev'n of Glory with whose noble fire  It twenty Years succesfully has burn'd  Yet I who see my fortieth Sun renew'd  Will entertain no Passion that revolts  From Reasons sovereign and eternal Law  'Tis true I would for who would not be blest  But will not by her Misery be blest  Ulam  Nor I by Heav'n  Beauf  But now let me conjure thee  Ulamar    Ev'n by that charming Hope that makes us languish  By holy Friendship's venerable Bond  That now confines us in this strict Embrace  By the Remembrance of those happy Hours  Which we have past exciting one another  To elevated Thoughts and glorious Deeds  For whomsoever Fate reserves  Irene    Oh let him not be blest by halves  Let him not lose his Friend  May never any Coldness come till Death  Between our Loves and us  Ulam  Not Death himself Unless he quite extinguishes my Mind  Shall make me cold to  Beaufort  Beauf  But our Fate comes and I must disappear  SCENE IV  Ulamar Irene  Iren  Was not that  Beaufort  why does he avoid us  What makes him look so sad  Ulam  By Heav'n she seems concern'd for him  Apart  Thrice happy  Beaufort  Whose Sorrow ev'n in absence has the force  To move your Soul while I before your Eyes  Unpitied can despair  Iren  Ah you mistake me  Ulamar  Oh that I had the Pow'r as I have the Will  To bring soft Peace to ev'ry troubled Breast  Ulam  And 'tis that Virtue that undoes me more  'Tis not that Angel's Face nor Angel's Form  That Form surpassing all your lovely Sex  'Tis not that winning Pomp of outward Graces  Which upon you as on their Queen attend  But 'tis your mind that Captivates my Soul  Your Mind in Youth's first Bloom with ev'ry Grace  And ev'ry Virtue fraught as if that Heav'n  And Nature's self took pleasure to instruct you  Before I beheld thee my restless Soul  To something high to something great aspir'd  But what I ne'er could tell till seeing thee  And knowing thee inform'd and fix'd my ravish'd Soul  And shew'd it what with blind and restless search  Before it sought in vain yes shew'd it Virtue  Virtue it self that by great Heav'ns Command  Assumes that lovely Form t'attract Mankind  And draw them to it self  But while you captivate the gazing World  You still remain serene as if that Heav'n  Design'd you not to love but be ador'd  Appearing not to know how very warm  How sharply pointed are those fatal Eyes  Smiling you kill and know not that you strike  And we with Pleasure die  Iren  Oh fond mistaken  Ulamar  oh never more deceiv'd  Know all the Extremities of Love I feel  Ulam  You love  Iren  I am all Love I burn I die with Love  Ulam  'Tis sure for some immortal Being then  For mortal Man could ne'er conceal his Joy  Iren  Alas he knows it not no more than  Ulamar  Ulam  Let him be told it e'er it be too late  Is it for  Beaufort  I'll resign to  Beaufort    For tho' I love thee more than Life it self  Tho' 'tis impossible to live without thee  To shew thee how much I prefer thy Happiness  Before my own I will to make thee happy  I will leave thee the loveliest thing in Nature  For Death the most detestable  Iren  Beaufort  assure thy self has all my esteem  But 'tis another that has all my Heart  Ulam  O Man whose Happiness ev'n Gods might envy  My Friend and I for I for him dare answer  Will no advantage take of what the Council  And wise  Zephario  shall anon determine  But both oh Gods to him resign our Claim  Iren  Aside  O matchless Love O proof of Godlike Virtue  While he speaks this behold with what Convulsions  His struggling Passion shakes his generous Frame  With whose excess he trembles and he dies  Ulam  But oh if ever thou could'st be too blame  Thou would'st be so in this for why oh why  Hast thou so long conceal'd the fatal Secret  Iren  Because I never could 'till now declare it  Without exposing too much shameful Weakness  Therefore my raging Passion I confin'd  Which burning inward prey'd upon my Life  But from the Man I lov'd I hid it most  In this alas I sympathize with you  'Tis not my Lover's Form ensnares my Heart  Tho' his our Angian Virgins all adore  But when I saw a Youth in his first Bloom  Lead our brave Iroquois with more success  Than our most ancient and experienc'd Warriors  Perform such Wonders for his Countrey's Safety  And for the Libertys of Humankind  To which he sacrifices his Repose  And ev'n his Life and Hazards the enjoyment  Of what he loves much dearer ev'n than Life  Ulam  Oh Gods O Transport whither is she going  Iren  When I beheld all this you may be sure  Th'Almighty Mind has giv'n to me a Soul  That could not see a Lover with these Virtues  These Godlike Virtues and remain insensible  The Joy that lightens from thy humid Eyes  Informs me that thou understand'st me  Ulamar    And I design'd thou should'st but then be sure  Thy godlike Virtue which inflam'd my Heart  Has in my Breast produc'd the noble Pride  Of imitating so much Excellence  As thou hast sacrifiz'd Repose and Life  And hazarded th'enjoyment ev'n of me  Whom thou lov'st more than Life for thy dear Countrey  I tho' a Woman nobly will attempt  To emulate thy singular Example  And tho' I love nay doat to Madness doat  Tho' my Heart feels what never Tongue can utter  Yet if my Countrey once decrees me  Beauforts    For  Beaufort  I'll retrieve my Heart  And never see thee more  Ulam  Oh too accomplish'd  Beaufort  Oh my Friend  What have I lost by thy transcendent Virtue  SCENE V  Zephario Irene Ulamar Beaufort  Ulam  What has Fate determin'd  Beauf  See its Interpreter enquire of him  Ulam  Beauf  Hail to  Zephario  Zeph  Ye matchless Friends thou  Beaufort  and thou  Ulamar    Are ye determin'd fully to consent  To what the Angians here by me pronounce  Ulam  Beauf  We are  Zeph  In full Assembly then they vote you Thanks  For all the Wonders ye this Day perform'd  In the Defence of Liberty and  Canada    To thee particularly Thanks they pay  Brave Youth who by the Boldness of thy Conduct  Boldness in desperate Extreams is Wisdome  Rallying our routed Troops restor'd the Day  And nobly rais'd us from Despair to Conquest  For which the Conscience of the noble Deed  And everlasting Fame Reward the Doer  But since in the first onset of the French  That fierce Attack that carry'd all before it  Beaufort  by wondrous Friendship mov'd preserv'd  Thee  Ulamar  by our own flying Troops  As by a Torrent overborn o'erwhelm'd  Trampled by Friends surrounded by the Foe  And stood the Barrier betwixt thee and Fate  That threatned thee from Friends and Foes alike  The Council wisely have decreed that he  Who sav'd th'Heroick Youth to whom we owe  Our Conquest did with him preserve the State  And therefore have decreed him for Reward  A Trifle in it self but dear to him My Daughter  Beauf  Madam do you consent  Iren  I do  Beauf  My  Ulamar  doest thou  Ulam  Oh take her while I have Voice to say she's thine  Beauf  Oh strange Consent  Despair is in her Eyes and Death in his  Madam your Tongue consents your Soul denys  Iren  'Tis true my Soul brave  Beaufort  is another's  But soon depend upon it

to chastize it  Mean while a murmur runs among our  Angians  Which from their Prisoners they derive they say  That the late Damn'd surprise was first design'd  By a French Officer who Loves  Irene

Soul  As left me impotent of Thought or Speech  And snatch'd me so entirely from my self  That the important business was unmention'd  For which that conference was first design'd  Thou hast often said my Son that thou desirest  To know thy Father  Ul  Yet you unkindly kept him still conceal'd  Sak  Believe it Son there was a wondrous cause  But wherefore would'st thou know him  Ul  That if he leads the  Hurons  out to fight  I might in Battle shun him  Sak  Is that the only cause of thy desire  Know that in Battle shoud'st thou meet thy Father  Great Nature whispring with her Voice Divine  Would make thee stop thy eager murdring Hand  In spightof all thy sacred Thirst of Blood  Or else some Genius with no mortal tone  Would thunder in thy ears forbear 'tis He  And would'st thou only know him to avoid Him  Is that the only cause of thy desire  Thou should'st desire to know him to Embrace him  And to revere the Fountain of thy life  From which the Graces of thy manly form  And all thy boasted excellences flow  Ul  Then name him  Sak  The naming him on thee my Son depends  Yet thus far thou shal'st know thy noble Father  The best and bravest of Mankind is he  And oh he loves thee Son he loves the more  Than his own lovely Eyes He lives for thee  And me he loves with such an Air and Meen  As if some God came down to adore his Creature  Oh none can love but he Oh none can show  Such Majesty with so much sweetness joyn'd  Such tenderness with fury reconcil'd  So firm a constancy with so much flame  Such rapture with inimitable Grace  And then a Wisdom and a Tongue might
