quis fortè c  A Frenchman comes presents you with his Boy  Bows and begins"This Lad Sir is of Blois  "Observe his Shape how clean his Locks how curl'd  "My only Son I'd have him see the World  "His French is pure his Voice tooyou shall hear  "Sir he's your Slave for twenty pound a year  "Mere Wax as yet you fashion him with ease  "Your Barber Cook Upholst'rer what you please  "A perfect Genius at an OperaSong  "To say too much might do my Honour wrong  "Take him with all his Virtues on my word  "His whole Ambition was to serve a Lord  "But Sir to you with what wou'd I not part  "Tho' faith I fear 'twill break his Mother's heart  "Once and but once I caught him in a Lye  "And then unwhipp'd he had the grace to cry  "The Fault he has I fairly shall reveal  "Cou'd you o'erlook but thatit is" to steal  Ille ferat pretium c  If after this you took the graceless Lad  Cou'd you complain my Friend he prov'd so bad  Faith in such case if you should prosecute  I think Sir Godfry should decide the Suit  Who sent the Thief who stole the Cash away  And punish'd him that put it in his way  Dixi me pigrum c  Consider then and judge me in this light  I told you when I went I could not write  You said the same and are you discontent  With Laws to which you gave your own assent  Nay worse to ask for Verse at such a time  D'ye think me good for nothing but to rhime  Luculli miles c  In ANNA'S Wars a Soldier poor and old  Had dearly earn'd a little purse of Gold  Tir'd with a tedious March one luckless night  He slept poor Dog and lost it to a doit  This put the Man in such a desp'rate Mind  Between Revenge and Grief and Hunger join'd  Against the Foe himself and all Mankind  He leapt the Trenches scal'd a CastleWall  Tore down a Standard took the Fort and all  "Prodigious well" his great Commander cry'd  Gave him much Praise and some Reward beside  Next pleas'd his Excellence a Town to batter  Its Name I know not and it's no great matter  "Go on my Friend he cry'd see yonder Walls  "Advance and conquer go where Glory calls  "More Honours more Rewards attend the Brave"  Don't you remember what Reply he gave  "D'ye think me noble Gen'ral such a Sot  "Let him take Castles who has ne'er a Groat"  Romae nutriri mihi contigit c  Bred up at home full early I begun  To read in Greek the Wrath of Peleus' Son  Besides my Father taught me from a Lad  The better Art to know the good from bad  And little sure imported to remove  To hunt for Truth in  Maudlin  's learned Grove  But knottier Points we knew not half so well  Depriv'd us soon of our Paternal Cell  And certain Laws by Suff'rers thought unjust  Deny'd all Posts of Profit or of Trust  Hopes after Hopes of pious Papists fail'd  While mighty WILLIAM'S thundring Arm prevail'd  For Right Hereditary tax'd and fin'd  He stuck to Poverty with Peace of Mind  And me the Muses help'd to undergo it  Convict a Papist He and I a Poet  But thanks to  Homer  since I live and thrive  Indebted to no Prince or Peer alive  Sure I should want the Care of ten  Dr  MONROE  Physician to Bedlam Hospital  Monroes  If I would scribble rather than repose  Singula de nobis anni c  Years foll'wing Years steal something ev'ry day  At last they steal us from our selves away  In one our Frolicks one Amusements end  In one a Mistress drops in one a Friend  This subtle Thief of Life this paltry Time  What will it leave me if it snatch my Rhime  If ev'ry Wheel of that unweary'd Mill  That turn'd ten thousand Verses now stands still  Denique non omnes c  But after all what wou'd you have me do  When out of twenty I can please not two  When this Heroicks only deigns to praise  Sharp Satire that and that Pindaric lays  One likes the Pheasant's wing and one the leg  The Vulgar boil the Learned roast an Egg  Hard Task to hit the Palate of such Guests  When Oldfield loves what Darnf detests  Praeter caetera me Romaene c  But grant I may relapse for want of Grace  Again to rhime can  London  be the Place  Who there his Muse or Self or Soul attends  In Croúds and Courts Law Business Feasts and Friends  My Counsel sends to execute a Deed  A Poet begs me I will hear him read  In PalaceYard at Nine you'll find me there  At Ten for certain Sir in Bloomsb'rySquare  Before the Lords at Twelve my Cause comes on  There's a Rehearsal Sir exact at One  "Oh but a Wit can study in the Streets  "And raise his Mind above the Mob he meets"  Not quite so well however as one ought  A HackneyCoach may chance to spoil a Thought  And then a nodding Beam or Pig of Lead  God knows may hurt the very ablest Head  Have you not seen at Guildhall's narrow Pass  Two Aldermen dispute it with an Ass  And Peers give way exalted as they are  Ev'n to their own Srvnce in a Carr  Inunc versus c  Go lofty Poet and in such a Croud  Sing thy sonorous Versebut not aloud  Alas to Grotto's and to Groves we run  To Ease and Silence ev'ry Muse's Son  Blackmore  himself for any grand Effort  Would drink and doze at  Two Villages within or Miles of London  Tooting  or  Earl'sCourt  How shall I rhime in this eternal Roar  How match the Bards whom none e'er match'd before  The Man who stretch'd in Isis' calm Retreat  To Books and Study gives sev'n years compleat  See strow'd with learned dust his Nightcap on  He walks an Object new beneath the Sun  The Boys flock round him and the People stare  So stiff so mute some Statue you would swear  Stept srom its Pedestal to take the Air  And here while Town and Court and City roars  With Mobs and Duns and Soldiers at their doors  Shall I in  London  act this idle part  Composing Songs for Fools to get by heart  Frater erat Romae c  The  Temple  late two Brother Sergeants saw  Who deem'd each other Oracles of Law  With equal Talents these congenial Souls  One lull'd th'  Exchequer  and one stunn'd the  Rolls  Each had a Gravity wou'd make you split  And shook his head at  My  as a Wit  'Twas"Sir your Law"and"Sir your Eloquence"  "Yours  Cooper  's Mannerand yours  Talbot  's Sense"  Carmina compono hic elegos c  we dispose of all poetic Merit  Yours  Milton  's Genius and mine  Homer  's Spirit  Call  Tibbald Shakespear  and he'll swear the Nine  Dear  Cibber  never match'd one Ode of thine  Lord how we strut thro'  Merlin  's Cave to see  No Poets there but  Stephen  you and me  Walk with respect behind while we at ease  Weave Laurel Crowns and take what Names we please  "My dear  Tibullus"  if that will not do  "Let me be  Horace  and be  Ovid  you  "Or I'm content allow me  Dryden  's strains  "And you shall rise up  Otway  for your pains"  Multa fero ut placeam c  Much do I suffer much to keep in peace  This jealous waspish wronghead rhiming Race  And much must flatter if the Whim should bite  To seek applause by printing what I write  But let the Fit pass o'er I'm wise enough  To stop my ears to their confounded stuff  Ridentur mala qui componunt c  In vain bad Rhimers all mankind reject  They treat themselves with most profound respect  'Tis to small purpose that you hold your tongue  Each prais'd within is happy all day long  But how severely with themselves proceed  The Men who write such Verse as we can read  Their own strict Judges not a word they spare  That wants or Force or Light or Weight or Care  Howe'er unwillingly it quits its place  Nay tho' at Court perhaps it may find grace  Such they'll degrade and sometimes in its stead  In downright Charity revive the dead  Mark where a bold expressive Phrase appears  Bright thro' the rubbish of some hundred years  Command old words that long have slept to wake  Such as wise  Bacon  or brave  Raleigh  spake  Or bid the new be  English  Ages hence  For Use will father what's begot by Sense  Pour the full Tide of Eloquence along  Serenely pure and yet divinely strong  Rich with the Treasures of each foreign Tongue  Prune the luxuriant the uncouth refine  But show no mercy to an empty line  Then polish all with so much life and ease  You think 'tis Nature and a knack to please  "But Ease in writing flows from Art not Chance  "As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance"  Praetulerim scriptor delirus c  If such the Plague and pains to write by rule  Better say I be pleas'd and play the fool  Call if you will bad Rhiming a disease  It gives men happiness or leaves them ease  There liv'd  in primo Georgii  they record  A worthy Member no small Fool a Lord  Who tho' the House was up delighted sate  Heard noted answer'd as in full Debate  In all but this a man of sober Life  Fond of his Friend and civil to his Wife  Not quite a Madman tho' a Pasty fell  And much too wise to walk into a Well  Him the damn'd Doctors and his Friends immur'd  They bled they cupp'd they purg'd in short they cur'd  Whereat the Gentleman began to stare  My Friends he cry'd px take you for your care  That from a Patriot of distinguish'd note  Have bled and purg'd me to a simple  Vote  Nimirum sapere est c  Well on the whole then Prose must be my fate  Wisdom curse on it will come soon or late  There is a time when Poets will grow dull  I'll e'en leave Verses to the Boys at school  To Rules of Poetry no more confin'd  I learn to smooth and harmonize my Mind  Teach ev'ry Thought within its bounds to roll  And keep the equal Measure of the Soul  Quocirca mecum loquor haec c  Soon as I enter at my Country door  My Mind resumes the thread it dropt before  Thoughts which at HydeParkCorner I forgot  Meet and rejoin me in my pensive Grott  There all alone and Compliments apart  I ask these sober questions of my Heart  Si tibi nulla sitim c  If when the more you drink the more you crave  You tell the Doctor when the more you have  The more you want why not with equal ease  Confess as well your Folly as Disease  The Heart resolves this matter in a trice  "Men only feel the Smart but not the Vice"  Si vulnus tibi c  When golden Angels cease to cure the Evil  You give all royal Witchcraft to the Devil  When servile Chaplains cry that Birth and Place  Indue a Peer with Honour Truth and Grace  Look in that Breast most dirty  D  be fair  Say can you find out one such Lodger there  Yet still not heeding what your Heart can teach  You go to Church to hear these Flatt'rers preach  Indeed could Wealth bestow or Wit or Merit  A grain of Courage or a spark of Spirit  The wisest Man might blush I must agree  If  D ***  lov'd Sixpence more than he  Si proprium est c  If there be truth in Law and  Use  can give  A  Property  that's yours on which you live  Delightful  Abscourt  is its Fields afford  Their Fruits to you confesses you its Lord  All Hete's Hens nay Partridge sold to town  His Ven'son too a Guinea makes your own  He bought at thousands what with better wit  You purchase as you want and bit by bit  Now or long since what diff'rence will be found  You pay a Penny and he paid a Pound  Emptor Aricini quondam c  Hte himself and such largeacred Men  Lords of fat  E'sham  or of Lincoln Fen  Buy every stick of Wood that lends them heat  Buy every Pullct they afford to eat  Yet these are Wights who fondly call their own  Half that the Dev'l o'erlooks from Lincoln Town  The Laws of God as well as of the Land  Abhor a  Perpetuity  should stand  Estates have wings and hang in Fortune's pow'r  Si proprium est c  Loose on the point of ev'ry wav'ring Hour  Ready by force or of your own accord  By sale at least by death to change their Lord  Man  and  for ever  Wretch what wou'dst thou have  Heir urges Heir like Wave impelling Wave  All vast Possessions just the same the case  Whether you call them Villa Park or Chace  Alas my BATHURST what will they avail  Join  Cotswold  Hills to  Saperton  's fair Dale  Let rising Granaries and Temples here  There mingled Farms and Pyramids appear  Link Towns to Towns with Avenues of Oak  Enclose whole Downs in Walls 'tis all a joke  Inexorable Death shall level all  And Trees and Stones and Farms and Farmer fall  Gemmas marmor ebur c  Gold Silver Iv'ry Vases sculptur'd high  Paint Marble Gems and Robes of  Persian  Dye  There are who have notand thank Heav'n there are  Who if they have not think not worth their care  Cur alter fratrum cessare c  Talk what you will of Taste my Friend you'll find  Two of a Face as soon as of a Mind  Why of two Brothers rich and restless one  Ploughs burns manures and toils from Sun to Sun  The other slights for Women Sports and Wines  All  Townshend  's Turnips and all  Grovenor  's Mines  Why one like  Bu  with Pay and Scorn content  Bows and votes on in Court and Parliament  One driv'n by strong Benevolence of Soul  Shall fly like  Oglethorp  from Pole to Pole  Is known alone to that Directing Pow'r  Who forms the Genius in the natal Hour  That God of Nature who within us still  Inclines our Action not constrains our Will  Various of Temper as of Face or Frame  Each Individual His great End the same  Utar ex modico c  Yes Sir how small soever be my heap  A part I will enjoy as well as keep  My Heir may sigh and think it want of Grace  A man so poor wou'd live without a  Place  But sure no Statute in his favour says  How free or frugal I shall pass my days  I who at some times spend at others spare  Divided between Carelesness and Care  'Tis one thing madly to disperse my store  Another not to heed to treasure more  Glad like a Boy to snatch the first good day  And pleas'd if sordid Want be far away  Ego utrum Nave ferar magna an parva ferar unus idem  What is't to me a Passenger God wot  Whether my Vessel be firstrate or not  The Ship it self may make a better figure  But I that sail am neither less nor bigger  I neither strut with ev'ry fav'ring breath  Nor strive with all the Tempest in my teeth  In Pow'r Wit Figure Virtue Fortune plac'd  Behind the foremost and before the last  Non es avarus c  "But why all this of Av'rice I have none"  I wish you joy Sir of a Tyrant gone  But does no other lord it at this hour  As wild and mad the Avarice of Pow'r  Does neither Rage inflame nor Fear appall  Not the black Fear of Death that saddens all  With Terrors round can Reason hold her throne  Despise the known nor tremble at th' unknown  Survey both Worlds intrepid and entire  In spight of Witches Devils Dreams and Fire  Pleas'd to look forward pleas'd to look behind  And count each Birthday with a grateful mind  Has Life no sourness drawn so near its end  Can'st thou endure a Foe forgive a Friend  Has Age but melted the rough parts away  As Winterfruits grow mild e'er they decay  Or will you think my Friend your business done  When of a hundred thorns you pull out one  Vivere si rectè nescis c  Learn to live well or fairly make your Will  You've play'd and lov'd and eat and drank your fill  Walk sober off before a sprightlier Age  Comes titt'ring on and thoves you from the stage  Leave such to trifle with more grace and ease  Whom Folly pleases and whose Follies please  FINIS
