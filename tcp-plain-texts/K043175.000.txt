 THE ORPHAN OF CHINA A TRAGEDY As it is perform'd at the THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  Nuncia fama ruit matrisque allabitur aures  Evolat infelix et faemineo ululatu  Scissa comam muros amens atque agmina cursu  Prima petit non illa virum non illa Pericli  Telorumque memor caelum dehinc questibus implet  VIRG  LONDON Printed for P VAILLANT opposite Southamptonstreet in the Strand MDCCLIX  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOHN Earl of BUTE GROOM of the STOLE TO HIS Royal Highness the Prince of WALES  MY LORD  THE generous concern you were pleased to express for the anxieties of a young Author then wholly unknown to your Lordship and trembling for his first attempt towards  the gravest moralest and most  profitable of all poems  as Milton calls a Tragedy was the distinguishing mark of a mind truly great and endued with those fine feelings which are the ornaments of even greatness itself To this your innate partiality for every endeavour in the polite arts I must ascribe it that the following scenes met with an early approbation from your Lordship an approbation that was at once the author's pride and his strongest assurance of success  The Public have indeed very far outgone my most sanguine hopes in their reception of this piece but now my Lord  The Orphan  has another severe trial to go through he must adventure into the world unassisted by the advantages of representation he must enter your Lordship's closet and there stand the examination of the most accurate criticism  In Meti descendat judicis aures  This cannot but be an alarming circumstance to a writer fully conscious of his own inability who has not been able entirely to please even his own taste who despairs of satisfying others of a more exalted  relish in the arts and therefore craves at your Lordship's hands that protection to his industry which he is aware cannot be granted to his merit  I have the honour to remain with the truest respect and most grateful acknowlegement  My Lord  Your Lordship's Most obliged and most devoted humble servant ARTHUR MURPHY  Lincoln's Inn  April    PROLOGUE  By WILLIAM WHITEHEAD  Esq  POETLAUREAT Spoken by Mr HOLLAND  ENOUGH of Greece and Rome Th' exhausted store  Of either nation now can charm no more  Ev'n adventitious helps in vain we try  Our triumphs languish in the public eye  And grave processions musically slow  Here pass unheededas a Lord Mayor's shew  On eagle wings the poet of tonight  Soars for fresh virtues to the source of light  To China's eastern realms and boldly bears  Confucius' morals to Britannia's ears  Accept th' imported boon as ecchoing Greece  Receiv'd from wand'ring chiefs her golden fleece  Nor only richer by the spoils become  But praise th' advent'rous youth who brings them home  One dubious character we own he draws  A patriot zealous in a monarch's cause  Nice is the task the varying hand to guide  And teach the blending colours to divide  Where rainbowlike th' encroaching tints invade  Each other's bounds and mingle light with shade  If then assiduous to obtain his end  You find too far the subject's zeal extend  If undistinguish'd loyalty prevails  Where nature shrinks and strong affection fails  On China's tenets charge the fond mistake  And spare his error for his Virtue's sake  From nobler motives our allegiance springs  For Britain knows no Right Divine in Kings  From freedom's choice that boasted right arose  And thro' each' line from freedom's choice it flows  Justice with Mercy join'd the throne maintains  And in his People's  HEARTS OUR MONARCH  reigns  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs YATES  THRO' five long acts I've wore my sighing face  Confin'd by critic laws to time and place  Yet that once done I ramble as I please  Cry  London Hoy  and whisk o'er land and seas  Ladies excuse my dress'tis true Chinese  Thus quit of husband death and tragic strain  Let us enjoy our dear small talk again  How cou'd this hard successful hope to prove  So many heroesand not one in love  No suitor here to talk of flames that thrill  To say the civil thing"Your eyes so kill"  No ravisher to force usto our will  You've seen their eastern virtues patriot passions  And now for something of their taste and fashions  O Lord that's charmingcries my Lady Fidget  I long to know itDo the creatures visit  Dear Mrs Yates do tell usWell how is it  First as to beautySet your hearts at rest  They're all broad foreheads and pigs eyes at best  And then they lead such strange such formal lives  A little more at home than English wives  Lest the poor things shou'd roam and prove untrue  They all are crippled in the tiney shoe  A hopeful scheme to keep a wife from madding  We pinch our feet and yet are ever gadding  Then they've no cards no routs ne'er take their fling  And pinmoney is an unheardof thing  Then how d'ye think they writeYou'll ne'er divine  From top to bottom down in one strait line  Mimicks  We ladies when our flames we cannot smother  Write lettersfrom one corner to another  Mimicks  One mode there is in which both climes agree  I scarce can tell'Mongst friends then let it be  The creatures love to cheat as well as we  But bless my wits I've quite forgot the bard  A civil soulBy me he sends this card  "Presents respects  to ev'ry lady here  "Hopes for the honor  of a single tear"  The critics then will throw their dirt in vain  One drop from you will wash out ev'ry stain  Acquaints you  now the man is past his fright  He holds his routand here he keeps his night  Assures you all a welcome kind and hearty  The ladies shall play crownsand there's the shilling party  Points to the upper gallery  Dramatis Personae  TIMURKAN Emperor of the Tartars  Mr HAVARD  OCTAR a Tartar General  Mr BRANSBY  ZAMTI a Mandarine  Mr

MIRVAN  MANDANE  _NO never Mirvan neverstill this heart  Must throb with ceaseless woeAllgracious heav'n  Will not this palace drench'd in gore the crown  Of China's kings fix'd on the Tartar's brow  Will not a tract of twenty years in bondage  Ah will not these suffice without fresh cause  Of bitter anguish in Mandane's breast  MIRVAN  Better suppress these unavailing tears  This fruitless flood of grief  MANDANE  It will not be  Ev'n mid'st the horrors of this dismal hour  When fate has all transferr'd from lost Cathai  To vile barbarian handsin such an hour  This heart revolting from the public cause  Bleeds from a private source bleeds for the woes  That hang o'er Zamti's house  MIRVAN  Alas Mandane  Amidst the gen'ral wreck who does not feel  The keen domestic pang  MANDANE  Yes all  We all Must feel the kindredtouchdaily the cries  Of widows orphans father son and brother  In vain are sent to heav'nthe wasteful rage  Of these barbariansthese accurs'd invaders  Burns with increasing firethe thunder still  Rolls o'er our heads threatning with hideous crash  To fall at once and bury us in ruin  MIRVAN  And quickly fall it mustThe hand of heav'n  Weighs this great empire down  MANDANE  Nay tax not heav'n  Almighty justice never bares it's arm  'Gainst innocence and truth'Tis Timurkan  That fell barbarianthat insatiate waster  May curses blast the Tartarhe'tis he  Has bore down all and still his slaught'ring sword  In yonder field of death where Corea's troops  Made their last stand for liberty and China  Crimsons the land with bloodThis battle lost  Oh then farewel to allBut Mirvan say  How came the tidings  MIRVAN  From yon lofty tow'r  As my eyes straining tow'rd the distant plain  Sent forth an anxious look thro' clouds of dust  The savage bands appear'd the western sun  Gleam'd on their burnish'd helmsand soon a shout  From the glad multitude proclaim'd th'approach  Of Timurkan elated with new conquest  The tyrant comes and where his wrath will stop  Heav'n only knows  MANDANE  Oh therethere lies the thought  At which imagination starts appall'd  With horror at the sceneâ–ª her busy workings  Have colour'd to my sightthere lies the thought  That wakens all a mother's fearsalas  I tremble for my son  MIRVAN  Your sonkind heav'n  Have you not check'd his ardourwith your tears  Your soft authority restrain'd the hero  From the alarms of war  MANDANE  Alas good Mirvan  Thou little know'st his dangerbut that truth  Must never pass these lips  MIRVAN  I hope Mandane  Doubts not my honest zealfull well you know  I bear this tyrant deep and mortal hate  That under him I list and wear this garb  In hopes that some occasion may arrive  When I may strike an unexpected blow  And do my country right  MANDANE  Thy loyalty  Thy truth and honour have been ever spotless  Besides thy wrongs thy countless wrongs the wounds  He gave your injur'd family and name  MIRVAN  Alas those wounds must still lie bleeding here  Untented by the hand of timeNot all  His lenient arts his favours heap'd upon me  Shall cool the burning anguish of my soul  What he that slew my father dragg'd my sister  Blooming in years to his detested bed  Yes tyrant yesthy unextinguish'd foe  Dwells in this bosomSurely then to me  Mandane may reveal her griefsher wrongs  Will add new fuel to my hidden fires  And make them burn more fiercely  MANDANE  Urge no more  My woes must rest conceal'dyet should the tyrant  Learn from the captives of yon vanquish'd host  That China's Orphan breathes the vital air  And to himself unknown within his breast  Unconscious bears the gen'rous glowing flame  Of all the virtues of his royal line  Oh should they know that the dear youth survives  That for his righteous cause this war began  Their fury then would kindle to a blaze  Might wrap the world in flames and in the ruin  My blameless son might perish  MIRVAN  Seek not thus  To multiply the ills that hover round you  Nor from the stores of busy fancy add  New shafts to fortune's quiverZamti's care  Hath still deceiv'd suspicion's wakeful eye  And o'er the mandarine his manners pure  And sacred function have diffus'd an air  Of venerable awe which e'en can teach  These northern foes to soften into men  MANDANE  Yes Mirvan yesReligion wears a mien  In Zamti's person so severely mild  That the fierce Scythian rests upon his spear  And wonders what he feelsSuch is the charm  Of heartfelt virtue such is nature's force  That speaks abroad and in rude northern hearts  Can stamp the image of an awful God  From that source springs some hopeWretch that I am  Hope idly flutters on my trembling tongue  While melancholy brooding o'er her wrongs  Lays waste the mind with horror and despair  What noise is that  MIRVAN  Compose this storm of grief  In ev'ry sound your fancy hears the Tartar  Your husband this way bends  MANDANE  Celestial pow'rs  What lab'ring sighs heave in his breastwhat terror  Rolls in the patriot's eyehaste Mirvan

heardtell mehas fate decreed  The doom of China  ZAMTI  China is no more  The eastern world is lostthis mighty empire  Falls with the universe beneath the stroke  Of savage forcefalls from its tow'ring hopes  For ever ever fall'n  MANDANE  Yet why ye pow'rs  Why should a tyrant train'd to lust and murder  A lawless ravager from savage wilds  Where chearful day ne'er dawns but low'ring heav'n  For ever rolls a turbulence of clouds  Why should a monster thus usurp the world  And trample fair simplicity from ill  Beneath his ruffian feet  ZAMTI  Far hence Mandane  Those happy days alas are fled when peace  Here nurs'd her blooming olives and shed round  Her fost'ring influenceIn vain the plan  Of sacred laws by hoary elders taught  Laws founded on the base of public weal  Gave lessons to the worldIn vain Confucius  Unlock'd his radiant stores of moral truth  In vain bright science and each tender muse  Beam'd ev'ry elegance on polish'd life  Barbarian pow'r prevailsWhate'er our sages taught  Or genius could inspire must fade away  And each fair virtue wither at the blast  Of northern domination  MANDANE  Fatal day  More fatal e'en than that which first beheld  This race accurs'd within these palace walls  Since hope that balm of wretched minds is now  Irrevocably lost  ZAMTI  Name not the day  Which saw this city sack'dfresh stream my eyes  Fresh bleeds my heart whene'er the sad idea  Comes o'er my tortur'd mindWhy cruel pow'rs  Why in that moment could not Zamti fall  MANDANE  Thy sanctity the symbol of thy God  Made ev'n the conqueror suspend his blow  And murmur soft humanityHigh heav'n  Protected thee for its own great designs  To save the royal child the newborn babe  From the dire slaughter of his ancient line  ZAMTI  Yes my Mandane in that hour of carnage  For purposes yet in the womb of time  I was reserv'dI was ordain'd to save  The infant boy the dear the precious charge  The last of all my kingsfull twenty years  I've hid him from the world and from himself  And now I swearKneel we together here  While in this dreadful pause our souls renew  Their solemn purpose  Both kneel  Thou allgracious Being  Whose tutelary care hath watch'd the fate  Of China's Orphan who hast taught his steps  The paths of safety still envelop him  In sev'n fold night till your own hour is come  Till your flow justice see the dread occasion  To rouse his soul and bid him walk abroad  Vicegerent of your pow'rand if thy servant  Or this his soft associate ere defeat  By any word or deed the great design  Then strait may all your horrible displeasure  Be launch'd upon us from your red right arm  And in one ruin dash us both together  The blasted monuments of wrath  MANDANE  That here  Mandane vows ne'er to betray his cause  Be it enroll'd in the records of heav'n  Both rise  ZAMTI  And now my heart more lightly beats methinks  With strength redoubled I can meet the shock  Of adverse fate  MANDANE  And lo the trial comes  For see where Etan mournsSee where the youth  Unknowing of the storm that gathers o'er him  Brings some new tale of woe  Enter  ETAN  ETAN  My honour'd father  And you my helpless motherah where now  Illustrious wretched pair where will ye fly  Where will your miseries now find a shelter  ZAMTI  In virtueI and this dear faithful woman  We ask no more  MANDANE  Ah quickly Etan say  What means that pallid lookwhat new event  Brings on the work of fate  ZAMTI  Say does the tyrant  Return unglutted yet with blood  ETAN  He does  Ev'n now his triumph moves within the gates  In dread barbaric pompthe iron swarms  Of Hyperboreans troop along the streets  Reeking from slaughter while from gazing crowds  Of their dire countrymen an uproar wild  Of joy ferocious thro' th' astonish'd air  Howls like a northern tempestO'er the rest  Proud in superior eminence of guilt  The tyrant rides sublimeBehind his car  The refuse of the sword a captive train  Display their honest scars and gnash their teeth  With rage and desperation  MANDANE  Cruel fate  ETAN  With these a youth distinguish'd from the rest  Proceeds in sullen marchHeroic fire  Glows in his cheek and from his flashing eye  Beams amiable horror  MANDANE  What of this youth  ZAMTI  Be not alarm'd MandaneWhat of him  ETAN  On him all eyes were fix'd with eager gaze  As if their spirits struggling to come forth  Would strain each visual nervewhile thro' the crowd  A busy murmur ranIf same say right  "Beneath that habit lurks a prince the last  "Of China's raceThe rumour spreads abroad  From man to man and all with loud acclaim  Denounce their vengeance on him  MANDANE  Ha what say'st thou Etan  Heav'ns how each black'ning hour in deeper horror  Comes charg'd with woe  ZAMTI  It cannot beYe vain  Ye groundless terrors hence

resolve  Becoming Zamti's wife  MANDANE  Yes Zamti's wife  Shall never act unworthy of her lord  Then hence I'll go and satisfy each doubt  This youthful captive raises in my heart  Quick panting with its fearsAnd O ye pow'rs  Protect my son my husband and my king  Exit  Mandane  ZAMTI  and  ETAN  ZAMTI  Come hither Etanthou perceiv'st the toils  That now incircle me  ETAN  Alas too well  I see th'impending stormBut surely sir  Should this young captive prove the royal Orphan  You'll never own th'important truth  ZAMTI  Dream not young man  To stand secure yet blooming into life  While vengeance hovers o'er your father's head  The stock once fall'n each scyon must decay  ETAN  Then let me perishwitness for me heav'n  Could Etan's fall appease the tyrant's wrath  A willing victim he would yield his life  And ask no greater boon of heav'n  ZAMTI  This zeal  So fervid in a stranger's cause  ETAN  A stranger he  My king a strangerSir you never meant it  Perhaps you would explore the fiery seeds  Of Etan's temper ever prompt to blaze  At honour's sacred namePerish the man  Who when his country calls him to defend  The rights of human kind or bravely die  Who then to glory dead can shrink aghast  And hold a council with his abject fears  ZAMTI  These tow'rings of the soul alas are vain  I know the Tartar wellshould I attempt  By any virtuous fraud to veil the truth  His lionrage again shall stalk abroad  Again shall quaff the blood of innocence  And for Zaphimri all the poor remains  Of China's matrons and her hoary fires  Her blooming virgins and her lisping babes  Shall yield their throats to the fell murd'rer's knife  And all be lost for ever  ETAN  Then at once  Proclaim him to the world each honest hand  Will grasp a sword and 'midst the circling guards  Reach the usurper's heartor should they fail  Should overwhelming bands obstruct the deed  They'll greatly dare to diebetter to die  With falling liberty than basely lead  An ignominious lifeZaphimri lost

Letter to you from an English author will carry with it the appearance of corresponding with the enemy not only as the two nations are at present involved in a difficult and important war but also because in many of your late writings you seem determined to live in a state of hostility with the British nation Whenever we come in your way  we are ferocious we are islanders we are the people whom your country has taught we fall behind other nations in point of taste and elegance of composition the same cause that has witheld from us a genius for painting and music has also deprived us of the true spirit of Tragedy and in short barbarism still prevails among us  But notwithstanding this vein of prejudice which has discoloured almost all your  fugitivepieces  there still breathes throughout your writings such a general spirit of Humanity and zeal for the Honour of the Republic of Letters that I am inclined to imagine the author of the English Orphan of China an obscure islander may still address you upon terms of amity and literary benevolence  As I have attempted a Tragedy upon a subject that has exercised your excellent talents and thus have dared to try my strength in the Bow of ULYSSES I hold myself in some fort accountable to M DeVOLTAIRE for the departure I have made from his plan and the substitution of a new fable of my own  My first propensity to this story was occasioned by the remarks of an admirable critic  Mr Hurd in his Commentary upon Horace  of our own upon the  ORPHAN OF THE HOUSE OF CHAU preserved to us by the industrious and sensible P DU HALDE which as our learned commentator observes amidst great wildness and irregularity has still some traces of resemblance to the beautiful models of antiquity In my reflections upon this piece I imagined I saw a blemish in the manner of saving the Orphan by the tame resignation of another infant in his place especially when the subject afforded so fair an opportunity of touching the strugglings of a parent on so trying an occasion It therefore occurred to me if a fable could be framed in which the Father and the two Young Men might be interwoven with probability and perspicuity and not embarrassed with all the perplexities of a riddle as you know is the case of the HERACLIUS of CORNEILLE that then many situations might arise in which some of the nearest affections of the heart might be awakened but even then I was too conscious that it must be executed by a genius very different from myself  In this state of mind sir I heard with pleasure that M De VOLTAIRE had produced at Paris his L'ORPHELIN DE LA CHINE I ardently longed for a perusal of the piece expecting that such a writer would certainly seize all the striking incidents which might naturally grow out of so pregnant a story and that he would leave no source of passion unopened I was in some sort but not wholly disappointed I saw M De VOLTAIRE rushing into the midst of things at once opening his subject in an alarming manner and after the narrative relating to GENGISKAN is over working up his first act like a poet indeed  Meum qui pectus inaniter angit Ut Magus  In the beginning of the second act he again touches the passions with a masterhand but like a rower who  has put forth all his strength and suddenly slackens his exertion I saw or imagined I saw him give way all at once the great tumult of the passions is over the interest wears away GENGISKAN talks politics the tenderness of a mother flying with all the strong impulses of nature to the relief of her child is thrown into cold unimpassioned narrative the  role pour Pamoureux  must have its place and the rough conqueror of a whole people must instantly become  Le Chevalier  GENGISKAN as errant a lover as ever sighed in the Thuilleries at Paris Your own words sir strongly expressive of that manly and sensible taste which distinguishes you throughout Europe occurred to me upon this occasion  Quelle place pour la galanterie que le parricide l'inceste qui desolent une famille la contagion qui ravage un pais Et quel exemple plus frapant du ridicule de notre theatre du pouvoir de l'habitude que Corneille d'un cÃ´tÃ© qui fait dire Ã  ThÃ©sÃ©e  Quelque ravage affreux qu'Ã©tale ici la Peste  L'absence aux vrais amans est encore plus funeste Et moi qui soixante ans apres lui viens faire parler une vielle Jocaste d'un viel amour tout cela pour complaire au goÃ»t le plus fade le plus faux qui ait jamais corrompu la literature  Indeed sir GENGISKAN in the very moment of overwhelming a whole nation usurping a crown and massacring the royal family except one infant whom he is in quest of appeared to me exactly like the amorous OEDIPUS in the midst of a destructive plague  Nunc non erat his locus  How would that noble performance that  Chef d'oeuvre  of your country the ATHALIE of RACINE have been defaced by the gallantry of an intrigue if a tyrant had been introduced to make love to the wise of the highpriest or if JOAD entertaining a secret affection for ATHALIE and being asked what orders he  would give relating to the delivery of his country should answer "aucune" none at allAnd yet this is the language of a northern conqueror whining for a mandarin's wife who has no power of resisting and having no relation to the royal family could not by an intermarriage strengthen his interest in the crown But to you sir who have told us that Love should reign a very tyrant in Tragedy or not appear there at all being unfit for the second place to you who have said that NERO should not hide himself behind a tapestry to overhear the conversation of his mistress and his rival what need I urge these remarksTo fill up the long career of a tragedy with this episodic love must certainly have been the motive that led you into this error an error I take the liberty to call it because I have observed it to be the hackneyed and stale stratagem of many modern writers Within the compass of my reading there is hardly a bad man in any play but he is in love with some very good woman the scenes that pass between them I have always remarked are found dull and unawakening by the audience even though adorned with all the graces of such composition as yours of which it is but justice to say that it bestows embellishments upon every subject  For me sir who only draw in crayons who have no resource to those lasting colours of imagination with which you set off every thing a writer such as I am sir could not presume to support that duplicity of passion which runs through your piece I could not pretend by the powers of style to suborn an audience in favour of those secondary passages from which their attention naturally revolts A plainer and more simple method lay before me I was necessitated to keep the main object as much as possible before the eye and therefore it was that I took a survey of my subject in order to catch at every thing that seemed to me to result  with order and propriety from it A scantiness of interesting business seemed to me a primary defect in the construction of the French ORPHAN OF CHINA and that I imagined had its source in the early date of your play By beginning almost "gemino ab ovo" by making the Orphan and the mandarine's son children in their cradles it appeared to me that you had stripped yourself of two characters which might be produced in an amiable light so as to engage the affections of their auditors not only for themselves but consequently for those also to whom they should stand in any degree of relation From this conduct I proposed a further advantage that of taking off the very obvious resemblance to the ANDROMACHE which now strikes every body in your plan This last remark I do not urge against accidental and distant coincidencies of sentiment diction or fable Many of the Greek plays we know had a familylikeness such as an OEDIPUS an ELECTRA an IPHIGENIA in TAURIS in AULIS a MEROPE c But what is a beauty in RACINE seems in his great successor to be a blemish In the former nothing depends on the life of ASTYANAX but what was very natural the happiness of the mother in the latter the fate of a kingdom is grafted upon the fortunes of an infant and I ask your own feelings for no body knows the human heart better Whether an audience is likely to take any considerable interest in the destiny of a babe who when your Zamti has saved him cannot produce any change any revolution in the affairs of China No sir the conquered remain in the same abject state of vassalage and the preservation of the infant king becomes therefore uninteresting and unimportant He might die sir in cutting his teeth of the hooping cough or any of the disorders attendant on that tender age whereas when the Orphan is grown up to maturity when he is a moral agent in the piece when a plan is laid for revenging  himself on the destroyers of his family it then becomes a more pressing motive in the mandarine's mind nay it is almost his duty in such a case to sacrifice even his own offspring for the good of his country In your story sir give me leave to say I do not see what end can be answered by ZAMTI'S loyalty his prospect is at least so distant that it becomes almost chimerical And therefore as history warrants an expulsion of the Tartars as it was not upon the first inroad but in process of time and experience that they learned to incorporate themselves with the conquered I had recourse to my own preconceived notions Whether I was partially attached to them or whether my reasonings upon your fable were just you sir and the public will determine  You will perceive sir in the English Orphan some occasional insertions of sentiment from your elegant performance To use the expression of the late Mr DRYDEN when he talks of BEN JOHNSON'S imitation of the ancients you  will often track me in your snow  For this I shall make no apology either to the public or you none to the public because they have applauded some strokes for which I am indebted to you and none certainly to you because you are well aware I have but followed the example of many admired writers BOILEAU CORNEILLE and RACINE with you and in England MILTON Mr ADDISON and Mr POPE It was finely said by you I have read the story and take it upon trust when it was objected to the celebrated abbÃ¨ METASTASIO as a reproach that he had frequent transfusions of thought from your writings  Ah le cher volcur il m'a bien embelli  This talent of embellishing I do not pretend to to avail myself of my reading and to improve my own productions is all I can pretend to and that I flatter myself I have done not only from you but many of the writers of antiquity If the authorities I have abovementioned were not sufficient I could add another very bright example the  example of M De VOLTAIRE whom I have often tracked to use the same expression again in the  snow of Shakespear  The snow of SHAKESPEAR is but a cold expression but perhaps it will be more agreeable to you than a word of greater energy that should convey a full idea of the astonishing powers of that great man for we islanders have remarked of late that M DeVoltaire has a particular satisfaction in descanting on the faults of the most wonderful genius that ever existed since HOMER insomuch that a very ingenious gentleman of my acquaintance tells me that whenever you treat the English bard as a drunken savage in your  avant propos  he always deems it a sure prognostic that your play is the better for him  If the great scenes of SHAKESPEAR sir if his boundless view of all nature the lawn the wilderness the blasted heath mountains and craggy rocks with thunder and lightening on their brows if these cannot strike the imagination of M De VOLTAIRE how can I expect that the studied regularity of my little shrubbery should afford him any kind of pleasure To drop the metaphor if the following tragedy does not appear to you a MONSTROUS FARCE it is all I can reasonably expect But whatever may be your opinion of it I must beg that you will not make it the criterion by which you would decide concerning the taste of the English nation or the present state of literature among us What you have humbly said of yourself in order to do honour to your nation I can assert with truth of the author of the English ORPHAN that he is one of the worst poets now in this country It is true indeed that the play has been received with uncommon applause that so elegant a writer as the author of CREUSA and THE ROMAN FATHER was my critic and my friend and that a great deal of very particular honour has been done me by many persons of the  first distinction But give me leave to say they all know the faults of the piece as well as if it had been discussed by the academy of  Belles Lettres  We are a generous nation sir and the faintest approaches to merit always meet here the warmest encouragement One thing further I will assure you in case you should discover any traces of barbarism in the style or fable That if you had been present at the representation you would have seen a theatrical splendor conducted with a  bienscance  unknown to the  scene Francoise  the performance of the two Young Men would have made you regret that they were not in your piece and though a weak state of health deprived the play of so fine an actress as Mrs CIBBER you would have beheld in MANDANE a figure that would be an ornament to any stage in Europe and you would have acknowleged that her Acting promises also to be the same moreover you would have seen a ZAMTI whose exquisite powers are capable of adding Pathos and Harmony even to our great SHAKESPEAR and have already been the chief support of some of your scenes upon the English stage  Upon the whole sir I beg you will not imagine that I have wrote this Tragedy in the fond hope of eclipsing so celebrated a writer as you are I had an humbler motive  propter amorem quod to imitari aveo  Could I do that in any distant degree it would very amply gratify the ambition of  Sir  your real admirer and most humble servant The AUTHOR of The ORPHANS of CHINA  London
