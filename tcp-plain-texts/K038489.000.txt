 THE LADY OF THE MANOR  A COMIC OPERA  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  THE LADY OF THE MANOR A COMIC OPERA AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  WRITTEN BY DR KENRICK  THE SONGS SET TO MUSIC BY MR HOOK  LONDON PRINTED FOR E AND C DILLY IN THE POULTRY J WILKIE IN ST PAUL'S CHURCHYARD T DAVIES IN GREAT RUSSELSTREET COVENTGARDEN AND J WALTER CHARINGCROSS MDCCLXXVIII  PREFACE  THE outline of the following Opera written about ten years ago by way of relaxation from severer studies was taken from the  Country Lasses  of Mr  Charles Johnson  particularly the pleasing and romantic episode borrowed from the  Custom of the Country  of  Beaumont and Fletcher  The author in accommodating his plan to the present taste was led of course to reject the revolting absurdity of supposing the custom in question still to subsist  The considerable alterations and additions also which he found it expedient to make both in the plot and dialogue have so much diversified the whole that it has been as  truly  as  illnaturedly  observed  the piece resembles a coat stolen a second time from a thief so metamorphosed that the very taylor who first cut it out would not know the handywork of his own shears  It is no wonder that in this age of  originality  so many  trulyoriginal  critics who never play at  robthief  themselves should sufficiently rally him on so artful and complete a transformation He cannot help thinking however that these  very honest  gentlemen are a little unreasonable in expecting him to do such  great things  merely for his  amusement  as are done by those who make playwriting their serious  occupation  If therefore this opera hath hitherto met with an approbation  If it afford any consolation to the professional dramatists who envy him this approbation they may rest satisfied he is by no means disposed even to amuse himself any more the same way  as general as even the best of their most elaborate productions the author cannot but impute it to the excellent acting of the theatrical performers and the elegant taste of the musical composer  THE PERSONS OF THE DRAMA  MEN  Sir Wilful Wildman  MR QUICK  Young Wildman his Nephew  MR VERNON  Sir John Manly  MR MATTOCKS  Farmer Sternold  MR WILSON  Clodden  MR DOYLE  WOMEN  Lady Lucy otherwise Flora  MRS MATTOCKS  Mrs Townly otherwise Laura  MISS BROWN  Cicely the Dairy Maid  MRS FARREL  THE LADY OF THE MANOR  ACT I  SCENE  a fertile Country A Gentleman's Seat at the top of a Hill and a Farmhouse in the Center of the Scene at the Bottom  The Scene rises and discovers Lady  Lucy  and Mrs  Townly  dressed like Country Lasses accompanied by Sheepshearers Men and Maidens dancing and singing in Chorus  HAPPY Britons while we shear  Our silver fleeces once a year  As rich tho' not so rare  If that of old  A fleece of gold  We neither know nor care  Mrs  Town  Stop stop my dear cousin Flora stop I am quite weary and can hoyden it no longer  Lady  Lucy  Come rest a while on this bank then mean time our good neighbour Clodden here will give us the new sheepshearing ballad again  Clodden  That I will fair damsel and as often as you desire it so my lungs hold good and the lads and lasses will join in the chorus  Lady  Lucy  Strike up then  CLODDEN  A wond'rous tale my friends we're told  How from some  foreign  shore  To  Grecce  of old  A fleece of gold  Advent'rous  Jason  bore  Yet murmur not my honest swains  Your  native  flocks to keep  Not less our gains  Whose peaceful plains  Are silver'd o'er with sheep  More richly doth our pains requite  The harvest of the fold  Whose fleeces white  Are chang'd at sight  By  commerce  into gold  CHORUS  repeated  Happy Britons c  Exeunt Sheepshearers singing and dancing  Lady  Lucy  So you are heartily tired of your frolick I see  Mrs  Town  Indeed I am my dear  They come forward  Lady  Lucy  And was this fatiguing amusement all the pleasure you promised yourself from this wild project of our leaving the manorhouse and passing in this disguise under the names of Flora and Laura for relations of farmer Sternold I hope you do not intend to romp about with these good folks again tomorrow  Mrs  Town  No child I was only willing to have another taste of your rural diversions before I left the country And I promise you I am fully satisfied of  their rusticity I wish I could prevail on you to accompany me to London  Lady  Lucy  What to do there  Mrs  Town  To see and converse with human creatures my dear for I cannot look upon the things that have just parted from us in any other light than as a kind of intermediate beings between men and brutes they are certainly of an inferior nature to people who live in London  Lady  Lucy  And yet in the metropolis every thing is false frivolous and artificial while  here  all things appear in the plain and unaffected dress of nature  LADY LUCY  Simplicity  daughter of  Truth  In  Modesty  's vesture array'd  Here  breathes the fond hope of the  youth  And whispers the wish of the  maid  There Artifice  son of  Deceit  In impudent foppery dress'd  With  Innocence  playing the cheat  Still makes of true passion a jest  Mrs  Town  And yet my dear Lucy people bred in society are as preferable to these clowns as angels are to mere mortalsHow long do you think to live in this wilderness before you get a husband as I did by accident  Lady  Lucy  I should hope never were I so soon to lose him again as you did by accident  Mrs  Town  Why not my dear if like mine he were as well lost as found The man dropped from the clouds to please my papa and taking pet at the world returned back againto please me  Lady  Lucy  They say indeed that marriages are made in heaven  Mrs  Town  Yes but they say too they are strangely broke in coming down  Lady  Lucy  In London perhaps where the multiplicity of objects puzzles the choice But out of the few that drop here in the country we may soon resolve to catch one and be assured my dear Townly that when the right man comes I shall not let him slip through my fingers  Mrs  Townly  Nay there's not much choice in the whole sex A man's but a man make the most of him Mine they say was one of the best of them and you see I survived his loss  Lady  Lucy  You are too young and giddy to take any thing to heart  Mrs  Town  True cousin I wore the willow only with my weeds and that not a weeping willow neither  Lady  Lucy  You are a wild rake Townly  Mrs  Town  We widows have a privilege childBut women are all rakes at heart so at least the poet says nay I'll answer for it that with all your simplicity you have your female rakes in the country as well as we in town  MRS TOWNLY  Delightful is a rural life  Where peace and plenty reign  Where faithful every man and wife  And true each nymph and swain  The plain of plains the  rural plain  Where such pure raptures flow  But may I ne'er see  town  again  If  such  a  plain  I know  Believe me false the country clown  As any London beau  The  rustic lass  like  Miss in town  Can favours too bestow  The town of towns dear  London town  Thy pleasures then be mine  Deceit  may dress in linen gown  And  Truth  in diamonds shine  Mrs  Town  To be serious my dear Lady Lucy I cannot conceive how any woman who has youth beauty and fortune at command as you have can take delight in wandering like a wild thing about the woods in gloomy groves and dismal shades when she might display her charms to so much greater advantage in the glittering circle of the Pantheon or the brilliant vistas of Vauxhall  Lady  Lucy  And I can as little conceive how any woman of sense or taste can be taken with the artificial amusements of the town when she might enjoy the pleasure of breathing the fresh air and contemplating the beauties of nature in the country  Mrs  Townly  And you do really prefer the pitiful employment of dangling after a flock of simple sheep to the superlative delight of having a flock of simple admirers dangling after youAs I live here they are  Lady  Lucy  Who What  Mrs  Town  Men men my dear social beingsSee they are coming over the stile My heart flutters at the sight of them does not yours  Lady  Lucy  Strangers and well dressed  Mrs  Town  Two of our London beaus Sir John Manly and young Wildman  Lady  Lucy  My cousin Wildman  Mrs  Town  The same my dear You don't know much of him it seems  Lady  Lucy  My uncle has ever kept him at such a distance that I have not seen him since he was a schoolboy nor do I believe Sir Wilful himself would know his nephew any more than I He has not suffered the young spark to come into his presence since his return from his travels  Mrs  Town  What can have brought them hither Let us retire behind this thicket perhaps we may learn their errand  They retire behind a thicket  Enter Sir  John Manly  and Young  Wildman  Manly  Speaking to his Servants without  Well get the carriage round to the farmhouse yonder in the bottom We'll walk across the fields and meet you  To Wild  What an unlucky accident We are not it seems above a mile or two from the manorhouse  Wild  It will be impossible however to get our damage repaired time enough to reach it tonight But no matter the news of our disaster will get there before us and my word for it when the good Baronet my uncle comes to be informed that the coach of a man of fashion hath broken down in crossing the country to pay him a visit he'll give us an opportuniof profiting by our misfortune  Manly  Be it so then I am ever for making a virtue of necessity In the mean time George you will have the pleasure of spending the night with your dearly beloved mistress  Variety  you shall sleep for once on a truss of clean straw in a farmer's barn  Wild  Well any thing for a change in life I am satisfied so we tread not continually the same track of insipid pleasures as in London where our amusements  like the company at Ranelagh move round and round for ever in a circle  WILDMAN  The  dog  in a wheel and the  horse  in a mill  The  squirrel  with bells on his cage  Thus run the same round of  mere drudgery  still  So  dull  is the taste of the age  Manly  Truce with your commonplace raillery Variety indeed is the pleasure of life but not the comfort of it I'll hold you a wager you'll not sleep so soundly in a barn as you would at a bagnio  Wild  Not the first night perhaps but custom would inure me to it  Manly  RightHabit only makes things easy and familiar This removes every inconvenience and makes us look even on danger and distress with indifference  MANLY  Luxurious lords on beds of down  Thus Care widewaking keeps  While laid on straw the labouring clown  All night profoundly sleeps  Nay blythe the seaboy reefs the sail  While howling tempests blow  And laughs to scorn amidst the gale  His wat'ry grave below  Wild  This is pretty moralizing Manly But come now we are so near our journey's end let us rightly understand each other  Manly  By all means  Wild  You agree then that if in consequence of this visit to my whimsical uncle you should approve of his niece get into her good graces and marry her  you will advance me a moiety of that lady's portion to be repaid on the death of Sir Wilful should he die intestate and in case of a will partial either to nephew or niece that we share his fortune equally between us  Manly  Exactly  Wildman  On the other hand if you should dislike or decline to pay your addresses to the lady  Manly  Never fear George as I have determined to take up and look out for a wife she will be certainly my choice I was struck when I had a sight of her once at Litchfield races and have heard such encomiums on her wit beauty and understanding since that I am half in love with her already so let us get what accommodation we can tonight and tomorrow proceed to business  Exeunt  Reenter Lady  Lucy  and Mrs  Townly  from behind the thicket  Lady  Lucy  So so these are your people bred in society these are your mortal angels  Mrs  Town  Well really they are pretty fellows  Lady  Lucy  Yes and prettily have they taken upon them to dispose of this proper person of mine without once asking leave of the right owner  Mrs  Townly  Nay child there's nothing in that People must have some way of coming together and if your cousin helps you to a good husband I think you are greatly obliged to him  Lady  Lucy  And I am greatly obliged to him for helping himself to half my fortune too am I  Mrs  Town  That indeed is a piece of impertinence  Lady  Lucy  For which if I don't make them do such penanceBut hold they return this way  Mrs  Town  Surely they won't know me in this disguise I wish I had a mask  Lady  Lucy  A mask that would be a strange sight indeed in the country No no only act up to your dress and character You made so different an appearance in London they will never recollect your features  LADY LUCY  Fine ladies with fairpainted faces in town  One mask with another may hide  Tho' less would be known  some  complexions so brown  If laid both the vizors aside  But dowdylike dress'd and bedizen'd your part  In aukward simplicity lies  The  womanoffashion's  's a creature of  art  And  nature  her surest  disguise  Mrs  Town  Enough My hands are set my eyes fixed I have a blush at command I'll bite the fingers of my cotton gloves and be as very a hoyden as ever hopped round a maypole  Reenter Sir  John Manly  and  Wildman  Manly  Well met pretty maidensThey're devilish handsome  Wild  Fine girls faithCan you tell us fair damsel  Addressing himself to Mrs  Townly  where two honest fellows can get a lodging tonight We have had the misfortune to  Mrs  Town  Fortune Sir we don't tell fortunes indeed  Affecting great aukwardness in speech and manner  Lady  Lucy  No gentlemen if you are fortunehunters you will find some of the sisterhood behind those elms We are no gypsies  Manly  Gypsies my dear I protest I am astonished to see so much beauty and elegance Your habits are rustic but they are perfectly genteel and by your air and mien you should be fine ladies from St James's  Mrs  Town  very aukwardly  Yes we have quite the St James's air indeed  Wild  Thou hast something better my little dear Those pretty pouting lips those sparkling eyes this yielding hand  Laying hold of her hand  Mrs  Town  Nay pray Sir be civilCome cousin  Wild  You would not sure leave us in a strange place child  Mrs  Town  Laud Sir we have nothing to do with you As a couple of strays indeed we might drive you to the headborough  Wild  And what then  Mrs  Town  Why then he would lodge you tonight in the pound have you cried the three next marketdays and then if nobody owned youyou would fall to the lady of the manor  Wild  The lady of the manor  Mrs  Town  Yes Sir for want of a lordMay neither of you have worse luck come cousin  Lady  Lucy  Coming forward with  Man  Ay come let us go  To  Manly  Pray Sir let go my hand  Manly  Yes child if you'll let go my heart otherwise my dear I shall not let you escape Do you know the penalty of robbing a man thus on the highway  Lady  Lucy  If you have lost any thing Sir you know your remedy It is as yet between sun and sun you may sue the county  Manly  No child I shall detain the robber and bring her to justice  Lady  Lucy  Indeed Sir you won't for I shall instantly go home  Manly  Where do you live then  Lady  Lucy  At yonder farmhouse  Manly  And who is the owner of it  Lady  Lucy  One Sternold a surly old farmer who when he's pleased vouchsafes to call me daughter  Wild  To Mrs  Townly  And do you live there too my dear  Mrs  Townly  Yes Sir we live here two country cousins fretting like silk and inkle wove together in a piece  Wild  How so  Mrs  Townly  Oh Sir She's quite a rustic and has none of the town polish one gets by going as I do to market  Curtsying with aukward affectation  Wild  Aside  Arch and silly A whimsical compound  Takes her Aside  Manly  To Lady  Lucy  And is your father really a farmer  Lady  Lucy  A gentleman farmer Sir one that having when young squandered away his estate in London took an aversion to the town and has been constantly railing against it ever since  Manly  Is he so morose a cynic think you as to refuse us entertainment for a single night  Lady  Lucy  Indeed I believe he is  Manly  Surely not if you intercede in our favour  Lady  Lucy  Perhaps not but I am not satisfied of the propriety of that I will however propose it to my father and if he approves of it you will be welcome Come cousin  Exeunt Lady  Lucy  and Mrs  Townly  Man  What a pair of pretty rustics  Wild  I never saw any thing more charming  Manly  My girl is the most angelic creature  Wild  Mine the most mortalkilling beauty  Manly  Mine the prettiest wittiest  Wild  Mine the neatest sweetesta little silly or so But no matter the more simple the more kind  WILDMAN  Give me the girl that's ripe for joy  Who not so wise as to be coy  Is amorous void of art  MANLY  Give me the lovely girl who knows  To prize the blessings she bestows  Whose head informs her heart  WILDMAN  Be thine then the joy wit and sense may inspire  And mine the fond raptures that flow from desire  MANLY  Though mine be the joy wit and sense may inspire  Be mine too the raptures that flow from desire  Exeunt  SCENE  A FarmYard  Enter  Sternold  Sternold I wish these young ladies were returned It grows late and should any accident happen to them they might pay dear for their frolickHa they have been talking to two young sparks I see there's something more in the wind than I suspected  Enter Lady  Lucy  and Mrs  Townly  Lady  Lucy  Oh farmer Sternold We have a favour to beg of you Can't you furnish lodgings for those two gentlemen yonder  Stern  Why ladies if you will not let me into your  whole project I may commit some blunder You know how apt I am to be rude to strangers  Lady  Lucy  Well well you must treat them as such notwithstanding for tho' we know them they don't know us but take us for what we seem Oblige us in giving them entertainment tonight and behave to them otherwise as you will They are within hearing so appear to them in character  Stern  Aside  Then I have my cue  Aloud  Ay some CoventGarden gentry I suppose that having been fleeced at the bagnio and cardtable are come to recruit their finances on the highway But here they can only rob the henroost What a plague sent them hither  Lady  Lucy  Bless us Sir how you talk The gentlemen will hear you  Stern  Hear me Why I would have them hear me Where are they  Lady  Lucy  By yonder hedgerow Sirthey have been waiting a good while  Stern  Let them wait with a murrain  Lady  Lucy  You will please Sir to say yes or no  Stern  No then no Burn my house and barns let the distemper seize my cows the rot my sheep the mildew my corn and the blight my fruit but let no London plagues come within my doors What has bewitch'd you to ask such a question  Lady  Lucy  They desired it of us in common humanity  Mrs  Townly  And 'twere a pity the poor gentlemen should lie all night in the fields  Stern  Gentlemen Why ye simpletons they are the bane and destruction of your sex worse enemies to beauty than old age or the smallpoxGentle indeed  STERNOLD  Not  Satan  when a wily snake  He tempted grandame  Eve  More subtle than the modern rake  Her daughters to deceive  Like  her  each curious female still  The fruit forbidden eyes  And longs to taste both  good  and  ill  For  women  will be  wise  Like  him  pursu'd the precious plan  The devil himself had laid  Doth cruel cunning  gentle  man  Seduce the silly maid  Lady  Lucy  But under your protection Sir  Stern  True daughters of the first woman Well to oblige you I'll talk to them Tell them they may come this way  Lady  Lucy  We will Sir  Mrs  Townly  See Sir they are almost here and look like sober honest gentlemen not as if they come from London  Ex Lady  Lucy  and Mrs  Townly  Stern  Now to  me  they look like a deputation from the cuckoldmakers of the corporation in commonhall assembled  Enter Sir  John Manly  and  Young Wildman  Manly  We are extremely sorry Sir  Wild  To give you this trouble  Manly  But having lost our way  Wild  And our carriage breaking down  Stern  Extremely sorry Yes you look very sorrowful indeed Lost your way Now I rather think you  are two sorry fellows that are never out of your way A pretty excuse this you have trumped up for an unseasonable visit  Manly  Sir in a few plain words  Stern  Come come I'll tell you in a few plain words what honourable design you are bent upon You clubbed your shallow wits together your carriage was to break down you were to be benightod and taking the advantage of my humanity for entrance into my house you were honestly to embrace that opportunity of ruining my family Was it not so Ask your consciences now ha  Manly  Our consciences Sir  Stern  Ourconsciences Sir Yes your consciences Sir What are you posed Have you no consciences Egad like enough Pray whence come you  Manly  From London  Stern  From London I thought so the mart of iniquity the devil's chief residence He picks up a vagabond sinner now and then with us in the country but he monopolizes with you in London  Wild  You are very severe upon the town Sir  Stern  Yes Sir I know both ends of it  Wild  Which are both greatly changed of late we assure you  WILDMAN  When you were a youngster 'tis known  The  town  was as wicked as witty  The laugh was at  court  all their own  The old standing jest still the  city  But now Sir believe me 'tis true  Of both ends the practices tally  A lord thus stockjobs like a jew  And baits bulls and bears in the Alley  In morals and manners the same  In morals and manners the same  For money or love when the trade is  The  peer  plays the  citizen  's game  And the  peeress  the gay  citylady  's  Stern  Yes yes I hear London is mightily changed indeed and if it were grown as much  better  as it is  bigger  something might be said for it But the  head  is too big for the body and the whole nation has got the rickets  Manly  I find Sir you are an universal satirist But come to the purpose I see our servants and horses are coming round Is there no security you will take for a single night  Stern  There is but it lies in my own hands gentlemen and if you dare abide by honest conditions  Manly  We wish no other Sir They who intend no wrong fear none  Stern  There lies your way then gentlemen Enter and welcome  Exeunt  Reenter Lady  Lucy  and Mrs  Townly  Lady  Lucy  He has taken them both in  Mrs  Townly  As I live so he has Now Lady Lucy if the right man should be dropped from the clouds you will be as good as your word and not let let him slip through your fingers  Lady  Lucy  I protest my heart beats strangely  Mrs  Townly  Yes child it beats to arms the town's besieged and the guard is called upon duty  MRS TOWNLY  The  heart  of a  woman  's the  fort  Where quickly the  garrison  muster  And all her proud spirits resort  When man puts her into a fluster  Yet courage my girl never fear  Discretion  's an able defender  That be the foe ever so near  Will make proper terms of surrender  But here returns your gallant to look for us I'll leave you together  Lady  Lucy  Nay but  Laying hold of her  Enter Sir  John Manly  Manly  I am come gentle maidens  Mrs  Townly  Yes Sir we see you are Good b'ye cousin  Breaks from her and runs out  Manly  Stopping Lady  Lucy  who is following her  Indeed my pretty maid I must not lose this opportunity of talking a little  seriously  to you  Lady  Lucy  Bless me Sir What can you have seriously to say to me  Manly  Say child Mere saying is too cold Let me swear to thee  Lady  Lucy  Well Sir and what would you swear to me  Manly  That I love you passionately fondly love you  Lady  Lucy  That you love me Eh And pray Sir how long may you have thus  passionately fondly  lov'd me  Manly  From the first moment I beheld you  Lady  Lucy  About half an hour or so  Manly  Yes my eyes caught instantly the infection my head grew confus'd my heart inflamed my  Lady  Lucy  Poor gentleman troubled with the amorous epilepsy Is it usual for you to fall in love thus at first sight Or is this the first fit of the kind  Manly  The first and last be assured The flame which now glows in my breast will burn for ever  Lady  Lucy  Not it Sir Be comforted It was kindled too suddenly and burns too violently to last long  LADY LUCY  Love  by  reason  uncontroul'd  Never long the same can hold  'Tis a  fever  of the  mind  Of the  intermittent  kind  Hot and cold  Like an  ague  hot and cold  Now the wretch with fury burns  Now his freezing fit returns  Fickle as the breath he draws  Now he  chills  and now he  thaws  Hot and cold  Love'  s an  ague  hot and cold  Manly  This child is mere poetry And poets you know will say any thing  Lady  Lucy  Come then Sir to converse without a metaphor  Manly  With all my heart Then I declare I think you a charming creature and never saw a woman I liked so well it my life  Lady  Lucy  At the same time you think yourself sufficiently agreeable I suppose  Manly  Why don't  you  Lady  Lucy  To be sure you are not absolutely frightful  Manly  Nay but you like me  Lady  Lucy  Don't be too confident of that You may flatter yourself as you do me  Manly  Flattery my dear is the language of love It is impossible to say what we mean when our meaning is beyond the power of words  Lady  Lucy  'Tis time then to have done Sir if you cannot speak to be understood  Manly  Or if you won't understand me To speak plainly then in what part of this rural habitation is your bedchamber  Lady  Lucy  That's pretty plain indeed  Manly  Do you sleep alone child  Lady  Lucy  No Sir with my cousin Laura But why are you so inquisitive My father sleeps not far off  Manly  No matter  MANLY  In the gentle  Laura's  stead  Take me fair one to your bed  To your arms I'll softly creep  When your  father  's fast asleep  Tell me charmer which the way  Lest I in the dark should stray  Lady  Lucy  So then it seems you really assure yourself that having sighed kissed my hand said a few foolish fine things and impudently stared me in the face I shall drop into your arms as they say birds do into the mouth of the rattlesnake by fascination  Manly  Nay my love this is all raillery Come you shall live with me and command my fortune I'll take you from this surly old man and place you in your proper sphere Make me but happy to night  Warmly  Laying hold of her hand which she coldly withdraws  Lady  Lucy  And you will leave me miserable tomorrow I thank you for the mighty favours you would confer But what would the world say  Manly  The world Child I will set you above it My whole estate shall be devoted to your pleasure and my influence exerted to protect you from insult  Lady  Lucy  No Sir Tho' you could place me beyond the reach of censure you could not raise me above the sense of shame You might protect me from the insult of reproach but could not shield me from the pangs of remorse I scorn your protection  Going  Manly  Laying hold of her hand  Nay but stay  LADY LUCY  Such cruel protectors ye  men  Who seek simple maids to decoy  As  butchers  who guard in the pen  The lambs they prefer to destroy  MANLY  Nay  men  to fond  shepherds  compare  Who watch o'er the hopes of the fold  The favourite lamb of whose care  To slaughter is not to be sold  LADY LUCY  Adieu mean seducer adieu  I fly from the falsehood of art  MANLY  In vain for I still will pursue  The charmer possessing my heart  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  The curtain rises and discovers Sir  John Manly  Young  Wildman Sternold  Lady  Lucy  Mrs  Townly  and others sitting at a table  Stern  Ay a song But let it be something in which we may all bear a part  Manly  And let the burthen be rural hospitality  Song for several voices  With friendly smile and social glee  Lo  Ruralhospitality  With hearty welcome to the best  Of ev'ry  Stranger  makes a  guest  In plenty spreads her chearful board  With what kind Nature's gifts afford  So lib'ral generous frank and free  Is  Ruralhospitality  In heaven no sooner heard her name  Than  Jove  to earth a rambler came  Philemon  's guest as well as we  Hail  Ruralhospitality  They all rise Lady  Lucy  Mrs  Townly  and the rest go out  Sir  John Manly Wildman  and  Sternold  come forward  Stern  Ay only lay aside your town manners gentlemen and we shall agree well enough  Manly  But what hath set you farmer so much against London  Stern  The insolence and impertinence of its inhabitants Prodigal as I was I could not bear to be fleeced by a set of moneymaking sharpers who differed from coiners clippers and cutpurses only in being greater criminals with greater security I could not endure the haughtiness of scoundrel upstarts who by taking advantage of the weakness or administring to the wickedness of mankind were enabled to assume the appearance of gentlemen and lolled at ease in the carriages which honester men were forced to drive  Manly  Yet thus will it ever be Sir while men are men and live in a state of society  Stern  No Sir it is because men are  not men  that such pitiful doings disgrace societyIt is because so many mean animals are ever ready to bend the knee and crawl on  four  legs that a few others stand so erect and strut about so insolently on  two  But I  STERNOLD  I never could bear in the train  Of sycophants servile to wait  Or meanly dependent in vain  To dance at the heels of the  great  The spaniel indeed that will creep  And kiss while they beat him their hand  In time on a woolsack may leap  And sit with the lords of the land  But he that by merit would rise  Will find to his cost when too late  That  meanness  not  merit  they prize  So  low  and so  little  the  great  Manly  I hope farmer your sentiments have not infected your neighbourhood If they have we are  likely to meet with but an indifferent reception from the old gentleman there on the top of the hill whom we purposed to visit  Stern  Sir Wilful Wildman Oh no He is still fond of your men in power and place your people of rank and quality forsooth  Manly  I thought him a worthy character Sir  Stern  He is so Sir Wilful has many more good qualities than the fops he so foolishly admires  Manly  He has a niece I think the toast of the country  Stern  She is Sir and very deservedly but you'll hardly have an opportunity of seeing her unless you make some stay in these parts she is at present gone a visiting somewhere with a rantipole young widow of quality that came down from London about a month ago And when they will return to the manor it seems nobody knows but themselves and perhaps they neither  Manly  That's unlucky  Stern  Yes Sir she would have been worth your seeing she has twenty thousand pound in her pocket and will in all probability succeed to the whole estate of Sir Wilful  Wild  Has the baronet no other relations then I thought he had a nephew  Stern  Yes  he  has  a  nephew  and a sad rakehelly young dog they say he is Sir Wilful never sees him and will most likely cut him off with a shilling At least I would advise him to it  Wild  Aside  I'm much obliged to you for that however  Stern  He has been sent abroad truly for improvement and improved it seems he is returned  Manly  In virtù I suppose eh  Stern  Ay if by  virtù  you mean all manner of vice The devil I think possesses the fathers and guardians  of this age to send over their sons and wards to the continent Luxury is a plant that thrives pretty well in the cold climate of our own island there is no need of transplanting it into the hotbeds of France and Italy But come gentlemen walk into the other room I'll just step out and see your servants and cattle provided for and return immediately I see the girls are coming again this way they will entertain you in the mean while  Exit  Lady  Lucy  and Mrs  Townly  crossing the stage and curtsying as they pass  Manly  To Lady  Lucy  Whither away my little charmer  Follows Lady  Lucy  out  Wild  To Mrs  Town  No no child you don't get off so easily  Runs after Mrs  Townly  and brings her back  Mrs Town  Affecting a silly aukwardness as in a former Scene  Laud Sir what would you have You men are the strangest creatures  Wild  And you women are the most provoking things Whither were you going  Offers to kiss her she breaks from him  Mrs Town  I sha'nt tell you indeed and so don't follow me  Exit  Wild  That I will for if that be not a challenge I'll never accept one  Exit  Reenter Sir  John Manly  and Lady  Lucy  Lady  Lucy  Nay Sir No more of this I beseech you I have told you my heart is not to be purchased  Manly  Not with mine my dear Come we'll make an exchange I'll give you heart for heart  Lady  Lucy  That was indeed the whole way they say Before money was in fashion they used to barter in kind  Manly  Let us then revive that honest custom of the age of love and innocence  Lady  Lucy  But have you a clear title to what you would dispose of Is not that heart of yours sold or mortgaged already  Manly  I was free as air till I beheld those eyes  Lady  Lucy  And would yet so soon exchange your freedom for servitude  Manly  If I might be your servant  Lady  Lucy  I am afraid you'll prove a worthless one  Manly  Try me and if you like me not discharge me  Lady  Lucy  That may be dangerous but come instead of taking you for a servant suppose I should like you well enough to make you master Would you marry me  Manly  Marry you Why that isasto be surebut  Lady  Lucy  Ha ha ha Confounded as I live The man so very humble as to offer me  his  service is too haughty to accept of  mine  Manly  Not that childNot at allOh no But why need we marry Why should you give me the  command  who am so ready to  obey  Lady  Lucy  It is enough Sir I am fully satisfied of the baseness of your designsTake back the vain offer of your heart and know that I scorn as much to yield to your dishonest passion as you do to submit to honourable love  Going  Manly  Detaining her  Nay but stayYou must stayLet me reflect a little  Lady  Lucy  Do Sir Think how ungrateful how injurious your solicitations You call yourself a gentleman and pretend to be ruled by the laws of truth and honour and yet you would betray the confidence reposed in your veracity you would defraud your honest host of his greatest treasure the innocence of his  daughter you would inhospitably murder my poor father the man whose house you entered under a solemn engagement that would to common robbers under the like circumstances be sacred and inviolable  Manly  Thou hast touched my soul A conscious pang shoots through my heart and covers me with shame  Lady  Lucy  I know the disparity of our fortunesI know you fear your family and name should suffer in the opinion of the world but believe me Sir they suffer more in fact when you attempt to seduce an honest mind from virtue  Manly  I own itCan you forgive me Your just reproof hath overcome my scruples I will marry thee  Lady  Lucy  Nay but think seriously Can you love me for life A poor girl without a penny of portion Take time to consider of it  LADY LUCY  Think what your companions so gay  And family friends in highlife  With insolent scoffing will say  If made humble  Flora  your wife  Though virtue in simple attire  May pleasing appear in the  clown  Great folks in the  country  admire  The merit they spurn at in  town  Manly  I  have thought  of it and would marry you were it practicable immediately No family can ensure no education improve such manners I must not cannot will not live without you My whole soul is fixed my wishes all center in you Can you deny me Give me your hand Let me be yours for ever My  whole estate shall go to purchase your consent and that shall be your wedding portion  Lady  Lucy  Well Sir on that condition and with my father's consent you may possibly obtain mine  Manly  I'll seek him and obtain his instantly But shall I then be sure of yours  Lady  Lucy  Why that isasBless me here's somebody coming  Manly  You promise then  Lady  Lucy  Promise I don't knowwellbut then I do  Manly  leads Lady  Lucy  to the door and returns  Manly  Charming creature Marry you How can I resist such wit beauty and virtue unitedBut the worldHow shall I withstand the reproach of my acquaintanceI will renounce them I can more easily sustain the taunts of a thousand sops and flirts of fashion than support a single reproof from my lovely virtuous Flora  MANLY  Then give me dear charmer your hand  The world's vain reproaches above  My freedom I yield on demand  The world were well lost for your love  Reenter  Wildman  Wild  Well said heroic Anthony But where's your Cleopatra my boy  Manly  A Cleopatra only in beauty George You come in good time I want your advice Shall I marry this charming little rustic or not  Wild  Marry her why you are not in love with her surely  Manly  Faith I believe I amI have strong symptoms of it My heart flutters at the sight of her She  is constantly in my thoughts I could fight for her die for her  Wild  Poh that a man might do for an hundred women he was never in love with To die for a woman Manly is a mere piece of gallantry But to marry her boy is to live for her a serious piece of business and perhaps with her too which isout of fashion egad and that is worse than being out of the world by half  Manly  Yet that I could bear with Florafame fortune friendship all put into the balance against her appear light as a feather My regard for her will be lasting as life  Wild  Then you must die soon Manly take my word for it However if you have a mind to put your passion to a violent death you will take the readiest way Marriage is as certain a remedy for love as an incurable mortification is for all other disorders  Manly  Don't be so severe George Her charms will afford an eternal source of pleasure  Wild  I don't believe either in the immortality of her charms or the eternity of your passion  Manly  Look at her again then and be converted  Wild  Convert thyself my friend To marry a woman merely for her beauty is to enslave your whole body for the gratification only of your eyes But why nerd you marry her Give her some gold man promise her more cheapen her purchase her carry her off as I will do the little lapwing her cousin What the devil should you encumber yourself with the lease of a house for when you may rent the best apartments in it as long as you like and leave it at pleasure  Manly  I don't believe that Had you seen with what modest reluctance she yielded even to a kiss Her maiden reserve  Wild  Modest reluctance I like that truly Maiden reserve Ha ha ha Little artful gypsey  YOUNG WILDMAN  The cunning  country wench  in  this  Like little lofty  London Miss  So shyly shuns a civil kiss  But boldly offer more  Begin to rifle once her charms  Her bosom beats with soft alarms  And kindly sinking in your arms  Her feign'd aversion's o'er  Manly  And yet I have tried every temptation to allure every argument to persuade and neither my gifts nor my promises would avail me  Wild  Poh poh you did not come up to her price I suppose That's all I thought Manly you had known women better Besides consider you are on the cruise after my cousin Lady Lucy a twenty thousand pounder Will you be diverted from the chace of such a noble prize by such a little smuggling cutter as this If the freehearted cockboat will give herself away willingly or take a reasonable price for her cargo well and good But to purchase a pretty beggar at the expence of your whole estate reputation and liberty Zounds man are you mad Come come let us have no more of this but go in and sit down to old Crusty's October  Manly  It is in vain I find to talk of virtue to a libertine Go in yourself I'll join you presently But I must speak a word or two with old Crusty as you call him before we set into drinking  Exeunt at opposite sides of the stage  SCENE an Orchard with an Arbour at the bottom in front  Mrs  Townly  comes forward out of the Arbour  MRS TOWNLY  Sure nature form'd man for a rover  Weak women design'd to deceive  His tale though told over and over  To  twenty  they  all  would believe  Nay were time or chance to discover  The falsehood so many must rue  So soothing the voice of a lover  To each he would seem to be true  Enter Lady  Lucy  Lady  Lucy  Well cousin what have you done with your gentleman  Mrs  Town  Nay what have you done with yours  Lady  Lucy  Mine is grown the most civil obsequious flatterer  Mrs  Town  Mine continues the most impudent rude rogue Do you know that I could not get rid of him without promising to meet him here after supper And yet he no sooner left me than he fell desperately in love with Cicely the dairymaid and told the poor wench more lies in five minutes than she ever heard at statute market or fair in her whole life  Lady  Lucy  It would be a good deed to put the rake to some shame  Mrs  Town  I intend it if he be not shameless I have thefore ordered Cicely to come hither and give him the meeting in my stead I have also another scheme in my head with the help of Farmer Sternhold to punish his impudence more severely if he carries it any further  Enter  Cicely  Mrs  Town  So Cicely you have made a conquest of the London gentleman it seems  Cicely  Concourse Madam Laud I don't know what your ladyship means  Mrs  Town  Madam Ladyship You know child you are not to call me Madam but Mistress Laura  Cicely  True Madam Laura I declare I did not know one word in ten the gentleman said▪ But he hugged and squeezed me so I am sure I wished 'un further  Lady  Lucy  He did not hurt you sure  Cicely  Not to speak of I could have managed 'un well enough had that been all But as he was a gentleman I was minded to let 'un alone a little Yet he was so woundy skittish had it been Robin or Richard I would have flapped the face of o'un heartily  CICELY  At romps with Robin Tom or Dick  One fearful is of danger  And rates them for the wanton trick  One pardons in a stranger  If such rough clowns should come too near  We risk the being undone  But rude may be those freedoms  here  Which civil are in  London  Lady  Lucy  And yet you must not let even Londoners be too familiar Cicely for tho' less rough they are not less rude and are the more dangerous as they are more insinuating  Cicely  Your Ladyship  Lady  Lucy  Again your Ladyship My name is Flora you know  Mrs  Town  Hush Hush Yonder goes our spark sauntering about to look for me I suppose You have your instructions Cicely so put your best foot foremost We shall be at hand to assist you if your gentleman grows rude upon encouragement  Exeunt Lady  Lucy  and  Mrs Townly  Enter  Cicely  alone  Cicely  I will Madam and as he is within earshot I'll at him first with a song  CICELY  What hopes can there be for poor  Cicely  That one who's a gentleman born  In love will not cater more nicely  And treat a plain milkmaid with scorn  Can he who was e'er sworn at  Highgate  The mistress forsake for the maid  When ah between her mien and my gait  So striking a diff'rence display'd  Can he who knows a gem to prize  And may its worth enjoy  Reject when both before his eyes  A diamond for a toy  What hopes can there be then for  Cicely  c  Enter  Wildman  Wild  What in full song my little canary bird I have been looking here all about for you this half hour  Cicely  For me or Mrs Laura Sir  Wild  Laura child No for you Did your young mistress talk of coming then  Cicely  Yes Sir She sent me to tell you she should not come  Wild  Ha ha ha I like that much Who wanted her I had rather have your company my dear Cicely by half Why do you know that I fell in love with you  Cicely  At first sight mayhap  Wild  Nay before that mayhap  Cicely  What before you saw me at all Sir What for pray  Wild  For your singing my little woodlark As I listened to the ditties you carol'd coming home from milking Cupid let fly his darts so thick at me that one came  whiz  into my right ear  Cicely  And went  whiz  out of the left I suppose  Wild  No faith it lodged in my head and in its way down to my heart left at my tongue's end a little song I once made on a namesake of yours pat to our present purpose  WILDMAN  Love  my blindfold heart to wound  Made not  sightly  charms his choice  But more artful arm'd with  sound  Avail'd him of  Cecilia  's voice  Echo  thus made  Pan  of yore  Amorous of the  vocal  wind  Sing sweet  Cicely  sing no more  Till Love be  deaf  as well as  blind  Unless my sweet Cicely you sing only for me and then you may warble sweetjug all the livelong night like a nightingale  Cicely  And will you lie so long awake to listen to me  Wild  That I will my little Philomel Do you think I had not rather listen to you than gaze upon that moppet your mistress  Laura  Cicely  Moppet Sir Laud Mrs Laura is reckoned a monstrous deal handsomer than me  Wild  She Mere curds and whey No more to be compared to you than sour butter milk is to sweet cream child Besides the silly creature is half a fool an idiot in comparison of you  Cicely  Silly Oh oh oh Why she goes in these parts for a great wit You are certainly joking with me now  CICELY  You terribly flatter I'm sorely afraid  Poor  Cicely  an ignorant innocent maid  More witty and pretty by half than myself  My betters so fair  You well may compare  To fine china ware  That stands in the cupboard or uppermost shelf  While homelier  Ciss  Like a plain earthen dish  Is coarse and as clumsy as delf  Wild  Wrong not your charms my pretty little milkskimmer I swear you look in that straw hat and short petticoat like a queen of the fairies come to take a dance on the green by moonlight  WILDMAN  Let me then to yonder bower  Only but for half an hour  With my fairyqueen retire  There unseen we'll toy and kiss  Why averse my gentle Ciss  Zounds she sets me all on fire  Wildman  endeavours to force  Cicely  towards the arbour out of which Lady  Lucy  and Mrs  Townly  burst laughing  Lady  Lucy  and Mrs  Town  Ha ha ha  They advance laughing to the front of the stage keeping  Wildman  and  Cicely  shuffling and looking confus'd still between them  Lady Lucy  Ironically to  Cicely  Gentle  fairy  Of the  dairy  Who by moonlight trip the green  Mrs TOWNLY  With your lover  Under cover  Go and toy and kiss unseen  Cicely  Pretending to be frightened  Indeed and indeed Mrs Flora indeed and indeed Mrs Laura I was not consenting nor relenting The wicked gentleman would force me into the arbour in spite of my teeth  Lady  Lucy  Affecting anger  Mighty well hussey Be ready to confront him then before your matter tomorrow morning  Mrs  Townly  For neither of you shall sleep in the house tonight I can assure you  Lady  Lucy  A pretty gentleman indeed Prefer the maid to the mistress  Mrs  Townly  A mighty pretty gentleman truly Ha ha ha  Exeunt Lady  Lucy  and Mrs  Townly  laughing  Wild  What an unlucky dog am I By beginning with the maid before I had done with the mistress I shall do nothing I suppose with either mistress or maid  CICELY  Affecting to cry  Alack must poor Ciss  For a trifle like this  Be turn'd out to the wind and the weather  Oh ho ho ho ho  Crying  WILDMAN  Ha ha ha ha ha  Laughing  No no  Cicely  no  With me you shall go  And we'll lodge in some hovel together  Come don't look so renetty my creamcheese curd If you lose your place on my account I'll get you another You shall live with me and churn butter in a dairy of your own But surely your young mistresses will not be so cruel as to lock us out of doors  Cicely  I don't know Sir They are very severe I'll go and see if you please  Wild  And so make a separate peace and leave me out of the treaty No no child If I am to stay all night in the orchard you certainly stay along with me  Cicely  Laud Sir do you think I won't come back to you again  Wild  Why will you  Cicely  For certain I will  Wild  Nay then they may do as they please But you'll return soon  Cicely  Don't be too impatient neither my young mistresses want a great deal of courting  Wild  Egad I think so but make what haste you can child the dew falls apace  Cicely  Yonder is a dry hovel Sir where you may wait till I come back But don't ramble into the yard for fear of the mastiffs  Wild  Well thought of my dear I shall lie close till you return my dear dairymaid So I don't wish you good night  Exit  Cicely  And yet the poor gentleman might as well for the nights are so short I shall hardly prevail to get him  till morning But it is moonlight and there is plenty of peasestraw in the hovel  CICELY  The sky so clear the night so sine  The watchdogs bay the moon  Then lie close London spark of mine  For fear I come not soon  Poor  Cicely  vows her heart it moves  To speak her mind so free  Then lie close thy dear dairymaid  Can come no more to thee  Exit  SCENE the Farmer's Hall  Enter Sir  John Manly  and  Sternold  Stern  Well Sir as I find your character and intentions are honourable I am satisfied I have no other objection to make than the general one against unequal and precipitate marriages I could wish your affections had been of slower growth to have taken deeper root Beauty is like a rich but shallow soil It is fertile but I always suspect its sudden shoots come up too hastily to be vigorous or lasting  Sir  John  Rather suspect the languid affection of the mercenary tribe who marry only for money  Stern  Well Sir if you are so fully determined I have nothing farther to say except that if you mean to be married this morning for you have kept us up till past midnight you must not have much sleep I can tell you You must ride some miles and that expeditiously too to procure a licence and get tacked together within canonical hours  Sir  John  Sleep Sir I promise you I shall not go to bed till I return You will be so obliging as to let my servant and one of yours get the horses ready to  attend us my lovely Flora has promised she would set out with me the moment I procured your permission  Stern  Adventurous girl Well go see after your mistress while I order the necessary preparations for your journey Heav'n grant that your love prove as lasting as it seems to be sincere Not but that a match made only for love is as likely to turn out happy as one made merely for money  Sir  John  Ay never fear farmer  Exit  Stern  Sir JOHN  The passion doubt when faintly gleams  From gold is borrow'd light  The  moon  thus sheds her watery beams  Still  cold  however  bright  True love is like the  sun  whose rays  A genial warmth impart  While beauty's warmer brighter blaze  Inflames at once the heart  Exit  SCENE  a FarmYard  Enter  Wildman  Wild  Fairly jilted by Jupiter Here have I been waiting like an ass the return of a skittish young filly till it is broad daylight By the noises that have continued all the while in the house one would imagine this outoftheway old fellow kept his family up all night or at least that like a ship's crew they kept watch and watch about If I am not revenged of the little devils for playing me this trickHa here comes my arch little simpleton alone An early riser 'faith She may chance to get a fall before night  Enter  Mrs Townly  Ha Miss Have I caught you  Lays hold of her  Mrs  Town  Sir my uncle would speak with you  Wild  Yes child and I would speak with you too What a pretty trick you countrycousins contrived to play me last night Do you think I shall tamely put up with it  Mrs  Town  Bless me Sir Have you been in the orchard all night  Affecting astonishment  Wild  No but I have been skulking in yonder hovel all night  Mrs  Town  What with Cis the dairy maid I'll warrant  Wild  No all alone I warrant But come child you shall go and satisfy yourself  Mrs  Town  Laud Sir What do you mean  Wild  Mean my dear Nothing but to let you see whether the bed be tumbled or not  Wildman  endeavours to force  Mrs Townly  off the stage  Mrs  Town  Nay then help help Uncle murder help  Enter  Sternold  with two servants who go up to Wilddisarm and seize him while  Mrs Townly  breaks from him and runs off  Stern  So so There there the game is safe What my honest guest Mr Wildman Is it you that have strolled out poaching abroad so early You are really a very modest gentleman What can you say for yourself now Ha  Wild  Say Why I say that your kinswoman here has been very uncivil to me  Stern  And you would have been as much too civil to her Hah Is it not so Come come bring him along He shall have a ducking and a fair race for it Our  horsepond Sir is something wide and not of the cleanest If you can swim across it I believe you will not make a hunting seat of my farm again in haste  Wild  Sir I am a gentleman and expect to be used accordingly Take off your two ruffians and let me speak with you alone  Stern  Well Sir I'll trust you I'll give you more credit than you deserve Do you hear  To the servants  Stay without that you may be ready within call  Exeunt servants  Now Sir what have you to say in arrest of judgment  Wild  Sir I say that I have done nothing contrary to law  Stern  Not contrary to law  Wild  Not to common law which is founded solely on custom and it has been the custom time out of mind for us young fellows whose blood flows briskly through our veins to use no ceremony with a wholesome cherrycheek'd country wench wherever we have the opportunity of a barn bed hovel or haycock  Stern  Mighty well And so you confess you would have overpowered her hah  Wild  A little agreeable violence is absolutely necessary on these occasions It saves a world of altercation and gives an edge to appetite  Stern  And so having finished this agreeable affair that is having dishonoured yourself by doing the poor girl an irreparable injury you could have reconciled your behaviour to your principles and have sat down perfectly satisfied with the probity of the action  Wild  Faith I believe I should  Stern  What can provoke you to such injustice and barbarity  Wild  Health and high spirits my dear misanthrope Look you old Wormwood I have entered into a covenant  with youth to make the most of time I have seized fast hold of his forelock and won't let him give me the slip for a moment without some enjoyment  WILDMAN  Give me then life's largest cup  Fill with pleasure fill it up  Pleasure such as love inspires  Melting joys and warm desires  Keep Oh keep it running o'er  Till grown old I thirst no more  Stern  Hoity Toity What a dissolute wretch have we got here  Wild  Come come old boy don't mistake your illnature for virtue or your crusty humour for an antipathy to vice Every cynic is not a philosopher Pr'ythee polish yourself therefore my dear rough diamond You are the sourest old fellow I think I ever met with You invite a man into your house here and then deny him the only tidbit he has a mind to  Stern  You know the conditions Sir on which you entered this house But you have broken through every social obligation and yet imagine you are still acting in the character of a gentleman  Wild  Well said father greybeard Egad I fancy you would make a good methodist preacher But as we are not likely to agree in our principles with exchange of compliments on both sides let us take leave  Stern  Stay Sir I must first have satisfaction for the insult put on my family  Wild  Oh with all my heart old ploughshare I understand you was born a gentleman So your time place and weapons in a few words  Stern  Not mine I assure you I have lived long enough to be a little wiser But the young woman you have insulted has a lover who lives in the neighbourhood  and has spirit enough to give you the meeting  Wild  Gad so Your bullies about you too I did not suspect that However I'll meet him Sir  Stern  Expect him then under the elms in the meadow behind the farm precisely at noon And alone Sir  Wild  I will not fail Sir  Stern  You dare not for fear of being posted for a coward a greater reproach to a modern fine gentleman than that of being stigmatized as a villain or even a murderer  Wild  You are right old gentleman there is nothing a man of spirit is so much afraid of as that of being thought afraid of any thing  YOUNG WILDMAN  and  STERNOLD  alternately  Right or wrong true or false good or bad be your cause  Proud  honour  with nature at strife  O'er  justice  to triumph and laugh at the  laws  You have only to venture your life  'Tis the  mode  and the world will be still so polite  Whatever the cause be of strife  To think though you're wrong that you're still in the right  If but boldly you venture your life  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE a Meadow near the FarmHouse  Enter  Wildman  Wild  A fine time of day for a cool thrust just in the heat of the sun Egad I have no appetite for it I wish it was over But where's my rival I am before my time I see  Looking at his watch  Ha Manly  Enter Sir  John Manly  Manly  George what are you doing here  Wild  Doing I have been looking about the fields for you Where the deuce have you been all this morning that I could not get a sight of you  Manly  With my charming Flora to be sure Where should I have been  Wild  Well and you have brought her to reason at last have you  Manly  I hope so  Wild  Ay ay I told you the wayMarry her indeed A fine scheme  Manly  True that's all over I may go to bed to her now if I will without asking leave of the parson  Wild  If you will And won't you What the devil have you more scruples than the girl  Manly  Why faith she is so innocent and credulous that I cannot bear the thoughts of imposing on her simplicity  Wild  Well then marry her afterwards if you like it But I may safely trust you for that you are too  good a friend to population to encourage the inclosure of commons  Manly  This spot however is neither common nor waste George and a little legal inclosure is a convenience to life when the land has been carefully cultivated  Wild  Yes yes it has been cultivated I'll warrant itBut you cannot intend to marry the wench  Manly  Indeed I did intend it in the morning  Wild  What to take the refuse of a clodhopper to your bed and share her favours perhaps with a plowman  Manly  Nay no more of this her virtues are equal to her beauty  MANLY  Though meaner far my  Flora  's lot  And I of princely line  I'd take her from her humble cot  Or make that cottage mine  From  chance  derived let  noble birth  Ideal  honours claim  In  virtue  there is  real  worth  A  title  's but a  name  Wild  Virtue Ha ha ha Yes yes it is a very virtuous family we have stumbled on here indeed I suppose I am to be bullied into marrying the niece too but  Manly  Hold Sir I have hitherto borne your reflections with temper but I must not indulge you farther  Wild  Oh Oh You are serious Are you Well come come did it want a wife It shall have a  Dutch ginger bread one gilt with Dutch gold too not worth a stiver  Manly  Pr'ythee George don't make me angry with you in earnest  Wild  Why what's the matter with you man Are you mad in earnest You are as fractious as if you were married already and had found your wife as wise as yourself  Manly  To confess the truth then I am married  Wild  Married How When Where To whom  Manly  This morning to Flora And now you know my situation Tell me as a friend your opinion of what I have done  Wild  Done Pox you have done a very silly thing tied yourself to a waxen baby a mere moppet a prating partycoloured paroquet which you will play with like a child till you are tired and then in a peevish fit be ready to wring its neck off  WILDMAN  The whining girl or whimpering boy  Papa's or mother's darling  Obtaining thus a favourite toy  By sulking or by snarling  A while he in it takes a pride  So pleasing is the gay thing  But soon the bauble thrown aside  He cries for some new plaything  Manly  Nay if that be all farewel I see you are bent on railing at every thing But if you will come and dine with us at Sir Wilful's you may possibly be converted  Wild  At my uncle's  Manly  Yes the Baronet intercepted us in our return from church and infisted on the celebration of our marriage at the manor house You'll give us your company George  Exit  Wild  Not I You have ruined our project thereBesides I have other businessMy antagonist is not very alert in keeping the farmer's appointment Perhaps this is he coming cross the fieldNo this is a mere boyI suppose my hero has sent some formal excuse the women have locked him up the country is raised or the justices have issued their warrant to stop hostile proceedings and make up the matter over a friendly bottle  Enter Mrs  Townly  in man's cloaths  Mrs  Townly  Your servant Sir  Wild  Yours Sir  Aside  Some young ensign of the militia I suppose  Mrs  Townly  I am sent hither Sir to do justice to an injured fair whom I have the honour to be well with and I suppose you are my man  Wild  And do you think yourself man enough young gentleman to support your pretensions to her  Mrs  Townly  Oh Sir I have brought a stouter man than you on his knees before now  Wild  But what interest may you have in the wench to engage you thus in her affairs  Mrs  Townly  Oh Sir I have been her favourite a good while her chief fault indeed is being a little too fond of me  MRS TOWNLY  I freely confess Sir  I dress and undress her  Alone with her quite at my ease  No mortal but I Sir  Her constant adviser  Can do with her just as I please  'Tis not so gallant to be sure to mention particulars of this nature but the affair is no secret I think this is the seventh challenge I have given or received for her and her cousin Flora The seventh No the eighth Four justices two excisemen a parson and yourself  Wild  Flora What you have had her too hah  Mrs  Townly  Excuse me there Sir she's married it seemsFaith I'm very glad on'tPoor man Your friend I mean I hope he is not apt to be jealousIf his son and heir should step into the world before the usual time he would do well to impute it rather to the forwardness of the boy than to the frailty of his wife  Wild  Thou art the most impudent braggard I ever met with  Mrs  Townly  'Tis false Sir What because I have reprieved you a little and suffered you to breathe a moment while I diverted you with my gallantries you grow insolent  Wild  Ha ha ha thou art a very potgun charged with air  Mrs  Townly  And thou a wooden blunderbuss without any charge at all  Wild  Thou most insignificant animal  Wildman  draws and advances towards Mrs  Townly  WILDMAN  Come come draw your sword Sir  Without more delay  MRS TOWNLY  Not I on my word Sir  I fight my own way

little bully  Mrs  Townly  As you make a longer lunge than I Sir it may not be prudent to engage with you at small sword But put up and take this or this  Presenting two pistols  Wildman  puts up his sword and takes one  You may change it or recharge it if you suspect my honour  Wild  How is it loaded  Mrs  Townly  With a brace of bullets Sir  Enter Farmer  Sternold  Stern  To Mrs  Townly  Aha What engaged already my little friend  To  Wildman  I told you he was a lad of spirit and would find you sport Keep your ground for he shoots flying to a miracle  Wild  Does he Egad then I am glad you are come farmer for we were just going to be very serious here This little huffbluff Hetcor will let nobody kiss your family but himself it seems Pr'ythee let us make up this affair old gentleman I own I don't fancy this flash and a pop as your young friend calls itIf I am in the wrong why  Stern  Oh Sir Nothing will satisfy him now but your blood depend on it  Mrs  Townly  Traversing the stage with her pistol cock'd  No Sir Nothing but your blood Nothing but your blood Demme  Wild  Well Sir if nothing else will do  Mrs  Townly  Come onLet us retreat each five paces then turn round on our heels and give fire together  They meet retire each five paces and then turn round  Wildman  fires and Mrs  Townly  falls as if shot  Stern  Oh he is shot he is killed my poor boy is murdered  Wild

Manly  Manly  Really Sir Wilful you give yourself too much trouble I am obliged to you but could wish to be excused  Sir  Wil  Excused No no No excuse I will have no excuse What a bridegroom and afraid of a fiddle A tenant's daughter married and not have a dance  Manly  Well Sir if it must be so  Sir  Wil  And so it is that graceless young rogue my nephew you have brought with you into the country eh  Manly  Yes Sir Wilful and I could wish I might be the means of restoring him to your favour  Sir  Wil  Restore him SirHe never lost my favour He never had it He forfeited all pretensions to that before he was born  Manly  How Sir Before he was born  Sir  Wil  My brother you must know mortally offended me by his extravagance so that though I consented to be the boy's guardian for the sake of his mother I shall never be reconciled to him on the account of his father  Manly  That resolve does not square with your reported generosity Sir Wilful The son may not inherit the foibles of his father  Sir  Wil  Yes yes prodigality runs in the blood as well as other fashionable disorders he has made away with his whole patrimony already and might starve but for the annuity I allow him out of regard to the honour of our family  Manly  Young men Sir Wilful are apt to be too liberal By keeping good company he has fallen into bad hands  Sir  Wil  Why give the rogue his due he has kept good company as you say Who but George Wildman at Boodle's the thatched house the St James's and andevery where else egad where he might spend or lose his money To be sure he is the worse for good company And yet if the young rascal had my estate tomorrow he'd run headlong into better and ruin himself for ever  Manly  It is unhappily too true Sir The first men in the kingdom are liable to be stript by sharpers  Sir  Wil  Yes but George is not sharp enough to strip me He would be the first man in the kingdom I know to do it but I shall be the last man to let him No no let him play at sharps with those that have taught him the game  SIR WILFUL WILDMAN  The youth of the age are so prodigal grown  So profligate thoughtless and idle  That all my estate should I lend him on loan  At Newmarket races  At Bath and such places  My money and lands would go after his own  No no let him bite on the bridle  Our  family mansion  which  Time  still regards  In mould'ring would totter and sidle  Our  oaks  that once shelter'd old  Druids  and  Bards  At  Almack's  and  Arthur's  Amongst stars and garters  To earth would be fell'd by a cut of the cards  No no let him bite on the bridle  Manly  But Sir Wilful  Sir  Wil  No entreating Sir John It is only waste of breath It will be to no purpose Here has been a pretty lady from London this month past interceding for him If she can do any thing with him well and good otherwise I am inexorable Not but that he shall have all when I die I'll not give sixpence out of the familyBut not a farthing more than his allowance while I live But I shall survive the rogue he'll certainly come to be hanged I have heard such things of him he'll certainly come to be hanged  Enter a Servant  Serv  The coach is returned Sir with the ladies  Sir  Wil  Gadso ay shew them up  Manly  Ladies Sir Wilful  Sir  Wil  Only a neighbour or two just to make up a party for a country dance after dinner  Sir  Wilful  goes to the door to introduce the Ladies    Manl  Aside  This queer old Baronet is so troublesome with his civility I find I must go through the impertinence of a public wedding after all  Enter Lady  Lucy  elegantly dressed  Sir  Wil  Leading Lady  Lucy  forward  Sir John Manly  Manly  So I must salute them too it seems  He goes to salute Lady  Lucy  and starts back  My love my dear Is it you Why this change of dress Wherefore thus metamorphosed  Lady  Lucy  I hope my features are not alter'd with my clothes  Manly  No my love but you can receive no addition by dress that will not injure the simplicity of your charms  MANLY  Can shreds of sattin silk or lace  By mode or taste combin'd  Bestow one beauty in the face  One virtue on the mind  Then  Flora  wherefore stoop so low  To have recourse to art  Your charms require not dress nor shew  To captivate the heart  Sir  Wil  All this is very true Sir John But hereby hangs a tale It was formerly an odd custom for the Lord of this Manor  Manly  Why are not you he  Sir  Wil  Not I Sir no no The present Lord is a relation of mine by marriage I thought you had known him but you'll know him presently  Manly  Well Sir and what of him  Sir  Wil  Being a humorist and a man of pleasure he lately took it into his head to revive the obsolete custom I was going to tell you of by promising a handsome marriage portion to a tenant's daughter on condition of her indulging him in the privilege of a husband on her weddingnight  Many  And she has found a man I supppse that will marry her on such conditions  Sir  Wil  Our peasantry Sir John are few of them so nice as to let honour stand in the way of profit  Manly  But what is all this to us Sir  Sir  Wil  True Sir John that is as you take it but the point is your spouse is the damsel on whom my kinsman has promised to bestow his bounty and as he is ready to fulfil his part of the agreement he thinks he has a right to insist on the performance of covenants on the part of the bride  Manly  Ha ha ha I see you are disposed to be merry with me Sir Wilful  Sir  Wil  Gadso but I am very serious Sir John The maiden never dreaming it would be her lot to meet with a husband who should object to the condition of the obligation thought there was no harm in thus providing herself with something to begin the world with But if you refuse your consent to be sure the landlord must forego his claim  Manly  Consent Confound his claim and his covenant too I'll shoot him through the head for having the insolence to mention it  Lady  Lucy  And me through the heart at the same time Sir  Manly  Madam  Lady  Lucy  Since all must come out Sir it is in vain to deny that I love this landlord  Manly  Love him Sir Wilful's kinsman the lord of the manor  Lady  Lucy  The same Sir  LADY LUCY  Let  lord  and  husband  have his due  I yield to each his part  For when I gave my  hand  to you  I gave to  him  my  heart  While  your  commands I then obey  And prove a loving  wife  O'er  him  Oh let me bear the sway  A  mistress lov'd  for life  Manly  Mighty loving indeed I thank you for your love Madam But what can you see in me so absurd as to attempt thus to impose upon me  Lady  Lucy  Take care you don't impose on yourself Sir  Manly  'Sdeath Madam who is this landlord Let me see him What's his name Where is he  Lady  Lucy  If you can command your passion Sir you may find yourself alone with him in the adjoining gallery and be satisfied of his claim  Manly  Yes yes Madam he shall give me satisfaction depend on it  Exit  Sir  Wil  'Egad his blood circulates purely What a confounded flurry he is in  Lady  Lucy  I begin to pity him Sir he suffers too much from an imaginary evil Let us follow him  Exeunt  SCENE Another Apartment in the Manorhouse  Enter Sir  John Manly  in great agitation  Manly  Confusion What can I make of all this  Looking anxiously about  I see nobody  Enter Mrs  Townly  in man's cloaths  Manly  Ah ha here he comes  Aside  Mrs  Town  Aside  So far so good Now if I can but steal undiscovered to her dressingroom  Walks on tiptoe across the stage    Manly  Coming forward and stopping her  Yes Sir but you don't steal undiscovered to her dressingroom I assure you 'Sdeath

better reason  Manly  Dost thou talk of reason too thou contemptible little animal  Mrs  Town  Yes faith do I And I think it very hard for a man who has just fallen in one duel to be taken up so soon by a second  Manly  Do you laugh at me Sir  Advancing  Mrs  Town  Hold hold Sir I tell you I have been shot once today already You would not go to kill me again  Manly  Insolent trifler Defend yourself this moment or by heavens  Puts himself in a posture of defence  Mrs  Town  Nay then it is well I secured my firearms  Aside    MRS TOWNLY  The man is stark mad without doubt  And  this  for my safety expedient  Presents a pistol to  Manly  who retires    To the right if you pleaseWheel about  'Tis well SirSoThereYour obedient  Crosses the stage and exit    Manet  Manly  with his sword drawn in great confusion  Sir  Wilful  and  Lady  Lucy enter at folding doors that open in the centre of the scene  Sir  Wil  Ha ha ha What fencing with the air man Fighting with your own shadow  Manly  It is well Sir that your age and house protect you As for you Madam I have learned to despise you since I have seen the thing on which you had placed your affections  Lady  Lucy  What thing Sir  Manly  That toy of silk and tinsel that went out just now Bullies should be made of more substantial stuff But thank Heaven our marriage is not consummated nor ever shall I'll sue out a divorce or ride post to Japan but I'll get rid of this affair  Sir  Wil  to  Lady  Lucy  Codso We shall carry this joke too far here the man's brain is turned in good earnest  To  Manly  Why Sir John there was nobody here but in your own imagination  Manly  Away thou egregious old coxcomb  Putting up his sword and going    LADY LUCY  Oh stay Ah turn my only dear  The sportive trial's too severe  It pains me thus to grieve you  Leave not in rage your faithful bride  But lay your fears and frowns aside  And let her undeceive you  Manly  'Sdeath Madam What do you mean  Lady  Lucy  I mean Sir that you yourself are the favourite landlord in question It is you who gave me the promise of your whole fortune for my weddingportion It is you to whom I have given both my hand and heart  Sir  Wil  It is

Sir John what say you now Shall the marriage be consummated or not Shall the landlord have his due or will you shoot him through the head Sue out a divorce or ride post to Japan to get rid of this affair Hah  Manly  I am dumb with admiration  Lady  Lucy  I was resolved Sir never to venture on a husband till I was convinced that my person rarather than my fortune was his aim That proof you have generously given me and I am rejoiced that I can make you this grateful return You must impute the artifices I have used in procuring this assurance to the design concerted between you and your friend for the disposal of both my person and fortune without my consent  Manly  I own it with blushes I own it How shall I repay thy generosity Give me thy hand thy lips thy heart there let me dwell and be for ever happy  Embraces her    Sir  Wil  There there so so All's compos'd again Egad I was afraid you were non compos when you talked of meeting a bully here  Manly  By heavens I encountered an
