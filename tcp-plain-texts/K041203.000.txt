 ADVERTISEMENT  COULD some gentlemen of approved ability have been prevailed upon to do justice to the subject of the following Ode the present apology would have been unnecessarybut as it was requisite to produce something of this kind upon the occasion and the lot having unluckily fallen on the person perhaps the least qualified to succeed in the attempt it is hoped the candour of the public will esteem the performance rather as an act of duty than vanity in the author  As some newspaper writers have illiberally endeavoured to shake the poetic character of our immortal bard too deeply indeed rooted in the heart to be affected by them it is recommended to those who are not sufficiently established in their dramatic faith to peruse a work lately published called  An Essay on the Writings and Genius of  SHAKESPEARE by which they will with much satisfaction be convinced that  England  may justly boast the honour of producing the greatest dramatic poet in the world  To strengthen and justify the general admiration of this astonishing Genius it has been thought proper to subjoin to the Ode some undeniable Testimonies both in prose and verse of his unequalled original talents  If it shall be found that  speaking  that part of the Ode which has usually been conveyed in recitative produces a better effect the Author flatters himself he may lay claim to some little merit on that account As to the Ode itself he presents it to the public as an object of their goodnatureto his friends as an exercise of their partialityto his enemies as a lucky opportunity of venting their wit humour criticism spleen or whatever else they please should they think it worthy of their notice  N B  In page line by mistake in some of the copies the line that should be  Now

which rules the skies  Could not bid other nations rise  To glut his yet unsated sword  But when our SHAKSPEARE's matchless pen  Like  Alexander  's sword had done with men  He heav'd no sigh he made no moan  Not limited to human kind  He fir'd his wonderteeming mind  Rais'd other worlds and beings of his own  AIR  When Nature smiling hail'd his birth  To him unbounded pow'r was given  The

HIS page  Nor see that Art as well as Nature strove  To place HIM foremost in th'  Aonian  grove  For there there only where the Sisters meet  His Genius triumphs and the work's complete  WHITEHEAD  Poet Laureat  Though there are many many more poets who have spoken of  SHAKESPEARE  with equal praise and admiration yet these which first occurred were thought sufficientLest any of our readers should think with a certain gentleman who upon hearing  Milton  's verses in praise of  SHAKESPEARE  said He never regarded what was said in poetrythat the very nature of it was fiction and had no value without itthere is added some undeniable testimonies in prose of  SHAKESPEARE  's unparalleled genius  SHAKESPEARE was a man who of all modern and perhaps ancient poets had the largest and most comprehensive soul All the images of Nature were still present to him and he drew them not labouriously but luckily when he describes any thing you more than see it you feel it too Those who accuse him to have wanted learning give him the greater commendation he was naturally learned he needed not the spectacles of books to read Nature he looked inwards and found her there I cannot say he is every where alike where he so I should do him injury to compare him with the greatest of mankind But he is always great where some great occasion is presented to him No man can say he ever had a fit subject for his wit and did not then raise himself as high above the rest of poets  Quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi  DRYDEN  Among the  English  SHAKESPEARE has incomparably excelled all others That noble extravagance of fancy which he had in so great perfection thoroughly qualified him to touch this weak superstitious part of his reader's imagination and made him capable of succeeding when he had nothing to support him besides  the strength of his own genius There is something so wild and yet so solemn in the speeches of his ghosts fairies witches and the like imaginary persons that we cannot forbear thinking them natural though we have no rule by which to judge of them and must confess if there are such beings in the world it looks highly probable they should talk and act as he has represented them  Our inimitable SHAKSPEARE is a stumblingblock to the whole tribe of these rigid criticks who would not rather read one of his plays when there is not a single rule of the stage observed than any production of a modern critic where there is not one of them violated SHAKESPEARE was indeed born with all the seeds of poetry and may be compared to the stone of  Pyrrhus  's ring which as  Pliny  tells us had the figure of Apollo and the nine muses in the viens of it produced by the spontaneous hand of Nature without any help from art  ADDISON  But certainly the greatness of this Author's genius does no where so much appear as where he gives his imagination an entire loose and raises his fancy to a flight above mankind and the limits of the visible world  ROWE  If ever any author deserved the name of an original it was SHAKESPEARE Homer himself drew not his art so immediately from the fountains of Nature it proceeded through Egyptian stainers and channels and came to him not without some tincture of the learning or some cast of the models of those before him The poetry of SHAKESPEARE was inspiration indeed he is not so much an imitator as an instrument of Nature and it is not so just to say that he speaks from her as that she speaks through him  His characters are so much Nature herself that it is a sort of injury to call them by so distant a name as copies of her Those of other poets have a constant resemblance which shews that they received them from one another and were but multipliers of the same image each picture like a mock rainbow is but the reflection of a reflection But every single character in SHAKESPEARE is as much an individual as those in life itself it is as impossible to find any two alike and such as from their relation or affinity in any respect appear most to be twins will upon comparison be found remarkably distinct To this life and variety of character we must add the wonderful preservation of it which is such throughout his plays that had all the speeches been printed without the very names of the persons I believe one might have applied them with certainty to every speaker  The power over our passions was never possessed in a more eminent degree or displayed in so different instances Yet all along there is seen no labour no pains to raise them no preparation to guide our guess to the effect or to be perceived to lead toward it but the heart swells and the tears burst out just at the proper places we are surprized the moment we weep and yet upon reflection find the passion so just that we should be surprized if we had not wept and wept at that very moment  How astonishing is it again that the passions directly opposite to these Laughter and Spleen are no less at his command That he is not more a master of the great than of the ridiculous in human nature of our noblest tendernesses than of our vainest foibles of our strongest emotions than of our idlest sensations  Nor does he only excel in the passions in the coolness of reflection and reasoning he is full as admirable His sentiments are not only in general the most pertinent and judicious upon every subject but by a talent very peculiar something between penetration  and felicity he hits upon that particular point on which the bent of each argument turns or the force of each moment depends This is perfectly amazing from a man of no education or experience in those great and public scenes of life which are usually the subject of his thoughts so that he seems to have known the world by intuition to have looked through human nature at one glance and to be the only author that gives ground for a very new opinion That the philosopher and even the man of the world may be born as well as the poet  POPE  SHAKESPEARE created as it were the  English  theatre that he boasted a strong fruitful genius that he was natural and sublime that his scenes are beautiful and noble though sometimes dreadful that his passages are strong and forcible and atone sor all his faults and that his dramatic pieces dart such resplendant flashes as amaze and astonish  VOLTAIRE's Letters concerning the  English  Nation  In how many points of light must we be obliged to gaze at this great poet In how many branches of excellence to consider and admire him Whether we view him on the side of art or nature he ought equally to engage our attention whether we respect the force and greatness of his genius the extent of his knowledge and reading the power and address with which he throws out and applies either Nature or Learning there is ample scope both for our wonder and pleasure If his diction and the cloathing of his thoughts attract us how much more must we be charmed with the richness and variety of his images and ideas If his images and ideas steal into our souls and strike upon our fancy how much are they improved in price when we come to reflect with what propriety and justness they are applied to character If we  look into his characters and how they are furnished and proportioned to the employment he cuts out for them how are we taken up with the mastery of his portraits What draughts of Nature What variety of originals and how differing from each other How are they dressed from the stores of his own luxurious imagination without being the apes of mode or borrowing from any foreign wardrobe  THEOBALD  Since therefore other nations have taken care to dignify the works of their most celebrated poets with the fairest impressions beautified with the ornaments of sculpture well may our SHAKESPEARE be thought to deserve no less consideration and as a fresh acknowledgment hath lately been paid to his merit and a high regard to his name and memory by erecting his statue at a public expence so it it is desired that this new edition of his works which has cost some attention and care may be looked upon as another small monument designed and dedicated to his honour  HANMER  WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE whose excellent Genius opened to him the whole heart of man all the mines of Fancy all the stores of nature and gave him power beyond all other writers to move astonish and delight mankind  Lord LYTTELTON  Of all the literary exercitations of speculative man whether designed for the use or entertainment of the world there are none of so much importance or what are more of our immediate concern than those which let us into the knowledge of our nature Others may exercise the reason or amuse the imagination but these only can improve the heart and form the human mind to wisdom Now in this science our SHAKESPEARE is confessed to occupy the foremost  place whether we consider the amazing sagacity with which he investigates every hidden spring and wheel of human action or his happy manner of communicating this knowledge in the just and lively paintings which he has given us of all our passions appetites and pursuits  WARBURTON  I shall not attempt any laboured encomiums on SHAKESPEARE or endeavour to set forth his perfections at a time when such universal and just applause is paid him He himself tells us  To gild refined gold or paint the lily  To throw a perfume on the violet  To smooth the ice or add another hue  Unto the rainbow or with taperlight  To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish  Is wasteful and ridiculous excess  And wasteful and ridiculous indeed it would be to say any thing in his praise when presenting the world with such a collection of beauties as perhaps is no where to be met with and I may very safely affirm cannot be paralleled from the productions of any other single author ancient or modern  DODD  If such another poet could arise should I very vehemently reproach him that his first act passed at  Venice  and his next at  Cyprus  Such violations of rules merely passive becomes the comprehensive Genius of SHAKESPEARE and such censures are suitable to the minute and slender criticism of Voltaire  Non usque adeo permiscuit imis  Longus summa dies ut non si voce Metelli  Serventur leges malint a Caesare telli  This therefore is the praise of SHAKESPEARE that his drama is the mirrour of life that he who has mazed his imagination in following the phantoms which other writers raise up before him may here be cured of his delirious extasies by reading human sentiments in human language by scenes from which a hermit may estimate the transactions of the world and a confessor predict the progress of the passions  JOHNSON  My design amounted to no more than a desire to encourage others to think of preserving the oldest editions of the  English  writers which are growing scarcer every day and to afford the world all the assistance or pleasure it can receive from the most authentic copies extant of its NOBLEST POET  STEVENS  It is said of the ostrich that she drops her egg at random to be disposed of as chance pleases either brought to maturity by the sun's kindly warmth or else crushed by beasts and the feet of passengers such at least is the account which naturalists has given us of this extraordinary bird and admitting it for a truth she is in this a fit emblem of almost every great genius they conceive and produce with ease those noble issues of human understanding but incubation the dull work of putting them correctly upon paper and afterwards publishig is a task they cannot away with If the original state of all such author's writings even from  Homer  downward could be inquired into and known they would yield proof in abundance of the justness of what is here asserted but the author now before us shall suffice for them all being at once the greatest instance of genius in producing noble things and of negligence in providing for them afterwards  CAPEL  There was a time when the art of Johnson was set above the divinest raptures of SHAKESPEARE The present age is well convinced of the mistake And now the Genius of SHAKESPEARE is idolized in its turn Happily for the public taste it can scarcely be too much so  HURD  SHAKESPEARE is a kind of established religion in poetry and his bays will always flourish with undiminished verdure When I say this I am not for maintaining that he is not guilty of transgressions but for every transgression he recompences his auditors with beauties which no art will ever equal That the notes established by  Aristotle  and  Horace  are agreeable to nature I am ready to allow and that inferior geniuses may avail themselves by a skilful conformity to them I as freely assent to But fable is but a secondary beauty the exhibition of character and the excitement of the passions justly claim the precedence in dramatic poetry It is in writing as in gardening where nature does not afford spontaneous beauties recourse must be had to the establishments of slow and endeavouring art to the regularity of uniform vistas the intricacy of elaborate mazes and a studied insertion of evergreens but when the course of the country of itself presents attractive scenes on every side when the trees branch out with a free expansion and the bold prospect surprizes with the heath the lawn the hill and valley in wild variety the littleness of tedious culture is unnecessary and trifling ornaments are unlooked for  Gray'sInn Journal  SHAKESPEARE came out of Nature's hand like Pallas out of Jove's head at full growth and mature  COLMAN  Voltaire  is a genius but not of SHAKESPEARE's magnitude Without recurring to disputable authority I appeal from  Voltaire  to himself I shall not avail myself of his former encomiums on our mighty poet though the  French  critic has twice translated the same speech in  Hamlet  some years ago in admiration latterly in derision and I am sorry to find that his judgment grows weaker when it ought to be further matured  WALPOLE  Such is SHAKESPEARE's merit that the more just and refined the taste of the nation has become the more he has increased in reputation He was approved by his own age admired by the next and is revered and almost adored by the present His merit is disputed by little wits and his errors are the jests of little critics but there has not been a great poet or great critic since his time who has not spoken of him with the highest veneration Mr  Voltaire  excepted His translations often his criticisms still oftener prove he did not perfectly understand the words
