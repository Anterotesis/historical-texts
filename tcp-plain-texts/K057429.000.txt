 ON ILLICIT LOVE  ON ILLICIT LOVE  Written among the Ruins of GODSTOW NUNNERY near Oxford  Pulchra gaudet Latona Diana  Sed vetat optari faciem Lucretia qualem  Ipsa habuit  Rara est adeo concordia Formae  Atque Pudicitiae  JUVENAL  By JOHN BRAND A B Of LINCOLN COLLEGE Oxford  NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE  Printed by T SAINT for J WILKIE No St Paul's Churchyard London J FLETCHER Oxford and W CHARNLEY Newcastle  MDCCLXXV  ADVERTISEMENT  GODSTOW is at present a Ruin on the Margin of the Isis at a small distance from Oxford It was formerly a House of Nuns famous perhaps on no account so much as for having been the Burialplace of Rosamond daughter of Lord Clifford the beautiful Paramour of Henry the Second This Monarch is said to have built a Labyrinth at Woodstock to conceal her from his jealous Queen who during his Absence when he was called away by an unnatural Rebellion of his Sons at the supposed Instigation of their Mother found means to get Access to her and compelled her to swallow Poison Frequent Walks in this delightful Recess sacred to the Moments of Contempla∣tion suggested the following Thoughts for the Publication of which let the alarming Progress of Lewdness and consequently of Licentiousness of Manners which indeed threatens the Dis∣solution of our State be accepted as an Apology  ON ILLICIT LOVE    MUSAEUS  THE moral Muse from yon monastic shade  Where frown the Tow'rs by envious Time decay'd  Invites my footsteps from the flow'ry plain  And calls from Folly's rout to Fancy's train  O hallow'd Haunts where Genius loves to stray  Where silver ISIS winds her murm'ring way  Whence seen from far aspiring to the skies  The awful Fanes of BRITISH ATHENS rise  Where thro' her reeds a path as we explore  Some startled Halcyon seeks the farther shore  And all her woods and winding groves among  The lonely Philomela swells her song  Around thy verdant olives PEACE arise  Thy radiance LEARNING shines to distant skies  O sacred scenes Remembrance shall renew  And Fancy's eye with frantic bliss review  Soon shall I cease to linger with delight  And 'mid your willows meet a noonday night  Doom'd on thy banks commercial Tyne to roam  Where lev'ling PHRENZY finds her fav'rite home  Where crost AMBITION cursing all she hates  Ah dark Disturber of the peace of states  Misleads with lies an undesigning train  And drags THE MANY in her magic chain  Where PARTY rages with her Gothic pow'rs  Nor spares the Muse's shade nor Sion's bow'rs  Her rankling spleen some vilest Trash betrays  That meant for malice proves the highest praise  Her lewdest Libels court the public shame  Her base Assassins wound each envied name  Pleas'd I renew my walks by Isis' stream  Indulging Fancy's sweet extatic dream  In learned ease with devious steps I stray  Where lonely CONTEMPLATION points my way  The sedgy margin oft her step retains  When sober Ev'ning frees the servile swains  A soften'd smile unbends her brow austere  Serenely grave and pleasingly severe  Retarded now 'mid GODSTOW's walls she stands  Walls fam'd of yore the work of pious hands  Of ages past each distant deed appears  And rise the scenes of long elapsed years  In her revolving mind Tears fill her eyes  While Henry's woes and Rosamund's arise  Woes that still warn us from this Wreck of Time  A frailty fam'd and farrenowned Crime  Ah hapless Maid th' aetherial Pow'r began  While pensive sadness thro' my bosom ran  What mov'd thee first thy Fathers to disgrace  The boast and brand of Clifford's noble race  Cou'd icy Age thy youthful breast inspire  Or e'er grey hairs enkindle green desire  Love's living smile Ambition's frowns devour  And Pleasure flies the rude embrace of Pow'r  Could Henry's Crown a charm so pow'rful prove  To blanch the negro front of lawless love  Too justly blam'd to blast whose fame conspire  A Lover old wrong'd Queen and injur'd Sire  I see the Father tear his hoary hairs  And beat a bosom rack'd with hopeless cares  Invoke high Heav'n on Henry's head to show'r  The vengeful light'nings of incensed Pow'r  Bare the red arm against th' adult'rous flame  And hide in dust a darling daughter's shame  The pray'r's preferr'dNor ever move in vain  The holy lips of Age incens'd by pain  War's stern alarms their infant loves annoy  And black remorse succeeds the blaze of joy  In vain has Woodstock rear'd her haughty tow'rs  In vain immur'd thee in meand'ring bow'rs  Eludes no lab'rinth Guilt's intrusive eyes  And CONSCIENCE follows wheresoe'er she flies  How chang'd by absence  This alludes to the wars in Normandy which called Henry away soon after the commencement of this unhappy amour  ev'ry Haunt remains  The scene of pleasures past of present pains  There mourn frail Maid till o'er the murky gloom  Repentance shine to mitigate thy doom  By Man unheard unwept and unforgiv'n  The mercy Earth denies draw down from Heav'n  The dark retreats stern Jealousy explores  Fate's clue conducting thro' the mazy doors  See Guilt at once and injur'd Love arraign  While Pity pleads and Mercy moves in vain  Nor sighs nor pray'rs nor tears in torrents shed  Avert the doom from her devoted head  Till Poison's spumy bowl aveng'd the spotted bed  Here paus'd the Pow'r and having glean'd her store  From ages  past  to  future  fram'd her lore  Be warn'd ye Fair she cried by Clifford's fate  What vengeful woes on lawless love await  The phantoms Fairy Pleasure rais'd shall fall  And soon her luscious sweets be dash'd with gall  Still Pleasure flies from Guilt on flitting wings  And 'mid her flow'rs the serpent Sorrow stings  Transcribe the Tale  The History of Rosamond inscribed on the wall of the chapel which is now converted into a stable  that on this wall is wrought  The Tablet hangs a Toilette for your thought  Here looknor to those flatt'ring mirrors fly  Where souls are poison'd by the pleasur'd eye  Nor vainly wish to future fortunes blind  Lucretia's face without her fairer mind  Think then and from the crime let thought restrain  For transient joys what lasting ills remain  The fall in vain from Honour's height you mourn  In vain with tears to ruthless Man you turn  As soon the streams that down the valleys stray  Shall backwards to their fountains force a way  Sooner shall Frost its freezing pow'rs forego  And Afric's soot be chang'd to Europe's snow  Than blasted Beauty shall its bloom regain  Or female Honour soil'd remove the stain  O think as o'er th' insidious Glass you lie  When conscious Pleasure sparkles in the eye  When Caution sleeps and to th' unguarded mind  Conceit and Pride an easy entrance find  How Sense shall surfeit o'er the fairest face  If Minds too mix not in the warm embrace  How soon the vivid flush of Beauty flies  Tho' Blossoms please us 'tis the Fruit we prize  With care O cultivate in earliest youth  Perennial charms Faith Modesty and Truth  Charms that surviving Beauty's boasted claim  Rise phoenixlike from the funereal flame  Of equal worth no earthly good is told  Golconda's gems nor all Peruvia's gold  Still BRITAIN boast by circling waves embrac'd  Her young men valiant and her maidens chaste  No more on Fashion's frothy Tide be borne  But stem the Torrent you alone can turn  No more with smiles the Rake's lewd wishes fan  Refuse of stews and reliques of the man  With coy reserve th' insidious Villain view  False to himself can he have faith to you  The Fopling's fond impertinence despise  And blast his hopes with your disdainful eyes  To him in vain your rival charms are shewn  Narcissuslike he loves himself alone  'Gainst Vice in vain Religion still inveighs  While Passion sleeps nor heeds th' unmoving lays  From BEAUTY's lips the living lore would charm  And coldest Unbelief with Ardor warm  Her chast'ning pow'r the Scorner's pride would own  And Atheists tremble at her angel frown  Thro' Error's maze a Leader she would prove  And light the Lamp of pure celestial Love  On Thule's heathy heights see VIRTUE stand  With ling'ring looks prepar'd to leave the Land  To waste in northern night the lonely hour  And mourn 'mid Hecla's caves her ravish'd pow'r  See fond Affection warn her e'er she flies  And turn to you her supplicating eyes  Where Hope still struggles thro' each chrystal Tear  That watry shines and streaks the gloom of Fear  Recall her with your smiles confirm her reign  The trait'rous Rival of her empire slain  For yours for Albion's sake retard her flight  When Virtue sets 'tis Beauty's blackest night  In vain you'll mourn the absence of her ray  To ruthless Lust an unresisting Prey  Find civil Order to Confusion hurl'd  And mental Darkness overwhelm the world  Again from Lust War's fatal flame shall blaze  And other HELENS future Troys shall raze  Soon sick'ning Nature find th' abortive grave  And sink like Sodom in Perdition's wave  Nor thou fond Youth with boiling blood elate  Ah heedless of the gath'ring storms of Fate  With sophist fuel heap the blazing fire  Nor plead th' ungovern'd rage of rapt Desire  Desire newborn in the impassion'd breast  By Reason's sacred pow'r is soon supprest  But fann'd by Sloth by Reason unrestrain'd  The headlong heights of frantic Lewdness gain'd  Their Mounds in vain preventive Laws oppose  In vain her Lash shall angry Pow'r disclose  Pow'r's lash is spurn'd and Law's eluded care  Nor yields the Fury but to fell Despair  O could the Muse in Virtue's int'rests warm  Thy soften'd soul from siren pleasures charm  She would conjure thee by the Chains that bind  The social Frame and rivet mind to mind  By all the sacred Charities of life  And dearest Ties of daughter sister wife  If fervid Honour ever fir'd thy soul  Or Passion stoop'd to Reason's chaste controul  If e'er Religion watchful in thy breast  Each wanton thought in embryo supprest  Some Father's fairest hopes from ruin save  Nor give his hoary honours to the grave  No more the fort of female Virtue prove  With artful vows th' artillery of Love  Of feigned Lovethat tempting to foul Sin  Assails without and undermines within  For Pity's sake the friendless Orphan spare  Nor lure the wretched to thy lustful Snare  Ah hapless Maid to hardest trials born  When Fortune lours upon her opening morn  The dang'rous boon of tempting Charms bestows  And gives without its guardian Thorn the Rose  Soon must the shortliv'd Flow'r its sweets forego  And ruffian Lust shall crop them ere they blow  When Falshood's wiles th' unwary Maid betray  Ah meanest conquest o'er unguarded prey  Soon must the sad alternative be try'd  When Vice has vanquish'd Shame and Pleasure Pride  In Prostitution's public shrine to bleed  Till poignant pains to fleeting joys succeed  Till ev'ry evil try'd Intemp'rance knows  Wish'd Death cut short the varied line of woes  Or scorch Love's fruit by fell Abortion's flame  And blast by Murder the firstborn of Shame  Who but must shrink from the sad Scene distrest  And mourn the mischief from his inmost breast  Who but would bind in Vengeance' penal chain  The base Betrayers of the virgin train  Yet know ye prowling Wolves to Pity blind  That spare no Lambkins of the female kind  Who Love perverts with Nature wages strife  Love the great second cause in worlds of life  As Sages say Attraction's secret chain  In worlds of matter binds the starry train  A cement thus of souls Affections prove  And living Nature's all upborne by Love  Who lewdly blind this Passion points astray  And gives to govern what Heav'n bid obey  Too late shall find when frantic Lust enslaves  That Giantlike 'tis Heav'n itself he braves  Hail holy flame aetherial pure Desire  Enliv'ning Man as erst Prometheus' Fire  All Nature kindles at thy bursting beam  And Lands with Life and Ocean's waters teem  Thy ray on Greenland's icy mountains glows  And keener burns 'mid Zembla's frozen snows  To Glory's heav'nly heights how dost thou lead  The sacred Source of ev'ry daring deed  By thee the Soldier's dauntless bosom's steel'd  When danger braves him in th' embattled field  Love points the Falchion speeds the scythed Car  And Beauty's spoils repay the wounds of war  For thee the Statesman plans his deep design  And by thy light the Court's gay circles shine  Thy pow'r e'en pall'd Ambition's vot'ries prove  And Care finds respite in the arms of Love  For thee the Scholar spends his midnight oil  A purer passion animates his toil  Than Famethat faint as Echo's faintest breath  Nor lives in life nor can be heard in death  Supremely blest if lab'ring long he find  The laurel wreath with Lover's myrtle twin'd  For thee the Sailor ev'ry storm outbraves  And Lucy's smile o'erpays the frowning waves  At eve slow plodding from the labour'd plain  Mild Phillis' kiss revives her fainting Swain  How high reward when Toil his task foregoes  To find on Beauty's bosom soft repose  Search then all life each state condition prove  The purest pleasure flows from virtuous Love  O Bliss sincere if Bliss sincere can be  In the dull sphere of dark Mortality  When Sense and Soul conspire to feed a flame  That burns thro' age unchangeably the same  E'en brighter burns and brighter still the fire  That Virtue lighted up and pure Desire  Nor Time whose envious Rage would all remove  Can clip the wings of chaste connubial Love  Frail Man no more of mental ills complain  Nor mourn the progress of corporeal pain  Pandora's deadly dole whence Evil rose  The fated source of neverceasing woes  One good that ev'ry ill o'erpay'd confin'd  And Woman was the  Hope  still left behind  O Woman Source of ev'ry dear delight  That draws th' enamour'd soul and charms the sight  In whom concenters each attractive grace  That decks the mind and deifies the face  Your rubied lips distill Aurora's dew  Your breath has sweets that Hybla never knew  Your eyes outshine the silver orbs of night  Serenely gay and mild with soften'd light  O may the Guardian of so great a prize  Hesperian HONOUR watch with Argus' eyes  Breasts so serene no ruder passions tear  Nor poison lurk in Flow'rs so passing fair  So shall your arms an Amulet still prove  To ward off with'ring Care the bane of Love  For ah in vain your beauties Heav'n bestow'd  If vicious Passion foul their fair abode  Vice draws her deadliest bane from Beauty's pow'r  The rankest poison from the richest Flow'r  Nor greater Lure's her magic charms among  Not Circe's potion nor the Siren's song  Precarious Blessing to best ends design'd  But prov'd too oft the bane of woman kind  Who drink the poison of thy treach'rous eye  With Circe stabling in the swinish sty  More than deform their Maker's choicest grace  And marr the mintage of the fairest face  The Cherub Beauty chang'd foregoes her light  Like rebel Angels plung'd in rayless night  From highest heights to lowest depths declin'd  And fallen Woman's an infernal kind  But chiefly Ye o'er Honour's bounds that fly  By Lust unloos'd from Hymen's holy tie  Ye join'd in hand tho' ill your heart accords  Who fail of fealty to your lawful Lords  Yet shall the Muse indignant of your charms  'Gainst female falshood wield her dreaded arms  Tho' lavish Nature ev'ry grace bestows  And blends the Lilly with the vermeil Rose  The faultless form with the celestial face  Attemper'd to Proportion's sweetest grace  Charms that intense as Cleopatra's prove  And flinty Valour fuse in flames of Love  Abhor alike with guilty Grr's name  And damn with Dhff to undying shame  FINIS
