Fellow  The Rest is all but Leather and Prunella  POPE  TO THE GREATEST COXCOMB AND MOST FINISH'D COQUETTE Living  SIR and MADAM  IT has long been and still remains a settled Rule with AUTHORS to chuse the most conspicuous Characters for Patrons thus far I comply with general Custom which however ridiculous it is dangerous to break through as to the trite Panegyrics of Dedication they seem absolutely unnecessary upon the present Occasion for your VirtuesQualifications I mean are so very generally known that they require not any Illustration being sufficient Blazon to themselves therefore it will be sufficient to observe that to your great Predecessors the DRAMA is obliged for many of its most striking Characters To you and your courtly Tribe of Imitators we stand indebted for the frequent curious Amendments of FASHION and Machinations of LOVE also for OPERAS BURLETTAS MASQUERADES PANTOMIMES DRUMS ROUTS with a long c of  Timekilling  Amusements and last  though not least in Love  for the following Tale founded on your Systems of Life which Circumstance must particularly recommend it to your most indulgent Patronage  'TIS true I may appear in this Address as an INDIAN worshipping the Devil however that may be it will evidently follow from One Consideration that I have an undoubted Right to claim your Patronage when I declare that many Actions of my own Life have been truly  Coxcomical  and perhaps not One of them more so than my Compliance with the  Cacoethes Scribendi  which urged me to commence AUTHORâ–ª especially a Poetical or Versifying One  I am with all due Respect as a Writer and sincere Affection as  Relation  Your most obedient And devoted Servant The  AUTHOR  I had almost dated this Address  April  the  First  but being sensible that it was giving the CRITICS a fair Opportunity to honour me with the  Title  of the  Day  I step Four and Twenty Hours forward in the Year  ADVERTISEMENT  TO THE PUBLIC  KNOWING from personal Experience how apt prefatory Matter is to pall I shall no farther intrude upon the Leisure of my Readers than briefly to observe that the following Narration is founded on Truth that it is related exclusive of an Alteration in the Catastrophe of  NARCISSA  with strict Fidelity What Merit there may be in it I shall leave the Public to decide I am well apprized that the Characters will seem somewhat imperfect particularly  ELIZA  who does not appear sufficiently to constitute a Principal but I hope to be excused any Error of this Kind though voluntary as I found Prolixity stealing in upon me which I was resolved at any Rate to avoid  I should perhaps have thrown the Incidents together in Prose but that I think the Town already too much harrassed with  MEMOIRS ADVENTURES  c This is a Sort of Deviation and I hope some Persons of stronger Genius than I imagine myself to be will communicate Pictures of Life in poetical Narratives  Upon the Whole as I know many Faults must appear I earnestly request that every judicious Reader will make such Amendments as seem necessary and render it if possible agreeable to his or her Taste believing I should have done the same had it been in my Power  London

gentle Antidote of all its Cares  Thou calm Recess of an o'erburthen'd Mind  The Chains of rough Adversity unbind  Then to forget myself I ask thy Aid  Oh snatch me from the Gloom of Fortune's Shade  For tender Fancy struggles hard to rise  Through the sharp Gales and Frosts of wint'ry Skies  Bear from dull Earth on thy expanded Wing  And teach thy humble Proselyte to sing  With sprightly Elegance of Thought inspire  Enflame my Bosom with poetic Fire  Strike with bold Imag'ry and tune my Verse  While fabled Truths a moral Tale rehearse  ANSELMO wearied with a trading Life  Resolv'd to fly Solicitude and Strife  To lay the anxious Cares of Business down  And shun the Bustle of the noisy Town  Nature had mingled in ANSELMO'S Frame  A Love of Virtue and Contempt of Fame  Grave without Pride though prudent not severe  Of Honour boundless and of Judgment clear  To Censure slow to Pardon always free  The Friend of Mankind and of Liberty  Who could with equal Honesty despise  The Fools of Pow'r or the corrupted Wise  A venal Commoner or lordly Knave  A mitred Deist or a willing Slave  A grapling Miser or a Spendthrift Heir  An impious Rakehell or abandon'd Fair  A shameless Sinner or affected Saint  A Mind of Fallacy or Face of Paint  FORTUNE had bless'd him with sufficient Store  And REASON wisely told him seek no more  HE chose a lonely yet delightful Seat  Where ev'ry Comfort crown'd the bless'd Retreat  Where Joys unknown to pompous Pride and Pow'r  Danc'd on the Wings of ev'ry passing Hour  Content the Goddess of supreme Delight  Still cheer'd the Day and balm'd the happy Night  Here safe calm Peace could smile at distant Wars  The Cannon's Thunder and loud Statesmen's Jars  Religion here divested of all Art  Conjoin'd with Reason to amend the Heart  Just in her Tenets in her Doctrine clear  Placid in Zeal not formally severe  HERE Charity in all her native Charms  Call'd faint Distress to her enliv'ning Arms  Dispers'd the Cloud of Woe with sunlike Beams  And scatter'd Bounty in diffusive Streams  No Widow here e'er bootless told her Pain  No helpless Orphan stream'd with Tears in vain  ANSELMO had but one remaining Care  Of which two Daughters claim'd an equal Share  The Elder deem'd beyond Description fair  NARCISSA so the lovely Nymph we call  In Shape was delicate in Stature tall  Her blooming Cheeks made pale the Tyrian Dye  And Cupids ambush'd in each sparkling Eye  With ev'ry Glance flew forth a golden Dart  The certain Conquest of a wounded Heart  Her Charms diffus'd a World of pleasing Pains  And fetter'd half Mankind in am'rous Chains  Each public Place reecho'd with her Fame  And thriving Vintners bless'd her lucky Name  For Sons of Bacchus holding her Divine  Pouring Libations empti'd Tons of Wine  To shew his Taste in panegyric Lays  Each Witling strove to celebrate her Praise  BEAUS with their Taylors' and their Barbers' Aid  For Beaus are but mechanically made  In foppish Emulation vainly strove  To catch the Fair One's Eye and win her Love  While she convinc'd of her extensive Pow'r  Studied to gain new Conquests ev'ry Hour  A Thousand little practis'd Arts she tries  CUPID the PROTEUS of her varying Eyes  Veil'd in the Ambush of their dazling Rays  Fill'd each Beholder with an am'rous blaze  While she with Pride beheld each subject Swain  With Rapture saw and triumph'd in his Pain  PALE Envy sat on ev'ry Female Brow  To see those Charms which Envy must allow  NARCISSA'S Beauty Rivals  would  not see  But thus anatomiz'd her over Tea  HERE One can plainly in Complexion trace  Undoubted Symptons of a borrow'd Face  The next a Dart of Criticism throws  Against the Disproportion of her Nose  A Third's sarcastic on her jetty Hair  A Fourth discovers her immodest Stare  A Fifth for not one Atom can escape  Distorts maliciously her matchless Shape  A Sixth to sum up all with Heart elate  Descants at large upon her awkward Gait  THUS feeble Envy like a sable Cloud  Which strives the Sun's enliv'ning Rays to shrowd  Labour'd t'envelop with its tainting Shade  The radiant Beauties of this lovely Maid  But as the God of Day triumphant reigns  His Beams unsullied with polluting Stains  Thus shone the Maid through Scandal's pois'nous Gloom  In all the Lustre of Meridian Bloom  Though clog'd with Malice still she soar'd above  Hail'd as the Shrine of universal Love  No Wonder if NARCISSA forc'd to leave  The Mart of Beauty should reluctant grieve  To yield the Spoil of Three coquetted Years  Call'd forth the Tribute of some pearly Tears  She wept she murmur'd at the hard Decree  So inconsistent with her Gaiety  She found no Pleasure in the rural Plains  Reflection suited not her want of Brains  For ohthough sad the Truth we must declare  This lovely Maid so exquisitely fair  Whose sparkling Eyes could Joy or Pain dispense  Wanted the Attribute of  CommonSense  And selfsufficient like all other Fools  Still soar'd beyond the mean constraint of Rules  Reason's sage dictates still she could resist  And just had Head enough to play at WHIST  ANSELMO saw her Levity with Pain  And often spoke but always spoke in vain  She had been told a Sire declin'd in Age  Near to his Exit from this mortal Stage  Should not with antiquated Rules controul  The modish Sallies of a Daughter's Soul  The Joys of boundless Liberty she chose  And look'd on  prudent  Friends as  envious  Foes  A Father's Care her Folly deem'd his Vice  And call'd restraining Love his Avarice  ELIZA Sister to this witless Thing  This flimsey Butterfly with gilded Wing  Fell far beneath in the external Part  Yet rose superior in an honest Heart  THOUGH Nature furnish'd not those fleeting Charms  Which Sickness oft but surely Age disarms  Those Eyedelighting Beauties of an Hour  Which one rough Blast can instantly devour  A Mind to no unruly Passion Slave  The great and just Equivalent she gave  IN strict Compliance did ELIZA move  With filial Piety and kindred Love  Though youngest took a Housewife's homely Care  Nor would her Sister ever deign to share  Receiv'd her Father's Precepts as her Guide  And prudently a Mother's Place supply'd  Domestics with her mild Deportment won  With Emulation to their Duty run  The humble Villagers who liv'd around  From her good Humour gentle Treatment found  With chearful Countenance she would resort  To rural Festivals and share their Sport  And sometimes gaily join as if by Chance  In the rude Measures of the rustic Dance  While vain NARCISSA with disdainful Brow  From Pride's high Throne o'erlook'd the poor below  SCARCE had ANSELMO been three Months at Rest  Three little Months with Solitude been bless'd  When this unthinking Object of his Love  Tormented her fond Parent to remove  To quit the Country for the gayer Town  Where various Pleasures various Minutes crown  Where as she said there are a thousand Ways  As Drums and Balls and Masquerades and Plays  To plume with Joy the drooping Wings of Time  And waft direct to Happiness sublime  "THOU know'st my Child replies the tender Sire  "I still have gratifi'd each fond Desire  "Review thy scanty Catalogue of Years  "Behold my Tenderness my anxious Fears  "When did'st thou task my utmost Pow'r in vain  "Did'st thou e'er singly feel or Joy or Pain  "Why wou'd'st thou then a wish'd Repose deny  "To see a Father happy dost thou sigh  "Why sits that moody Frontlet on thy Brow  "Does Gratitude thy Discontent allow  "Think my NARCISSA of thy wild Demand  "Nor seek for Ruin at ANSELMO'S Hand  "If my Indulgence let thy Spirits roam  "Discretion urges me to call 'em Home  "LIFE Nature's turbulent and dang'rous Sea  "Is form'd of complicate Variety  "Here wanton SunBeams on smooth Waters play  "And all within the calm Horizon's Gay  "But farther on a furious Tempest roars  "While wat'ry Mountains burst on trembling Shores  "Ten Thousand Shoals and Rocks in Ambush wait  "The secret sudden Ministers of Fate  "Youth's fragile Barks with silken Tackle Ride  "On the smooth Stream of Folly's faithless Tide  "Unnumber'd Prospects of Delusion Glare  "Which lead into the Eddies of Despair  "Vice guiding rash Adventurers along  "To Fate allures them with her Syren Song  "Experience only can through Dangers steer  "And wisely with the Turns of Fortune veer  "Then slight not the Affection that wou'd save  "Thy tender Youth from Fate's o'erwhelming Wave"  ANSELMO here gave Admonition o'er  NARCISSA wearied long had Wish no more  Her flighty Soul cou'd modishly despise  The prudent Hints of being sometimes Wise  And all the Knowledge which her Father taught  A tedious tasteless Homily she thought  Not long she griev'd at her eclipsing State  Her Freedom came upon the Wing of Fate  For Six revolving Moons had scarcely past  Before the good ANSELMO breath'd his last  In a malignant Fever's deadly Guise  Pale ATROPOS seal'd up her Father's Eyes  WHILE on the Bed of gloomy Death he lay  In all the Agony of swift Decay  His Eyes o'erflowing with Affection's Tide  To see his Daughters mourning by his Side  He snatch'd from vast Eternity and Prayer  A few short Moments for his worldly Care  Spoke all the Precepts of a happy Life  Adapted to the Maiden and the Wife  And recommended with his dying Voice  Untainted Virtue as the wisest Choice  A strict Compliance with her Laws requir'd  Then sunk at once and blessing them expir'd  THIS fatal Chance this unexpected Dart  Shot Pains unnumber'd through ELIZA'S Heart  Her Breast full fraught with Love's abundant Store  In bursting Groans reeccho'd "He's no mre  "Ye Nymphs and Swains in solemn Chorus join  "And let your Voices catch the Tone of mine  "Let me depriv'd of Comfort's cheering Beam  "Let me instruct your pious Eyes to stream  "For none like me the mighty Loss can tell  "How many Virtues with ANSELMO fell  "Weep weep ye Indigent your Bosoms rend  "Like me you've lost a Father and a Friend"  In such sad Wailings her Affection spoke  Her filial Sorrow for the fatal Stroke  NARCISSA marblehearted to all Woe  But such as could from Disappointment flow  She who had never minister'd Relief  Who ne'er was gloom'd but with a selfish Grief  Ev'n she vouchsaf'd some pious Tears to shed  Nature's last Tribute to a Parent dead  But soon the Cloud of fleeting Care gave Way  When sigh'd for Pleasures beam'd their dazling Ray  Fresh Conquests danc'd before her raptur'd View  She long'd her lost Dominion to renew  And Fortune join'd with Inclination here  To give that Liberty she held so dear  For upon Fate's unalterable Page  She stood recorded of a legal Age  No Guardian's sage Impertinence she fears  To rule the Conduct of Discretion's Years  And on a careful Scrutiny she found  Her Portion counted twice ten thousand Pound  WING'D with the Gold she took a sudden Flight  And quickly gain'd the Region of Delight  LONDON dear LONDON that bewitching Place  That happy Market for a lovely Face  LONDON the Seat of Industry and Play  LONDON the great the populous and gay  LONDON possess'd of Worthies and of Knaves  Of ev'ry Clime and each Degree but Slaves  LONDON where Trade and lighter Pleasures smile  LONDON the Pride the Glory of this Isle  NARCISSA bless'd with absolute Command  Sets up an Equipage with lavish Hand  Her Splendour more than former Fame restores  Each Milliner admires each Fop adores  The brilliant Fair all Connoisseurs confess  The Soul of Fashion and the Life of Dress  Two Years a Life of Elegance she led  Pass'd Nights in Revelry and Days in Bed  Suitors unnumber'd pleaded Love sincere  But none with Titles suited to her Ear  She thought her boundless Charms might justly claim  Some honourable prelude to her Name  Your Ladyship"No no a higher Place  "Hail me kind Fortune with the Title  Grace"  This was the constant Subject of her Care  Her sole remaining Wish and only Pray'r  For though she went to Church each Sabbath Day  Her Business was to Ogle not to Pray  AT length Fate join'd to her admiring Train  The wish'd for Conquest of a lorded Swain  The gay CAMILLO Master of those Arts  Which serve to triumph o'er coquetish Hearts  Who though in  Parliament  he always sate  A perfect Monosyllable of State  In Politics a very harmless Peer  In Love still thunder'd on with bold Career  Through each Degree of Galantry he rov'd  And now a Countess then a MilkMaid lov'd  With equal Ardour flew at any Game  For high and low possess'd an equal Flame  While Fortune still throughout his am'rous Round  The noble Peer with countless Conquests crown'd  Nor should we wonder at his boundless Reign  No less his happy Attributes cou'd gain  For though the Knowledge of this titled Prig  Could climb but to a fashionable Wig  Though Books he little knew and Virtue less  He was an Adept in the Art of Dress  His Cloaths were glaring he could dance and game  Swear fawn and lie untouch'd with conscious Shame  To these a paltry Cunning we may add  Which shew'd a worthless Head and Heart as bad  HE saw the Failings of NARCISSA'S Mind  To all the Dictates of Discretion blind  At Cards he watch'd the Motions of her Soul  And saw her variegated Passions roll  Saw gay Success her lovely Face embloom  And Disappointment all her Beauties gloom  With Love of Play he join'd her boundless Pride  And craftily appointed them his Guide  By their Assistance he resolv'd to move  And humble this proud Citadel of Love  HIS Scheme propos'd at length the Siege began  The Lady too had form'd a previous Plan  And all the Motions of each Side confess  Both Parties well acquainted with Finesse  He still approached in Love's sincerest 'Guise  She play'd th'Artillery of sparkling Eyes  He  breath'd his Vows with a pathetic Grace  She  deign'd to listen with a smiling Face  And then was most particularly gay  When he politely lost his Stakes at Play  Much Time elaps'd without a Conquest gain'd  For both alike invincible remain'd  NARCISSA would have yielded as a Wife  But then CAMILLO lov'd a single Life  WHILE Matters thus remain'd in dubious Sense  And both were almost wearied with Suspense  Misfortune which too often will prevail  Cast a large Balance in his Lordship's Scale  NARCISSSA rising from her Bed one Morn  Gay as those Beams which Eastern Hills adorn  Successive Pleasures justling in her Brain  Found the gay Prospect of Idea vain  And with a sudden Shock of ruthless Fate  Fell from the Glory of her dazling Height  A LETTER came suppos'd the Sacrifise  Of some poor Swain the Captive of her Eyes  She cry'dA  Lady  FANCIFUL in Mind  "Oh wherefore was I born to plague Mankind"  With gentle Indolence she broke the Seal  Unknowing what her Vanity must feel  When lo in fatal Characters she read  That Bankrupt PHILO her Trustee was fled  That with her Fortune all her Hopes were dead  AMAZE and Madness trembled in her Face  And crowding Passions gave each other Chace  First silent Horror took its chilly Reign  And icicled her Blood through ev'ry Vein  Her shudd'ring Limbs an aguish Soul confess'd  Then climbing Rage enflam'd her tender Breast  At last the Thundercloud of Nature breaks  In briny Torrents down her pallid Cheeks  In hopes to mitigate her raging Pain  At Intervals she read her Fate again  But where th'unhappy Fair One sought Relief  She met the Confirmation of her Grief  Four restless Days and sleepless Nights she pass'd  And wish'd each Woe fraught Minute was her last  A CROWD of Visitors approach'd her Door  Yet unacquainted with her being Poor  But all the Servants were desir'd to tell  Each courtly Friend their Lady was not well  A Thousand Cards of Compliments there came  In Language and Sincerity the same  Perplex'd NARCISSA no Asylum knew  Through the maz'd Labyrinth of Thought she flew  But no kind Hope its cheering Beam wou'd shew  Through the Dark Cloud of her obscuring Woe  THUS hunted by Misfortune to a Bay  Distraction led and she pursu'd the Way  Resolv'd by des'prate Means to keep her State  Or fall a Victim of relentless Fate  So acts the lordly Tyrant of the Wood  When Hunters seek to revel in his Blood  A dangerous unequal Fight he tries  And lives triumphant or triumphant dies  THE fair unfortunate her Stock look'd o'er  And found two hundred Guineas all her Store  On this small Pittance strait she sallied out  With eager Haste to Lady GAMEWELL'S Route  In all the Splendor of an Eastern Bride  And her false Spirits deck'd in falser Pride  Each told how much her Absence had been mourn'd  And complimented on her Health return'd  But above all CAMILLO vow'd his Pain  And said that Joy return'd with her again  To Cards in Parties all with Speed retir'd  Each Bosom with a Love of Gain inspir'd  Here eager Hope appears in eager Eyes  See in one Trick the gay Delusion flies  There angry Looks dark Discontent betray  One luckless Card can strike with pale Dismay  Now some with jocund Hearts their Bets receive  While those who lose with trembling Fingers give  A gen'ral Silence rul'd external Parts  Yet various Tumults reign'd in various Hearts  FORTUNE reviews their anxious Fears and Wiles  And justly at the mad Assembly smiles  Yet undetermin'd where Success to bring  Sometime she flutter'd on a dubious Wing  At length by Accident she chanc'd to light  Blessing NARCISSA with a golden Flight  Five Hundred Guineas with harmonious Notes  Beyond the Warblings of Italian Throats  Chink'd in her Ears and to th'enliv'ning Sound  Her newborn Spirits beat a nimble Round  Her Joyfill'd Eyes look'd eminently gay  And though unrested rival'd rising Day  CAMILLO saw the Transports of her Breast  And with mean Art a Sympathy profess'd  Swore  her  Success much greater Pleasure gave  Than any Flow of Fortune  he  cou'd have  Vow'd her Content superior to his own  And that her Joys to him were Joys alone  Then proudly usher'd the victorious Fair  And led the Way to her attending Chair  Requested Leave to visit her at Home  She smil'd Assent and told him "He might come"  Now all departing to their Beds retreated  Both those with Conquest crown'd and those defeated  But diff'rent Fortunes diff'rent Vigils kept  And hardly one of either Party slept  Here Rest was murder'd in the Loser's Pain  There conquer'd by exhilerating Gain  TRUE to the Touch that Day his Lordship came  To paint his inextinguishable Flame  NARCISSA on precarious Footing plac'd  Thought it imprudent to be coyly c h ste  Therefore politically cast aside  Affected Levity and distant Pride  Therefore with grave Attention heard his Tale  Convinc'd her Eyes must certainly prevail  Convinc'd the Lover to escape his Pains  Wou'd nooze himself in matrimonial Chains  Each Day he visited each Day she thought  The Period of Advancement nearer brought  But ah weak Maid in all her Projects vain  Love struck her Heart without a Sense of Pain  Love of the gay Deceiver gently stole  And unperceiv'd enthrall'd her roving Soul  The Sigh affected once sincerely heaves  CAMILLO flatters and NARCISSA b'lieves  WHEN he beheld the Captive in his Pow'r  He villainously seiz'd a pliant Hour  When pow'rful Nature bore imperial Sway  And her dilated Mind was freely gay  Then with the Force of stimulative Art  Enfeebl'd Reason and enflam'd her Heart  Down with false Vows her struggling Virtue bore  Enjoy'd his utmost Wish and sigh'd no more  Then left her hastily with cold Respect  LOTHARIO like at leisure to reflect  THIS was NARCISSA'S Aera of Distress  Her little Comfort grew each Moment less  Tortur'd with Love and disappointed Hope  She gave the Fury of her Madness Scope  Wild as a Tempest of the North she rav'd  And from avenging Heav'n Assistance crav'd  While her Gallant divulg'd to babbling Fame  The Secret of  his  Villainy  her  Shame  His dauntless Infamy Remorse defies  And the black Tale on blacker Scandal flies  In one short Day through Thousands swiftly goes  A standing Jest for Prudes Coquets and Beaus  Hastes to the Knowledge of the Grubstreet Throng  And strait becomes the Subject of a Song  THUS the bewitching but uncautious Maid  By Fortune and by Fallacy betray'd  Rent with the Rage of agonizing Thought  When past the Nine Days' Wonder of her Fault  Was metamorphos'd as by magic Spell  And to the Shade of dark Oblivion fellâ–ª  APPROACHING Penury again assail'd  Which with lost Fame o'er Penitence prevail'd  Another Lover she at length obtain'd  And he too shortly all his Wishes gain'd  Then soon revolted from her fading Charms  And left for others her incircling Arms  A Third a Fourth succeeded and were blest  But each one prov'd inconstant as the rest  Thus half a Bedlamite through Shame she ran  The justly irritated Foe of Man  To Vice a Captive and afraid to think  Took the sad Refuge of oblivious Drink  In Bacchanalian Chains her Reason bound  Thus seal'd her Ruin thus Destruction crown'd  For soon her blooming Beauty felt Decay  And with her Charms Subsistence drop'd away  Yet to the last her Follies she pursu'd  Till dreaded Poverty at length ensu'd  Till she was plac'd by Fate's relentless Power  Where human Wretchedness cou'd fall no lower  PROSPERITY here turn thy sparkling Eye  And view the Ravage of Adversity  See Desolation spread o'er ev'ry Part  Glare in her Eyes and rankle in her Heart  See those soft Limbs which in full Fortune wore  The richest Produce of each trading Shore  For Maintenance their gaudy Rayment fold  now and shiv'ring with the Cold  that nice Palate with rich Viands fed  Enjoy the simple Sustenance of Bread  With no Dilution to imbibe when dry  But such as Springs and friendly Streams supply  See her beneath a dropping Penthouse creep  There in sad Exigence behold her sleep  A damp uncomfortable Stone her Bed  And the rude Pillow of her houseless Head  That Soul which lightest Trifles cou'd affright  Sleeps in the Horrors of a Winter's Night  Though Hurricanes the Face of Heav'n deform  Sleeps in the Tumult of the raging Storm  TELL thy gay Minions of their empty Pride  Borne on the Waves of Fortune's golden Tide  How near Mortality's allied to Woe  In the sad Prospect of NARCISSA shew  See that wreck'd Form so late admir'd by all  See her Distress and tremble at her fall  ELIZA whom we have so long forgot  On Life's vast Stage had found a milder Lot  We meet her settled in a rural Life  A tender Mother and a prudent Wife  Though she too lost her patrimonial Right  Discretion guarded her 'gainst Fortune's Spite  For by the Help of Industry she gain'd  A Mansion where Contentment ever reign'd  Where Neatness shone beyond a splendid Glare  And void of Grandeur it was void of Care  NARCISSA'S stubborn Pride though fall'n so low  Disdain'd to let her tender Sister know  The tragic Story of her matchless Woe  OFT' had ELIZA wrote but still in vain  Her Love could never friendly Answer gain  Remov'd from Town she knew not what had past  But the sad Tidings reach'd her Ears at last  Wing'd on Affection swift as fleeting Thought  To Town she flew and poor NARCISSA sought  From Street to Street incessantly she went  Yet a long Week in fruitless Searches spent  At length the Object of her Care she found  In wretched State upon the flinty Ground  Struck with the Sight immoveable she stood  While Horror Shame and Anguish thrill'd her Blood  Soon as Speech triumph'd o'er the Bonds of Grief  Look up she cried "I come to give Relief  "Come wretched Sister from the Earth arise"  At this NARCISSA rais'd her languid Eyes  Drop'd a few silent Tears let fall her Head  While in a Sigh her shatter'd Spirit fled  ELIZA thought 'twas only Strength that fail'd  She knew not that tyrannic Death prevail'd  But soon was told that his unerring Dart  Had pierc'd incurably her Sister's Heart  Convinc'd no Care no human Pow'r cou'd save  With pious Tears she wet NARCISSA'S Grave  Then hasted homeward to her humble Seat  To taste the Comforts of her calm Retreat  There still remains contented there to live  On those Enjoyments Heav'n is pleas'd to give  Nor does her humble Gratitude aspire  And cultivate irregular Desire  No idle Wishes envious Poison mix  Unmov'd she views a Neighbour's  CoachandSix  BEHOLD her ye NARCISSAS of the Age  Who gayly flutter on Life's transient Stage  To imitate her Virtues be your Care  Prefer a perfect Mind to Grandeur's Glare  For she that's  best  is Fairest of the Fair  FINIS
