 An ANSWER To The Tale of a Nettle  Written by D D'FOE  WHen the Good Man was won to so Gracious a Deed  As to Tolerate the  Nettle  and his Cursed Seed  He ne'er imagin'd this  Vip'rous Brood  Wou'd be so Ungrateful and monstrously Rude  As to plead any Title to the  Right of his Ground    Which had Cost the  Just Man  so many fair Pound  He then cast about what to do in the main  And  Council  he call'd to advise with the same  Good Sir  says the Council  do but try 'um with speed  They pretend to much Sanctity call em selves the Lords seed  And none are so righteous and seemingls Holly  As the Offspring of  Nettle  Hypocritical Folly  I presume you have gotten and instead of being just  I doubt they'll Betrap you on any disgust  Therefore I advise you without more ado  You now being old may grow wiser too  For Experience will teach what I now shall declare  Let none in your Ground any port of it share  But such as will swear to be True to your Heir  And Support You and Him against all Invaders  Of Yours and his Right let no desperate Bravado's  Make you the more fear them or esteem your self little  For they'll soon cut you out by the Scythe or the Sickle  If once they are sure that you dread their Power  You nor Yours shall never be quiet one Hour  I thank you good Friend for your good Advice  I'll follow your Counsel and strait in a trice  He summon'd the  Nettles  and told them the Cause  A Motion he made for to bind them in Laws  For their good and's own and so would in short  Admit them to hold that Possession in part  Of his Ground they possessed if they would with speed  Swear to preserve it to him and his Seed  They unanimously consented and without more ado  Took the Oaths unto Him and his Succeffor too  Thus being admitted to a free Toleration  A handle they got for their present Possession  And now they began to dispute with their  MastÃªr    And incroached on him even faster and faster  And told him in short they'd aright to his Land  For he gave 'em Possession under his own Hand  And thus they daily created Him trouble  And plaguly vex'd the good Man that was Noble  They mighty Combustion did raise in his Ground  And  Cedars  and  Elms  they met their Deaths Wound  And all sorts of Trees that were  Royally  given  Were rooted up quite tho' their Tops reach'd to Heaven  And after they had thus destroy'd his Possession  The  RoyalOaksHead  was cut off by Commission  And nothing there left but  Brdmbles  and  Bushes    Viporous Stinging  Nettles  and silly poor  Rushes    The  Bramble  bore sway and beat down the rest  Of all his fine Plants and Fruits of the best  And so it continued in Confusion so long  Till  Right  did take Place and o'ercome  Wrong  And now since the  Ground  is restored as before  Take care how the  Nettle  Stings you any more  And since the  Handle  you have once again got  Keep it fast lest your  Ground  goes once more to Pot  Oxford  Printed in the Year
