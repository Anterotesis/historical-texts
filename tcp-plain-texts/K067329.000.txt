 HORAE LYRICAE  POEMS Chiefly of the  Lyric kind  In Two Books  I SONGS  c  Sacred to DEVOTION  II ODES ELEGYS  c  to VERTUE  Loyalty  and  Friendship  By  I WATTS  Si non  Uranie  lyram  Coelestem cohibet nec  Polyhymnia  Humanum resugit tendere barbiton  Horat  Od    Imitat  Pythag  Aur Carm  LONDON  Printed by  S  and  D Bridge  for  John Lawrence  at the Sign of the  Angel  in the  Poultrey  MDCCVI  PREFACE  IT has been a long Complaint of the Vertuous and Refined World that Poesie whose Original is Divine should be enslav'd to Vice and Profaneness that an Art inspired from Heaven should have so far lost the Memory of its Birthplace as to be ingaged in the Interests of Hell and bring all her resistless Forces of Metaphor Wit Rhyme and Number and range them under the Banner of the Great Malicious Spirit to assault the Honour of God and the Souls of Men  The Eldest Song which History has brought down to our Ears was a noble Act of Worship paid to the God of  Israel    When his  Right hand became glorious in Power when thy Right hand O Lord dashed in pieces the Enemy the Chariots of Pharaoh and his Host were cast into the RedSea Thou didst blow with thy Wind the Deep covered them and they sank as Lead in the mighty Waters  Exod  This Art was maintain'd Sacred thro' the following Ages of the Church and imploy'd by Kings and Prophets by  David    Solomon  and  Isaiah  in breathing the Life of Angels into the Hearts of Men and rearing their Minds Heavenward in warm and tuneful Devotion  In the Younger Days of Heathenism the Muses were devoted to the same Service The Language in which Old  Hesiod  addresses them is this    In English  Pierian Muses fam'd for Heavenly Lays  Descend and sing the God your Fathers Praise  And the pursues the Subject in ten Pious Lines which I could not forbear to Transcribe if the Aspect and Sound of so much  Greek  were not terrifying to a nice Reader  But some of the later Poets of the  Pagan  World have more debased this Divine Gift and many of the Writers of first Rank in this our Age of National Christians have to their Eternal Shame surpassed the vilest of the Gentiles They have Expos'd Religion to Drollery and drest her up in the most Ridiculous Habit for the Scorn of the ruder Herd of Mankind They have painted the Vices like so many Goddesses added the Charms of Wit to Debauchery and heightned the Temptation where Nature needs the strongest Restraints With Sweetness of Sound and Delicacy of Expression they have given a Relish to Blasphemies of the harshest kind and when they rant at their Maker in Sonorous Numbers they fancy themselves to have acted the Hero well  Thus almost in vain have the Throne and the Pulpit cried  Reformation  while the Stage and Licentious Poems have waged open War with the Pious Design of Church and State The Press has spread the Poyson far and scatter'd wide the Mortal Infection Unthinking Youth have been allured to Sin beyond the Vicious Propensities of Nature plung'd early into Diseases and Death and sunk down to Damnation in Multitudes How will these Allies of the Nether World the Lewd and Profane Versifiers stand aghast before the Great Judge when the Blood of many Souls whom they never saw shall be laid to the Charge of their Writings and be dreadfully requir'd at their Hands The Reverend Mr  Collier  has set this Awful Scene before them in just and flaming Colours and if the Application were not too rude and uncivil that noble Stanza of my Lord  Roscommon  on  Psal  might be address'd to them  Ye Dragons whose Contagious Breath  Peoples the dark Retreats of Death  Change your dire Hissings into Heav'nly Songs  And praise your Maker with your Forked Tongues  But alass there is a deep Silence among these Men of all Divine Subjects unless in Banter The Wonders of Creating Power the Mysteries of Redeeming Love and the mighty Works of Renewing Grace are neglected by those whom Heaven has indued with a Gift proper to adorn and cultivate 'em An Art whose sweet Insinuations might have almost  convey'd Piety into resisting Nature and melted Souls of Iron to the Love of Virtue  Will the Writers of this Age cite the  French  Critic on their side and say  De la Foy d'un Chr√©tien les Mysteres terribles  D'Ornemens egayez ne sont point susceptibles  That the Mysteries of Christianity are not capable of  Ornaments The  Davideis  and the two  Arthurs  broke down this Obstacle and experimentally  futed the vain pretence  Besides the Christian Mysteries have no need of these Tinsel Trappings the Glories of our Religion in a plain Narration and a simple Dress have something brighter and bolder in them something more surprizing and Divine than all the Adventures of Gods and Heroes all the dazling Images of false lustre that compose and garnish a Heathen Poem here the Subjects themselves would give wonderful Aids to the Muse and the Heavenly Theme would so relieve a dull Hour and a languishing Genius that when the Muse nods the Sense would burn and sparkle upon the Reader and keep him feelingly awake  With how much less toil and expence might a  Dryden  an  Otway  a  Congreve  or a  Dennis  furnish out a Christian Poem than a Modern Play there is nothing amongst all the Ancient Fables or Later Romances that have two such Extremes united in them as the Eternal God becoming an Infant of Days the Possessor of the Pallace of Heaven laid to  Sleep in a Manger the Holy  Jesus  who knew no Sin bearing the Sins of Men in his Body on the Tree Agonies of Sorrow loading the Soul of him who was God over all Blessed for ever and the Soveraign of Life stretching his Arms on a Cross Bleeding and Expiring The Heaven and the Hell in our Divinity are infinitely more delightful and dreadful than the Childish Figments of a Dog with three Heads the Buckets of the  Belides  the Furies with Snaky Hairs or all the Flow'ry Stories of  Elysium  Aud if we survey the one as Themes Divinely True and the other as a Medly of Fooleries which we can never believe the advantage for touching the Springs of Passion will fall infinitely on the side of the Christian Poet our Wonder and our Love our Pity Delight and Sorrow with the long train of Hopes and Fears must needs be under the Command of an Harmonious Pen whose every Line makes a part of the Reader's Faith and is the very Life or Death of his Soul  If the trifling and incredible Tales that furnish out a Tragedy are so arm'd by Wit and Fancy as to become Soveraign of the Rational Powers to triumph over all the Affections and manage our Smiles and our Tears at pleasure how wondrous a Conquest might be obtain'd over a wild World and reduce it at least to Sobriety if the same Happy Talent were employed in dressing the Scenes of Religion in their proper Figures of Majesty Beauty and Terror The Affairs of this Life with their reference to a Life to come would shine bright in a Dramatick Description The Anguish of inward Guilt the secret Stings  and Racks and Scourges of Conscience the sweet retiring Hours and Seraphical Joys of Devotion the Victory of a Resolved Soul over a thousand Temptations the Inimitable Love and Passion of a Dying God the Awful Glories of the last Tribunal the grand Decisive Sentence from which there is no Appeal and the Consequent Transports or Horrors of the two Eternal Worlds How would such a Performance call back the dying Piety of the Nation to Life and Beauty It would make Religion appear like it self and confound the Blasphemies of a profligate World ignorant of Pious Pleasures  But we have reason to fear that the Tuneful Men of our Day have not rais'd their Ambition to so Divine a Pitch I should rejoyce to see more of this Coelestial Fire kindling within them for the Flashes that break out in some present and past Writings betray an Infernal Source This the Incomparable Mr  Cowley  in the latter End of his Preface and the Ingenious Sir  Richard Blackmore  in the beginning of his have so pathetically describ'd and lamented and I rather refer the Reader to mourn with them than detain and tire him here These Gentlemen in their large and laboured Works of Poesie have given the World happy Examples of what they wish and incourage in Prose The One in a rich Variety of Thought and Fancy the Other in all the Beauties of Profuse and Florid Diction  If shorter Sonnets were compos'd on sublime Subjects such as the Psalms of  David  and the Holy Transports interspers'd in the other Sacred Writings or such as the Moral Odes of  Horace  and the Ancient  Lyricks  I perswade my self that the Christian Preacher would find abundant Aid from the Poet in his Design to diffuse Vertue and allure Souls to God If the Heart were first inflam'd from Heaven and the Muse were not left alone to form the Devotion and pursue a Cold Scent but only call'd in as an Assistant to the Worship then the Song would end where the Inspiration ceases the whole Composure would be of a Piece all Meridian Light and Meridian Fervor And the same Pious Flame would be propagated and kept glowing in the Heart of him that reads Some of the shorter Odes of the two Poets now mentioned and a few of the Reverend Mr  Norris  's Essays in Verse are convincing Instances of the Success of this Proposal  'Tis my Opinion also that the free and unconfin'd Measures of  Pindar  would best maintain the Dignity of the Theme as well as give a loose to the Devout Soul nor check the Raptures of her Faith and Love Tho' in my feeble Attempts of this kind I have most unhappily fetter'd my Thoughts in the narrow Numbers of our Old PsalmTranslators I have contracted and cramp't the Sense or render'd it obscure and feeble by the too speedy and regular returns of Rhime  If my Friends expect a particular account of this or any other Circumstance relating to what I here Publish they will be pleas'd to accept of this short one  The TITLE  Assures them that Poesy is not the Business of my Life and if I seized those Hours of Leisure wherein my Soul was in a more sprightly and tuneful Frame to entertain them or my self with a Divine or Moral Song I hope I shall find an Easy Pardon  The SONGS Sacred to DEVOTION  Were never written with a design to appear before the Judges of Wit but only to assist the Meditations and Worship of Vulgar Christians to whom the Measures of  Hopkins  by Custom are grown Familiar and Natural and esteemed almost Sacred by being bound up in the same Volume with Scripture These are but a small part of two hundred Hymns of the same kind which are ready for Public Use if the World receive favourably what I now present The Reason that sent these out first and divided them from their Fellows is that in most of These there are some Expressions which are not suited to the plainest Capacities and differ too much from the usual  Methods of Speech in which Holy Things are propos'd to the general Part of Mankind  The ODES to VERTUE  c  Were form'd when the Frame and Humour of my Soul was just suited to the Subject of my Verse The Image of my Heart is painted in them and if they meet with a Reader whose Soul is akin to mine perhaps they may agreeably entertain him The Dullness of the Fancy and Coarseness of Expression will disappear the sameness of the Humour will create a Pleasure and insensibly overcome and conceal the Defects of the Muse  The IMITATIONS  Of that Noblest  Latin  Poet of Modern Ages  Casimire Sarbiewski  of  Poland  would need no Excuse did they but arise to the Beauty of the Original I have often taken the Freedom to add ten or twenty Lines or to leave out as many that I might suit my Song more to my own Design or because I found it Impossible to present the Force the Fineness and  the Fire of his Expression in our Language I wish some  English  Pen would import some of the Treasures of that rich Genius and bless our Nation  The INSCRIPTIONS  To particular Friends are warranted and defended by the Practise of the two best  Lyric  Writers  Horace  and  Casimire  And tho' the Authority of the first be more Venerable yet if in some Instances I prefer the latter I pray the Criticks to forgive me and I hope my Friends will excuse the Freedom of the Address  In the POEMS of HEROIC Measure  I have attempted in Rhime the same variety of Cadence Comma and Period which Blank Verse Glories in as its peculiar Elegance and Ornament  In the PINDARIQUES  I have generally conformed my Lines to the shorter Size of the Ancients and avoided to imitate the Excessive Lengths to which some Modern Writers have stretched their Sentences and especially the concluding Verse In these the Ear is the truest Judge nor was it made to be enslav'd to any precise Model of Elder or Later Times  After all I must petition my Reader to lay aside the sowr and sullen Air of Criticism and to assume the Friend Let him come with a design to be entertain'd and pleas'd rather than to seek his own Disgust and Aversion which will not be hard to find I am not so Vain as to think there are no Faults nor so Blind as to espy none There is not one Copy that intirely pleases me The best of them sinks vastly below the Idea which I form of a Divine or Moral Ode He that deals in the Mysteries of Heaven or of the Muses should be a Genius of no Vulgar Mould and as the Name of  Vates  belongs to both so the Furniture of Both is compriz'd in that Line of  Horace    Cui Mens Divinior atque Os  Magna Locuturum  But what  Juvenal  spake in his Age abides true in ours A compleat Poet or a Prophet is such an one  Qualem nequeo monstrare sentio tant√πm  Perhaps neither of these Characters in Perfection shall ever be seen on Earth till the Seventh Angel has sounded his Awful Trumpet till the Victory be compleat over the Beast and his Image when the Natives of Heaven shall joyn in Triumphal Consort with Prophets and Tuneful Saints and Sing unto their Golden Harps  Salvation Honour and Glory to him that sits upon the Throne and to the Lamb for ever  A TABLE OF THE

Whilst little Notes and feeble Song  Attempt th' Eternal Pow'r  II  Life Death and Hell and Worlds unknown  Hang on thy firm Decree  Thou sit'st on no precarious Throne  Nor Borrowest leave to Be  III  Thy Sovereign Voice bids ancient Night  Her Spacious Realms resign  And Lo ten Thousand Globes of Light  In Fields of Azure shine  IV  Thy Wisdom with Superiour Sway  Guides this vast moving Frame  Whilst all the Ranks of Being pay  Deep Reverence to thy Name  V  Vengeance attends t' obey thy Frown  And Blessings wait thy Smile  A Wreath of Lightning arms thy Crown  But Love adorns it still  VI  Unnumber'd Wonders in thee meet  And various Glory shines  The Crossing Rays too fiercely beat  Upon our fainting Minds  VII  Angels are lost in sweet Surprize  If thou unvail thy Grace  And humble Awe runs thro' the Skies  When Wrath arrays thy Face  VIII  When Mercy joyns with Majesty  To spread their Beams abroad  Not all the fairest Minds on high  Are Shadows of a God  IX  Thy Mighty Works Great  Gabriel  Sings  In a too feeble Strain  And labours upon all his Strings  To reach thy Thoughts in vain  X  Created Powers how weak they be  How short our Praises fall  So much akin to Nothing We  And Thou th' Eternal All  THE Transcendent Glories OF THE DEITY  I  GOD is a Name my Soul adores  Th' Almighty Three th' Eternal One  Nature and Grace with all their Powers  Confess the Infinite Unknown  II  From thy Great Self thy Being Springs  Thou art thine own Original  Made up of Uncreated Things  And SelfSufficience bears them all  III  Thy Voice hath form'd the Seas and Spheres  Bid the Waves roar and Planets shine  But Nothing like thy Self appears  Thro' all these Spacious Works of thine  IV  Still rolling Nature dies and grows  From Change to Change the Creatures run  Thy Being no Succession knows  And all thy vast Designs are One  V  A Glance of thine runs thro' the Globes  Rules the Bright Worlds and moves their Frame  Broad Sheets of Light compose thy Robes  Thy Guards are form'd of living Flame  VI  Thrones and Dominions round thee fall  And Worship in Submissive Forms  Thy Presence shakes this lower Ball  This little Dwelling Place of Worms  VII  Then how shall trembling Mortals dare  To sing thy Glory or thy Grace  Beneath thy Feet we lie so far  And see but Shadows of thy Face  VIII  Who can behold the Blazing Light  Who can approach Consuming Flame  None but thy Wisdom knows thy Might  None but thy Word can speak thy Name  GOD Appears most Glorious IN OUR Salvation by CHRIST  I  FAther how wide thy Glory shines  How high thy Wonders rise  Known

The Triumph of his Groans  VIII  Now the full Glories of the Lamb  Adorn the Heavenly Plains  And the Young Cherubs learn his Name  And try their choicest Strains  IX  O may I bear some humble Part

Pillars to prop our Sinking Land  Or Guardian Rocks to break the Seas  II  From Pole to Pole thy Name is known  Thee a Whole Heaven of Angels praise  Our Laboring Tongues would strike thy Throne  With the Loud Triumphs of thy Grace  III  Part of thy Church by thy Command  Stands rais'd upon the  Brittish  Isles  There said the Lord to Ages stand  Firm as the Everlasting Hills  IV  In vain the  Spanish  Ocean roar'd  And roll'd its Billows to our Shore  The Billows sunk beneath thy Word  And all the Floating War they bore  V  Come said the Sons of bloody  Rome    Let us provide new Arms from Hell  And down they digg'd thro' Earth's dark Womb  And ransack'd all the burning Cell  VI  Old  Satan  lent them fiery Stores  Infernal Coal and Sulph'rous Flame  And all that burns and all that roars  Outrageous Fires of dreadful Name  VII  Beneath the Senate and the Throne  Engines of Hellish Thunder lay  There the dark Seeds of Fire were sown  To spring a Bright but dismal Day  VIII  Thy Love beheld the black Design  Thy Love that Guards thine  England  round  Strange how it quench'd the fiery Mine  And crush'd the Tempest under Ground  THE Second Part  I  ASsume my Tongue a Nobler Strain  Sing the New Wonders of the Lord  The Foes revive their Pow'rs again  Again they die beneath his Sword  II  Dark as our Thoughts our Minutes roll  While Tyranny possest the Throne  And Murtherers of an  Irish  Soul  Ran threatning Death thro' every Town  III  The  Roman  Priest and  Brittish  Prince  Joyn'd their best Force and blackest Charms  And the fierce Troops of neighbouring  France  Offer'd the Service of their Arms  IV  'Tis done they cry'd and laught aloud  The Courts of Darkness rang with Joy  Th' Old Serpent hiss'd and Hell grew proud  While  Zion  mourn'd her Ruine nigh  V  But lo The great Deliverer Sails  Commission'd from  Jehovah  's Hand  And Smiling Seas and wishing Gales  Convey him to the longing Land  VI  The happy Day and happy Year  Nov  Both in our new Salvation meet  The Day that quencht the Burning Snare  Nov  And Year that burnt th' Invading Fleet    VII  Now did thine Arm O God of Hosts  Now did thine Arm shine dazling bright  The Sons of Might their Hands had lost  And Men of Blood forgot to fight  VIII  Brigades of Angels lin'd the way  And guarded  William  to his Throne  There ye Celestial Warriours stay  And make his Palace like your own  IX  Thus Mighty God thy Praise Divine  From Heaven and Earth at once shall flow  Angels and Men conspire and joyn  In  Hallelujahs  here below  X  All  Hallelujah  Heavenly King  Tis thy Victorious Arm we sing  Fly round the Globe ye Ecchoing Joys  And vaulted Skies repeat the Noise  GOD Incomprehensible  I  FAR in the Heav'ns my God retires  My God the point of my Desires  And hides his Lovely Face  When he descends within my View  He charms my Reason to pursue  But leaves it tir'd and fainting in th' unequal Chase  II  Or if I reach unusual height  Till near his Presence brought  There Floods of Glory check my Flight  Cramp the bold Pinions of my Wit  And all untune my Thought  Plung'd in a Sea of Light I roll  Where Wisdom Justice Mercy Shines  Infinite Rays in Crossing Lines  Beat thick Confusion on my Sight and overwhelm my Soul  III  Come to my aid ye FellowMinds  And help me reach the Throne  What single Strength in vain designs  United Force hath done  Thus Worms may Joyn and grasp the Poles  Thus Atoms fill the Sea  But the whole Race of CreatureSouls  Stretch'd to their last extent of Thought plunge and are lost in Thee  IV  Great God behold my Reason lies  Adoring yet my Love would rise  On Pinions not her own  Faith shall direct her humble Flight  Thro' all the trackless Seas of Light  To Thee th' Eternal Fair the Infinite Unknown  SICKNESS GIVES A Sight of HEAVEN  I  OFT have I sat in Secret Sighs  To feel my Flesh decay  Then groan'd aloud with frighted Eyes  To view this tott'ring Clay  II  But I forbid my Sorrows now  Nor dares the Flesh complain  Diseases bring their Profit too  The Joy o'recomes the Pain  III  My chearful Soul now all the Day  Sits waiting here and Sings  Looks thro' the Ruins of her Clay  And practises her Wings  IV  Faith almost changes into Sight  While from afar she Spies  Her fair Inheritance in Light  Above created Skies  V  Had but the PrisonWalls been strong  And firm without a flaw  In Darkness she had dwelt too long  And less of Glory saw  VI  But now the Everlasting Hills  Thro' every Chink appear  And something of the Joy she feels  While she's a Pris'ner here  VII  The Shines of Heaven rush sweetly in  At all the Gaping Flaws  Visions of Endless Bliss are seen  And Native Air she draws  VIII  O may these Walls stand tott'ring still  The Breaches never close  If I must here in Darkness dwell  And all this Glory lose  IX  Or rather let this Flesh decay  The Ruins wider grow  Till glad to see the Enlarged way  I stretch my Pinions thro'  THE Universal Hallelujah OR PSALM PARAPHRAS'D  I  PRAISE ye the Lord each Heavenly Tongue  That sits around his Throne  Jesus  the Man shall lead the Song  The God inspire the Tune  II  Gabriel  and all th' Immortal Quire  That fill the Realms above  Sing for the form'd you of his Fire  And feeds you with his Love  III  Shine to his Praise ye Chrystal Skies  The Floor of his Abode  Or vail your little twinkling Eyes  Before a brighter God  IV  Thou rolling Globe of Golden Light  Whose Beams Create our Days  Joyn with the Silver Queen of Night  To own your borrow'd Rays  V  Blush and refund the Honours paid  To your inferiour Names  Tell the blind World your Orbs are fed  By his O'reflowing Flames  VI  Winds ye shall bear his Name aloud  Thro' the Ethereal Blue  For when His Chariot is a Cloud  He makes his Wheels of you  VII  Thunder and Hail and Fires and Storms  The Troops of his Command  Appear in all your Dreadful Forms  And speak his awful Hand  VIII  Shout to the Lord ye Surging Seas  In your Eternal Roar  Let Wave to Wave resound his Praise  And Shore reply to Shore  IX  While Monsters rolling on the Flood  In Scaly Silver shine  Speak terribly their MakerGod  And lash the foaming Brine  X  But Gentler Things shall tune his Name  To softer Notes than these  Young  Zephyrs  breathing o're the Stream  Or whispering thro' the Trees  XI  Wave your tall Heads ye lofty Pines  To him that bid you grow  Sweet Clusters bend the fruitful Vines  On every Thankful Bough  XII  Let the shrill Birds his Honour raise  And tune it in the Sky  While groveling Beasts attempt his Praise  With hoarser Harmony  XIII  Thus while the meaner Creatures sing  Ye Mortals take the Sound  Eccho the Glories of your King  Thro' all the Nations round  XIV  Th' Eternal Name must fly abroad  From  England  to  Japan    And the whole Race shall bow to God  That owns the Name of Man  THE Love of CHRIST ON His CROSS AND On His THRONE  I  NOW let my Faith grow strong and rise  And view my Lord in all his Love  Look back to hear his Dying Cries  Then mount and see his Throne above  II  See where he Languish'd on the Cross  Beneath my Sins he groan'd and dy'd  See where he fits to plead my Cause  By his Almighty Father's Side  III  If I behold his Bleeding Heart  There Love in Floods of Sorrow reigns  He triumphs o're the Killing Smart  And buys my Pleasure with his Pains  IV  Or if I climb th' Eternal Hills  Where the dear Conqueror sits enthron'd  Still in his Heart Compassion dwells  Near the Memorials of his Wound  V  How shall a pardon'd Rebel show  How much I Love my Dying God  Lord here I banish every Foe  I hate the Sins that Cost thy Blood  VI  I hold no more Commerce with Hell  My dearest Lusts shall all depart  But let thine Image ever dwell  Stampt as a Seal upon my Heart  DEATH A Welcome Messenger  I  LORD when we see a Saint of thine  Lie gasping out his Breath  With Longing Eyes and Looks Divine  Smiling and pleas'd in Death  II  How we could e'en contend to lay  Our Limbs upon that Bed  And ask thine Envoy to convey  Our Spirits in his stead  III  Our Souls are rising on the Wing  To venture in his Place  For when grim Death has lost his Sting  He has an Angels Face  IV  Jesus  then purge my Crimes away  'Tis Guilt creates my Fears  'Tis Guilt gives Death its fierce Array  And all the Arms it bears  V  Oh if my threatning Sins were gone  And Death had lost his Sting  I could invite the Angel on  And chide his lazy Wing  VI  Away these interposing Days  And let the Lovers meet  The Angel has a cold Embrace  But kind and soft and sweet  VII  I'de leap at once my Seventy Years  And fly into his Arms  And  and all my Cares  eavenly Charms  VIII  Joyful I'd lay this Body down  And leave the lifeless Clay  Without a Sigh without a Groan  And Stretch and soar away  Sincere Praise  I  ALmighty Maker God  How wondrous is thy Name  Thy Glories how diffus'd abroad  Thro' the Creations Frame  II  Nature in every Dress  Her humble Homage Pays  And takes a Thousand Ways t' express  Thine Undissembled Praise  III  In Native White and Red  The Rose and Lilly stand  And free from Pride their Beauties spread  To show thy skilful Hand  IV  The Lark mounts up the Sky  With Unambitious Song  And bears her Maker's Praise on high  Upon her Artless Tongue  V  My Soul would rise and Sing  To her Creator too  Fain would my Tongue adore my King  And Pay the Worship due  VI  But Pride that busie Sin  Spoils all that I perform  Curs'd Pride that creeps securely in  And swells a haughty Worm  VII  Thy Glories I abate  Or praise thee with Design  Some of thy Favours I forget  Or would have something mine  VIII  The very Songs I frame  Are Faithless to thy Cause  And steal the Honours of thy Name  Unto their own Applause  IX  Create my Soul anew  Else all my Worship's vain  This wretched Heart will ne'er be true  Until 'tis form'd again  X  Descend Celestial Fire  And seize me from above  Melt me in Flames of pure Desire  A Sacrifice to Love  XI  Let Joy and Worship spend  The Remnant of my Days  And to my God my Soul ascend  In sweet Perfumes of Praise  GOD's Infinity  I  SOME Seraph lend your Heavenly Tongue  Or Harp of Golden String  That I may raise a lofty Song  To our Eternal King  II  Thy Names how Infinite they be  Great Everlasting One  Boundless thy Might and Majesty  And Unconfin'd thy Throne  III  Thy Glories shine of Wondrous Size  And wondrous Large thy Grace  Immortal Day breaks from thine Eyes  And  Gabriel  Vails his Face  IV  Thine Essence is a vast Abyss  Which Angels cannot sound  An Ocean of Infinities  Where all our thoughts are drownd  V  The Mysteries of Creation lie  Beneath Enlightned Minds  Thoughts can ascend above the Sky  And fly before the Winds  VI  Reason may grasp the Massie Hills  And stretch from Pole to Pole  But Half thy Name our Spirit fills  And Overloads our Soul  VII  In vain our Haughty Reason swells  For Nothing's found in Thee  But Boundless Unconceivables  And Vast Eternity  LONGING FOR The Second Coming OF CHRIST  I  WHEN shall thy Shining Face be seen  When shall our Eyes behold our God  What lengths of Distance lie between  And Hills of Guilt a Heavy Load  II  Our Months are Ages of Delay  And slowly every Minute wears  Fly winged Time and roll away  These tedious Rounds of Sluggish Years  III  Ye Heavenly Gates loose all your Chains  Let the Eternal Pillars bow  Dear Saviour Cleave the Starry Plains  And make the Chrystal Mountains flow  IV  Hark how thy Saints unite their Cries  And pray and wait the General Doom  Come thou the Soul of all our Joys  Thou the Desire of Nations come  V  Put thy bright Robes of Triumph on  And bless our Eyes and bless our Ears  Thou absent Love thou Dear Unknown  Thou Fairest of ten thousand Fairs  VI  Our Heartstrings groan with deep Complaint  Our Flesh lies panting Lord for thee  And every Limb and every Joynt  Stretches for Immortality  VII  Our Spirits shake their Eager Wings  And burn to meet thy rolling Throne  We rise away from Mortal things  To attend thy Shining Chariot down  VIII  Now let our Chearful Eyes survey  The blazing Earth and melting Hills  And smile to see the Lightnings play  And flash along before thy Wheels  IX  O for a shout of Violent Joys  To Joyn the Trumpets thundring sound  The Angel Herald shakes the Skies  Awakes the Graves and tears the Ground  X  Ye Slumbring Saints a Heavenly Host  Stands waiting at your gaping Tombs  Let every Sacred Sleeping Dust  Leap into Life for  Jesus  comes  XI  Jesus  the God of Might and Love  New moulds our Limbs of Cumbrous Clay  Quick as Seraphick Flames we move  Active and Young and Fair as they  XII  Our airy Feet with unknown flight  Swift as the motions of Desire  Run up the Hills of Heavenly Light  And leave the Weltring World in Fire  THE Sufferings and Glories OF CHRIST  A SONG  In Trisyllable Feet    I  I Long for a Consort of Heavenly Praise  To  Jesus  the God the Omnipotent Son  My Voice should awake in Harmonious Lays  Could it tell half the Wonders that  Jesus  has done  II  I would sing how he left his own Palace of Light  And Robes made of Glory that dress'd him above  Yet pleas'd with his Journey and swift was his Flight  For he rode on the Pinions of Infinite Love  III  Far down to the Place of our distant Abode  He came we adore him to raise us on high  He came to attone the Revenge of a God  And he took up a Life to be able to die  IV  All Hell and its Lyons stood Roaring around  His Flesh and his Spirit with Malice they tore  While Worlds of Sorrow lay pressing him down  As vast as the Burden of Sins that he bore  V  Fast bound in the Chains of Imperious Death  The Infinite Captive a Prisoner lay  The Infinite Captive arose from the Earth  And leap't to the Hills of Ethereal Day  VI  Then mention no more of the Wrath of a God  Of the Lyons of Hell and their Roarings no more  We lift up our Eyes to his Shining Abode  And our loudest  Hosannahs  his Name shall adore  VII  We crown the Triumpher with the Honours he won  Hosannah  thro' all the Coelestial Groves  The God and the Man how he fills up his Throne  How He sits how He shines how He looks how He Loves  VIII  O happy ye Heavens and happy ye Hills  Where he treads with his Feet and diffuseth his Grace  While Mercy and Majesty Glories and Smiles  Play gently around the sweet Air of his Face  IX  Amongst a  Choir of Archangels and Songs  The Mighty Redeemer Eternally reigns  And the Sound of his Name from a Million of Tongues  Flies o're the bright Mountains and blesses the Plains  THE Day of Judgment  An ODE Attempted in  English Sapphick    I  WHEN the Fierce Northwind with his Airy Forces  Rears up the  Baltick  to a foaming Fury  And the red Lightning with a Storm of Hail comes  Rushing amain down  II  How the poor Sailers stand amaz'd and tremble  While the hoarse Thunder like a Bloody Trumpet  Roars a loud onset to the gaping Waters  Quick to devour them  III  Such shall the Noise be and the Wild disorder  If things Eternal may be like these Earthly  Such the dire Terror when the great Archangel  Shakes the Creation  IV  Tears the strong Pillars of the Vault of Heaven  Breaks up old Marble the Repose of Princes  See the Graves open and the Bones arising  Flames all around 'em  V  Hark the shrill Outcries of the Guilty Wretches  Lively bright Horror and amazing Anguish  Stare thro' their Eyelids while the living Worm lies  Gnawing within them  VI  Thoughts like old Vultures prey upun their Heartstrings  And the smart twinges when their Eye beholds the  Lofty Judge frowning and a Flood of Vengeance  Rolling afore him  VII  Hopeless Immortals how they scream and shiver  While Devils push them to the Pit wide Yawning  Hideous and gloomy to receive them headlong  Down to the Centre  VIII  Stop here my Fancy All away ye horrid  Doleful Ideas Come arise to  Jesus    How he sits Godlike And the Saints around him  Thron'd and adoring  IX  O may I sit there when he comes Triumphant  Dooming the Nations Then arise to Glory  While our  Hosannahs  all along the Passage  Shout the Redeemer  Confession and Pardon  I  ALAS my aking Heart  Here the keen Torment lies  It racks my waking Hours with Smart  And frights my Slumbring Eyes  II  Guilt will be hid no more  My Griefs take vent apace  The Crimes that blot my Conscience o're  Flush Crimson in my Face  III  My Sorrows like a Flood  Impatient of Restraint  Into thy Bosom O my God  Pour out a long Complaint  IV  This impious Heart of mine  Could once defie the Lord  Could rush with Violence on to Sin  In presence of thy Sword  V  As often have I stood  A Rebel to the Skies  The Calls the Tenders of a God  And Mercies Loudest cries  VI  He offers all his Grace  And all his Heaven to me  Offers But 'tis to senseless Brass  That can nor feel nor see  VII  Jesus  the Saviour stands  To court me from above  And looks and spreads his wounded Hands  And shows the Prints of Love  VIII  But I a stupid Fool  How long have I withstood  The Blessings purchas'd with his Soul  And paid for all in Blood  IX  The Heav'nly Dove came down  And tender'd me his Wings  To mount me upward to a Crown  And bright Immortal things  X  Lord I'm asham'd to say  That I refus'd thy Dove  And sent thy Spirit griev'd away  To his own Realms of Love  XI  Nor all thine Heav'nly Charms  Nor thy revenging Hand  Could force me to lay down my Arms  And bow to thy Command  XII  Lord 'tis against thy Face  My Sins like Arrows rise  And yet and yet O matchless Grace  Thy Thunder silent lies  XIII  O shall I never feel  The Meltings of thy Love  Am I of such Hellharden'd Steel  That Mercy cannot move  XIV  Now for one powerful Glance  Dear Saviour from thy Face  This Rebelheart no more withstands  But sinks beneath thy Grace  XV  O'recome by dying Love I fall  And at thy Cross I lie  I throw my Flesh my Soul my All  And Weep and Love and Die  XVI  "Rise says the Prince of Mercy rise  With Joy and Pity in his Eyes  "Rise and behold my wounded Veins  "Here flows the Blood to wash thy Stains  XVII  "See my Great Father's reconcil'd  He say'd and Lo the Father smil'd  The Joyful Cherubs clapt their Wings  And sounded Grace on all their Strings  JESUS THE Only SAVIOUR  I  ADAM  our Head our Father fell  And Justice doom'd the Race to Hell  The fiery Law speaks all Despair  There's no Reprieve nor Pardon there  II  Call a bright Council in the Skies  "Seraphs the Mighty and the Wise  "Say what Expedient can you give  "That Sin be damn'd and Sinners live  III  "Speak are you strong to bear the Load  "The weighty Vengeance of a God  "Which of you loves our wretched Race  "Or dares to venture in our Place  IV  In vain we ask For all around  Stands Silence thro' the Heavenly Ground  There's not a glorious Mind above  Has half the Strength or half the Love  V  But O unutterable Grace  Th' Eternal Son takes  Adam  's place  Down to our World the Saviour flies  Stretches his naked Arms and Dies  VI  Justice was pleas'd to bruise the God  And pay its Wrongs with Heavenly Blood  Infinite Racks and Pangs He bore  And rose The Law could ask no more  VII  Amazing Work Look down ye Skies  Wonder and gaze with all your Eyes  Ye Heavenly Thrones stoop from above  And bow to this Mysterious Love  VIII  See how they bend See how they look  Long they had read th' Eternal Book  And study'd dark Decrees in vain  The Cross and  Calvary  makes them plain  IX  Now they are struck with deep Amaze  Each with his Wings conceals his Face  Now clap their sounding Plumes and cry  "The Wisdom of a Diety  X  Low they adore th' Incarnate Son  And sing the Glories he hath won  Sing how he broke our Iron Chains  How deep he sunk how high he reigns  XI  Triumph and reign Victorious Lord  By all thy flaming Saints ador'd  And say dear Conqueror say how long  'Ere we shall fly to joyn their Song  XII  Lo from afar the promis'd Day  Shines with a welldistinguish'd Ray  But my wing'd Passion hardly bears  These tedious Rounds of rolling Years  XIII  Send down a Chariot from above  With fiery Wheels and pav'd with Love  Raise me beyond th' Ethereal Blue  To Sing and Love as Angels do  A Song of Praise TO GOD  PSALM C  In Trissyllable Feet  I  SIng aloud to the Lord Let the two Frozen Poles  Awake to the Song and dissolve in the Praise  At the Fiery Line will we kindle our Souls  Nor the Worship be quench't by the Western Seas  II  Come Nations adoring the Infinite King  With Zeal in your Bosoms and Joy in your Eyes  His Wonderful Name should eternally ring  Round the broad Globe of Earth to the Circling Skies  III  'Twas he that gave Life to our Souls with a Breath  He fashion'd our Clay to the Figure of Men  And when we had stray'd to the Regions of Death  He reduc'd his own Sheep to his Pastures again  IV  We enter his Gates with  Hosannahs  and Songs  The Arches resound with the Notes that we raise  Thus while our Devotions are paid with our Tongues  Thy Temple adores by repeating the Praise  V  Thy Power shakes the World and makes it self known  Thy Love like Eternity has ne're a Bound  The Truth of our God must stand firm as his Throne  When the Wheels of old Time shall cease to go round  An Essay on a few of  DAVID  's  PSALMS  Translated into Plain Verse in Language more agreeable to the clearer Revelations of the Gospel  THE HAPPY SAINT AND Cursed Sinner  PSALM I  I  BLEST is the Man whose cautious Feet  Shun the broad Path which Sinners chuse  Who hates the House where Atheists meet  And dreads the Words that Scoffers use  II  He loves t' employ his Morning Light  Reading the Statutes of the Lord  And spends the wakeful Hours of Night  With Pleasure pond'ring o're the Word  III  He like a Plant by gentle Streams  Shall Flourish in Immortal Green  And Heav'n will shine with Kindest Beams  On every Work his Hands begin  IV  But Sinners find their Counsels cross'd  As Chaff before the Tempest flies  So shall their Hopes be blown and lost  When the last Trumpet shakes the Skies  V  In vain the Rebel crouds to stand  In Judgment with the Pious Race  The dreadful Judge with Stern Command  Divides him to a different Place  VI  "Strait is the Way my Saints have trod  "I blest the Path and drew it plain  "But you would chuse the crooked Road  "And it leads down t' Eternal Pain  Doubts and Fears SUPPRES'D  PSALM III  I  LOOK Gracious God how numerous they  Whose envious Power and Rage  Conspiring my Eternal Death  Against my Soul engage  II  The lying Tempter would perswade  There's no Relief in Heaven  And all my swelling Sins appear  Too big to be forgiven  III  But God my Glory and my Strength  Shall tread the Tempter down  And drown my Sins beneath the Blood  Of his Dear Dying Son  IV  I cry'd and from his Sacred Hill  He bow'd a list'ning Ear  I call'd my Father and my God  And he dispers'd my Fear  V  He threw soft Slumbers on mine Eyes  In sight of all my Foes  I 'woke and wondred at the Grace  That guarded my Repose  VI  What tho' the Hosts of Death and Hell  All arm'd against me stood  Terrors no more shall shake my Soul  Nor Tremblings chill my Blood  VII  Lord I adore thy Wondrous Love  And thy Salvation sing  My God hath broke the Serpents Teeth  And Death has lost his Sting  VIII  Salvation to the Lord belongs  The Lord alone can save  Blessings attend thy People here  And reach beyond the Grave  Praise to the LORD FROM All NATIONS  PSALM C  I  SING to the Lord with Joyful Voice  Let every Land his Name adore  The  Brittish  Isles shall send the Noise  Across the Ocean to the Shore  II  With gladness bow before his Throne  And let his Presence raise your Joys  Know that the Lord is God alone  And form'd our Souls and fram'd our Voice  III  Infinite Power without our aid  Figur'd our Clay to humane Mould  And when our Wandring Feet had stray'd  He brought us to his Sacred Fold  IV  Enter his Gates with Thankful Songs  Thro' his Wide Courts your Voices raise  Almighty God our Joyful Tongues  Shall fill thine house with sounding Praise  V  Wide as the World is thy Command  Vast as Eternity thy Love  Firm as a Rock thy Truth must stand  When rolling Years shall cease to move  Brotherly Love  PSALM CXXXIII  I  LO what an entertaining Sight  Are Brethren that agree  Brethren whose chearful Hearts unite  In Bands of Piety  II  When Streams of Love from Christ the Spring  Descend to every Soul  And Sacred Peace with Balmy Wing  Shades and bedews the whole  III  'Tis like the Oyl on  Aaron  shed  Which choice Perfumes compose  Down softly from his Reverend Head  It trickled to his Toes  IV  Tis pleasant as the Morning Dews  That fall on  Zion  's Hill  Where God his mildest Glory shews  And makes his Grace distil  THE PLEASURE OF Love to CHRIST Present or Absent  I  OF all the Joys we Mortals know  Jesus  thy Love exceeds the rest  Love the best Blessing here below  And nearest Image of the Blest  II  Sweet are my Thoughts and soft my Cares  When the dear Heav'nly Flame I feel  all my Hopes and all my Fears  There's something kind and pleasing still  III  While I am held in his Embrace  There's not a Thought attempts to rove  Each Smile he wears upon his Face  Fixes and charms and fires my Love  IV  He speaks and strait Immortal Joys  Run thro' my Ears and reach my Heart  My Soul all melts at that dear Voice  And Pleasure shoots thro' every Part  V  If he withdraw a Moments space  He leaves a Sacred Pledge behind  Here in this Breast his Image stays  The Grief and Comfort of my Mind  VI  While of his Absence I complain  And long and weep as Lovers do  There's a strange Pleasure in the Pain  And Tears have their own Sweetness too  VII  When round his Courts by Day I rove  Or ask the Watchmen of the Night  For some kind Tidings of my Love  His very Name creates Delight  VIII  Jesus  my God yet rather come  Mine Eyes would dwell upon thy Face  'Tis best to see my Lord at Home  And feel the Presence of his Grace  The Substance of the following Copy and many of the Lines as they here stand were sent me by an Esteemed Friend Mr  W Nokes  with a desire that I would form them into a Pindarick Ode but I retain'd his Measures least I should too much alter his Sense  A Sight of CHRIST  ANgels of Light your God and King surround  With Noble Songs in his Exalted Flesh  He claims your Worship while his Saints on Earth  Bless their RedeemerGod with humble Tongues  Angels with lofty Honours crown his Head  We bowing at his Feet by Faith may feel  This distant Influence and confess his Love  Once I beheld his Face when Beams Divine  Broke from his Eyelids and unusual Light  Wrap't me at once in Glory and Surprize  My Joyful Heart high leaping in my Breast  With Transport cry'd  This is the Christ of God    Then threw my Arms around in sweet Embrace  And clasp'd and bow'd Adoring low till I was lost in him  While he appears no other Charms can hold  Or draw my Soul asham'd of former things  Which no Remembrance now deserve or Name  Tho' with Contempt best in Oblivion hid  But the bright Shine and Presence soon withdrew  I sought him whom I Love but found him not  I felt his Absence and with strongest cries  Proclaim'd  Where  Jesus  is not    all is vain  Whether I hold him with a full Delight  Or seek him panting with Extream Desire  'Tis He alone can please my Wondring Soul  To hold or seek him is my only Choice  If he refrain on me to cast his Eye  Down from his Palace nor my longing Soul  With upward Look can spy my Dearest Lord  Thro' his Blue Pavement I'll behold him still  With sweet reflection on the peaceful Cross  All in his Blood and Anguish groaning deep  Gasping and dying there  This Sight I ne're can loose by it I live  A Quickning Vertue from his Death inspir'd  Is Life and Breath to me His Flesh my Food  His Vital Blood I drink and hence my Strength  I Live I'm Strong and now Eternal Life  Beats quick within my Breast my Vigorous Mind  Spurns the dull Earth and on her fiery Wings  Reaches the Mount of Purposes Divine  Counsels of Peace betwixt th' Almighty Three  Conceiv'd at once and Sign'd without Debate  In perfect Union of the Eternal Mind  With vast Amaze I see the Unfathom'd Thoughts  Infinite Schemes and Infinite Designs  Of God's own Heart in which he ever rests  Eternity lies open to my View  Here the Beginning and the End of all  I can discover Christ the End of all  And Christ the great Beginning He my Head  My God my Glory and my All in All  O that the Day the joyful Day were come  When the first  Adam  from his Ancient Dust  Crown'd with new Honours shall revive and see  Jesus  his Son and Lord while shouting Saints  Surround their King and God's Eternal Son  Shines in the midst but with Superior Beams  And like himself Then the Mysterious Word  Long hid behind the Letter shall appear  All Spirit and Life and in the fullest Light  Stand forth to publick View and there disclose  His Father's Sacred Works and wondrous Ways  Then Wisdom Righteousness and Grace Divine  Thro' all the Infinite Transactions past  Inwrought and shining shall with double blaze  Strike our astonish't Eyes and ever reign  Admir'd and Glorious in Triumphant Light  Death and the Tempter and the Man of Sin  Now at the Bar arraign'd in Judgment cast  Shall vex the Saints no more but perfect Love  And loudest Praises perfect Joy create  While evercircling Years maintain the blissful State  LONGING FOR HEAVEN OR THE Song of Angels Above  I  EARTH has detain'd me Prisoner long  And I'me grown weary now  My Heart my Hand my Ear my Tongue  There's nothing here for you  II  Tir'd in my Thoughts I stretch me down  And upward glance mine Eyes  Upward my Father to thy Throne  And to my Native Skies  III  There the dear Man my Saviour sits  The God how bright he shines  And scatters Infinite Delights  On all the happy Minds  IV  Seraphs with elevated Strains  Circle the Throne around  And Move and Charm the Starry Plains  With an Immortal Sound  V  Jesus  the Lord their Harps employs  Jesus  my Love they sing  Jesus  the Name of both our Joys  Sounds sweet from every String  VI  Hark how beyond the narrow Bounds  Of Time and Space they run  And speak in most Majestick Sounds  The Godhead of the Son  VII  How on the Father's Breast he lay  The darling of his Soul  Infinite Years before the Day  Or Heavens began to roll  VIII  And now they sink the lofty Tone  And milder Notes they play  And bring th' Eternal Godhead down  To dwell in humble Clay  IX  O the dear Beauties of that Man  The God resides within  His Flesh all pure without a Stain  His Soul without a Sin  X  Then how he look't and how he smild  What wondrous things he said  Sweet Cherubs stay dwell here a while  And tell what  Jesus  did  XI  At his Command the Blind awake  And feel the gladsome Rays  He bids the Dumb attempt to speak  They try their Tongues in Praise  XII  He shed a thousand Blessings round  Where 'ere he turn'd his Eye  He spake and at the Sovereign Sound  The Hellish Legions fly  XIII  Thus while with unambitious Strife  Th' Ethereal Minstrels rove  Thro' all the Labours of his Life  And Wonders of his Love  XIV  In the full Quire a broken String  Groans with a strange Surprize  The rest in silence mourn their King  That Bleeds and Loves and Dies  XV  The little Saints with dropping Wings  Cease their harmonious Breath  No blooming Trees nor bubbling Springs  While  Jesus  sleeps in Death  XVI  Then all at once to living Strains  They summon every Chord  Break up the Tomb and burst his Chains  And show their rising Lord  XVII  Around the flaming Army throngs  To guard him to the Skies  With loud  Hosannahs  on their Tongues  And Triumph in their Eyes  XVIII  In awful State the Conquering God  Ascends his shining Throne  While tuneful Angels sound abroad  The Vict'ries he has won  XIX  Now let me rise and Joyn their Song  And be an Angel too  My Heart my Hand my Ear my Tongue  Here's Joyful Work for you  XX  would begin the Musick here  And so my Soul should rise  Oh for some Heavenly Notes to bear  My Spirit to the Skies  XXI  There ye that love my Saviour sit  There I would fain have place  Amongst your Thrones or at your Feet  So I might see his Face  XXII  am confin'd to Earth no more  But mount in haste above  To bless the God that I adore  And sing the Man I Love  GOD Sovereign and Gracious  I  THE Lord how fearful is his Name  How wide is his Command  Nature with all its Mighty Frame  Lies rolling in his Hand  II  Immortal Glory forms his Throne  And Light his Awful Robe  Whilst with a Smile or with a Frown  He manages the Globe  III  A Word of His Almighty Breath  Can swell or sink the Seas  Build the vast Empires of the Earth  Or break 'em as he please  IV  Adoring Angels round him fall  In all their Shining Forms  His Sovereign Eye looks thro' them all  And pities Mortal Worms  V  His Bowels to our Worthless Race  In sweet Compassion move  He Cloaths his Looks with softest Grace  And takes his Title Love  VI  Now let the Lord for ever Reign  And Sway us as he will  Sick or in Health in Ease or Pain  We are his Favourites still  VII  No more shall peevish Passion rise  The Tongue no more Complain  'Tis Sovereign Love that lends our Joys  And Love resumes again  THE HAZARD OF Loving the Creatures  I  WHERE'ere my Flatt'ring Passions rove  I find a lurking Snare  'Tis dangerous to let loose our Love  Beneath th' Eternal Fair  II  Souls whom the Tye of Friendship binds  And Things that share our Blood  Seize a large Portion of our Minds  And leave the less for God  III  Nature hath soft but powerful Bands  And Reason She controuls  While Children with their little Hands  Hang closest to our Souls  IV  Thoughtless they act th' Old Serpent's Part  What tempting things they be  Lord how they twine about our Heart  And draw it off from thee  V  Our hasty Wills rush blindly on  Where rising Passion rolls  And thus we make our Fetters strong  To bind our Slavish Souls  VI  Dear Sovereign break these Fetters off  And set our Spirits free  God in himself is Bliss enough  For we have all in thee  Christ's Amazing Love AND My Amazing Coldness  I  COME let me Love or is my Mind  Harden'd to Stone or froze to Ice  I see the Blessed Fair One bend  And stoop t' embrace me from the Skies  II  O 'tis a Thought would melt a Rock  And make a Heart of Iron move  That those sweet Lips that Heavenly Look  Should seek my Kisses and my Love  III  I was a Traytor doom'd to Fire  Bound to sustain Immortal Pains  He flew on Wings of strong Desire  Assum'd my Guilt and took my Chains  IV  Infinite Grace Almighty Charms  Stand in Amaze ye rolling Skies  Jesus  the God with naked Arms  Hangs on a Cross of Love and Dies  V  Did Pity ever stoop so low  Drest in Divinity and Blood  Was ever Rebel courted so  In Groans of an Expiring God  VI  Again He lives and spreads his Hands  Hands that were nay l'd to tort'ring Smart  "By these dear Wounds says He and stands  And prays to clasp me to his Heart  VII  Sure I must Love or are my Ears  Still Deaf nor feel the Passion move  Then let me melt my Heart to Tears  And Die because I cannot Love  Wishing him ever with me  I  NOW be that smiling Moment blest  When First I saw my Love  Jesus  the Fairest and the Best  Of all the Forms above  A thousand Graces ever rise  And bloom upon his Face  A thousand Arrows from his Eyes  Shoot thro' my Heart with sweet Surprize  And stand to guard the Place  II  All Natures Art shall never cure  The Heavenly Pains I found  And 'tis beyond all Beauties Power  To make another Wound  Earthly Beauties grow and fade  Nature may heal the Wounds She made  But Charms so much Divine  Hold a long Empire of the Heart  What Heaven has joyn'd shall never part  And  Jesus  must be mine  III  In vain the envious Shades of Night  Or Flatteries of the Day  Would vail his Image from my Sight  Or tempt my Soul away  Jesus  is all my Waking Theme  His Lovely Form meets every Dream  And knows not to depart  The Passion reigns  Thro' all my Veins  And floating round the Crimson Stream  Still finds him at my Heart  IV  Dwell there for ever dwell my Love  Here I confine my Sence  Nor dare my Wildest Wishes rove  Nor stir a Thought from thence  Let me be lost in thine Embrace  As Rivers in the Sea  Or live Eternity of Days  To spend them all with thee  Still I would lie in those dear Arms  Dissolving still among thy Charms  And as the Moments fly  I'de Breathe away successive Souls  So Billow after Billow rolls  To kiss the Shoar and Dye  THE Absence of the Beloved  I  COME lead me to some lofty Shade  Where Turtles moan their Loves  Tall Shadows were for Lovers made  And Grief becomes the Groves  II  Tis no mean Beauty of the Ground  That has inslav'd mine Eyes  I faint beneath a Nobler Wound  Nor love below the Skies  III  Jesus  the Spring of all that's bright  The Everlasting Fair  Heavens Ornament and Heavens Delight  Is my Eternal Care  IV  But ah how far above this Grove  Does the dear Charmer dwell  Absence that keenest Wound to Love  That sharpest Pain I feel  V  Pensive I climb the Sacred Hills  And near him vent my Woes  Yet his sweet Face he still conceals  Yet still my Passion grows  VI  I murmur to the hollow Vale  I tell the Rocks my Flame  And bless the  Eccho  in her Cell  That best repeats his Name  VII  My Passion breaths perpetual Sighs  Till pitying Winds shall hear  And gently bear them up the Skies  And gently wound his Ear  Sick of Love  Solom Song i  I  TELL me thou Fairest of thy Kind  My Love my AllDivine  Where may this fainting Head reclin'd  Relieve such Cares as mine  Ye Shepheards Lead me to your Grove  If burning Noon Infect the Sky  The Sick'ning Sheep to Coverts fly  The Sheep not half so Scorch't as I  Thus Languishing in Love  II  Stretch't on the Flowry Shades along  There would I tune my Tender Song  And drop a Melting Tear  Musick has wondrous Charms they say  Musick can raging Heats allay  And Tame the wildest Care  Begin my Song the Soothing Strain  But the dear Flame is Charming Sweet  I would not cool the Passion yet  Nor can I bear the pain  Strangely I'm Rack't in wide Extreams  I burn I burn I burn and yet I Love the Flames  III  Oh why should Beauty Heavenly Bright  Stoop down to Charm a Mortals Sight  And Torture with the Sweet excess of Light  Our Hearts alas how frail their make  With their own weight of Joy they break  Oh why is Love so strong and Natures self so weak  IV  Dear Lord forgive my rash Complaint  And Love me still  Against my froward Will  Unvail thy Beauties tho' I faint  Send the great Herald from the Sky  And at the Trumpets awful roar  This feeble state of things shall fly  And Pain and Pleasure mix no more  Then I shall gaze with Strengthen'd Sight  On Glories Infinitely bright  My Heart shall all be Love my  Jesus  all Delight  Sitting in an Arbour  I  SWEET Muse descend and bless the Shade  And bless the Evening Grove  Business and Noise and Day are fled  And every Care but Love  II  But hence Ye Wanton Young and Fair  Mine is a purer Flame  No  Phillis  shall infect the Air  With her unhallowed Name  III  Jesus  has all my Powers possest  My Hopes my Fears my Joys  He the dear Sovereign of my Breast  Shall still command my Voice  IV  Some of the fairest Quires above  Shall flock around my Song  With Joy to hear the Name they Love  Sound from a Mortal Tongue  V  His Charms shall make my Numbers flow  And hold the falling Floods  While Silence sits on every Bough  And bends the List'ning Woods  VI  I'le carve our Passion on the Bark  And every wounded Tree  Shall drop and bear some Mystick Mark  That  Jesus  dy'd for me  VII  The Swains shall wonder when they read  Inscrib'd on all the Grove  That Heaven it Self came down and bled  To win a Mortals Love  BEWAILING My own Inconstancy  I  I LOVE the Lord but ah how far  My Thoughts from the dear Object are  This wanton Heart how wide it roves  And Fancy meets a Thousand Loves  II  my Soul burn to see my God  tread the Courts of his abode  But Troops of Rivals throng the place  And Tempt me off before his Face  III  Would I enjoy my Lord alone  bid my Passions all be gone  All but my Love and Charge my Will  To bar the Door and keep it still  IV  But Cares or Trifles make or find  Still new Avenues to the Mind  Till I with Grief and Wonder see  Huge Crouds betwixt my Lord and Me  V  Oft I am told the Muse will prove  A Friend to Piety and Love  Strait I begin some Sacred Song  And take my Saviour on my Tongue  VI  Strangely I lose his Lovely Face  To hold the Empty Sounds in Chase  At best the Chymes divide my Heart  And the Muse shares the larger part  VII  False Confident And falser Breast  Fickle and fond of every Guest  Each Airy Image as it flies  Here finds admittance thro' my Eyes  VIII  This Foolish Heart can leave her God  And Shadows tempt her Thoughts abroad  How shall I fix this Wandring Mind  Or throw my Fetters on the Wind  IX  Look gently down Almighty Grace  Prison me round in thine Embrace  Pity the Soul that would be thine  And let thy Power my Love Confine  X  Say when shall that bright Moment be  That I shall live alone for thee  My Heart no Foreign Lords adore  And the wild Muse prove false no more  Forsaken yet Hoping  I  HAPPY the Hours the Golden Days  When I could call my  Jesus  mine  And sit and view his Smiling Face  And melt in Pleasures all Divine  II  Near to my Heart within my Arms  He lay till Sin defil'd my Breast  Till broken Vows and Earthly Charms  ir'd and provok'd my Heavenly Guest  III  And now He's gone O Mighty Woe  Gone from my Soul and hides his Love  Curse on you Sins that griev'd Him so  Ye Sins that forc'd him to remove  IV  Break Break my Heart Complain my Tongue  Hither my Friends your Sorrows bring  Angels assist my Doleful

Mourner at the Funeral of the Dear Gentleman deceased I should have labour'd after more of Art in the following Composition to supply the defect of Nature and to feign  a Sorrow but the uncommon Condescension of his Friendship to Me the Inward Esteem I pay his Memory and the vast and tender Sence I have of our Loss make all the Methods of Art needless whilst natural Grief supplies more than all  I had resolv'd indeed to lament in Sighs and Silence and frequently check'd the forward Muse when she brought me Grief in Numbers and urg'd me to a tuneful Mourning but the Importunity was not to be resisted Long Lines of Sorrow flow'd in upon my Fancy 'ere I was aware whilst I took many a Solitary Walk in the Garden adjoyning to his Seat at  Newington  Nor could I free my self from the Melancholy Idea's that crowded themselves upon me and your Ladyship will find throughout the Poem that the fair and unfinish'd Building which he had just raised for himself gave almost all the turns of Mourning to my Thoughts for I pursue no other Topicks of Elegy then what my Passion and my Senses led me to  The Poem roves as my Eyes and Thoughts did from one part of the Fabrick to the other It rises from the Foundation salutes the Walls the Doors and the Windows drops a Tear upon the Roof and climbs the Turret that dear Retreat where I promis'd my self many sweet Hours of his Conversation there my Song wanders amongst the delightful Subjects Divine and Moral which used to Entertain our happy leisure and thence flings her self down to the Fields and the Shady Walks where I so often injoy'd his pleasing Discourse and my Sorrows diffuse themselves there without a limit  I had quite forgotten what I was writing till I correct my self and rise to the Turret again to lament that Desolate Seat and how vainly shines the Golden Ball that Crowns it Thus I have written without rule and with a negligence becoming Woe unfeigned  Had I design'd a compleat Elegy on your Dearest Brother and intended it for publick View I should have followed the usual Forms of Poetry spent whole Pages in the Character and Praises of the Deceased and thence took occasion to call Mankind to Complain aloud of the Universal and Unspeakable Loss But I wrote meerly for my self as a Friend of the Dead and to ease my full Soul by breathing out my own Complaint I knew his Character and Vertues so well that there was no need to mention 'em while I talk'd only with my self for the Image of them was ever present with me which kept my Sorrow lively and my Tears flowing with my Numbers  Perhaps your Ladyship will expect some Divine Thoughts and Sacred Meditations mingled with a Subject so solemn as this is Had I form'd a Design of offering it to your Hands I had compos'd a more Christian Poem But 'twas Grief purely natural for a Death so surprizing that drew all the Lines of it and therefore my highest Reflections are but of a Moral Strain Such as it is your Ladyship requires a Copy of it but let it not touch your Soul too tenderly nor renew your own Mournings Receive it  Madam  as a Sacrifice of Love and Tears offer'd at the Tomb of a Departed Friend and let it abide with you as a Witness of that  Affectionate Respect and Honour that I bore him all which as your Ladyships most rightful Due both by Merit and Succession is now humbly offered by  MADAM  Your Ladyships most Hearty and Obedient Servant  I Watts    TO THE Dear Memory of my Honoured Friend  Thomas Gunston  Esq  Who Died  November  When he had just Finish't his Seat at  NEWINGTON    OF blasted Hopes and of short withering Joys  Sing Heavenly Muse Try thine Ethereal Voice  In Funeral Numbers and a doleful Song  GUNSTON  the Just the Generous and the Young  GUNSTON  the Friend is dead O Empty Name  Of Earthly Bliss 'Tis all an Airy Dream  All a Vain Thought Our Soaring Fancies rise  On treacherous Wings and Hopes that touch the Skies  Drag but a longer Ruine thro' the downward Air  And plunge the falling Joy but deeper in Despair  How did our Souls stand flatter'd and prepar'd  To shout him welcome to the Seat he rear'd  There the Dear Man should see his Hopes Compleat  Smiling and tasting every lawful Sweet  That Peace and Plenty brings while numerous Years  Roll'd happy Circles round the Joyful Spheres  Revolving Suns should still renew his strength  And draw th' uncommon Thread to an unusual Length  But hasty Fate thrusts her dread Shears between  Cuts the Young Life off and shuts up the Scene‚ñ™  Thus Airy  Pleasure  dances in our Sight  And spreads fair Images of Gay Delight  T' allure our Souls till just within our Arms  The Vision dies and all the painted Charms  Flee quick away from the pursuing Sight  Till they are lost in Shades and mingle with the Night  Muse stretch thy Wings and thy sad Journey bend  To the fair  The House  Fabrick that thy Dying Friend  Built Nameless 'Twill suggest a thousand things  Mournful and Soft as my  Urania  Sings  How did he lay the deep  The Foundations  Foundations strong  Marking the Bounds and rear the  The Walls  Walls along  Solid and Lasting there a numerous Train  Of Happy  GUNSTON  's might in Pleasure reign  While Nations perish and long Ages run  Nations unborn and Ages unbegun  Not Time it self should waste the Blest Estate  Nor the Tenth Race rebuild the Ancient Seat  How fond our Fancies are The Founder Dies  Childless His Sisters weep and close his Eyes  And wait upon his Herse with neverceasing Cries  Lofty and Slow it moves unto the Tomb  While weighty Sorrow nods on every Plume  A Thousand Groans his dear Remains convey  To his cold Lodging in a Bed of Clay  His Countries Sacred Tears wellwatering all the Way  See the dull Wheels roll on the Sable Load  But no dear Son to tread the Mournful Road  And fondly kind drop his young Sorrows there  The Father's Urn bedewing with a Filial Tear  O had he left us One behind to play  Wanton about the Painted  The Hall  Hall and say  "  This was my Father's  with Impatient Joy  In my fond Arms I'de clasp't the Smiling Boy  And call'd him my Young Friend But Awful Fate  Design'd the mighty Stroke as lasting as 'twas great  And must this Building then this costly Frame  Stand here for Strangers Must some unknown Name  Possess these  The Rooms  Rooms the Labours of my Friend  Why were these Walls rais'd for this hapless End  Why these Apartments all adorn'd so Gay  Why his rich Fancy lavish't thus away  Muse view the  The Paintings  Paintings how the hovering Light  Plays o're the Colours in a wanton Flight  And mingled Shades wrought in by soft Degrees  Give a sweet Foyl to all the Charming Piece  But Night Eternal Night hangs black around  The dismal Chambers of the hollow Ground  And Solid Shades unmingled round his Bed  Stand Hideous Earthy Fogs embrace his Head  And noysom Vapours glide along his Face  Rising perpetual Muse forsake the place  Flee the raw Damps of the unwholsome Clay  Look to his Airy spacious Hall and say  How has he chang'd it for a loathsome Cave  Confin'd and Crowded in a narrow Grave  Th' Unhappy House looks desolate and mourns  And every  The Doors  Door groans doleful as it turns  The Pillars languish and each lofty Wall  Stately in Grief laments the Master's Fall  In drops of Briny Dew the Fabrick bears  His faint Resemblance and renews my Tears  Solid and square it rises from below  A Noble Air without a Gaudy Show  Reigns thro' the Model and adorns the Whole  Manly and Plain just like the Builders Soul  O how I love to view the Stately Frame  That dear Memorial of the bestlov'd Name  Then could I wish for some prodigious Cave  Vast as his Seat and silent as his Grave  Where the tall Shades stretch to the hideous Roof  Forbid the Day and guard the Sunbeams off  Thither my willing Feet shou'd ye be drawn  At the gray Twilight and the early Dawn  There sweetly sad shou'd my soft Minutes roll  Numbring the Sorrows of my drooping Soul  But these are Airy Thoughts Substantial Grief  Grows by those Objects that should yield Relief  Fond of my Woes I heave my Eyes around  My Grief from every Prospect courts a Wound  Views the green Gardens views the Smiling Skies  Still my Heart sinks and still my Cares arise  My wandring Feet round the dear Mansion rove  And there to sooth my Sorrows I indulge my Love  Oft have I laid the Awful  Calvin  by  And the sweet  Cowley  with Impatient Eye  To see those Walls pay the sad Visit there  And drop the Tribute of an hourly Tear  Still I behold some Melancholy Scene  With many a Pensive Thought and many a Sigh between  Two Days ago we took the Evening Air  I and my Grief and my  Urania  there  Say my  Urania  how the Western Sun  Broke from Black Clouds and in full Glory shone  Gilding the Roof then dropt into the Sea  And sudden Night devour'd the sweet remains of Day  Thus the dear Youth just rear'd his shining Head  From Obscure Shades of Life and sunk among  Dead  The rising Sun adorn'd with all his Light  Smiles on these Walls again But endless Night  Reigns uncontroul'd where the dear  GUNSTON  lies  He's set for ever and must never rise  Then why these Beams Unseasonable Star  These lightsome Smiles descending from afar  To greet a Mourning House In vain the Day  Breaks thro' the  The Windows  Windows with a joyful Ray  And marks a shining Path along the Floors  Bounding the Evening and the Morning Hours  In vain it bounds 'em While vast Emptiness  And hollow Silence reigns thro' all the Place  Nor heeds the cheerful change of Nature's Face  Yet Natures Wheels will on without controul  The Sun will rise the tuneful Spheres will roll  And the two Nightly  Bears  walk round and watch the Pole  See while I sp√®ak high on her Sable Wheel  Old Night comes rolling up the Eastern Hill  Troops of dark Clouds prepare her way behold  How their brown Pinions Edg'd with Evening Gold  Spread Shaddowing o're the House and glide away  Slowly pursuing the declining Day  O're the broad  The Roof  Roof they fly their Circuit still  Thus Days before they did and Days to come they will  But the Black Cloud that Shaddows o're his Eyes  Hangs there immoveable and never flies  Fain would I bid the Envious Gloom be gone  Ah fruitless Wish how are his Curtains drawn  For a long Evening that despairs the Dawn  Muse view the  The Turret  Turret Just beneath the Skies  Lonesome it stands and fixes both mine Eyes  As it would ask a Tear O Sacred Seat  Sacred to Friendship O Divine Retreat  Here did I hope my happy Hours t' employ  And fed beforehand on the promis'd Joy  When weary of the noisy Town my Friend  From Mortal Cares retiring shou'd ascend  And lead me thither We  Our Conversation there  alone wou'd sit  Free and secure of all Intruding Feet  Our Thoughts shou'd stretch their longest Wings and rise  Nor bound their Soarings by the lower Skies  Our Tongues shou'd aim at everlasting Themes  And speak what Mortals dare of all the Names  Of Boundless Joys and Glories Thrones and Seats  Built high in Heaven for Souls We'd trace the Streets  Of Golden Pavement walk each happy Field  And climb and tast the Fruits the spicy Mountains yield  Then would we swear to keep the Sacred Road  And walk right upwards to the blest Abode  We'd charge our parting Spirits there to meet  There Hand in Hand approach th' Almighty's Seat'  And bend our Heads adoring at our Maker's Feet  Thus should we mount on bold adventrous Wings  In high Discourse and dwell on Heavenly things  While the pleas'd Hours in sweet Succession move  And Minutes measur'd as they are above  By evercircling Joys and evershining Love  Anon our Thoughts should lower their lofty Flight  Sink by degrees and take a pleasing Sight  A large round Prospect of the spreading Plain  The Wealthy River and his Winding Train  The Smoaky City and the Busie Men  How we should smile to see degenerate Worms  Lavish their Lives and fight for Airy Forms  Of Painted Honour Dreams of empty sound  Till Envy rise and shoot a secret Wound  At swelling Glory strait the Bubble breaks  And the Scenes vanish as the Man awakes  Then the tall Titles Insolent and Proud  Sink to the Dust and mingle with the Crowd  Man is a restless Thing Still vain and wild  Lives beyond Sixty nor outgrows the Child  His hurrying Lusts still break the Sacred Bound  To seek new Pleasures on forbidden Ground  And buy them all too dear Unthinking Fool  For a short dying Joy to sell a Deathless Soul  'Tis but a Grain of Sweetness they can Sow  And reap the long sad Harvest of Immortal Woe  Another Tribe toyl in a different Strife  And banish all the lawful Sweets of Life  To sweat and dig for Gold to hoard the Oar  Hide the dear Dust yet darker than before  And never dare to use a Grain of all the Store  Happy the Man that knows the Value just  Of Earthly Things nor is enslav'd to Dust  'Tis a rich Gift the Skies but rarely send  To Fav'rite Souls Then happy thou my Friend  For thou hadst learnt to Manage and Command  The Wealth that Heaven bestow'd with Liberal Hand  Hence this fair Structure rose and hence this Seat  Made to invite my not unwilling Feet  In vain 'twas made for We shall never meet  And Smile and Love and Bless each other here  The Envious Tomb forbids thy Face t' appear  Detains thee  GVNSTON  from my longing Eyes  And all my hopes lie buried where my  GVNSTON  lies  Come hither all ye tenderest Souls that know  The heights of Fondness and the depths of Woe  Young Mothers who your darling Babes have found  Untimely Murd'red with a ghastly Wound  Ye frighted Nymphs who on the Bridal Bed  Claspt in your Arms your Lovers Cold and Dead  Come in the Pomp of all your wild Despair  With flowing Eyelids and disorder'd Hair  Death in your Looks come mingle Grief with me  And drown your little Streams in my unbounded Sea  You Sacred Mourners of a Nobler Mould  Born for a Friend whose dear Embraces hold  Beyond all Natures Ties you that have known  Two happy Souls made intimately One  And felt a parting Stroke 'tis you must tell  The Smart the Twinges and the Racks I feel  This Soul of mine that dreadsul Wound has born  Off from its Side its dearest Half is torn  The Rest lies bleeding and but lives to mourn  Oh Infinite Distress Such raging Grief  Shou'd command Pity and despair Relief  Passion methinks should rise from all my Groans  Give Sense to Rocks and Sympathy to Stones  Ye dusky  The adjacent Country  Woods and ecchoing Hills around  Repeat my Cries with a perpetual Sound  Be all ye flowry Vales with Thorns o'regrown  Assist my Sorrows and declare your own  Alas your Lord is dead The humble Plain  Must ne're receive his Courteous Feet again  Mourn ye gay smiling Meadows and be seen  In Wintry Robes instead of Youthful Green  And bid the  The Brook  Brook that still runs warbling by  Move silent on and weep his useless Channel dry  Hither methinks the lowing Herds shou'd come  And moaning Turtles murmur o're his Tomb  The Oak shou'd wither and the curling  The Trees  Vine  Weep his Young Life out while his Arms untwine  Their Amorous Folds and mix his Bleeding Soul with mine  Ye stately Elms in your long Order mourn  Strip off your Pride to dress your Master's Urn  Here gently drop your Leaves instead of Tears  Ye Elms the Reverend Growth of Ancient Years  Stand tall and naked to the Blustring Rage  Of the mad Winds thus it becomes your Age  To show your Sorrows Often ye have seen  Our Heads reclin'd upon the rising Green  Beneath your Sacred Shade diffus'd we lay  Here  Friendship  reign'd with an unbounded sway  Hither our Souls their constant Off'rings brought  The Burthens of the Breast and Labours of the Thought  Our opening Bosoms on the Conscious Ground  Spread all the Sorrows all the Joys we found  And mingled every Care nor was it known  Which of the Pains or Pleasures were our own  Then with an equal Hand and honest Soul  We share the Heap yet both possess the Whole  And all the Passions there thro' both our Bosoms roll  By turns We Comfort and by turns Complain  And Bear and Ease by turns the Sympathy of Pain  Friendship  Mysterious Thing what Magick Powers  Support thy Sway and charm these Minds of ours  Bound to thy Foot we boast our Birthright still  And dream of Freedom when we've lost our Will  And chang'd away our Souls At thy Command  We snatch new Miseries from a Foreign Hand  To call them ours and thoughtless of our Ease  Plague the dear Self that we were born to please  Thou Tyranness of Minds whose Cruel Throne  Heaps on poor Mortals Sorrows not their own  As tho' our Mother Nature cou'd no more  Find Woes sufficient for each Son she bore  Friendship divides the Shares and lengthens out the Store  Yet are we fond of thine Imperious Reign  Proud of the Slavery wanton in our Pain  And chide the courteous Hand when Death dissolves the Chain  Vertue  forgive the Thought The raving Muse  Wild and despairing knows not what she does  Grows mad in Grief and in her Savage Hours  Affronts the Name she Loves and she adores  She is thy Votaress too and at thy Shrine  O Sacred  Friendship  offer'd Songs Divine  While  GUNSTON  liv'd and both our Souls were thine  Here to these Shades at solemn Hours we came  To pay Devotion with a mutual Flame  And roll'd in Pleasures while the Evening Breeze  Fann'd the Leaves gently sporting thro' the Trees  And the declining Sun with sloping Wheels  Roll'd down the Golden Day behind the Western Hills  Mourn ye young  The Gardens  Gardens ye unfinish't Gates  Ye Green Inclosures and ye growing Sweets  Lament for ye our Midnight Hours have known  And watch'd us walking by the silent Moon  In Conference Divine while Heavenly Fire  Kindling our Breasts did all our Thoughts inspire  With Joys almost Immortal then our Zeal  Blaz'd and burnt high to reach th' Ethereal Hill  And Love refin'd like that above the Poles  Threw both our Arms round one anothers Souls  In Rapture and Embraces Oh forbear  Forbear my Song this is too much to hear  Too dreadful to repeat such Joys as these  Fled from the Earth for ever  Oh for a general Grief let all things share  Our Woes that knew our Loves The Neighbouring  The Air  Air  Let it be laden with Immortal Sighs  And tell the Gales that every Breath that flies  Over these Fields shou'd murmur and complain  And kiss the fading Grass and propagate the Pain‚ñ™  Weep all ye Buildings and ye  The Groves  Groves around  For ever Weep This is an endless Wound  Vast and Incurable Ye Buildings knew  His Silver Tongue ye Groves have heard it too  At that dear Sound no more shall ye rejoyce  And I no more must hear the Charming Voice  Wo to my drooping Soul that Heavenly Breath  That could speak Life lies now congeal'd in Death  While on his folded Lips all Cold and Pale  Eternal Chains and heavy silence dwell  Yet my fond Hope would hear him speak again  Once more at least one gentle Word and then  GUNSTON  aloud I call In vain I cry  GUNSTON  aloud for he must ne're reply  In vain I mourn and drop these Funeral Tears  Death and the Grave have neither Eyes nor Ears  Wandring I tune my Sorrows to the Groves  And vent my swelling Griefs and tell the Winds our Loves  While the dear Youth Sleeps fast and hears 'em not  He has forgot me In the lonesome Vault  Mindless of  WATTS  and Friendship there he lies  Deaf and Unthinking Clay  But whither am I led This Artless Grief  Hurries the Muse on obstinate and deaf  To all the nicer Rules and bears her down  From the tall Fabrick to the Neighbouring Ground  The pleasing Hours and the dear Moments past  In these sweet Fields reviving on my Tast  Snatch me away resistless with Impetuous hast  Spread thy strong Pinions once again my Song  And reach the  The Turret  Turret thou hast left so long  O're the wide Roof its lofty Head it rears  Waiting for our Converse but only hears  The noisie Tumults of the Realms on high  The Winds salute it Whistling as they fly  Or jarring round the Windows Rattling Showers  Lash the fair Sides above loud Thunder roars  But still the Master Sleeps nor hears the Voice  Of Sacred Friendship nor the Tempests noise  An Iron Slumber sits on every Sence  In vain the Heavenly Thunders strice to rouze it thence  One Labour more my Muse the Golden  The Golden Ball  Sphere  Seems to demand See thro' the Dusky Air  Downward it shines upon the rising Moon  And as she labours up to reach her Noon  The Ball pursues her Orb with streaming Light  And shoots a Golden D√†y on the Pale Queen of Night  But not one Beam can reach the darksome Grave  Or pierce the solid Gloom that fills the Cave  Where  GUNSTON  dwells in Death My waking Eyes  Saw the last Midnight reigning o're the Skies  And Old  Bootes  drove his shining Carr  Thro' the Midheaven Behold the Glittering Sphere  Bright as a Burning Meteor born on high  Or some new Comet gla  ing thro' the Sky  It flam'd and mingled with the larger Stars  In vain said I the Golden Comet Glares  In vain it stands while with a dismal Fall  He sunk beneath the Ground that rais'd the Lofty Ball  Now let me call the Joyful Day to mind  'Twas a fair Morning and the Blustring Wind  Slept in its peaceful Caverns while he came  Gazing and pleas'd to see the Noble Frame  Crown'd with that shining Orb "Stand there he cries  "Thou little Emblem of the boundless Skies  "Whither my Soul with fiery Passion tends  The Emblem stands and tells surviving Friends  Of the bright Palace and the Golden Throne  Where the Dear  GUNSTON  's better part is gone  His eager Thoughts bent on their shining way  Let the Clay drop to mingle with the Clay  But his great Soul beyond the Stars is fled  Then why my Heart why should we Mourn him Dead  Strangely my Thoughts ye let this cozening Grief  With a false Name impose on your Belief  It saw the Flesh sink down with closing Eyes  To the cold Earth and cry'd 'tis  GUNSTON  Dies  Mistaken Grief to call the Flesh the Friend  The Heavenly Court saw the Bright Youth ascend  Flew to embrace him with Immortal Love  And sung his Welcome to the Seats above  The Building firm and all the Mansions bright  The Roof highVaulted with Aethereal Light  Beauty and Strength on the tall Bulwarks Sate  In Heavenly Diamond And for every Gate  On Golden Hinges a broad Ruby turns  Guards off the Foe and as it moves it burns  Millions of Glories Reign thro' every part  Infinite Power and Uncreated Art  Stand here display'd and to the Stranger show  How it outshines the Noblest Seats below  The Stranger just look'd down and Smil'd upon 'em too  Come my  Urania  leave the doleful Strain  Let Heavenly Notes resume their Joys again  In Everlasting Numbers sing and say  "  GUNSTON  the Friend lives still and wipe our Tears away  AN ELEGY ON THE Reverend Mr  Tho Gouge    TO Mr  Arthur Shallett  Merchant  Worthy SIR  THE Subject of the following Elegy was high in your Esteem and enjoy'd a large share of your Affections Scarce doth his Memory need the

Pleasure to  SIR  Your obliged humble Servant  TO THE MEMORY OF THE Reverend Mr  Tho Gouge  Who Died  January  I  YE Virgin Souls whose Sweet Complaint  Could teach  Psalm Cxxxvii  Euphrates  not to flow  Could  Lam  Sion  's Ruine so Divinely Paint  Array'd in Beauty and in Woe  Awake ye Virgin Souls to mourn  And with your Tuneful Sorrows dress a Prophet's Urn  O could my Lips or Flowing Eyes  But imitate such Charming Grief  I'de teach the Seas and teach the Skies  Wailings and Sobs and Sympathies  Nor should the Stones or Rocks be deaf  Rocks shall have Eyes and Stones have Ears  While  GOUGE  's Death is Mourn'd in Melody and Tears  II  Heaven was impatient of our Crimes  And sent his Minister of Death  To Scourge the bold Rebellion of the Times  And to demand our Prophet's Breath  He came commission'd for the Fates  Of Awful  MEAD  and Charming  BATES    There he essay'd the Vengeance first  Then took a dismal Aim and brought great  GOUGE  to Dust  III  Great  GOUGE  to Dust How Doleful is the Sound  How vast the Stroke is And how wide the Wound  Yes 'tis a vast uncommon Death  Yes 'tis a Wound unmeasurably wide  No Vulgar Mortal Dy'd  When he resign'd his Breath  The Muse that Mourns a Nations Fall  Shou'd wait at  GOVGE  's Funeral  Should mingle Majesty and Groans  Such as she Sings to sinking Thrones  And in deepsounding Numbers tell  How  Sion  trembled when this Pillar fell  Sion  grows Weak and  England  Poor  Nature her self with all her Store  Can furnish such a Pomp for Death no more  IV  The Reverend Man let all things mourn  Sure he was some Aethereal Mind  Fated in Flesh to be confin'd  And order'd to be Born  His Soul was of th' Angelick frame  The same Ingredients and the Mould the same  When the Creator makes a Minister of Flame  He was all form'd of Heavenly Things  Mortals believe what my  Urania  Sings  For she has seen him rise upon his Flamy Wings  V  How would he mount how would he fly  Up thro' the Ocean of the Sky  Tow'rd the Coelestial Coast  With what amazing swiftness soar  Till Earth's dark Ball was seen no more  And all its Mountains lost  Scarce could the Muse pursue him with her Sight  But Angels you can tell  For oft you met his Wondrous Flight  And knew the Stranger well  Say how he past the radiant Spheres  And visited your happy Seats  And trac'd the well known Turnings of the Golden Streets  And walk'd among the Stars  VI  Tell how he climb'd the Everlasting Hills  Surveying all the Realms above  Born on a Strongwing'd Faith and on the Fiery Wheels  Of an Immortal Love  'Twas there he took a glorious Sight  Of the Inheritance of Saints in Light  And read their Title in their Saviour's Right  How oft the humble Scholar came  And to your Songs he rais'd his Ears  To learn the Unutterable Name  To view the Eternal Base that bears  The New Creations Frame  The Countenance of God he saw  Full of Mercy full of Awe  The Glories of his Power and Glories of his Grace  There he beheld the Wondrous Springs  Of those Eternal Sacred Things  The Peaceful Gospel and the Fiery Law  In that Majestic Face  That Face that all his Gazing Powers employ  With most profound Abasement and exalted Joy  The Rolls of Fate were half unseal'd  He stood adoring by  The Volumes open'd to his Eye  And sweet Intelligence he held  With all his shining Kindred of the Sky  VII  Ye Seraphs that surround the Throne  Tell how his Name was thro' the Pallace known  How warm his Zeal was and how like your own  Speak it aloud let half the Nation hear  And bold Blasphemers shrink and fear  Impudent Tongues to blast a Prophet's Name  The Poison sure was fetch'd from Hell  Where the old Blasphemers dwell  To taint the purest Dust and blot the whitest Fame  Impudent Tongues You should be darted thro'  Nail'd to your own Black Mouths and lie  Useless and Dead till Slander die  Till Slander die with you  VIII  "We saw him say th' Ethereal Throng  "We saw his warm Devotions rise  "We heard the fervour of his Cries  "And mixt his Praises with our Song  "We knew the secret Flights of his retiring Hours  "Nightly he wak'd his inward Powers  "Young  Israel  rose to Wrestle with his God  "And with unconquer'd Force scal'd the Coelestial Towers  "To reach the Blessing down for those that sought his Blood  "Oft we beheld the Thunderer's Hand  "Rais'd high to crush the Factious Foe  "As oft we saw the rolling Vengeance stand  "Doubtful t' obey the dread Command  "While his ascending Pray'r witheld the falling Blow  IX  Draw the past Scenes of thy Delight  My Muse and bring the Wondrous Man to Sight  Place him surrounded as he stood  With Pious Crowds while from his Tongue  A Stream of Harmony ran soft along  And every Ear drank in the flowing Good  Softly it ran its Silver Way  Till warm Devotion rais'd the Current strong  Then fervid Zeal on the sweet Deluge rode  Life Love and Glory Grace and Joy  Divinely roll'd promiscuous on the TorrentFlood  And bore our Raptur'd Sense away and Thoughts and Souls to God  O might we dwell for ever there  No more return to breath this grosser Air  This Atmosphere of Sin Calamity and Care  X  But Heavenly Scenes soon leave the Sight  While we belong to Clay  Passions of Terror and Delight  Demand alternate Sway  Behold the Man whose awful Voice  Could well proclaim the Fiery Law  Kindle the Flames that  Moses  saw  And swell the Trumpets Warlike noise  He stands the Herald of the Threatning Skies  Lo on his Reverend Brow the Frowns Divinely rise  All  Sinai  's Thunder on his Tongue and Lightning in his Eyes  Round the high Roof the Curs√®s flew  Distinguishing each guilty Head  Far from th' unequal War the Atheist fled  His Kindled Arrows still pursue  His Arrows strike the Atheist thro'  And fix him down to Dread  The Marble Heart groans with an inward Wound  Blaspheming Souls of harden'd Steel  Shriek out amaz'd at the new Pangs they feel  And dread the Eccho's of the Sound  The Lofty Wretch Arm'd and Array'd  In gaudy Pride sinks down his Impious Head  Plunges in dark Despair and mingles with the Dead  XI  Now Muse assume a softer Strain  Now sooth the Sinners Raging Smart  Borrow of  GOVGE  the wondrous Art  To calm the Surging Conscience and asswage the Pain  He from a Bleeding God derives  Life for the Souls that Guilt had slain  And strait the dying Rebel lives  The Dead arise again  The opening Skies almost obey  His powerful Song a Heavenly Ray  Awakes Despair to Light and sheds a cheerful Day  His wondrous Voice rolls back the Spheres  Recalls the Scenes of Ancient Years  To make the Saviour known  Sweetly the flying Charmer roves  Thro' all his Labours and his Loves  The Anguish of his Cross and Triumphs of his Throne  XII  Hark he invites our Feet to try  The steep ascent of  Calvary    And sets the fatal Tree before our Eye  See here Coelestial Sorrow reigns  Rude Nails and ragged Thorns lay by  Ting'd with the Crimson of Redeeming Veins  In wondrous Words he sung the Vital Flood  Where all our Sins were drown'd  Words fit to heal and fit to wound  Sharp as the Spear and Balmy as the Blood  In his Discourse Divine  Afresh the Purple Fountain flow'd  Our falling Tears kept Sympathetick Time  And trickled to the Ground  While every Accent gave a doleful Sound  Sad as the breaking Heartstrings of th' Expiring God  XIII  Down to the Mansions of the Dead  With trembling Joy our Souls are lead  The Captives of his Tongue  There the dear Prince of Light reclines his Head  Darkness and Shades among  With pleasing Horror we survey  The Caverns of the Tomb  Where the Belov'd Redeemer lay  And shed a sweet Persume  Hark the Old Earthquake roars again  In  GOUGE  's Voice and breaks the Chain  Of heavy Death and tears the Tombs  The  Rising God  he comes he comes  With Throngs of waking Saints a long triumphing Train  XIV  See the bright Squadrons of the Sky  Downward on Wings of Joy and Hast they fly  Meet their returning Sovereign and attend him high  A shining Carr the Conqueror fills  Form'd of a Golden Cloud  Slowly the Pomp rolls up the Azure Hills  Old  Satan  foams and yells aloud  And gnaws th' Eternal Brass that binds him to the Wheels  The opening Gates of Bliss receive their King  The FatherGod Smiles on his Son  Pays him the Honours he has won  The lofty Thrones adore and little Cherubs Sing  Behold him on his Native Throne  Glory sits fast upon his Head  Dress't in new Light and Beamy Robes  His Hand rolls on the Seasons and the shining Globes  And sways the living Worlds and Regions of the Dead  XV  GOUGE  was his Envoy to this Realm below  Vast was the Trust and great his Skill  Bright the Credentials he could show  And Thousands own'd the Seal  His Hallowed Lips could well impart  The Grace the Promise and Command  He knew the Pity of  EMMANUEL  's Heart  And Terrors of  JEHOVAH  's Hand  How did our Souls start out to hear  The Embassies of Love he bore  While every Ear in Rapture hung  Upon the Charming Wonders of his Tongue  Lifes busie Cares a Sacred Silence bound  Attention stood with all her Powers  With fixed Eyes and Awe profound  Chain'd to the Pleasure of the Sound  Nor knew the flying Hours  XVI  But Oh my everlasting Grief  Heaven has recall'd his Envoy from our Eyes  Hence Deluges of Sorrow rise  Nor hope th' Impossible Relief  Ye Remnants of the Sacred Tribe  Who feel the Loss come share the Smart  And mix your Groans with mine  Where is the Tongue that can describe  Infinite Things with Equal Art  Or Language so Divine  Our Passions want the Heavenly Flame  Almighty Love Breaths faintly in our Songs  And Awful Threatnings languish on our Tongues  HOWE  is a Great but single Name  Amidst the Crowd he stands alone  Stands yet but with his Starry Pinions on  Dress't for the Flight and ready to be gone  Eternal God command his Stay  Stretch the dear Months of his Delay  O we could wish his Age were one Immortal Day  But when the Flaming Chariot's come  And shining Guards t' attend thy Prophet Home  Amidst a thousand Weeping Eyes  Send an  Elisha  down a Soul of Equal Size  Or burn the Worthless Globe and take us to the Skies  AN EPITAPH ON King  WILLIAM  III Of Glorious Memory Who
