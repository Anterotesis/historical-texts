did not much fear being able to raise the money but money is of little use unless some persons of sense and piety can be found to direct these institutions Not that I would discourage those who set them up even in the most ordinary manner or from mere views of worldly policy It is something gained to rescue children from idling away their Sabbath in the fields or the streets It is no small thing to keep them from those tricks to which a day of leisure tempts the idle and the ignorant It is something for them to be taught to read it is much to be taught to read the Bible and much indeed to be carried regularly to church But all this is not enough To bring these institutions to answer their highest end can only be effected by God's blessing on the following means the choice of able teachers and a diligent attention in some pious gentry to visit and inspect the schools  On RECOMMENDATIONS  Mrs Jones had one talent that eminently qualified her to do good namely judgment this even in the gay part of her life had kept her from many mistakes but though she had sometimes been deceived herself she was very careful not to deceive others in recommending people to fill any office either through selfishness or false kindness She used to say "there is always some one appropriate quality which every person must possess in order  to fit them for any particular employment Even in this quality" said she to Mr Simpson the Clergyman "I do not expect perfection but if they are destitute of this whatever good qualities they may possess besides though they may do for some other employment they will not do for this If I want a pair of shoes I go to a shoemaker I do not go to a man of another trade however ingenious he may be to ask him if he cannot  contrive  to make me a pair of shoes When I lived in London I learnt to be much on my guard as to recommendations I found people often wanted to impose on me some one who was a burthen to themselves Once I remember when I undertook to get a matron for an hospital half my acquaintance had some one to offer me Mrs Gibson sent me an old cook whom she herself had discharged for wasting her own provisions yet she had the conscience to recommend this woman to take care of the provisions of a large community Mrs Grey sent me a discarded housekeeper whose constitution had been ruined by sitting up with Mrs Grey's gouty husband but who she yet thought might do well enough to undergo the fatigue of taking care of an hundred poor sick people A third friend sent me a woman who had no merit but that of being very poor and it would be charity to provide for her The truth is the lady was obliged to allow her a small pension till she could get her off her own hands by turning her on those of others"  "It is very true Madam" said Mr Simpson "the right way is always to prefer the good of the many to the good of one if indeed it can be called doing good to any one to place them in a station in which they must feel unhappy by not knowing  how to discharge the duties of it I will tell you how I manage If the persons recommended are objects of charity I privately subscribe to their wants I pity and help them but I never promote them to a station for which they are unfit and thus hurt a whole community to help a distressed individual"  Thus Mrs Jones resolved that the first step towards setting up her school should be to provide a suitable mistress The vestry were so earnest in recommending one woman that she thought it worth looking into On enquiry she found it was a scheme to take a large family off the parish they never considered that a very ignorant woman with a family of young children was not fit for a school all they considered was that the profits of the school might enable her to live without parish pay Mrs Jones refused another though she could read well and was decent in her conduct because she used to send her children to the shop on Sundays And she objected to a third a very sensible woman because she was suspected of making an outward profession of religion a cloak for immoral conduct Mrs Jones knew she must not be too nice neither she knew she must put up with many faults at last "I know" said she to Mr Simpson "the imperfection of every thing that is human As the mistress will have much to bear with from the children so I expect to have something to bear with in the mistress and she and I must submit to our respective trials by thinking how much God has to bear with in us all But there are three things which a mistress must not be without  good sense activity  and  piety  Without the first she will mislead others without the second she will neglect  them and without the third though she may civilize yet she will never christianize them"  Mr Simpson said "he really knew but of one person in the parish who was fully likely to answer her purpose this" continued he "is no other than my house keeper Mrs Betty Crew It will indeed be a great loss to me to part from her and to her it will be a far more fatiguing life than she at present leads But ought I to put my own personal comfort or ought Betty to put her own ease and quiet in competition with the good of above an hundred children This will appear still more important if we consider the good done not as  fruit  but  seed  if we take into the account how many yet unborn may become christians in consequence of our making these children christians For how can we calculate the number which may be hereafter trained for heaven by those very children we are going to teach when they themselves shall become parents and you and I are dead and forgotten To be sure by parting from Betty my peasesoup will not be quite so well flavoured nor my linen so neatly got up but the day is fast approaching when all this will signify but little but it will not signify a little whether one hundred immortal souls were the better from my making this petty sacrifice Betty Crew is a real christian has excellent sense and had a good education from my mother She has also had a little sort of training for when the poor children come to the parsonage for the broth on a Saturday evening Betty is used to appoint them all to come at the same time and after she has filled their pitchers she ranges them round her in the garden and examines them in their catechism She is just and fair  in dealing out the broth and beef not making my favour to the parents depend on the skill of their children But her own old caps and ribbons and cast off cloaths are bestowed as little rewards on the best scholars So that taking the time she spends in working for them and the things she gives them there is many a lady who does not exceed Betty in acts of charity this I mention to confirm your notion that it is not necessary to be rich in order to do good a religious upper servant has great opportunities of this sort"  My readers I trust need not be informed that this is that very Mrs Betty Crew who assisted Mrs Jones in teaching poor women to cut out linen and cook cheap dishes as related in the Cottage Cook Mrs Jones in the following week got together as many of the mothers as she could and spoke to them as follows  Mrs  JONES's EXHORTATION  "My good women on Sunday next I propose to open a school for the instruction of your children Those among you who know what it is to be able to read your Bible will I doubt not rejoice that the same blessing is held out to your children You who are  not  able yourselves to read what your Saviour has done and suffered for you ought to be doubly anxious that your children should reap a blessing which you have lost Would not that mother be thought an unnatural monster who should stand by and snatch out of her child's mouth the bread which a kind friend had just put into it But such a mother would be merciful compared with her who should rob her children of the opportunity of learning to read the word of God when it is held out to them Remember that if  you slight the present offer or if after having sent your children a few times you should afterwards keep them at home under vain pretences you will have to answer for it at the day of judgment Let not your poor children  then  have cause to say "my fond mother was my worst enemy I might have been bred up in the fear of the Lord and she opposed it for the sake of a little paltry pleasure for an idle holiday I am now brought to the gates of hell" My dear women which of you could bear to see your darling child condemned to everlasting destruction which of you could bear to hear him accuse you as the cause of it Is there any mother here present who will venture to say 'I will doom the child I bore to sin and hell rather than put them or myself to a little present pain by curtailing their evil inclinations I will let them spend the Sabbath in ignorance and idleness instead of sending them to school' Let that mother who values her child's pleasure more than his soul now walk away and I will set down the names of all those who wish to bring their young ones up in the way that leads to eternal life instead of indulging them in the pleasures of sin which are but for a moment"  When Mrs Jones had done speaking most of the women thanked her for her good advice and hoped that God would give them grace to follow it promising to send their children constantly Others who were not so well disposed were yet afraid to refuse after the sin of so doing had been so plainly set before them The worst of the women had kept away from this meeting resolving to set their faces against the school Most of them who were present as soon as they got home set  about providing their children with what little decent apparel they could raise Many a willing mother lent her tall daughter her hat best cap and white handkerchief and many a grateful father spared his linen waistcoat and bettermost hat to induce his grown up son to attend for it was a rule with which Mrs Jones began that she would not receive the younger children out of any family who did not send their elder ones Too many made excuses that their shoes were old or their hat worn out But Mrs Jones told them not to bring any excuses to her which they could not bring to the day of judgment and among those excuses she would hardly admit any except accidents sickness or attendance on sick parents or young children  SUBSCRIPTIONS  Mrs Jones was very desirous of getting the help and countenance of the farmers and tradespeople whose duty she thought it was to support a plan calculated to improve the virtue and happiness of the parish Most of them subscribed and promised to see that their workmen sent their children She met with little opposition till she called on farmer Hoskins She told him as he was the richest farmer in the parish she came to him for a handsome subscription "Subscription" said he "it is nothing but subscriptions I think a man had need be made of money" "Farmer" said Mrs Jones "God has blessed you with abundant prosperity and he expects you should be liberal in proportion to your great ability" "I do not know what you mean by blessing" said he "I have been up early and late lived hard while I had little and now when I thought I had got forward  in the world what with tythes and subscriptions it all goes I think" "Mr Hoskins" said Mrs Jones "this is but an ungrateful return for all your blessings" "You are again at your blessings" said the Farmer "but let every one work as hard as I have done and I dare say he will do as well It is to my own industry I owe what I have My crops have been good because I minded my ploughing and sowing" "O farmer" cried Mrs Jones "you forget whose suns and showers make your crops to grow but I do not come here to preach but to beg" "Well madam what is it now Flannel or French or weavers or a new church or large bread or cheap rice or what other new whimwham for getting the money out of ones pocket" "I am going to establish a Sunday school farmer and I come to you as one of the principal inhabitants hoping your example will spur on the rest to give" "Why then" said the farmer "as one of the principal inhabitants I will give nothing hoping it will spur on the rest to refuse Of all the foolish inventions and newfangled devices to ruin the country that of teaching the poor to read is the very worst" "And I farmer think that to teach good principles to the lower classes is the most likely way to save the country Now in order to this we must teach them to read" "Not with my consent nor my money" said the farmer "for I know it always does more harm than good" "So it may" said Mrs Jones "if you only teach them to read and then turn them adrist to find out books for themselves There is a proneness in the heart to evil which it is our duty to counteract and which I see you are promoting Only look round your own kitchen I am ashamed to see it hung round  with loose songs and ballads I grant indeed it would be better for your men and maids and even your daughters not to be able to read at all then to read such stuff as this But if when they ask for bread you will give them a stone nay worse a serpent your's is the blame" Then taking up a penny book which had a very loose title she went on "I do not wonder if you who read such books as these think it safer that people should not read at all" The farmer grinned and said it is hard if a man of my substance may not divert myself when a bit of fun costs only a penny and a man can spare that penny there is no harm done When it is very hot or very wet and I come in to rest and have drank my mug of cider I like to take up a bit of a jest book or a comical story to make me laugh "O Mr Hoskins" replied Mrs Jones "when you come in to rest from a burning sun or shower do you never think of him whose sun it is that is ripening your corn or whose shower is filling the ear or causing the grass to grow I could tell you of some books which would strengthen such thoughts whereas such as you read only serve to put them out of your head" Mrs Jones having taken pains to let Mr Hoskins know that all the genteel and wealthy people had subscribed he at last said "Why as to the matter of that I do not value a crown only I think it might be better bestowed and I am afraid my own workmen will fly in my face if once they are made scholars and that they will think themselves too good to work" "Now you talk soberly and give your reasons" said Mrs Jones "weak as they are they deserve an answer Do you think that either man woman or child ever did his duty the worse only because  he knew it the better" "No perhaps not" "Now the whole extent of learning which we intend to give the poor is only to enable them to read the Bible a book in which every duty is explained every doctrine brought into practice and the brightest truths made level to the meanest understanding The knowledge of that book and its practical influence on the heart is the best security you can have both for the industry and obedience of your servants Now can you think any man will be the worse servant for being a good christian" "Perhaps not" "are not the duties of children of servants and the poor expressly set forth in the Bible" "Yes" "Do you think any duties are likely to be so well performed from any human motives such as fear or prudence as from these religious motives which are backed with the sanctions of rewards and punishments of heaven or hell Even upon your own principles of worldly policy do you think a poor man is not less likely to steal a sheep or a horse who was taught when a boy that it was a sin to rob a henroost or an orchard Will your property be secured so effectually by the stocks on the green as by teaching the boys in the school that  for all these things God will bring them into judgment  Is a poor fellow who can read his Bible so likely to sleep or to drink away his few hours of leisure as one who  cannot  read He may and he often does make a bad use of his reading but I doubt he would have been as bad without it And the hours spent in learning to read will always have been among the most harmless ones of his life"  "Well madam" said the farmer "if you do not think that religion will spoil my young servants  I do not care if you do put me down for half a guinea What has farmer Dobson given" "Half a guinea" said Mrs Jones "Well" cried the farmer "it shall never be said I did not give more than he who is only a renter Dobson give half a guinea Why he wears his coat as thread bare as a labourer "Perhaps" replied Mrs Jones "that is one reason why he gives so much" Well put me down a guinea" cried the farmer "As scarce as guineas are just now I'll never be put upon the same footing with Dobson neither" "Yes and you must exert yourself besides in insisting that your workmen send their children and often look into the school yourself to see if they are there and reward or discourage them accordingly" added Mrs Jones as she took her leave The farmer insisted in waiting on her to the door When they got into the yard they spied Mr Simpson who was standing near a little group of females consisting of the farmer's two young daughters and a couple of rosy dairy maids an old blind fiddler and a woman who led him The woman had laid a basket on the ground out of which she was dealing some songs to the girls who were kneeling round it and eagerly picking out such whose titles suited their tastes On seeing the clergyman come up the fiddler's companion for I am sorry to say she was not his wife pushed some of the songs to the bottom of the basket turned round to the company and in a whining tone asked "if they would please to buy a godly book" Mr Simpson saw through the hypocrisy at once and instead of making any answer took out of one of the girl's hands a song which the woman had not been able to snatch away He was shocked and grieved to see that  these young girls were about to read to sing and to learn by heart such ribaldry as he was ashamed even to cast his eyes on He turned about to the girl and gravely but mildly said "young woman what do you think should be done to a person who should be found carrying a box of poison round the country and leaving a little at every house" The girls all agreed that such a person ought to be hanged" "that he should" said the farmer "if I was upon the jury" The fiddler and his woman were of the same opinion declaring  they  would not do such a wicked thing for the world for if they were poor they were honest Mr Simpson turning to the other girl said "which is of most value the soul or the body" "The soul sir" said the girl "Why so" said he "because sir I have heard you say in the pulpit the soul is to last for ever" Then cried Mr Simpson in a stern voice turning to the fiddler's woman "are not you ashamed to sell poison for that part which is to last for ever poison for the soul" "Poison" said the terrified girl throwing down the book and shuddering as people do who are afraid they have touched something infectious "Poison" echoed the farmer's daughters recollecting with horror the ratsbane which Lion the old house dog had got at the day before and after eating which she had seen him drop down dead in convulsions "Yes" said Mr Simpson to the woman "I do again repeat the souls of these innocent girls will be poisoned and may be eternally ruined by this vile trash which you carry about"  "I now see" said Mrs Jones to the farmer "the reason why you think learning to read does more harm than good It is indeed far better that  they should never know how to tell a letter unless you keep such trash as this out of their way and provide them with what is good or what is harmless Still this is not the fault of reading but the abuse of it Wine is still a good cordial though it is too often abused to the purpose of drunkenness  The farmer said that neither of his maids could read their horn book though he owned he often heard them singing that song which the parson had thought so bad but for his part it made him as merry as a nightingale  "Yes" said Mrs Jones "as a proof that it is not merely being able to read which does the mischief I have often heard as I have been crossing a hayfield young girls singing such indecent ribaldry as has driven me out of the field though I well knew they could not read a line of what they were singing but had caught it from others So you see you may as well say the memory is a wicked talent because some people misapply it as to say that reading is dangerous because some folks abuse it"  While they were talking the fiddler and his woman were trying to steal away but Mr Simpson stopped them and said "woman I shall have some farther talk with you I am a magistrate as well as a minister and if I know it I will no more allow a wicked book to be sold in my parish than a dose of poison" The girls threw away all their songs thanked Mr Wilson begged Mrs Jones would take them into her school after they had done milking in the evenings that they might learn to read only what was proper They promised they would never more deal with any but sober honest hawkers such as sell good little books Christmas carrols and harmless songs and desired the fiddler's woman never to call there again  This little incident afterwards confirmed Mrs Jones in a plan she had before some thoughts of putting in practice This was after her school had been established a few months to invite all the welldisposed grownup youth of the parish to meet her at the school an hour or two on a Sunday evening after the necessary business of the dairy and of serving the cattle was over Both Mrs Jones and her agent had the talent of making this time pass so agreeably by their manner of explaining scripture and of impressing the heart by serious and affectionate discourse that in a short time the evening school was nearly filled with a second company after the younger ones were dismissed In time not only the servants but the sons and daughters of the most substantial people in the parish attended At length many of the parents pleased with the improvement so visible in the young people got a habit of dropping in that they might learn how to instruct their own families And it was observed that as the school filled not only the fivescourt and publichouse were thinned but even Sunday gossiping and teavisiting declined Even Farmer Hoskins who was at first angry with his maids for learning of those  merry  songs as he called them was so pleased by the manner in which the psalms were sung at the school that he promised Mrs Jones to make her a present of half a sheep towards her first Mayday feast Of this feast some account shall be given hereafter and the reader may expect some further account of the Sunday School next month in the History of Hester Wilmot  Z  END OF THE FIRST PART
