 MUSAEUS  A MONODY TO THE MEMORY of Mr  POPE  IN Imitation of MILTON's  Lycidas    T Hayman inv et del  C Grignion Sculp  LONDON  Printed for R DODSLEY at  Tully  's Head in  Pallmall  and sold by M COOPER at the  Globe  in  PaternosterRow    MUSAEUS  A MONODY  SOrrowing I catch the reed and call the muse  If yet a muse on Britain's plain abide  Since rapt MUSAEUS tun'd his parting strain  With him they liv'd with him perchance they dy'd  For who e'er since their virgin train espy'd  Or on the banks of Thames or that mild plain  Where Isis sparkles to the sunny ray  Or have they deign'd to play  Where Camus winds along his broider'd vale  Feeding each white pink and each daisie pied  That mingling paint his rushyfringed side  Yet ah coelestial maids ye are not dead  Immortal as ye are ye may not die  And well I ween ye cannot quite be fled  E'er ye entune his mournful elegy  Stay then awhile O stay ye fleeting fair  Revisit yet nor hallow'd Hippocrene  Nor Thespia's shade till your harmonious teen  Be grateful pour'd in some slowdittied air  Such tribute paid again ye may repair  To what lov'd haunt you whilom did elect  Whether Lycaeus or that mountain fair  Trim Maenalus with piny verdure deckt  But now it boots you not in these to stray  Or yet Cyllene's hoary shade to chuse  Or where mild Ladon's welling waters play  Forego each vain excuse  And haste to Thames's shores for Thames shall join  Our sad society and passing mourn  Letting cold tears bedew his silver urn  And when the poet's widow'd grot he laves  His reedcrown'd locks shall shake his head shall bow  His tide no more in eddies blith shall rove  But creep soft by with longdrawn murmurs slow  For oft the poet rous'd his charmed waves  With martial notes or lull'd with strain of love  He must not now in brisk maeanders flow  Gamesome and kiss the sadlysilent shore  Without the loan of some poetic woe  Can I forget how erst his osiers made  Sad sullen music as bleak Eurus fann'd  Can I forget how gloom'd yon laureat shade  E'er death remorseless wav'd his ebon wand  How midst yon grot each silver trickling spring  Wander'd the shelly channels all among  While as the coral roof did softly ring  Responsive to their sweetlydoleful song  Meanwhile all pale th' expiring poet laid  And sunk his awful head  While vocal shadows pleasing dreams prolong  For so his sick'ning spirits to release  They pour'd the balm of visionary peace  First sent from Cam's fair banks like Palmer old  Came  Came Tityrus  c  i e  CHAUCER a name frequently given him by Spenser vide  Shep Cal  Ecl and Elsewhere  TITYRUS slow with head all silver'd o'er  And in his hand an oaken crook he bore  And thus in antique guise short talk did hold  "Grete clerk of Fame' is house whose excellence  "Ma  e wele befitt thilk place of eminence  "Mickle of wele betide thy houres last  "For mich gode wirkè to me don and past  For syn the daies whereas my lyre ben strongen  And deftly many a mery laie I songen  "Old Time which alle things don maliciously  "Gnawen with rusty tooth continually  "Gnattrid my lines that they all cancrid ben  "Till at the last thou smoothen 'hem hast again  "Sithence full semely gliden my rymes rude  "As if fitteth thilk similitude  "Whannè shallow brooke yrenneth hobling on  "Ovir rough stones it maken full rough song  "But them stones removen this lite rivere  "Stealen forth by making plesaunt murmere  "So my sely rymes whoso may them note  "Thou maken everichone to ren right sote  "And in thy verse entuneth so fetisely  "That men sayen I make trewe melody  "And speaken every dele to myne honoure  "Mich wele grete clerk betide thy parting houre"  He ceas'd his homely rhyme  When  Colin Clout    i e  SPENSER which name he gives himself throughout his works  COLIN CLOUT Eliza's shepherd swain  The blithest lad that ever pip'd on plain  Came with his reed softwarbling on the way  And thrice he bow'd his head with motion mild  And thus his gliding numbers gan essay  I  The two first stanzas of this speech as they relate to Pastoral are written in the measure which Spenser uses in the first eclogue of the  Shepherd's Calendar  the rest where he speaks of Fable are in the stanza of the  Faery Queen    "Ah luckless swain alas how art thou lorn  "Who once like me could'st frame thy pipe to play  "Shepherds devise and chear the ling'ring morn  "Ne bush ne breere but learnt thy roundelay  "Ah plight too sore such worth to equal right  "Ah worth too high to meet such piteous plight  II  "But I nought strive poor Colin to compare  "My Hobbin's or my Thenot's rustic skill  "To thy deft swains whose dapper dities rare  "Surpass ought else of quaintest shepherd's quill  "Ev'n Roman Tityrus that peerless wight  "Mote yield to thee for dainties of delight  III  "Eke when in Fable's flow'ry paths you stray'd  "Masking in cunning feints truth's splendent face  "Ne Sylph ne Sylphid but due tendence paid  "To sheild Belinda's lock from felon base  "But all mote nought avail such harm to chace  "Then Una fair 'gan droop her princely mien  "Eke Florimel and all my faery race  "Belinda far surpast my beauties sheen  "Belinda subject meet for such soft lay I ween  IV  "Like as in villag'd troop of birdlings trim  "Where Chanticleer his red crest high doth hold  "And quaking Ducks that wont in lake to swim  "And Turkeys proud and Pigeons nothing bold  "If chance the Peacock doth his plumes unfold  "Eftsoons their meaner beauties all decaying  "He glist'neth purple and he glist'neth gold  "Now with bright green now blue himself arraying  "Such is thy beauty bright all other beauties swaying  V  "But why do I descant this toyish rhyme  "And fancies light in simple guise pourtray  "Listing to chear thee at this ruefull time  "While as black Death doth on thy heartstrings prey  "Yet rede aright and if this friendly lay  "Thou nathless judgest all too slight and vain  "Let my wellmeaning mend my ill essay  "So may I greet thee with a nobler strain  "When soon we meet for aye in yon starsprinkled plain"  Last came a bard of more exalted tread  And  Hight Thyrsis    i e  MILTON  Lycidas  and the  Epitaphium Damonis  are the only Pastorals we have of Milton's in the latter of which where he laments  Car Deodatus  under the name of  Damon  he calls himself  Thyrsis    THYRSIS hight by Dryad Fawn or Swain  Whene'er he mingled with the sylvan train  But seldom that for higher thoughts he fed  For him full oft the heav'nly Muses led  To clear Euphrates and the secret mount  To Araby and Eden fragrant climes  All which the sacred bard would oft recount  And thus in strain unus'd in grove or shade  To sad MUSAEUS rightful homage paid  "Thrice hail thou heav'ntaught Warbler last and best  "Of all the train Poet in whom conjoin'd  "All that to ear or heart or head could yield  "Rapture harmonious manly clear sublime  "Accept this gratulation may it chear  "Thy sinking soul nor these corporeal ills  "Ought daunt thee or appall Know in high heav'n  "Fame blooms eternal o'er that spirit divine  "Who builds immortal verse There thy bold Muse  "Which while on earth could breath Maeonian fire  "Shall soar seraphic heights while to her voice  "Ten thousand Hierarchies of Angels harp  "Symphonious and with dulcet harmonies  "Usher the song rejoicing I meanwhile  "To sooth thee in these irksome hours of pain  "Approach thy visitant with mortal laud  "To praise thee mortal First as first beseems  "For rhyme subdued Rhyme erst the minstrel rude  "Of Chaos Anarch old she near his throne  "Oft taught the ratling elements to chime  "With tenfold din till late to earth upborn  "On strident wing what time fair Poesie  "Emerg'd from Gothic cloud and faintly shot  "Rekindling gleams of lustre Her the fiend  "Opprest forcing to utter uncouth dirge  "Runic or Leonine and with dire chains  "Fetter'd her scarcefledg'd pinion I such bonds  "Aim'd to destroy mistaking bonds like these  "'Twere greater art t'ennoble and refine  "For this superiour part MUSAEUS came  "Thou cam'st and at thy magic touch the chains  "Off dropt and passing strange softwreathed bands  "Of flow'rs their place supply'd which well the Muse  "Might wear for choice not force obstruction none  "But lov'liest ornament Wond'rous this yet here  "The wonder rests not various argument  "Remains for me all doubting where to cull  "The primal grace where countless graces charm  "Various this peaceful scene this mineral roof  "This 'semblage meet of coral ore and shell  "These pointed crystals fair mid each obscure  "Bright glist'ring all these slowlydripping rills  "That tinkling stray amid the cooly cave  "Yet not this various peaceful scene with this  "Its mineral roof nor this assemblage meet  "Of coral ore and shell nor mid th' obscure  "These pointed crystals glist'ring fair nor rills  "That straying tinkle thro' the cooly cave  "Deal charms more various to each raptur'd sense  "Than thy mellifluous lay"  "Cease friendly swain  MUSAEUS cry'd and rais'd his aching head  "All praise is foreign but of true desert  "Plays round the head but comes not to the heart  "Ah why recall the toys of thoughtless youth  When flow'ry fiction held the place of truth  "When fancy rul'd when trill'd each trivial strain  "But idly sweet and elegantly vain  "O in that strain if all of wit had flow'd  "All music warbled and all beauty glow'd  "Had liveliest nature happiest art combin'd  "That lent each grace and This each grace refin'd  "Alas how little were my proudest boast  "The sweetest trifler of my tribe at most  "To sway the judgment while he charms the ear  "To curb mad passion in its wild career  "To blend with skill as loftiest themes inspire  "All reason's rigour and all fancy's fire  "Be this the poet's praise With this uncrown'd  "Wit dies a jest and poetry a sound  "Come then that honest fame whose sober ray  "Or gilds the satire or the moral lay  "Which dawns tho' thou rough DONNE hew out the line  "But beams sage HORACE from each strain of thine  "O if like these one poet more could brave  "The venal statesman or the titled slave  "Brand frontless Vice strip all her stars and strings  "Nor spare her basking in the smile of Kings  "Yet stoop to Virtue tho' the prostrate maid  "Lay sadly pale in bleak misfortune's shade  If grave yet lively rational yet warm  "Clear to convince and eloquent to charm  "He pour'd for her lov'd cause serene along  "The purest precept in the sweetest song  "For her lov'd cause he trac'd his moral plan  "Yon various region of bewild'ring man  "Explor'd alike each scene that frown'd or smil'd  "The flow'ry garden or the weedy wild  "Unmov'd by sophistry unaw'd by name  "No dupe to doctrines and no fool to fame  "Led by no system's devious glare astray  "As earthborn meteors glitter to betray  "But all his soul to reason's rule resign'd  "And heav'n's own views fairop'ning on his mind  "Catch'd from bright nature's flame the living ray  "Thro' passion's cloud pour'd in resistless day  "And this great truth in all its lustre shew'd  "That GOD IS WISE and ALL CREATION GOOD  If this his boast pour here the welcome lays  "Praise less than this is impotence of praise"  "To pour that praise be mine" fair VIRTUE cry'd  And shot all radiant thro' an op'ning cloud  But ah my Muse how will thy voice express  Th' immortal strain harmonious as it flow'd  Ill suits immortal strain a doric dress  And far too high already hast thou soar'd  Enough for thee that when the lay was o'er  The goddess clasp'd him to her throbbing breast  But what might that avail Blind Fate before  Had op'd her shears to slit his vital thread  And who may hope gainsay her stern behest  Then thrice he wav'd the hand thrice bow'd the head  And sigh'd his soul to rest  Then wept the Nymphs witness ye waving shades  Witness ye winding streams the Nymphs did weep  The heav'nly Goddess too with tears did steep  Her plaintive voice that echo'd thro' the glades  And "cruel gods" and "cruel stars" she cry'd  Nor did the shepherds thro' the woodlands wide  On that sad day or to the pensive brook  Or stagnant river drive their thirsty flocks  Nor did the wildgoat brooze the steepy rocks  And Philomel her custom'd oak forsook  And roses wan were wav'd by zephyrs weak  As Nature's self was sick  And ev'ry lilly droop'd its velvet head  And groan'd each faded lawn and leafless grove  Sad sympathy yet sure his rightful meed  Who charm'd all nature well might Nature mourn  Thro' all her sweets and flow'r and lawn and shade  All vocal grown all weep MUSAEUS dead  Here end we Goddess this your shepherd sang  All as his hands an ivy chaplet wove  O make it worthy of the sacred bard  And make it equal to the shepherd's love  Nor thou MUSAEUS from thine ear discard  For well I ween thou hear'st my doleful song  Whether 'mid angel troops the stars among  From golden harp thou call'st seraphic lays  Or anxious for thy dearest Virtue's fare  Thou still art hov'ring o'er our tuneless sphere  And mov'st some hidden spring her weal to raise  Thus the fond swain on doric oate essay'd  Manhood's prime honours downing on his cheek  Trembling he strove to court the tuneful maid  With stripling arts and dalliance all too weak  Unseen unheard beneath an hawthorn shade  But now dun clouds the welkin 'gan to streak  And now downdropt the larks and ceas'd their strain  They ceas'd and with them ceas'd the shepherd swain  FINIS
