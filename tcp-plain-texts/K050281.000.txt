 THE DANGER OF Court Differences OR THE Unhappy EFFECTS OF A  Motley Ministry  Occasion'd by the Report of Changes at COURT  LONDON  Printed and Sold by  J Baker  and  T Warner  at the  BlackBoy  in  PaternosterRow  Price  d  THE DANGER OF Court Differences  c  _STATE Polity  is the  Devil  's Divinity said good old Bishop  Latimer  the Martyr when some of the Moderators in Reformation were for Temporising between  Popery  and the  Protestant Religion  and for not making a thorough Turn for fear of the high Popish Party among the People  The Case was this and the History of it may be for our Edification  The King being settled in the Throne and having declar'd Himself a  Protestant  and that as He was the first  Protestant  King that ever wore the Crown so He resolv'd to make the first avow'd effectual Step to a Reformation The good Bishops the godly and zealous Ministers and the religious People of all Kinds who had been Sufferers in the late Reign and under the Tyranny of his Father these I say began to lift up their Heads own'd the King warmly and encourag'd Him exceedingly in the blessed Work of Pulling up Popery and Tyranny by the Roots and Planting the  Protestant  Religion and Liberty in the Room of it  BY THE WAY you are desired to NOTE  that Popery and Tyranny went then always together  tho' Tyranny has got another Companion since call'd  High Church  with the Reformation came in  English  Liberty  that is to say the Perfection of it and as that Reformation went on farther and farther Liberty grew in its Stature and Strength till it arriv'd to where it is now But of this on another Occasion I may say more  When the Reformation I say was thus attempted the  Popish  Clergy the  High Church of that Day  raised a hideous OutCry that  the Church was in Danger  and not only so but possess'd the ignorant People all over the Kingdom with such blind Zeal and ridiculous Notions as well of the King as of the Reformation that it first spread in a general Disaffection and afterwards broke out into a most dangerous Rebellion in several Parts of the Kingdom particularly in the West where the City of  Exeter  was closely besieged by Rebels and at  Norwich  where  KET  a Tanner at the Head of Men took the City twice and did a great deal of Mischief  When these Rebellions were by the Zeal and Loyalty of the Protestant    Whig  Party and by the Assistance of some Foreign Troops  Germans  reduced and the Rebels had received the Reward of their Treason some in the Field and some afterwards at the Gallows it was not doubted but then the King being established and his Enemies subdued the Work of Reformation might go on without interruption and that its Enemies would receive all possible Discouragement at Court the rather because it was known that the true Settlement of God's Church and of the true Religion was the King's fix'd Design That as He had Zeal sufficient to suffer any thing rather than to give over his just Undertaking so He had Courage even beyond himself both to stand by his Friends and to do Justice to his Enemies and to fear no Man  But in the middle of this happy Scituation of Things a cursed Spirit of Trimming call'd at that Time  State Policy  thrust it self in among the great Men at Court and had not the Courage Steddiness and Resolution  of the King tho' not at that Time fully acquainted with the  English  Government interposed the Reformation had been ruin'd and crush'd in its Birth all the Blood and Treasure spent all the long struggle of the  Protestant  Party in the preceeding Reign and all the Expectations the World had entertained of a happy Establishment in this Nation had been lost and destroyed indeed notwithstanding all the King could do and even in spight of his Resolution to the contrary it did make great Impressions upon his Affairs and great Havock among his Friends brought his Friends to fall out and quarrel with one another and obliged the mildest and most merciful King on Earth to sign the Execution of his nearest Friends and now as one  Party  then another got uppermost in the Administration the poor afflicted  Prince  was oblig'd to act now this Way then that Way contrary even to his own Inclination and sometimes almost contrary to his Principle  We who are the Posterity of those  Reformers  and who now enjoy our Liberty and Religion as the Consequence of that excellent Prince's Zeal and Sincerity in  Religion  have reason to be thankful that He stood his Ground in religious Matters and had He with the same steddiness and Courage governed his turbulent mercenary and everclashing disagreeing Courtiers we had perhaps enjoy'd many Ages ago an Inheritance of Liberties which the World are not yet acquainted with for 'tis evident that the Pride the Ambition the Avarice and Envy which reign'd among the Ministers of that Reign so effectually disconcerted their Measures and divided their Interests that they could not support the Settlement of the Succession beyond the Life of that King but fell first off from one another and then fell all in with  Mary  the Daughter of King  Henry  who was declared Illegitimate was set aside by the Establishment and was no better at that Time than a Popish Pretender and had not a more  Masculine Spirit govern'd them in the next Reign after tho' in the Person of a Woman we had as the Effect of those Court Divisions been all at this time Papists and Slaves Idolaters in our religious Conduct and mean dejected Scoundrels in our civil Conduct and such would our Posterity have been also  The Secret History of this Devilish Court Snare I mean as to the religious Part and as well what Danger it put the Reformation in as also how it was quash'd with one noble steddy Word of that resolute and pious Prince must needs be very diverting and profitable to all that read it especially at a time when the Enemies of the same Reformation are trying the same Hellish Practices upon the very same Nation  The Sum of the Story is this The King being young in the Government at his first Accession to the Crown was however very happily surrounded with grave and wise Counsellers in whose Wisdom and Fidelity  Vigilance and Courage the Nation had a full satisfaction They fought his Battles abroad with Gallantry and with Success they governed his Affairs at Home with extraordinary Sagacity Judgment Prudence and Justice The very Name of the King began to be terrible to Popery The Mobbs and Tumults abated as well as the Rebellious were quash'd and which was still better than all the general Disaffection of the People began to wear off and the publick Affairs seemed to run with a full Channel into Peace and Settlement when two unhappy things which on a sudden broke out among the Courtiers and Ministers of State had like to have overthrown Peace Settlement Religion nay King and all  These were  Trimming and Temporizing in the Reformation And  Division and Faction among the Courtiers  I'll be very brief in the Account I shall give of these Two unhappy things and yet I desire so to explain the Circumstances and so faithfully to relate the Conduct of the Persons that the Warning it may be to future Ages may be flagrant and the Moral or Improvement may revive with the Story  The Rebellious just now mention'd had been in behalf of or rather on the Pretence of Zeal for the Church and it had been indeed a most dangerous Crisis to have such bold and desperate attempts made in the Infancy of the King's Affairs  Some of the  States Men  who were in the Main real Friends to the  Reformation  and very faithful to the King and his Interest yet intimidated a little by the Dangers they had been in and by the Daily Insolence and Threats of the  Popish  Party who were still very numerous in the Country started very unhappily and in an ill Hour this wretched Opinion  or Notion  viz  That it was too bold an attempt for the King to undertake to make a thorough  Reformation  at once upon the People that it would exasperate the  Roman  Party and as they had powerful Alliances abroad and formidable Numbers at Home they would not only be always Plotting against the publick Peace but that it was too probable they might some time or other get the Start of them and ruine them all and that therefore it were but good  State Policy  to temporize a little to go on by Degrees and to act with  Popery  as some of the good Kings of  Judah  did with Idolatry of whom it was said  They did that which was right in the Sight of the Lord Nevertheless the high Places were not taken away but the People burnt Incense yet in the high Places  Chron XX  In like manner they were for letting the  Reformation  go on gradually leaving such of the  Reliques  of  Popery  as were of less Consequence for a while unreformed admitting a  Mixture of Papists and Protestants into their Councils and Administration that the former might be thereby be engaged by the Court Services and Preferments to embark no more with or encourage the People in their Disaffection Nor did it end in this Proposal of a  motley Ministry  but even a  motley Reformation  was to be the Consequence and the High Church were to be so blended with the low that is to say Papist with Protestant and so much of the  Reliques  of Popery were to have been left in the new Establishment of Religion that as a famous States Man of that Day who had more Sincerity than all of them said meaning the Duke of  Suffolk  They would set up a Religion that was neither Papist nor Protestant that God would not own nor themselves understand  When this Project was laid before the King He caused the ArchBishop of  Canterbury  to read it over to Him But it disgusted Him extremely and when the other Bishops began to  speak in Favour of it the King who had more Courage and Honesty than all of them answered in that memorable Expression of Scripture  Cursed be he that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully  And when another Bishop asked a little tartly  What then must be done Shall we be always fighting about difficult Questions  The King still standing steady to his Principles and shewing an abhorrence of the Cowardice and Treachery of his Courtiers rising up in some Heat replied in the Words of our Saviour  Every Plant which my Heavenly Father has not Planted shall be rooted up  and no Man durst move any thing of that Kind to Him ever after  This Zeal and Courage of the King established the Reformation  This Trimming and Treachery would have sent them all back to Popery  Leaving this History to be closely applied as Occasion shall offer I proceed to the second Thing which  ruined the Peace of that blessed King's Reign and which as I have said let in a  Popish  Pretender upon them in the next and this was    Divisions at Court  Emulation Ambition Avarice and Envy possest the Minds of his Courtiers and the Consequences were these  They ruined and destroyed one another  They brought in the half reformed Courtiers that themselves had spued out letting in their Enemies to support their Factions one against another  Those very Enemies who came in by these Divisions brought in a  Popish  Pretender upon them in the next  Reign  and brought them all to Fire and Faggot  If this were a Parable or Allegory only by which to represent to our  present People the Dangers which might possibly happen upon taking in their Enemies to fortifie and form Interests against their Friends and to support their several Parties one against another it might have been thrown by and disregarded as the Chimera of a scribbling Head which had in it no more than such People generally produce  But as it is a real History the Matters of Fact upon Record and the Truth of them not to be disputed as the Tragical Part which follow'd was acted upon the Stage of our own Country and the Fire and Faggot of their Popish Persecutions smoaked in our own Streets as it was not long ago and the Ruine of those who suffered under it is felt in our Families even to this Day it comes with the greater Energy upon us the Force of it is not to be resisted nor can the Caution given from it be called unjust or improper  Like Causes produce like Consequences in all Ages or at least may do so it may not therefore be improper to look briefly over the Court Divisions of that  Reign  and see how they began how they were carried on and how it came to pass that the best and only Establishment of those Times for a Protestant Succession was overthrown and destroyed meerly and only by the Contention and Divisions of the great Men at Court and in doing this we may take some notice of their Persons  The Great Men at Court in that Day consisted of the Duke of  Somerset  prime Minister Uncle to and Protector of the King Captain General and  Commander  in  Chief  of all his Forces the Duke of  Northumberland  formerly Earl of  Warwick  of the antient Family of  Dudley  Mr  Stanhope  a great Friend and Assistant to the Duke of  Somerset  Mr  Cecil  Secretary of State the Marquiss of  Northampton  Among these it is necessary to give a brief Description of a few The Two contending Factions and which made most stir with their Strife were the two Dukes of  Somerset  and  Northumberland  commonly known in those dangerous Times when People durst not speak plain by the Distinction of Duke  Blue  and Duke  Green  of which I can give no other Account than by Tradition that the one being a  Southern  Title had reference to the Garter of St  George  And the other being a  Northern  Title might have the like to that of St  Andrew  whose Ensigns are the Blue and Green Ribband But I do not find that the Person was ever received as a Knight of that Order  Duke  Blue  had great Personal Merit and was exceedingly beloved both by the King and the People he was an able  States Man  and a very great  Soldier  he had by his Wisdom and Prudence greatly assisted in set  g the Prince upon the Throne  and was his last resort for  Council  for as he had a great Interest among the People by his Fame and among the Nobility by his great Alliances with the best Families so he had a Mind always present to himself in the greatest Exigence and was esteemed to be the best Man of  Council  of that Age especially upon any dangerous Juncture In the Field he was superior to himself if I may so say I mean that there he excelled not only all Mankind but even outdid all his own other Excellencies and this he shew'd at that memorable Battle of  Pinkie  by which as well as on many other Occasions he had in the preceeding Reigns made the  English  Arms as well as his own  Conduct  terrible to the World  Having said thus much of his Person it cannot be omitted because something of it will come necessarily to be mention'd hereafter that he was not more happy in his own  Character  than he was unfortunate in that of his Wife a Woman of a  terrible Spirit insupportably Haughty Turbulent Covetous Treacherous Revengeful and being withal busie and medling in publick Matters push'd her Husband upon the worst Scenes of his Life and which indeed ended in his Ruine I have only to add that as their  Characters  were the Reverse of one another so was the influence they had in the World one being exceedingly beloved and the other universally hated by the People  The Duke  Green  was of a  Character  quite different from the other having very few good Qualities to recommend him the best that could be said of him was that he was of a very great and antient Family famous for Heroes and Men of Gallantry and Courage and was himself a Man of a daring and enterprising Courage But tho' he had on many Occasions shewn his Gallantry in Action yet he was by most thought fitter to Command under another than to lead Armies as General in Chief yet in this it was thought he had the Misfortune to differ from common Fame in the Opinion of himself  He serv'd under Duke  Blue  at the great Battle of  Pinkie  but was very willing to have it said that the great Victory obtained that Day was owing more to his Conduct than that of the General and had sometimes the Vanity to say that if he had had the Command the War would have been carried on more to the King's Advantage however as Duke  Blue  consented afterwards to leave the Conduct of the War to him for one Campaign it did not appear  In a Word tho' they both appear'd Friends to the King and to his Interest and on all Occasions acted with their utmost for his Service yet it was well known they were not cordial Friends to one another but did one another in their Turn all the ill Offices they could till it brought Duke  Blue  first to the Block and Duke  Green  followed in a very little while after the same Way  In the Fate of Duke  Blue  followed several of his fast Friends for Men of such Figure seldom fall alone Mr  Stanhope  Sir  Ralph Vane    and several others were put to Death tho' all innocent being meer  Sacrifices to the political Rage of Duke  Green  and the King himself who lived but a little while after yet lived to be satisfied of their Innocence and to lament in the most moving Terms the fatal Divisions of his Ministers which had brought him to cut off his most faithful Servants and had imposed upon him in a most vile Manner to shut his Ears against the Remonstrances of his best Friends in their Favour the bitter Remembrance of which follow'd the good Prince to his Grave  After the King's Death Duke  Green  who was the chief Favourite of the Successor assumed the Prime Ministry and Management of Affairs But the  Pretender  got ground every Day tho' really more by the Hatred the People bore to Duke  Green  than from any real Disaffection to the Successor at length the Protestant Successor was entirely abandoned by the Nation tho' a Person of the most amiable Perfections most agreeable and engaging Temper and most perfect Virtue in the World  Thus a Popish Pretender was brought in the Protestant Cause was lost and  the Protestant Successor Deposed and Murther'd purely from the Hatred the People bore to the wicked Actions of him who was then Head of the Party whose Conduct was always rash and foolish and who having broken the Unity and Harmony which was before happily carried on thro' all the publick Affairs had divided the Court some one Way some another particularly had taken into the Administration People of quite differing Principles from the King and of views differing from his Interest which it seems he did at all Hazards only to make his Party strong against his Enemy nor was Duke  Blue  but especially his Wife backward in the same unhappy Measures making use of their Power with the King to bring in and keep in several People both in the Army in the Navy and in the Civil Affairs such People as were not Friends to His Majesty's Interest so be it they were Friends to their Party and willing to engage against their Opposers  This being the Practice on both sides they declar'd openly against one another and were openly called by the  Neuters at Court as well as by the People the  Blue Faction  and the  Green Faction  There was indeed another Sort which was called the  third Party  these were headed by Mr  Cecil  one of the Secretaries of State and by the Person who principally managed the King's Treasure whose Name I do not remember but they were too weak to carry on any Design and the King also was prevailed with to discountenance them or at least not to shew them that Favour which they at first expected so that they were able to do little and the  Blue  and  Green  Factions drawing all to themselves these soon lost their principal Adherents who were drawn in to side with one Faction or the other as their Profits or Designs led them on  As for the  Chancellor  he was a weak or rather indolent Person whose Character was not extraordinary and his Body infirm and Duke  Green  having no kindness for him and yet not caring to push directly at him because he thought the King had some kindness for him persuaded him to resign the Seals he having desired to lose his  Place with as little Disgrace as possible The Seals were soon after given to a Person quite in another Interest  From these Dissentions and Divisions at Court says a Reverend Historian of those Times it followed that nothing was seen during that blessed King's Reign but Troubles Commotions and Disquiets both in Church and State till Way was made by the Distractions of the State to overthrow the whole Constitution destroy the Reformation and let in Popery and Persecution in the Reign that followed  It is time to turn to our own Times to which we may make a sudden Transition without letting drop the Memory of what has been said It had questionless been a piece of very happy Advice whoever had given it if some clear sighted Person had in those Days earnestly press'd and advised the StatesMen of King  Edward  to unite in their Duty to the King and their Care of the Commonwealth and not to suffer their Avarice or Ambition their Pride or their Passions to have any share in the Measures they were taking but to carry on the Publick Affairs with Zeal for the good of their Country and  the Interest of their Sovereign fortifying the King's Interest by the good Agreement of his Servants and the Fidelity of his Councellors which had they done they were able enough to have transmitted the Crown to the Protestant Successor after the King's Death in spight of all that  Popery  and  Popish  Interests could do to the contrary For it was even then true that the Interest of the Popish Successor had very little if any Foundation in this Kingdom but what was founded among  Protestants  themselves making good that old Axiome of Policy that  England  can never be ruined or her Liberties destroy'd by any Power other than her own So that it was the Ignorance Weakness and Division of  Protestants  that set the Crown at that Time on the Head of  Popery  not the real Power of the  Papists  Whether there may be any Parallel drawn from those Times to the present is not so much the Design of this Work as it is to caution the greatest Men of the present Age against the Mischiefs of Dividing and Separating themselves into Parties and Factions of any kind as the only fatal thing that can befal them and the whole Kingdom at this Time  and leave the next Reign exposed to the Disaster of a  Popish Successor  The whole Body of the People of  England  seems now to be united under the Reign of King  George  and that Union is settled and confirmed by the steddy Administration of his Majesty's Affairs by a well chosen Ministry Faction is found at present only among the Defeated Party and their Disappointments are made irretrievable only by the Vigilance and Unanimity of his Majesty's Councils and Measures  By the same Rule if that Vigilance and Unanimity abates if some draw one Way some another if the Ministers of State let go the Reins of the Administration and fall out one with another if these Conquerors fall out about dividing the Spoil where is the Strength of the Administration What will all the Victory they now triumph in amount to Faction will quit the routed Party immediately and harbour her hated Head in the Verge of the very Houshold And what will follow Divisions Envy making and strengthening of Parties at  Court  fortifying Interests and supporting themselves with Numbers struggling for Places and bringing in Friends  and thus in a Word the  Civil War  will be transposed from the remote Parts to the very Walls of the King's Palace and which is worst of all to the very inside of those Walls  And not to represent Things in a more dangerous Posture than they really will represent themselves I shall lay down a little the usual Rise and Progress of Court Divisions  Court Divisions generally spring from two Fountains  Avarice  and  Envy  I know there are two softer Words to be given it which are more Courtly indeed but not more significant nor so justly adapted to describe the thing  viz    Ambition  and  Emulation  but I keep to the Terms I think all the Ambition we now see practised may be well styled Avarice and all their Emulation centers in Envy  These creep insensibly into Courts the first Discovery of it we find in the Great Men engrossing Places of vast Profit many of them into one Hand we saw lately a great Man possest of about seven if not more Places of immense Profit and justly dismiss'd for not being content with that  This prompts them to heave and thrust at one another Picquing and Caballing to support themselves and supplant others whether this be the Case among us now or not it is not my Business to enquire it's evident this has frequently been the Case in the  English  Court in former Times and it is as evident and for this Reason I mention it that this Partymaking and dividing at Court never yet failed to overthrow and turn out the Party that's so divided and if this should be the Case now what have we to expect  Wherefore the People of  England  are more than ordinarily concerned to use the utmost Interest they have in the present great Ministers or those to whom the Administration is intrusted to persuade intreat and in short warn them against dividing their Interest  To begin this Persuasion I shall take the Liberty to tell a short Story which I am able to Name the Persons too who were concerned  Soon after the Restoration of King  Charles  the IId when the Civil War was laid asleep by the general Act of Oblivion many of the old RoundHead Party began to appear openly  who had skulkt about for fear of the Revenge of the Cavalier Party when they should come in and who expected to be proscrib'd and excepted as is usual in the general Pardon  One Major  Gladman  an old Soldier and who had been very much concerned in the Governing Party was sitting in a CoffeeHouse in the City smoaking a Pipe when an antient Gentleman in a long Shoulder Belt which was at that Time the Badge of a Cavalier came and sat by him he began very high with him Are not you such a Man Sir Yes Sir replies the Major Then you are one of those Fools Sir says he that have managed this poor Nation after your wretched manner and must give an Account to Heaven for what you have done  We must so Sir replies the Major but Sir since the King has been pleased to give an Act of Oblivion and all these Things are laid asleep Sir it is not the kindest thing Gentlemen can do to us to insult us with it when we have no freedom to reply  Yes yes the Act of Oblivion has buried it says the old Gentleman and I am not going to revive that but  Heaven will call you all to Account for being the most unaccountablest Fools in the World that when He had given you Victory and committed the Nation to your Government and we poor Cavaliers durst not show our Faces in the World you in a shameful and most contemptible manner pulled one another to pieces for the Spoil and giving up all your Advantages brought us in again with your own Hands Are you not a Parcel of Fools  Indeed Sir says the Major you have toucht us in a sore Place if our Divisions had not opened a Door for you it was impossible you could ever have returned  Let all those who God and King  George  have entrusted with any share of the Honour and Trusts of the present Government stand warned by such a Story as this Nothing can wound the present  Interest  of King  George  nothing can give Life to his Enemies nothing can revive the Jacobite Cause in a Word nothing can effectually ruine us now but dividing  Not all the Power of  France  can hurt us we see that cringing and reduced and complying with any Conditions  to get an Alliance with us for their own Preservation  Not all the other Popish Powers of  Europe  can hurt us we see them solliciting and entreating to be admitted into the same Alliance for their Security  Not all the Jacobite Highflying Party at Home we see them reduced and the Pallace of the King crouded with Petitioners begging Reprieves for their principal Leaders to save them from the Scaffold and the Gallows  What then can hurt us what can be capable to weaken our Hands so strengthen'd by Conquest to weaken our Measures directed by such Heads to slacken the Reins of our Administration committed to such nothing but private Feuds and Factions nothing but Divisions among our selves and then no Government is so fixt no King so establish'd no Constitution so well founded but it will undo and overthrow it  Let us go among the High Party and hear what they say and indeed we need go no farther to confirm the Argument what is it has given Life to their dejected Souls brighten'd  their Countenances and put their Expectations again upon the Wing  It was but the other Day that all their broken Reeds having fail'd them they were brought to give up their Cause and to confess they had nothing left to do but to despair  Now they are another People they promise themselves new Scenes flatter themselves with new Hopes and encourage one another to new Mischiefs we see their Leaders meeting in Cabals great Conferences held upon the present Scituation of their Affairs and Measures taken with assurance of Success for the Forming their Interest and Propagating their Cause even to  Avignon  it self the Encouragement is spread and we have Letters from thence which say their Friends in  England  give them Encouragement to look for great Things in their Favour for that say they we are assured there are great Divisions at Court that the  Whigs  are fallen out among themselves that  Argyle  being out on one Hand and  T  d  on the other great Interests are made to bring them in  again which there is some hopes of that on the contrary great Parties are made against them and that by means of these Dissentions the Friends to another Interest are caress'd more than usual for that States Men never value who they take into Business if it be found necessary to support them against their Oppposers  To conclude the best Construction which I can make of the whole Matter is in Favour of this Intelligence from  Avignon    viz  that it is a meer piece of Jacobite News that indeed it is an idle Rumour or a malicious one that it is impossible it should be true and that the Case at Court stands directly thus and no otherwise  viz  That there is an entire Harmony and Unity in every Part of the  Administration  among the  Ministers of State  that there is not so much as the least Jealousie Uneasiness or Misunderstanding among them that a perfect Friendship and good Correspondence spreads it self through the  Minds and  Management  of all the great Men at Court and an exact  Ʋniformity  in their Measures that if there is any Ambition among them it is only in the great Struggle to render their August Master the best Services be most vigilant for his Safety and most vigorous in Opposition to his Enemies the Jacobites  Consequently that all the Rumours spread aborad of  Factions  in the Court and of Divisions into Parties looking this Way and that Way are Chimerical Groundless and of no Value and are not to be regarded otherwise than to let us see to what the Jacobite  Interest  tends what they drive at and what we are to expect from them if ever that fatal Time should come when the  Ministers of State  should break and divide from one another and open the Gaps and Breaches which the Protestant Succession had so happily closed  The Reasons in Particular which I give why I cannot believe any such Rumour and why I must believe that  all these Accounts of  Divisions  among the  Ministry  come from a Wicked Desperate Jacobite Party who desire to sow Strife among us all and expect a Harvest to their Party from it I say the Reasons of this  Opinion  of mine are such as these  Because I take the  Ministry  to be honest Men and their Honesty is engaged  Because I take them to be no Fools and their Senses are engaged  It is no time to flatter great Men and speak fine Words to them because they are in Figure and Authority the Nation is interested in their Conduct and will be injur'd or advantag'd as they behave  We have boasted of them hitherto and hope we have had Reason we have sung their Fame and insulted the Tories when they have attempted to defame and lessen them on any Account whatever we have rested upon them in a full expectation of their answering the best Things we could say  We have upbraided the  Tories  with their corrupt Administration their gratifying their Avarice their Ambition their Revenge with betraying their Queen and Country and Posterity to push their separate Interests After we had run a Length of Reproaches upon their want of Honesty their Vices their falshood to their Oaths their exposing their Country to  French  and  Popish  Tyranny and their being of mercenary Turncoat Principles doing all this to serve the  French  who had bought them and the Clergy who had debauch'd the I say after we had loaded them with all that they deserved on this Account how did we at last laugh at them for Fools in their Politicks weakening and destroying their new Schemes and blowing up all their own  Mines  by breaking among themselves and dividing into Factions and Parties  Did we not tell them they were whetting the Knives that would cut their own Throats and building the Scaffolds for their own Execution Did we not set still and laugh at them  for opening the Gaps at which we told them we the  Whigs  would enter and blow them all up Did we not frequently say that tho' they were such Knaves as to design the  Pretender  yet they were withal such Fools as to bring in the House of  Hanover  for us by the meer Madness of their Measures  What could the House of  Hanover  before the King's Accession desire more or what News could they have desir'd more agreeable more satisfactory than that their Enemies in the late Ministry were divided that they were falling out for Places and setting up Factions in the Court one against another for engrossing the  Administration  Was not this to tell them in plain Words that they were not fit for the Post they were in and that nothing was to be apprehended from them but that whenever the Crown should descend they would either break quite in Pieces and vanish into nothing leaving the Way open for their Enemies to come in without Resistance or that they would be tripping up one another's Heels to see who should be foremost in Sacrificing the rest to the  Successor  Nor were we in the Wrong in our Judgment for just thus it was and the Event has proved them as great Fools in their Dividing as they could be Knaves in their first Uniting  Will it be less true in the present Case if we could believe any thing of the Rumours that are spread Can the Honesty or the Senses of the present Ministry be spoken of with the least Satisfaction if they should act thus Would they not be the most Unaccountable of all Men that ever pretended to the Use of Reason and the worst of all Lunaticks It cannot therefore be it must all be a Slander an abominable cursed high Church Slander To tell us of a  Ma  Faction and an  Arg  Faction and a  Wa  le  Party it must be regarded like the Gasconades of the  Tories  when they told us of the  Earl  of  Marr  's mighty Forces the terrible Fortifications he had raised about  Perth  the vast Levies making for him abroad and the great Succours he had received from  France  which appeared at last to be only a great Mist that wasted before the  Sun  a great Croud which separated and disappeared  at the Approach of but Ten Thousand Men  The Circumstances of the present Ministry confirm us in this Opinion also they have the most happy  Settlement  in their Hands that ever this Nation enjoy'd secur'd by victorious Troops a steddy and unanimous Parliament and an easie satisfied People they are supported by a wise and magnanimous Prince strong in his Interest abroad growing in the Affections of the People at home Rebellion like the Dragon under the Feet of St  George  is conquer'd and lies grovelling in the Dust  Jacobitism  is reduc'd to a  State  of  Despair    Popery  has laid by its Pretensions and suppliant  France  seeks Aid at our Court against her own  State  Factions  The present  Ministry  have nothing to wish which they do not enjoy they have nothing to do but to Congratulate one another and enjoy in Common the full Favour of their Prince do their Duty and receive the Reward of their Fidelity  Can it be possible then that these Men should fall out with one another  Can there be Room among them for Ambition or Envy or Faction so much as to put a Foot in no 'tis impossible Do they not swim in a full Sea of the King's Bounty Are not all their Foes made their Footstool Have they not all that one would think Avarice or Ambition could prompt them to ask What can they without blushes desire of their Country more than they enjoy  For these Men to fall out to divide into Factions and Parties what would it be but to tell the World that they are not the Men they have been taken for that however they have made Pretences to be disinterested and to have serv'd King  George  purely for the Justice of his Cause and the good of their Country that yet they are true  States Men  that they are of the same Mold with others that went before them that their aim has been all along their own Interest the satisfying their own voratious Appetites and the most unbounded Avarice that Pride and the worst sort of Ambition has been the Helm that steers all their Actions and that nothing  but to be above one another can make Peace among them in a Word that every Man wants to be prime  Minister  and cannot bear to see any  Man  have a Share of Power or of Favour equal with himself in which they must make good Mr  Dryden  's saying reverse  viz  Courtiers of every Party are the same  For these Men to divide and bandy against one another as it has been scandalously said of them would be to tell the World they have no value for King  George  no regard to his Interest no concern for his Safety or his Family that they serve Him only for what they can get by Him and in Hopes of getting the supreme Management under Him and care not what Hazard they run of his Interest to secure their own For this Reason one cannot without the greatest Contempt of their Persons and Designs and thinking them the most Perfidious Generation of Men in the World I say one  cannot  so much as entertain a Notion of their being any ways Guilty  Should Division and Faction creep in among the present  Mannagers  of Affairs what must we expect indeed what may we not expect but that the whole Party should divide as they divide and where will this end  If a Kingdom divided against its self cannot stand  how shall a Party divided against it self be supported And if this present  Interest  divide again what is before them but that the  Interest  of the  Tories  and the  Pretender  which has been broken and trampled under Foot purely by the Harmony and Unanimity of  Councils  with which His Majesty's Affairs have been bless'd shall revive and overwhelm us all United as we were  none can say  we were not in Danger and next to God's directing Providence nothing but the Vigilance and steddy Conduct of the King and his Ministry united together Heart and Hand to surprize and circumvent the Enemy render'd their too well laid Designs abortive  If that Unity is broken if the Eyes that should watch for the publick  Safety are employed in an envious Glancing at one another watching their private Advantages to supplant and displace establish and bring in as their own ambitious Views direct what will become of the publick Interest Who will look out for that And how will the Ship of State run on Ground and split upon the Rocks while the Pilots forget to  Steer  and are falling out among themselves  The first Step which Party Men generally take to support themselves when they lay Designs one against another is to strengthen themselves with  Friends  and  Dependents  who shall be ready at all Times to serve and support them especially where  any thing  that may injure them is to be passed by Votes To do this they make use of their  Interest  with the  Sovereign  to recommend and bring such  Persons  into publick  Employment  as well to keep others out as to fortifie their  own Interest  for Numbers has always  been esteemed a great Thing at Court  To do this we always find they make no scruple to court mutually in their turn I say to court the Party that are out who they bring into play upon Pretence of their being turn'd or of having promised to be directed  This was what the Courtiers did in King  William  's Time when the Lord  Havershame  described it by that unhappy but significant Word a  Motley Ministry  and how far that Motley Ministry went towards ruining that Prince's Affairs is too recent in Memory to be forgot How far the like Folly would go to ruine our present Affairs we ought to tremble to think of  When the Parties thus bring in their Enemies Two Things frequently follow and indeed seldom fail  That they cannot when they find their mistake get them out again  That they often master and throw out those that brought them in  We need not look far back for Examples of this Kind the People now at Court know too much of this Truth to have any occasion to be put in Mind of it The Court Revolution of is an eminent Instance of it and to that they are referred  The Sum of the Matter is that it cannot without most uncommon and most injurious Reflections upon the present Administration be suggested that there are any Misunderstandings Dividings or Factions among them their Honesty will not permit it their Senses must be their Protection against it they cannot do it without being Fools to themselves Traytors to King  George  and  Knaves to their Country and for this Reason I conclude that it is all false a meer Rumour raised by their Enemies to amuse the World scandalize the Government and bouy up their own sinking Party  If it should appear to be otherwise you shall hear farther  FINIS  BOOKS Printed for J Baker at the Black Boy in PaterNosterRow  THE History of the Reign of King  Charles the first  containing a more particular and impartial
