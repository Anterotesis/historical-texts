 HYMNS AND SACRED POEMS  Published by  JOHN WESLEY  M A Fellow of  Lincoln  College  Oxford  AND  CHARLES WESLEY  M A Student of  ChristChurch    Oxford    Let the Word of  CHRIST  dwell in You richly in all Wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and Hymns and Spiritual Songs singing with Grace in your Hearts to the Lord  Col iii  LONDON  Printed by WILLIAM STRAHAN and sold by JAMES HUTTON Bookseller at the  Bible  and  Sun  without  TempleBar  and at Mr BRAY's a Brazier in  LittleBritain  MDCCXXXIX  THE PREFACE  SOME Verses it may be observ'd in the following Collection were wrote upon the Scheme of the Mystick Divines And these 'tis own'd we haa once in great Veneration as the best Explainers of the Gospel of CHRIST But we are now convinced that we therein  greatly err'd not knowing the Scriptures neither the Power of  GOD And because this is an Error which many serious Minds are sooner or later exposed to and which indeed most easily besets those who seek the LORD JESUS in Sincerity we believe ourselves indispensably obliged in the Presence of GOD and Angels and Men to declare wherein  we apprehend those Writers Not to teach  the Truth as it is in JESUS  And first we apprehend them to lay Another Foundation They are carefull indeed to pull down our own Works and to prove that  by the DEEDS of the Law shall no flesh be justified  But why is this Only  to establish our own Righteousness  in the place of our own Works They speak largely and well against expecting to be accepted of GOD for our Virtuous Actions And then teach That we are to be accepted For our Virtuous Habits or Tempers Still the Ground of our Acceptance is placed  in ourselves  The Difference is only this Common Writers suppose we are to be justified for the Sake of our Outward Righteousness These suppose we are to be justified for the Sake of our Inward Righteousness Whereas in truth we are no more justified for the sake of one than of the other For neither our own Inward nor Outward Righteousness is the Ground of our Justification Holiness of Heart as well as Holiness of Life is not the Cause but the Effect of  it The Sole Cause of our Acceptance with GOD or That for the Sake of which on the Account of which we are accepted is the Righteousness and the Death of CHRIST who fulfilled GOD's Law and died in our Stead And even the Condition of it is not as they suppose our Holiness either of Heart of Life But our Faith Alone Faith contradistinguish'd from Holiness as well as from Good Works Other Foundation therefore can no Man lay without being an Adversary to CHRIST and his Gospel than Faith Alone Faith though necessarily producing both yet not including either Good Works or Holiness  But supposing them to have laid the Foundation right the Manner of building thereon which they advise is quite opposite to that prescribed by CHRIST He commands to  build up one another  They advise "To the Desert to the Desert and GOD will build you up" Numberless are the Commendations that occur in all their Writings not of Retirement intermix'd with Conversation but of an intire Seclusion from Men perhaps for  Months or Years in order to purify the Soul Whereas according to the Judgment of our Lord and the Writings of his Apostles it is only when we are  knit together  that we  have Nourishment from Him and increase with the Increase of GOD  Neither is there any time when the weakest Member can say to the strongest or the strongest to the weakest "  I have no need of Thee  " Accordingly our Blessed Lord when his Disciples were in their weakest State sent them forth not alone but  Two by Two  When they were strengthen'd a little not by Solitude but by abiding with him and one another he commanded them to  wait  not separate but  being assembled together for the Promise of the Father  And  they were all with one Accord in one Place  when they received the Gift of the Holy Ghost Express mention is made in the same Chapter that when  there were added unto them Three Thousand Souls all that believed were together and continued stedfastly  not only  in the Apostles Doctrine  but also  in fellowship and in breaking of Bread  and in praying  with one Accord  Agreeable  to which is the Account the Great Apostle gives of the Manner which he had been taught of GOD  for the perfecting of the Saints for the edifying of the Body of CHRIST  even to the end of the World And according to St  Paul    all  who will ever  come in the Unity of the Faith unto a perfect Man unto the Measure of the Stature of the Fulness of CHRIST  must together  grow up into him From whom the whole Body fitly join'd together and compacted  or strengthen'd  by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual Working in the Measure of every part maketh Increase of the Body unto the Edifying of itself in Love  Ephesians iv  So widely distant is the Manner of Building up Souls in CHRIST taught by St  Paul  from that taught by the Mysticks Nor do they differ as to the Foundation or the Manner of Building thereon more than they do with Regard to the Superstructure For the Religion these Authors wou'd edify us in is Solitary  Religion If Thou wilt be Perfect say they "trouble not thyself about Outward Works It is better to work Virtues in the Will He hath attain'd the True Resignation who hath estranged himself from all Outward Works that GOD may work inwardly in him without any turning to Outward Things These are the true Worshippers who worship GOD in Spirit and in Truth" For Contemplation is with them the fulfilling of the Law even a Contemplation that "consists in a Cessation of all Works"  Directly opposite to this is the Gospel of CHRIST Solitary Religion is not to be found there "Holy Solitaries" is a Phrase no more consistent with the Gospel than Holy Adulterers The Gospel of CHRIST knows of no Religion but Social no Holiness but Social Holiness  Faith working by Love  is the length and breadth and depth and height of Christian Perfection  This Commandment have we from CHRIST that he who love GOD love his Brother also  And that we manifest our Love  by doing good unto all Men especially to them that are of the Household of Faith  And in truth whosoever loveth his Brethren not in Word only but as CHRIST loved him cannot but be  zealous of Good Works  He feels in his Soul a burning restless Desire of spending and being spent for them  My Father  will he say  worketh hitherto and I work  And at all possible Opportunities he is like his Master  going about doing good    This then is the Way Walk Ye in it whosoever Ye are that have believed in his Name Ye know  Other Foundation can no Man lay than that which is laid even JESUS CHRIST  Ye feel that  by Grace Ye are  saved thro' Faith saved from Sin by CHRIST form'd  in your Hearts  and from Fear by  his Spirit bearing Witness with your Spirit that Ye are the Sons of GOD  Ye are taught of GOD  not to forsake the assembling of yourselves together as the Manner of some is  but to instruct admonish exhort reprove comfort confirm and every Way  build up one another Ye  have an Unction from the Holy One  that teacheth you to renounce any other or higher Perfection than  Faith working by Love  Faith  zealous of Good Works  Faith  as it hath opportunity doing good unto all Men As Ye have therefore received JESUS CHRIST the LORD so Walk ye in Him Rooted and built up in Him and stablish'd in the Faith and abounding therein  more and more Only  beware lest any Man spoil you thro' Philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of Men after the rudiments of the World and not after CHRIST  For  Ye are complete in Him He is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending the first and the last  Only  continue in  Him  grounded and settled and be not moved away from the Hope of the Gospel And when CHRIST who is our Life shall appear then shall Ye also appear with him in Glory  THE CONTENTS  PART I  EUpolis  's Hymn to the

of Being Source of Light  With unfading Beauties bright  Fulness Goodness rolling round  Thy own fair Orb without a Bound  Whether Thee thy Supplicants call  Truth or Good or One or All  Ei  or  Iao  Thee we hail  Essence that can never fail  Grecian  or  Barbaric  Name  Thy stedfast Being still the same  Thee when Morning greets the Skies  With rosy Cheeks and humid Eyes  Thee when sweetdeclining Day  Sinks in purple Waves away  Thee will I sing O Parent  Jove  And teach the World to praise and love  Yonder azure Vault on high  Yonder blue low liquid Sky  Earth on its firm Basis plac'd  And with circling Waves embrac'd  All Creating Pow'r confess  All their mighty Maker bless  Thou shak'st all Nature with thy Nod  Sea Earth and Air confess the God  Yet does thy pow'rful Hand sustain  Both Earth and Heaven both Firm and Main  Scarce can our daring Thought arise  To thy Pavilion in the Skies  Nor can  Plato's  self declare  The Bliss the Joy the Rapture there  Barren above Thou dost not reign  But circled with a glorious Train  The Sons of God the Sons of Light  Ever joying in thy Sight  For Thee their silver Harps are strung  Ever beauteous ever young  Angelic Forms their Voices raise  And thro' Heav'n's Arch resound thy Praise  The Feather'd Souls that swim the Air  And bathe in liquid Ether there  The Lark Precentor of their Choir  Leading them higher still and higher  Listen and learn th' angelic Notes  Repeating in their warbling Throats  And ere to soft Repose they go  Teach them to their Lords below  On the green Turf their mossy Nest  The Ev'ning Anthem swells their Breast  Thus like thy Golden Chain from high  Thy Praise unites the Earth and Sky  Source of Light Thou bidst the Sun  On his burning Axles run  The Stars like Dust around him fly  And shew the Area of the Sky  He drives so swift his Race above  Mortals can't perceive him move  So smooth his Course oblique or strait  Olympus  shakes not with his Weight  As the Queen of solemn Night  Fills at his Vase her Orb of Light  Imparted Lustre Thus we see  The solar Virtue shines by Thee  Eiresione  we'll no more  Imaginary Pow'r adore  Since Oil and Wool and chearing Wine  And Lifesustaining Bread is thine  Thy Herbage O Great  Pan  sustains  The Flocks that graze our  Attic  Plains  The Olive with fresh Verdure crown'd  Rises pregnant from the Ground  At thy Command it shoots and springs  And a thousand Blessings brings  Minerva  only is thy Mind  Wisdom and Bounty to Mankind  The fragrant Thyme the bloomy Rose  Herb and Flow'r and Shrub that grows  On  Thessalian Tempe's  Plain  Or where the rich  Sabeans  reign  That treat the Taste or Smell or Sight  For Food for Med'cine or Delight  Planted by thy Parent Care  Spring and smile and flourish there  O ye Nurses of soft Dreams  Reedy Brooks and winding Streams  Or murm'ring o'er the Pebbles sheen  Or sliding thro' the Meadows green  Or where thro' matted Sedge you creep  Travelling to your Parent Deep  Sound his Praise by whom you rose  That Sea which neither ebbs nor flows  O ye immortal Woods and Groves  Which the enamour'd Student loves  Beneath whose venerable shade  For Thought and friendly Converse made  Fam'd  Hecadem  old Hero lies  Whose Shrine is shaded from the Skies  And thro' the Gloom of silent Night  Projects from far its trembling Light  You whose Roots descend as low  As high in Air your Branches grow  Your leafy Arms to Heav'n extend  Bend your Heads in Homage bend  Cedars and Pines that wave above  And the Oak belov'd of  Jove  Omen Monster Prodigy  Or nothing are or  Jove  from Thee  Whether various Nature play  Or reinvers'd thy Will obey  And to Rebel Man declare  Famine Plague or Wasteful War  Laugh ye Profane who dare despise  The threatning Vengeance of the Skies  Whilst the Pious on his Guard  Undismay'd is still prepar'd  Life or Death his Mind's at rest  Since what Thou send'st must needs be best  No Evil can from Thee proceed  'Tis only Suffer'd not Decreed  Darkness is not from the Sun  Nor mount the Shades till he is gone  Then does Night obscene arise  From  Erebus  and fill the Skies  Fantastic Forms the Air invade  Daughters of Nothing and of Shade  Can we forget thy Guardian Care  Slow to punish prone to spare  Thou brak'st the haughty  Persian's  Pride  That dar'd old Ocean's Pow'r deride  Their Shipwrecks strew'd th'  Eubean  Wave  At  Marathon  they found a Grave  O ye blest  Greeks  who there expir'd  For  Greece  with pious Ardor fir'd  What Shrines or Altars shall we raise  To secure your Endless Praise  Or need we Monuments supply  To rescue what can never die  And yet a Greater Hero far  Unless Great  Socrates  could err  Shall rise to bless some future Day  And teach to live and teach to pray  Come Unknown Instructor come  Our leaping Hearts shall make Thee room  Thou with  Jove  our Vows shalt share  Of  Jove  and Thee We are the Care  O Father King whose heav'nly Face  Shines serene on All thy Race  We thy Magnificence adore  And thy wellknown Aid implore  Nor vainly for thy Help we call  Nor can we want For thou art All  SOLITUDE From the  Latin    SOLITUDE where shall I find  Thee pleasing to the thoughtful Mind  Sweet Delights to Thee belong  Untasted by the vulgar Throng  Weary of Vice and Noise I flee  Sweetest Comforter to Thee  Here the Mild and Holy Dove  Peace inspires and Joy and Love  Thy unmolested silent Shade  No tumultuous Sounds invade  No Stain of Guilt is seen in Thee  To soil thy spotless Purity  Here the smiling Fields around  Softest Harmony resound  Here with Angel Quires combin'd  The Lord of his own peaceful Mind  Glides thro' Life from Business far  And noisy Strise and eating Care  Here retir'd from Pomp and State  The envy'd Torment of the Great  Innocent he leads his Days  Far from giddy Thirst of Praise  Here his Accounts with studious Care  Preparing for the last great Bar  He weeps the Stains of Guilt away  And ripens for Eternal Day  Hoarded Wealth desire who please  Tow'rs and gilded Palaces  Fraudless Silence may I find  Solitude and Peace of Mind  To all the busy World unknown  Seen and lov'd by God alone  Ye Rich ye Learn'd ye Great confess  This in Life is Happiness  To live unknown to all abroad  To myself only and my GOD  The Mystery of Life  I  SO many Years I've seen the Sun  And call'd these Eyes and Hands my own  A thousand little Acts I've done  And Childhood have and Manhood known  O what is Life and this dull Round  To tread why was a Spirit bound  II  So many airy Draughts and Lines  And warm Excursions of the Mind  Have fill'd my Soul with great Designs  While Practice grovel'd far behind  O what is Thought and where withdraw  The Glories which my Fancy saw  III  So many tender Joys and Woes  Have on my quiv'ring Soul had Pow'r  Plain Life with height'ning Passions rose  The Boast or Burden of their Hour  O what is All we feel why fled  Those Pains and Pleasures o'er my Head  IV  So many human Souls Divine  Some at one Interview display'd  Some oft and freely mixt with mine  In lasting Bonds my Heart have laid  O what is Friendship why imprest  On my weak wretched dying Breast  V  So many wondrous Gleams of Light  And gentle Ardors from above  Have made me sit like Seraph bright  Some Moments on a Throne of Love  O what is Virtue why had I  Who am so low a Taste so high  VI  Ere long when Sov'reign Wisdom wills  My Soul an unknown Path shall tread  And strangely leave who strangely fills  This Frame and waft me to the Dead  O what is Death'tis Life's last Shore  Where Vanities are vain no more  Where all Pursuits their Goal obtain  And Life is all retouch'd again  Where in their bright Result shall rise  Thoughts Virtues Friendships Griefs and Joys  EPITAPH  ASK not who ended here his Span  His Name Reproach and Praise was Man  Did no great Deeds adorn his Course  No Deed of His but shew'd him worse  One Thing was great which GOD supply'd  He suffer'd Human Lifeand Dy'd  What Points of Knowledge did he gain  That Life was sacred alland Vain  Sacred how high and vain how low  He knew not here but dy'd to know  VIRTUE Altered from  Herbert    I  SWEET Day so cool so calm so bright  The Bridal of the Earth and Sky  The Dew shall weep thy Fall to Night  For Thou with all thy Sweets must die  II  Sweet Rose so fragrant and so brave  Dazling the rash Beholder's Eye  Thy Root is ever in its Grave  And Thou with all thy Sweets must die  III  Sweet Spring so beauteous and so gay  Storehouse where Sweets unnumber'd lie  Not long thy fading Glories stay  But Thou with all thy Sweets must die  IV  Only a Sweet and Virtuous Mind  When Nature all in Ruins lies  When Earth and Heav'n a Period find  Begins a Life that never dies  Upon list'ning to the Vibrations of a Clock  INstructive Sound I'm now convinc'd by Thee  Time in its Womb may bear Infinity  How the past Moment dies and throbs no more  What Worlds of Parts compose the rolling Hour  The least of these a serious Care demands  For tho' they're little yet they're Golden Sands  By some great Deeds distinguish'd all in Heav'n  For the same End to me by Number giv'n  Cease Man to lavish Sums thou ne'er hast told  Angels tho' Deathless dare not be so bold  DOOMSDAY From  Herbert    I  "COME to Judgment come away"  Hark I hear the Angel say  Summoning the Dust to rise  "Hast resume and lift your Eyes  "Hear ye Sons of Adam hear  "Man before thy GOD appear"  II  Come to Judgment come away  This the Last the Dreadful Day  Sov'reign Author Judge of all  Dust obeys thy quick'ning Call  Dust no other Voice will heed  Thine the Trump that wakes the Dead  III  Come to Judgment come away  Lingring Man no longer stay  Thee let Earth at length restore  Pris'ner in her Womb no more  Burst the Barriers of the Tomb  Rise to meet thy instant Doom  IV  Come to Judgment come away  Wide disperst howe'er ye stray  Lost in Fire or Air or Main  Kindred Atoms meet again  Sepulchred where'er ye rest  Mix'd with Fish or Bird or Beast  V  Come to Judgment come away  Help O CHRIST thy Work's Decay  Man is out of Order hurl'd  Parcel'd out to all the World  Lord thy broken Concert raise  And the Musick shall be Praise  SPIRITUAL SLUMBER From the  German    I  O Thou who all things canst controul  Chase this dead Slumber from my Soul  With Joy and Fear with Love and Awe  Give me to keep thy perfect Law  II  O may one Beam of thy blest Light  Pierce thro' dispel the Shades of Night  Touch my cold Breast with heav'nly Fire  With holy conq'ring Zeal inspire  III  For Zeal I sigh for Zeal I pant  Yet heavy is my Soul and faint  With Steps unwav'ring undismay'd  Give me in all thy Paths to tread  IV  With outstretch'd Hands and streaming Eyes  Oft I begin to grasp the Prize  I groan I strive I watch I pray  But ah how soon it dies away  V  The deadly Slumber soon I feel  Afresh upon my Spirit steal  Rise Lord stir up thy quick'ning Pow'r  And wake me that I sleep no more  VI  Single of Heart O may I be  Nothing may I desire but Thee  Far far from me the World remove  And all that holds me from thy Love  ZEAL  I  DEAD as I am and cold my Breast  Untouch'd by Thee Celestial Zeal  How shall I sing th' unwonted Guest  How paint the Joys I cannot feel  II  Assist me Thou at whose Command  The Heart exults from Earth set free  'Tis Thine to raise the drooping Hand  Thine to confirm the feeble Knee  III  'Tis Zeal must end this inward Strife  Give me to know That Warmth Divine  Thro' all my Verse thro' all my Life  The Active Principle shall shine  IV  Where shall we find its high Abode  To Heav'n the Sacred Ray aspires  With ardent Love embraces GOD  Parent and Object of its Fires  V  There its peculiar Influence known  In Breasts Seraphic learns to glow  Yet darted from th' Eternal Throne  It sheds a chearing Light below  VI  Thro' Earth diffus'd the Active Flame  Intensely for GOD's Glory burns  And always mindful whence it came  To Heav'n in ev'ry Wish returns  VII  Yet vain the fierce Enthusiast's Aim  With This to sanctify his Cause  To skreen beneath this Awful Name  The persecuting Sword he draws  VIII  In vain the mad Fanatick's Dreams  To This mysteriously pretend  On Fancy built his airy Schemes  Or slight the Means or drop the End  IX  Where Zeal holds on its even Course  Blind Rage and Bigotry retires  Knowledge assists not checks its Force  And Prudence guides not damps its Fires  X  Resistless then it wins its Way  Yet deigns in humble Hearts to dwell  The humble Hearts confess its Sway  And pleas'd the strange Expansion feel  XI  Superior far to mortal Things  In grateful Extasy they own  Such antedated Heav'n it brings  That Zeal and Happiness are one  XII  Now vary'd Deaths their Terrors spread  Now threat'ning Thousands rageIn vain  Nor Tortures can arrest its Speed  Nor Worlds its Energy restrain  XIII  That Energy which quells the Strong  Which cloaths with Strength the abject Weak  Looses the stamm'ring Infant's Tongue  And bids the Sons of Thunder speak  XIV  While Zeal its heav'nly Influence sheds  What Light o'er  Moses'  Visage plays  It wings th'immortal Prophet's Steeds  And brightens fervent  Stephen  's Face  XV  Come then bright Flame my Breast inspire  To me to me be Thou but giv'n  Like them I'll mount my Car of Fire  Or view from Earth an op'ning Heav'n  XVI  Come then if mighty to redeem  CHRIST purchas'd thee with Blood Divine  Come Holy Zeal For Thou thro' Him  JESUS Himself thro' Thee is Mine  On Reading Mons  r    de RENTY  's Life  WE deem the Saints from mortal Flesh releas'd  With brighter Day and bolder Raptures blest  Sense now no more precludes the distant Thought  And naked Souls now feel the GOD they sought  But thy great Soul which walk'd with GOD on Earth  Can scarce be nearer by that second Birth  By Change of Place dull Bodies may improve  But Spirits to their Bliss advance by Love  Thy Change insensible brought no Surprize  Inur'd to Innocence and Paradise  For Earth not Heav'n thou thro' a Glass didst view  The Glass was Love and Love no Evil knew  But in all Places only Heav'n did shew  Canst Thou Love more when from a Body freed  Which so much Life so little had of Need  So pure it seem'd for This alone design'd  To usher forth the Virtues of the Mind  From Nature's Chain from Earthly Dross set free  One only Appetite remained in Thee  That Appetite it mourn'd but once deny'd  For when it ceas'd from serving GOD it dy'd  VANITY From  Herbert    I  THE fleet Astron'mer travels o'er  The Spheres with his sagacious Mind  Their Stations views from Door to Door  As if to purchase he design'd  Thro' all their circling Orbs he goes  And all their mazy Wandrings knows  II  The nimble Diver with his Side  Cuts thro' the working Waves his Way  To fetch the Pearl which GOD did hide  On purpose from the View of Day  That He might save his Life and hers  Whose Pride the costly Danger wears  III  The subtle Chymist can divest  Gay Nature of her various Hue  Stript of her thousand Forms confest  She stands and naked to his View  At Distance other Suitors stand  Her inmost Stores wait his Command  IV  What has not Man sought out and found  But GOD Who yet his glorious Law  Plants in us mellowing the Ground  With Show'rs and Frost with Love and Awe  Poor busy foolish Man For Death  In Fire and Air and Sea and Land  Thro' Heav'n above and Earth beneath  Thou seek'st but missest Life at hand  FAREWELL to the WORLD From the  French    I  WORLD adieu Thou real Cheat  Oft have thy deceitful Charms  Fill'd my Heart with fond Conceit  Foolish Hopes and false Alarms  Now I see as clear as Day  How thy Follies pass away  II  Vain thy entertaining Sights  False thy Promises renew'd  All the Pomp of thy Delights  Does but flatter and delude  Thee I quit for Heav'n above  Object of the noblest Love  III  Farewell Honour's empty Pride  Thy own nice uncertain Gust  If the least Mischance betide  Lays thee lower than the Dust  Worldly Honours end in Gall  Rise to Day to Morrow fall  IV  Foolish Vanity farewell  More inconstant than the Wave  Where thy soothing Fancies dwell  Purest Tempers they deprave  He to whom I fly from Thee  JESUS CHRIST shall set me free  V  Never shall my wand'ring Mind  Follow after fleeting Toys  Since in GOD alone I find  Solid and substantial Joys  Joys that never overpast  Thro' Eternity shall last  VI  LORD how happy is a Heart  After Thee while it aspires  True and faithful as Thou art  Thou shalt answer its Desires  It shall see the glorious Scene  Of thy Everlasting Reign  GIDDINESS From  Herbert    I  O What a Thing is Man from Rest  How widely distant and from Pow'r  Some twenty sev'ral Men at least  He seems he is each sev'ral Hour  II  Heav'n his sole Treasure now he loves  But let a tempting Thought creep in  His Coward Soul he soon reproves  That starts t' admit a pleasing Sin  III  Eager he rushes now to War  Inglorious now dissolves in Ease  Wealth now engrosses all his Care  And lavish now he scorns Increase  IV  A stately Dome he raises now  But soon the Dome his Change shall feel  See level lies its lofty Brow  Crush'd by the Whirlwind of his Will  V  O what were Man if his Attire  Still vary'd with his varying Mind  If we his ev'ry new Desire  Stamp'd on his alt'ring Form could find  VI  Could each one see his Neighbour's Heart  Brethren and Social made in vain  All would disband and range apart  And Man detest the Monster Man  VII  If GOD refuse our Heart to turn  Vain will his first Creation be  O make us daily Or we spurn  Our own Salvation Lord and Thee  To a FRIEND in LOVE  ACCEPT dear Youth a sympathizing Lay  The only Tribute pitying Love can pay  Tho' vain the Hope thine Anguish to asswage  Charm down Desire or calm fierce Passion's Rage  Yet still permit me in thy Griefs to grieve  Relief to offer if I can't relieve  Near thy sick Couch with fond Concern t' attend  And reach out Cordials to my Dying Friend  Poor hapless Youth what Words can ease thy Pain  When Reason pleads and Wisdom cries in vain  Can feeble Verse impetuous Nature guide  Or stem the Force of blind Affection's Tide  If Reason checks or Duty disallows  "Reason you cry and Duty are my Foes  "Religion's Dictates ineffectual prove  "And GOD Himself's Impertinence in Love  What art Thou Love Thou strange mysterious Ill  Whom none aright can know tho' all can seel  From careless Sloth thy dull Existence flows  And feeds the Fountain whence itself arose  Silent its Waves with baleful Influence roll  Damp the young Mind and sink th' aspiring Soul  Poison its Virtues all its Pow'rs restrain  And blast the Promise of the future Man  To Thee curst Fiend the captive Wretch consign'd  "His Passions rampant and his Reason blind  Reason Heav'n's great Vicegerent dares disown  And place a Foolish Idol in its Throne  Or wildly raise his frantic Raptures higher  And pour out Blasphemies at thy Desire  At thy Desire he bids a Creature shine  He decks a Worm with Attributes Divine  Hers to Angelic Beauties dares prefer  "Angels are painted fair to look like Her  Before her Shrine the lowly Suppliant laid  Adores the Idol that Himself has made  From her Almighty Breath his Doom receives  Dies by her Frown as by her Smile he lives  Supreme she reigns in allsufficient State  To her he bows from her expects his Fate  "Heav'n in her Love Damnation in her Hate  He rears unhallow'd Altars to her Name  Where Lust lights up a black polluted Flame  Where Sighs impure as impious Incense rise  Himself the Priest his Heart the Sacrifice  And thus GOD's Sacred Word his Horrid Pray'r supplies  "Center of All Perfection Source of Bliss  "In whom thy Creaure lives and moves and is  "Save or I perish hear my humble Pray'r  "Spare thy poor ServantO in Mercy spare  "Thou

mystic Pow'rs of Love  VIII  Yet ask not in mere Ease and Pomp  Of Ghostly Gifts to shine  Till Death the Lownesses of Man  And decent Griefs are Thine  AFFLICTION From  Herbert    I  WHEN first Thou didst entice my Heart  To Thee I thought the Service brave  So many Joys I for my Part  Set down besides what I might have  Out of my Stock of natural Delights  Augmented by thy gracious Benefits  II  I view'd thy Furniture so fine  So gay so rich and All for Me  Strongly it spoke the Hand Divine  And lur'd my ravish'd Soul to Thee  Such Stars I counted mine both Heav'n and Earth  Paid me my Wages in a World of Mirth  III  What Pleasures could I want who serv'd  A King where Joys my Fellows were  Still my fond Hopes no Place reserv'd  For pining Grief or anxious Fear  Thus did my simple Soul thy Yoke embrace  And made her Youth and Fierceness seek thy Face  IV  At first Thou gav'st me Sweetnesses  And strew'dst with Flow'rs the narrow Way  Smoothly my Soul sunk down to Peace  My ev'ry joyous Month was  May  But with my Years Sorrow did twist and grow  And made a Party unawares for Woe  V  My Flesh chastis'd with tort'ring Pain  My Soul and Sickness clave my Bones  Pale Agues dwelt in ev'ry Vein  And sadly tun'd my Breath to Groans  Sorrow was all my Soul I scarce perceiv'd  But by the Pains I suffer'd that I liv'd  VI  Health's slowlylingring vain Return  A far severer Loss attends  Sudden my ravish'd Life I mourn  I lose it in my dying Friends  Defenceless now my ev'ry Comfort fled  While Grief's whole Sea is empty'd on my Head  VII  How Thou wilt now thy Servant use  Not one of all my Books can say  On thy ignobler Works I muse  And wish like them my GOD t' obey  Blest could I emulate the lifeless Mass  Flow like the Stream or flourish like the Grass  VIII  Yet must I tho' opprest submit  Strongly my Mis'ry to sustain  Or I will now the Service quit  And strait some other Master gain  Ah my dear Lord tho' I am clean forgot  Let me not love Thee if I love Thee not  FRAILTY From the same  I  LORD how in Silence I despise  The giddy Worldling's Snare  This Beauty Riches Honour Toys  Not worth a Moment's Care  Hence painted Dust and gilded Clay  You have no Charms for Me  Delusive Breath be far away  I waste no Thought on thee  II  But when abroad at once I view  Both the World's Hosts and Thine  These simple sad afflicted few  These num'rous gay and fine  Lost my Resolves my Scorn is past  I boast my Strength no more  A willing Slave they bind me fast  With unresisted Pow'r  III  O brook not this let not thy Foes  Profane thy hallow'd Shrine  Thine is my Soul by sacred Vows  Of strictest Union Thine  Hear then my just tho' late Request  Once more the Captive free  Renew thy Image in my Breast  And claim my Heart for Thee  The COLLAR From the same  I  NO more I cry'd shall Grief be mine  I will throw off the Load  No longer weep and sigh and pine  To find an Absent GOD  II  Free as the Muse my Wishes move  Thro' Nature's Wilds they roam  Loose as the Wind ye Wand'rers rove  And bring me Pleasure home  III  Still shall I urge with endless Toil  Yet not obtain my Suit  Still shall I plant th' ungrateful Soil  Yet never taste the Fruit  IV  Not so my Heartfor Fruit there is  Seize it with eager Haste  Riot in Joys dissolve in Bliss  And pamper ev'ry Taste  V  On Right and Wrong thy Thoughts no more  In cold Dispute employ  Forsake thy Cell the Bounds pass o'er  And give a Loose to Joy  VI  Conscience and Reason's Pow'r deride  Let stronger Nature draw  Self be thy End and Sense thy Guide  And Appetite thy Law  VII  Away ye Shades while light I rise  I tread you all beneath  Grasp the dear Hours my Youth supplies  Nor idly dream of Death  VIII  Whoe'er enslav'd to Grief and Pain  Yet starts from Pleasure's Road  Still let him weep and still complain  And sink beneath his Load  IX  But as I rav'd and grew more wild  And fierce at ev'ry Word  Methought I heard One calling "Child"  And I reply'd"My Lord"  GRACE From the same  I  MY Stock lies dead and no Increase  Does thy Past Gifts improve  O let thy Graces without cease  Drop gently from above  II  If still the Sun should hide his Face  Earth would a Dungeon prove  Thy Works Night's Captives O let Grace  Drop gently from above  III  The Dew unsought each Morning falls  Less bounteous is thy Dove  The Dew for which my Spirit calls  Drop gently from above  IV  Death is still digging like a Mole  My Grave where'er I move  Let Grace work too and on my Soul  Drop gently from above  V  Sin is still spreading o'er my Heart  A Hardness void of Love  Let suppling Grace to cross her Art  Drop gently from above  VI  O come for Thou dost know the Way  Or if Thou wilt not move  Translate me where I need not say  Drop gently from above  GRATEFULNESS From the same  I  THOU who hast giv'n so much to me  O give a grateful Heart  See how thy Beggar works on Thee  By acceptable Art  II  He makes thy Gifts occasion more  And says if here he's crost  All Thou hast giv'n him heretofore  Thyself and All is lost  III  But Thou didst reckon when at first  Our Wants thy Aid did crave  What it would come to at the worst  Such needy Worms to save  IV  Perpetual Knockings at thy Door  Tears sullying all thy Rooms  Gift upon Gift much would have more  And still thy Suppliant comes  V  Yet thy unweary'd Love went on  Allow'd us all our Noise  Nay Thou hast dignify'd a Groan  And made a Sigh thy Joys  VI  Wherefore I cry and cry again  Nor canst Thou quiet be  Till my repeated Suit obtain  A Thankful Heart from Thee  VII  Hear then and Thankfulness impart  Continual as thy Grace  O add to all thy Gifts a Heart  Whose Pulse may be thy Praise  The METHOD From the same  I  LAment unhappy Heart lament  Since GOD refuses still  To hear thy Pray'r some Discontent  Unknown must cool his Will  II  Doubtless thy heav'nly Father could  Give All thy Suit does move  For He is Pow'r And sure He would  Give All for He is Love  III  Go then the secret Cause explore  Go search thy inmost Soul  Let Earth divide thy Care no more  Since Heav'n requires the Whole  IV  Ha What do I here written see  It tells me "Yesterday  Cold I prefer'd my careless Plea  And only seem'd to Pray"  V  But stayWhat read I written there  "Something I would have done  His Spirit mov'd me to forbear  Yet boldly I went on"  VI  Then bend once more thy Knees and pray  Once more lift up thy Voice  Seek Pardon first and GOD will say  "Again Glad Heart rejoice"  Grieve not the HOLY SPIRIT From the same  I  AND art thou griev'd O Sacred Dove  When I despise or cross thy Love  Griev'd for a Worm when ev'ry Tread  Crushes and leaves the Reptile dead  II  Then Mirth be ever banish'd hence  Since Thou art pain'd by my Offence  I sin not to my Grief alone  The Comforter within doth groan  III  Then weep my Eyes for GOD doth grieve  Weep foolish Heart and weeping live  Tears for the Living Mourner plead  But ne'er avail the hopeless Dead  IV  Lord I adjudge myself to Grief  To endless Tears without Relief  Yet O t' exact thy Due forbear  And spare a feeble Creature spare  V  Still if I wail not still to wail  Nature denies and Flesh would fail  Lord pardonfor thy Son makes good  My Want of Tears with Store of Blood  The SIGH From the same  I  MY Heart did heave and there came forth "O GOD"  By that I knew that Thou wast in the Grief  Making a Golden Sceptre of thy Rod  To guide and govern it to my Relief  Hadst Thou not had a more than equal Part  Sure the unruly Sigh had broke my Heart  II  But since thy Will my Bounds of Life assign'd  Thou know'st my Frame and if a single Sigh  Ask so much Breath what then remains behind  Why if some Years of Life together fly  The swiftlywafting Sigh then only is  A Gale to bring me sooner to my Bliss  III  Thy Life on Earth was Grief to this Thou still  Art constant while thy suff'ring Majesty  Touch'd with my Mis'ry feels whate'er I feel  Adopts my Woes and daily grieves in me  Thy Death was but begun on  Calvary    Thou ev'ry Hour dost in thy Members die  The FLOWER From the same  I  WHILE sad my Heart and blasted mourns  How chearing Lord and thy Returns  How sweet the Life the Joys they bring  Grief in thy Presence melts away  Refresh'd I hail the gladsome Day  As Flow'rs salute the rising Spring  II  Who would have thought my wither'd Heart  Again should feel thy sov'reign Art  A kindly Warmth again should know  Late like the Flow'r whose drooping Head  Sinks down and seeks its native Bed  To see the MotherRoot below  III  These are thy Wonders Lord of Pow'r  Killing and Quick'ning One short Hour  Lifts up to Heav'n and sinks to Hell  Thy Will supreme disposes All  We prove thy Justice in our Fall  Thy Mercy in our Rise we feel  IV  O that my Latest Change were o'er  O were I plac'd where Sin no more  With its Attendant Grief could come  Stranger to Change I then should rise  Amidst the Plants of Paradise  And flourish in Eternal Bloom  V  Many a Spring since here I grew  I seem'd my Verdure to renew  And higher still to rise and higher  Water'd by Tears and fan'd by Sighs  I pour'd my Fragrance thro' the Skies  And heav'nward ever seem'd t' aspire  VI  But while I grow as Heav'n were mine  Thine Anger comes and I decline  Faded my Bloom my Glory lost  Who can the deadly Cold sustain  Or stand beneath the chilling Pain  When blasted by thine Anger's Frost  VII  And now in Age I bud again  Once more I feel the Vernal Rain  Tho' dead so oft I live and write  Sure I but dream It cannot be  That I my GOD that I am He  On whom thy Tempests fell all Night  VIII  These are thy Wonders Lord of Love  Thy Mercy thus delights to prove  We are but Flow'rs that bloom and die  Soon as This saving Truth we see  Within thy Garden plac'd by Thee  Time we survive and Death defy  DESERTION From the same  I  JOY of my Soul when Thou art gone  And I which cannot be Alone  It cannot Lord for I on Thee  Depend and Thou abid'st in me  II  But when Thou dost the Sense repress  Th' extatic Influence of thy Grace  Seem to desert thy lov'd Abode  And leave me sunk beneath my Load  III  O what a Damp and deadly Shade  What Horrors then my Soul invade  Less ghastly low'rs the gloomiest Night  Than the Eclipse that veils thy Light  IV  O do not do not thus withdraw  Lest Sin surprize me void of Awe  And when Thou dost but shine less clear  Say boldly That Thou art not here  V  Thou Lord and only Thou canst tell  How dead the Life which then I feel  Pursu'd by Sin's insulting Boast  That "I may seekbut Thou art lost"  VI  I half believe the deadly Cold  Does all my Pow'rs so fast infold  That Sin says true But while I grieve  Again I see thy Face and Live  A TRUE HYMN From the same  I  MY Joy my Life my Crown of Bliss  My Heart was musing all the Day  Fain would it speak yet only this  "My Joy my Life my Crown" could say  II  Few as they are and void of Art  Yet slight not Lord these humble Words  Fine is that Hymn which speaks the Heart  The Heart that to the Lines accords  III  He who requires his Creature's Time  And all his Soul and Strength and Mind  Complains if Heartless flows the Rhyme  What makes the Hymn is still behind  IV  The scanty Verse Himself supplies  Let but the fervent Heart be mov'd  And when it says with longing Sighs  "O could I love" GOD writeth "Lov'd"  The TEMPER From the same  I  O Lord how gladly would my Rhymes  Engrave thy Love in Steel  If what my Soul doth feel sometimes  My Soul might ever feel  II  Tho' there were forty Heav'ns or more  Sometimes I mount them all  Sometimes I hardly reach a Score  Sometimes to Hell I fall  III  Rack me not to such vast Extent  These Lengths belong to Thee  The World's too little for thy Tent  A Grave too big for me  IV  O mete not Arms with Man nor stretch  A Worm from Heav'n to Hell  Strive not with Dust nor let a Wretch  Thy Pow'r Almighty feel  V  Yet take thy Way thy Way is best  Grant or deny me Ease  This is but tuning of my Breast  To make the Musick please  VI  Rise I to Heav'n or sink to Dust  In both thy Hands appear  Thy Pow'r and Love my Love and Trust  Make One Place Ev'ry where I  The same  I  IT cannot be Is this the Heart  That swelled so late with mighty Joy  Lord if Thou needs must use thy Dart  Spare thy own Gifts and Sin destroy  II  The Greater World knows no Decay  But thy Diviner World of Grace  A new Creator ev'ry Day  Thou suddenly dost rear or rase  III  Set up thy Kingdom in my Heart  That all my Pow'rs thy Sway may own  For ah my Lord if Thou depart  Strait rebel Nature mounts thy Throne  IV  Tho' Heav'n be mov'd may I remain  Stedfast and centred firm on Thee  Here six thy Court and still maintain  A standing Majesty in me  BITTERSWEET From the same  I  AH my dear angry Lord  Since Thou dost love yet strike  Cast down and yet thy Help afford  Sure I will do the like  II  I will complain yet praise  Bewail and yet approve  And all my mournful joyful Days  I will lament and love  A HYMN for MIDNIGHT  I  WHILE Midnight Shades the Earth o'erspread  And veil the Bosom of the Deep  Nature reclines her weary Head  And Care respires and Sorrows sleep  My Soul still aims at Nobler Rest  Aspiring to her Saviour's Breast  II  Aid me ye hov'ring Spirits near  Angels and Ministers of Grace  Who ever while you guard us here  Behold your Heav'nly Father's Face  Gently my raptur'd Soul convey  To Regions of Eternal Day  III  Fain would I leave this Earth below  Of Pain and Sin the dark Abode  Where shadowy Joy or solid Woe  Allures or tears me from my GOD  Doubtful and Insecure of Bliss  Since Death alone confirms me His  IV  Till then to Sorrow born I sigh  And gasp and languish after Home  Upward I send my streaming Eye  Expecting till the Bridegroom come  Come quickly Lord Thy own receive  Now let me see thy Face and live  V  Absent from Thee my exil'd Soul  Deep in a Fleshly Dungeon groans  Around me Clouds of Darkness roll  And lab'ring Silence speaks my Moans  Come quickly Lord Thy Face display  And look my Midnight into Day  VI  Error and Sin and Death are o'er  If Thou reverse the Creature's Doom  Sad  Rachel  weeps her Loss no more  If Thou the GOD the Saviour come  Of Thee possest in Thee we prove  The Light the Life the Heav'n of Love  After considering some of his Friends  I  WHY do the Deeds of happier Men  Into a Mind return  Which can opprest by Bands of Sloth  With no such Ardors burn  II  GOD of my Life and all my Pow'rs  The Everlasting Friend  Shall Life so favour'd in its Dawn  Be fruitless in its End  III  To Thee O Lord my tender Years  A trembling Duty paid  With Glimpses of the mighty GOD  Delighted and afraid  IV  From Parents' Eye and Paths of Men  Thy Touch I ran to meet  It swell'd the Hymn and seal'd the Pray'r  'Twas calm and strange and sweet  V  Oft when beneath the Work of Sin  Trembling and dark I stood  And felt the Edge of eager Thought  And felt the kindling Blood  VI  Thy Dew came downmy Heart was Thine  It knew nor Doubt nor Strife  Cool now and peaceful as the Grave  And strong to Second Life  VII  Full of Myself I oft forsook  The Now the Truth and Thee  For sanguine Hope or sensual Gust  Or earthborn Sophistry  VIII  The Folly thriv'd and came in Sight  Too gross for Life to bear  I smote the Breast for Man too base  I smoteand GOD was there  IX  Still will I hope for Voice and Strength  To glorify thy Name  Tho' I must die to all that's Mine  And suffer All my Shame  RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE  TO speak for GOD to sound Religion's Praise  Of sacred Passions the wise Warmth to raise  T' infuse the Contrite wish to Conquest nigh  And point the Steps mysterious as they lie  To seize the Wretch in full Career of Lust  And sooth the silent Sorrows of the Just  Who would not bless for This the Gift of Speech  And in the Tongue's Beneficence be rich  But who must talk Not the mere modern Sage  Who suits the soften'd Gospel to the Age  Who ne'er to raise degen'rate Practice strives  But brings the Precept down to Christian's Lives  Not He who Maxims from cold Reading took  And never saw Himself but thro' a Book  Not He who Hasty in the Morn of Grace  Soon sinks extinguish'd as a Comet's Blaze  Not He who strains in Scripturephrase t' abound  Deaf to the Sense who stuns us with the Sound  But He who Silence loves and never dealt  In the false Commerce of a Truth Unfelt  Guilty you speak if subtle from within  Blows on your Words the Selfadmiring Sin  If unresolv'd to choose the Better Part  Your forward Tongue belies your languid Heart  But then speak safely when your peaceful Mind  Above Selfseeking blest on GOD reclin'd  Feels Him at once suggest unlabour'd Sense  And ope a Sluce of sweet Benevolence  Some high Behasts of Heav'n you then fulfil  Sprung from his Light your Words and issuing by his Will  Nor yet expect so  Mystically  long  Till Certain Inspiration loose your Tongue  Express the Precept runs "Do good to all"  Nor adds "Whene'er you find an inward Call"  'Tis GOD commands no farther Motive seek  Speak or without or with Reluctance speak  To Love's Habitual Sense by Acts aspire  And kindle till you catch the GospelFire  Discoveries immature of Truth decline

Redeeming Love    Tis done my Justice asks no more  The Satisfaction's fully made  Their Sins He in his Body bore  Their Surety all the Debt has paid  My Righteous Servant and my Son  Shall each Believing Sinner clear  And All who stoop t'abjure their own  Shall in His Righteousness appear    Them shall He claim His just Desert  Them His Inheritance receive  And many a contrite humble Heart  Will I for his Possession give  Satan He thence shall chase away  Assert his Right his Foes o'ercome  Stronger than Hell retrieve the Prey  And bear the Spoil triumphant Home    For charg'd with all their Guilt he stood  Sinners from Suffering to redeem  For Them He pour'd out all his Blood  Their Substitute He died for Them  He died and rose his Death to plead  To testify Their Sins forgiven

LXIII Chapter of ISAIAH Altered from Mr  Norris    I  NO common Vision this I see  In more than human Majesty  Who is this mighty Hero who  With glorious Terror on his Brow  His deep dy'd Crimson Robes outvie  The Blushes of the Morning Sky  Lo how triumphant he appears  And Vict'ry in his Visage bears  II  How strong how stately does he go  Pompous and solemn is his Pace  And full of Majesty his Face  Who is this mighty Hero who  'Tis I who to my Promise stand  I who sin Death Hell and the Grave  Have foil'd with this allconquering Hand  'Tis I the LORD mighty to save  III  Why wear'st Thou then this Crimson Dye  Say Thou allconquering Hero why  Why do thy Garments look all red  Like them that in the Wine fat tread  The Winepress I alone have trod  That pond'rous Mass I ply'd alone  And with me to assist was none  A Task worthy the Son of GOD  IV  Angels stood trembling at the Sight  Inrag'd I put forth all my Might  And down the Engine prest the Force  Put frighted Nature out of Course  The Blood gush'd out and checquer'd o'er  My Garments with its deepest Gore  With glorious Stains bedeck'd I stood  And writ my Victory in Blood  V  The Day the signal Day is come  Vengeance of all my Foes to take  The Day when Death shall have its Doom  And the dark Kingdom's Pow'rs shall shake  I look'd who to assist stood by  Trembled Heav'n's Hosts nor ventur'd nigh  Ev'n to my Father

Great are the Things which Thou has done  How holy is thy Name O LORD  How wondrous is thy Mercy shewn  To all that tremble at thy Word  IV  Thy conqu'ring Arm with Terror crown'd  Appear'd the Humble

With Majesty and Glory crown'd  VI  The Rich have pin'd amidst their Store  Nor e'er the Way of Peace have trod  Mean while the hungry Souls thy Pow'r  Fill'd with the Fulness of their GOD  VII  Come

omnipresent Sight  Ev'n to the pathless Realms extends  Of uncreated Night  II  Plung'd in th' Abyss of deep Distress  To Him we rais'd our Cry  His Mercy bad our Sorrows cease  And fill'd our Tongue with Joy  III  Tho' Earth her ancient Seat forsake  By Pangs convulsive torn  Tho' her selfbalanc'd Fabrick shake  And ruin'd Nature mourn  IV  Tho' Hills be in the Ocean lost  With all their trembling Load  No Fear shall e'er disturb the Just  Or shake his Trust in GOD  V  Nations remote and Realms unknown  In vain resist his Sway  For lo  Jehovah  's Voice is shewn  And Earth shall melt away  VI  Let War's devouring Surges rise  And swell on ev'ry Side  The Lord of Hosts our Safeguard is  And  Jacob  's GOD our Guide  PSALM CXIII  I  YEPriests of GOD whose happy Days  Are spent in your Creator's Praise  Still more and more his Fame express  Ye pious Worshippers proclaim  With Shouts of Joy his holy Name  Nor satisfy'd with praising bless  II  Let GOD's high Praises still resound  Beyond old Time's too scanty Bound  And thro' eternal Ages pierce  From where the Sun first gilds the Streams  To where he sets with purpled Beams  Thro' all the widestretch'd Universe  III  The various Tribes of Earth obey  Thy awful and imperial Sway  Nor Earth thy Sov'reign Pow'r confines  Above the Sun's allchearing Light  Above the Stars and far more bright  Thy pure essential Glory shines  IV  What Mortal form'd of fading Clay  What Native of eternal Day  Can with the GOD of Heav'n compare  Yet Angels round thy glorious Throne  Thou stoop'st to view Nor They alone  Ev'n earthborn Men thy Goodness share  V  The Poor Thou liftest from the Dust  The Sinner if in Thee he trust  From Depths of Guilt and Shame Thou'lt raise  That he in Peace and Safety plac'd  With Pow'r and Love and Wisdom grac'd  May sing aloud his Saviour's Praise  PSALM CXVI  I  O Thou who when I did complain  Didst all my Griefs remove  O Saviour do not now disdain  My humble Praise and Love  II  Since Thou a pitying Ear didst give  And hear me when I pray'd  I'll call upon Thee while I live  And never doubt thy Aid  III  Pale Death with all his ghastly Train  My Soul encompast round  Anguish and Sin and Dread and Pain  On ev'ry Side I found  IV  To Thee O LORD of Life I pray'd  And did for Succour flee  O save in my Distress I said  The Soul that trusts in Thee  V  How good Thou art How large thy Grace  How easy to forgive  The helpless Thou delight'st to raise  And by thy Love I live  VI  Then O my Soul be never more  With anxious Thoughts distrest  GOD's bounteous Love doth Thee restore  To Ease and Joy and Rest  VII  My Eyes no longer drown'd in Tears  My Feet from falling free  Redeem'd from Death and guilty Fears  O Lord I'll live to Thee  PSALM CXVII  I  YE Nations who the Globe divide  Ye num'rous Nations scatter'd wide  To GOD your grateful Voices raise  To all his boundless Mercy's shown  His Truth to endless Ages known  Require our endless Love and Praise  II
