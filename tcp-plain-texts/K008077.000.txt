which is annexed A POEM on PROVIDENCE  Both written by  STEPHEN DUCK  Thresher and Husbandman of the County of  Wilts  LONDON  Printed and Sold by W HARRIS at the  Blue Ball  next Door to the  Rose  Tavern without  TempleBar  and by the Booksellers and Pamphletsellers of  London  and  Westminster  MDCCXXX Price Sixpence  ON  ROYAL BENEVOLENCE  Most humbly Inscribed to Her MAJESTY Queen  CAROLINE  _MOST bounteous QUEEN my grateful Thanks I pay  Which scarcely for the Dress of Words will stay  Your ROYAL MAJESTY a Muckworm took  From Labour pleas'd with his mean trifling Book  And now the Reptile at your Footstool lays  In humble Strains to sing your worthy Praise  The Wits prophane may court  Urania  's Aid  And make Addresses to a fictious Shade  But I need no such Phantoms to inspire  Your Royal Bounty sets my Soul on fire  And what I lov'd before I now admire  As on our Parents Labour was intail'd  I work'd and fallen State of Man bewail'd  I pray'd for Ease from Sorrow Want and Pain  And labour'd my poor Offspring to maintain  Without ambitious Thoughts or Wishes vain  I found my Ease in only Rest from Pain  And bless'd the Giver when I thrash'd the Grain  YET Want sometimes would stare me in the Face  And scarce my Labour wou'd supply my Race  WHEN Heav'n in pity to my poor Estate  Brought me in Favour with the Wise and Great  And heaping Bounty upon Bounty more  Rais'd me to Plenty from a Threshingfloor  Your Royal Goodness o're my Cottage shone  With brighter Beams than did the rising Sun  And from a Barn Companion to the Mice  Plac'd me at Ease and in a Paradice  Under great Heaven my QUEEN I must adore  Whose bounteous Soul no Captive needs implore  Like  Phoebus  in his Glory all She sees  And blesses all in various Degrees  May Heav'n preserve all who surround her Throne  And may her Line ne'er want a ROYAL SON  Now as I've leisure Fancy to display  My Pen shall ever grateful Homage pay  For sure no Wretch can e're so stupid prove  As to be blind to such abundant Love  What am IWhat I wasFrom whence I came  Are Thoughts can't leave me long without a Theme  WHEN e're I view the Grain in Barn or Field  Or see a Farm that does GOD's Blessing veild  The Prospect will such Contemplation raise  As must begin in Joy and end in Praise  No Meadow green or Stack or Cock of Hay  But where I view will furnish an Essay  And then the Objects of my Praise will be  The mighty Lord and her great Majesty  Our GOD the Author of Benevolence  Who does by second Causes Gifts dispense  In Goodness as in Greatness infinite  His Children to good Actions does excite  HE saw her Majesty made up of Love  And often heard her Orrisons above  To know his Will and knowing it to do  His Work is all She aims at here below  Th'Almighty seeing so much Christian Grace  And how on Earth she ran the heavenly Race  Has constituted ROYAL  CAROLINE  His Agent here to make his Glory shine  The Noble Great and Powerful humbly kneel  Submissive full of Loyalty and Zeal  And ask but to obey to all Commands  Sign'd by such just and mutal Royal Hands  The poor anticipated have no more  Than but to have it barely known they're Poor  Nay some have strove their Poverty to hide  Through Shame or what should shame remaining Pride  But such our Royal QUEEN in secret found  And brought them out of Mire to blessed Ground  And this contriving and performing Good  Runs in each Vein of HANOVERIAN Blood  On  PROVIDENCE  COULD Mortals taste of heavenly Bliss and Joy  The Rapture would the human Frame destroy  Our little Minds tost with perpetual Cares  Are lost when Grief or Joy comes unawares  Excess shakes Nature but Vicissitude  In Moderation is an Interlude  When right apply'd to all our humane Good  I who have labour'd in a Threshingfloor  Was once contented in my State tho' poor  Yet like all Mortals still I pray'd for Ease  But labour'd still like the industrious Bees  Knowing the Winter comes when Food is dear  And Nature wants Supplies of wholesome Cheer  Justly to think is Happiness on Earth  And cheerful Thoughts at Labour is sound Mirth  I who have labour'd for a trifling Sum  Was pleas'd to think the time of Pay was come  One Shilling goes for this and one for that  And still the Flail went patt and patt apatt  The Wife would say How can you be content  I know not how to pay your Quarter's Rent  I bid her look on Birds in Bushes there  And see the little silly Insect here  Behold the Order of the Universe  And ask the Hen and Chickens for a Purse  She talk'd like Woman guided by a Will  Who nothing knew of real Good or Ill  But when she had the Course of Things survey'd  She own'd what all must own Heaven sends its Aid  To all its Creatures Reason and Instinct join  And both with Care compleat our GOD's Design  A virtuous Man may various Troubles find  But still the greatest Trouble's in the Mind  The Death of Friends affects usPoor we pine  But could we see our Maker's great Design  There's some good End and something that's Divine  FINIS
