 AN EXCURSION TO THE LAKES In Westmoreland and Cumberland AUGUST  LONDON  Printed for J WILKIE No in St Paul's Churchyard and W GOLDSMITH No Paternosterrow  MDCCLXXIV  AN EXCURSION c  WHEN ever I have read the descrip∣tions given by travellers of foreign countries in which their beauties and antiquities were lavishly praised I have always regretted a neglect which has long attended the delightful scences at home The monuments of antiquity dispersed over this island are many and various  some of them arose in the remotest ages and point out to us the revolutions and history of our own kingdom a degree of knowledge which ought to stand first in importance with every Englishman  These sentiments gave rise to a sum∣mer's excursion the pleasures of which I have endeavoured to communicate to the reader in the following pages  The first requisites for a pleasure jaunt are companions of suitable taste and cu∣riosity and conveniences for the journey they encrease every enjoyment and make every scene which presents itself more agreeablethese were not wanting  Thus circumstanced we were conduc∣ted to BOWES in Yorkshire to which place I shall first attempt engaging the attention of the reader  BOWES is of great antiquity in which is all its meritThe country around it is meanly cultivated its habitations are melancholy and what alone claims the attention of a traveller is the ruin of a castle supposed by some to have been of Roman construction but by others to be the Turris de Arcubus built by Allan first Earl of Richmond in the Conque∣ror's time It is situated on the old Ro∣man way which leads from Cathrick or the antient Cateractonium  This castle is fiftythree feet high is built of hewn stone of excellent work∣manship forming a square of equal sides of eightyone feet each the windows are irregular and the walls which are ce∣mented with lime mixed with small flints are near five feet in thicknessIt is now much defaced the outward casing having  been stripped off in many places within it appears to have been divided into seve∣ral apartments one of the lower divisions of which was supported by a central pil∣lar from whence a roof of arches has arisen the groins still projecting from the walls  This castle is situated on the brink of a hill declining swiftly to the southward at whose foot runs the river GretaIt is surrounded with a deep ditch on the south side of which is a plain or platform apparently calculated for the use of the castleOn the eastern point of this plat∣form we were shewn the scite and remains of a bath with its aqueduct which are now totally in ruins and grown over with weeds and brambles  On a late inclosure of some common lands belonging to Bowes an antient  aqueduct was discovered which had con∣veyed the water from a place called Le∣var or Levy Pool near two miles distant from the castle which was sufficient at once to supply the garrison with fresh water and also the baths  A few scanty meadows border the river Greta and cultivation seems to awake in ignorance over the adjoining lands where the plough share begins to make the traces of industry on the skirts of the desert  Camden who wrote in the latter part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth and of the th century speaking of this place says  Bowes which also is written Bowgh was then a little village where in preceding ages the Earls of Richmond had a pretty castelet the customs of thorough toll and their furcas which was the power of executing criminals In old times it was called in Antonin  s Itinirarie Levatrae Lavatrae the distance and scite thereof by the Highstreet which is here evidently apparent do prove it but what  greatly confirms the antiquity of it is an antient large stone in the church used by the Romans for an altar with the following inscription upon it to the honour of Hadrian the Emperor  IMP CAESARI DIVI TRAIANI PARTHICI maxfilio  DIVI NERVAE NEPOTI TRAIANO Hadria  NO AUG PONT MAXIM  Cos IPPCOH IIII F  IO SEV  This fragment was also there dug up      NOL CAE  FRONTINUS  COH I THRAC  Whilst Virius Lupus ruled as Lieutenant General and  Propraetor of Britain under Severus the Emperor the first cohort of the Thracians laid here in garrison for whose use he rebuilt and restored the bath or hot∣as appears by the following inscription which was removed from hence to Cunnington the house of Sir Robert Cotton  DAE FOR TUNE  VIRIUS LUPUS  LEG AUG PR PR  BALINEUM VI  IGNIS EXUST  UM COH I THRAC  UM REST  ITUIT CURANTE  VAL FRON  TONE PRAEF  EQ ALAE VETTO  Here I must correct their error who by falsely copy∣ing this inscription read Balingium for Balineum and thence form an opinion that the name of the place was Balingium but upon a close attention to the engra∣ving  it is evidently Balineum which word the learned know was used for Balneum In the declining state of the Roman empire a band of the exploratores with their captain kept their station here under the com∣mand of the General of Britain as appears out of the Notice of Provinces where it is called Lavatres But as such baths as th  se were also called in latin Lavacra some critic will pronounce that this place was named Lavacra but I would rather presume it took its name from a little river running near to it which I have heard is called LavarAs for the later name of Bowes considering the old town had been burnt to the ground as all the inhabitants report I should think it arose upon that occasion for that which is burnt in the old British language is called boeth    An other occasion besides what is men∣tioned by Camden may have given the modern name of Bowes as this place was granted by William the Conqueror to one of his attendant adventurers  The antient monuments said by Cam∣den to be in the church of Bowes are  not now to be discovered neither are there any other antiquities there which can af∣ford any light to the history of the place  We have the authority of an antient M▪S belonging to the dissolved monastry of St Mary's in York for the name arising from the following occasion  Allanus niger Comes Richmondie unus fundatorum hujus  monasterii Iste Allanus niger frater Ducis Britanie intravit Angliam in Exercitu Willimi Conquestoris cui dictus Willimus contulit pro servicio suo Domi∣num Comitatum Richmond et postea idem Allanus primus Com Richmondie in defensionem tenentium suorum Comitatus predict contra expugnationes homi∣num de Westmoreland et Cumberland rebellantium contra dictum Conquestorum ac cum Gospatrico Duce Northumbrie adherentium Regi Scotarum edificavit sibi Turrim do Arcubus in quo constituit Guillamum consanguineum suum praefectum super Sagittarios et dedit ei scutum proprium cum armis Britanie et tres arcus desuper et unum bundellum Sagittarum pro capitali insigne suo ipse Guillarmus exinde nun∣cupatus fuit Guillarmus de Arcubus    From Bowes proceeding towards West∣moreland we were respited from the sad scene of barrenness to which we were obliged to pass by some infant inclo∣sures and attempts towards cultivation the climate the dreary vicinage of  mountains and the inclement skies seem to deny industry her natural rewards  At length Spittle presents its solitary edifice to the view behind which Stain∣more arises whose heights receive the burthen of both eastern and western stormsAs we advanced a dreary pro∣spect was extended to the eye the hills are cloathed in heath and all around is a scene of barrenness and deformity the lower grounds are rent with torrents which descend impetuously from the steeps in winter and chasms which are har∣rowed on the sides of the hills yawn with ragged rocks or black and rotten earth Here and there some scattered plots of grass variegate the prospect where a few sheep find pasturage and now and then a little rill is seen in the deep dell which as it flows with disconsolate meandrings is tinged with the sable soil through  which it passesNo habitation for man∣kind appears on either side but all is wil∣derness and horrid waste over which the wearied eye travels with anxiety  Camden says  Here begins to rise that high hilly and solitary country exposed to wind and rain which because it is stoney is called in our native language Stanemore all around is nothing but a wild desert unless it is an humble hostelrie rather than an inn in the midst of it called Spittle on Stanemore to en∣tertain travellers    At the door of the turnpike house on Stainmore stands a cylindrical stone which seems to have been a Roman guide post but the inscription is so obliterated that it cannot now be made out When we approached Roy Cross mentioned by Camden  Near to it is a fragment of a cross which we call Rere Cross the Scots Roy Cross or King's Cross  which cross Hector Boetius the Scottish writer recordeth to have been erected as a m  e  stone to bound England and Scotland at the time that William the Conqueror granted C  mberland unto the Scots on condition that they should hold it of him as his tenants and not at∣tempt any thing which should be prejudicial to the Crown of England  which is now the boundary  stone dividing Yorkshire from Westmore∣land we perceived it stood within the remains of a large entrenchment de∣fended by banks of earth ten paces wide through which the present turnpike road now passes Its form is an oblong square extending from north to south with two openings on every side of the square im∣mediately opposite to each other defended by a mound of earth placed right in the front of each pass now rising from the plane about five perpendicular feet which is near the height of the entrenchment in its highest part  The eastern side is two hundred and seventy paces in length the openings on the sides are ten paces wide the moles which defend the same are thirtysix paces in circumference and stand ten paces from the outward edge of the entrench∣ment The ascent of the adjoining ground on this side is gradual for near half a mile  The northern end is two hundred and fortynine paces in length with two openings therein defended by moles of earth similar to those on the eastern quar∣ter and as the ground here is flat for a considerable distance so this part of the entrenchment was by nature rendered in∣accessible from the north by a deep mo∣rass  The western side is similar to those before described being two hundred and seventyeight paces in length standing on a swift descent which falls without in∣termission for half a mile or upwards  The southern end is in length one hundred and eightyone paces has its openings and moles as before described but stands on the brink of a precipice of considerable heightOn the highest ground within the entrenchment is a large mound of earth of a square figure arising from the plane near three perpendicular feet and in circumference fiftythree paces  We have no account of this entrench∣ment in history and are left to conjecture to what people it might belongAs it lies on the Roman road it strikes one with an apprehension that it was of  Roman original but the singularity of the passes and mounds which guard them do not correspond with their usual mode of fortifying a camp though the interior mound may be well esteemed the praetorium From the conflicts between the northern English and the Normans after the conquest and preceding Wil∣liam's ceding Cumberland to the Scots this place may be conceived to have been a camp of one of those powers  As we travelled from hence for seve∣ral miles all around was one continued scene of melancholythe hills encrea∣sing in height the valleys deepning and growing more desolatethe wind sounded amongst the rocks whilst a hea∣vy vapour in some parts clouded their summits in others driving rain was seen streaming along the dells and shrowding their gloomy recesses The wearied  mind of the Traveller endeavours to evade these objects and please itself with the fancied images of verdant plains of streams and happy groves to which we were approachingWhilst we were thus engaged unexpectedly the scene opened and from such a horrid wild gave us a prospect as delightful as the other was disgusting  Over a rugged and rocky foreground we looked upon STAINMOREDALE in front her verdant meadows cheared the eye her sweet sequestered cottages her grassy plains and little shades of syca∣mores seemed enchanting as their beau∣ties were enhanced by the deformity from which they had escaped On the right hand a mountain arises emersing its grey head and naked brow in clouds the sides are barren rocks in whose chinks here and there a few shrubs are seen  clinging and cast a teint of green to va∣riegate the stormbleached precipice On a wild and forlorn situation in an opening on the side of a mountain HELL∣BECK HALL is discovered covered with trees the place seems calculated for dis∣content and hidden from all that is chearful in the world is befitted to a mind of disappointment and despair all its prospect is barrenness the voice of water falls of breezes mourning in the branches of the copse or hissing on the fissures of the rock its music dayexcluding sha∣dows make it gloomy and overhanging vapours damp and dreary  Yet Hellbeck has its beautiesit contrasts with the vale beneath where the far outstretching plain reaches to the very bounds of Cumberland whose lofty mountains were seen from our then sta∣tion tinged with blue vapours and  mixing their summits with the skyIn the fore ground lays BROUGH whose an∣tient castle formerly the seat of Pem∣brokes affords a noble object around which rich meadows drest in the brightest green and fresh verdure after mowing plots of ripening corn sparkling sheets of water seen through the trees which deck their margins the windings of each brook little groves of ash and sycamore fantastically dispersed and intermixed with villages and cots form the beauties of the vale on this hand extending to∣wards Kirbv Steven on that to Dufton and in front as far as Penrith Beacon  As we begun to descend the hill to∣wards Brough and leave Stainmore's de∣sert we passed near an antient Roman fortification called MAIDEN CASTLE The Roman road has led immediately through it it forms a square and has  been built of stoneeach side of this square is forty paces in length and is defended by outworks the nearest being a small ditch with a breastwork of large stones set erect and the outward one a ditch and mound of earthThis place has been of great strength in former times from its natural situation com∣manding the pass from Broughthe as∣cent on the side opposite to Brough is very steep for upwards of a mile to the south it is inaccessible by reason of the precipice on whose brink it stands and towards the north the ground is every where rugged and mountainous  Camden writes that a little lower upon the Romans high street there stood a little fort of the Romans built four square which at this day they call Maiden Castle from whence as the borderers reported the way went with many windings in and out as far as Caer Vorrau in Northumberland    The night was spent at BroughFa∣tigue gives a relish beyond what the sons of ease can possibly experience in the midst of their luxury Beds of down are only conscious of anxiety and weariness to restless ambition and greatness The peasant breathing health from his la∣bours sleeps emparadised on his bed of contentment and chaff  BROUGH is now divided into two small mean towns the one called Church Brough the other Market Brough sepa∣rated by a little brook which falls into the River EdenHusbandry is very little advanced here the management of grass land is the farmer's whole excellence the meadows being kept in good order and very wealthyThe inhabitants are ig∣norant of men and manners but subtle and crafty  On parties of pleasure time should ne∣ver be limitedto ride post through a country is too much the custom of tra∣vellers by which they can reap no more than a general idea of itThe specula∣lative traveller is never confined to roads times or seasons but as the circum∣stances exciting his curiosity lay either to the right or left he pursues the objects of his attention without regard to hours or rules  The pleasantness of the morning called us very early from Broughthe dawn advanced with a deep calmthe clouds broke from the hills and drew their grey veil from the face of morning revealing her in blushesall the valley lay wrapped in stillnesscare and industry had not departed from their night's recessesthe ear was hushed and all around seemed to  be the region of tranquilityere it was long various sounds grew on the sense and the living landscape gave us new pleasures where the busy cottagers were all abroad in the several occupations of the field  As we pursued our journey at an open∣ing of the road to the left we viewed the ruins of BROUGH CASTLE In former times this was a formidable fortress and said to be of Roman construction The building to the eastern side is semicircu∣lar and seems to be of modern architec∣ture but to the west there remains a noble tower apparently of great antiqui∣ty and built in the form and stile of other Roman edifices in the north of Eng∣land The whole castle stands on a very considerable eminence arising swiftly from the plain and by its outworks shews it to have been a place of great strength  In the beginning of the last century it was repaired by the Countess of Pem∣broke who made it her residence This appeared by an  This inscription was in all respects similar to one put up on a like occasion by the Countess of Pembroke on Skipton Castle which runs as follows  This Skip∣ton Castle was repaired by the Lady Anne Clifford Countess Dowager of Penbroke Dorse Montgome∣ry Baroness Clifford Westmoreland and Vesey Lady of the Honor of Skipton in Craven High Sheriffess by inheritance of the county of Westmoreland in the years after the main part of it had lain ruinous ever since December and the January following when it was then pull'd down and demo∣lished almost to the ground by the command of the Parliament then sitting at Westminster because it had been a garrison in the then civil wars in England Isaiah cha ver God's name be praised  inscription that lately stood over the south entrance which also described that it had suffered by fire and laid in ruins above a century preceding  The stone which contained this inscrip∣tion some few years ago fell down and was destroyed  As the Sun advanced he gave various beauties to the scenethe beams stream∣ing through the divisions in the moun∣tains shewed us their due perspective and striped the plain with goldthe light falling behind the castle presented all its parts perfectly to usthrough the broken windows distant objects were dis∣coveredthe front ground laid in sha∣dows  Camden describing this country says  Here Eden doth as it were make stay with his stream to give meeting unto other petty rivers upon one of which scarce two miles from Eden itself stood Verterae a town of antient memorie mentioned by Antonine the Emperor and the book of Notices in which it is said that in the declining age of the Roman Empire  a Roman captain with a band of the Directores were stationed there but now the town is decayed and become a small poor village defended by a little for∣tress and the name turned into Burgh for it is com∣monly called Burgh under Stanmore For in the late Emperor's time little castles suited to warfare and furnished with stores of corn began to be called Burgs I have read nothing singular of that Burg but that in the beginning of the Norman government the northern English conspired here against William the Conqueror that this Burg was Verterae I dare venture to affirm because its distance from Lavatrae on the one side and from Brovonacam on the other being reduced into Italian miles exactly agrees with Antonine's numbers and further by reason of the Ro∣man highstreet as yet apparent by its ridges lead this way to Brovonacum by Aballaba  On the left the prospect was shut  in by a range of craggy mountains on whose steeps shrubs and trees were scat∣teredto the right a fertile plain was ex∣tended surmounted by distant hills over their summits the retiring vapours as they fled the valley dragged their watery skirts and gave a solemn gloom to that  part of the scene Behind the building the lofty promontary of Wilbore Fell lifted its brow tinged with an azure hue and terminated the view  Half mankind know nothing of the beauties of nature and waste in indolence and sleep the glorious scene which ad∣vancing morning presentsas we past on the varied prospect kept attention exerted  At the distance of a mile from Brough the village of WARKUP to the left af∣fords an agreeable viewWarkup Hall shrowded with a rich wood of sycamores overtops the village the verdure of the meadows with some extensive fields of yellow corn contrasted by the hills of pasture grounds which lay on the southern side brown with the summer heat and tufted with brushwood gave a pleasing  variety whilst the morning beam break∣ing aslant upon the valley and glistening on the brook with the blue teints of smoke that arose from the hamlets painted the rural sceneWe were fur∣nished with ideas which still rendered the prospect more pleasing as they reminded us of the social spirit of the owner of Warkup in whose life hospitality and benevolence are truly characterised  The valley now growing more exten∣sive encreased its varieties and pleased us with a new scene of advancing culti∣vation and husbandry The large tracts of ground which we past along were lately common but are now dividing and forming into inclosures  At the sixth milestone we stopped to admire the singularity of the view to the right where a range of mountains arising  from the extensive plain over which we were travelling stretched to the westward and afforded a romantic and noble scene the nearest hills with rocky brows and barren cliffs raised their grey fronts a∣bove the brushwood which girted them in the midst whilst their feet in hasty slopes descended into the vale in pastu∣rage further retiring from the eye the mountain called Cross Fell with a front of naked stones overtops all the adjoining hills being said to exceed the mountain of Skiddow one hundred and ten perpen∣dicular feet in heightFurther extending westward the chain of mountains lay in perspective till they died away upon the sight and in azure hue seemed to mix with the sky whilst at the foot of this vast range of hills three smaller mounts of an exact conic form running parallel beautified the scene being covered with verdure to their crowns The nearest  called Dufton Pike was shadowed by a passing cloud save only the summit of its cone which was touched by a beam that pointed it with goldthe second pike was all enlightened and gave its verdure to the prospect as if mantled with velvetthe third laid shadowed whilst all the range of hills behind were struck with the sunshine shewing their cliffs their caverns and their dells in strange and grotesque variety and giving the three pikes a picturesque projection on the landscapeas if nature delighted to charm the eye of man she at this time cast an accidental beauty over the scene The small clouds which chequered the sky as they passed along spread their flitting shadows on the distant mountains and seemed to marble them a beauty which I do not recollect has struck any painter and which has not been de∣scribed even by the bold hand of the im∣mortal  Pousin The most exquisite fancy of a painter could not have devized a more pleasing variety of light and sha∣dow than what was cast upon this pro∣spect  APPLEBY to which we now approach∣ed though placed on a very elevated situa∣tion was concealed from our view till we arrived within half a mile when from the hill which we had ascended it gave us an agreeable surprize On the brink of a lofty eminence fronting towards the east at whose foot runs the river Eden the Castle presented itself The steep on whose brow this noble edifice is erect∣ed is richly cloathed with wood save only where a rugged cliff of a red hue breaks through the trees and gives an agreeable variety to the landscapethe front of the castle which presented itself is irregular and antique but loses great  share of its beauty by the joints of the building being whitened and bedaubed with lime Over this front the top of a fine square tower is discovered whose cor∣ners arise in turrets The landscape to the left is richly woodedto the right it is divided by hanging gardens which adjoin to the town overtopped with the dwellings The pavillions belonging to the house of John Robinson  Esq  with the parterres and sloping plots of grass ground modernize a scene which con∣demns all factitiousness of taste and by the simplicity and elegance nature pre∣sents to us on the adjoining lands re∣proves the distortions which she receives from dull right lines and anglesbut whilst I censure fashion I revere the owner of the mansion whose excellencies are too eminent to want the traveller's applause  As we approached the bridge and cast our eyes up the valley we were delighted with the happy assemblage of woods and meadows which form the little vale where the Eden flows Through the thronging branches the water was seen in many places reflecting a tremulous beam and sparkling in the sun's raysover the val∣ley red cliffs and rocks on this hand ap∣pear projecting through the trees on that is seen the lofty front of the castle  The prospect from the terrace which is under the eastern front of the castle is very beautifulto the right the river Eden forms a winding lake▪ for the dis∣tance of half a mile whose banks are cloathed with lofty hanging woods de∣scending in a swift but regular sweep to the brink of the stream Below us the water murmured over a wear where a  mill added to the pleasing sounds On the left red cliffs and precipices arise per∣pendicular from the water over whose brows oaks and ashes hanging render their aspect more romantic by the solemn shadeOn the ground above the public road leading to Appleby winds up the hill on whose sides some cottages are scattered whilst all behind mountains form the distant ground shadowed with clouds  Camden writes that Aballaba of which mention is made in the book of Notices hath hitherto kept the antient name so well that it proveth itself beyond a doubt for we call it short Appleby instead of Abal∣laba It is memorable for its antiquity and situation In the Roman's time the Aurelian Maures kept a station there Its scite is pleasant as it stands almost encom∣passed by the river Eden but it is so slenderly inhabited and the buildings are so simple that were it not for its antiquity from whence it deserved to be accounted the  chief town of the shire and to have sessions and assize kept in the castle which is the common goal for male∣factors it would be little better than a village All its beauty lies in one broad street which from north to south riseth with an easy ascent of the hill    Whilst we stayed here enjoying this sweet scene I could not forbear pointing out to my companion a little tenement which stood opposite to us near to the brink of the river where the fairest maid resides that graces Eden's banksstately and tall she seems the lilly of Eden's gar∣den whilst she is fair and meek as lillies too in her countenance beauty is graced with intelligence and in her behaviour innocence is mixed with politeness  The garden grounds around Appleby castle are without ornament and are cal∣culated for use only On the western side  detached from the rest of the edifice is a very lofty square tower which the peo∣ple call Caesar's tower and which from its form appears to be Romanthe cor∣ners form a projection of near a foot from the plane of each front and rise above the rest of the building in square turrets now covered with lead the remaining part of the top being embrasuredthere are two small windows on each front near the middle of the building parallel to each other This tower is defended by an outward wall forming a kind of cres∣cent at the distance of about twelve paces now remaining near twenty feet in height strongly sustained on the outside by bu∣trasses erected on an eminence thirty paces in ascent and defended by a deep ditch withoutThe quarter fronting to the castle lies open to the area which is inclosed by a wall continuing from the points of the crescent  The great hall is worthy the observa∣tion of travellers there being enclosed in a case in the wainscot a fine piece of por∣trait painting of the Pembroke family ornamented with their pedigree and his∣torical notes of their lives and atchieve∣mentsA stranger is from thence con∣ducted through an adjoining room where the ragged remains of embroidered fur∣niture give you a most deplorable idea of decaying magnificence and the vanity of pride when the doors of a closet being suddenly thrown open you are startled from your reverie by the shaking of ar∣mour and the sight of a compleat suit trembling in every jointthis armour is preserved with great attention as having been worn by the last Earl of Westmore∣land who has been a man of very small staturethe arms are richly embossed and inlaid with gold  In its Ichnography this castle is not much unlike to the ruins of Brough the towers being detached from the main edi∣fice and placed to the west  APPLEBY CASTLE is one of the seats of the Earl of Thanet but of late years has been much neglected by the family Lord Thanet is hereditary Sheriff of the county of Westmoreland and is entitled to many noble privileges there some of which in this age of liberty and cultiva∣tion are rather oppressive his free chace in particular  The great possessions of the Countess of Pembroke in this country came into the Thanet family in the following man∣nerJohn Earl of Thanet succeeded his mother Margaret Countess of Thanet as Baron of Clifford Westmoreland and  Vesey in the year and in the year he also succeeded his cousin the La∣dy Aliathea sole daughter and heir of James Earl of Northampton by his first wife the Lady Isabella his mother's sister Whereby he became possest of the whole inheritance of his grandmother the Coun∣tess of Pembroke  Colling's Peerage    The town of Appleby chiefly consists of one wide continued street hanging upon the swift decline of a hill in a direction north and south the castle terminating it on the summit the church at the foot The situation is delightful in the sum∣mer season but in the winter very cold the natural disadvantages of its scite be∣ing encreased by the great searcity of coal to supply which want wood and peats are chiefly used as fuelThe meadows  and pasture grounds are beautiful but there is little tillage it having been a re∣ceived opinion for ages past that grain would not ripen or come to perfection so near the moors and mountains from whence a continued moist vapour is borne into the valley which blights the corn in its blossom or prevents it filling or maturing But this absurdity is declin∣ing through experience which hath taught the inhabitants that the want of knowledge in agriculture was all the de∣fect  This is a very antient Borough and by prescription sends two members to par∣liamentIt is the county town but is not blest with a situation for tradethe markets are not populous the country adjoining by reason of its extensive wastes and uncultivated lands being thinly inhabitedThis is a corporation  town and is governed by a mayor al∣dermen and common councilThe late conflicts in political matters have enriched the inhabitants the contested election for this Borough having bestowed upon the burgage owners many thousands of pounds  The place where the judges of Assize sit in judgment on criminals is very an∣tique and remarkableby the arms placed on one of the corner pillars it ap∣pears to have been erected by the Pem∣broke familyit is situate in the market∣place fronting to the north is opened on the sides by a rude balustrade and in the front is supported by pillars so that it may be truly said the Judge sits dispen∣sing justice in the forum  The buildings in this place are chiefly antient some few modern houses of red  free stone which have a remarkable fine effect are interspersed Near the summit of the hill stands an obelisk a pillar of the Ionick order arising on some few steps on the base of which is cut this remarkable inscription  Preserve your liberties maintain your rights  It seems to be placed there as a public sa∣tire on the conduct of the burgage owners and to say hither and no fur∣ther the conflagration of public virtue advancedAs it had its origin in the contested elections it excites a smile of derision on the countenance of the travel∣ler to whose mind it renews the odious ideas of the corruptions of this ageIn the midst of the town to the disgrace of the corporation stands a filthy slaughterhouse and shambles  There is a school amply endowed be∣longing  to this place  In the upper part of this place says Camden standeth the castle aloft almost wholly environed by the Eden At the foot of the town stands the church near to which is a school founded by Robert Langton and Miles Spen∣cer Doctors of Laws Reginald Bainbrig is the present master a learned man who governs the same with great applauseIt was not for nothing that William of New∣borough called this town and burgh princely holds where he writes that William King of Scots surprized them a little before the time he was himself taken priso∣ner at A  nwick which King John afterwards having re∣covered gave to Robert Vipoint in consideration of his singular services to him and the state  Before the door of the schoolhouse some Roman altars are placed amongst these antiquities one Reginald Bainbrig has given a memorial of his folly to posterity by some inscrip∣tions in antique characters to celebrate his own memory in which at least his Latin inelegance "qui docuit hic" might have been spared  The road which we pursued from Ap∣pleby for several miles gave us great pleasure The valleys through which the river Eden runs are singularly beautiful their woody banks and level meads af∣forded a variety of landscapes particularly below Crackenthorp  We passed by Kirby Thore where no remains of ancient Roman grandeur spo∣ken of by Camden are now to be found Acorn Bank the seat of William Nor∣ton  Esq  and Temple Sowerby laid also in our way of which we were told no∣thing memorable but that there remained to this day a pecuniary mulct paid to the Lord of the Manor in lieu of his cus∣tom with each bride within his jurisdic∣tionIt is an extraparochial place and from its ancient owners the Knights  Templars enjoyed many privileges which are now obsolete  We passed WHINFIELD PARK an extensive forest the property of the Earl of Thanet where we had the pleasure of viewing a large tract of ground lately enclosed from the park growing corn Nothing can give greater satisfaction to the eye of the traveller than to behold cultivation and industry stretching their paces over the heath and waste the forest and the chacepopulation must follow and riches ensueIn Whinfield the re∣mains of an ancient oak of prodigious size is shewn to strangers called Three Brother tree a name arising from the concealment of three brethren within its cavityOn the way side a shattered trunk of an oak called White Hart tree is seen a cotemporary perhaps of the other though inferior in sizethe mo∣nument  of elapsed centuries and the ef∣figy of old age stretching forth its wi∣thered limbs on one side and on the o∣ther a scanty foliage and poor remnant of life This tree is nine yards and two feet in circumference  A STONE PILLAR erected by the side of the road next attracted our attention near to which was placed a stone table The stalk of the pillar is sexagon the top of it square on the sides of this square are represented in several quarterings the arms of the Pembrokes a south dial and the following inscription  This Pillar was erected Anno Domini by the Right Honble Ann Coun∣tess Dowager of Pembroke c Daugh∣ter and sole Heiress of the Right Honble George Earl of Cumberland for a me∣morial of her last parting in this place  with her good and pious mother the Right Honble Mary Countess Dowager of Cumberland the d of April in memory whereof she also left an an∣nuity of l to be distributed to the poor of the parish of Brougham every d day of April for ever upon the stone table here hard by Laus Deo  We quitted the high road in order to pass by BROUGHAM CASTLE a spacious ruin situate on the banks of the river YeomanThat we might enjoy the pros∣pect to advantage we crossed over the river and made a sweep round the mill which stands almost opposite to Brougham from thence the view opened upon us de∣lightfully  The mill with its streams lay on the fore ground to the lefta beautiful and shining canal formed by the river Yeo∣man  margined with shrubs laid spread∣ing to the rightin front the streams which fell over the wear made a foaming cascade immediately on the opposite brink of the channel arises BROUGHAM CASTLEthree square towers projecting but yet connected with the building form the frontfrom thence on either side a little wing falls back some paces to the north east a thick grove of planes and ashes blocks up the passage and the gate∣wayto the south west the walls stretch out to a considerable distance along a sine grassy plain of pasture ground terminated by a tower one of the outposts of the castlein the centre of the building a∣rises a lofty square tower frowning in Gothick strength and gloomy pomp The shattered turrets which had formed the angles and the hanging gallery which had communicated with each were grown with shrubs and waving  bramblesThe sun beams which struck each gasping loup and bending window discovered the inward devastation and ruin and touched the whole with admi∣rable colouring and beauty to grace the landscape fine groups of cattle were dis∣persed on the pasture and through the tufts of ash trees which were irregularly dispersed on the back ground distant mountains were seen skirting the horizon  The lower apartment in the principal tower is still remaining entire being covered with a vaulted roof of stone consisting of eight arches which as they spring from the side walls are supported and terminate on a pillar in the centre The apartment mentioned to have been in Bowes Castle was assuredly of the same architecture as appears from the remains of the groins still projecting from  the walls there together with part of the elevation of the centric pillar  Camden says  the Roman way goeth straight into the west by Whinfield a large Park shaded by trees hard by Brovoniacum standing twenty Italian miles or seventeen English miles from Verterae as Anto∣nine notes it who hath also called it Brocovum the Book of Notices stiles it Broconiacum which expresses that a company or band of Defensores were stationed here Time hath consumed the beauty and buildings of this town yet the name remains almost uncorrupted for it is called at this day Brougham    Having now entered the county of of Cumberland and passing on behind CARLTON the seat of James Wallace  Esq  the eye wandered with delight over a fine cultivated country from whence we had a distant view of the rich valley of Lowther decked with noble and extensive woodsAs we approached to PENRITH the mountains and piles of  rocks which stand on Hull'swater af∣forded an august sceneand at the ter∣mination of the road the ruins of Penrith Castle presented themselvesThe genius the virtue and industry of the owner of these rich lands which we were then passing arose to our thoughtsthe be∣nevolent mind must ever be touched with pleasure when the meritorious man is re∣warded in this world for his excellence  PENRITH is an agreeable town situate on the easy decline of a hill to the south∣wardit is unchartered being governed by the Steward of the Honor and a Jury A confiderable manufactory of cotton and linen checks is carried forward here The houses in general are well built and the inhabitants are facetious and po∣liteThe name of this place is derived from the colour of the hills near it Pen∣roeth being in the ancient British language  a Red HillHere we met with the ut∣most civility every one we addrest shew∣ing themselves ready to give us all the information in their power of what was curious in the country  Our first excursion from Penrith was to mount the steep hill on which the beacon is placed upwards of a mile to the north∣ward of the townthe labour was great by which we ascended this mount but the view from thence amply rewarded our fatigueThe beacon house is a square building of stone and is happily situated for the purpose of alarming the country in times of public danger as it com∣mands a very extensive vale  The northern window of the beacon kouse affords a prospect of Cross Fell with the Pikes of Dufton together with a chain of mountains extending from east  to west near thirty miles which on the western point sink in the spacious plain where the city of Carlisle lies The utmost bounds of this view are formed by a ridge of Scotch mountainsSome faint ap∣pearance of St Mary's church marks to the eye the scite of Carlisle  The eastern window presented to us a view of the country we had passed bounded by the hills of Stainmore and the lofty promontary of Wilborefell above Kirby Stephen with its neighbouring mountains  The south window returned to us the view of Brougham Castle with its plains of pasture groundThe spreading woods of Lowther intermixed with rich culti∣vated lands form the rising grounds Some parts of the lake of Hull'swater are seen whilst the mighty rocks and moun∣tains  which hemn in the lake lift up their heads in rude confusion and crown the scene  The western window affords a new and not less pleasing prospectthe town of Penrith lay before us and here and there the river Yeoman shewed its wind∣ings through its woodsThe hill which rises above the town is crowned with the awful remains of a royal fortresstime has despoiled its grandeur but its Honors still survive to its noble owner the Duke of Portland who therewith holds the Ho∣nor of Penrith formerly a royal franchise Beyond these objects amongst a range of mountains at the distance of eighteen miles Skiddow is seen with his majes∣tic front surmounting all the high lands that terminate the view  The whole prospect from the beacon  hill as you turn every way presents you with a vast theatre upwards of one hun∣dred miles in circumference circled with stupendous mountains  Common justice requires that in what∣ever station of life merit is discovered it should receive a degree of praise propor∣tioned to its excellenceFrom this uni∣versal principle which benevolence de∣lights to cherish I must not pass in silence the deserts of our Penrith hostThe common conduct of publicans prepossesses the mind of the traveller when he enters an inn with the unfavourable idea that your host is an unfeeling extortioner im∣pertinent curious and imposingwho∣ever shall visit Penrith either on business or pleasure will find the keeper of the White Swan the very reversea man above his rank in sentiments above his fellows in propriety of manners his  house commodious and clean his provi∣sions excellent and his attendance prompt and not impertinent  Our second excursion from Penrith was by LOWTHER to the LAKE of HULL'sWATER we passed the village of Clif∣ton memorable for the skirmish on the th day of December between the Duke of Cumberland's forces and the rebelsOn the approach to Clifton from Lowther the way which the Duke's forces advanced lies Clifton moor a spacious common descending with an easy slope towards the villageon the western side of this moor the road is situate within twenty yards of the inclosures which are fenced by hedges and stone walls from whence the rebels begun firing on the Duke's horse and made some slaughter to the east the land descends to some swamps with small inclosures at the foot  of which is a narrow dark lane passable for no more than one horseman at a time Near this place General Honeywood re∣ceived those marks of savage barbarity which had nearly cost him his lifeA little detached from the village stands a cottage where the rebel Captain Hamil∣ton with some others had concealed themselves This being discovered one of the Duke's Hussars with great dexte∣rity attacked the house and riding round it fired several shot in at the window which did some execution and obliged Hamilton to shew himself when there began a single combat between two e∣qually expert in horsemanship and the use of arms in which Hamilton was taken prisoner after giving and receiving many wounds  A train of melancholy sentiments flowed in upon the mind on passing the  ground rendered famous to posterity by battles and slaughterwhen rebellion adds its horrid die to darken the retro∣spection the soul recoils at the sad and unnatural scene and tears start from the eye to weep the sins of fell ambition and the pride of man  We visited the present works of Sir James Lowther to which he is pleased to give the name of The Village the build∣ings of which are of stone handsomely sashed and covered with blue slate Our approach was at the eastern end where the work there proceeding formed a crescent behind which the other build∣ings are thrown in squaresThe design on which the proprietor is building this beautiful place is to entertain a number of linen manufacturers the erections be∣ing calculated for that purpose with pro∣per apartments for the directors and go∣vernors  of such a workBy the ap∣pearance of the place it seems as if it would be capable of receiving a thousand artistsThe utility and greatness of this project are too manifest to require the traveller's animadversions enough it is to say that such works under the aus∣piecs of such men give the observer in∣finite pleasure The distances between the rich and poor in this luxurious and proud age have been too distinctly main∣tainedThe wealth and felicity of this nation depends upon the intimate con∣nection between property and trade Where opulence is diffused in works to bless the industrious poor in projects to promote manufactory and arts panegy∣ric is silenced by that inward approbation and esteem which leads the mind to re∣gard such virtue in the character of the rich man with reverence  We pass'd along from this agreea∣ble scene to a place called the College from its having been formerly the residence of the preceptors of the Lowther Family where our admiration was enlarged by the princely works there carried on at the sole expence of Sir James We obtained admission to inspect the carpet manufac∣tory which is there conducted in the manner of the GoblinesIt is not possible to convey any competent idea of the beauty of this work by de∣scriptionthe shag thrown up on the face of the carpeting is about half an inch in thickness which renders it so du∣rable that a new erected mansion would not outstand such furniture The colours are disposed with the utmost taste and judgment in representation of natural flowers as delicate easy and just as the works of the pencilWe were so for∣tunate  as to see in the looms some carpets of peculiar beauty the one was wrought on a coppercoloured ground scattered with sprigs of flowers the other was on a vio∣let groundthe roses and convolvulus the jesmines and carnations were exqui∣sitethey looked like fresh pulled flowers thrown upon velvet their disposition was in the happiest taste and the colours were given to form the most agreeable changes and varietyThe master of this work in an open and polite manner conducted us not omitting one circumstance which he apprehended could add to our pleasure in the inspectionThe spinning for this work is done by children from the found∣ling HospitalTears of pleasure gushed upon the eye to behold these poor or∣phans who would otherwise perhaps have been totally lost to the world and to themselves thus by so excellent a chari∣ty saved from the hands of destruction  and vice rendered useful members of so∣ciety and happy in their industry and innocence  The carpet manufactory is carried on solely for Sir James's pleasure and not for sale we were informed that some little time ago a piece of this work was presented to her Majesty  Passing from the college we desended the banks of the river Lowther whose woody scenes are every where picturesque and pleasing  In this path  How long soe'er the wanderer roves each step  Shall wake fresh beauties each short point present  A different picture new and yet the same  Mason's Garden    The beauties of the prospect at  Askam Bridge engaged our attention the water descending over a rockey chan∣nel fell in irregular and foaming streams the little plain above was dressed in the brightest green the lofty banks on every hand were cloathed with stately oaks save only where a bold promontary which overhung the road where we had passed shewed its rocky brow from out the shade which crowned its threatning front  A gentleman who was so obliging as accompany us in this day's excursion conducted our rout with great judgment from Lowther he caused us to ascend the hills which bordered upon Hulls'water so that the Lake was totally con∣cealed from us in our approach till we were just upon it  Having attained the summit with  no small degree of patience and fatigue it opened suddenly upon our view pre∣senting to us a sheet of water of the form of an  S  nine miles in extent and greatly above a mile in widthas we looked upon it from a great eminence we could discern all its bays its shores and promontaries and in the extensive landscape take in a vast variety of objects thrown together with all that beauty which wood and water lawns rising sweeps of corn villas vil∣lages and cots surmounted by immense mountains and rude cliffs can form to the eyethe country to the right for many miles was variegated in the finest man∣ner by enclosures woods and villas amongst which Graystock Dacre and Delmain were seen whilst to the left nothing but stupendous mountains and rude projecting rocks presented themselves to the sight vying with each other for grandeur and eminence  We descended to the village of POOLEY and from thence by a winding road on the margin of the Lake passed on for near a mile to a small inn where we left our horses  We were accommodated on the water with one of the barges belonging to the Duke of Portland which have been sent there by his Grace for pleasuringa strong south breeze rendered the Lake so rough that the surf broke over the bow whilst the swell gave us motion almost equal to that felt at seamy companion suffered no small mortification by this accident at it incommoded him much in drawing views of this admirable scene We were obliged to coast it up the Lake to keep as much under the wind as possible the labour being very great to  make any way with four boatmen at the oars  As we took the boat there stood to our right a mountain almost perfectly circular covered with verdure to the crown arising swiftly from the edge of the water many hundred feet in height and shadowing us from the sunto the left the Lake spread out its agitated bosom whitened with innumerable brea∣kers much above a mile in breadth whose opposite shore in one part ascended gradually with cultivated lands from the village of Pooley skirting the hills over which some scattered wood was happily disposed in irregular groves and winding lines whilst all above the brown heath reached the summitsThis land adjoined to a mountain much superior in height to that upon our right rising almost per∣pendicular from the Lake with naked  cliffs on its rugged side through the grey rocks was torn a passage for a ri∣vulet whose waters fell precipitate with a mighty noise into the deep belowthe ground more distant which was seen still upwards over an expanse of water not less than four miles consisted of lofty rocks and bold promontaries here and there shewing naked and stormbleached cliffs and in other places scattered over with the spring of young oaks arising from the stoves of trees which the ax had lately slainWe could not forbear la∣menting the loss of so great an ornament to this romantic scene as a forest of timber trees hanging on these declivities must have been from this and every other point of view on the Lake  As we passed along having doubled two small capes we fell into a bay under the seat of John Robinson  Esq  of  WATER MELLOCKFrom the very margin of the Lake in this part the grass ground ascended gradually in an easy slope where were dispersed in an agreeable irregularity pretty groves of ash there  Many a glade is found  The haunt of wood gods only where if art  E'er dar'd to tread 'twas with unsandal'd feet  Printless as if the place was holy ground  Mason's Garden  Above which the easy inclining hills shewed us yellow fields of corn over∣topped by the white front of a venerable mansion more noted for its hospitality than for the elegance of its structure  The pleasantness of this bay the ver∣dure of the newmown meads with the shade of the grove induced us to take our noontide repast there  Whilst we sat to regale the barge put off from shore to a station where the finest echoes were to be obtained from the surrounding mountainsThe vessel was provided with six brass cannon mounted on swivelson the discharge of one of these pieces the report was echoed from the opposite rocks where by reverberation it seemed to roll from cliff to cliff and return through every cave and valley till the decreasing tumult gradually died away upon the ear  The instant it had ceased the sound of every distant waterfall was heard but for an instant only for the momentary stillness was interrupted by returning echo on the hills behind us where the report was repeated like a peal of thunder burst∣ing over our heads continuing for seve∣ral seconds flying from haunt to haunt  till once more the sound gradually decli∣nedagain the voice of waterfalls pos∣sessed the intervaltill to the right the more distant thunder arose upon some other mountain and seemed to take its way up every winding dell and creek sometimes behind on this side or on that in wondrous speed running its dreadful coursewhen the echo reached the mountains within the line and channel of the breeze it was heard at once on the right hand and left at the extremi∣ties of the LakeIn this manner was the report of every discharge reechoed seven times distinctly  At intervals we were relieved from this entertainment which consisted of a kind of wondrous tumult and grandeur of confusion by the music of two French horns whose harmony was repeated from every recess which echo haunted on the  borders of the Lakehere the breathings of the organ were imitated there the bas∣soon with clarinetsin this place from the harsher sounding cliffs the cornet in that from the wooded creek amongst the caverns and the trilling water falls you seemed to hear the sosttoned lute ac∣companied with the languishing strains of enamoured nymphs whilst in the copse and grove was still retained the music of the hornsAll this vast theatre seemed to be possessed by innumerable aerial beings who breathed coelestial har∣mony  As we finished our repast from a general discharge of the guns we were roused to new astonishment for altho' we had heard with great surprize the for∣mer echoes this exceeded them so much that it seemed incredible for on every  hand the sounds were reverberated and returned from side to side so as to give us the semblance of that confusion and horrid uproar which the falling of these stupendous rocks would occasion if by some internal combustion they were rent to pieces and hurled into the Lake  During the time of our repast the wind was hushed and the Lake which on our first entrance was troubled and foaming now became like a shining mirror reflect∣ing reversed mountains and rocks groves meads and valesthe water was so transparent that we could perceive the fish and pebbles at the depth of six or eight fathomwe now doubled a woody promontary and passing by the foot of Gobery Park ascended into the narrow part of the Lake leaving the grassy mar∣gins and the scattered copse which had bordered the water as we past by Wa∣ter  Mellock now all around us being one scene of mountains which hemmed us in arising with awful and precipitate frontshere the white cliffs raised their pointed heads there the shaken and rifted rocks were split and cavated into vast shelves chasms and dreary cells which yawned upon the shadowed Lake whilst other steeps less rugged were decked with shrubs which grew on every plain and chink their summits being embrowned with sunparched moss and herbage  The scene was nobly awful as we approached to STARBURY CRAGat every winding of our passage new hills and rocks were seen to overlook those which had but the minute before been new upon our prospect the clouds hung heavily upon the mountains rolling in gloomy volumes over their heads in  some places dragging their ragged skirts along the sides of the steeps giving them a deep and melancholy shade in others admitting the sun beams which illumi∣nated the winding dells with a greyish light  We saw within some little distance of the shore a sulphurine springWe were sorry to find this valuable gift of nature remained unanalized and neglected by the neighbouring gentlemen it ap∣peared to be much of the nature of Har∣rowgate Spaw and is said to have shewn excellent medicinal qualities to those who have used it  The fishermen belonging to Mr Ro∣binson were so obliging as to make us two draughts but we were not fortunate enough to take any very large fish we drew trout perch and skelley  which last is a kind of freshwater her∣ring all of which were of excellent fla∣vourThey sometimes take a trout pe∣culiar to this water of thirty pounds weight and upwards and eels of eight or nine pounds  After a voyage of upwards nine miles we returned passing down the cen∣tre of the Lake We had again arrived opposite to the woody promontary which joins to the extreme of the cultivated lands of Water Mellock when the view down the Lake opened upon us  The meadows the groves the moun∣tains and the rocks which environed the Lake were disposed in the most picturesque order bending around the margin of an expanse of water of five miles overthe lands of Water Mel∣lock now layed at a distance to the left  surmounted by some small conic hills the heights of Gobery Park that ranged westward and terminated by the grassy mountain at whose foot we passed upon ourentranceThese sweetly intermingled groves corn fields and meads gently inclining to the Lake where they sunk on the grassy margin or stretched into easy promontaries now lay in the hap∣piest arrangementto the right were the rocky steeps down which the foam∣ing cataract was hurried from whence the upstretching inclosures upon gradual declinations formed the more distant hills above which from hanging groves that overlooked each other some blue rocks crowned with brown heath ap∣pearedat the extreme of this sine cres∣cent stood mount DUNMORLET of a most beautiful conic form covered from its skirts to the crown with oaks ashes and firs fortunately mingled at whose  foot the single arch of Pooley bridge the outlet of all this mighty Lake appeared bending over a little valley where some few cottages were scattered over which at the extremity of the dale Penrith bea∣con formed a pleasing obelisqueThe beauties of this scene were encreased by the reflection given in the water where the deep green hue was seen to mix with the olive and the grey of the adjoining objects whilst the back ground seemed to decline in faintest purple variegated with the deep crimson streaks of an even∣ing sky  We hung upon our oars some time reluctant to quit this prospect and enjoy∣ing the music of the hornsthe exqui∣site softness and harmony which the echoes produced here were not to be de∣scribedthe music seemed to issue from some resounding temple which stood  concealed behind the mountains where the most solemn and delicate symphony was heard as if reverberated from the brazen dome or marble colonades and as the breeze at intervals grew softer one might imagine the voices of a thou∣sand choiristers had filled the lengthened chorus  It happened fortunately for us that the sun some short time before setting shone out serenewe made a little turn to look back upon the dark and rocky scene which we had passed when the vapour which had for some time almost covered the mountains with a gloomy veil appeared to roll up upon the breeze like a mighty curtain and withdrew opening gradually to the eye the pompous theatreNo sooner were these cumbrous volumes lifted above the summits of the western hills than the horizontal rays  broke in upon the mountains the grass on these heights which had been parched and turned of a russet hue received the light in a delicate manner becoming a rich shade to the bright gold teints with which the sun beams passing through the evening vapour struck the cliffs as the slantway rays pierced each valley and interstice of the mountains here beam∣ing over a whole hill there tinging the tops of rocks and catching the edges of the precipice with the lustre of burnished gold whilst the deep shades of every vale each dell chasm and cave height∣ened the colouring aboveIn the water we traced all this picturesque scene in∣verted the long and deep shadows thrown from the mountains over the Lake made the objects which were thus illumined be most beautifully reflected on this mir∣ror of sable  Here the mind was touched with pious and reverential thoughts which alone delight in silence whilst contem∣plation dwells on the mighty author of such wondrous works to whom it is ac∣ceptable that the heart of man seeking him in such scenes as these should pay that adoration which no language can express  Approaching night rouzed us from our rhapsodies the clouds above our heads were deeply tinged with crimson and the whole Lake as we proceeded on our voyage seemed to glow with a fine carnationas the sun still descended the vapours which hung with a grey hue over the hills now assumed a flame co∣lour and seemed to wind up a multitude of glowing streams in the most grotesque figures whilst all below was sinking  from the eye into a solemn confusion the whole range of mountains appearing as if on fire the images of Ovid imme∣diately occurred to my memory  Caucasus ardet  Ossaque cum Pindo majorq ambobus Olimpus  Aeriae{que} Alpes nubifer Apenninus  We regained the little inn at the foot of Dunmorlet where our horses waited for us and returned towards Penrith de∣lighted with our voyage in our conversa∣tion enumerating the wonderous and enchanting scenes to which we had been present till we reached DELMAIN the seat of J Hazell  Esq  the rich woods which are spread around this mansion together with its handsome stonebuilt front gave us expectation whilst we saw it in the morning at a distance that it would be still more pleasing on a nearer view but we could not forbear turning our eyes away in disappoint∣ment  when we perceived the approach and court kept no better than a stable∣yard  A little ramble took place in the en∣suing morningin our way we were shewn the tenement in which by the great tempest some few years ago Miss Bolton and her female friend were over∣whelmed in the ruins of their house over whose untimely monument even piety lets fall a tear and resignation bows to heaven with sights whilst hope in holy whispers tells that innocence and virtue called from hence become an∣gelic  We viewed the ruins of PENRITH CASTLEit is said to have arose on the foundations of a Roman fortress the traces of which are not now to be dis∣coveredThe buildings form a square  and are situate on a rising ground sur∣rounded with a ditchThe scite to∣wards the town is much more elevated than on any of the other quartersthis front consists of the remains of an angu∣lar tower to the East which now stands separated from the rest by the falling of the walls the centre which projects a little from the plane of the front is hast∣ening to decay presenting to the eye broken chambers passages and stairs this part of the building is still con∣nected with the western angular tower an open hanging gallery forming the communicationbelow this gallery a large opening is made by the falling of the building forming a rude arch through which and the broken walls to the east the interior parts of the ruin are perceived in a picturesque mannerNo∣thing remains within but part of a stone∣arched vault which by its similitude to  places of the like nature which we had formerly seen we conceived to have been the prison  From thence we went to view a place by the inhabitants called ARTHUR's ROUND TABLE near to Yeoman bridge and within about half a mile from Pen∣rithThis is said to be of great anti∣quity but there is no tradition when by whom or for what purpose it was made  Camden writing of Penrith says  Not far from the confluence of Eimot and Lowther where is seen that round trench of earth which the country people term Arthur's round Table standeth Penrith which is if you interpret it out of the British language the Read Head or Hill for the soil and stones there are of a reddish colour but commonly cailed Perith a little town of no great trade fortified on the west side with a castle of the Kings which in the reign of  King Henry the Sixth was repaired out of the ruins of a Roman fort near to it called Mayburgh The town is graced with a large church the market∣place is spacious with a markethouse of timber or∣namented by bears at a ragged staff which was the device of the Earls of WarwickIn former times it belonged to the Bishops of Durham but when Bishop Anthony Beck grew haughty with his too great riches King Edward the First as we find in Durham book took from him Penrith with other places For the use of this town William Strickland Bishop of Carlisle at his own cost caused an aqueduct to be made out of PeterrillNear to which was Plumpton  Park a large tract of ground which the Kings of England in old times used as a forest for wild beasts but King Henry the Eighth disparked it and wisely appointed it for the habitations of men as being in the marches near where the kingdoms of England and Scotland adjoined Just by this place I saw many remains of a decayed town which from its vicinity is called Old Penrith I for my part would judge it to be Petreanie  It is said of the order of Knights of the Round Table that it was instituted by King Arthur to the end there might be no question about precedency and to teach heroic minds not to be ambitious of place but merit    It is cut in a little plain near to the river of an exact circular figure save to the eastern and western sides an approach is left on the common level of the plain the trench which is cast up and by which it is formed is near ten paces wide the soil which has been thrown up on the outward side forms a kind of theatre  the approaches are ten paces wide and the whole circle within the ditch is one hundred and sixty paces in circumference We were induced to believe this was an ancient tilting ground where in days of chivalry tournaments had been held the approaches would answer for the ca∣reer and the circle seems sufficient for the champions to shew their dexterity in justing and horsemanship the whole cir∣cus  being capable of receiving one thou∣sand spectators without the ditchIt doth not appear probable that this hath been an intrenchment or fortified camp it being too small for such purposes and more particularly it is overlooked by an adjoining rising ground from whence it might be annoyed by missile weapons Some places similar in form have been esteemed camps fortified by the Danes  At about half a mile distance we viewed a place called MAYBROUGH this is a hill which arises gradually on every side about one hundred and forty paces from the level of the lands below forming the lower section of a regular coneThe ascent is on every side grown with oaks and ashes and seems to have been covered with wood for ages though no very ancient trees remain standing yet the reliques left by the ax evince it  The summit of the hill is fenced round save only an opening to the east of twelve paces widethe fence is very singular being composed of an immense quantity of loose pebble stones which seem to have been gathered from the river by their quality and the similarity there is between them and the gravel of the bed of the YeomanNo kind of mortar appears to have been used here the stones layed uncemented and in a heap which at the foot is near twenty paces wide rising to an edge in height at this day about eight feet from the level of the interior plainHere and there time has scattered a few trees and brushwood over the pebbles but in other places they are loose and naked both on the out∣side and inside of the fenceThe space within is a fine plain of meadow ground exactly circular of paces diameter inclining a little to the westward from  the centre a large mass of unhewn stone is standing erect placed with the smaller end in the earth on which some little ash trees have taken their growth by striking their roots into the natural fis∣sures of the stonethis stone is in cir∣cumference near its middle twentytwo feet and some inches and in height eleven feet and upwards it is a species of the free stone and has been gathered from the surface and not won in any quarry or bed of stoneThe inhabitants in the neighbourhood say that within the me∣mory of man two other stones of similar nature and placed in a kind of angular figure with the stone now remaining were to be seen there but as they were hurt∣ful to the ground had been destroyed and removed  The traditional account given of this place is in no wise to be credited  That  it was a Roman theatre where crimi∣nals had been exposed to wild beasts and that those stones were placed for the refuge and respite of the combatant in his unhappy conflict  The name of Maybrough induced us to believe that this had been a British fortification and that the name was a corruption of Maiden Burg a title given to many fortresses which were esteemed impregnable and which were boasted never to have known a conquerorbut the large stone placed within the plain and those said to have been defaced within the memory of man confounded this conjecture and prompted us to an idea that the whole was a druidical mo∣nument and the name of it Mayberie  Antiquarians have frequently confounded BURY for  BERIEthe one implying the tomb of some great or remarkable personage the latter Berie being the name of a plain or vale surrounded with groves and forests and held sacred by the ancient Britons  Lord COKE    or Maleberge  MALEBERGE Mon's Placiti a hill where the people assembled at a court like our assizes which by the Scots and Irish are called Parley Hills  The elevated plain the surrounding woods and this strange rude pillar render it probable that this was a temple of the druids where under the solemn shade of the consecrated grove they had exercised their religious rites and taught the multitude and also held those convocations in which they determined the rights of the people and administered public justicePerhaps when they were driven out of Mona and fled before the Roman sword they might  fortify their sacred places and gather their people into such strong holds to resist the power which had avowed their extirpation  We viewed the CHURCH OF PENRITH in the afternoon a handsome new build∣ing of red free stone well galleried and ornamented in the modern stilethe pillars are remarkable being one single stone The following inscription on a stone placed in the wall is singular  AD MDXCVIII  Ex gravi peste que regionibus hisce  incubuit obierunt apud  Penrith  Kendal  Richmond  Carlisle  Posteri  Avortite vos et virite  Ezek th  The plague raged in London in the thir∣tysixth year of Queen Elizabeth's reign  In the churchyard is a very remarka∣ble monument apparently of great anti∣quitytwo pillars are placed in a direc∣tion east and west distant from each other fifteen feetat the sides of the tomb two stones are placed with an edge upwards of a kind of semicircular form These side stones do not at present shew any marks of the sculptor tho' some have conjectured they represented boars The pillars are of one piece formed like the antient spears and about ten feet in heightthe shafts are round for about seven feet high above which they run into a square and appear to have termi∣nated in a point where the square point commences there are the remains of a narrow belt of ornamental frize work  The stones are so much hurt by time that it is not possible to ascertain whether the upper parts of these pillars have been adorned with figures or born any inscrip∣tionI must beg leave to dissent from the opinion of those who have presumed this was the tomb of some of the War∣wicks and as their reason alledge these were the representations of bears and a rag∣ged staff the device of that family I am induced to believe this is rather the mo∣nument of some British hero of distinc∣tion the custom of placing pillars at the head and foot of sepulchres is very an∣cient I have seen it mentioned in many of our historians that in the time of Richard the first the bones of Arthur the famous King of Britain were said to have been found at Glastonbury in an old sepulchre to denote which stood two pillars one at the head the other at the  feet on which some inscription had been cut but could not then be read in the notes to a book intitled the history of the Rebellion this monument is men∣tioned and said to be set up in memory of a famous old warrior Sir Ewen Caesa∣rius of great strength who was renown∣ed for his exploits in Inglewood forest in the destruction of wild boars  In our next excursion from Penrith we past by the antient seat of the Musgraves called EDEN HALL at the distance of three miles a stone structure built in the taste of the time of the Charles's Every part of the river Eden which we visited was picturesque and beautiful pretty lawns and meadows and here and there fine hanging groves were dispersed on its banks whilst the borders of the channel were beautified with rocks and  the stream flowed in meandrings or cas∣cades  Camden tells us  that Eden having given Eimot entertainment he turneth his course northward by both the Salkelds watering as he goes several obscure villages and fortresses amongst which at the Less Salkeld there are erected in form of a circle seventyseven stones every one ten feet high and a special one by itself before them at the very entrance riseth fifteen feet in height this stone the common people dwelling near the place call Long Meg and the rest her daughters Within this ring or circle are heaps of stones under which they say lie interred the bodies of men slain in battle and indeed there is reason to think that this was a monument of some victory there at∣chieved for no man could conjecture that they were erected in vain    Near to LITTLE SALKELD on the summit of a large hill inclining a little towards the north we had the pleasure of seeing a large and perfect druidical monument called by the country people MEG AND HER DAUGHTERS  A circle of three hundred and fifty paces circumference is formed by massy stones most of which remain standing uprightthese are sixtyseven in num∣ber of various qualities unhewn or touched with any tool and seem by their form to have been gathered from the sur∣face of the earthsome are of blue and grey limestone some of granite and some flintsmany of them which were stand∣ing measured from twelve to fifteen feet in girt and ten feet in height others were of an inferior sizeAt the southern side of this circle at the distance of seventeen paces from its nearest member is placed an upright stone naturally of a square form being a red freestone with which the country about Penrith aboundsThis stone is placed with one of its angles to∣wards the circle is near fifteen feet in girt and eighteen feet high each angle  of its square answering to a cardinal point In the most contiguous part of the circle four large stones are placed in a square form as if they had constructed or sup∣ported the altar And towards the east west and north two large stones are placed a greater distance from each other than any of the rest as if they had formed the entrances into this mystic roundWhat creates great asto∣nishment to the spectator is that no such stones or any quarry or bed of stones are to be found within a great distance of this place and how such massy bodies could be moved in an age when the me∣chanical powers were little known is not to be conceived  Whilst we stood admiring this place the following thoughts occured to my memory  "Mark yon altar  "This wide circus  "Skirted with unhewn stone they awe my soul  "As if the very genius of the place  "Himself appeared and with terrific tread  "Stalk'd through this drear domain"  "Know that thou stands on consecrated ground  "The mighty pile of magicplanted rock  "Thus rang'd in mystic order marks the place  "Where but at times of holiest festival  "The druid leads his train  Mason's Charactacus  "  My ideas wandered in the fields of imagination over the druids sacrifice of the milkwhite steers consecrated by the misletoeI reflected on the trembling enthusiastic multitudes who here per∣haps had assembled to hear the priestly dictates touching government and moral conductto learn the druids arrogant philosophy and superstitions and cherish an implicit faith of the immortality of  man's intellectual spirit though in trans∣migration to reptiles and beasts of prey Perhaps here Princes submissively have stood to hear the haughty druid ex∣laim  Thou art a king a sovereign o'er frail men  I am a druid servant of the Gods  Such service is above such sovereignty  Mason's Charactacus    In the number of stones Camden was mistaken as they are only sixtyseven in all He took many of his northern re∣marks from hearsay only from whence he was liable to the errors discovered in himAs to the heaps of stones within the circle which he was told covered those slain in fight there is not the least appearance of any such thingSince the monuments of Mona now Anglesie have been so learnedly visited and de∣fined  there is not the least reason to doubt this at Salkeld is a druidical monu∣ment from its similarity to those re∣maining there  Near to a place called Ninechurches we visited two caves the one hollowed in the rock of a circular form with seats cut in its sides the roof being supported in the midst by a rude pillar of mason work this is called the Giant's cave the other cave is also circular with a stone table in the midstThere is no tradition to lead one to conjecture by whom these caves were madetheir antiquity is greatly to be doubted they seem as if they had been the work of some religious for retirement but the name of no such person remains to us  We also visited a place called Force Mill near to Great Salkeld where a cave  was said to be the object of travellers cu∣riosityhere we found some seats cut under the shelves of a rock commanding a romantic view upon the river Eden but no otherwise remarkableThe falls of the river the hanging rocks rich meadows and hills cloathed with wood presented us with prospects which amply repaid the disappointment our curiosity sustained  We lamented to see such extensive wasts and uncultivated lands adjoining to so beautiful a place as Penrith whose situa∣tion must necessarily circumscribe its trade  The women of this country are re∣markably beautifulthe bold u  intelli∣gent stare the fluttering inconsiste  t pert∣ness and lisping nonsense so charac∣teristic of the sex in southern counties  are here totally neglected for intelligent looks cloathed in modesty and politeness united with simplicity of manners  We had the pleasure of seeing some bo∣tanical paintings executed by Miss Cal∣vin of this place which in delicacy of colouring and taste in the disposition of the foliage and flowers together with the justness of the work may vie with any painting of that kind in EuropeTo the honour of Lady Mary Lowther this young Lady is under her patronage by whom it is not to be doubted her ex∣traordinary merit will be made known to the world  This place owns another very re∣markable genius Mr Fawell who tho' blind from his infancy can perform any piece of musical composition on the harp∣sicord  having the piece set by wooden pins in a board after the manner of a cribbage board which after perusing by the feeling of his fingers from the strong retention of his memory he performs with great accuracy  The way from PENRITH to KESWICK though a good turnpike is yet very dull and tedious for during the course of eighteen miles we met with nothing to amuse till we arrived near the place The mountains we passed are of various figures and some very lofty and as we still advanced nearer to Keswick they straitened the valley in which we rode  We now gained a view of the vale of ST JOHN's a very narrow dell hem∣med in by mountains through which a small brook makes many meandrings washing little inclosures of grass ground  which stretch up the risings of the hills In the widest part of the dale you are struck with the appearance of an ancient ruined castle which seems to stand upon the summit of a little mount the moun∣tains around forming an amphitheatre This massive bulwark shews a front of various towers and makes an awful rude and gothic appearance with its lofty turrets and its ragged battlementswe traced the galleries the bending arches the butrassesthe greatest antiquity stands characterized in its architecture the inhabitants near it assert it is an antediluvian structure  The travellers curiosity is rouzed and he prepares to make a nearer ap∣proach when that curiosity is put upon the rack by his being assured that if he advances certain genii who govern the place by virtue of their supernatural arts  and necromancy will strip it of all its beauties and by inchantment transform the magic walls upon his approachThe vale seems like the habitation of such beingsits gloomy recesses and retire∣ments look like the haunts of evil spirits there was no delusion in the report we were soon convinced of its truthfor this piece of antiquity so venerable and noble in its aspect as we drew near to it changed its figure and proved no other than a shaken massive pile of rocks which stand in the midst of this little vale disunited from the adjoining moun∣tains and have so much the real form and resemblance of a castle that they bear the name of THE CASTLE ROCKS OF ST JOHN'S  The delusion afforded us matter of laughter till we descended towards the vale of Keswick  The town of KESWICK lying in a deep valley was not to be seen till we were within a very little distanceAs we de∣scended the hill a fine prospect opened upon usthe hills on the right of the road are very grand enclosures of mea∣dow and pasture take up about onethird of the ascent the creeks are every where grown with wood which climbs up shade above shade and their crowns are co∣vered with herbage and heath Beneath us laid a plain of about three miles dia∣meter diversified with plots of corn a∣greeably mingling with the meadows and here and there little cops of ashes The Lake of BASNET which has nothing remarkable to engage the traveller's atten∣tion but a long canal of water termina∣ted the plain to the right the Lake of Keswick to the left around which moun∣tains piled on mountains made an awful  circle and seemed to shut them in from all the world  KESWICK is but a mean village without any apparent tradethe houses are homely and dirtythere is a town house in the market place said to be e∣rected out of the ruins of Lord Darn∣water's mansion but of the most uncouth architectureThere are very indifferent accommodations here for travellersNo∣thing is more disagreeable to people who wish to see every thing that is curious in a place they visit than to meet with a drunken soporiferous Innkeeper whose small share of natural intelligence is to∣tally absorbed and who has nothing re∣maining of human but his distorted image and his impertinenceSuch was our host at Keswick  From a short description of the beauties  of Keswick which was written by the late ingenious Dr Brown and which we had then in our hands we were impatient to enter upon the Lake and thought every delay irksome which kept us from the inchanting scene  Dr  BROWN's LETTER  printed at  NEWCASTLE  in the year    In my way to the north from Hagley I passed through Dovedale and to say the truth was disappointed in it When I came to Buxton I visited another or two of their romantic scenes but these are inferior to Dovedale They are but poor miniatures of Keswick which ex∣ceeds them more in grandeur than I can give you to imagine and more if possible in beauty than in grandeur  Instead of the narrow slip of valley which is seen at Dovedale you have at Keswick a vast amphitheatre in circumference above twenty miles Instead of a meagre rivulet a noble living Lake ten miles round of an oblong form adorned with variety of wooded islands The rocks indeed of Dovedale are finely wild pointed  and irregular but the hills are both little and unani∣mated and the margin of the brook is poorly edged with weeds morass and brushwood But at Keswick you will on one side of the Lake see a rich and beauti∣ful landskip of cultivated fields rising to the eye in fine inequalities with noble groves of oak happily dispersed and climbing the adjacent hills shade above shade in the most various and picturesque forms On the most op∣posite shore you will find rocks and cliffs of stupendous height hanging broken over the Lake in horrible grandeur some of them a thousand feet high the woods climbing up their steep and shaggy sides where mortal foot never yet approached On these dreadful heights the eagles build their nests A variety of waterfalls are seen pouring from their summits and tumbling in vast sheets from rock to rock in rude and terrible magnifi∣cence While on all sides of this immense amphitheatre the lofty mountains rise round piercing the clouds in shapes as spiry and fantastic as the very rocks of Dove∣dale To this I must add the frequent and bold projec∣tion of the cliffs into the Lake forming noble bays and  promontories In other parts they finely retire from it and often open in abrupt casms or clefts through which at h  d you see rich and cultivated vales and beyond these at various distance mountains rising over mountains among which new prospects present themselves in mist till the eye is lost in an agreeable perplexity  Where active fancy travels beyond sense  And pictures things unseen  Were I to analyse the two places into their constituent principles I should tell you that the full perfection of Keswick consists of three circumstances beauty horror and immensity united the second of which is alone found in Dovedale Of beauty it hath little Nature having left it almost a desart Neither its small extent nor the diminutive and liveless form of the hills admit magnificence But to give you a complete idea of these three perfections as they are joined in Keswick would require the united powers of Claude Salvator and Poussin The first should throw his delicate sunshine over the cultivated vales the scattered cots the groves the Lake and wooded islands The second should dash out the horror of the rugged cliffs the steeps the hang∣ing  woods and foaming waterfalls while the grand pencil of Poussin should crown the whole with the Ma∣jesty of the impending mountains  So much for what I would call the permanent beau∣ties of this astonishing scene Were I not afraid of being tiresome I could now dwell as long on its varying or accidental beauties I would sail round the Lake anchor in every bay and land you on every promontory and island I would point the perpetual change of pros∣pect the woods rocks cliffs and mountains by turns vanishing or rising into view Now gaining on the sight hanging over our heads in their full dimensions beautifully dreadful and now by a change of situa∣tion assuming new romantic shapes retiring and lessen∣ing on the eye insensibly losing themselves in an azure mist I would remark the contrast of light and shade produced by the morning and evening sun the one gilding the western and the other the eastern side of this immense amphitheatre while the vast shadow projected by the mountains buries the opposite part in a deep and purple gloom which the eye can hardly penetrate The natural variety of colouring which the several objects  produce is no less wonderful and pleasing The ruling  nts in the valley being those of azure green and gold yet ever various arising from an intermixture of the Lake the woods the grass and corn fields These are finely contrasted by the grey rocks and cliffs and the whole beightened by the yellow streams of light the purple hues and misty azure of the mountains Some∣times a serene air and clear sky disclose the tops of the highest hills at others you see clouds involving their summits resting on their sides or descending to their base and rolling among the vallies as in a vast furnace When the winds are high they roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder then too the clouds are seen in vast bodies sweeping along the hills in gloomy greatness while the Lake joins the tumult and tosses like a sea But in calm weather the whole scene becomes new the Lake is a perfect mirror and the landskip in all its beauty islands fields woods rocks and mountains are seen inverted and floating on its surface I will now carry you to the top of a cliff where if you dare approach the ridge a new scene of astonishment presents itself where the valley Lake and islands seem lying at your feet where this expanse of water ap∣pears  diminished to a little pool amidst the vast immea∣surable objects that surround it for here the summits of more distant hills appear above those you have already seen and rising behind each other in successive ranges and azure groups of craggy and broken steeps form an immense and awful picture which can only be expressed by the image of a tempestuous sea of mountainsLet me now conduct you down again to the valley and conclude with one circumstance more which is that a walk by still moon light at which time the distant waterfalls are heard in all their variety of sound among these inchanting dales opens a scene of such delicate beauty repose and solemnity as exceeds all description    We hasted thither and from COCK∣SHOOTHILL took a general survey of the  Lake which though inferior in size to Hull'swater is yet very different in its  beauties and afforded us many delight∣full scenesThe water which still bears  the name of DERNWATER tho' embodied in so great a Lake said to be ten miles in  circumference was transparent as chrystal and shining as a mirror over whose sur∣face five fine islands were dispersed the nearest in view was covered with yellow corn the rest cloathed in wood the hills are lofty arising on every side from the margin of the Lake  Here the mountains were in some parts covered with grass in others heath  there the rocks were grown with shrubs and brush wood which hung in their apertures and creeksLittle valleys of cultivated land presented themselves in the openings and windings of the mountains and small inclosures and groves of oaks stretched up the precipitate ascents of every hill from the brink of the water save only at the head of the bason where the mountains were more rugged and ro∣manticWe hurried to the boat that we might enjoy the pleasures of this place in their greatest perfectionThe general view was magnificent and beautiful but we wanted to take each pleasing scene apart  The following verses are taken from Dr Dalton's Descriptive Poem in the Continuation of Dodsley's Collection vol I  To nature's pride  Sweet Keswick's vale the muse will guide  The muse who trod th' enchanted ground  Who sail'd the wond'rous Lake around  With you will haste once more to hail  The beauteous brook of Borrodale  From savage parent gentle stream  Be thou the muses favourite theme  O soft insinuating glide  Silent along the meadow's side  Smooth o'er the sandy bottom pass  Resplendent all through fluid glafs  Unless upon thy yielding breast  Their heads the painted lillies rest  To where in deep capacious bed  The widely liquid Lake is spread  Let other streams rejoice to roar  Down the rough rocks of dread Lodore  Rush raving on with boist'rous sweep  And foaming rend the frighted deep  Thy gentle genius shrinks away  From such a rude unequal fray  Through thine own native dale where rise  Tremendous rocks amid the skies  Thy waves with patience slowly wind  Till they the smoothest channel find  Soften the horrors of the scene  And through confusion flow serene  Horrors like these at first alarm  But soon with savage grandeur charm  And raise to noblest thoughts your mind  Thus by thy fall Lodore reclin'd  The cragged cliff impending wood  Whose shadows mix o'er half the flood  The gloomy clouds with solemn sail  Scarce lifted by the languid gale  O'er the capp'd hill and darken'd vale  The ravening kite and bird of Jove  Which round th' aerial ocean move  And floating on the billowy sky  With fullexpanded pinions fly  Their flutt'ring or their bleating prey  Thence with deathdooming eye survey  Channels by rocky torrents torn  Rocks to the Lake in thunder born  Or such as o'er our heads appear  Suspended in the mid career  To start again at his command  Who rules fire water air and land  I view with wonder and delight  A pleasing though an awful sight  For seen with them the verdant isles  Soften with more delicious smiles  More tempting twine their opening bowers  More lively flow the purple flowers  More smoothly slopes the border gay  In fairer circle bends the bay  And last to fix our wandring eyes  Thy roofs O Keswick brighter rise  The Lake and lofty hills between  Where giant Skiddow shuts the scene  Supreme of mountains Skiddow hail  To whom all Britain sinks a vale  Lo his imperial brow I see  From foul usurping vapours free  'Twere glorious now his side to climb  Boldly to scale his top sublime  And thence  My muse these flights forbear  Nor with wild raptures tire the fair  Hills rocks and dales have been too long  The subject of my rambling song  We ordered the boatmen to coast round the nearest island called VICAR's  ISLAND containing about six acres of corn land on the eastern side of which a  few sycamores formed a little grove co∣vering a hovel which varied the hue  with a rich green and gave to the whole a picturesque appearanceHere we found a sweet shade whilst we hung upon our oars to listen to the sound of the water∣falls which struck the ear from every side with an agreeable solemnity  Now we had the valley to the right opening upon our view and extending a rich plain towards the northwest three or four miles in breadththe strips of corn and little groves scattered here and there gave the most pleasing variety when contrasted with the verdure of the  mown meads struck by the rays of the morning sun and happily opposed to the adjoining mountainsIn this vale the church with some seat houses shewed their white fronts over which the moun∣tains arising to the right were stupendous and gloomy as they stood covered with cloudsThere SKIDDOW raised his head and with a peaked brow overlooked Sad∣dleback and Cawseypike together with a chain of mountains stretching away to∣wards the northwest whilst on the other hand the hills and rocks which stand up∣on the Basnetwater form the other wing of an lofty avenue of mountains which extend into the distant plains  We were told by a person we met with at Keswick that Skiddow from the plane of the Lake's surface is three thousand four hundred and fifty feet in  perpendicular height but as we had no means of proving the truth of this calcu∣lation must leave it to others to aseer∣tain  Since this work was in the press the ingenious Mr Walker of Manchester who was in a Course of Lec∣tures on natural philosophy at Stockton upon Tees fa∣voured me with the following remarks on the altitude of Skiddow  Barometer at Whitehaven  ° ′  Feet  Fell same day in ascending the mountain    By table  Stood on the top at       By angle from the Lake of Bassenthwaite to the top of Skiddow         We coasted the right hand side of the Lake where the hills gradually re∣tiring from its margin rise to their sum∣mits covered with herbage Here we had a view of the little valley of NEW∣LAND which winds about the feet of the mountains and with the finest ver∣dure  from the small inclosures of grass ground refreshes the eye which had la∣boured with upstretched looks over the vast heights that on every side shut it in there cattle and sheep were seen pastu∣ring some little cottages were dispersed amongst the hedgerow ashes whilst the shadows of the hills suffered the sunshine to fall only in strips over the vale  We landed at ST HERBERT's ISLAND  Camden writing of Keswick says  the Darwent having his first beginning in Borodale a v  ley hem∣med in with crooked hills creepeth between the mountains  which contains about five acres of land now covered with young trees famous for being the residence of St Herbert a Priest and Confessor who to avoid the intercourse of man and that nothing might withdraw his attention  from unceasing mortification and prayer chose this island for his abodeThe scene around him was adapted to his gloomy ideas of religionhe was sur∣rounded by the Lake which afforded him fish for his dieton every hand the voice of waterfalls excited the solemnest strains of meditationrocks and moun∣tains were his daily prospect where bar∣renness and solitude seemed to take up their eternal abodefrom the situation of this place nature had given three parts of the year to impetuous hurricanes and storms the fourth alone provided for the restHere this recluse erected an hermitage the remains of which ap∣pear to this day being a building of stone formed into two apartments the outward one about twenty feet long and fifteen broad the other of narrower di∣mensionsHe was a cotemporary with ST CUTHBERT and as the legends of  that time say by the prayers of that saint obtained a joint or equotemporary death with him in the year of our Lord six hundred and eightyeight  The passion for solitude and a recluse life which reigned in the days of this saint and was cherished by the monastic school although at first sight may appear to us uncouth and enthusiastic yet when we examine into those times our astonish∣ment will cease whilst we consider the estate of those men who under all the prejudices of education were living in an age of ignorance vassalage and ra∣pine and we shall rather applaud than condemn a devotee who disgusted with the world and the sins of men consigns his life to the service of the deity in re∣tirementWe may suppose we hear the saint exclaiming with the poet  Blest be that hand divine which gently laid  My heart at rest beneathed this humble shed  The world's a stately bark on dang'rous seas  With pleasure seen but boarded at our peril  Here on a single plank thrown safe on shore  I hear the tumult of the distant throng  As that of seas remote or dying storms  And meditate on scenes more silent still  Pursue my theme and fight the fear of death  Here like a shepherd gazing from his hut  Touching his reed or leaning on his staff  Eager ambition's fiery chace I see  I see the circling hunt of noisy men  Burst law's inclosure leap the mounds of right  Pursuing and pursued each other's prey  As wolves for rapine as the fox for wiles  Till death that mighty hunter earths them all  Young    I fell into a reverie and begun to mut∣ter thus to myself  It seems unnatural for man to deny himself of the aid and consolation which  are derived from society and to con∣temn the sweets of friendshipThe poet says  "Poor is the friendless master of a world  Young  "  When we talk of friendship in gene∣ral the friendship of the world we are amusing ourselves with a superficial view where objects are so grooped and colours fall in such a happy assem∣blage that all is beautiful and delight∣ingbut when greater curiosity or necessity demands a strict survey of the several images which formed this plea∣sing prospect you find on their sepa∣ration that they lose that excellence which their union or their distance maintainedThere is little of true friendship on this stage to enhance the value of lifethe corruptions of the  age have contaminated it and scarce any thing more is left than the name when it is even found with consan∣guinity it is a rare essence at which men stand agapeI have known exam∣ples where genius and merit have dawned upon a youth surrounded with opulent friends who have stood gazing on him like statues of stone without stretching forth a hand to save him from poverty whilst the fine gifts that providence had endowed him with languished in fetters which by their patronage might have been brought forth and saved even by the crumbs which fell from the rich man's tableI doubted not the eye of hea∣ven regarded their insensibility with kindling wrath and to reward the sa∣crilege deprived them of every enjoy∣ment with which the finer feelings of the soul bless mankind and left them  nothing but the animal oeconomy and the disgraced image of humanity  I had shewn some distortions in my agitation through this whispered solilo∣quy but uttering these last words with a degree of vehemence arising on the pro∣gress of my ideas my companion catched me by the arm and roused me saying  The boatmen already think they have got a passenger that is frantic and express by their looks their wishes to be rid of us  Camden writes  that at Newlandside and else∣where copper mines were discovered by Thomas Shurland and Daniel Hotchstatter a German of Auspurge in our days and yet the same were known before as appears by the Close Rolls of King Henry the third Upon the discovery of these mines there was a memorable case in law between Queen Elizabeth  and Thomas Piercie Earl of Northumberland in whose Lordship they were found but by reason of the Queen's prerogative and veins of gold and silver discovered therein they were adjudged to the crown here black lead is also foundDerwent after its passage through these hills spreads itself into a large Lake Bede termeth it Praegrande Stagnum wherein are three islands eminent above the waterthe one hath an house of the Ratcliffs a family of Knight's de∣gree the second is inhabited by the Dutch mineral men and the third is thought to be that where Bede wrote that St Herbert lived an hermitical life On the very skirt of this vale in a pleasant soil encom∣passed with dewy hills and sheltered towards the north by that high mountain Skiddow lieth Keswick a little town which King Edward the First made a market by the application of Sir Thomas of Dern∣water Lord of the place from whom it lineally de∣scended to the family of the RatcliffsAs for the mountain Skiddow it riseth up to such a height with two heads like to Parnassus and with a kind of  emulation looks on Scruffel hill before it in Annan∣dale in Scotland that from these two mountains as the misty clouds rise or fall the people of the country make their prognostications of the change of weather and have this proverb  If Skiddow hath a cap  Scruffel wots weel of that    But to return to our hermit there is no history of his life and actions to be met  with or any tradition of his works of piety or miracles preserved by the in∣habitants of the country  We now pursued our voyage by a noble woody scene where BRANDELOW PARKE arising from the edge of the Lake with stately young oaks extends its groves over two round hoes or emi∣nences and behind them after covering a little intervening valley rises on the side of a mountain to a considerable height and forms a woody amphitheatre fringed with some small strips of corn which grow under its skirts whilst all above  are stupendous hills and rocksThe strait boles of the trees together with the verdure of the ground under their shadow which was perceived a great depth in the grove by reason of the distance at which the trees stood from each other formed an uncommon and solemn scene which being again represented by the re∣flection of the water seemed like inchanted haunts where driads met with naids in the happy regions of the genius of the Lake  We arrived at the borders of MA∣NISTY MEADOW a flat of a few acres at the foot of the mountains where we an∣chord our boat to enjoy the pleasures of the situationto the left the nearest ob∣ject was a wooded island edged with rocks behind which Brandelow Park and oaken groves drest in the deepest green  covered the hills which arose immediately from the margin of the Lake and from thence stretched up the foot of CATBELL's mountain which laid so near to us that it required the eye which viewed its sum∣mit to be turned upwards directly to heavenon our right at the distance of about one hundred yards laid another small island on whose rocky margin brush wood and willows hung fantasti∣cally above whose thickets the distant shores were seen where the mighty cliffs of FALCON and WALLOW CRAGS pro∣jecting shewed their grotesque and tre∣mendous brows in a lofty line of rocks beneath the feet of which a strip of culti∣vated lands and woods shot forth a ver∣dant promontory which sunk gradually in∣to the Lakein the centre of this view after stretching the eye for the distance of three miles over a bason of the clearest and  smoothest water spreading its bosom to the noontide sun is a large mount called CASTLEHEAD ROCKS rising in a cone and covered with oak wood behind which a lofty mountain raised its brown brow drest in heath and sunburnt her∣bage exceeded only by SKIDDOW co∣vered with blue vapour and capped with clouds which terminated the prospect  HULL'sWATER gives you a few but noble and extensive scenes which yield astonishment whilst KESWICK a∣bounds with variety with wilder and more romantic prospects  After passing BANK PARK a rocky and barren promontory on which a few scattered trees looked deplorably aged and torn we entered a fine bay where the mountains rise immediately out of the Lake here standing perpendicular  there falling back in ruinous and rude confusion as being piled heap on heap from the convulsions of chaos in the be∣ginning and in other parts shelving and hanging over the Lake as if they threat∣ened an immediate fallthe whole forming a stupendous circus  To describe this view is difficult as no expression can convey an idea of the subject where the wild variety consists only of various features of the same ob∣jects rocks and mountains forming and constituting the parts of this massive theatreIn the front of this romantic scene a small mount presents itself co∣vered with herbage small from the mighty stature and gigantic members of the other parts of the prospectOver∣looking this mount stands a round rock pushing his mountainous brow into the clouds On the summit of the mount  sweetly contrasted by the grey rocks be∣hind there grows with peculiar pic∣turesque beauties a single ancient oak The Lake beneath was a perfect mir∣ror  O'er which the giant oak himself a grove  Flings his romantic branches and beholds  His rev'rend image in th' expanse below  Mason's Garden    On each hand the cliffs and moun∣tains are strewed over with bushes and shrubs down whose sides small streams of water trill like so many threads of silver giving a delicate mixture to the greyness of the rocks over which they passed and which in many places arise perpendicular and are rent into a thou∣sand rude columns as if they had been torn by thunderbolts in other places they are of a tamer aspect and compacted  in one solid mass stand with firmness as the pillars of the antediluvian world Where the hills were separated little vales filled with wood or narrow wind∣ing dells of grass ground twist around their feet and give a happy variegation to the viewIn some places clefts in the rocks afforded a prospect into a valley behind in others the overhanging cliffs formed rude arches and apertures through which distant mountains were discoveredBehind all were mountains piled on mountains where the clouds rolled in heavy volumes giving a gloomi∣ness to those regions of confusion and barrenness which rendered the lustre of the shining Lake and the streams of light which fell upon the rocks waterfalls and shrubs brighter and more pleasing Here  E'en in the dull unseen unseeing dell  Shall Contemplation imp  Her eagle plumes the poet here shall hold  Sweet converse with his muse the curious sage  Who comments on great nature's ample tome  Shall find that volume hereFor here are caves  Where rise those gurgling rills that sing the song  Which Contemplation loves here shadowy glades  Where thro' the tremulous foliage darts the ray  That gilds the poet's daydream  Mason's Garden    In the cliffs in this part of the Lake eagles build their nests far removed above the reach of gunshot and undis∣turbed by men for no adventurous foot ever dared to assail their lofty habitation In the sight of the cottager hither they bring the spoils of the fold or the field to feed their young superior to the wrath of the injured  On these shores a salt spring of very salubrious quality is found but like the  sulpher spring of Hull'swater is ne∣glected  We next visited a very extraordinary phenomenon an island about forty yards in length and thirty in breadth grown over with rushes reeds grass and some willowsWe would have landed upon it but as the water was said to be forty fathom deep in that place and the at∣tempt rather hazardous we desisted and had not the means of inquiring particu∣larly into its natureThis island arose about four perpendicular feet above the surface of the water on which it floated from its magnitude we were not able with one boat to try whether it would move from the perpendicular line of its then station or whether it was bound to and connected with the bottom of the Lake by the roots of any aquatic plants which appeared upon its surface  The boatmen told us that it had not floated for two years before and that it is seen at many seasons by reason of the clearness of the water a great way from the surface in its action of rising or sub∣siding as it frequently descends to and rests upon the bottom of the Lake but it never shifts its stationThis change of floating or sinking cannot be effected by any greater or less quantity of water in the Lake at any one season for on enquiry we found in the rainy seasons the Lake is very little encreased in height its outlets receiving the additional water as fast as it flows in  We now pushed up the river which feeds the Lake and anchored near a little but pleasant habitation called LOCHDOOR or LODORE a place per∣fectly adapted for the abode of a recluse  and much preferable to St Herbert's I∣sland lying open to the southern sun sheltered from the north by mighty mountains which almost overhang it and fronting to the widest part of the bason it commands a view of the several islands Manisty meadows and Brande∣low parks with their oaken groves hang∣ing from the ascent of the mountains shade above shadeCatbell's and the adjoining crags surmounting all  We were landed on a plain of mea∣dow ground which descended to the edge of the water over which we passed to an adjoining wood at the foot of the rocks behind the Lodore houseAfter winding through several passes in these groves and thickets we gained a situ∣ation where we were delighted with the noble objects which presented themselves to our view  Around us was spread a grove formed of tall young oaks ash and birch trees which gave an agreeable coolness and shadeabove the trees with uplifted looks to the right we view∣ed a mountain of rock called Shepherds Crag forming a rude circular mass shelving from the foot towards its crown in a spiral form on every plane of which and every step that hung upon its sides herbage and shrubs grew fantasticly whilst the very summit wore a verdant cap of grassTo the left there arose a perpen∣dicular grey cliff said to be a thousand feet in height from the Lake rent into innumerable fissures and standing like massive columns in rude arrangment to support the seeming ruins of a shattered tower grown white with storms and overlooking Shepherds Crag some hun∣dred feetIn the opening between these  stupendous rocks the river pours its whole stream forming a grand cascade near two hundred perpendicular feet highas the channel is rugged the water makes a sheet of foam and roars amongst the caverns and the cliffs so that you are deprived of hearing any thing beside its tumultreaching the wood where the descent is less precipitate it winds amongst the trees some times shewing itfelf and at others totally con∣cealed whilst it serpentines towards the LakeThe spray which is dashed around the rocks and carried upon the breeze where ever it meets the rays of the sun through the openings of the cliffs takes the colours of the rainbow  One would conceive Thompson had this cataract in his eye when he wrote his seasons  Smooth to the shelving brink a copious flood  Rolls fair and placid where collected all  In one impetuous torrent down the steep  It thundering shoots and shakes the country round  At first an azure sheet it rushes broad  Then whitening by degrees as prone it falls  And from the loud resounding rocks below  Dashed in a cloud of foam it sends aloft  A hoary mist and forms a ceaseless show'r  Nor can the tortur'd wave here find repose  But raging still amid the shaggy rocks  Now flashes o'er the scattered fragments now  Aslant the hollowed channel rapid darts  And falling fast from gradual slope to slope  With wild infracted course and less'ned roar  It gains a safer bed and steals at last  Along the mazes of the quiet vale  On turning from this grand spectacle the greatest beauties of this Lake are thrown into one prospectThe ground whereon we stood was rugged and rocky shadowed with treeslooking over a rich bosom of wood below us lay the Lodore meadows where groops of cattle  were dispersed and by the shore some carpenters were repairing their boats a circumstance which enlivened the scene the shining Lake laid in one smooth plane reflecting the azure sky chequered with clouds over which the vicar's i∣sland yellow with corn and the woody islands were fortunately arrangedthe mountains whose feet were trimmed with wood lay in long perspective to the left Castlehead with its embowered cone and Lord's Island arising from the opposite shore intervened between us and the vale of Keswick which laid on the back ground coloured with all the beauteous tinctures of summer over which the awful Skiddow with his inferior race of mountains frowned in azure majesty and closed the scene  Here were all those beauties of co∣louring which the late Dr Brown de∣scribed  The natural variety and co∣louring which the several objects pro∣duce is no less wonderful than pleasing the ruling teints of the valley being those of azure green and gold yet ever various arising from an intermix∣ture of the Lake the woods the grass and corn fields these are finely con∣trasted by the grey rocks and cliffs and the whole heightened by the yellow streams of light the purple hues and misty azure of the mountains  In this prospect one finds all the or∣der and beauty of colouring mentioned by Mason  Vivid green  Warm brown and black opake the foreground bears  Conspicuoussober olive coldly marks  The second distance thence the third declines  In softer blue or less'ning still is lost  In faintest purple  Claude in his happiest hour never struck out a finer landskip it has every requisite which the pencil can demand and is perhaps the only view in England which can vie with the sublime scenes from which that painter formed his taste  We now returned to our boat an sailing within some little distance of the shore had a view of the waterfall where the beauties of the Lake to the south east lay in a pleasing perspectivewe looked over a small part of the bason from whence to the left a stupendous moun∣tain of rock arose on whose skirts and in the rents and clefts of whose sides trees and shrubs climbed almost to the very summitbefore us laid the wood from which we had lately passed under whose shade Lodore house and inclosures  were seen inclining towards the Lake above which the lofty precipice the wa∣terfall and Shepherds Crag were seen in all their variety of beauties whilst all beyond the mountains formed a crescent enclasping a sheet of water of two miles circuitMountain behind mountain and rock behind rock fell here in fine perspective and brought to our minds those astonishing scenes which charac∣terize the pencil of Salvator  We passed from hence in our return to Keswick by the coast where we were shewn a cliff that projected over the Lake called EVE's CRAG from its bear∣ing some similitude to a female Colossian statueWe next passed WALLOW CRAG in which a large opening is formed by the parting of the rocks bearing the name of Lady's Rake from the escape  which Lady Dernwater made there by climbing these horrid and stupendous heights with such jewels and valuables as she could secure when her unfortunate Lord was apprehended for a traitor  We now reached Lord's Island con∣taining some few acres covered with wood where are the remains of a man∣sion of the Dernwater family Formerly this was only a peninsula but when the place was made the residence of the Rad∣cliffs and Dernwaters it was severed from the main land by a ditch over which was thrown a drawbridgeThis must have been a beautiful retirementTra∣vellers cannot behold the ruins of this place without yielding a sigh for the sins of the world and bewailing the dire effects which attend on ambition and the crimes of princes  We visited a DRUIDICAL MONU∣MENT within about two miles of Kes∣wick situate to the south of the road which we had passed from Penrith  This monument is placed on a plain formed on the summit of a hill around which the adjoining mountains make a solemn circleit is composed of stones of various forms natural and unhewn they seemed to have been collected from the surface but from what lands it is impossible to conjecture most of them being a species of graniteThese stones are fifty in number and are set in a form not exactly circular the diameter being thirty paces from east to west and thirtytwo from north to south at the eastern end a small inclosure is formed within the circle by ten stones making an oblong  square in conjunction with the stones of that side of the circle seven paces in length and three in width within In this place we conjectured the altar had been erectedAt the opposite side a single square stone is laid at the distance of three paces from the circlepossibly this may have been broken off and is only the foot of such a column as Long Meg in the Salkeld monument which may have been used to bind the victims toThe stones forming the outward line are some of them standing erect others fallen and the same observation is to be made as to the appearance of entrances as at Salkeld The stones here are of various sizes some of the largest of those which are standing being near eight feet in height and fifteen feet in circumference  A clergyman whose property the  pasture ground is in which this monu∣ment stands and with whom we gained an acquaintance during our stay at Keswick told us he was determined to destroy the place as it prejudiced his ground so that perhaps by these sacrilegious hands the curious will shortly be deprived of this valuable piece of antiquity  A late descovery has been made of large quantities of black lead a mineral peculiar to this country and no where else to be found in Europe amongst the gravel and earth on the shore of Vicar's islandWhether it has lodged there by the floods or how otherwise been collect∣ed is not known but so valuable the discovery was thought that it occasioned an enquiry by what means the whole Lake might be drained conceiving that from this specimen immense wealth  would be obtained by such an undertak∣ing  The fish of this Lake are trouts pike eels and perch  The romantic scenes upon the Lake in∣duced us to take a boat at night under the favour of the moon which was near the fullwe began our voyage soon af∣ter the moon was risen and she had illu∣mined the top of Skiddow but from the intercepting mountains had not within the ascent of an hour reached the Lake we were surrounded with a solemn gloomthe stilness of the evening render∣ed the voice of the waterfalls tremendous as they in all their variety of sounds were reechoed from every cavernthe summits of the rocks began to receive the rising rays and seemed to be crowned  with turrets of silver from which the stars departed for their nightly round As the light advanced objects arose to view as if surging on the first morning from chaosthe water was a plain of sable sprinkled over with gems reflected from the starry firmamentthe groves which hung upon the feet of the moun∣tains were hid in darkness and all was one grave and majestic circle of shadow  till the moon  Rising in cloudy majesty at length  Aparent Queen unveil'd her peerless light  And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw  Milton's Paradise Lost    When the long protracted shadows of the mountains cast on the bosom of the Lake shewed the vastness of those masses from whence they proceeded and still as the moon arose higher in the horizon  the distant objects began to be illumined and the whole presented us with a noble moonlight piece delicately touched by the hand of nature and far surpassing those humble scenes which we had often viewed in the works of the Flemish painters  Mists began to arise on the Lake and by reason of the air which bore them aloft being confined and eddying with∣in this deep circle they were whirled round and carried upwards like a column which so soon as it approached the rays of the moon had a most wonderful ap∣pearance and resembled a pillar of light  I recollect that Maupertuis describ∣ing the Lake and mountain of Niemi in Lapland speaks of a Phenomenon of the like nature which the people called Hal∣tios and which they esteemed to be the  guardian spirits of the placeBe these as they might we may venture to assert no druid no St Herbert no genius had a more glorious ascension  The moon's mild beams now glistned on the waters and touched the groves the cliffs and islands with a meekness of colouring which added to the solemnity of the night and these noble and ro∣mantic objects struck us with reverence and inspired the mind with pious senti∣ments and ejaculationsIt was observa∣ble that by day we were incessantly com∣municating our raptures and surprise on each new wonder that opened to our viewwe now enjoyed them in silence  Every bay and each promontary assumed an appearance very different from what it had by day lightthe little  dells which wind around the feet of the mountains as they were shadowed by in∣terposing objects or silvered by the moon afforded most enchanting scenes where we might have wandered with delight through the whole night  Where the Lake narrows and runs up in a creek towards BORODALE the rocks looked horrible almost shutting us in from the face of heaven which could be beheld only by looking immediately upright the cliffs were struck with scanty gleams of light which gained their pas∣sage through the interstices of the hills or chasms in the rocks and served only to discover their tremendous overhanging fronts their mighty caverns where the water struck by our oars made a hollow sound their deformed and frowning brows the hanging shrubs with which they were bearded their sparkling water∣falls  that trilled from shelf to shelf the whole half seen and half concealed leav∣ing imagination at large to magnify the images of their grandeur and horrible magnificence  The pursuit which engaged us the next morning was to gain the summit of SKIDDOW which by the winding pass we were obliged to make afforded a labo∣rious ascent of five milesThe prospect which we gained from this eminence very well rewarded our fatigueto the south east we had a view over the tops of moun∣tains one succeeding to or overlooking the other a scene of chaos and mighty confusion this was the prospect which Dr Brown described by the image of "a tempestuous sea of mountains"be∣low us laid the Lake with all the beau∣ties of its margin together with the vale of Keswick and the waters of Basnet  as if delineated on a chartTo the south the hills towards Cockermouth though less rugged and romantic than those towards the south east were yet no less stupendousTo the north west we had the prospect of a wide and barren heath extending its plains to Carlisle and terminated by the mountains of ScotlandTo the north east we regained the prospect of that spacious circus in which Penrith stands the Queen of the vale overtopped by Cross Fell which forms the most distant back ground  The air was remarkably sharp and thin compared with that from which we passed in the valley and respiration seemed to be performed with a kind of asthmatic oppression  Whilst we remained upon the moun∣tain  over the hills which lay between Keswick and Cockermouth dense and dark vapours began to arise and in a little time as they advanced upon a south west wind concealed from us those heights which we had viewed half an hour before clear and distinctOur guide was very earnest with us to quit the mountain as he prognosticated a storm was collecting and we should be in danger of being wet or in hazard of losing our way in the heavy vapour which he assured us would soon cover Skiddowthe circumstance was too sin∣gular to be left by people curious in their observations on natural events we de∣sired our guide would take care of him∣self and leave us to our pleasure but the good attendant had a due sense of our impropriety in wishing to be left there and determined to abide by us  The clouds advanced towards us with accelerated speeda hollow blast sound∣ed amongst the hills and dells which lay below us and seemed to fly from the approaching darknessthe vapour rol∣led down the opposite valley of Newland and appeared to tumble in mighty sheets and volumes from the brow of each mountain into the vale of Keswick and over the Lakes  Whilst we stood to admire this phe∣nomenon the mighty volumes of clouds which we beheld below us gradually as∣cended and we soon found the summit of Skiddow totally surrounded whilst we on every side looked down upon an angry and impetuous sea heaving its billows as if boiling from the bottom we were rejoicing in this grand spectacle of nature and thinking ourselves fortu∣nate in having beheld so extraordinary  an event when to our astonishment and confusion a violent burst of thunder en∣gendered in the vapour below us stunned our sense being repeated from every rock and down every dell in the most horrid uproar at the same time from the agitation of the air the mountain seemed to trembleat the time of the explosion the clouds were instantaneously illuminated and from innumerable chasms sent forth streams of lightningOur guide laid upon the earth terrified and amazed in his ejaculations accusing us of presumption and impietydanger made us solemn indeed we had no where to fly for safety no place to cover our heads to descend was to rush into the very inflammable vapour from whence our perils proceeded to stay was equally ha∣zardous for now the clouds which had received such a concussion by the thun∣der ascended higher and higher enve∣loping  the whole mountain and letting fall a heavy shower of rainwe thought ourselves happy even under this circum∣stance to perceive the storm turning northwestward and to hear the next thunderclap burst in the plain beyond Basnet waterA like event has frequent∣ly happened to travellers in the heights of the Alps from whence the thunder storms are seen passing over the countries beneath them  The echoes from the mountains which bordered Keswick Lake from Newland from Borodale from Lodore were noble and gave a repetition of the thunderclaps distinctly though distant after an intermission of several seconds tremendous silence  The rain which still encreased for∣med innumerable streams and cascades  which rushed from the crown of Skiddow Saddleback and Cawseypike with a mighty noise but we were deprived of the beauty of these waterfalls by the in∣tercepting vapour which was not to be penetrated by the eye more than a few yards before us  We descended the hill wet and fa∣tigued and were happy when we re∣gained our inn at Keswick which we now esteemed a paradise although we had despised it before for its dirtiness and inconvenience  We took leave of our slovenly and besotted host and pursued our rout from Keswick to AMBLESIDE a stage of eigh∣teen miles  For romantic mountainous and wild scenes this stage affords the finest  ride in the north of England the whole road lying in a narrow and winding dell confined by a stupendous range of moun∣tains on either handIn some places the vale is not wider than merely to admit the road in other places it opens in little valleys and again is shut in various formsWe passed near the rocks of ST JOHN's which on nearer view lost most of their grotesque appearance and as we winded by the feet of these lofty hills creeks filled with wood afforded us many pretty though narrow landskips through which little rills arising on the sides of the mountains poured down their hasty and gurgling watersThe rain which had fallen the day before improved the beauties of the placethe cascades were innumerable and their fi∣gures variousat one point of view we took in nine cascades falling from emi∣nences seven or eight hundred feet per∣pendicular  heightwhere some of them fell from the very brows of the hills they appeared as strings of silver but descend∣ing further spread into sheets of foam and before they reached the middle of the hills tumbled headlong from preci∣pice to precipice with a confused noise Every turn of the road and every val∣ley gave us a new scenethe prospects were ever changing and diversified  At length we reached a narrow Lake called LAYSWATER where the vale widenedscattered trees and some little inclosures adorned its margin and here and there a cottageWe rode by the side of this Lake for the distance of two miles so far it stretched along the vale on every hand enjoying little rural scenes which renewing to us a succession of pas∣toral images which we had collected from  the poets in our early years when the young mind was charmed with romance and the most fantastic ideas of rural in∣nocence retirement and love  Neither did these images pass in the imagination only for in this sequestered vale we met with a female native full of youth innocence and beautysimpli∣city adorned her looks with modesty and hid her downcast eye virgin apprehen∣sion covered her with blushes when she found herself stayed by two strangers and as she turned her eyes for an instant upon us they smote us with all the energy of unaffected innocence touched with doubtfulnessher lips which in the sweetest terms expressed her apprehen∣sion shewed us teeth of ivory and on her full forehead ringlets of auburn flowed carelessly a delicacy of proportion was  seen over her whole figure which was easy and elegant as nature's self  My companion in a rapture snatch∣ed out his pencil and began to imitate but the unaffected impatiency and sweet confusion of the maid overcame our wishes to detain her and we let her pass reluctantly  After this little adventure we jogged on silent and wraped up each in his own cogitations till we began to descend the hill towards the valley of GRASMERE we were roused by the unexpected beauties of the scene and as if moved by one thought we stopped gazed at each and smiled before we could condescend to snatch ourselves from the ideal pleasures we had been enjoyingWe were each conscious of our situation and at length  laughed aloud no otherwise communi∣cating our sentiments but by our looks which sufficiently explained our simpathe∣tic and silent delight  We were charmed with the view of GRASMERE a retirement surrounded by hills on every hand the vale is about four miles in circumference of meadow and pasture groundnear the middle of this valley is a fine Lake beautified with an islandFrom a mount a little distance from the church we viewed the whole cir∣cle delighted with the situationthe fields were full of freshness and verdure the scene was ornamented with a few humble cottages dispersed on the borders of the Lake amongst which the sacred fane stood solemnly superiorthe hills were here and there graced with a few  trees and animated by white flocks of sheepIt seemed to be the vale of peace  We had not passed far from this sweet sequestered scene before we entered RI∣DALE where we were again charmed with new retreats and happy retirements  Here we found a cultivated vale not equal in width to Grasmere but full of pretty inclosures and watered with a Lake on which a fine woody island arisesWe passed along the windings of this dale till we reached the seat of Sir Michael Flemingan ancient man∣sion standing on the opening of the dale on the southern decline of the hills which abound in wood land and front to the Lake of WINDERMEREThe ground before this seat is prettily diver∣sified with irregular knots of trees situate  on natural eminences and scattered with such agreeable wildness and irregularity that they seemed to be the work of na∣turethe interspaces between these knots of trees were mown in narrow meandring walks  Camden says  at the upper corner of Windermere lieth the dead carcase as one would say of an an∣tient city with great ruins of walls and many heaps of rubbish one from another remaining of buildings yet apparentThe fortress was oblong fenced with a ditch and rampart for it took up in length one hun∣dred and thirtytwo ells and in breadth eighty that it had been Roman work is evident by the British brick and mortar tempered with pieces of brick small earthen pots cruets or phials of glass by pieces of Roman money frequently found there by round stones like to millstones or quernstones of which they formed their columns and by the high roads leading to itNow the antient name is gone unless one should furmise that it were Amboglana of which the Book of Notices makes mention especially as the modern name is Ambleside  At the distance of half a mile opposite to the house are  lofty rocks and hanging woods of oak which form the channel of the river that feeds the Lake  AMBLESIDE is situate on the swift de∣cline of a hill over which many high mountains arise towards the northThe first appearance of our inn induced us to apprehend we should hasten our depar∣ture but the assiduous desire of pleasing shewn in the conduct of the people coun∣terbalanced their deficienciesHere we met with a gentleman Mr Penney of Penneybridge who was conversant with every curiosity in this country his polite and genteel behaviour rendered our stay at Ambleside very agreeableBy this gentleman's directions his servant con∣ducted us about a mile up the woody declivity of the hill behind the inn where we saw a most amazing cascade totally different from any thing we had  met with upon our tourMaking so great an ascent and not having reached a third of the height of this eminence it might be supposed that when we gained the view it would be something extraordinaryThe rushing of the wa∣ters in the fall sounded through the wood as we approached it and seemed at once as if it was bursting over our heads and tumbling beneath our feetthis was soon reconciled for in a few steps we perceived ourselves to be upon the sum∣mit of a cliff which overhung the chan∣nel of the stream where an old oak sus∣pended his romantic boughs over the precipicethis was the only opening of the wood or situation where we could look into this tremendous gulphThe river which falls here arises on the very height of the mountains and flows in a very confined channel through an open∣ing of rocks the edges of which were  grown with stately trees and thronged with thickets of hazel birch and holley We could look upwards from the place where we stood for about one hundred perpendicular yards where we saw the river in two streams pouring through the treesabout the midway it united and was again broken by a craggy rock grown with fern and brushwood which threw it into two branches foaming and making a horrid noise but it soon united again and from thence precipi∣tated into a deep and dreary gulph for above sixty yards below the cliff on which we stood from whence it tumbled from rock to rock and dashed through a rough and craggy channel down to the town of Ambleside with a mighty sound which shook the air so as to give a sensible agita∣tion to the nerves like the effect of a thunderclapthe whiteness of the fret∣ting waters was beautifully contrasted by  the black rocks which formed their pas∣sageIt was almost impossible for the steadiest eye to look upon this waterfall without giddinessIts beauties for a painter were noble and various the wood which hung upon the rocks over the stream was of mixed hues the trees projecting from each precipice knotty and grotesque the cliffs were black and fringed with ivy and fern which gave a singular lustre to the water∣fallNo fancy could exceed the happy assemblage of objects which rendered this view picturesque  The traces of Ambleside's antiquity are not now to be foundthe inhabitants have not preserved any of the Roman monu∣ments which were formerly discovered here  From Ambleside we went to BOWNAS a small village on the shore of the Lake of WINDERMERE this was a delightful ride lying within a little distance of the water which was opened to our view as we past through various turnings of the roadthe sides of the way are orna∣mented with woods meadows and pas∣ture ground  The owner of the White Lion Inn at Bownas has a boat on the Lake with which we were accommodated This Lake is very different from those we had seen in Cumberland being in length about twelve computed miles and not a mile in width in the broadest partthe hills seen around the Lake except those above Ambleside are humblethe mar∣gin of the water is irregular and indented and every where composed of cultivated  lands woods and pastures which de∣scend with an easy fall into the Lake forming a multitude of bays and pro∣montories and giving it the appearance of a large river in the narrowest parts not unlike to the Thames below Richmond On that part where Furness Fell forms the shore the scene is more rude and roman∣ticThe western side of this Lake is in Lancashire the eastern in Westmoreland  As we sailed down the Lake from Bownas we had two views which com∣prehended all its beautieswe rested upon the oars in a situation where look∣ing down the Lake we took into the pro∣spect the greatest extent of waterthe shore was indented by woody promon∣tories which shot into the Lake on each side to a considerable distanceto the right were the hills of Furness Fell which are the highest that arise immediately from  the water consisting chiefly of rocks which though not rugged and deformed have their peculiar beauty being scatter∣ed over with trees and shrubs each of which grows separate and distantthe brow of this rock overlooks a pretty penisula on which the ferryboathouse stands concealing its white front in a grove of sycamoresWhilst we were looking on it the boat was upon its way with several horse passengers which greatly graced the sceneto the left a small island of a circular form layed covered with a thicket of ash and birch wood beyond which the hills that arose from the Lake in gentle ascents to the right were covered with rich herbage and irregular groveson the left side of the Lake inclosures of meadow sweeping gently a way from the water lay bound∣ed by a vast tract of woods and over∣topped  with hills of moorish ground and heaththe most distant heights which formed the back ground were fringed with groves over which they lifted their brown eminences in various shapes  Upwards on the Lake we looked on a large island of about thirty acres of meagre pasture ground in an irregular oblong figure here and there some misshapen oak trees bend their crooked branches on the sandy brinks and one little grove of sycamores shelters a cottage The few natural beauties of this island are wounded and distorted by some ugly rows of firs set in right lines and by the works now carrying on by Mr English the proprietor who is laying out gardens on a square plan building fruit walls and preparing to erect a mansionhouse thereThe want of taste is a misfortune  too often attending the opulentthe ro∣mantic scite of this place on so noble a Lake and surrounded with such scenes asked for the finest imagination to have designed the plan of an edifice and pleasure groundsbut instead of that to see a Dutch Burgomaster's palace arise on this place to see a cabbage garth extend its bosom to the east squared and cut out at right angles is so offensive to the eye of the traveller that he turns away with disgustFor pleasure or for ornament a narrow foot path is cut round the mar∣gin of the island and laid with white sand resembling the dusty paths of foot pas∣sengers over Stepney fields or the way along which the owner often has heyed to Hackney  I would overlook this misshapen object whilst I viewed the Lake upwards with its evironsthe beautiful crags of Fur∣ness  Fell over which trees are dispersed in an agreeable wildness form the front ground on the left and by their projec∣tion cover the hills which are further ad∣vanced towards the head of the Lake which makes a curve bearing from the eyethree small woody islands of a fine circular figure and swelling to a crown in their centres arise from out the Lake with the deep verdure of their trees giving an agreeable teint to the azure hue the water received from re∣flection of the serene sky aboveover an expanse of water of the length of six miles and near a mile in breadth shining and bright as a mirror we view∣ed the agreeable variety of the adjacent countryto the right wood lands and meadows in many little peninsulas and promontories descended with easy slopes to the brink of the Lake where we view∣ed Bownas church and its cottages  arising above the trees beyond which laid the seat of Fletcher Fleming  Esq  situate on the brink of the Lake and covered on every side with rich wood land further were cots and villages disper∣sed on the rising groundin the front stood Ambleside and at the opening of the deep vale of Rydale the house of Sir Michael Fleming shielded on either hand by a wing of hanging forests climbing up the steeps of the mountainsThe nearest back ground to the right is com∣posed of an eminence called ORREST∣HEAD rising gradually to a point and cultivated to its crown which sweet mount is contrasted by the vicinage of the crags of BISCOTHOE which overtop the extensive wood lands of Mr Fleming then TROUTBECK PARKS arise where the hills begin to encrease in magnitude and form the range of mountains which are extended to Keswick diversified with  pasturage dells and cliffs looking over which LANGDON PIKES three mountains rising in perfect cones extend their heads surmounted only by the rocky and bar∣ren brow of KIRSTONE FELL whose cliffs overlook the whole  The Lake of WINDERMERE differs very much from those of HULLSWATER and KESWICKhere almost every ob∣ject in view on the whole Lake confesses cultivationthe islands are numerous but small and woody and rather bear a resemblance to the artificial circles raised on gentlemen's ponds for their swansThe great island is little better than a bank of sand but is now under the spoiling hand of a deformerThe innumerable pro∣montories are composed of fine meadow ground and ranges of treesthe hills except Furness Fell and those above  Ambleside are tame and on every hand a vast expanse of wood land is stretched upon the viewThe painters of POUSIN describe the nobleness of HULLSWATER the works of SALVATOR ROSA express the romantic and rocky scenes of KES∣WICKand the tender and elegant touches of CLAUDE LORAINE and SMITH pencil forth the rich variety of WINDERMERE  The greatest depth of Windermere we were told was not more than forty fa∣thom the water abounds in pike trout char eels and perchThe Lake whilst we visited it was covered with the boats of fishing parties it being customary for the country people after their hay har∣vest to make their days of jubilee in that diversion  In the church of Bownas is a window  of painted glass which was preserved at the dissolution of Furness abbey and brought hitherthe present remains shew that it has contained very fine co∣louring in its former statethe arms of France and England quartered are well preserved at the top of the window The design is a crucifixion in figures as large as life by the hands feet and parts remaining it seems to have been of singular beautyOn the dexter side of the crucifixion is St George slaying the dragon on the sinister the Virgin Mary an uncouth assemblageBeneath are the figures of a knight and his lady kneeling before whom are a group of kneeling monks over whose heads are wrote W Hartley Tho Honson and other names by the breaking of the glass rendered not legible  Furness abbey was dedicated to St Mary to whom also Bownas is inscribed  We went from Windermere to Ken∣dal  Camden writes  that the southern part of this shire inclosed between the river Lone and Winder∣mere is said to be fruitful in the valleys but the fells are rough and full of stony ground with rocks which bear no kind of herbage it is called the ba∣rony of Kendale or Candale taking its name from the river Can which runs through it over a rocky channelOn the west bank of this river stands Ken∣dale a town of very great trade and resort formed by two large streets crossing each otherthis is a place famed for excellent cloathing and for its re∣markable industrythe inhabitants carry forward an extensive trade for woollen goods known in all parts of EnglandThey boast that this place hath given title to Barons and Earlstheir Barons were the offspring of John Talboys of whose race Wil∣liam by consent of King Henry the Second called himself William of Lancaster whose niece and heir married Gilbert the son of Roger Fits Raniford by  whose daughters after her son William was dead the inheritance descended to Peter Brus Lord of Skelton the second of that sirname and unto Wil∣liam Lindsay from whom by the mother's side as we learn out of the Leiger Book of Furnesse Abby Ingeham Lord of Coney in France traced his de∣scent by which Peter Brus's daughter the sister and heir of Peter Brus the third came this Baronie to the Rosses of Wreke and from them by right of inheri∣tance devolved upon the Parrs of whom Sir Wil∣liam Parr was made Lord Parr by King Henry the EighthAs for the castle the antient seat of these Lords standing over against the town through age and neglect it is falling to decayThere have been three Earls of Kendale John Duke of Bedford was advanced to that honor by his brother King Henry the FifthJohn Duke of Somersetand John de Foix of that most noble and honourable family of the Foix in France whom King Henry the Sixth for his faithful service in the French wars preferred to that dignity  the road lies chiefly over barren  and rocky hills without change or va∣riety to afford any pleasure to the travel∣ler Towards the right in the course of the way appeared two openings which  shewed to us a small bay of the sea but these without any degree of beauty  We descended to the town of Ken∣dal rejoiced to change the prospect from barrenness and waste to a rich cultivated vale and a town thronged with industri∣ous inhabitants busied in a prosperous manufactory  KENDAL stands on the side of a hill facing to the eastas we looked over the buildings from the heights which we were descending we had a view of the ruins of Kendal Castle seated on the crown of a fine eminence at the distance of half a mile from the town and sepa∣rated from it by the river Kan over which two stone bridges are thrown The castle is now totally in decay and scarce gives any idea by its present ap∣pearance  of its ancient strength and gran∣deurOn the front opposite to the town the remains of bastions are seen at the south east and north west corners whilst all behind consists of confused and ragged wallsThe whole has formed a square defended by a ditch  Above the town of Kendal immedi∣ately opposite to the castle is a mole of a very singular form called by the inhabi∣tants CASTLE LAW HILLAbove the town some rocks shew themselves of the height of seven fathom or near it on which a mount has been thrown up of gravel and earth of an exact circular form arising from the plane on the top of the rock near thirty feetat the front adjoining to the town is a spacious level on part of which a bowling green is now madeThe mole is defended by a deep ditch which extends itself from the brink  of the rocks and on the right and left the plane is fortified by an inferior mole or mount  This hill though it is much inferior to that de∣scribed near Peurith called Maybrough or Maleberge and differing from it in many circumstances such as the vallum of pebbles the surrounding groves and druidical pillar yet appeared to us to be one of the antient parle hills of which the learned Spelman gives us this de∣scription  Collis vallo plerum{que} munitus in loco campestri ne insidius exponatur ubi convenire olim solebant centuriae aut viciniae inculae ad lites inter se tractandas terminandas Scotis reor' grith hail {que} mons pacificationis cui asyli privilegia concedebantur  See Maybrough page    The crown of the great mole is flat and has been defended by a breast work of earth and a narrow ditch and from east to west a ditch is struck through the centreThe whole circumference of the crown is sixtyone pacesthe account given by the inhabitants of this place  is that it was cast up for battering the castlebut for this purpose there was no need of so laborious a work it being also much above the level of the castle opposite to which many natural eminen∣ces might serve for that end  We passed from Kendal to BARROW∣BRIDGE a single house situate in a very narrow deep valley hemmed in on every side by mountains covered with verdure a fine stream serpentines through the vale and here and there little cottages are dispersed with scanty inclosures of meadow ground over which hangs a narrow wood from the rising of the hillsshut in on every side this is a place calculated for the most solemn re∣tirementin winter the rays of the sun for several weeks do not touch the vale but only gild the mountains along whose sides the opposite land sends an ex∣tensive  shadow whose gradations are daily marked by the watchful eye of the peasant longing for returning vegetation  Here might the recluse enjoy the pleasures of solitude and sacrifice to vir∣tuehere might he avoid the sins of the world and commune with his own soul and whilst commenting on the won∣derous scene before him  Look through nature up to nature's God  Pope    We walked along the banks of the brook that murmured through the peb∣bleswe strayed over the little meads we sauntered in every grove charmed with the deepness of the retirement The pleasures of the scene were enhanced to me by my recollection of past felicity which I had enjoyed from an evening  ramble in these sequestered walksIdeas flowed upon my mind replete with de∣licate sentiments whilst images of a hap∣py complexion possest reflection and pre∣sented to me my family and my beloved infantsJoy and affection melted my whole soul and involuntary tears took the silent expression of my tenderness and transport  Lost in selfishness I have trespassed upon my reader and covered a page with impropriety I hope the digression may be pardoned  From hence we continued our rout to KIRBY STEPHEN near which place we visited the ruins of PENDRAGON CAS∣TLE  Camden says  among those hills that famous river Eden which Ptolemy called Huna arising in York∣shire where he flows in a narrow stream encreasing by degrees from various rivulets passeth by Pendragon Castle which hath nothing remaining from the wast∣ing hand of time but merely its name and an heap of ruins and thence flows by Wharton Hall the seat of the Barons Wharton of whom the first was Sir Thomas Wharton advanced to that dignity by King Henry the Eighth to whom succeeded his son of the same name and after him Philip then living  of which the remains of a square  tower only are left and that most pro∣bably of a modern date For this place was repaired after it had laid in ruins for near two centuries by the Countess of Pembroke about the time she had re∣stored BroughThe situation of this place being in a deep dell on every hand overlooked by mountains from whence it might be annoyed shews it never could be built as a place of strength but rather as a retreat and place of con∣cealment in times of dangerOpposite to this place on the other side of the dell is a small intrenchment fortified by a  ditch and vallum but of what date or people no account can be obtainedThe Prince Euter Pendragon is of doubtful existence but is said to have died by treachery and poison put in a well in the year five hundred and fifteen  We passed by the ancient seat of the Wharton family in WHARTON PARKS now in decayMelancholy reflections arise on such a view when the traveller must necessarily exclaim with a sigh  such are the effects of dissipation and vice  THE END
