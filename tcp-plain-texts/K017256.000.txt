the gods  Take only a smack of  The nectar we crack of  You'll find it is punch and no more  The ingredients they mingle  Are contraries single  So are ours they're the elements four  Then Bacchus for thou art the drunkard's protector  Issue instant a fiat  And let who dare deny it  That nectar's good punch and that good punch is nectar    Exeunt  SCENE II  The Skirts of a Country Town on one Side

Dreams nightly in bed  Of something here that burns and burns  And feels like sprouting horns  GRACE  Lord Sir don't take it so to heart  Was I as you are for my part  I'd let her go for one more

mortal race  Nor wish to change nor fate nor place  You must of good and ill have share  And nature's nature every where  Jup  Once on a time when men complain'd  They were with ills too tightly stain'd  I publish'd in a certain town  That each might lay his burden down  And take up that more to his mind  Some other mortals left behind  When soon to see the ways of men  Each begg'd to have his own again  Cho  Then be content c  Mars  I heard you once the tale relate  A son took up his dad's estate  But when the youngster had found out  The packet held old age the gout  The rheumatism

dropp'd her false teeth out  O'erwhelm'd with shame soon chang'd her lot  With the poor inmate of a cot  But when she found on a straw bed  She must repose and eat brown bread  Wear a plain coif and russet gown  She wanted false teeth and the town  CHORUS  Then be content c  FINIS
