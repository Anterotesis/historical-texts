 PASTORALS  BY ALEXANDER POPE  PRINTED BY G NICHOLSON AND CO Palacestreet Manchester Sold by T KNOTT No Lombardstreet  CHAMPANTE WHITROW Jewrystreet London  PASTORALS  I SPRING OR DAMON  TO SIR WILLIAM TRUMBALL  First in these fields I try the sylvan strains  Nor blush to sport on Windsor's blissful plains  Fair Thames flow gently from thy sacred spring  While on thy banks Sicilian muses sing  Let vernal airs through trembling osiers play  And Albion's cliffs resound the rural lay  You that too wise for pride too good for pow'r  Enjoy the glory to be great no more  And carrying with you all the world can boast  To all the world illustriously are lost  O let my Muse her slender reed inspire  Till in your native shades you tune the lyre  So when the nightingale to rest removes  The thrush may chant to the forsaken groves  But charm'd to silence listens while she sings  And all th' aërial audience clap their wings  Soon as the flocks shook off the nightly dews  Two swains whom love kept wakeful and the muse  Pour'd o'er the whitening vale their sleecy care  Fresh as the morn and as the season fair  The dawn now blushing on the mountain's side  Thus Daphnis spoke and Strephon thus reply'd  Daph  Hear how the birds every blooming spray  With joyous music wake the dawning day  Why sit we mute when early linnets sing  When warbling Philomel salutes the spring  Why sit we sad when Phosphor shines so slear  And lavish Nature paints the purple year  Streph  Sing then and Damon shall attend the strain  While yon' slow oxen turn'd the furrow'd plain  Here the bright crocus and blue vi'let glow  Here western winds on breathing roses blow  I'll stake yon' lamb that near the fountain plays  And from the brink his dancing shade surveys  Daph  And I this bowl where wanton ivy twines  And swelling clusters bend the curling vines  Four figures rising from the work appear  The various seasons of the rolling year  And what is that which binds the radiant sky  Where twelve fair signs in beauteous order ly  Dam  Then sing by turns by turns the Muses sing  Now hawthorns blossom now the daisies spring  Now leaves the trees and flow'rs adorn the ground  Begin the vales shall ev'ry note rebound  Streph  Inspire me Phoebus in my Delia's praise  With Waller's strains or Granville's moving lays  A milkwhite bull shall at your altars stand  That threats a fight and spurns the rising sand  Daph  O Love for Sylvia let me gain the prize  And make my tongue victorious as her eyes  No lambs or sheep for victims I'll impart  Thy victim Love shall be the shepherd's heart  Streph  Me gentle Delia beckons from the plain  Then hid in shades eludes her eager swain  But feigns a laugh to see me search around  And by that laugh the willing fair is found  Daph  The sprightly Sylvia trips along the green  She runs but hopes she does not run unseen  While a kind glance at her pursuer flies  How much at variance are her feet and eyes  Streph  O'er golden sands let rich Pactolus flow  And trees weep amber on the banks of Po  Blest Thames  s shores the brightest beauties yield  Feed here my lambs I'll seek no distant field  Daph  Celestial Venus haunts Idalia's groves  Diana Cynthus Ceres Hybla loves  If Windsor shades delights the matchless maid  Cynthus and Hybla yield to Windsor shade  Streph  All Nature mourns the skies relent in show'rs  Hush'd are the birds and clos'd the drooping flow'rs  If Delia smile the flow'rs begin to spring  The skies to brighten and the birds to sing  Daph  All Nature laughs the groves are fresh and fair  The sun's mild lustre warms the vital air  If Sylvia smiles new glories gild the shore  And vanquish'd Nature seems to charm no more  Streph  In spring the fields in autumn hills I love  At morn the plains at noon the shady grove  But Delia always absent from her sight  Nor plains at morn nor groves at noon delight  Daph  Sylvia's like autumn ripe yet mild as May  More bright than noon yet fresh as early day  E'en spring displeases when she shines not here  But bless'd with her 't is spring throughout the year  Streph  Say Daphnis say in what glad soil appears  A wond'rous tree that sacred Monarchs bears  Tell me but this and I'll disclaim the prize  And give the conquest to thy Sylvia's eyes  Daph  Nay tell me first in what more happy fields  The thistle springs to which the lily yields  And then a nobler prize I will resign  For Sylvia charming Sylvia shall be thine  Dam  Cease to contend for Daphnis I decree  The bowl to Strephon and the lamb to thee  Blest swains whose nymphs in ev'ry grace excel  Blest nymphs whose swains those graces sing so well  Now rise and haste to yonder woodbine bow'rs  A soft retreat from sudden vernal show'rs  The turf with rural dainties shall be crown'd  While op'ning blooms diffuse their sweets around  For see the gathering flocks to shelter tend  And from the Pleiads fruitful show'rs descend  II SUMMER OR ALEXIS  TO DR GARTH  A shepherd's boy he seeks no better name  Led forth his flocks along the silver Thame  Where dancing sunbeams on the waters play'd  And verdant alders form'd a quiv'ring shade  Soft as he mourn'd the streams forgot to flow  The flocks around a dumb compassion show  The Naïads wept in ev'ry wat'ry bow'r  And Jove consented in a silent show'r  Accept O Garth the Muse's early lays  That adds this wreath of ivy to thy bays  Hear what from love unpractis'd hearts endure  From love the sole disease thou canst not cure  Ye shady Beeches and ye cooling Streams  Defence from Phoebus' not from Cupid's beams  To you I mourn nor to the deaf I sing  The woods shall answer and their echo ring  The hills and rocks attend my doleful lay  Why art thou prouder and more hard than they  The bleating sheep with my complaints agree  They parch'd with heat and I inflam'd by thee  The sultry Sirius burns the thirsty plains  While in thy heart eternal Winter reigns  Where stray ye Muses in what lawn or grove  While your Alexis pines in hopeless love  In those fair fields where sacred Isis glides  Or else where Cam his winding vales divides  As in the crystal spring I view my face  Fresh rising blushes paint the wat'ry glass  But since those graces please thy eyes no more  I shun the fountains which I sought before  Once I was skill'd in ev'ry herb that grew  And ev'ry plant that drinks the morning dew  Ah wretched shepherd what avails thy art  To cure thy lambs but not to heal thy heart  Let other swains attend the rural care  Feed fairer flocks or richer fleeces sheer  But nigh yon' mountain let me tune my lays  Embrace my love and bind my brows with bays  That flute is mine which Colin's tuneful breath  Inspir'd when living and bequeath'd in death  He said Alexis take this pipe the same  That taught the groves my Rosalinda's name  But now the reeds shall hang on yonder tree  For ever silent since despis'd by thee  Oh were I made by some transforming power  The captive bird that sings within thy bow'r  Then might my voice thy list'ning ears employ  And I those kisses he receives enjoy  And yet my numbers please the rural throng  Rough satyrs dance and Pan applauds the song  The nymphs forsaking every cave and spring  Their early fruit and milkwhite turtles bring  Each am'rous nymph prefers her gifts in vain  On you their gifts are all bestow'd again  For you the swains the fairest flow'rs design  And in one garland all their beauties join  Accept the wreath which you deserve alone  In whom all beauties are compriz'd in one  See what delights in sylvan scenes appear  Descending gods have found Elysium here  In woods bright Venus with Adonis stray'd  And chaste Diana haunts the forestshade  Come lovely nymph and bless the silent hours  When swains from sheering seek their nightly bow'rs  When weary reapers quit the sultry field  And crown'd with corn their thanks to Ceres yield  This harmless grove no lurking viper hides  But in my breast the serpent Love abides  Here bees from blossoms sip the rosy dew  But your Alexis knows no sweets but you  Oh deign to visit our forsaken seats  The mossy fountains and the green retreats  Where'er you walk cool gales shall fan the glade  Trees where you sit shall croud into a shade  Where'er you tread the blushing flow'rs shall rise  And all things flourish where you turn your eyes  Oh how I long with you to pass my days  Invoke the Muses and resound your praise  Your praise the birds shall chant in ev'ry grove  And winds shall waft it to the pow'rs above  But would you sing and rival Orpheus' strain  The wond'ring forests soon should dance again  The moving mountains hear the pow'rful call  And headlong streams hang list'ning in their fall  But see the shepherds shun the noonday heat  The lowing herds to murm'ring brooks retreat  To closer shades the panting flocks remove  Ye Gods and is there no relief for love  But soon the sun with milder rays descends  To the cool ocean where his journey ends  On me Love's fiercer flames for ever prey  By night he scorches as he burns by day  III AUTUMN OR HYLAS AND AEGON  TO MR WYCHERLEY  Beneath the shade a spreading beech displays  Hylas and Aegon sung their rural lays  This mourn'd a faithless that an absent love  And Delia's name and Doris' fill'd the grove  Ye Mantuan Nymphs your sacred succour bring  Hylas and Aegon's rural lays I sing  Thou whom the Nine with Plautus' wit inspire  The art of Terence and Menander's fire  Whose sense instructs us and whose humour charms  Whose judgment sways us and whose spirit warms  Oh skill'd in Nature see the hearts of swains  Their artless passions and their tender pains  Now setting Phoebus shone serenely bright  And fleecy clouds were streak'd with purple light  When tuneful Hylas with melodious moan  Taught rocks to weep and made the mountains groan  Go gentle Gales and bear my sighs away  To Delia's ear the tender notes convey  As some sad turtle his lost love deplores  And with deep murmurs fills the sounding shores  Thus far from Delia to the winds I mourn  Alike unheard unpity'd and forlorn  Go gentle Gales and bear my sighs along  For her the feather'd quires neglect their song  For her the limes their pleasing shades deny  For her the liles hang their heads and die  Ye Flow'rs that droop forsaken by the spring  Ye Birds that left by summer cease to sing  Ye Trees that fade when autumnheats remove  Say is not absence death to those who love  Go gentle Gales and bear my sighs away  Curs'd be the fields that cause my Delia's stay  Fade ev'ry blossom wither ev'ry tree  Die ev'ry flow'r and perish all but she  What have I said Where'er my Delia flies  Let spring attend and sudden flow'rs arise  Let op'ning roses knotted oaks adorn  And liquid amber drop from ev'ry thorn  Go gentle Gales and bear my sighs along  The birds shall cease to tune their ev'ning song  The winds to breathe the waving woods to move  And streams to murmur ere I cease to love  Not bubbling fountains to the thirsty swain  Not balmy sleep to lab'rers faint with pain  Not show'rs to larks or sunshine to the bee  Are half so charming as thy sight to me  Go gentle Gales and bear my sighs away  Come Delia come ah why this long delay  Through rocks and caves the name of Delia sounds  Delia each cave and echoing rock rebounds  Ye Pow'rs what pleasing frenzy soothes my mind  Do lovers dream or is my Delia kind  She comes my Delia comesNow cease my lay  And cease ye Gales to bear my sighs away  Next Aegon sung while Windsor groves admir'd  Rehearse ye Muses what yourselves inspir'd  Resound ye Hills resound my mournful strain  Of perjur'd Doris dying I complain  Here where the mountains less'ning as they rise  Lose the low vales and steal into the skies  While lab'ring oxen spent with toil and heat  In their loose traces from the field retreat  While curling smoaks from villagetops are seen  And the fleet shades glide e'er the dusky green  Resound ye Hills resound my mournful lay  Beneath yon' poplar oft' we pass'd the da    Oft' on the rind I carv'd her am'rous vows  While she with garlands hung the bending boughs  The garlands fade the vows are worn away  So dies her love and so my hopes decay  Resound ye Hills resound my mournful strain  Now bright Arcturus glads the teeming grain  Now golden fruits on loaded branches shine  And grateful clusters swell with floods of wine  Now blushing berries paint the yellow grove  Just Gods shall all things yield returns but love  Resound ye Hills resound my mournful lay  The shepherds cry "The flocks are left a prey"  Ah what avails it me the flocks to keep  Who lost my heart while I preserv'd my sheep  Pan came and ask'd What magic caus'd my smart  Or what ill eyes malignant glances dart  What eyes but her's alas have pow'r to move  And is there magic but what dwells in love  Resound ye Hills resound my mournful strains  I'll fly from shepherds flocks and flow'ry plains  From shepherds flocks and plains I may remove  Forsake mankind and all the worldbut Love  I know thee Love on foreign mountains bred  Wolves gave thee suck and savage tygers fed  Thou wert from Aetna's burning entrails torn  Got by fierce whirlwinds and in thunder born  Resound ye Hills resound my mournful lay  Farewell ye Woods adieu the light of day  One leap from yonder cliff shall end my pains  No more ye Hills no more resound my strains  Thus sung the shepherds till th' approach of night  The skies yet blushing with departing light  When falling dews with spangles deck'd the glade  And the low sun had lengthen'd ev'ry shade  IV WINTER OR DAPHNE  TO THE MEMORY OF MRS TEMPEST  Lycidas  Thyrsis the music of that murm'ring spring  Is not so mournful as the strains you sing  Nor rivers winding through the vales below  So sweetly warble or so smoothly flow  Now sleeping flocks on their soft fleeces ly  The moon serene in glory mounts the sky  Whilst silent birds forget their tuneful lays  Oh sing of Daphne's fate and Daphne's praise  Thyr  Behold the groves that shine with silver frost  Their beauty wither'd and their verdure lost  Here shall I try the sweet Alexis' strain  That call'd the list'ning Dryads to the plain  Thames heard the numbers as he flow'd along  And bade his willows learn the moving song  Lyc  So may kind rains their vital moisture yield  And swell the future harvest of the field  Begin this charge the dying Daphne gave  And said "Ye shepherds sing around my grave"  Sing while beside the shaded tomb I mourn  And with fresh bays her rural shrine adorn  Thyr  Ye gentle Muses leave your crystal spring  Let nymphs and sylvans cypress garlands bring  Ye weeping Loves the stream with myrtles hide  And break your bows as when Adonis dy'd  And with your golden darts now useless grown  Inscribe a verse on this relenting stone  " Let nature change let heav'n and earth deplore  " Fair Daphne's dead and love is now no more"  'T is done and Nature's various charms decay  See gloomy clouds obscure the cheerful day  Now hung with pearls the dropping trees appear  Their faded honours scatter'd on her bier  See where on earth the flow'ry glories ly  With her they flourish'd and with her they die  Ah what avail the beauties Nature wore  Fair Daphne's dead and beauty is no more  For her the flocks refuse their verdant food  The thirsty heifers shun the gliding flood  The silver swans her hapless fate bemoan  In notes more sad than when they sing their own  In hollow caves sweet Echo silent lies  Silent or only to her name replies  Her name with pleasure once she taught the shore  Now Daphne's dead and pleasure is no more  No grateful dews descend from ev'ning skies  Nor morning odours from the flow'rs arise  No rich perfumes refresh the fruitful field  Nor fragrant herbs their native incense yield  The balmy zephyrs silent since her death  Lament the ceasing of a sweeter breath  Th' industrious bees neglect their golden store  Fair Daphne's dead and sweetness is no more  No more the mounting larks while Daphne sings  Shall list'ning in mid air suspend their wings  No more the birds shall imitate her lays  Or hush'd with wonder hearken from the sprays  No more the streams their murmurs shall forbear  A sweeter music than their own to hear  But tell the reeds and tell the vocal shore  Fair Daphne's dead and music is no more  Her fate is whisper'd by the gentle breeze  And told in sighs to all the trembling trees  The trembling trees in ev'ry plain and wood  Her fate remurmur to the silver flood  The silver flood so lately calm appears  Swell'd with new passion and o'erflows with tears  The winds and trees and floods her death deplore  Daphne our grief our glory now no more  But see where Daphne wond'ring mounts on high  Above the clouds above the starry sky  Eternal beauties grace the shining scene  Fields ever fresh and groves for ever green  There while you rest in amaranthine bow'rs  Or from those meads select unfading flow'rs  Behold us kindly who your name implore  Daphne our goddess and our grief no more  Lyc  How all things listen while thy Muse complains  Such silence waits on Philomela's strains  In some still ev'ning when the whisp'ring breeze  Pants on the leaves and dies upon the trees  To thee bright Goddess oft' a lamb shall bleed  If teeming ewes increase my fleecy breed  While plants their shade or flow'rs their odours give  Thy name thy honour and thy praise shall live  Thyr  But see Orion sheds unwholsome dews  Arise the pines a noxious shade diffuse  Sharp Boreas blows and Nature feels decay  Time conquers all and we must Time obey  Adieu ye Vales ye Mountains Streams and Groves  Adieu ye Shepherds' rural Lays and Loves  Adieu my Flocks farewell ye Sylvan Crew  Daphne farewell and all the World adieu
