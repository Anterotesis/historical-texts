 A BRIEF VIEW OF THE FIGURES AND EXPLICATION OF THE METAPHORS CONTAINED IN SCRIPTURE  BY JOHN BROWN Minister of the Gospel at  Haddington  John v  Search the Scriptures  Hos xii  I have used  SIMILITUDES  by the ministry of the prophets  EDINBURGH PRINTED BY AND FOR GAVIN ALSTON MDCCLXXXII  THE PREFACE  THE advantage of a clear comprehensive and regular view of the  FIGURES  the  TYPES  and the  PREDICTIONS  of scripture is obvious In the  FIRST  we observe the surprising eloquence of Heaven and discern almost every form in nature a guide to and an illustrator of inspired truth By the  SECOND  we perceive the whole substance of the gospel of Christ truly exhibited in ancient shadows persons and thingsin laws apparently carnal and trifling In the  THIRD  we observe how astonishingly inspired predictions properly arranged and compared with the history of nations and churches do illustrate each other and modern events as with the evidence of miracles confirm our faith in the oracles of God The usefulness of what I have attempted with respect to all the  THREE  must be lest to the providence of God  The subsequent  MEDITATIONS  relate to the  FIGURES  of sacred writ To avoid too peremptory parallels and to awaken devotion they are cast into the present form The  EMBLEMS  the signification of which appeared uncertain or DIVersified are repeated under different heads To shun interfering with  TYPES  many rich  EMBLEMS  as of  ZION PRIESTS c  are wholly omitted or but slightly touched To shun a tiresome length and a sinking dulness that which was just before hinted on a similar  EMBLEM  is not seldom passed over and the history of  EMBLEMS  is lest to be collected from the account of the  OBJECTS  which they represent nor on  THIS  are ought but hints offered and the enlargement is left to the reader's own meditation What friendly indulgence is requisite to pardon mistakes the peruser must judge Meanwhile it is hoped he will remember that the espial of faults is much easier work than to avoid them  The CONTENTS  BOOK I  A general view of the FIGURES of scripture language  p    BOOK II  Explication of METAPHORS respecting PERSONS  viz  God

and EXPLICATION of METAPHORS CONTAINED IN SCRIPTURE  BOOK I  SCRIPTURElanguage in general  IN the manner of the East the language of inspiration abounds with the most striking and instructive figures In noble and candid simplicityin bold allusion not all the writings of men can vie with these oracles of God Hereas one would expect in the idiom of Godhead the principal truths are brought down to the weakest capacity that ignorance may have nothing to plead for excuse others chiefly predictions are often wrapped up in figures obscure and hard to be understood Thus till the fulfilment the learned are forced to acknowledge their ignorance and malicious opposers rendered incapable to stop the predicted event  The figures of sacred language are either SIMPLE or COMPLEX The former without changing the native sense of the words embellish the stile enliven the representation or illustrate the subject the latter while they ennoble the stile and illustrate the subject do also convert the terms from their ordinary signification to another connected with it  Simple figures are A REPETITION of the same term or phrase whether in the same or in different sentences  of a chapter or section as of MY Psal xviii  my  God Psal xxii and cxviii  my help  Psal cxxi  whatsoever things are  Phil iv  his mercy endureth for ever  Psal cxxxvi  Lord our Lord  c Psal viii DIVERSIFYING of the sense while the sound is nearly retained Thus  Walk in the flesh  and  war after the flesh  agree pretty much in found but differ vastly in sense CHANGING of the sense of a word in the same sentence Thus  good  in Matth xix signifies first what is  good  and useful in a limited sense and then what is infinitely and originally  good fruit of the vine  Matth xxvi both signifies natural wine and eternal happiness CONFORMATION of the sound of the terms to the mournful the joyful the terrible deterstable or amiable nature of the subject Thus the portion of the wicked is described in words sounding forth terror Psal xi the last day in most dreadful language Pet iii OUTCRIES of admiration abhorrence derision commendation wishing pity joy grief as  How great is his goodness  Zech ix  O wretched man that I am  c Rom vii  O woman great is thy saith  Matth xv CORRECTIONS of what was just before asserted as  Yet not I but Christ liveth in me  Gal ii  Yet not I but the grace of God  Cor xv In promises the reward and especially that which is terrible in a threatening complaint or oath is sometimes partly SUPPRESSED as  He shall be chief ana captain  Sam v  I will drive him out  Gen iii  Wilt thou cast me off  Psal vi  Let me cease to exist  if I lie Psal lxxxix Interrupting ADDRESSES as of Nehemiah to God chap iv of God by Joel to the Hebrews chap ii of David to the mountains of Gilboa to the daughters of Israel to Jonathan Sam i INTRODUCTION of speeches real or feigned as of the chosen ruler of Judah Is iii of their women Is iv of the firtrees and of the dead Is xiv of hell and destruction Job xxviii When these speeches are wicked they are sometimes expressed not as uttered by the author but as they truly meant Thus sinful  means of relief are called  a covenant with hell and agreement with death  Is xxviii flattering prophecies are called  deceits  Is xxx false witnesses are called  sons of Belial  Kings xxi QUESTIONS expressive of absurdity wonder doubt demonstration expostulation anger insult grief negation pity desire refusal prohibition as  How can a man be born when he is old  John iii  How excellent is thy loving kindness  Psal xxxvi  Shall Sarah that is ninety years old bear  Gen xvii  Is anything too hard for the Lord  Gen xviii  c  APPEALS to those who are argued against as of the apostles to the Jewish rulers Acts iv of Paul to the Galatians chap iii RETORTION or throwing back an accusation or objection on the starter of it So God throws back the charge of  injustice  on the Jews who charged him with it Ezek xviii the Syrophenician woman pleads the character of a  dog  thrown out against heras an argument for mercy Matth xv To repel the question By what authority he acted Jesus posed the inquirers  Whether the baptism of John was from heaven or of men  Matth xxi PREVENTION of objections by answering them before they be started Thus the objection of God's deserting his church is prevented Is xlix An apparent YIELDING of that which an opposer pleads in order to shew its absurdity or its insufficiency to establish the point in dispute So Paul grants the Jews to have great knowledge of the law and a capacity to instruct othersin order to shew them how their sin in breaking the law was aggravated Rom ii James grants the ungodly professor that he  had faith  but shews that the devils also  believed and trembled  Jam ii ASSIGNATION of the reason of an action or name Thus Paul was not ashamed of the gospel because it was  the power of God for salvation to believers  and it was so because  therein the righteousness of God was revealed  Rom i The law silenceth and condemns all men because  by it is the knowledge of sin  and therefore  by the deeds of it shall no flesh be justified  Rom iii No man can be saved by the law  because it worketh wrath  in our corrupt nature against  God and condemns us to his just wrath Rom iv Lively DESCRIPTIONS which as it were present the objects to our eyes and other senses as of Tophet Is xxx of Goliah Sam xvii of God's compassion Jer xxxi Hos xi DIGRESSIONS in which the speaker for a time turns aside from his immediate subjects and descants upon an object occasionally mentioned Thus the apostles often turn aside to discourse concerning Jesus Christ as Rev i Col i TRANSITIONS in which one part of the sentence respects that which went before and another what follows Thus  Covet earnestly the best gifts  respects what precedes and  I shew you a more excellent way  that which follows Cor xii CONTRASTS in which subjects dissimilar are compared in order to mark clearly the nature value or unworthiness of the one so the condition of the wicked is contrasted with that of the righteous Psal i God's kindness and mens unfruitfulness and wickedness are contrasted Is v Men and the Holy Ghost are contrasted Acts v COMPARISON of things like or unlike in order to argue from the one to the other Thus Christ argues from the lesser to the greater Matth vi and vii and that God is to feared rather than men Matth x INDUCTION by which compound things are represented in their various parts And here there is generally an ascending as to the object or the language Thus the desolation of a country is described from the case of the fields the inhabitants people priest servant master seller buyer  c  Is xxiv God's just judgment is represented in his rewarding the righteous and punishing the wicked Rom ii The resurrection is described as partly to happiness and partly to damnation John v Christ's state is described from the debased and exalted circumstances of it Phil i Thus the sin or the judgment of men is often described in a variety of particulars Ezek xxii and xxiii CROWDING of various qualities or things into one sentence as of sacrifices rams bullocks lambs hegoats vain oblations new moons sabbaths assemblies Is i of  foreknowledge predestination calling justificati  n glorification Rom viii REDOUBL  D REPRESENTATIONS in which objects are represent  d first more obscurely and then more plainly as  Har the right attend to my cry give car to my prayer  Psal xvii  Water  and the  Spirit  John iii  Thy silver is become dross thy wine is mixt with water  thy  princes are rebellious and companions of thieves  Is i CIRCUMLOCUTIONS in which for modesty or to sweeten or heighten the language the proper name of an object is avoided and an indirect description is given in its stead So a chamberpot is called a  vessel wherein there is no pleasure  Jer xxii Urine is called the  waters of the feet  Kings xviii Heb Death is called  the king of terrors  Job xviii REFERENCES in which the words or sense of another speaker or writer are quoted or alluded to Here the words are sometimes quoted in a sense which they did not originally seem to bear and sometimes the terms or the sense of DIVers passages are conjunctly quoted into oneQuotations or allusions abound in the New Testament Matth i and xxi Acts vii  c c  concerning which many excellent observations may be found in Carpzow's  Defence of the Bible  Complex figures are metonymy synecdoche meiosis hyperbole irony metaphor  By METONYMY the name of  one object  is given to  another  because of some  connection  not  similitude  betwixt them Thus The name of the matter the author the cause or instrument is given to that which is produced from or by it or the name of the effect is given to the author cause or instrument Thus the wood in the houses and furniture of Jerusalem is called a  forest  Jer xxi Ezek xx the temple for its plenty of cedarwood that grew in Lebanon is called  Lebanon  Zech xi a heavenly frame is called  the Spirit  Rev i the name of a father as of Jacob Moab  c  is given to his posterity Is xliii and xvi a testimony is called the  mouth  Deut xvii speech is called the  tongue  Prov xxv the benefits God bestows are called his  love  John  iii Contrariwise Christ is called  salvation  because he is the author of it Gen xlix Esau's taking Canaanitish wives is called a  grief i e  a cause of grief Gen xxvi the gospel is called  the power of God i e  the instrument of exerting it Rom i victory over the world is called  faith  as faith obtains it John v the transgression of Israel is called  Samaria  and the highplaces of Judah  Jerusalem  because these cities chiefly promoted wickedness and idolatry Mic i wisdom and knowledge are called  stability  because they are the means of it Is xxxiii The name of a subject is given to its adjunct and of an adjunct to its subject Thus a city a country the earth the world is put for the inhabitants of it Jer iv Gen vi a cup for that which is contained in it Cor xi  This cup  c Psal xxxiii a nest for the pullets in it Deut xxii the heart for the desires or other things contained in it Psal lxii  Pour out your hearts  The name of a possessor is given to what is possessed so Christ's people are called himself Matth xxv Acts ix Cor xii so  the Lord i e  what offerings belonged to him is called Levi's inheritance Deut x The name of the thing signified is given to the sign so the wine in the Lord's supper is called  Christ's blood  or the  New Testament in it  Matth xxvi and of the sign to the thing signified the sovereign rule is called a  sceptre  Gen xlix The name of the quality is given to its subject so a scarlet and crimson coloured thing is called  scarlet  and  crimson  Is i The name of that which is contained is given to that which contains it so fields are called  the upper and nether springs  Josh xv Names are put for the person or thing named so the  name  of Christ or of God often signifies precisely  Christ  or  God  himself Acts iv Deut xxviii Persons and things are named according to appearance not reality so angels are called  men  Gen xviii Satan is called  Samuel  Sam xxviii error is called a  gospel  Gal i ▪  By SYNCEDOCHE More universal terms are put for such as are more restricted as ALL for  many  for all kinds for the greater or better part Matth iii  and xix  the world  for the Roman empire the Gentiles the wicked the Antichristians Luke ii John ii and v Rev xiii  every creature  for men Mark xvi or the plural number for the singular as  children  for child Gen xxi More restricted terms are put for such as are more extensive as  one  for all of the kind Psal i  yesterday  for time past Heb xiii a limited number as  thrice seven  or ten  times  for frequently Cor xii Psal cxix a  thousand five thousand  for an uncertain number Is xxx A whole person thing place or time is put for an adjunct or part of it So Christ is said to die to be buried when only his body died and was buried John xix and ii  world  is put for  Canaan  Rom iv  north  for  Caldea  Jer i  for ever  for a  long  time Dan ii A part of a person thing place or time is put for the whole of it So  souls  denote human persons Acts ii  resurrection  is put for Christ's whole appearance in our nature Acts i  hour  for a period of time John iv  By MEIOSIS a great deal less is expressed than is really signified Thus in the negative precepts much more is intended than is literally expressed Exod xx  By HYPERBOLE things are represented as far more insignificant great glorious or numerous than they really are So the Hebrew spies are represented as  grasshoppers  Numb xiii the top of a tower or wall is said  to reach to heaven  Gen xi Deut xi the histories of all Christ's works could not be  contained  rather  perused  by the  world  John xxi the Israelites are represented as in number  like to the sand on the sea shore or dust of the earth  Gen xiii and xxii so contentions are called  wars  Jam iv plenty of milk honey and butter or oil is represented as  rivers of it  Job xxix Saul and Jonathan are represented as  swifter than eagles  and  stronger than lions  Sam i The terms of this figure must al+ways be understood with due limitation  By IRONY words are uttered with such an air or other circumstance as makes them bear a signification  quite contrary to their common one as  Let them  the false gods  rise up and help you  Deut xxxii  Bless God and die  Job ii  Rejoice O young man  c Eccl xi  Sleep on now  c Matth xxvi  Cry aloud for he is a God  c Kings xviii  Go up and prosper for the Lord shall deliver it  c Kings xxii When the irony is extremely sharp and reproachful it is called a  sarcasm  as  a goodly price  c Zech xi  How glorious was the King of Israel to day  Sam vi  He trusted in God  Psal xxii  By METAPHOR the names qualities and actions proper to some persons or things are ascribed to other persons or things because of some  likeness  between them These of rational beings are ascribed to other rational beings so Satan is called a  god  ministers  angels  c Those of inanimate things to other inanimate things so God's purpose or gospel is called a  foundation  c These of living creatures to things without life so the creation is said to  groan  to  travail  to  will  c Those of things without life to such as have it so Christ is called a  way  a  door  the  truth  cThat by comparing the volumes of nature with the oracles of God we may be alway and everywhere surrounded with spiritual monitors No figure is more frequent than this nor is there almost any thing in nature from which it is not drawn Particularly From RATIONAL BEINGS as  God holy

things from which the metaphor is drawn and that to which it is applied When this likeness is exhibited in one or a few expressions it is a SIMPLE METAPHOR When it is pursued with a variety of expressions or there is a continued assemblage of metaphors it is called an ALLEGORY When the resemblance is harsh and far fetched as to  set a voice  it is a CATACHRESIS When it is couched in a short saying obscure and ambiguous it is called a RIDDLE When it is couched in a short saying commonly used it is termed a PROVERB When the metaphoric representation is delivered in form of a history it is a PARABLE Because every thing has various qualities and operations one thing may be the metaphorical emblem of persons or things different or contrary so a LION is the emblem of God of Christ of Satan and of men good and bad The difference between the emblem and the object of the metaphor that is between that from which the metaphor is drawn and that which it exhibits renders it impossible for any metaphor fully to represent its object and absurd to expect that an universal similitude betwixt the emblem and the object should ever be found Hence it sollows that to squeeze metaphors by running the parallel further than truth and decency with respect to the emblem and object will admit is not to illustrate but to discredit and darken the mysteries of God Nay in the sacred metaphors one particular is generally the  principal  thing thereby exhibited THIS by the attentive reader or preacher should from the circumstances of the text or context be especially enquired after and considered  BOOK II  Metaphors representing Persons  CHAP I▪  Metaphors respecting God  GOD is compared to a MAN because of his wisdom and prudence his manifold excellency his extensive sovereignty

Ambassador of peace weep bitterly  if by tears by groans by blood by death he beseech me to be reconciled unto God O my foul beware of him obey his voice provoke him not he will not pardon my wilful my final transgressions for my Father's name is in him  Christ is a JUDGE  John v Tim iv  In his Father's name and authority he with unlimited wisdom impartial equity almighty power and undaunted courage maintains the honour of the DIVine law and the peace and order of his subjects By passing and executing proper and seasonable sentences he renders himself infinitely terrible to offenders It is his to recognize every man's deeds and  to reward or revenge as they are good or bad Now every conscience every church ruler is deputy under him At the last day every man every apostate angel shall be publicly fisted at his decisive tribunal By the testimony of God and of their conscience shall he fully evince and openly shall he declare what they have been or done According to his righteous law shall he pronounce and execute their sentence dismissing the wicked  into everlasting punishment  but  the righteous into life eternal  Meditate terror ye obstinate transgressors "behold he cometh with clouds every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him all the  wicked  kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him  Now now  is the accepted time  now  is the day of salvation"  now  embrace him as your offered your allsufficient Saviour so shall ye be for ever delivered from him as your angry Judge If you neglect this how shall you "abide the day of his coming in flaming fire to take vengeance on all them that know not God and who obey not the gospel" Lift up thine head my foul none else is judge but Christ  Will he  who bare my sins  plead against me  in judgment "No but he will put strength in me I know in whom I have believed and that he is able to keep that  salvation of my soul  which I have committed to him against that day"  Christ is an ADVOCATE  John ii

friends with the prey It is thine O Jesus with  the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God  with the gospel  arrows  of deep conviction of saving illumination and heartmelting influence to subdue thy people and make them  willing in the day  of thy  power  It is thine to cause them enlist under they banner and take hold of thy covenantThine to teach their  hands to war  and their  fingers to fight  with principalities powers and spiritual wickedness in high places and to  mortify the deeds of the body  and  crucify the flesh  that they may liveThine to array them with the

 everlasling salvation  and to punish with unsupportable ruin such as refuse thy terms of peace or decline to enlist in thy bandsIn all my spiritual warfare let me set the Lord continually before me  let me stand still and see his salvation "and follow after him only to spoil"  Christ is a LEADER and GUIDE  If lv  By his DIVine providence he directs all things In the wilderness of a natural state and of a present evil world he meets with his chosen In their regeneration he converts them from the error of their way makes them to enter in at the strait gate and brings them into himself the way that leadeth unto life He abides with comforts assists goes before and shews a pattern to them and by his word and Spirit directs them in every case till they enter into the joy of their Lord Rejoice

 Acts iii John iii  In consequence of DIVine appointment and furniture for his work he by his word and Spirit faithfully and infallibly reveals to men his Father's will chiefly what relates to a future state and the way to it How unbounded and exact is his knowledge of the DIVine mind It is his to have "compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way" with astonishing patience and care freely to teach them the mysteries of the kingdom It is his to inform his people how to cleanse themselves from iniquity how to avert DIVine judgments how to war with their spiritual foes and to assure them of success therein It is his to solve all their doubts and speak a word in season to them that are weary It is his to confirm his mission with miracles obvious to the world and with

thousand  Acts iii John iii  To his children he explains the secrets of his covenant the mysteries of his word the deeps of his  Job xxxiii  nature person and purpose the wonders of his providence By him they are made to understand when and what the Lord speaks to them and taught to express the language of heaven in prayer praise and holy conferenceWhen O Jesus wilt thou privately explain every parable to me When wilt thou unteach me this Ashdodlike jargon of carnal and unknown words and turn to me a  pure language  O when shall this Babellike strife about words entirely cease in the church and world and men "serve the name of the Lord with one consent"  Christ is called  the faithful and true  WITNESS  Rev iii Is lv  Being DIVinely called he with the utmost fidelity and clearness declares to men the whole truth of God necessary to be known and nothing else Solemnly he confirmed it by his own and his prophets and apostles miracles almost innumerable Solemnly he confirmed it by his own suffering and death Solemnly he confirms it by his oath and sacraments by the testimony of his Spirit to mens conscience and by the attesting course of his providence in the world And according to thy declarations O Jesus shall we be judged at the last dayShall I reject the attested promises of GodMy soul dost thou now believe  Christ is called the APOSTLE or missionary  of our profession  Heb iii  Solemnly hath God called thee O Redeemer and wonderfully hath he qualified thee to make a clear complete and infailible revelation of his will to men as the standard and rule of their religious profession It is truly thine to confirm thy mission and doctrine with miracles benevolent great and many to confer the Holy Ghost by laying on of thy hands to be equally concerned with all the churches and to be properly succeeded by none in thy office It is thine to frame to found and order the gospelchurch and to be the author matter and end of our whole ChristianityMy soul

profession but real inward grace constitute any the sheep of his pasture He is called the  minister of the sanctuary  How near he approacheth to God intercedes in the holy place above and at last will for ever remain the only minister of the church He is called the  minister of the circumcision  In his debased state he preached to few but circumcised JewsAm I returned to this  shepherd and bishop of souls  Am I of the  true circumcision  who worship God in the spirit rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh  Christ is called a PRIEST  Heb iii and vii Rev viii Ezek x    Taken from among men  with respect to his humanity he is solemnly  called of God  and furnished with all necessary gifts and grace to give himself a sacrifice of infinite value to satisfy DIVine justice and reconcile us to God and to make continual intercession for us His  golden altar  is himself his own precious and DIVine nature The  much incense  wherewith he offers up the prayers of all saints to God is his own merits and intercession His "taking fire from the altar or from between the cherubims and casting it on the earth" imports that the contempt of his person and finished righteousness is the great cause of vengeance and he hath the management of all the fiery judgments of God sent upon apostate churches He is made  priest with an oath  for his encouragement and for our comfort and stedfastness in the faith of his righteousness and intercession God hath in the most solemn way ascertained the eternal duration of his priesthood He is a  priest of good things to come  his purchase

sacrifice and intercession are the whole sum and substance of the gospel He is a  great High priest  altogether unparallelled in the dignity of his person office and work  Christ is called the BREAKER  that is gone  UP  Mic ii  In the greatness of his wisdom and power he in the counsel of peace came UP and engaged for us In his incarnation he came UP and assumed our nature In his life and in his death he came UP and obeyed the law and satisfied the justice of God in our stead In his resurrection in his ascension he went UP and took possession of everlasting felicity in our name In his intercession he stands UP as our advocate to "appear in the presence of God for us" At last he will  break through  and come in the clouds Even now he  breaks through  and comes UP in the offer and application of his grace Having through manifold impassablelike paths  broken up  a  new and living way  to eternal happiness he  breaks  the head of Satan by destroying his power  breaks  off our chains of darkness removes our guilt and corruption brings us out of our spiritual prison of blindness and bondage By conviction and illumination he  breaks up  the fallowground of our heart By the almighty influence of his love he  breaks  the power of our emnity and rebellion With heavy chastisements he often  breaks  the spirits of his people And with unrelenting strokes and unceasing storms of wrath he  breaks to pieces  his incorrigible foesRejoice my soul for I shall  go up  and  pass through  and the Lord on my head Break all things as they will never shall I be broken off from him  Christ is compared to a MASTER and LORD  John xiii  With infinite expence tenderness skill and authority he erects his church and provides for her every thing necessary He instructs admonisheth and corrects his people assigns them their respective work and reward It is his to be heartily chosen highly feared loved honoured and served with faithfulness and singleness of heartLet me  call no man

the Father committed  all power in heaven and earth  and given him to be  head over all things to the church  Into  his hand is given all the fulness of grace and glory to be distributed by him to sinful men according to the manner prescribed in the purpose and covenant of God On him the happiness of creation chiefly of  his body the church  doth depend and to him we must apply in every  time of need  With infinite prudence with unspotted fidelity he manageth and dispenseth every thing committed to his charge In the end he will render to God an honourable account of it and be rewarded with everlasting glory and greatnessMy soul cast all thy "care upon him for he careth for thee" and will give thee thy portion in due season  Christ hath the KEY OF DAVID  Rev iii Is xx  i  He "openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth He hath the  key of knowledge  he knows all his people's persons cases and cares he understands the scriptures and appoints others to explain them He hath the  key of authority  and government in his church he fixeth ordinances bestows gifts and dispenseth blessings as he pleaseth Maugre all opposition he  opens  the scripture spreads the light and knowledge thereof he  opens  a door of opportunity to preach the gospel and gives ministers a  door of utterance  therein and  opens  the heart to receive the ingrafted word to the saving of the soul It is his to open the door of the church and admit his chosen sheep adding daily "such as shall be saved" It is his to  open  the door of heaven by his blood and bring his saints into that glorious place Notwithstanding every contrary attempt it is thine O Jesus to  shut  up the scripture and render it a sealed book to  shut  out the gospel by forbidding to preach it to  shut  the heart by giving it up to the power of its corruptions or having entered thyself to  shut  out thy rivals in hell or in earth and at last to  shut  the gates of happiness against thine obstinate despisers It is thine to  shut  up men in trouble spiritual or temporal and to relieve them therefrom at thy pleasure"O bring my soul out of prison that I may glorify thy name  Shut"  be my heart to every temptation to every vanity to every lust  Christ is compared to an HUSBANDMAN or master  of a field or vineyard  Luke xiii  With the inestimable price of his blood he purchased the field the vineyard of his church He hedgeth it about with discipline and government Every one in or about it he placeth in his proper station All his people chiefly his ministers he appoints to labour in and watch over it By convictions he digs and ploughs it By gospeloffers and gracious influences he fattens it With his full flood of DIVine doctrines and spiritual grace he waters it By cutting off unruly professors by death or by churchcensure by purging out unruly lusts and irregular practices by means of sanctified afflictions good laws and gracious influences he prunes and weeds it With infinite pleasure he reviews walks in watcheth over it and patiently waits for the fruit of it His ripe saints he cuts down transports them to his celestial barns and storehouse while he casts the wicked tares into  unquenchable fire  The chief honour of the whole management he claims for himself but allows a proportionate reward to his ministers his peopleBe thou my soul the vineyard of the Lord of hosts and be my graces his pleasant plants  Christ is compared to a SOWER  Matth xiii  With infinite care and skill he casts abroad the good seed of his word in the visible church Partly it falls upon inattentive sinners who like the  wayside  give it no reception not so much as into their memory and judgment part of it upon  stony ground  upon obdurate and hardhearted sinners who though at first somewhat affected quickly wither and return to their wonted unconcern part of it  among thorns  upon sinners under the power of carnal cares which choke and render it unfruitful part of it upon  good ground  upon renewed hearts which in different degrees bring forth abundant fruits of righteousness to the praise and glory of God After ploughing our heart by conviction and trouble it is thine O Jesus to cast into it the good seed of thy grace thine by repeated influence to water and harrow the soilJustly dost thou call and look for our  precious fruits  justly dost thou reckon thyself honoured when evangelical truths gracious influences and special providences  make us to abound in the work of the LordO thy longsuffering patience and kind waiting for our repentanceBut ah the vengeance that shall at last overtake such as are obstinate and barren Alas what tares of hypocrites Satan sows in thy church What tares of sinful inclinations and practices are in our heart and life But we look for a time when these dissemblers shall be utterly destroyedHasten my soul unto the coming of this day of God  Christ is compared to a SHEPHERD  Is xl Heb xiii  The Father hath appointed Him to oversee his people the flock of his pasture to seek and save them when lost In the wilderness of a natural state on the mountains of vanity and guilt he seeks them out follows after and apprehends them by the word and power of his grace with joy and gladness he lays them on the shoulder of his almighty love bears them into a new covenant state carries them through a present evil world and notwithstanding their weakness and frowardness bears them at last to his heavenly fold Exact O Saviour is thy knowledge of them in their persons their state and case It is thine to mark the sheep of thy outer pasture thy visible church with a semblance of sanctity and those of the inner the invisible church with thy real image and Spirit in the hidden man of their heart It is thine to feed them with knowledge and understanding upon the  green pastures  of thy person thy relations covenant righteousness and love It is thine to preserve them from the unwholesome pastures of false doctrine sinful corruption and carnal care It is thine to gather the weak lambs with thy arms and earry them in thy bosom and gently to lead those who are burdened in spirit and are  with young  concerned to convert others to thy way It is thine to gather thy chosen into the fold of the visible church and of intimate nearness to thyself In the scorching noon tide of persecution of temptation or of prevalent corruption it is thine to give them rest under the shadow of thy powerful protection and love to cause them lie down in the  green pastures  and beside the  still waters  of refreshful ordinances redeeming kindness and gracious influence  By exposing by giving thy life for them by applying thy righteousness and by exerting thy providence in their defence it is thine to shelter them from every storm to save them from every devourer and preserve them from destruction It is thine tenderly and with infinite exactness to observe their condition watch over and keep them that none may ever be lost It is thine to follow after and by power and love reduce them from every wanderingkindly to pluck them out of every fearful pit and miry clay and wash from their filthiness in the streams of thy blood thy Spirit It is thine to heal their grievous their unnumbered diseases to restore their soul when faint and lead them in a way that is right By churchcensure he now separates the infected with scandal that the rest be not partakers in their sins or their plagues at last he will fully separate the goats the unclean and present the residue before God  without spot or wrinkle or any such thing  The Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall for ever feed them in a good pasture he shall guide them unto fountains of living waterBless the Lord O my soul that he "brought again from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep" by the finished price of our redemption "the blood of the everlasting covenant"  Christ is compared to a PHYSICIAN  Matth  x ▪ Is lxi Exod iv  Him the Father hath sent sealed and furnished to heal our spiritual ailments Every man whose soul is affected with the blindness of ignorance the deafness of spiritual unconcern the fever of concupiscence the jaundice of malice the swelling tympany of pride the vertigo of inconstancy the quinzy of cursing and blasphemy the dropsy of covetousness the palsy of stupidity the p  eurisy of envy the rheumatism of discontent the delirium of constant levity the moonstruck madness of passion and rage or with legality unbelief hardness of heart the temptations of Satan the stings of conscience or any other plague hath full warrant to apply to him for a cure In the word of the everlasting gospel he exhibits his sign pul  isheth his all comprehending skill and the unfailing efficacy of his prescriptions He fully understands our distempers and their proper their infallible  remedy By day or night he is infinitely ready to visit the distressed how he rides on cherubs on wings of everlasting love to attend them O his infinite concern for the welfare of his patients All of them poor and needy he heals without money and without price How often while insensibility selfnaughtiness unbelieving fear and shame restrain us from calling him comes he of his own accord and saith to our soul  Wilt thou not be made whole  O the large assortment of his spiritual medicines contained in the promises of the new covenant When he applieth them how thoroughly he examines our case not that he but that we may know it How thoroughly he searcheth our wounds by convictions and trouble The poisonous morsels we had swallowed he makes us by penitent grief to vomit up our sinful our inward filth he purgeth away Every means of cure he applieth in its proper order and time Tenderly he binds up our painful wounds and by his promise applieth his blood his righteousness and grace to our soul To prevent or recover from sainting fear and despondency he pours out his Spirit sheds abroad his encouraging supporting and refreshful love in our heart by the Holy Ghost How often he visits how kindly he sympathizeth with us in our affliction How greatly he rejoiceth in our recovery How wisely he prescribes such spiritual exercise and diet as infallibly tend to restore and promote our inward health Nor do any ever perish under his handIs he the Lord my God that healeth me My alldiseased soul what wouldst thou that Christ should do unto thee  Christ is the spiritual MIRACLEWORKER  Matth xi John ii Matth xxi John v Mark i Luke viii John v Mark iii v Luke  iii and vii J  n xi John ix Mark vii  Matth xx Matth viii Mark v Matth xiv and x  Matth viii and xv Luke xx i Matth xxi Luke v John xxi It is here supposed Christ's real outward miracles were emblems of his spiritual work  Such as were  dead  in trespasses and sins he raiseth to spiritual and everlasting life To the  blind  and ignorant he giveth saving instruction The  deaf  the stupid  he causeth to hear his melting his still his small his gospel voice The  dumb  he enableth to express themselves in prayer and praise He cleanseth from the  leprosy  of indwelling sin The gospel of peace the glad tidings of salvation he preacheth to sinful men poor wretched miserable blind and naked In consequence of our happy marriage with him he turns our water of adversity into comfort and usefulness he sweetens it enableth to rejoice in it and causeth it to work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory The Jewish confined and carnal sacrifices he threw out of his church and made her a sanctified  house of prayer for all people  Many  Gentile sinners  many Roman subjects notwithstanding all their astonishing ignorance and unbelief he restored to everlasting life Satan he ejects from our heart By a word a touch of his power he cures our spiritual  fever  our longrunning  issues  our aged  impotency  and determines us when we are healed to honour him with the best that we have and to spread abroad the good savour of his fame Along with his command he enables the  withered  to stretch out the hand of faith for a cure Such as are not only spiritually dead but by repeated acts of horrid transgressions seemingly desperate or by long custom  stinking  and utterly lothsome in lust he restores to eternal life and makes the distinguished transgressors the chief of his saints By despised ordinances and promises by conviction of our blindness by the washing of his blood and Spirit he opens our  blind  understanding gradually he increaseth our spiritual knowledge till we see every thing clearly in the immediate vision of God The enraged the torn by Satan he kindly delivers and makes sound in the faith The  storms  of trouble outward or inward his word changeth into a  calm  of peace By a  few  debased apostles he nourished the souls of sinners unnumbered in the wilderness of the people by a  few  despised truths he nourisheth his people in this wildernessworld without diminishing the virtue thereof nay the more of his provision we receive the more we behold to remain How ready to do any thing expected by a vigorous a courageous faith How many of his  betrayers and murderers  did he heal by his saving touch  How fearfully amidst their lazy their fair pretences to holiness did he curse the Jewish church into barrenness and quickly after his ascension make them to  wither away  But witness ye apostles when you  cast the gospelnet  on the  right  on the NewTestament  side  of the church what thousands of souls were caught in it"Sing unto the Lord for he hath done excellent things this is known in all the earth Is any thing too hard for the Lord"  Christ is compared to a MERCHANT  Is lv Rev iii  How infinite is his assortment of all necessary and useful blessings temporal spiritual and eternal In the gospel he publisheth his fulness and his gracious terms of sale How there he constantly exhibits his manifold blessings to attract our affection and excite our souls to buy to receive them as the free the unspeakable the offered "gift of God without money and without price" without righteousness present and without engaging to render a requital How earnest his invitations How enraptured his joy when numbers apply for his benefits and humbly submit to his terms of grace How grieved when we will have none of him will not come to him that we may have life How displeased when by presenting our base our counterfeit our selfrighteousness we aver that his gifts may be purchased with our money and when we try to raise his priceAlway he understands the whole state of his affairs what blessings he hath on hand who are his merchants and what debts they owe and at the last day he will call every man to an accountTrade with him my soul for thy God thy glory and thy  all in all  Christ is compared to a REFINER  Mal iii  Finding his chosen in a state of corruption and misery he breaks them with the hammer of his word melts them in the furnace of a fiery law of fiery troubles and especially of his redeeming love contained in the promise and shed abroad in their heart by the Holy Ghost  the spirit of burning  Thus he purgeth away their corrupt dross and nothing more and forms them into glorious vessels of eternal mercy and happiness By persecution and censure he purgeth his church from scandalous and  naughty persons till at last he present her before God without dross without spot or wrinkle or any such thing Blessed Refiner O when wilt thou purge away all my dross and take away all my tin  Christ is compared to a BUILDER  Zech vi  Upon the foundation of his own infinite love he with his everlasting Father and adored Spirit laid the foundation and built up the whole structure of his new covenant and of our salvation by it The fabric of his human nature he built up in assuming it  this temple  being destroyed by death he in rising from the dead reared  it up in three days  By his birth his life his death his resurrection his ascension intercession and second coming by his word ordinances and influences he builds up the church and temple of God On his own marvellous person he founds it with his blood grace and truth he cements it mysteriously he connects all the parts and concerns thereof according to his ancient purpose and plan he frameth every thing relative to itIt is thine O Jesus to dig us thy chosen out of the quarry of our natural state to hew and form us by regeneration and sanctification to bind us to thyself by mystical union to rear up a structure of grace in each of our hearts build us up in our most holy faith and to adorn and finish the work "with shoutings of grace grace unto itMercy shall be built up for ever"  Christ is compared to a TRAVELLER  Is lxiii  In the greatness of his strength in the display of his love he as it were goeth about in the ordinances and influences of his grace to seek and save sinners even the chief and to visit his people How often he endures the saddest injuries By his word his providence and Spirit how he knocks at the door of our heart How wickedly how shamefully is he often resisted and excluded What ravishing feast of spiritual delights he bestoweth on those who receive him He and his Father enter in and manifest to them the glory and sweetness of their person and love  Christ is compared to a SERVANT  Is xlix  Chearfully he engaged to his Father in the service of our salvation With amazing diligence faithfulness humble  condescension and single regard to his father's honour he assumed our nature and obeyed and suffered in our stead By his word he publisheth by his Spirit he applieth his purchased redemption to our soul In all mediatorial procedure he promotes our everlasting happiness glorifieth his Father to the highest performs the work which he gave him to do and shall receive from him a transcendent an eternal reward of personal glory and a numerous seed What O Redeemer shall I render unto thee for thy service for me "Truly I am thy servant I am thy servant thou hast loosed my bonds"  Christ is called a FORERUNNER  H  b vi  His goings forth for us were  of old from everlasting  With what swiftness strength and courage with what patience chearfulness and joy did he run the race set before him go about doing good healing diseases preaching the gospel obeying the law and suffering death for us Glorious Jesus how much more excellent than all runners How hast thou outrun and exceeded all how hast thou first entered into heaven by thy blood and opened the gates thereof for us and taken possession of it in our name How hast thou at once paved our way and given us a complete pattern Lord  draw  me  we will run after thee  Christ is compared to a BURDENNEARER  Psal lv  He bare our sins and the punishment thereof in his own body upon the tree He bears the care of all his churches On his shoulders of power mercy and love he bears the persons of all his saints and carries them s  fe to the mansions above he bears their cares in lightning their pressure and caring for them he bears their troubles in sympathizing with and supporting them under them he bears their burden of service their work and labour of love in performing it in and for them working in them "to will and to do of his good pleasure"It is thine O Jesus to bear me up under every pressure bear me out against every opposition bear me on in the way of holiness bear me home to glory and bear me in to thy immediate embraces  that where thou art I may be there also to behold thy glory  Christ resembles the KIND SAMARITAN  Luke x  However much hated reproached and abused by our race yet finding us fallen among thievish and murderous devils and corruptions and by them rendered dead in trespasses and sinswhen neither broken nor ceremonial law nor any thing earthly could shew us the least pity or relief he tenderly turneth aside to us binds up our wounds applieth the most effectual medicine commands his angels and ministers to take care of us comfort and help us with the doctrines of his word and promises to them a proper an abundant reward Blessed Redeemer pass by me who am more than  half dead  let my time be  a time of love  and say unto my soul L  VE  Christ resembles LAZARUS of the parable  Luke xvi  In his debased estate he was exceeding poor had no help but in God alone was oppressed with griefs sorrows wounds and bruises As an humbled Saviour he was DIVinely sent to offered and laid at the door of the scribes Pharisees and other Jewsurged on their heart and conscience These being rich in the conceit of their own righteousness many of them rich in worldly honour and wealth and every day refreshed and delighted with the views of their numerous admirers wickedly refused and despised him Mean while numbers of d  tested publicans unclean Gentiles and notorious sinners affectionately applied his blood and suffering for the nourishment of their soul In due time he died quickly he rose again and thereafter amidst innumerable hosts of angels ascended to heaven Soon after God's flaming vengeance to the uttermost came upon his Jewish despisers In a hell of trouble upon earth they were partly awakened and lifted up their eyes partly convicted of his M  ssiahship they earnestly wished further demonstration thereof for themselves their various sects and their brethren of the ten tribes But notwithstanding their requests and their relation to Abraham never shall any but scriptureevidence be allowed them If you believe not this ye children of  men neither will ye "be persuaded though one rose from the dead"  Christ is compared to a TRAVAILING WOMAN  Is liii  Ah how dreadful the pangs the throws the agonies which he underwent How shocking the voice of his roaring How necessary this to accomplish and bring forth our everlasting salvation How comely and pleasant the fruit of his travail "glory to God in the highest peace on earth and good will towards men" No more ask my soul  Doth a man travail with child  Wherefore see I him with his hands on his loins But ask with astonishment ask Doth the Godman travail with child Why O Redeemer see I thee "exceeding sorrowful even unto death amazed and very heavy" Why thy tears thy cries thine anguish Was ever sorrow like unto thy sorrow But now thou rememberest it no more for joy that menchildren are born unto God NOW thou seest thy seed the travail of thy soul and art satisfied  Christ resembles a WOMAN  with a candle sweeping an house to find a lost piece of silver  Luke xv  To search out and bring his chosen people to everlasting life he lights the  candle  of his inspired oracles and preached gospel Often he  sweeps  nations and churches with the besom of fearful calamity He  sweeps  and purgeth places and persons by the dispensation of his ordinances which through the opposition of men raise a mighty stir when they enter a country or conscience Nevertheless Jesus continueth his work till his precious his ransomed ones are to the praise of God the joy of angels and saints recovered from among the reprobate world and the dross of their own corruption O Redeemer how hast thou condescended to seek and save me who was lost how precious have I been in thine eyes shalt not thou be infinitely precious in mine  Christ is compared to an EAGLE  Rev xii  Uncomely indeed were his debased appearances but how infinite is his power all piercing his knowledge unbounded his duration and age speedy his execution of his purpose deep rooted his enmity to Satan and his serpentine seed furious his conquest and destruction of them powerful  and majestic the voice of his word and providence mysterious and incomprehensible the track of his purpose and work royal and large his dominion over all things especially over the household of faith It is thine adored Immanuel with stedfast and comprehensive view to behold the uncreated SUN of Godhead thine to instruct thy people and enable them to apprehend it now by faith hereafter by immediate vision It is thine to ascend on high far above all heavens principality and power and for ever sit down on the right hand of God that with amazing love and vigour thy Spirit may descend to take the prey from the mighty that with amazing but godlike fury thou mayest make thine enemies thy footstool It is thine to love thy children with an infinite invincible love and by kind application of thyself to bring them into spiritual existence It is thine to protect them in danger and hide them in the  munitions of rocks  bear them amidst weakness and as is necessary nourish them with thy

sea or beryl  mark out her fluctuating condition upon earth and the excellency and beauty of her true members their  not turning as they went  represent her progress towards perfection and the gracious perseverance and growth of her saints May not their appearance as  a wheel within a wheel  imply her curious structure with respect to the particular worshipping assemblies comprehended in

Holy Ghost Wonderfully not by human force is she raised up in the world By the sovereign power and free grace of God are her true members digged from their natural state and brought from among the residue of mankind Implored by her fervent prayers shall the righteous Lord bring terrible destruction upon her opposers When wealthiest empires are overturned she however small and despised shall continue and gain ground by their ruin In the last days when the Chaldean Persian Grecian Roman and Tartarian empires are no more she shall extend to all the kingdoms of the earth and in her lofty ordinances shall all flesh see the salvation of God  She is compared to a GARDEN ORCHARD VINEYARD  Is v Song iv and viii Is xxvii Matth xx and xxi  At infinite expence of love of power and blood Jesus purchased her from the justice of God The heart of her chosen members he plows up removes their stony hardness and every other bar in his way Regularly he plants her with his saints his ordinances and grace By the hedge of government and discipline he defends and separates her from the rest of the world By the shining of his countenance and the application of his love he warms and nourisheth her With the river the rain the dew of his word and Spirit he waters  her every moment With his truths and blessings he fattens her By his angels his ministers his providence he watcheth over and keeps her night and day lest any hurt her How dear is she to him and how he delights to walk in her What officers and members he hires to labour in her No feed but that of his word he allows to be cast into her To none but the choice seed of his saints he allows access to her fealing ordinances By a faithful administration of his institutions and by manifold persecutions and afflictions he weeds and prunes off her corruptions Every plant or member is required to bring forth much fruit And to what distress spiritual drought and everlasting danger doth their want of it expose them How often for cumbering his ground for living unprofitably and wickedly in his church doth he cut down professors and cast them into endless sire How often for their spiritual barrenness and noxious corruptions he unhingeth particular churches takes away their hedge of protection and government gives them up to Heathenish and other abominations and suffers the wild beasts of wicked men to waste and deform them at pleasure Nowhere are such noxious weeds such corruptions produced as in an uncultivated church How quickly the nettles and briers of heresies hateful practices and wicked men cover her face and render her a lodging of Satan and his serpentine seed The church is indeed smaller but more useful than all the rest of the world For like a  vineyard of red wine  amidst bloody persecutions she produceth persons and works which cheer the heart of God and man Like an  orchard of pomegranates spikenard and all the chief spices  she produceth saints unnumbered precious savoury and useful and in attainments and conditions very DIVersified These bring forth the rich fragrant and medicinal spices and fruits of holy graces and good works The  keepers  and  husbandmen  to whom Christ lets out his vineyard are her officers who are to cultivate her and return him proper revenues of honour for the talents opportunities and charge affigned them How miserably did God destroy the Jewish keepers who abused his prophets and servants and murdered his Son and gave the vineyard to the  Gentiles Christ's having her  at BaalHamon  imports that now the access to her is large and multitudes enter His  having a thousand and the keepers two hundred  implies that he is to have the chief glory and his ministers their respective subsistence and honour His  hiring labourers to work in her at the third the sixth the ninth and eleventh hour  implies that in different ages of the world as the patriarchal ceremonial apostolic and millennial and in very different seasons of life his chosen are converted and made to labour in his work and at the end all of them shall receive the  penny  the enriching the gracious reward of eternal life From her various worshipping assemblies she is sometimes represented as  gardens  or vineyards  She is compared to a SOWN FIELD  Matth xiii  Jesus her proprietor sows her with the good seed of his word Some of it falls on hearers stupid careless and exposing themselves to every temptation as a  way side  and by Satan and his agents is quickly devoured and snatched from their memory and affection Some of it falls upon hearers hard in heart as  stony ground  who though at first they receive it with joy and affection and seem to commence a flourishing profession and practice yet being scorched by persecution or trouble they quickly wither Some of it falls upon carnal worldlings whose thorns whose earthly cares and lusts choke and render it unfruitful Some of it falls upon renewed hearts who in very different degrees bring forth fruit unto God In her grows up the  good wheat  the saints sown by Jesus Christ and the  tares  hypocrites and seducers sown by Satan in the night of ignorance indifferency trouble or time Nor men nor angels can or are now DIVinely warranted fully to separate the  tares  from the  wheat  But at the lastjudgment a full a final separation shall be effected the saints being gathered into God's heavenly storehouse and the wicked cast into unquenchable fire  She is compared to a THRESHING FLOOR  Matth iii  Here the corn of precious saints and the chaff of hypocritical dissemblers are mingled together in her nay the  corn of grace and chaff of corruption cleave close to one another and by threshing influences troubles and persecutions her ordinary attendants must the chaff be gradually separated from the wheat In her how quickly one generation passeth away and another cometh in their stead Blessed Boaz it is thine to lodge on this thy  floor  which thou hast chosen purchased and prepared It is thine to purge it with the fan of thy word of thine influences and of stormy providences What chaffy multitudes of rebellious Jews and apostate Christians have thy fanning judgments hurried into fearful destruction What millions shall thy trying procedure at the last day blow into endless ruinBe thou my soul solid grain that no trouble nor death nor the eternal judgment may blow me away from Christ and his saints  The gospelchurch resembles the INHERITANCE OF ISRAEL in Ezekiel's vision  Ezek xlvii and xlviii and xlv and xlvi  All her borders are exactly circumscribed in the purpose the covenant and word of God In her the true Israelites his chosen people reside How noted the regularity and harmony of their respective stations and conditions How often do Danites distinguished and early sinners become the first and the most highly privileged saints What equal access for Jews and Gentiles to her fellowship What shares of common gifts and grace sojourning hypocrites often obtain How regularly is their proper work provision and honour assigned to her officers her priests and Levites With what equity do or shall those rulers execute her government and laws How active and successful shall they be as  fishers of men  in the dead sea of this world How glorious are her watering and fructifying truths institutions and influences which issuing from the temple and through the death of Jesus our Lord do in different periods gradually increase and on every hand produce  multitudes of trees  of lively flourishing and fruitful saints How deplorable their end who reap no benefit thereby They shall be cursed into sourness into barrenness and endless ruin In her how high the honour how abundant the portion of her prince and Mediator at whose expence her feasts her  ordinances are observed In midst of her dwells JEHOVAH and shares the centrical portion the supreme honour and glory of all  She especially in the latter days resembles the NEW JERUSALEM in John and Ezekiel's visions  Rev xxi and xxii Ezek xl and xlviii  Her  descending from God out of heaven  marks her heavenly her DIVine erection nature and tendency Her situation on the  south side of an hill  may denote her freedom from the chilling blasts of persecution and trouble and her eminent enjoyment of the influences of her allwarming Sun of righteousness Her appearance as a  jusperstone  imports her purity and comeliness Her  high wall round about  is her DIVinelyprescribed laws and government and her DIVinelybestowed salvation and protection from wo Her  twelve gates of

mysteries protects and allows intimate fellowship to his people  The enlarging of the upper stories of some of these chambers by their jutting into the principal wall  implies that the more holy heavenly and dependent upon God churches and persons are in attending ordinances the more extensive is their gospelliberty The  priests chambers in the outward court towards the north  may mark their distinct functions in the church or the Protestant churches in Europe and North America Their  narrowing as they ascended  implies their being the more exposed to persecution according to their eminency or that in the Protestant churches there shall be great decays as to number and quality and that in the second and especially the third age after the Reformation few eminent members or ministers shall be therein found The  void places between and before the chambers  may represent the abundant access there is to Christian churches and ordinances the light liberty and wholesome air

Levites  signify true Christians who rejoice in bless the Lord and labour in his service May not the  priests  signify ministers who present Christ to us and saints who by faith present him to God and surrender themselves to his service May not the  five hundred reeds of measure on every side of the court  signify the extent of the church in the latterdays and the considerable distinction to be kept up between her and the world Doth not  the whole limit thereof round about being most holy  import that all her ordinances are holy and spiritual not ceremonial and carnal and that holiness ought to be the shining quality of every member in her  She is compared to an HOUSE or PALACE  Prov ix Is liv Rev iv and xv  Curiously Jesus contrived her whole form Upon his own person word and righteousness he lays her foundation With his chosen his lively and precious stones hewn out of the dark quarry of nature by his Spirit quickened formed and polished by his grace and cemented together by himself his love his blood and ordinances he rears her up With sacred statutes with provision of gospeltruth with unsearchable blessings he richly furnisheth her What a place is she of secrecy safety rest devotion and spiritual feasting To prevent her decay and ruin how frequently is she repaired with new generations of saints and supplies of grace Her  being founded on the tops of the mountains and exalted above the hills  implies that remaining for ever founded on Jesus Christ the Rock of salvation she shall be most firmly and conspicuously settled in the world that multitudes may flow unto her Her  foundation of sapphires  is Christ infinitely pure precious glorious and durable and his truths Her  pavement of fair coloured stones  is him as the all glorious foundation of our holy walk or it is saints of the lowest order beautified in him Her  windows of agates  may signify painful and successful ministers who convey light and knowledge to her from her glorious Sun of righteousness and her oracles of inspiration Her  doors and gates of carbuncles  are Jesus in his awful authority fiery sufferings and glorious exaltation as the means of our access to God or they are a loveworking and zealinflaming faith by which we join ourselves to him and his church and may they not also represent the zealous endeavours of  ministers to try persons and admit to sealing ordinances only such as are visibly saints and faithful Her  borders of pleasant stones  are her precious her comely well fixed and durable saints ordinances discipline and government Her  cedar beams and pillars  are the fragrant firm and lasting ministers saints promises and ordinances by which she is adorned and supported Her  rafters and galleries of fir  are her shadowy refreshful and comely

refreshed strengthened satisfied delighted instructed and rendered fruitful in good works Her  table  is the ordinances of God on which his fulness is exhibited to us Her  throne of grace  is Jesus as the fulfiller of all righteousness in whom God is for ever well pleased and rests  The sea of glass before the throne mingled with fire  on which the saints for ever stand and are bold before God is Jesus' all cleansing allsupporting blood as flowing from his flaming love and applied by his  Spirit of burning  or it is the gospel applied by the Spirit to our conscience for encouraging us to bold appearances and servent supplications before God  She is compared to an INN  Luke x  For accomodating and refreshing the people of God in their heavenly journey she is erected In her ministers are appointed to wait on the travelling saints and afford them medicine milk or strong meat as their case requires Are not the two inspired Testaments are not ministerial gifts and graces the  two pence  bestowed by our kind Samaritan upon these  hosts  on earth for the assistance of his people And is not everlasting glory their additional rewardBeware my soul of resting in ordinances or attainments but hasten forward to thy long home the  better country  above  She resembles a CHAMBER and BANQUETINGHOUSE  Song i and ii  How richly furnished with every thing comely and useful with all the nourishing fulness of God In her how sweetly Jesus manifests himself to his people feasts them with his goodness allows them his intimate fellowship reveals to them his secrets and protects them from their enemies  She resembles a GREEN and WELLGUARDED BED  Song i and iii  What sweet communion have the saints here with Christ and with one another How sweetly here be dwells and rests in his love With what amazing pleasure he here declareth it to us and maketh us to enjoy its endearing fruits Is it not here that saints and graces are begotten are born are nourished and appear with constant verdure glory and freshness What armed guard of infinite perfections of holy angels and faithful ministers surround her on every side all determined during her night of trouble and time to protect her in safety and to execute vengeance on her enemies  She is compared to a WALL  Song viii  Being established in the faith of his word cemented by his person and blood and by their mutual love and spiritual fellowship her true members are built on Christ the foundation In them and in her whole form she is erected straight heavenward How strong in him and what an useful means of protecting men from the storms of temptation and wrath What a separator between professed saints and profane sinners  Her towers  are the oracles ordinances and ministers of God by which she opposeth her spiritual enemies when they come in like a flood  The silver palace built upon her  implies her being the honoured habitation of Father Son and Holy Ghost and that by her means we ascend to the celestial state  She is compared to a DOOR  Song viii  In her Jesus the  door  the way the truth and the life is exhibited and the  door  of faith the door of gospel offers and of mens hearts is opened She is the  door  of passage to the innerchambers of endless felicity Nor ought any but visible saints to be admitted into the chambers of her sealing institutions And is she not DIVinely inclosed  with the  cedarboards  of ordinances providences and graces  She is compared to a GOLDEN CANDLESTICK  Rev i  How great her beauty and value From Christ the light of life her gifts and graces are lighted and by her doctrine discipline and holy conversation she communicateth the light of instruction to others Her situation in the world is often varied and in the morning of endless glory her present form shall be laid aside Her  oil  is the gospel and grace of God The  pipes  of conveyance are faithful minstrations of truth The "two olivetrees that empty the oil out of themselves" may signify ministers who communicate gospeltruth to others or Christ's natures and offices by which the Holy Ghost is communicated to men  The church is like unto a FIRE  Obid  In her dwells the Spirit of judgment and burning In her the word of God is like unto fire inflaming and melting the hearts of men In her what multitudes are refined from their drossy corruptions How terrible and destructive is she to her enemies

governed by his opposers and the doctrines and laws to which they attend and their customs and conduct are the reverse of those that are appointed by him  They are called SYNAGOGUES OF SATAN  Rev iii

and wicked practices  They resemble LUKEWARM WATER and a CAKE NOT TURNED  e  Pretending some regard to DIVine truths and ordinances but wanting the love of them  Rev ii  they mix idolatry and other corruptions with some remains of God's true worship they fear him and serve their own god's and so render themselves abominable to him and his people and are in the utmost hazard of being spued out of his mouth into everlasting ruin  Why they are compared to  old men  with grey hairs without knowing it and to  roaring lions rapacious birds corrupt carcases barren vineyards  and  empty vines  See in Jews chap xiii § No  The Antichristian state or Papacy is called a MAN OF SIN  a Thess ii  How wonderfully it is connected in its parts How marvellously all of them sympathize with and support one another What pretence it makes to reason and to the advantage of mankind The Pope who overseeth directs and governs is the head his submissive and wickedlyactive clergy are the hands and their common subjects the feet And how monstrously sinful and wicked is the whole system of his doctrines laws worship miracles offices officers and courses  Antichrist is called the SON OF PERDITION  Thess ii Tim iii  By the destructive vengeance of God on men for not receiving his truth in the love of it was the rise thereof permitted The Pope and his thorough paced agents go about seeking whom they may devour Their doctrine their laws and example effectually tend to the everlasting ruin of multitudes Their beloved their habitual labour is to destroy the souls and bodies of men The period of their power is a  perilous time  for they have consciences seared as with a hot iron ignorant and stupified they speak lies in hypocrisy promote doctrines of devils forbidding to marry and to enjoy meats which God hath prepared for use they are lovers of themselves covetous proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent intemperate fierce heady high minded despisers and haters of those that are good  Antichrist is compared to a WHORE  Rev xvii See  Morning Exercises  and discourses of Episcopalian DIVines  against

seduce multitudes into error idolatry will worship and other parts of spiritual whoredom with them For this end how they deck up their offices and cause with the most plausible pretences to piety and reason How they delude men with the most engaging outward appearances of earnal pomp and splendor Under pretence of chastity how they decry marriage and yet wallow in all manner of uncleanness The  scarletcoloured beast with seven heads and ten horns  upon which she rideth is the blasphemous and bloody empire of Rome which had seven different forms of government and is now DIVided into ten principal sovereignties over which the Pope did or doth exercise his power  The many waters on which she sitteth  are the noisy multitude of people subject to her authority Her  purple and scarlet clothing  marks out the purple livery of her cardinals her amazing pride her high pretences to more than royal sovereignty and her bloody presecution of the saints The  golden cup full of filthiness in her hand  is the unhallowed means which the taketh to ensnare and defile the souls of men Her  name on her forehead Mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth  imports her high pretences to lying wonders and her astonishing impudence in the filthiest crimes Her being  drunk with the blood of saints  implies her cruel and bloody persecution of them her delighting to murder and massacre them The  burning of her flesh with fire by the ten kings once subject to her  implies their angry utter and fearful destruction of the Papal constitution power and revenue in the time appointed by God  Antichrist is called SODOM  Rev xi    What pride fulness of bread and abundance of idleness are with her numerous devotees What shocking bestiality Sodomy fornication adultery and every other fleshly and mental impurity prevail in Popish countries Do not you Antichristian clergy for a pitiful price allow men to practise the vilest abominations What numbers of licensed stews are at Rome Are you not lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God How often you creep  into mens houses to defile their spouses and daughters with your whoredom and error  Past feeling  how you abandon yourselves to all uncleanness to work it with greediness And shall not you and your followers like Sodom be set up as monuments of wrath  suffering the vengeance of eternal fire  Antichrist is called EGYPT  Rev xi  How terrible is the Popish oppression of and murdering the saints How fearful their destruction of the souls of men How shocking and cruel the slavery of their subjects How absurd their superstition How base their idolatry in worshipping waxen wafers images of a cross relics of dead men pretended or real old rags or chips of wood  c  Antichrist is called BABYLON THE GREAT  Rev xvii  How astonishing and widespread the Popish power and dominion How did their agents captivate and enslave the nations and people of God What magic idolatry superstition persecution and murder abound among them And shall not this state and system be overthrown by the special providence of God and Rome its principal seat be reduced to a lasting ruin The  tenth part of this city ruined by an earthquake  is a part of the Romish state perhaps Italy overturned by the fearful judgments of God  Antichrist is compared to a BEAST  Rev xiii  What stupidity absurdity and ignorance prevail in his doctrines laws and members Its  rising out of the sea  imports his obtaining of power amidst times of trouble confusion perplexity and over multitudes of unsettled subjects of the Roman empire Its  seven heads  signify seven forms of government used at Rome and issuing and concentering in the Papacy Its  ten horns  are the ten kingdoms subject to Popery  Names of blasphemy in the forehead  imply open reviling of God and his truths and of Christ in his office and work Its  feet of a bear  imply excessive cruelty firm retention of votaries and outrageous murder of men in their soul body and name Its  appearance of a leopard  imports craft cruelty and being spotted with abominations unnumbered Its  mouth of a lion  imports the roaring  forth of frightful threatenings and the powerful exercise of devouring influence The  healing of one of its wounded heads  implies the restoration of power to the city of Rome in the person of the Pope after the Heruli and others extirpated the imperial or the restoring to him the power which he lost at the Protestant reformation This first beast represents Antichrist in his civil influence His  rising from the earth in form of another beast  may denote the rise of his power ecclesiastic from obscurity by carnal means and to promote earthly and carnal ends Its  being like a lamb  imports his pretence to innocency purity and usefulness and his usurpation of Christ's office as a Surety and Priest Its  two horns  denote his connected civil and ecclesiastic power and authority or his power of order and doctrine bniding and loosing in the church Its  speaking like a dragon  imports his terrible curses censures excommunications and interdicts against his opposers  His causing men to make and worship an image of the first beast  may signify his obliging them to reverence the poor shadow of authority restored to Rome by the Popish clergy His  mark in mens hands  implies their swearing to or practising his abominations His  mark on their foreheads  implies their bold and daring profession of his errors idolatry and superstition  Six hundred threescore and six the number of his name  marks out the Latin church whose Latin service was appointed in A D The letters of this number from LATEINOS and ROMIITH that is Latin and Romish The apparently regular construction of this number may denote the seeming regularity of the Antichristian system of doctrines offices officers Or twenty five the squareroot of this number may point out the articles of the Popish creed and their multitude of other matters regulated by twentyfive  The Antichristian state is represented as a HABITATION OF DEVILS A CAGE OF EVERY UNCLEAN BIRD  Rev xviii  In her Satan and his angels reign Her principal members are a kind of devils incarnate Her whole system is constituted of unclean doctrines worship offices  officers customs Shall it not at length appear so to men Shall not Rome the revered seat of her dignity become an unsightly desolation  The Antichristian state is represented as a VISIBLE WORLD  Rev xvi  Her  earth  may signify her fundamental articles of the pope's supremacy infallibility

seat of the beast  her general constitution or the dwelling of the Pope Her  mountains and islands  her deep rooted remains of doctrine worship discipline and government together with her monasteries

water the north parts of Italy which abounds with rivers the  sun  the Emperor or King of France the  seat of the beast  the middle part of Italy perhaps the same with Aarmageddon the  islands and mountains  Sicily Malta  c  The  vials poured out thereon  and the  Hail and earthquakes  are the terrible harassing and overturning judgments of God sent to destroy her  The POPE is compared to a GOD  Thess ii  By adding to or taking from the word and worship of God by pretending to pardon sin or indulge men in it by usurping Christ's headship over his church and opposing his person office and grace by usurping authority over the civil magistrate enthroning and deposing him at pleasure and by working pretended miracles to confirm their abominations he and his agents set themselves in the room of and  exalt themselves above God  The Pope is called the ANGEL  of the bottomless pit whose name in Hebrew and Greek is a destroyer  Rev ix  Being sent excited and directed by Satan he promotes the interests of hell ripens multitudes for its everlasting destruction and with amazing craft and vigour persecuteth the saints who oppose his designs and is a  fearful stumblingblock to the Jews and ruinous plague to the Gentiles  He resembleth the KING in Daniel's vision who  doth according to his will magnifies himself above every God  c  Dan xi Rev xix  Making his own pleasure his sole supreme rule of conduct he exalts himself above magistrates angels and the true God blasphemes his Makerat once contemns the idols of the ancient Heathen and the God of the primitive Christians Lawful marriage he vilipends and prohibits to his clergy Instead of and together with the true God he honours the images of angels the relics and pictures of saints offers them rich presents and for gain pretends to assign them their respective countries cities occupations and cases in which they are to oversee protect and bless He rules over great multitudes which being assembled by him do with him fight against the Lord Jesus Christ but in the end shall be wrathfully overcome and ruined and the followers of Jesus enriched with their spoil  He resembles the LITTLE HORN in Daniel's vision  which had eyes spake perverse things and subdued three horns  Dan vii  His power was inconsiderable at first but he quickly made himself master of three sovereignties the dukedom of Rome the exarchate of Ravenna and the region of Pentapolis With amazing craft and circumspection with numerous spies prying into the councils of men with terrible blasphemy boasting perfecution and curses he did and doth promote his unhallowed interests  CHAP XIII  Metaphors respecting nations armies samilies and their adjuncts which being almost innumerable but generally more restircted in their signification and less edifying no more is here intended than such an explanatory swatch as may serve for a key to the rest  SECT I FIRST  Metaphors respecting nations more generally considered  ALL nations are represented as the TWO SONS of a family  Matth xxi Luke xv  The Jews are the ELDER the Gentiles the YOUNGER The former God by his word required to  work in the vineyard  of his church Fairly they engaged and readily they promised to serve him but quickly broke their engagement Long the latter lived in open rebellion but at last influenced by his converting grace they repented and complied with his call Long like prodigals they deserted their Father's family and church till deep sense of their spiritual need brought them to themselves and made them enquire what they should do to be sayed How readily then did JEHOVAH meet them in mercy embraced them with love arrayed them with the  best robe  of his sons righteousness feasted them with his flesh and blood adorned them with his ordinances and influences But why ye Jews did you repine at his honouring them above you who had long been his peculiar children and servants Was it not meet that there should be an abundant display of heavenly bounty and gladness when God's solong  lost children were found  when your solong  dead brethren were made alive  Rejoice ye Gentiles with his people for to him we seek in him we trust and his rest shall be glorious  All nations are compared to the SMALL DROP of a bucket DUST  of the balance  and NOTHING before God  a  How small insignificant unsubstantial  b  Is xl  worthless How easily tossed troubled and ruined What then Lord am I one man the dregs of my race that I should possess the GREAT UNKNOWN the INFINITE ALL  The Gentile nations before the spread of the gospel are called a LITTLE SISTER  without breasts  Song viii  Though many of their progeny were chosen by and in the purpose of God united to Christ yet they made no appearance as a church had no breasts of inspired oracles DIVine ordinances or gospelministers wherewith to edify the souls of men  Perhaps the Gentile nations are compared to a BARREN DESOLATE and  refused  WOMAN  Is liv and lv  And they are called a NATION which  Christ knew not  Before his death they for many ages produced almost no children to him They were deserted and rejected by him He took no peculiar notice of them brought them into no churchrelation to him But blessed be the Lord more have now been the spiritual children of this barren woman than ever were of the Jewish churchBut perhaps this  barren woman  signifies the church during Christ's personal presence with her on earth And the  children of the desolate being more than they of the married wife  Implies that after Christ's withdrawment to heaven the converts to him should be most numerous  The Gentiles before the spread of the gospel among them are called FOREIGNERS  Eph ii  They were without visible interest in or connection with God in Christ and destitute of the offers of his grace the doctrines of his word or the laws of his kingdom They had no spiritual fellowship with his holy nation no claim to his covenants of promise no hope of a Messiah or salvation by him or of a resurrection to eternal life but were destitute of the knowledge the image the fear the worship and saving fellowship of God Thrice happy that those who were once afar off are brought nigh by the blood of Christ But ah what multitudes of persons and nations still remain in that wretched condition  Nations without the church before or after the  death of Christ are compared to a DESART WILDERNESS  Is xxxv  How barren and unprofitable to God and to one another Not plowed with his influence nor fown with his word ordinances or grace nor hedged about with his special government and protection no  way of holiness  that leadeth to life no flocks of converted men nor their footsteps no sweet fruits of holy men or truly righteous works no wells of salvation nor green pastures of evangelic institutions no bread of life were or are there to be foundBut alas what evil beasts what wicked angels and men what perplexity and unsettledness of mind how to satisfy an immortal soul what surrounding hazards of eternal consequence what blasts of conquering temptation and wrathful calamity what mists of ignorance idolatry profaneness delusion and willworship abound  Particular nations are compared to the UNIVERSE  Is xxiv Mark xiii Psal lxxxii Rom xiii  The more glorious part of their members and laws are the  heavens  and  luminaries  thereof and the rest the  air  the  earth  and the  rivers  The magistrates are represented as  God  as  children  as  ministers of God  because in his name they rule over and are revered and obeyed by their subjects The  sword which they bear not in vain  is their power and authority to protect the innocent and punish the offenders  Particular nations are represented as FAMILIES  Psal cxxxvii  The country as the  mother  the magistrates as  fathers  who cherish govern protect and provide for the people who are the  children  the  sons  or  daughters  Sometimes the principal city is represented as the  mother  and the lesser cities suburbs or villages are termed the  daughters  Sometimes for likeness of manners natural relation  c  one nation is designed the  sister  of another  They are compared to HARLOTS  Is xxiii Nah iii Ezek xvi and xxiii Jer iii  What deceitful and base methods they often take to promote their trade their power and authority How often they boast of and seduce those around to idolatrous and whorish departing from God How justly God execueth  upon them the judgment of whorish women stirring up their friends to hate and harass them and by openly destroying them in the fire

are corrupted perplexed and discouraged To  shave off the hair of the beard the head and feet  is shamefully to cut off and carry captive both great and small  Fatness  implies abundance of men wealth or prosperity  Leanness  imports fewness of persons and poverty of condition  Paleness  implieth shame and confusion To  wax old  is to lose courage vigour strength or authorityMagistrates are the  breath of their nostrils  by which their life vigour and influence are maintained  They are represented as systems of BEASTS of the field air or sea  Dan iv Ezck xxix and xxxi  And magistrates are represented as the principal animals of those kinds as  lions bears eagles dragons leviathan  Sometimes for their refreshful protecting and supporting influence magistrates are represented as  trees  on which their subjects do nestle or under which they shelter themselves Sometimes  horns  denote their kings who defend their own subjects and harass others  They are compared to HERDS and FLOCKS  Jer xxiii Ezek xxxiv  The country is their fold and pasture Magistrates are their  shepherds  who watch over protect govern and provide for their subjects Great men are their  rams hegoats bulls kine

their glory and prosperity  Heifers taught  represent them as accustomed to subjection  Backsliding heifers  represent them as perversely apostatizing from God To cry or  lift up the voice liks an

sometimes because dwelling on the seacoastA  breach like the sea  de notes a very wide one  They are likened to a FOREST  Hos ii Ezek xx  because of the multitude of persons cities and villages And magistrates and great men are represented as  tall trees topbranches  and those of low condition as  low trees  They are represented as VINEYARDS  Is xvii and xxiv Jer vi  Hedged about with government kept and cultivated by rulers how great the order and advantage of their connected  state Cities are the  boughs  and  branches  Multitudes of people are the fruit  Two or three berries left  signify a small remnant saved in the vintage of desolating judgmentsA  forsaken bough  is a desolate city To  glean and turn the hand into the basket  is gradually to destroy or lead captive the remnant left at the first To  plant the vineyard with strange slips  is to bring in foreign people doctrines or customs into a nationLord how easily canst thou plant or pluck up destroy  branch and rush in one day

hand of thy providence  SECT II  Metaphors respecting the Jews Egyptians Assyrians Chaldeans Persians Greeks Romans Tyrians Turks with their adjuncts  FIRST  Metaphors respecting the Jews  THE Jews are likened to an ELDER SON  Luke xv Matth xxi  They were God's  firstborn  first of the nations he distinguished them in his favour readily they professed the highest regard to the DIVine law and came under the most solemn engagements to obedience yet after continuing many ages in peculiar relation to God they wilfully despised his counsel and rejected the Messiah sinfully they fretted and many of them blasphemed because under the gospel the Gentiles were more highly favoured of God than themselves  They resemble the RICH MAN in the parable  Luke xvi  Glorying in their wealth their numerous rites and traditions their relation to God and their pious ancestors they contemptuously rejected the debased Saviour while unclean publicans harlots and Heathens received him Notwithstanding all their pomp the flaming vengeance of God came upon them Terrible and hopeless were the torments and miseries into which they were plunged nor could the covenant made with Abraham their ancestor yield them any relief nor could their desperate  wishes obtain further evidence of Jesus Messiahship for themselves and their various sects or for their brethren of the ten tribes  They are likened to an INFANT  lying in blood vile unpitied unassisted of men but quickened furnished adorned and espoused of God  Ezek xvi  Not for their righteousness' sake but for his name's sake he raised them up from an idolatrous polluted and despicable origin Marvellously he preserved and multiplied them into a nation in Egypt Though they were contemned and hated of all around he honoured them with his

xxiii Jer iii  Contrary to equity to decency and to solemn covenant with God they forsook his law worshipped idols and polluted themselves with every abominable course Treacherously they distrusted and rejected the Lord imitated the idolatry and relied on the assistance of the Egyptians Assyrians and Chaldeans For a while these of Judah and Benjamin condemned the enormities of Sodom and of the ten tribes but though warned by their destruction they at last surpassed them in wickedness and so justified their conduct They had a  whore's forehead  rushing impudently on sin and of their own motion and at their own expence seeking after sinful connection with the Heathen and communion with them in their  false worship Long God hired them with a goodly land and favours innumerable to be for him and not for another but provoked with their treacherous crimes he punished them by the hand of those nations which they had so fondly relied on and imitated he cast them out of their church relation to him and refused to shew them mercy But rejoice you feed of Jacob you shall be as though you had not been cast off In the wilderness of adversity God shall speak unto your heart and make you return to your former husband with whom it was better with you than now "Though the vision tarry wait for it for at the end it will speak and will not tarry"  They are represented as a WOMAN  cast

abandoned to unnatural lust How shameless in sinning How ready their people to  commit and their rulers to protect the vilest crimes In the Assyrian harassment and Chaldean captivity how justly exposed as public monuments of DIVine wrath  They are likened to a SPECKLED BIRD against which all the fowls around assembled  Jer xii  How distinguished from others by their ordinances laws and customs And how hated and sought for to destruction by the nations around And alas how spotted with their own corruptions But the word rather signifies a TALONED RAPACIOUS FOWL and represents them as

taught them  by giving them his laws He  passed over their fair neck  by encouraging them with prosperity or by alarming them with adversity He made  Ephraim to ride  by strengthening the ten tribes against Judah in the days of Jeroboam the second and of Pekah the son of Remaliah or made them  to be rode upon  by giving the Assyrians power to captivate and oppress them Judah's  ploughing  and Jacob's  breaking his clods  may import the Jews slavery in Chaldea Their  ploughing wickedness reaping iniquity and eating the fruit of lies  imply their proceeding from evil to worse and receiving at last the due reward of their crimes when like  backsliding heisers  they had long persisted in obstinate apostacy from God  They are represented as  abused lost and scattered sheep  Ezek xxxiv Jer l  Ah how abused oppressed and misled by their wicked rulers and false prophets How in their captivity driven from their pasture in the promised land scattered one from another exposed to injuries

furious destruction of of their enemies Joseph's seed to a YOUNG BULLOCK because of their glory their strength and their royalty among the ten tribes Ah how changed when like  silly doves without heart  without hope wisdom or care to avoid the destruction and ravage of the Assyrian bands Issachar to an ASS for their strength patience and labour in husbandry Dan to a LIONS WHELP  and  SERPENT for their daring courage in war and their craft in destroying their enemies How like a  lion's whelp  when leaping to the borders of Bashan to take Laish How in Samson did they like a  serpent  bite the horse heels and make the Philistines on their temple and otherwise to fall backward Benjamin to a  ravening  WOLF for their warlike courage and their readiness to take the prey from their enemies Naphthali to a HIND  let loose  because of their kind and lovely behaviour their bravery in war and their expedition in business Gad to a LION because of their daring boldness and their safe dwelling beside enemiesAh how sin changed the condition of those Jews made them under trouble  roar like bears mourn sore like doves hiss as serpents wail as dragons  and  enlarge their baldness as eagles  They are likened to the HAIRS of a man's head  Ezek v  How weak and insignificant The  shaving  or  cutting them off  imports the killing or carrying them captive or the unhinging of their church and

xiii Matth xxi Jer xxiv  Amidst their fair flourishing and widespread leaves of profession how destitute of good works even when Jesus was among them For forty years after his death his intercession

away  under his curse In more ancient times were not those carried captive with Jehoiachin as  good figs  acceptable and useful and these who continued behind  bad ones  unprofitable and hateful  They are likened to a VINEYARD and VINE  Is v Ezek xv Deut xxxii  God gave them the fertile land flowing with milk and honey The stony and stubborn Canaanites he digged out from before them The  wall  and  hedge  of his protection and law he assigned to them The  wine press  of his tabernacle temple and ordinances he built among them With the  rain  of his oracles the  dew  of his favours he watered them Originally they were a  right seed  a  choice vine  the seed of Abraham Isaac and Jacob God's friends who commanded their households to walk in the way of the Lord but how sadly they  degenerated

our heart How different the degrees of its brightness as it is more or less carefully snuffed and preserved from alteration or misinterpretation How ealy and often removed from one place to another How often do ministers therewith light up Jesus' friends to their celestial chambers and return themselves to the blackness of darkness It is a light only suited to the night of time and small in

delightful or stormy cast it into his church and the hearts of his people that it may bud and grow up it must be hid in our heart dwell in us richly and be covered with meditation and prayer nor immediately after it is sown must we expect sensibly to perceive and enjoy its good fruits The frost of affliction and temptation is useful to deepen its root and kill the weeds of corruption that spontaneously spring up in our soul in order to choke it But chiefly the warmth of the Sun of righteousness the rain and dew of the blessed Spirit and the influences of the moon of instituted ordinances concur to promote its growth If it be early and abundantly sown and if the earliest buds of corruption be carefully nipt it prospers the more if superficially received either Satan and his

heart Do I  live not by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God  Do I more carefully more frequently attend the repast of my soul than of this mortal worm my body Happy I that though the meat be cut off from the field there is enough in my Fa+ther's inspired granary and to spare Eat my soul that which is good and delight thyself in fatness Bread shall be given me and my water shall be sure No drought nor heat can smite no east wind can blast the field of his promises No poverty idleness or guilt can break my title to his provision Work not therefore thy own works but believe eat drink and be merry for thine eternal TOMORROW shall be as this day and  much more abundant  It is compared to HONEY  Psal xix  How glorious its origin Here by the amazing skill care and labour of an incarnate God the quintessence of creation of more than ten thousand creations of Godhead is prepared for us How ravishing its sweetness delightfully sickening my heart and rendering even troubles sweeter than honey to my taste How effectually it softens our inward powers searcheth and heals our spiritual sores recovers from inward consumptions purgeth and nourisheth our soul Yet ah how lothed by many who have access to itJohn's little book was  sweet in his mouth but bitter in his belly  With pleasure he received the knowledge of future events but was grieved to think of the foreseen adversities of the church of GodBe thou my soul a busy bee gathering honey from every inspired flower so shall that which is set on my table be full of fatness full of ravishing sweetness For ever I shall feed on pure on redeeming Godhead as my ALL IN ALL  It is compared to MILK  sincere  and uncorrupted  Pet ii Heb v  O its purity and sweetness its nourishing restoring healing and purifying influence How much desired and valued by the saints how proper food in their earthly and infantile state what noble remedy under their spiritual consumptions O the abundance Here for abundance of milk every one may eat may wash his steps in butter Butter and honey shall every one eat that dwells in our new covenantland that they may know to refuse the evil and choose the goodThe more plain truths of God's word are likened to  milk  while the rest are compared to  strong meat  The weakest saints can spiritually understand receive and digest the former while only those who are grown in grace and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ can understand feed on and improve the latter Lord I must feed with the weakest on thy plain promises And O how plain plain pleasant they are to my heart  It is compared to GOLD FINE GOLD  Psal cxix  How pure precious solid and durable How glorious useful enriching adorning How substantial and weighty containing much in few words How thoroughly tried amidst flaming persecutions fiery trials of enraged opposers and in the fierylike experience of the saints What a sovereign medicine to heal our running sores of corruption What a sovereign cordial to revive and re store a drooping spirit Covet earnestly my soul this best thing this gold that shall keep me and shall in all cases and countries pass current between me and my God  It is compared to SILVER TRIED  in a furnace and seven times purified  Psal xii  How pure precious shining and useful O the sevenfold flames of trouble and persecution that it hath endured And was it not O blessed Jesus refined to the highest in thy fiery deathDidst thou my soul ever find dross in him or his word  It is likened to a RICH SPOIL and TREASURE a HERITAGE  Psal cxix  It is the fruit of Christ's victory over  sin Satan and the world It contains an inexpressible fulness of grace and glory  all the fulness of God  sufficient to enrich millions of destitute sinners How highly valued and safely secured by Christ and his people He hides it in his hand and they hide it in their heart Evermore Lord let me follow thee to DIVide this spoil to share this inheritance as an heir of Christ  It resembles a PLOUGH  Hos x  Being DIVinely applied to our heart it  breaks up the fallowground  breaks the roots of corruption and prepares us for receiving the good feed of grace The more obdurate our heart the more powerful deep and close must the application of the word be How proper for its more effectual operation is the winter of adversity and the springtide of youth How necessary that every application be attended with the rainy influences of the Holy Spirit  It is compared to a ROD and STAFF  Psal xxiii and xlv and cx  By it Jesus the great Shepherd of the sheep hints his will draws directs supports and comforts his people When I walk through the troublous valley of the shadow of death let this rod and staff comfort me so shall I fear no evilIt is  the rod of Christ's strength  and his SCEPTRE  of righteousness  By it he displays his power equity and finished righteousness in the conviction conversion and sanctification of his people and by it he displays his sovereignty authorizeth his ordinances and testifieth his kindness to his people and orders destruction for his enemies  It is compared to an HAMMER  Jer xxiii  By it God beats and breaks our hard hearts fastens in them the nails of convincing influences of regulating precepts awing threatenings sanctifying and encouraging promisesWhen thy words O Master of assemblies are by thee fixed in my soul I am prickt to the heart all my powers cry out What shall I do to be saved Give me Christ or else I die  It is compared to a SWORD and called  e sword of the Spirit  Psal xlv Eph vi  It was the Spirit who framed and en  ited it and by applying it to our soul he wounds  our conscience slays our lust pierceth and subdues our heart How excellent its metal and form for the spiritual warfare By managing it aright we through the Spirit convince or silence the erroneous defend our soul overcome our spiritual enemies subdue the slavishfear of death mortify our lusts glorify God and promote ourselves to everlasting honour  It is likened to BOW and ARROWS  Psal xlv  By means thereof God powerfully suddenly and often somewhat imperceptibly convinceth converts and subdues sinners to himselfLord cause the arrows of thy truth and influence stick fast in the heart of thine enemies to make the people fall in subjection under thee  It resembles the TOWER  of David builded for an armoury whereon hang a thousand shields of mighty men  Song iv and vii  How strong invincible and glorious How richly furnished with all the armour of God Here is  the sword  of sufficient arguments against every temptation and error  the shield  of God himself and of faith in him to avert every fiery dart or deathful push  the girdle  of faithful promises and DIVine truths to fortify and encourage our heart  the breastplate  of imputed righteousness and sanctifying grace to secure our soul  the helmet  of a well grounded  hope of salvation  the  shoes  of gospelprinciples and the  artillery  of manifold prayers Choose O my soul thine armour from hence there is none like it Lord give it me  The scriptures resemble a BANQUETING HOUSE  where the guests are embannered with Jesus' love  Song li  By bringing us into the spiritual knowledge thereof what stores of reposited blessedness he discovers to us How sweetly he feasts refresheth strengthens and animates to the spiritual warfare with his love which is better than wine  They are compared to Solomon's  green and guarded  BED  Song i and iii  What sweet rest in communion with and sanctifying and fructifying influence do we therein receive from Jesus Christ while DIVine perfections holy angels and vigilant ministers unnumbered do  guard and defend us till the cold dark and dangerous night of trouble and time come to an end  God's word is compared to a WAY or PATH  John  Planned by the wisdom of God owned by the King of kings it points out the way to obtain the heavenly country and city It supports the saints who with pleasure and progress follow one another in attending to depending on and walking thereinHere walk my soul so shall I never be ashamed Nor let me have greater joy than to see Zion's children walking in the truth more and more receiving it into their heart and practising it in their life  It is compared to a RULE REED or MEASURINGLINE  Ezek xl c  It is indeed contemned by a carnal world but is the exact the useful the DIVinely appointed standard of all the forms and ordinances of the church and of every part of our conduct and by which we shall be judged at lastAlway therefore my soul enquire  what saith the Lord  It is compared to a GLASS  Cor iii  Through it we behold our own insufficiency and filthiness the glory of God in Christ the momentous reality of eternal things and the true path of holiness that leadeth to eternal happiness Behold in this glass my soul thyself and be humbled behold the glory of Christ that thou mayest be changed into the same image from glory to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord Nor be thou a forgetful hearer that quickly forgets what manner of appearance he saw  CHAP IV  Metaphors respecting law and gospel which are the two principal parts of God's word The law teacheth us what duty God requireth of us and the gospel what blessings be freely giveth to us    Metaphors respecting the law  THE law is represented as a SCHOOLMASTER  to bring us to Christ  Gal  ii  The moral law shews us our need of him for by it is the knowledge of sin it  demands of us that righteousness which we can only find in him chargeth us to embrace him as soon as he is revealed and offered and prevents our quiet resting in any thing till we find him Darkly the ceremonial law pointed out the mystery of Christ and by hard services and carnal ordinances led to his person righteousness and grace as the fulfilling end of its types and shadows  The law is called a KILLING LETTER  Cor iii  No law of itself can give us any life but kills our vain hopes and imaginations Sin taketh occasion from it to abound and promote our spiritual death The moral law as a covenant condemns us to all manner of death in sin and wo Simply considered the ceremonial law consisted of lifeless rites and services which used without respect to Christ entailed curses and death upon its subjects as they led them away from the fountain of life to their own righteousness by which they could not live Howbeit God's punishing Israel by  giving them statutes that were not good  is not to be understood of the ceremonial law but of God's giving them up to obey the sinful edicts of Jeroboam and his idolatrous successors  It is called a LAMP and LIGHT  Prov vi  It plainly points out our duty and blemishes in heart and life And how pleasant to be directed by it in Christ's way  It is called a PATH and WAY  Psal cxix  Being planned by God and plain in itself we are to exercise ourselves in it by making progress towards the city of God How  peaceful  Great peace with God and with their own conscience have all they who love and walk in it and when a man's ways please the Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him How  plain  nothing shall offend them who walk therein How  pleasant  to walk together in unity with DIVine persons and fellow saints How  holy just and good  None but holy persons the redeemed of the Lord walk there nothing but holy exercises is a walking therein How  spiritual  unseen but to the spiritual man and walked in by serving God in the Spirit rejoicing in Christ Jesus and having no confidence in the flesh How  strait  excluding  every unregenerate person and every sinful thought word or deed How  exceeding broad  requiring duties unnumbered in every circumstance of heart and life How  safe  the wayfaring man though a fool shall not err therein It is a  way of life  walked in by the living in Jerusalem a way wherein life is ever communicated and which leadeth to life as an eternal but gracious reward It is  above  is heavenly in its origin nature and tendency and by it we depart from hell which is beneath Here let me ever run when God enlargeth my heart  It is compared to a HEDGE  Eccles x  Thereby God limits our motions and points out whether we may or may not go To what hurt in his work and what punishment in the issue doth the breaker of it expose himself The old serpent the devil the serpent of a stinging conscience and the serpent of God's judgments shall bite him  It is represented as a YOKE BANTS CORDS  Psal ii  By DIVine authority it restrains our sinful liberty and madness and keeps us to our station and work How galling to our corrupt nature and lusts and at what endless peril we attempt to shake it off by refusing obedience to it The law as a rule in the hand of Christ is an  easy yoke and light burden  it is lined with his redeeming love sweetened with his pattern attended with communication of his strength and enforced with a glorious and free reward to the weakest attempt if sincere to draw thereinWhy then my soul art thou as an unruly  bullock unaccustomed to this yoke  Why so many criminal attempts to shake off the yoke and burst the bands why this resisting of the Lord and struggling to evade his authority Is it not HE who lays my  meat  my  life  my  all  to me The law of ceremonies and  as a covenant of works is a yoke of bondage  the former chained down to burdensome services innumerable and the latter rigorously demands what we can never perform  It is called the LAW OF LIBERTY  Psal ii  To obey it as a rule is the privilege of those only whom God's  c  Jam i  Son hath made  free indeed  The obedience of love to it as a rule springs from our freedom from the law as a covenant and is the very quintessence of our honourable and delightful libertyLord my true freedom from sinful slavery lies in being thy filial subject Truly I am thy servant I am thy servant thou hast loosed my  bands  It is called the ROYAL LAW  Jam ii  Being established by God the universal Sovereign it extends to all his rational subjects nor without high treason can it be broken  It is not made for a righteous man  is not made to curse and condemn him Nor have the truly righteous nation any immediate connection with it  as a covenant  it being dead to them and they to it by Jesus Christ's fulfilling it in their stead  The law of the wise is called a FOUNTAIN  of life  Prov xiii  The DIVine law which every wise man attends to as his rule and the instructions which wise men give to others are means of exciting them to apply to Christ the resurrection and the life means of quickening reviving and restoring spiritual life means of mens escaping the second death and preparing for life eternal  The ceremonial law is called CARNAL  ordinances  and  a  CARNAL  commandment  Heb ix and vii  It prescribed carnal and fleshly rites and carnal or natural descent entitled to the privileges thereof  The ceremonial law is called a PARTITIONWALL  Eph ii  because of the great distinction which it made between the Jews and Gentiles nor till Jesus removed and abolished it by his death was any considerable number of Gentiles brought into the church of God  The ceremonial law is called ENMITY  Eph ii  The sacrifices therein required manifested God's indignation at sin and the enmity between him and sinful men Its burdensome services occasioned the Jews hatred of God to increase more and more The distinction it put between Jews and Gentiles occasioned enmity between the two  II  Metaphors respecting the gospel  The gospel is called the SPIRIT  that giveth life  Cor iii  It contains spiritual blessings and promises It comes from is attended by and is the great means of conveying the Spirit of God to us It effectually penetrates our soul and spirit By it the Holy Ghost quickens dead sinners shews them their way of life by Christ heals their deadly their sinful wounds works a lively faith in their soul to look to and live upon him It is the food that supports the spiritual life the cordial that revives and restores the heart under every drooping circumstance  It is represented as the WHITE HORSE upon which Christ and his people ride  Rev vi and xix  O its purity glory and comeliness By it Jesus proclaims peace to men and subdues them to himself On this in the apostolic age he went forth conquering and in the Millennium he shall go forth more eminently to conquer the hearts of his people Then in accomplishment of and as animated supported and dignified by gospelpromises shall multitudes follow him and promote the destruction of Antichrist  It resembles  Solomon's  CHARIOT  of the wood of Lebanon  Song iii  Being framed by Jesus for the safe the easy and honoured conquest and conveyance of his people to heaven how pure precious glorious fragrant and lasting Its  pillars of silver  are its comely useful and enriching truths and promises Its  bottom of gold  is its substantial and precious foundationtruths or the infinitely precious person of Christ and God in him Its  covering of purple  is the doctrine of justification through Jesus' blood and of the cross endured for his sake Its  inward pavement of love  is the unmatched kindness and mercy of God Father Son and Holy Ghost running through every truth and promise therein contained  Its promises are like LILIES  Song ii and vii  O their pleasantness  glory fragrancy and height How fruitful of everlasting blessings How full of medicinal virtue for the healing of our soul How condescendent and suited to our low our wretched conditionBlessed field of inspiration how these every where abound How they bend their blessed head towards mean debased  earthly sensual devilish  me How they refresh mine eyes and rejoice my heart How rank they smell of Jesus the Lily of the valley And truly as lilies among thorns so are they to my soul amidst her troubles and her created comforts  It is called the GRACE  of God that bringeth salvation  and GREAT SALVATION  Tit ii Heb ii  It flows from discovers and includes the rich free and undeserved favour of God and the blessed fruits thereof It publishes brings near offers and is the means of applying a costly extensive and everlasting salvation to menTrust thyself my soul to this word of his grace fail not of this grace nor receive it in vain let it enter and captivate my heart so shall I never be a root of bitterness bearing gall and wormwood whereby many are defiled  It is called the POWER  of God unto salvation  Rom i  By it God displays his amazing power in the contrivance in the purchase and application of our redemption Thereby he exerts the exceeding greatness of his power in convincing in converting in forgiving sanctifying and comforting his people By means of it our rebellion is quashed our enmity slain Satan dislodged corruption subdued bars of iron and gates of brass strong impediments broken and removed nations reformed men furious as outragious beasts tamed and deeprooted and earnestlyheld abominations abolished Come blessed  day of power  come forth  blessed rod of Jesus' strength  then shall the people be willing God shall raise children out of worse than stones to Abraham Nothing is too hard when his power is present to heal them  It is called the WISDOM  of God in a mystery the manifold  WISDOM  of God  Cor i Eph iii  How  manifold  its doctrines  and promises How manifold the instances and rays of DIVine wisdom in each and the various times and seasons in which and persons to which it is displayed It discovers how wisely JEHOVAH acted in chusing the persons in whose redemption grace would peculiarly shine in founding his choice upon his own mere love that the promises might be sure to all the seed in laying our help upon one that is mighty that it might never fail in bringing about our salvation in a way that produceth glory to himself in the highest peace on earth and good will towards men in a way by which Satan is shamed sin condemned sinners saved the ungodly justified and ungodliness destroyed iniquity forgiven and full vengeance taken on our inventions in a way by which our redemption is all of mercy and all of justice all of merit and all of grace O sweet mystery beyond archangels comprehensive ken  It may be called the KISSES  of Christ's mouth  Song i  From him its doctrines and promises proceed and bear the stamp of his authority How sweetly they attest his peace and reconciliation declare and vent his love How effectually they delight our soul ravish our heart and excite our affection and love to himLet Jesus kiss me with one with all  the kisses of his mouth  apply one apply all his promises to my heart to kindle it wholly into a flame of love to himself  It is called a LAW  Is ii Rev vii and iii  It is the will of a sovereign God proclaiming his edicts of peace and pardon It engageth him to bestow his blessings on us and binds and determines us to receive his grace and obey his commands Nor shall it ever be repealed because Jesus  hath an unchangeable priesthood  It is the  law of the Spirit of life in him  as by it the Holy Ghost as dwelling in sent by and taking of the things of Christ to shew them to us begets preserves restores increaseth and perfects our spiritual life secures us of and prepares us for eternal life It is the  law of faith  the seed the means the ground and standard of our faith  It comes forth out of Zion and Jerusalem  flows from Christ as the temple and habitation of God and from Jerusalem did its NewTestament dispensation proceed  and spread among the GentilesO may I meditate on this law day and night may it be better to me than  thousands of gold and silver  It is called  good  TIDINGS  of great joy  Is iii Luke ii  O the necessary the useful the suitable the important the delightful and ravishing news which it brings from heaven to sinful men Tidings of righteousness pardon and acceptance to the guilty Tidings of purification to the polluted of health to the diseased of liberty to the enslaved and imprisoned of clothing to the naked of food to the hungry and starving of light to them that sit in darkness of distress and ignorance of riches to the poor comfort to the mourner peace to the traitor life to the dead and salvation to the lost How often have these good news from the far country been as cold water to my thirsty and weary soul It is called the  gospel  or  good tidings of God  it proceeds from him declares his love and loveliness promotes his honour and brings men to him It is called the  gospel of Christ  as he is the principal preacher the substance and end of of it in whom all the articles of it are  yea and amen to the glory of God  It is called the  gospel of ministers  as they preach and publish it It is the  gospel of peace  as it proclaims the peace of God to us and the means thereof and reconciles our heart to him and to one another in love It is the  gospel of salvation  as it proclaims brings near offers exhibits and is the means of applying the great the everlasting salvation to our soul It is an  everlasting gospel  as it shall be dispensed till the end of time and its fruits shall remain for ever It is the  gospel of the kingdom  of grace and which brings men who believe it to the kingdom of glory  It is called a MYSTERY  Eph iii Tim iii Matth xiii  O the incomprehensible truths which it reveals That there are three persons in one Godhead or DIVine essence That the Son of God was manifest in the flesh suffered the just for the unjust that he might bring sinners to God died for our offences and rose again for our justification was exalted as a Prince and Saviour to give us repentance and remission of sins sent to bless us make us the  righteousness of God in him and dwell in our hearts by faith that being crucified with Christ we might live by faith on him and have the world crucified to us and we to the world Is not every doctrine thereof an unsearchable deep shown only by the Spirit of God and which even a wise man cannot find out to perfection O the height the depth the length and breadth of the love the wisdom and knowledge of God included therein It is the  mystery of godliness  which founds and promotes conformity to and reverence of God holiness in heart and life The  mystery of the kingdom  known only in the kingdom of grace and glory Pant thou my soul for the fellowship of this mystery of Christ with angels desire to look into it  It is likened to a TRUMPET  Is xxvii  With great skill it ought to be preached How majestic and pleasant its joyful sound its agreeable declarations How sweetly how loud it proclaims the approaches of King Jesus to men and their deliverance from sin and wrath by him Of what unbounded importance are its declarations and how distinct It warns us to flee from the wrath to come invites us to Jesus the  Saviour and great One  Quickly may it be blown over all the earth that such as are ready to perish may come and worship before the Lord of hosts  It is compared to RIVERS  of living and allquickening water  Ezek xlvii Joel iii Zech xiv Psal xlvi  because of its freeness fulness purity perpetuity and patency to all and for its cleansing beautifying protecting refreshing and enriching virtue By it Jesus begets preserves restores promotes and perfects the spiritual life of his people and brings them to eternal life  This river proceeds from the temple and runs by the altar of God  flows from his love and through the blood and sacrifice of his Son  Gradually it increaseth from a bubbling drop to an unpassable sea  Before the flood it was very small in appearance but gradually it increased by new revelations till in the apostolic age it became like a river Before Jesus' resurrection it was inconsiderable in respect of its appearance in the apostolic and millennial age It  runs  into the dead sea and valley of Shittim  spreads among dead and barren Gentile nations and into cursed barren and lifeless hearts It  makes every thing to live whithersoever it cometh  had and shall have an amazing success in quickening dead sinners and reviving dying saints but heals not  marishy places  of reprobate men  The flourishing and fruitful trees growing on the side of this river  are Jesus the tree of life and his comely and useful saints  The multitude of fishers from Engedi even unto Eneglaim and the multitude of fishes caught by them in the dead sea when this river hath run into it  are ministers preaching and multitudes hearing and receiving the gospel through the world from one end to the other Its  running both in summer and winter  implies its being constantly preached and applied whether in times of prosperity or trouble with the church or any particular member thereof It  maketh glad the city  the church  of God  by its  streams  of declarations offers invitations and influences  It is a WELL or  wells of salvation  Is xii  O the depth of its doctrines and promises Without faith I can draw nothing from them O their perpetual fulness of influence of blessedness and salvation How sweetly calculated to delight refresh nourish restore heal quicken and fructify my heart And is not salvation their sum their  all in all  The gospel is compared to a NET  Matth xiii  How curious its frame and contexture How base and despi+cable in the view of carnal men What an occasion of trouble and disturbance in the sea of this world With what skill care and vigour it must be cast and managed in the preaching of it To what fatigue and storms are its constant its faithful preachers exposed How seldom they  at first  perceive their success in preaching it It is the stated means of drawing sinners out of their natural and worldly state to Jesus Christ Fishes small and great sinners less or greater persons poor or rich are caught therein Teach thy ministers O Jesus to cast this net on the right side of the ship that a multitude may be inclosed it is impossible the net can  break Quickly my soul shall JEHOVAH draw it to land the mystery of God shall be finished the gospel no more dispensed Then shall the good fish such men as were caught by the heart be conveyed to the paradise of God These who were only caught by a heady illumination and outward profession shall be cast into endless fire  It is compared to a GRAIN  of mustardseed which grows up into a very large stalk  Matth xiii  At first its discovery and dispensation were small and despised but it hath or will overspread the whole earth To what multitudes is it the means of refreshing and comfort What numbers shall profess subjection to it How increasing its influence in our heart At first perhaps scarce discernible it quickly fills the whole What multitudes of graces are refreshed What good works are brought forth under the overshadowing influence thereof  It is compared to LEAVEN  Matth xiii  However unpleasant and despicable it be to carnal men yet being inlaid in the world it continueth to spread its influence till the whole earth be filled with the knowledge of the Lord Being inlaid in mens heart it spreads its virtue enlightening the mind purifying the conscience renewing the will softening the heart inflaming the affections and fixing the memory till the whole be thereby sanctified  It is compared to LIGHT and a GLASS  Is lx Cor iii  What ravishing though imperfect views of JEHOVAH in his greatness and love of Jesus in his comeliness office relations righteousness power and grace do we here obtain What prospect of life and immortality We look not at the things which are seen which are temporal but at the things which are not seen which are eternal we see that henceforth is laid up for us a crown of righteousness that we shall awake with Jesus' likeness and shall be for ever with and like him for we shall see him as he is  It resembles the TREASURE  hid in the field  Matth xiii  How inestimably precious containing all exceeding great and precious promises comprehending all inestimable  benefits all the unsearchable riches of Christ When possessed how it enricheth felicitates ennobles and emboldens towards God encourageth and enables to resist wicked lusts angels and men  In the field  of inspiration it lieth hid and must be digged up by careful search meditation and prayer And for its sake are the oracles of Heaven worth ten thousand worlds to my heart  It resembles CHAINS OF GOLD ROWS OF JEWELS BORDERS OF GOLD and STUDS OF SILVER  Song i  How well connected how comely precious firm durable enriching and adorning are its doctrines and promises to the scripture and church and to every true member thereof How they strengthen and adorn the neck of my faith render my  cheeks  my countenance my blushing graces beautiful and comely and make my conversationgarments shew splendid and glorious  It is compared to SHOES  Song vii  It supports our soul our grace our walk influenceth our affections marks our liberty and our royal greatness The more fixed we be in the faith thereof the more pleasantly safely and swiftly we proceed in our spiritual journey and tread Satan the old serpent and his agents under our feet  Its leading truths resemble a FOUNDATION  Tim ii  Being fixed on the testimony of God Father Son and Holy Ghost it is impossible that they can sink or fall How gloriously they support and embellish the whole remaining oracles of God And on them build my soul build you saints your whole hopes of eternal felicity  CHAP V  Metaphors respecting the gospeldispensation and ordinances thereof  Metaphors respecting the gospeldispensation  THE dispensation of God's grace especially under the New Testament is called the KINGDOM OF GOD the KINGDOM OF HEAVEN  Mark i and Matth xx  O the majestic sovereignty state and royalty of God therein manifested O its beautiful order strength and duration and the honourable privileges therein conferred What multitudes are thereby connected and united under Jesus their head God is the deviser the establisher the manager and his glory the end of it It is heavenly in its origin it resembles heaven in holiness comeliness and order and prepares men for entrance into the heavenly inheritance of the saints in light The New Testament dispensation is more Godlike and heavenly than the Old holiness is the universal  law of the house  and its privileges are more spiritual and sanctifying  The gospel dispensation in the apostolic age is represented as a MARRIAGEDINNER and that chiefly in the glorious Millennium is called the MARRIAGE SUPPER  of the Lamb  Matth xxii Luke xiv Rev xix Matth viii  The former is indeed towards the end of time but nearer its middle than the other which shall but take place before the last judgment God hath  killed his oxen and satlings  hath slain his own Son to he our provision hath prepared all possible blessings and invites every sort of sinners to espouse his Son and accept of his fulness From trifling and carnal motives the Jews when first invited refused to receive this mercy and favour For this they were excluded from the church and the ordinances thereof themselves massacred by the murdering Romans and by one another and their city burnt with fire But thrice happy God extended his invitations to the destitute the wicked and infamous Gentiles in whatsoever city or nation they are found O now our rich provision our amazing  joy and happiness our honourable fellowship with God Father Son and Holy Ghost with angels ancient patriarchs and eminent saints while the Jewish  children of the kingdom  are cast out How fitly our entertainment prepareth us for our work in the end of the world qualifieth us to lie down in our dusty beds of the grave and to enter into our eternal rest How great JEHOVAH's earnestness to have his house filled with destitute sinners Upon his invitations what multitudes have entered and  yet there is room  By setting before us the sinfulness and misery of our natural state Jesus' excellency ability and readiness to save and using every method to persuade our conscience he requires his ministerial servants  to compel  us to come in that his house may be filled But dreadful shall be our endless misery if we live in his church without putting on his Son as our  righteousness and sanctification  It is represented as the  letting out of a vineyard to husbandmen  Matth xxi  In the ceremonial form thereof God gave it to the Jews and sent his prophets to demand that they should give him the glory due to his name these being injuriously maltreated he sent his Son whom it might have been expected they would reverence and regard but they murdered him that they might live as they listed For these things God miserably destroyed the Jewish nation and gave the gospel to the Gentiles that they might bring forth fruits of good works answerable to it  It is compared to the  hiring of labourers at different hours to work in a vineyard and giving all equal wages  Matth xx  In the morning of the patriarchal in the noontide of the ceremonial at the  ninth hour  of the apostolic age in the  eleventh hour  of the future Millennium or thousand years reign of the saints multitudes are DIVinely invited and brought to Christ and to his work in the church Nor shall the eternal blessedness of the former exceed that of the latter Murmur not ye Jews  who bore the burden  of eremonial rites  and the heat  of laborious service murmur not ye primitive Christians who  bore the burden  of troublesome work and  the heat  of scorching persecution may not JEHOVAH do with  his own as he pleaseth Is not the whole reward of sovereign grace Let not your eye be evil because his is good In the early morning of life are not some in its middle or noon are not others in its evening of old age are not others though more rarely called and drawn to Christ May not a sovereign God impart to all an equal share of his endless bliss his gracious reward  It is compared to a  great man's giving pounds or talents to his servants as he departs to a far country that they may occupy till he return call them to an account and render them rewards according to their respective improvement  Matth xxv Luke xix  Ascending up on high to receive for himself a kingdom Jesus committed to men the precious and useful  pounds  and  talents  of DIVine scriptures of gospel ordinances of manifold opportunities of grace and happiness of holy offices gifts and graces to some in a greater to others in a lesser degree These he requires them to improve  alway abounding in the work of the Lord  At the end he will come and reckon with them Such as having real grace have improven their talents shall be highly and proportionally rewarded with everlasting honour and joy Such as having no real grace through hard thoughts of Jesus have not improved their gifts offices and opportunities shall be selfcondemned and cast into endless misery  In the end of the world it is like to  the calling of wise and foolish virgins to meet the Bridegroom  Matth xxv  Though churchmembers be like virgins in outward purity in blamelessness of life and soundness of principle and in apparent modesty and selfdenial yet alas how many of them are not  wise unto salvation  What multitudes foolishly name the name of Christ without receiving him into their heart At the end of time how dreadful shall be the sloth and security of both saints and hypocrites Ere they are aware Christ shall summon them to judgment Happy then those who have  oil  of true grace attending their lamps of profession their glory shall be brightness their lamps trimmed their grace perfected and themselves shall enter into  immediate and everlasting fellowship with Christ but oh unhappy these who have lamps but no saving grace None can then be given them no creature shall be able or willing to help them They shall be irreversibly excluded from the fellowship of Christ and shut up in everlasting torments where there shall be  weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth  The gospelstate of the NewTestament church is represented as a REST  Heb iv  How fully is our free and complete justification through the blood of Jesus therein displayed and how powerfully applied how happily we are therein liberated from that servile frame of spirit which was so common to the Jews in their worship The yoke of troublesome ceremonies is no more imposed nor is our conscience burdened or perplexed concerning the punctual observance thereof But the spiritual and easy institutions of the gospel attended with gracious freedom strength and assistance are come in their room Blessed rest of heaven blessed form of worship never to be changed in time and wherein JEHOVAH manifests his rest in Christ and in his love towards us  II  Metaphors
