 LETTERS OF LITERATURE  LETTER I  Oct  DEAR SIR  YOU ask me by what means it comes to pass that a rude poetical production of a barbarous age always affects and pleases the heart more than the most finished and artificial effort of a refined composer  TO examine this matter thoroughly might employ much philosophical research I shall only beg leave to lay before you a few remarks which may not perhaps have offered themselves to your enquiries  IN the first place what do you call a barba∣rous age or country To what period of society may this denomination be properly limited The Greeks gave this denomination to the Persians tho the latter were arrived at more refinement of manners than themselves We give it to the Chinese the Chinese with equal propriety to us  BARBARISM like every other human acci∣dent and quality must be allowed to be merely comparative If any one said that most of the European kingdoms had not yet emerged from barbarity nay that the most polished of them are yet but barbarcus every beau of the aera of George I would stroke his chin and smile Yet were all ancient Roman to revisit this globe and make a tour to Paris I have no doubt but he would with great justice affirm that the French were very little improved since his own days that their customs their dress their luxuries were barbarous  au dernier point  I say with justice because from a comparative view of the Roman manners every one must allow that they were in the days of their glory as much superior to the French in luxury which  is always considered as the great criterion of refinement as the French are to the Esquimaux Indians Indeed one cannot help smiling when the declamations of writers and of the clergy in particular against the luxury and refinement of their own several ages are considered In the old English days when the drawingrooms of palaces were carpeted with clean straw and maids of honour breakfasted on roast beef the pulpits shook with virulent invectives against pride of furniture and delicacy of food What more can be said now when forests are robbed of their music for the sake of the rumps of the nightingales What more will be said four centuries after this when I will venture to prophesy luxury and refinement will be in such a state as justly to reflect upon this age the appellation of barbarous  THESE remarks are only made with a view to shew the necessity of defining what is meant by barbaric poetry before the subject is further opened To the poetry of the modern French just as the above observations may be we should no more think of giving the epithet of barba∣rous than to that of the ancient Greeks or Romans  As in youth most people have felt an incli∣nation to write verses tho in a more mature age they have lost that desire so it is in the youth of society if I may so express myself that poetry has most flourished Now this youth of society is commonly like that of man lost in tempestuous passions which call forth extraordinary exertions of mind Such exertions form the very life and soul of poetry Homer was a witness of such emotions as arise in a barbarous state of society ere he recorded them in the Iliad Violent actions and sudden calamities of all kinds are the certain conco∣mitants of uncivilized life to these we owe a poetry warm rapid and impetuous that like a large river swelling from a bleak mountain carries the reader along in the barge of fancy now by vales fragrant with wild flowers now thro woods resounding with untaught me∣lody but most generally thro deserts replete with romantic and with dreadful prospects  SOCIETY always passes through three differ∣ent stages ere it arrives at refinement The first is the mere savage state during which the lord of the world is almost on a level with the  brutes themselves living like them in caves or wretched huts in the woods that saw him born and subsisting on wild fruits and such prey as his rude invention can seize by force or guile Climate has such power over human happiness as sometimes to fix Society in this state without any hope of further progress as for instance in Lapland The poetry of such a country must of course be always barbaric The second stage is that of pastoral life The third may be considered as a kind of middle state between barbarism and civilization and is that in which the shepherds of the second state begin to confederate together for defence of themselves and their flocks against such of their neighbours as are yet in the first condi∣tion and who ignorant of property would admit of no law but force For that effect towns are built and by the collision of differ∣ent minds the arts and sciences begin to be struck out which are in time to spread the light of refinement thro the community  ALL poetry composed in these different pe∣riods of society may with propriety be termed barbaric but more particulary that of the first  and second The Iliad if not written during the third is yet a living picture of its manners and it is to this as much as to any other cir∣cumstance that it owes its wonderful superio∣rity For no state of society can be so interest∣ing as that in which the sun of science is be∣ginning to rise and discover prospects full of splendor and novelty and in which the mind vegetating strongly begins from a vigorous stem to display the buds of elegance  AS in this stage of society poetry may be carried to the highest perfection so the two first do not impede its real influence for what it wants in art in elegance in harmony is fully compensated by a wild force of nature by a simplicity by a pathos to which every heart is in unison attributes no less declarative of the power of poetry than the former Love a passion of every age and climate imparts his tenderness even to the savage breast amid the snows of Lapland as we may perceive from the songs preserved by Scheffer which you so much admire and which may be compared to the roses that grow wild as Mr Maupertuis informs us on the banks of the rivers and lakes of that dreary country  FROM what I have written you will no doubt see that I am still the same sceptic in most matters that you left me thinking al∣ways ways with Sir Roger de Coverley that "much may be said on both sides" so that if you wish to have an opinion on any subject you will be much disappointed if you apply to me but if you desire to hear doubts instead of decisions I may perhaps furnish you with a sufficiency  AS I know your fondness for such pieces of rude poetry as have intrinsic merit I subjoin two that may not perhaps have lain in your way  THE first is extracted from a History of the Canary Islands by Captain Glas and is one of the most exquisite pieces of elegiac poetry which I have ever met with In the year you must know Guillen Peraza an enterprizing youth was Governor of the Canary Islands but attempting to reduce Palma one of them to the power of Spain he was there killed The following verses were made on that occa∣sion and as our author informs us are re∣peated  in Palma to this day which I do not wonder at as every one who hears them must wish to remember them and the heart must be hard indeed that is not affected by their deep pathos There is a bit of a pun however in the second stanza which to understand you must remember that Palma signifies a palmtree As perhaps to use a royal metaphor your Spanish may be rusty I shall subjoin a prose translation as literal as possible  Llorad las damas  Assi Dios os vala  Guillen Peraza  Quedo en la Palma  La flor marchita  De la su cara  No eres Palma  Eres retama  Eres cypres  De triste rama  Eres desdicha  Desdicha mala  Tus campos rompan  Tristes volcanos  No vean plazeres  Sino pesares  Cubran tus flores  Las arenales  Guillen Peraza  Guillen Peraza  Do esta tu escudo  Do esta tu lanza  Todo la acaba  La mala adanza  Let the ladies lament Guillen Peraza as God shall help them  in their miseries  for in Palma the flower left his cheek  Thou  fatal isle  art not Palma  a name significant of victory and joy  thou art a bramble thou art a cypress of melancholy branch thou art a misfor∣tune a dreadful evil  Let dismal volcanos burst thy fields Let no plea∣sures be seen there but sorrows Let sands cover all thy flowers  Guillen Peraza Guillen Peraza Where is thy shield Where is thy spear A fatal rashness de∣stroyed all  THE second has not been published so far as I know It is an Indian song translated by John Nettles a Cataba Indian who learned English at the school founded by Sir Robert Boyle at Williamsburg  I was walking thro the shade of the grove in the morning dew I met my fancy She talked with her smiling lips to me I gave her no answer She told me to speak out my mind Bashful face spoils good intent That cleared up my heart But when my love is gone from my side my heart faints and is low  LETTER II  INdifference for fame is by no means to be regarded as a virtue If desire of praise be a vice it is a vice that is the author of many virtues and we are glad to have rich grain tho we use dung to produce it  AT the same time I perfectly agree with you that common and universal applause is in the eyes of a man of wisdom or even of true taste a matter not to be wished The praise of one fool or knave we should be ashamed of surely then we ought infinitely more to despise that of an innumerable multitude of both If a man has vanity his vanity itself ought to be rather offended than pleased at the incense aris∣ing from the flowers of such weeds even his vanity should have a better taste as Mr Gray expresses it  'Praise' says Lord Bacon  is the reflection of virtue but it is as the glass or body which giveth the reflection If it be from the common people it is commonly false and naught and rather followeth vain persons than virtuous For the common people un∣derstand not many excellent virtues the lowest virtues draw praise from them the middle virtues excite in them astonishment or admiration but of the highest virtues they have no sense or perceiving at all but shews and  species virtutibus similes  serve best with them Certainly fame is like a river that beareth up things light and swollen and drowns things weighty and solid but if per∣sons of quality and judgement concur then it is as the Scripture saith  Nomen bonum instar unguenti fragrantis  It filleth all round about and will not easily away for the odours of ointments are more durable than those of flowers  So far this excellent writer upon whose estimate of fame some illnatured reader may perhaps make this censure that if Lord Bacon had held popular applause in more reverence  he might have had at least one strong motive not to degrade his high office by the acceptance of a bribe It may however be remarked upon the above quotation with more justice that by  persons of quality  the great chancellor must mean persons whose quality lies in their mind not our mob of persons of quality who are most commonly if you will excuse a pun persons of no quality at all  INDIFFERENCE for vulgar fame therefore you will do well to discriminate from indiffe∣rence for genuine praise of the true flavour The former certainly belongs to a mind that can stand upon its own basis without the props of adventitious opinions The latter I will be bold to say is the parent of every vice  What will the world say  is a reflection that has stifled many a bad inclination in the breasts of those who are either above or below every other motive Want of shame and total pro∣fligacy follow like a flood if you remove this bank which excluded them It is true this principle has done as much harm as good in the world a false respect for the opinion of others having destroyed many a virtue because  it did not happen at that time to float upon the stream of fashion Such effect has false fame upon a little mind and the force of the true upon a large soul is yet more strong The praise of the few swells and invigorates it to its most complete perfection at the same time that it shrinks from multitudinous glory  For what is glory but the blaze of fame  The people's praise if always praise unmixt  And that the people but a herd confused  A miscellaneous rabble who extol  Things singular and well weigh'd scarce worth the praise  They praise and they admire they know not what  And know not when but as one leads the other  And what delight to be by such extoll'd  To live upon their tongues and be their talk  Of whom to be despised were no small praise  His lot who dares be singularly good  Milt Par Reg  AN author in particular who has any regard for his fame should beware of building it upon such a sandy foundation as the applause of the mob The popular gale as Horace phrases it is eternally veering but in no clime does it  vary more than in that of literature Fashion after exerting her power upon most other sub∣jects has at last chosen literary reputation to display the utmost caprices of her sway Sometimes it happens wonderfully that she blunders right but most commonly her fa∣vours are unworthily bestowed These fashi∣onable scriblers who are now so common are however by no means to be envied for in the course of a year of a month of a day the public may see the deception and as it hap∣pens when we treat a stranger with respect who we afterwards find deserves our scorn their warmest admirers most frequently revenge the insult they have themselves imposed on their own understandings by commencing their bitterest enemies  THERE is a grievance just now reigning in this capital of which you in the country can scarcely have an idea After being blest with a variety of swindlers in all occupations we have at last got  literary swindlers  people who steal reputation in order to steal money As the character must be new to you I will give you some outlines of it  A LITERARY swindler is a scribler who regards fame as only a road to the temple of wealth of consequence so he can get what is here called reputation he cares not by what means His first step is to form an intimacy with the printers of newspapers of magazines of reviews and other periodical works Thro these channels he gravely communicates to the public what are here emphatically deno∣minated  puffs  or praises of himself and his writings the more bombastic the better Those who know the trick laugh at his effrontery but as they are but few in comparison of the others he minds not their derision The mob who know nothing of the matter stare and wonder they have not heard of such a cele∣brated writer Every one not to appear igno∣rant whether he has read the work  puffed  or not calls it admirable tho were he to trust his own judgement he would call it the silliest nonsense that ever fell from a goose's quill The scribler in the mean time goes on  puffing  as fast as he can writes anecdotes of himself sends letters from the country telling of his being so happy as to be in the company of himself and what a modest and wonderful  man he himself is At length by these and such tricks he gets what is called a reputation and perhaps makes a fortune by it ere the knavery is revealed  No consideration can make a man of reflec∣tion more deaf to popular approbation than the view of such a charmer as the above He will perceive that the fame he pursued as a chaste bride is no better than a common pros∣titute and abandon the suit with scorn and indignation  LETTER III  HAD you perused the work of Vavassor you would cease to wonder at your friend's taking no notice of him in his Essay on Ludicrous Composition His book  De Dic∣tione Ludicra  which you think must abound with curious matter is the most vapid perfor∣mance you can imagine You likeways mis∣take its intention It is written to prove that the ancients either knew nothing of or else despised ludicrous writing and what do you think is the consequence he derives from this discovery which his halflearning enabled him to make Why to be sure that we the poor moderns must not pretend to feast on more luxurious things than our elders and must look on a way of writing unknown to them as forbidden to us  Ah lepidum caput  His book  De Epigrammate  is of the fame stuff The one half of it is filled with invectives truly jesuiti∣cal against some Collector of Epigrams be∣cause as would appear he did not think any  of Vavassor's Epigrams worthy a place in his work However he afterwards gives his an∣tagonist ample revenge by presenting us with his own epigrams in three books among all which there is not one that will bear reading twice or indeed once if one could judge of them at first sight  Such are the works of Vavassor who has written on subjects of elegance without taste and on subjects of curiosity without interesting nay I may add on subjects of erudition with∣out learning  WHAT must we think of an author whose works instead of advancing knowlege would confine it whose arguments if extended prove that we must not use gunpowder because unknown at the battle of Marathon nor printing because Cicero does not mention it  YET such a writer has had his admirers among his countrymen for according to one of their own prophets  Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire  I ENTIRELY agree with you that Bossu and the other French critics whom Addison fol∣lowed with blind adoration cannot be held in too sovereign contempt How mistaken a cri∣tic that fine writer was may merit discussion on another occasion  LETTER IV  AS I know that Akenside's work on the Pleasures of Imagination is deservedly one of your most favorite poems I send you inclosed what I have no doubt you will set a due value on no less than a copy of all the corrections he made with his own hand on that Poem They were inserted in the margin of the Doctor's printed copy which afterwards passed into the hands of a gentleman from a friend of whom and of my own a very inge∣nious young Templar I received them At what time they were written I cannot pretend to say much less to reveal the author's reasons for not giving an edition according to them Most of them are evidently much for the better one or two I am afraid for the worse You will observe that a few of them have been adopted by the author in his proposed alteration of the Poem as appears from the two books and part of the third of that alteration published by Mr Dyson in his edition of Akenside's  Poems to but far the greater part is unpublished and that the mot valuable as being evidently written ere the author had taken up the strange idea that poetry was only perfect oratory So that I will venture to say that an edition of The Pleasures of Imagina∣tion adopting most of these corrections would be the most perfect ever yet known Read and judge  BOOK I  Argument Erase the words  or wonderfulness  and the sentence  Pleasure from novelty or wonderfulness with its final cause  Verse I for  attractive  read  prevailing

in what does its discrimination from other kinds of poetry consist Those who have even pretended to write in this style have often betrayed per∣fect ignorance of the very principles of so ex∣quisite a mode of composition  THE Greeks the Greeks alone my friend are the masters and their works the models of this kind of poetry If we examine these models with care we shall perceive that this species of poetry divides itself in resemblance of the works of nature into two kinds the sublime and the beautiful In the first class Pindar stood without a rival till Gray appeared In the second Anacreon and Sappho still re∣main without equal competitors  FROM these writers therefore the genuine spirit of lyric poetry may be discovered From Pindar we learn that sudden transitions bold and abrupt metaphors a regular cadence and a warm and impetuous glow of thought and language  Thoughts that breathe and words that burn  are essentials of the higher mode of lyric writ∣ing I place a regular cadence among these requisites in spire of Dryden's wonderful ode which is of itself worth all that Pindar has written as a large diamond is worth a vast heap of gold because that masterpiece is a dithyrambic poem not a lyric one And that as well for its want of regularity as for  ts subject which being perfectly convivial as its title speaks falls with much propriety into that class which the ancients called dithyram∣bic and which were most commonly sacred to Bacchus  IN the second division of lyric poetry the essentials are less easily fixed Harmony of cadence and beauty and warmth of sentiment passion and expression seem the principal Above all uncommon elegance in turns of  language and in transition are so vital to this kind of lyric poetry in particular that I will venture to say they constitute its very soul a particular that none of our lyric writers before Gray at all attended to His mode of expres∣sion is truly lyrical and has a classic brevity and terseness formerly unknown in English save to Milton alone Of which to produce a few instances from his very first Ode  purple year  for  flowers of Spring insect youth  for  young insects honied spring  for  honey of spring liquid noon  for  liquid air of noon  with many others are all modes of expression of the genuine and uncommon lyric hue  HUME has well observed in his Essay on Simplicity and Resinement that  no criticism can be instructive which descends not to particulars and is not full of examples and illustrations  It may be added to this very just remark that the more minute criticism is the more need it has of example to give a kind of body to its evanescence For this reason since I have spoken of transition as so material a form of the ode I shall beg leave to consider a moment one of the best in any language with  regard to this beauty in particular namely Dr Beattie's Ode on Lord Hay's birthday a pro∣duction which that supreme judge of lyric poetry Mr Gray praises with great justice for the lyric texture of the thoughts  THE opening of this fine piece is however unhappy  A Muse  for  a poet  is a violent and bad metaphor The Muse in any good modern writer only means  Poesy  personified by another name  A Muse unstained  is worse Unstained is an inelegant epithet even when applied in its proper sense to garments c as it gives an idea that they might have been stained  Un∣stained with art  is a mixed metaphor one of the worst faults of composition but leaving those painful remarks these lines  No gaudy wreath of flowers she weaves  But twines with oak the laurel leaves  Thy cradle to adorn  are exquisite the civic crown being of oak the victor's of laurel The image is beautiful to a degree of lyric perfection But observe the transition to the next stanza and pro∣nounce it truly lyric  For not on beds of gaudy flowers  Thine ancestors reclined c  This transition in prose were ridiculous for what connexion between not giving a child a wreath of flowers and the reason assigned namely because his ancestors did not recline on them Yet this want of connexion forms the beauty of this very lyric transition  THE next 'To hurl the dart' c may be called a transition  from  a distance as the last was  to  a distance It is equally classic with the former  IN the th stanza the Muse is as happily introduced as she was unhappily brought in at first It would require too much length to display the rest of the transitions in this ode which are all of them fine but none more so than that in this stanza 'Yon castle's glitter∣ing towers' c which brings the very object before your eyes  As such microscopic parts of criticism are rather fatiguing to the mental eye I shall here conclude with assuring you tho perhaps with a lyric transition in prose that I am very truly c  LETTER VI  I AGREE with you that the life of the latter Cato would if executed with a pen worthy of it prove one of the noblest pieces of biography extant not to mention the public benefit that might be derived from it in these our evil days days in which a remote found of the applause reaped by patriot virtue has hardly reached our ears  OF all the great characters of antiquity few equal none exceed that of Cato The vast∣ness the force of his mind are only to be rivalled by its regular consistency a consist∣ency that makes all his a actions appear of a piece a beauty if I may so express myself rarely to be observed in the portraits of heroes many of whom seem to have fallen as short of common exertion in some passages of their lives as they exceeded it in others How little how mean how trifling the character of Cicero when opposed to such a model The very first storm of public outrage tore his feeble  patriotism up by the roots while the strong virtue of Cato like a mountain oak received fresh vigor from the utmost rage of the tem∣pest  THEY who peruse the Familiar Letters of Cicero will find that orator malapert and vari∣ous as he is uniform in his respect and almost adoration of Cato Such was the power of real dignity of mind over fancy and loquacious eloquence These letters are enriched by the preservation of one of Cato being the only composition of his that has reached us and which shews us clearly that his soul solid as diamond was brightened with politeness Even friendship that greatest snare of a lofty mind could not influence him against the consistent plan of his virtue yet his refusal to act against his real sentiments has nothing harsh but is given at the same time with a firmness that leaves nothing to hope and with a mildness that leaves nothing to censure  SPIRIT of Cato what must be thy indigna∣tion if thou perceivest the degeneracy of a country in which Hampden lied Russel have bled  IT is remarkable that three of the best Roman poets have as it were vied with each other who should most elevate the character of Cato Virgil and Horace tho the minions of a court whose frame was cemented with the blood of that patriot have almost excelled their common expression in his praise The first in the Eneid where his hero finds Cato in Elysium giving laws to the good  His dantem jura Catonem  The second in his odes  Et cuncta terrarum subacta  Praeter atrocem animum Catonis  But Lucan above all has risen to the actual sublime fired by the contemplation of that sublime character  Victrix causa deis placuit sed vita Catoni  To which of the poets is the preeminence due Virgil's praise is wonderfully fine at first sight for how good how just how virtuous must he be who is qualified to give laws to the good to the just to the virtuous in Ely∣sium itself But like the other beauties of this writer it will not bear a close examination  For what laws are to operate among the bles∣sed where there can be no punishment nor reward How can they receive laws who are emancipated from all possibility of crime The praise is therefore futile and ridiculous nothing being more absurd than to erect a column of apparent sublimity upon the morass of false∣hood  THE praise of Horace has great truth and dignity Every thing on earth in subjection to Caesar save the mind of Cato is a great a vast thought and would even arise to the sublime were it not for that of Lucan which exceeds it and nothing can be sublime to which a superior conception may be found  THE praise of Lucan is sublimity itself for no human idea can go beyond it Cato is set in opposition to the gods themselves nay is made superior in justice tho not in power Now the power of the pagan deities may be called their extrinsic justice their intrinsic vir∣tue Cato excelled them says Lucan in real virtue tho their adventitious attribute of power admitted no rival  LETTER VII  YOUR opinion of the comedy of Le Mechant I heartily subscribe to tho Mr Gray has pronounced it the best comedy he ever read It is perfectly in the style of the French tragedy inactive and declamatory Yet I do not wonder at Mr Gray's favourable opinion of it when he admired the silly decla∣mation of Racine so much as to begin a tra∣gedy in his very manner which however he was so fortunate as not to go thro with  OUR stage thank heaven refuses the insipi∣dity of the French drama and requires an action a business a vigor to which the run of Gerontes and Damons which all their come∣dies are stuffed with are mere strangers Mo∣liere in attempting to introduce laughter into the French comedy has blundered upon mere farce for it is the character of that nation always to be in extremes In short if w  except Fontaine I know of no writer in the  French language who has real claim to poeti∣cal merit Their language is not the language of verse nor are their thoughts or their  costume  those of poetry Fontaine uses their language familiarly in which way only it can be used to advantage His thoughts are like∣wise in the style of mere familiar humour Comic tales may be well written in French but nothing else Their prose writers I readily allow yield to none in the world but of their poetry the bon mot said by one of themselves to Voltaire which was  Les Franccedilois n'ont pas la tete epique  may be with great justice enlarged thus LES FRANCcedilOIS N'ONT PAS LA TETE POETIQUE  IN English comedy Congreve I believe stands without a rival His plots have great depth and art perhaps too much his charac∣ters are new and strong his wit genuine and so exuberant that it has been alleged as his only fault that he makes all his characters inherit his own wit Yet this fault will not be imputed by adepts who know that the dialogue of our comedy cannot possibly be too spirited and epigrammatic for it requires lan∣guage as well as characters stronger than nature  SHAKSPERE excells in the strength of his characters and in wit but as plot must be re∣garded as an essential of good comedy he must not be erected as a model in the comic acade∣my a loss sufficiently compensated by the re∣flection that it were vain to place him as a model whose beauties transcend all imitation  TRAGEDY and Comedy both ought cer∣tainly to approach as near the truth of life as possible in so much that we may imagine we are placed with Le Diable Boiteux on the roof of the house and perceive what passes within This rule in Tragedy cannot be too strictly observed tho it has escaped almost every writer of modern Tragedy the characters of which speak similies bombast and every thing except the language of real life so that we are eter∣nally tempted to exclaim as Falstaff does to Pistol 'Pr'ythee speak like a man of this world'  In comedy this rule ought by no means to be adhered to as insipidity is the worst fault writing can have but particularly comedy whose chief quality it is to be poignant Now poignancy cannot be effected without strong character but an excellent tragedy may be  written without a strong character in it witness Douglas The characters of Tragedy therefore cannot have too much truth but those of Co∣medy ought to resemble the painted scenes which if examined too nearly are mere daub∣ings but at a proper distance have the very truth of nature while the beauties of more delicate paintings would not be perceived  SENTIMENTAL Comedy as it is called tho of late birth in England is yet the comedy of Menander and of Terence Terence is quite full of sentiment and of a tenderness which accompanies it and so barren of wit and hu∣mour that I only remember two passages in its fix comedies that provoke a smile for a smile is all they can provoke The one is that scene which passes after the eunuch is supposed to have ravished a young lady This is the only proof of the humour of Terence and the only sample of his wit we have in the reply of an old miser to one who he expected brought him tidings of a legacy but who instead thereof makes very gravely a moral observa∣tion to the impatient old man who peevishly retorts "What hast thou brought nothing  here but one maxim"  SENTIMENTAL Comedy bore a very short sway in England Indeed it was incompatible with the humour of an English audience who go to a comedy to laugh and not to cry It was even more absurd it may be added in its faults than that of which Congreve is the model for sentiments were spoken by every character in the piece whereas one sentimental character was surely enough If a man met with his mistress or left her if he was suddenly fa∣voured by fortune or suddenly the object of her hatred if he was drunk or married he spoke a sentiment if a lady was angry or pleased in love or out of it a prude or a coquet make room for a sentiment If a ser∣vant girl was chid or received a present from her mistress if a valet received a purse or a horsewhipping good heavens what a fine sen∣timent  THIS fault I say was infinitely more absurd than that of Congreve for a peasant may blunder on wit to whose mind sentiment is totally heterogeneous Besides Congreve's wi  is all his own whereas most of the said senti∣ments may be found in the Proverbs of Solo∣mon  No wonder then this way of writing was soon abandoned even by him who was its chief leader Goldsmith in vain tried to stem the torrent by opposing a barrier of low humour and dullness and absurdity more dull and ab∣surd than English sentimental Comedy itself  IT is very much to the credit of that excel∣lent writer Mr Colman that while other dra∣matists were lost in the fashion of sentiment his comedies always present the happiest medi∣um of nature without either affectation of sentiment or affectation of wit That the able translator of Terence should yet have sufficient force of mind to keep his own pieces clear of the declamatory dullness of that ancient is certainly a matter deserving of much applause The Jealous Wife and the Clandestine Mar∣riage with others of his numerous dramas may be mentioned as the most perfect models of comedy we have to all the other requisites of fine comic writing they always add just as much sentiment and wit as does them good This happy medium is the most difficult to hit in all composition and most declares the hand of a master  BY the School for Scandal the style of Congreve was again brought into fashion and sentiment made way for wit and delicate hu∣mour That piece has indeed the beauties of Congreve's comedies without their faults its plot is deeply enough perplexed without forc∣ing one to labour to unravel it its incidents sufficient without being too numerous its wit pure its situations truly dramatic The cha∣racters however are not quite so strong as Con∣greve's which may be regarded as the princi∣pal fault of this excellent piece Lesser faults are Charles's sometimes blundering upon sen∣timents nay sometimes upon what are the worst of all sentiments such as are of dan∣gerous tendency as when Rowley advises him to pay his debts before he makes a very libe∣ral present and so to act as an honest man ere he acts as a generous one  Rowley  Ah Sir I wish you would remember the proverb  Charles  Be just before you are generous Why so I would if I could but Justice is an old lame hobbling beldame and I can't get her to keep pace with Generosity for the soul of me  This sentiment than which nothing can be more false and immoral is always received by the silly audience with loud applause whereas no reprobation can be too severe for it A lesser blemish lies in the verses tagged to the end of the play in which one of the characters ad∣dresses the audience The verses are an absur∣dity the address still greater for the audi∣ence is by no good actor supposed to be pre∣sent and any circumstance that contributes to destroy the apparent reality of theatrical repre∣sentation cannot meet with too sharp censure But it gives me pain to remark any faults in a piece that in general so well merits the ap∣plause it constantly receives I shall only ob∣serve that the sentiment put into Charles's mouth in the last scene tho not liable to the objections brought against the former is yet incompatible with the character which is set in strongest opposition to the sentimental one of Joseph The words I mean are  If I don't appear mortified at the exposure of my follies it is because I feel at this moment the warmest satisfaction at seeing you my liberal benefactor  IT may be observed that every thing like a sentiment is sure to meet with applause on our theatre which the actors well express by call∣ing sentiments  claptraps  This trick of secur∣ing applause by sentiments lately proved the salvation of the very worst tragedy that ever appeared on any stage for the audience had so much applauded the two first acts from the number of those  claptraps  that they were ashamed to retract so that the piece took a little run very quietly to the disgrace of our taste it being one of those very farragos of nonsense that The Rehearsal was written to expose to due scorn and had it been fabricated before the aera of that witty performance it would certainly have had the honour of being placed in the first shelf of absurdity  LETTER VIII  HOW can you treat Petrarch with so much contempt Tho I agree with you that there is a tedious sameness in most of his compositions yet I by no means think him without his merit The very idea indeed of reading upwards of three hundred sonnets gives pain the stated form and measure of that kind of poetry being so disgustingly similar that I believe no man of genius would now write twenty in a life time Yet it has its beauties and tho your comparison of a desert of sand where the same objects always meet the eye were allowed in speaking of Petrarch never∣theless in travelling that desert you will now and then at great intervals I confess light on a spring surrounded with verdure and flowers In his own country I suppose the purity of his language and his antiquity secure his fame independent of his poetical beauties which are not many  I ALSO grant you that he abounds with false beauties among which the most gross and disgusting is his playing on the name of his mistress which unhappily signified a laurel tree in every other line but I cannot assent to your proposition that a writer of real genius may be in a fault but can never happen on a false beauty Shakspere has many false beau∣ties and so has Milton  IT is amazing that a writer who in some passages discovers great force of mind should so utterly lose himself in the unnatural meta∣physics of love Yet by a singular fate it is to his weakness that he owes his fame for his platonic passion threw such a fairy light round himself and his writings as rendered them very conspicuous in these dark times But in some of his Odes or Canzoni he proves him∣self not wholly undeserving of his fame at this day witness the Vth in which there are beau∣ties of the highest kind as in this stanza  Una parte del mondo è che si giace  Mai sempre in ghiaccio ed in gelate nevi  Tutta luntana del cammin del sole  La so  to i giorai nubilosi e brevi  Nemica naturalenente di pace  Nasce una gente a cui'l morir non dole  Questa se piu devota the non soli  Col Tedesco furor la spada cigne  Turchi Arabi e Caldei  Con tutti quei the speran negli dei  Di qua dal mar the fa l'onde sanguigne  Quanto sian de prezzar conoscer dei  Popolo ignudo paventoso e lento  Che ferro mai non strigne  Ma tutti colpi suoi commette al vento  and in these lines of the same ode  Pon mente al temerario ardir di Serse  Che fece per calcar i nostri liti  Di novi ponti oltraggio alla marina  E vedrai nella morte de mariti  Tutte vestiti a brun le donne Perse  E tinto in rosso it mar di Salamina  E non pur questa misera ruina  Del popolo infelice del Oriente  Vittoria ten promette  Ma Maratona e le mortali stratte  Che difese il leon con poca gente  In Canzone XXIX this stanza is eminently beautiful  Voi cui Fortuna ha posto in mano il freno  Delle belle contrade  Di che nulla pieta par che vi stringa  Che fan qui tante pelligrine spade  Perchè 'l verde terreno  Del barbarico sangue si dipinga  Vano error vi lusinga  Poco vedete e parvi veder molto  Che'n cor venale amor cercate o fede  Qual piu gente possede  Colui e piu da' suoi nemici avvolto  O diluvio raccolto  Di che deferti strani  Per innondar i nostri dolci campi  Se dalle proprie mani  Questo n'avven or chi fia the ne scampi  His sonnets truly fine and in which the train of thought varies might be reduced to about a dozen The real poetical beauties of Dante might likewise fall into very small compass consisting chiefly of the celebrated tale of Ugolino and of that in the close of the Vth Canto of the Inferno which is as exquisite for tenderness as the other is remarkable for terror Now that beauties of writers are fashionable reading a small duodecimo extracted from these two poets would if performed with taste be an acceptable present to the public for no  works I have read afford so fair a field for se∣lection as those of the fathers of Italian poetry as they contain diamonds of the finest water lost in a mass of common soil Yet were they both men of real genius for superlative genius must be discovered from the amazing height it sometimes rises to tho at other times it dis∣plays no extraordinary vigor The genius of Petrarch is however more equal and correct than that of Dante yet he by no means wanted strength when he chose to exert it Nor was Dante whose excellence is native force defi∣cient in describing the tender passions as may be seen in the Canto above referred to Pe∣trarch's learning almost destroyed his genius Dante's genius shot freely having no bound of erudition to confine its vigor he is a bold ori∣ginal writer whose beauties are peculiarly his own while his faults are those of the times  LETTER IX  PERHAPS no question of criticism may afford room for more curious investigation than this  In what quality does the perpetual and universal excellence of writing consist  or in other words  What property of composition is certain to procure it the classic and legitimate admiration of all ages and countries  To decide on this point it is certainly the surest method to judge of the future by the past and to pronounce that the same perfec∣tions which have secured to an author of three thousand years standing his due applause will most infallibly effect the same end to a modern writer  A POET of fine talents but of far superior taste has pronounced wisdom or good sense to be the very of fountain of perfect composition  Scribendi recte sapere est et principium et fons  And this maxim will be found to hold true in every species of writing whatever Good sense may be called the salt that preserves the other qualities of writing from corruption This property is alike required in every branch of the belles lettres but there are others which may be considered as confined to one particular path of writing  SUCH is imaginary invention with respect to poetry I say imaginary invention to distin∣guish it here from that scientific invention which belongs to the judgment This inven∣tion as the parent of novelty is the superlative qualification of poetry and nothing can contri∣bute more to procure it permanent admiration Yet invention itself is inferior to strong sense even in poetry for there are poems in which the invention is rich yet disgusts by its futility not being conducted by that  acer animi vis  that keen force of mind which always accompanies true genius  IF good sense is therefore a praise superior to invention itself in poetry we may with great safety pronounce it one of the very first quali∣ties that ensures applause to composition  A BEAUTIFUL work of genius may be aptly compared to a beautiful woman Good sense may be called its health without which it cannot live charming as its other powers may be But tho a woman has good health it does not follow that she is fair nay we often ap∣plaud a  morbidezza  or an appearance of sickly delicacy as an improver of female beauty and in this the comparison fails A works as well as its present parallel must have the bloom and the features of beauty with grace and elegance in its motions to attract admiration The bloom and fine features the grace and elegance of a work consist in its style which is the part that is most recommendatory of it as outward beauty and grace are of a woman considered as an object of sight  THE bloom and the features of composition lie in the verbage and figures of its style the grace in the manner and movement of that style  A work immoral and unwise has yet been found to live by its style in spite of these de∣fects Style is therefore a quality of writing  equal if not superior to good sense for the latter without the former will by no means preserve a work tho the reverse of the rule is true Indeed a fine style is commonly joined with good sense both being the offspring of the same luminous mind  CAN a work live long which is defective in style Impossible Homer's style is the richest in the Greek language Style has preserved Herodotus in spite of his absurdities Every ancient who has reached us has an eminent style in his respective walk and manner Style has saved all the Latin writers who are only good imitators of the Greeks Terence is only the translator of Menander Sallust an imitator of Thucydides Horace is an imitator and al∣most a translator in all his odes as we may boldly pronounce on comparing them with such very minute fragments of Grecian lyric poetry as have reached us Yet it was he who exclaimed  O imitatores servum pecus  Style has saved Virgil entirely who has not the most distant pretence to any other attribute of a poet  GOOD sense I have called the health of a work without which it cannot live but a work may live without much applause and the first quality of writing that attracts univer∣sal and permanent fame was the subject of the present discussion This we have found to be STYLE  LETTER X  TO your observations on the barbarism of some modern customs may be added those which arise from the following lines of Juvenal in his thirteenth satire  Coerula quis stupuit Germani lumina flavam  Caesariem madido torquentem cornua cirro  Who would have thought that our sidecurls and frizzled toupee had such antiquity but along with that such barbarism as to be the fashion of the Germans ere they left their native woods Tacitus in his excellent book of the manners of the Germans mentions their twist∣ing their locks into horns and rings as he calls them It is curious to observe that a custom invented in the most barbarous times should again be brought into vogue at the most polite period  WE see that both Juvenal and Tacitus have chanced on the same appellation in mentioning this strange piece of dress the curls bearing indeed a very strong resemblance to the horns of animals Happy Germans will some mo∣dern husbands be tempted to cry whose horns were only of hair How would Juvenal stare if he came into a modern assembly and saw every man in the company have his horns  non sine cauda  PERHAPS it has escaped you that the invention of hairpowder did not arise in the country of the  plica Polonica  as some malicious antiquaries affirm Fauchet in his  Antiquités Gaulloises  tells us that the kings of the Merovingian race were in use to powder the hair of their heads and beards with gold dust an extravagance to which our beaux and belles may arrive in time  FASHIONS may be laughed at but must be followed to avoid greater evils  LETTER XI  I TOTALLY controvert your opinion that our language has arrived at its highest pitch of refinement so far from that I know of no writer before Gray whose works are of classic correctness except Milton  HUME I remember tells us very gravely that the language of Pope is too much refined as the language of some other writer whom he names is too little so but he gives Parnell as a standard author between the two extremes This distinction is truly ridiculous and worthy of a critic of the French school for it has unluckily been discovered that Pope improved the language of almost every line of Parnell so that he is almost as much the author of Par∣nell's poems as Parnell himself  BY refinement here I mean a manner of writing more pure and of more exquisite figures than the run of even good composition Milton's poetry is almost universally such but far less equally than that of Gray who uses not a single word without a due value being stamped on it This is classic refinement in which not one word one syllable is superflu∣ous or improper  POPE'S works are superabundant with super∣fluous and unmeaning verbage his translations are even replete with tautology a fault which is to refinement as midnight is to noon day What is truly surprizing is that the fourth book of the Dunciad his last publication is more full of redundancy and incorrectness than his Pastorals which are his first  BUT of any works which have obtained considerable applause Thomson's poem of The Seasons is the most incorrect Any reader who understands grammar and classic composi∣tion is disgusted in every page of that poem by faults which tho in themselves minute yet to a refined eye hide and obscure every  beauty however great as a very small inter∣vening object will intercept the view of the sun This reason makes me very much suspect the fame of the Seasons will not be of long existence for I know of no work that has inherited long reputation which is deficient in style as the Seasons undoubtedly are to a most remarkable degree The fact is that the poem on which the future celebrity of Thomson will be founded is by a strange fatality almost to∣tally neglected at this day That is his Castle of Indolence a poem which has higher beauties than the Seasons without any of the faults which disgrace that work tho the conclusion even of this is most absurd and unhappy and could never have occurred to a writer of taste except in a frightful dream  BY the bye Mr Gray has closely imitated a stanza or two of the Castle of Indolence in his Elegy as you will judge from comparing he exquisite description of the manner in which the poet is supposed to pass his time  Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn c  with these lines of Thomson not less exquisite  Of all the gentle tenants of the place  There was a man of special grave remark  A certain tender gloom o'erspread his face  Pensive not sad in thought involv'd not dark  As sweet this man could sing as morning lark  And teach the noblest morals of the heart  But these his talents were yburied stark  Of the fine stores he nothing would impart  Which or boon Nature gave or naturepainting Art  To noontide shades incontinent he ran  Where purls the brook with sleep inviting sound  Or when Dan Sol to slope his wheels began  Amid the broom he bask'd him on the ground  Where the wild thyme and camomoil are found  There would he linger till the latest ray  Of light sate trembling on the welkin's bound  Then homeward thro the twilight shadows stray  Sauntering and slow so had he palled many a day  WHEN I speak of refinement as a perfection of writing you must observe I by no means recommend an affected and foolish refinement such as that of the Spanish poets than which the most gross want of correctness is more al∣lowable The refinement I would applaud is such as is truly classic such as we admire in  the superior Greek and Roman authors such a refinement as is perfectly compatible with an elegant simplicity for you must observe my friend that the simplicity of the ancients is a refined simplicity The purity of their lan∣guage and that of every good writer resembles that of wine which requires labour and time to effect not that of water which is common and of no price  LETTER XII  AMMIANUS MARCELLINUS informs us of an observation which Hormisdas a prince of Persia made on Rome and which is something remarkable namely  That one thing only had there pleased him to find that men died at Rome as well as elsewhere  MR GIBBON in his History has told us to read  displicuisse  for  placuisse displeased  for  pleased  a correction to which those of Bentley are in∣nocent He says the contrary sense would be that of a misanthrope whereas his affords a reproof of Roman vanity  THE sense that strikes me is very different from either of these and is this that the prince's envy at the pleasures of the inhabi∣tants of Rome could only be moderated by the reflection that their pleasures were transitory  How would the miserable envy the happy were not the grave the equal termination of pleasure and of pain  LETTER XIII  YOUR character of our deceased friend is undoubtedly just The goodness of his heart atoned even for the prejudices and ca∣price of his head  FOR what defects will not benevolence atone Is not that virtue superior to every qualification Must not genius itself  hide its diminished head  before the superior splendor of humble and uncelebrated worth  How contemptible do the brightest pursuits of fame appear when opposed to the modest merit of doing good to mankind How much sweeter are the soft whispers of gratitude than the loudest plaudits of popular praise  THERE is not surely a consideration that can be more productive of contempt of fame in a virtuous mind than this that the mad∣man who ravages kingdoms and puts whole nations to the sword is looked on as a deity while he who rewards industry and relieves distress lives without renown and dies without pity  To real goodness my friend even the praise of real and innocent greatness which is that of the mind must yield for there is certainly more genuine merit in doing one good action than in writing an Iliad  LETTER XIV  AN opinion that is opposite to virtue is always opposite to truth This maxim which tho expressed in few words is the fruit of much observation I have in no case found more applicable than in that most absurd po∣pular error that extravagance and inattention to oeconomy always accompany genius  WE all flatter ourselves in our youth espe∣cially that we are possest of that nondescript jewel called genius Indeed if the term genius have so extensive a meaning as to imply capa∣city in general or  capability  as Brown the ce∣lebrated layerout of grounds used the phrase we cannot deny that every one has genius of one kind or another A man may if you will have a very fine genius for stupidity a sort of genius which tho I have not observed to be mentioned in any treatise on the subject is yet at this day the most lucrative species of genius one can be possest of  GENIUS is in my estimation a word of inef∣fable reverence The Gnostic  Abraxas  itself is not to be weighed with it Sometimes one man of genius rises in the space of one thou∣sand years only sometimes indeed when na∣ture is unusually rich three or four will appear in one country in the course of a century as was the case when Bacon Cromwell Milton Newton illuminated England together or at short successions But now good heaven every man every woman every child has genius I will venture to prophesy that in the year from a natural progression of the word genius will imply folly The fact is I have met with no man who in describing genius did not tacitly paint himself  BUT to discuss the opinion mentioned in the beginning of this letter we shall for the pre∣sent consider genius in the popular sense as merely opposed to want of capacity for any art or science and allow that middling quality which we imply when we call a person or  work  ingenious  to fall under the grand class of GENIUS Even allowing this we must still to form a proper judgment reason from the  most high and perfect form in which genius appears as a chemist would not I imagine display the specific gravity of gold from that which is beat out to an inconceivable thinness and exility for gilding but from a solid mass of that metal  IF we examine therefore the conduct of such men as all the world allows to have been endued with superlative genius we shall per∣ceive that so far from being universally curst with inattention to oeconomy we shall perhaps not find one example of want of that virtue among them Of Homer we know nothing certain and to build arguments upon fable is to write on sand Pindar tho extravagance it∣self in his writings yet was prudent enough to acquire great wealth by the sale of them and what is more to keep that wealth and use it with discretion A French writer has wittily put it as the strongest proof of Pindar's genius that he sold his writings well to those who could not understand a line of them  Findare etoit homme d'esprit  En faut il d'autres temoignages  Profond dans tout ce qu'il ecrit  Pindare etoit homme d'esprit  A qui jamais rien n'y comprit  Il sut bien vendre ses ouvrages  Pindare etoit homme d'esprit  En faut il d'autres temoignages  Anacreon's luxury the ancients agree lay more in his writings than in his life In short of all the Greek poets I remember none who is branded with extravagance much less any of their historians or philosophers  AMONG the Romans with whom it may be questioned if literary or scientific genius ever existed as I remember few writers in the Latin tongue who are original or who in other words had a superlative genius yet we shall find that their  ingenious men  if you will laboured under no stain of dissipation To mention their firstrate writers Tacitus and others as men who paid the strictest attention to propriety were superfluous Catullus one of their most licentious poets was yet no de∣bauchee in his life if we may judge from his own deposition  Nam castum esse decet pium poetam  Ipsum versiculos nihil necesse est  A sentence that surely would not have dropt from his pen did his own manners contradict it as we may always observe that writers adapt their words to their actions not their actions to their words  IF we come now to our own country we shall find that genius has always been attended with oeconomy Chaucer acquired wealth by his genius and left it perfect to his heirs so did Shakspere Bacon it must be confessed may be urged on the other side of the question but the dissipation of his wealth was owing to no habit of extravagance on his part but to his indulgence to his servants and to absence of mind Milton out of his shattered fortune found means from strict oeconomy to leave a comfortable subsistence to his wife and family Newton's decency of life is well known To conclude with Pope who indeed can only rank with  ingenious men  he amassed a considerable fortune which he used with the strictest oeco∣nomy and propriety A conduct which how∣ever does not atone for his always mentioning  in his poems poverty as matter of reproach to others and thus eternally blaspheming the Providence that had made him rich  THIS leads me to observe by the bye the falsity of another popular opinion which is that poetry and poverty are as nearly related in fact as in sound 'As poor as a poet' is almost a proverb and took its rise from the itinerant minstrels who in former times were poets by real profession or by trade But few seem to know that no bard of classic days has reached us whom we do not know to have been moderately rich except Homer who for aught certain may have been a petty king just as likely as a beggar and that modern times afford no real poets who were poor except Spenser and Tasso Even with regard to the first of these we have no proof and the po∣verty of the latter was that of a man of high birth not of a mendicant  LETTER XV  I DO not wonder that your search after Bishop Hall's Satires has failed of success for perhaps there are few books in the lan∣guage which are more uncommon After reading that Pope upon their being shewn him when he was far advanced in life ex∣pressed great applause of them and much regret that he had not chanced to see them sooner I do not wonder at your eagerness on this head which in some measure to gratify I send you extracts of his most shining passages  THE work opens with a kind of poetical preface called A Defiance to Envy the three first lines of which are much in the spirit of our author's great cotemporary Shakspere  Nay let the prouder pines of Ida feare  The sudden fires of heaven and decline  Their yielding tops that dared the skies whilere  This couplet in the Prologue to the First Book is strong  Whence damned vice is shrouded quite from shame  And crown'd with virtue's meed immortal name  In Satire I speaking of bad poetry he says  Or let it never live or timely die  In which and many of the lines after quoted you will be surprized to find a smoothness and strength not unworthy of Pope  Now toss they bowls of Bacchus' boiling blood  Sat II  Bacchus' boiling blood  were in the mouth of an ancient Greek or Roman writer an exquisite phrase for  wine  but you know I declare war against the whole crew of heathen deities in modern verse  THE following lines in Sat IV are worthy of Horace  Painters and poets hold your auncient right  Write what you will and write not what you might  Their limits be their list their reason will  But if some painter in presuming skill  Should paint the stars in center of the earth  Could ye forbear some smiles and taunting mirth  In this couplet of Sat VI there seems even an attempt to make the sound correspond with the sense  The nimble dactyl striving to outgo  The drawling spondees pacing it below  In Sat VII shewing the folly of publishing verses on a mistress designed for a wife he wittily exclaims  Fond Witwal that wouldst load thy witless head  With timely horns before thy bridal bed  Satire VIII I transcribe entire for the sake of its fine vein of irony It is against some mise∣rable poem called St Peter's Complaint writ∣ten by a Robert Southwell  Hence ye profane mell not with holy things  That Sion's muse from Palestina brings  Parnassus is transform'd to Sion hill  And iv'ry palms her steep ascents done fill  Now good St Peter weeps pure Helicon  And both the Marias make a music moan  Yea and the prophet of the heavenly lyre  Great Solomon sings in the English quire  And is become a newfound sonnatist  Singing his love the holy spouse of Christ  Like as she were some lightskirts of the rest  In mightiest inkhornisms he can thither wrest  Ye Sion muses shall by my dear will  For this your zeal and faradmired skill  Be straight transported from Jerusalem  Unto the holy house of Bethlehem  'Mightiest inkhornisms' is a phrase of much felicity to express that sort of writing in which ink alone is expended  THIS couplet of the last Satire of this First Book is again much in Pope's manner  But arts of whoring stories of the stews  Ye Muses will ye hear and may refuse  Of Sat II Book II these lines are fine  Fond fool six feet shall serve for all thy store  And he that cares for most shall find no more  I believe the last line of these in Sat III is imitated by Milton  Each homebred science percheth in the chaire  While sacred arts grovell on the groundsell bare  Sat VI of this book its merit and its brevity will justify my transcribing entire  A gentle squire would gladly entertaine  Into his house some trencharchaplaine  Some willing man that might instruct his sons  And that would stand to good conditions  First that he lye upon the trucklebed  Whiles his young maister lieth o'er his head  Second that he do on no default  Ever presume to sit above the salt  Third that he never change his trencher twise  Fourth that he use all common courtesies  Sit bare at meales and one halfe rise and wait  Last that he never his yong maister beat  But he must aske his mother to define  How manic jerkes she would his breech should line  All these observed he could contented bee  To give five markes and winter liverie  In Sat I Book III this couplet on the savage state of man is in the picturesque style of Lu∣cretius  Could no unhusked akorne leave the tree  But there was challenge made whose it might be  This couplet of Sat II is divine and a perfect specimen of the moral sublime  Thy monument make thou thy living deeds  No other tomb than that true virtue needs  In Sat III ridiculing a citizen's pompous feast he concludes  For whom he meanes to make an often guest  One dish shall serveand welcome make the rest  These lines in contempt of ostentatious charity are excellent  Who ever gives a paire of velvet shooes  To th' Holy Rood or liberally allowes  But a new rope to ring the curfew bell  But he desires that his great deed may dwell  Or graven in the chancelwindowglass  Or in the lasting tombe of plated brasse  This ludicrous description in Satire V must not be passed over  Late travelling along in London way  Mee met as seem'd by his disguis'd array  A lusty courtier whose curled head  With abron locks was fairely furnished  I him saluted in our lavish wise  He answeres my untimely courtesies  His bonnet vail'd ere ever he could thinke  Th' unruly winde blowes off his periwinke  He lights and runs and quickly hath him sped  To overtake his overruning head c  It is with regret I observe that Satire VI of this Third Book is foolish and absurd to the most contemptible degree and totally un∣worthy of the author it ought in justice to all the rest to be struck out of every future edition in which the fame of the author is at all consulted  Of Sat II Book IV these lines have no small merit  Let sweetmouth'd Mercia bid what crowns she please  For halfred cherries or green garden pease  Or the first artichoaks of all the yeare  To make so lavish cost for little cheare  When Lolio feasteth in his revelling fit  Some starved pullen scoures the rusted spit  For else how should his son maintained be  At inns of court or of the chancery  There to learn law and courtly carriage  To make amends for his mean parentage  Where he unknowne and ruffling as he can  Goes currant each where for a gentleman  In the same Satire speaking of a bankrupt he says  That hath been long in shady shelter pent  Imprisoned for feare of prisonment  The last of the thoughts in this quatrain has genuine wit  Whose mention were alike to thee as lieve  As a catchpoll's fist unto a bankrupt's sleeve  Or an  hos ego  from old Petrarch's spright  Unto a plagiary sonnetwright  These verses of the same Satire are excellent  How I foresee in many ages past  Where Lolio's caytive name is quite defac'd  Thine heir thine heir's heir and his heir again  From out the loynes of careful Lolian  Shall climb up to the chancel pewes on high  And rule and raigne in their rich tenancy  When perch'd aloft to perfect their estate  They rack their rents unto a treble rate  And hedge in all the neighbour common lands  And clodge their slavish tenants with commands  Whiles they poor souls with feeling sigh complaine  And wish old Lolio were alive againe  And praise his gentle soule and wish it well  And of his friendly facts full often tell  Afterwards speaking of the proud heir's pur∣chasing a pedigree and arms of the herald he wittily adivses him to take for the latter  The Scottish barnacle if I might choose  That of a worme doth waxe a winged goose  These characters in Sat III are very well  Ventrous Fortunio his farm hath sold  And gads to Guianeland to fish for gold  Meeting perhaps if Orenoque deny  Some straggling pinnace of Polonian rye  Then comes home floating with a silken sail  That Severne shaketh with his cannon peal  Wiser Raymundus in his closet pent  Laughs at such danger and aventurement  Whey half his lands are spent in golden smoke  And now his second hopeful glasse is broke  But yet if haply his third furnace hold  Devoteth all his pots and pans to gold  I know of no classic writer to whom the above lines would not do honour  This stroke in the same Satire is truly in the arch style of Horace  Florian the sire did women love alive  And so his sonne doth too all but his wife  Of Satire IV take this specimen  Hye wanton Gallio and wed betime  Why should'st thou leese the pleasures of thy prime  Seest thou the roseleaves fall ungathered  Then hye thee wanton Gallio to wed  Let ring and ferule meet upon thine hand  And Lucine's girdle with her swathingband  Hye thee and give the world yet one dwarfe more  Such as it got when thou thyselfe wast bore  Look not for warning of thy bloomed chin  Can ever happinesse too soon begin  The following strokes of Sat VII are admir∣able I must premise however that  Aquine  here means Juvenal who was of Aquinum not Thomas Aquinas as one might imagine from this very illimagined patronymic  When once I thinke if carping Aquine's spright  To see now Rome were licenc'd to the light  How his enraged ghost would stamp and stare  That Caesar's throne is turn'd to Peter's chayre  To see an oldshorn lozell perched high  Crossing beneath a golden canopy  The whiles a thousand hairlesse crownes crouch low  To kisse the precious case of his proud toe  And for the lordly fasces borne of old  To see two quiet crossed keys of gold  Or Cybele's shrine the famous Pantheon's frame  Turn'd to the honour of our lady's name  But that he most would gaze and wonder at  Is th' horned mitre and the bloody hat  The crooked staffe their coule's strange form an store  Save that he saw the same in hell before  Virgil's  varium et mutabile semper foemina  h  been much applauded the following sly insi∣nuation I think exceeds it  Was ever feather or fond woman's mind  More light than words the blasts of idle wind  Sat I B  These lines of the same Satire deserve selection  Would it not vex thee where thy sires did keep  To see the dunged folds of dogtayl'd sheep  And ruin'd house where holy things were said  Whose freestone walls the thatched roofe upbraid  Whose shrill saintsbell hangs on his levery  While the rest are damned to the plumbery  Yet pure devotion lets the steeple stand  And idle battlements on either hand  Lest that perhaps were all these relicks gone  Furius his sacrilege could not be knowne  The following lines of the next Satire are ex∣ceedingly well  Look to the tow'red chimnies which should be  The wind pipes of good hospitality  Through which it breatheth to the open aire  Betokening life and liberal welfare  Lo there th' unthankful swallow takes her rest  And fills the tunnel with her circled nest  In the same Satire  the black prince  is an un∣happy appellation of  Pluto  as that name is almost appropriated to one of the greatest of English heroes  The beginning of Sat III is fortunate  The satire should be like the porcupine  That shoots sharp quils out in each angry line  And wounds the blushing cheeke and fiery eye  Of him that hears and readeth guiltily  Ye antique satires how I blesse your dayes  That brook'd your bolder stiletheir own dispraise  And well near wish yet joy my wish is vaine  I had been then or they been now againe  In the first couplet above quoted however a simile is confounded with a metaphor  The following allusions are not unlucky  Yet certes Moecha is a Platonist  To all they say but whoso do not list  Because her husband a far traffick'd man  Is a profest Peripatecian  In Book VI and last which consists of only one Satire speaking of a factor who knows he is in his lord's last will and of his pretended grief at the sickness or his patron he proceeds  Then turns his back and smiles and looks askance  Seas'ning again his sorrow'd countenance  Whiles yet he wearies heaven with daily cries  And backward death with devout sacrifice  That they would now his tedious ghost bereav'n  And wishes well that wish'd no worse than heav'n  There is a curious mixture of the manner of Shakspere and Pope in the above quotation and in the following there is as curious an anticipation  Go Ariost and gape for what may fall  From trencher of a flattering cardinal  And if thou gettest but a pedant's fee  Thy bed thy board and coarser livery  O honour far beyond a brazen shrine  To sit with Tarleton on an alepost's signe  The following ridicule of the then fashionable style of writing shews that our author's taste was as just as his composition is excellent  He knows the grace of that new elegance  Which sweet Philisides fetch'd of late from France  That well beseem'd his highstil'd Arcady  Tho others marre it with much liberty  In epithetes to joine two wordes in one  Forsooth for adjectives can't stand alone  As a great poet could of Bacchus say  That he was Semelefemorigena  The following stroke upon false descriptions of beauty is witty  Another thinks her teeth might liken'd be  To two faire rankes of pales of ivory  To fence in sure the wildbeast of her tongue  From either going far or going wrong  I shall conclude with observing that no poet in our language has had so little justice done him as the writer of these Satires It must be owned that in reading satire we expect to find real characters which are here wanting every attempt of this kind being the evident product of the author's invention only and it must likewise be confessed that the whole work smells more of the scholar than of the man of the world To compensate these small faults this volume displays a correctness and manli∣ness of thought that for the age of conceits in which it was published are quite wonderful and in general a beauty and harmony of ver∣sification that leave little to wish Were my suffrage of any weight Bishop Hall should in∣stantly burst from the cloud which still enve∣lops him and like another Aeneas receive at once the honour due to his merit  LETTER XVI  YOU wonder at my assertion on a former occasion  Letter IX  that Virgil has not the most distant pretence to any attribute of a poet except that of a fine style To vindicate my opinion from the charge of rashness I now submit to you my reasons It is indeed dan∣gerous to attack the reputation of a good writer as I allow Virgil to be in any re∣spect for if your assault is not supported by a strong host of arguments it will recoil upon yourself But as I know your liberality of sentiment too well to fear your pronouncing hastily upon an opinion merely because it controverts your ideas or those of the world at large I shall lay what I call my proofs before you without hesitation  IT is agreed by all the critics that genius known by invention as a cause from its effect is the very first power and praise of a poet I believe however the most sanguine admirer of Virgil will allow that not one ray of inven∣tion appears thro his whole works His Ec∣logues considered as works of invention are beneath all contempt Where he has not followed the tract of Theocritus he has wandered into childish absurdity witness the Pollio in which because some senator's wife was brought to bed of a chopping boy he pro∣phesies the golden age will return I know some Christian writers have applied this pro∣phetic eclogue to an higher eventbut I see you smile in contemptand I pass the dreams of fanaticism Witness the Sixth Eclogue into which a system of philosophy has crept by some strange backdoor or other A critic in the Adventurer has pronounced all the Pasto∣rals of Virgil exceptionable except the First and Tenth now in these there is no inven∣tion both of them as that critic allows deriv∣ing their superiority from their being founded on real events I conclude therefore that Vir∣gil is in his Pastorals no poet but merely an excellent versifier  IF we proceed to the Georgics we shall find as few marks of genius in them as in the Pastorals in spite of the blind admiration which has been paid that poem The subject is confessedly unhappy for Virgil in this was the imitator of Hesiod as in his Pastorals of Theocritus and in his Aeneid of Homer  O imitatores servum pecus  was the just exclamation of his more ingenious cotemporary Horace How blind my friend must those be who could not infer if this remark be just how little is Virgil Virgil whose whose fame rests upon three specimens of imitation  To examine the Georgics by the criterion of invention which is that of genius and true poetry we must confess that in a didactic poem the precepts are quite out of the pro∣vince of invention and for this reason the didactic is the lowest of all the kinds of poetry But the Georgics are allowed to be Virgil's chief work the work on which his fame principally rests tho he afterwards aspired to be an epic writer what an epic writer and it follows that at the most Virgil is but an  excellent didactic writer even in the opinion of his most sanguine admirers that is if you please we will grant for a moment that he stands first in the very meanest rank of poetry surely no high praise  WHERE is his fame as a poet if it is proved that even this praise slender as it is is yet infinitely too high for him Yet this will be easily proved to those whose minds are not secured from the light of truth by the impene∣trable shades of prejudice  A DIDACTIVE poem must be written in such a style as to be understood by those to whom it is addressed If painting for example is the subject the language ought to be such as may be understood by any painter of common intelligence This rule universally just as it is must always be followed else the absurdity were as great as if a country curate should preach to his staring parishioners in Hebrew and expect they should follow precepts which it was impossible they should understand Com∣mon sense my friend which is so uncommon a thing among the critics and yet which enables  any man to judge better of writing than all the capricious dictates of criticism teaches us that the necessity of following this rule is in∣dispensable Yet it has not been followed by Virgil who writes to country farmers in a most elaborate and to them impenetrably ob∣scure style Who can help smiling to see him constantly addressing himself to people who as he well knew could not possibly understand him Yet he is called the judicious Virgil by those who can see very near as far as their noses with the help of a borrowed lanthorn  WHY dwell on particular absurdities of a production which in its very essence is ab∣surdity itself Yet we must not pass the Epi∣sodes and ornaments of the Georgics which have been hitherto allowed the very brightest proofs Virgil has given of genius or invention Let us weigh these proofs if possible in the very scales which critical Justice holds  THE invocation to Caesar's spirit the spirit of a tyrant who trampled on the liberties of his country could never have been written by a poet of real genius for invincible honesty of  mind has always been its attendant Fulsome flattery and adulation unworthy of the soul of a slave constitute the merits of Virgil in this admired address May execration pursue his memory who has placed a crown on the brows of a tyrant that were much too bright for the best of kings The signs preceding the death of Julius enumerated in the end of the book are in the same style with the address super∣stitious offerings on the altar of slavery They who find invention in either of these orna∣ments are welcome to feed on it mixed up with a little whipt cream  I ALLOW it were prejudice alone that could induce a reader to deny the beauty of the panegyric on a country life which closes the Second Book but at the same time it may be safely said that there are no marks in it of a superlative poet Of invention there are surely none nor of originality for the theme has been in all ages of poetry a trite one Virgil in this passage therefore as in others only dis∣plays great skill in the mechanical part of poetry but leaves the praise of a great poet to happier rivals  THE description of the plague in the end of the Third Book is evidently in imitation of Lucretius only more full and rich But  facile est inventis addere  and this Episode may give Virgil the fame of a happy imitator but never that of a true poet  THE story of Aristaeus in the last Book displays not the powers of Ovid tho superior in chastity of versification But who ever said Ovid was a poet  I TRUST it will appear from this deduction that Virgil has not in his Pastorals nor in his Georgics given any proofs of genius inven∣tion or that which properly constitutes a poet  THE Aeneid shall if you like the subject be examined some future opportunity and will I know add still less renown to Virgil as a crea∣tor  YET Virgil deserves all his fame a paradox you will say worthy of Rousseau  LETTER XVII  YOUR observation that there is a fatality which attends the reputation of authors as well as other human affairs is undoubtedly just How else shall we account for Milton's immortal poem lingering so slowly into fame while the most vapid productions of some of his cotemporaries acquired an instant celebrity as wide as it was illfounded  DUBOS has given us a curious theory of the manner in which works of merit attain their due reputation His reflections like those of other French critics are specious without va∣lue and massy without solidity Let us strike against them perhaps the truth will fly out  'NEW productions' says he  are at first ap∣preciated by judges of very different charac∣ters people of the trade and the public They would be very soon estimated at their  just value if the public was as capable of defending its opinion and making it weigh properly as it knows how to take the just side But it has the easiness to allow its judg∣ment to be embarrassed by persons who pro∣fess the art to which the new production be∣longs These persons are often apt to make a false report for reasons which we will ex∣plain They obscure the truth in such a manner that the public remains for some time in uncertainty or in error It does not know precisely what title the new work me∣rits The public remains undecided on the question if it is good or bad on the whole and it even sometimes believes people of the profession who deceive it but it only be∣lieves them for a very short time  THAT first period being elapsed the public appreciates a work at its just value and gives it the rank which it deserves or condemns it to utter oblivion It is never deceived be∣cause it judges disinterestedly and because it judges by sentiment  SUCH are the reflections of the Abbé du Bos whom I will readily allow to be the most judicious of the French critics if that is any praise Truth is against them Let us examine their justice by an illustrious instance  PARADISE LOST was sold by John Milton to his bookseller on the twentyseventh day of April during the witty and ingenious reign of Charles II when Dryden was at the head of poetry and criticism Did it instantly astonish the world as if a new sun had arisen No Three years passed changes of titles and other bookselling arts were employed ere a small impression could be sold tho not one of the trade of poetry perplexed the public opi∣nion Dryden who was at the head of that trade was the first to perceive and to applaud its beauties Criticism was the general pursuit of that age which was fully as enlightened on that head as the present What happened them would have happened now in the year Milton's divine poem would have met exactly the same reception as in And why The answer is evident the work was in a style of poetry above the popular conception  and the judgment of true judges tho it always prevails yet prevails with as much slowness as certainty  IN this lies the grand mistake of du Bos He supposes the public judges for itself it is always led by peculiar opinions and the recti∣tude of its sentiments depends entirely upon the superiority of its leaders being founded in truth or merely in fashion By  the public  I understand with him people of some know∣lege and some reading A man who reads for his amusement books in his own language and can talk a little on what he reads may afford a kind of abstract idea of what is meant by  the public  Now I will venture to compute from real observation that not out of who pretend to admire Milton are capable of understanding that writer Why then has he a place in their libraries Because he is men∣tioned with high applause by writers of reputa∣tion  HAD not Addison written his superficial cri∣ticism on Milton which is indeed adapted to the meanest capacity other men of learning  would have brought him into vogue for a superior poet is always the poet of the learned before he is that of the public at large  WITNESS the Comus L'Allegro Il Pense∣roso the exquisite productions of the same author which remained a feast for the learned alone for near a century after their publica∣tion They were published in and were taken no notice of The Comus L'Allegro Il Penseroso were taken no notice of at a pe∣riod when we sometimes find  the tenth edition  upon masses of metrical nonsense that are now unknown to have existed Let the public after this judge for itself A second edition of these divine poems did not appear till and even then they were not republished because they were called for but because they made a sizeable volume with his Paradise Regained then first published  WHAT is the reason of such poems falling into silence Is it not because those learned  en who happened to see and admire them  o opportunity of recommending them to  notice  AT the same time it must be observed that it is the impartial uninfluenced opinion of men of learning that commands the public judgement not that of such men of learning as are friends of the author for such decisions the public however highly it may rate the abilities of him who pronounces them yet has always discernment enough to set aside  SELDOM does it even happen that the opi∣nion of cotemporary men of learning influ∣ences the public which is the reason that the works of any living writer are very seldom justly appreciated Yet it may so happen that a writer from a happy circumstance may ac∣quire a reputation as just as it is instantaneous This was the case with the late Mr Gray who by his happening to be conversant in fashionable company gained a complete cen∣tury in point of reputation For tho fashion∣able writers are mot justly set in opposition to good the very epithet implying that their works will not last yet fashion is now and then in the right as well as other fools  IT is above observed that the opinion of cotemporary judges decides not that of the public The truth is there are works of superlative merit of which the most learned cotemporary can form no true estimate for works of uncommon excellence require to be viewed at a certain distance and in a certain light to have their due effect Set a picture of Raphael's against the blaze of the noonday sun and its beauties will be as little discerned as at midnight Let me add that an eminent writer is seldom the writer of his own times his mature mind precedes the advancement of his art and language very often by a full cen∣tury so that one hundred years and some∣times more must elapse ere the public has acquired intelligence enough to judge of him  LETTER XVIII  As I know your admiration of Shakspere and your fondness for any new remarks illustrative of the works of that wonderful poet I shall make no apology for laying before you such observations as have occurred to me in reading the last edition of his Plays I shall follow the order of volume and page as in that edition and must beg leave in com∣menting upon Shakspere likeways to comment upon his commentators  Vol I p TEMPEST Upon this line  Thy nerves are in their infancy again  is this note "So Milton in his Masque at Ludlow castle  Thy nerves are all bound up in alabaster"  WHAT in the name of wonder has this quo∣tation to do with the line in the text It might as well have been noted  "So Milton in his Sonnets  A book was writ of late call'd Tetrachordon"  MOST of the notes of this writer begin with  So  let it be pertinent or not which gave a wag occasion to observe that all his notes were  so so  P MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR I ap∣prove of the reading "Will you go on heris" Warburton with his usual rashness of half knowledge calls  heris  an old Scotish word for master It is the plural of  here  an old Scotish word for master or lord from the Latin  herus  Bishop Douglas often uses it in his translation of Virgil  Hyarbas king and other heris all  Book IV  The heres war wount togydder sit alsame  B VII  Bayth commoun pepyl and the heris bald  B IX  and elsewhere in the singular  The kyng hymself Latinus

P An two men ride of a horse one must ride behind  THE note on this passage informing us that Shakspere may have caught this idea from the common seal of the Knights Templars the device of which was  two riding upon one horse  is truly in the spirit of a man who has lost his  own ideas in the pursuit of those of antiquity for the sentence in the text which seems pro∣verbial must have arisen to the

care is intended to be shewn a cat being vulgarly said to have nine lives  P LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST Upon this couplet  When for fame's sake for praise an outward part  We bend to that the working of the heart  is this wonderful note which I need not tell you is by Warburton  The harmony of the measure the easiness of the expression and the good sense in the thought all concur to recommend these two lines to the reader's  notice  The lines will I doubt not strike you and every man of common sense not to say common taste as utterly destitute of every quality this apostolical alchymist recommends who in his dreams tries to convert the very dirt of Shakspere into gold The preservation of such nonsensical comments much arraigns the taste of his  variorum  editors  P "Some flighty  zany  " Zany

arts known to the ancients but lost to us Indeed  f you consider lyric poetry in its ancient ac∣  eptation only as WEDDED to use Milton's  trong expression to music perhaps the modern  ay in this view yield to the ancient tho even  his I believe might be controverted by those who have heard Dryden's Ode and Milton's  l Penseroso and L'Allegro accompanied by  he music of Handel But divesting lyric  oetry of its scenic representation and consi∣dering it solely as the amusement of the clo∣  et I deny that the modern is inferior to the  ncient and indeed the simple perusal or recital  now the only way in which any just parallel  an be instituted as the ancient music is utterly  st  NOR do I agree with you that the modern lyric poets of any rank are less numerous than the ancient and to support my difference of opinion submit to you some short account of the former This I do the more readily as I know your studies have not been much ex∣tended on this subject  OUR researches on this head shall be con∣fined to the modern lyric poetry of Italy of France and of England The Spanish writers in this line Lopez de Vega Gongora c I leave to those who have a soul lofty enough to understand bombast and grovelling enough to understand nonsense Those writers who do not know the art of gilding lead may learn it of the Spanish poets The works of Uz the German I cannot pretend to speak of as I hope I shall never study High Dutch but were they of any value I doubt not but some of them would have appeared before this in a more intelligible tongue  TO begin then with the Italians Petrarca shines in the very first rank of honour as of age One or two of his Odes or Canzoni have  already  Letter VIII  been said in a former letter to be ex∣cellent and one excellent ode is as much pre∣ferable to a number of middling ones those of Horace for instance as a piece of gold is to a number of pieces of silver His Sonnets I do not consider as lyric but as elegiac  NOT to speak of Bembo Casa or Molza the odes of Chiabrera have often grand pas∣sages tho he is more commonly a  Seicento  by which name the Italians understand a writer of the seventeenth century when a false taste was introduced by Marini in place of the pure slyle which had reigned till that time  SOME of the Anacreontic odes of Menzini are as fine pieces as have been produced in that very delicate and difficult mode of composition  GUIDI sometimes catches the true lyric spi∣rit but more often his fire is lost in smoke so that he frequently reverses the observation of Horace  non fumum ex fulgore  c  OF the works of Fulvio Testi I must profess much esteem tho they seem neglected by his countrymen He appears to have attained the genuine texture of lyric thought and style more than any other Italian poet I know without exception His images are frequently very rich and happy For example might he adduced the whole famous Ode to Montecuculli which cost the author his life particularly the begin∣ning  Ruscelletto orgoglioso  Che ignobil figlio di non chiara fonte  Il natal tenebroso  Avesti intra gl' orror d'ispido monte  E gia con lenti passi  Povero d'acque isti lambendo i sassi  Non strepitar cotanto  Non gir si torvo a stagellar la sponda  Che benche Maggio alquanto  Di liquefatto gel t'accresca l'onde  Sopraverrà ben rosto  Esiccator di tue gonfiezze Agosto  Placido in seno a Teti  Gran re de fiumi il Po discoglie it corso  Ma di velati abeti  Macchine eccelse ognor sostien su'l dorso  Ne per arsura estiva  In a più breve confin stringe sua viva  Tu le greggie e i pastori  Minacciando per via spumi e ribolli  E di non propri umori  Possessor momentaneo il corno estolli  Torpido obliquo e questo  Del tuo sol hai tutto alieno e il resto c  THE Ode to the Duke of Modena which begins the Second Part of his Poems intitled  Opere gloriose di sua Altezza in pace e in guerra  is likewise very rich and noble This image in particular may vie with Pindar for magnifi∣cence and Anacreon for beauty  Certo irrigata di celesti umori  Si vezzosa non suole  Rider in faccia al sole  La reina odorifera de fiori  Che piu pregiati assai  Bella Virtu non sparga odori e rai  THE Ode in the First Part  All Signor Conte Gio Battista Ronchi  exceeds any of Horace for elegant and pathetic morality witness this stanza  E noi s'el tempo irevocabil fugge  Sospirerem O Ronchi  E colmarem d'inutil doglia il cuore  Ah no Cogliam da questi campi il fiore  Pria che tempesta il tronchi  O maligno vapor l'arda e l'adugge  Folle chi piu si strugge  Il pensar al morir la morte affretta  E piu tardi si muor se men s'aspetta  THE Ode intitled  Si detesta l'avaritia delle donne  is transcendent Admire the sudden beauty of this transition in it and the genuine lyric manner of the story  O de la Gallia invitta  Non ultimo splendor Brenno guerriero  Io la tua gloria adoro e il nome inchino  Non gia perche sconfitta  Per to Roma restasse e'l seme altero  Quasi spento di Giano e di Quirino  Non perche l'Asia fosse  Trofeo de le tue posse  Ma perche d'empio cor gl' avari eccessi  Sapesti anco punir co' doni stessi  Era lunga stagione  Che d'assedio crudel cinte tenea  L'Efesie mura it capitan feroce  Poich' il ferreo montone  Con gl' urti bellicosi indarno avea  Dato al muro fedele assalto atroce  Mà dubbio era l'evento  Che pien d'alto ardimento  Osava it difensor fin sovra'l vallo  Salir più volte a provocar il Gallo  Quando d'aurei monili  L'armati schiere de Guerrier nemici  Vide avara Donzella irsen pompose  De le spoglie gentili  Ben tosto avida fatta i tetti amici  Patricida crudel tradir dispose  Patteggia il prezzo e guida  Per la ciec' ombra infida  Il cauto re dove per strade ascoste  Ne le mura infelici entrar puo l'oste  Già d'orror di singulti  Di gemite e di gridi Efeso è piena  Chi cede al vincitor chi Cade esangue  Le fiamme indegni insulti  Fanno a tetti dorati e per l'arena  Scorrendo và da mille rivi il sangue  Amorose

tesor resta sepolta  I shall conclude with the following fine speci∣men of another Ode  Al Signor D Virginio Cesarini  Rimanetevi in pace  Cittadine grandezze Io quì desio  Chiuder i giorni miei tra l'erbe e i fiori  D'esequie honor fugace  Non habbia il mio morir ne'l cener mio  Beva d'Affiria i lagrimanti odori  Ma semplici pastori  Spargan di latte ove tra canti e giochi  De la rustica Pale ardono fuochi  Da Numidica balza  Urna superba à fabbricar' intento  Per me dotto scalpel marmi non tolga  Godrò che dove innalza  Ispida quercia i duri rami al vento  Tumulo erboso il mio natale accolga  E se fia mai che volga  Ninfa pietosa à quella parte il piede  Del costante mio cor lodi la fede  YOU will excuse my dwelling so long on the merits of a writer whose worth and it is great is almost unknown in this country Certainly if the reverence of Italy secures the first place among her lyric poets to Petrarch the second is due to Testi but if just criticism were consulted in the affair I suspect she would divide the throne between them and place the rest at their footstool Every reader I believe must confess that there are in the above ex∣tracts the grandeur and opulence of Pindar the neatness beauty and elegance of Anacreon mingled with the pathos which the ancients ascribe to Simonides Perhaps in another cen∣tury the Italians will begin to see and admire his merit tho what cloud should obscure his splendor from them I cannot guess Yet some reason there must be for his not receiving due applause among his countrymen as I know none of their critics who have spoken of him as he deserves and very few indeed who have mentioned him at all I suppose he was a member of no academy  LEST my Letter should extend to an un∣reasonable length I shall defer my observations on the French and English lyric writers till my next  LETTER XX  IF the French have any title to a legitimate poetry it is that of the lesser lyric style Their language pretty and familiar can never rise to the sublime which indeed so far as I can see their poets of any class have never yet attained not excepting Corneille himself whose vaunted  Qu'il mourut  is to a British reader a very trivial thought We should deny the French with their epic poems tra∣gedies and comedies in rime any poetry at all were it not for such writers as La Fontaine in the lesser narrative and Malherbe Chaulieu De la Motte and the elder Rousseau in the lyric  RONSARD was once a fashionable lyric writer in France and nothing can be a stronger proof of the false taste of his age We have in our days seen a writer fashionable because he used a pedantic jargon of Roman English Ronsard  was likewise fashionable in his day because he wrote in Grecian French I hope by and bye the time will come when the most distant imitation of the sentiments and manner of classic writers for example Boileau's of Horace and Juvenal will become as it deserves as ridiculous and contemptible as Ronsard's adop∣tion of their verbage and idiom  MALHERBE has great merit as the refiner and restorer of the French language but I know of only one ode he has written which may yet be read with pleasure and that is the one addressed to the Duke of Bellegarde  CHAULIEU'S character and works you well know he is read more and De la Motte less than he ought to be The real beauties of De la Motte's odes are thicker sown than those of any other French writer  ROUSSEAU'S ode To Fortune has been much praised but in my opinion yields to that ad∣dressed to the Marquis de la Fare which has great merit witness these stanzas  Loin que la Raison nous eclaire  Et conduise nos actions  Nous avons trouvé l'art d'en faire  L'orateur de nos Passions  C'est un Sophiste qui nous joūë  Un vil complaisant qui se louë  A tous les fous de l'univers  Qui s'habillans du nom de Sages  La tiennent sans cesse a leurs gages  Pour autoriser leurs travers  Mais vous mortels qui dans le monde  Croïant tenir les premiers rangs  Plaignez l'ignorance profonde  De tant de peuples differens  Qui confondez avec la brute  Ce Huron cachè fous sa hute  An seul instinct presque reduit  Parlez Quel est le moins barbare  D'une Raison qui vous egare  Ou d'un Instinct qui le conduit  La Nature en tresors fertile  Lui fait abondamment trouver  Tout ce qui lui peut etre utile  Soigneuse de le conserver  Content du partage modeste  Qu'il tient de la bonté celeste  Il vit sans trouble et sans ennui  Et si le climat lui refuse  Quelques biens dont l'Europe abuse  Ce ne sont plus des biens pour lui  Couchè dans un antre rustique  Du Nord il brave la rigeur  Et notre luxe Asiatique  N'a point enervé sa vigeur  Il ne regrette point la perte  De ces arts dont la découverte  A l'homme a couté tant de soins  Et qui devenus necessaires  N'ont fait qu'augmenter nos miseres  En multipliant nos besoins  THE merit of Gresset in some of his lyric poems you well know I need not therefore dwell upon it and as I know no other of the French lyric writers who deserve mention I shall pass to the English after just observing that Boileau's noted ode so replete with tinsel and with nonsense proves that he had not the smallest spark of poetical genius and that he could not even have arisen above the meanest class of scriblers had he not been the very ape  of the ancients and had the address and agi∣lity of that animal sometimes to jump on the shoulders of his masters and the impudent ignorance to look big when dressed in their cloaths  THE list of English lyric poets contains the names of Waller Milton Cowley Dryden Collins Gray and Akenside not to mention the Earl of Surrey who is more venerable from his age than valuable from his composi∣tion Waller has no merit save that of Mal∣herbe in France that of polishing and refining the language of his country He has even less merit than Malherbe his pages being evident proofs of that old doubt  datur vacuum  I have read him over thrice to see upon what his fame stands but could not observe one image sen∣timent or expression that spoke the poet The fact is his fame is founded upon his estate which was of five thousand a year a wide foundation for renown His language which is by no means valuable now and of conse∣quence no foundation for present fame was the amber that preserved his weeds from rot∣ting but as that is no longer in price the  whole editions of his works may be thrown into the fire without any diminution Eng∣lish poetry Why should I dwell on the worth of Milton in his lyric works of Lycidas Il Penseroso L'Allegro or of Dryden in his ce∣lebrated Ode Cowley's Pindarics may accom∣pany Waller's works with all my heart one or two of his Anacreontics are good The merit of Collins lies in his tender melancholy his defects are confusion and incorrectness of style Gray is the first and greatest of modern lyric writers nay I will venture to say of all lyric writers his works tho few alas how few uniting the perfections of every lyric poet both of present and former times Tho Akenside considered as a lyric writer wants richness of images and melody his style will ever render what he has done in this way valuable  THUS I have now enumerated all the mo∣dern reputable authors of lyric poetry They are not few and I hope you are now con∣vinced that they yield not to the ancient in number nor in merit tho the lyric muse is now almost confined to the private cell of  study and seldom appears in her ancient glory attended by the richest music and graced with the audience of heroes  LETTER XXI  THAT five acts should be considered as an essential division of a perfect drama rather than any other number is perhaps one of the strangest instances its which reverence for a rule laid down by an ancient poet whose infallibility has never yet been proved has totally got the better of common sense and of the superiority of modern science  I REMEMBER that Vitruvius gives a reason perhaps as well grounded as any can be for this arbitrary division namely That the dra∣matic poets divided their fables into parts by a cubical ratio  Diviserunt spatia fabularum in partes cubica ratione  That is as Mr Dacier ex∣plains it that the four songs of the chorus be∣tween the acts joined with the prologue and  exode  formed the cubic number  six  the most perfect of numbers A reason that could only  have occurred to an architect yet perhaps as well grounded as any that can be given for a cus∣tom which admits of no reason It something resembles a rule which Menage in his notes on Tasso's Aminta tells us is laid down by the Signior Giovan Ogerio Gombaldo a personage as Menage takes care to inform us  intelligen∣tissimo delle cose della poesia dramnatica  most ex∣pert in dramatic business This rule is that the principal ladies in dramatic poems ought not to appear at the opening of the piece when the first scenes are supposed to pass in the morn∣ing  if the affair is not very important indeed  For why For reason good and weighty  Essendo proprio delle Donne it levarsi tardi l'impiegar molto tempo in abbellirsi a farsi aspet∣tare  It being usual for ladies to rise late to take a long time to dress and to give long expectation before they appear Hear ye dra∣matic poets of our impolite age learn wis∣dom and bow with reverence to the manes of Signior Giovan Ogerio Gombaldo  JESTING apart we all know that Horace's rule is not authorised by the Greek masters of the drama their plays being often divided into  three four six seven eight but seldom if ever into five acts in the intervals between these divisions the chorus sung and interludes were performed For Casaubon in his learned work  De Satyrica Poesi  will have it that between the acts the scene was often totally vacant of the tragic representation and that the ΣΑΤΥ∣ΡΙΚΑ or farces were played to relieve the audience from the melancholy feelings of tra∣gedy a practice we would recommend as a further improvement to those  semiliterati  among us who wish to revive the ancient cho∣rus accompanied with music but who would stare were they told by somebody who had read two books that they are as far from the ancient drama as ever THE WHOLE OF IT BEING ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED WITH MUSIC I think however the taste of the ancients might be vindicated from Casaubon's accusa∣tion as I differ from that learned man in his interpretation of the passage on which it is founded It is of Marius Victorinus the gram∣marian and stands as follows  Haec apud Grae∣cos metri species  iambica  frequens est sub hac con∣ditionis lege ut not heroas aut reges sed Satyros inducat ludendi jocandique causa quo spectatoris  animus inter tristes res tragicas Satyrorum jocis relaxetur  Casaubon observes that the same phrase  inter res tragicas  is likewise used on the same occasion by Diomedes another gram∣marian which I suppose only arises from the one's copying the other and that the phrase in both only implies  inter cogitationes rerum tragicarum  as a spectator may be said to be  inter res tragicas  "occupied with tragic affairs" as well immediately after the performance of a tragedy as during its representation  BUT to come to the point I have a great veneration for the ancients but a far greater for truth and common sense and it may I believe be safely asserted that had the ancients arrived at our perfection in the drama a sub∣ject perhaps of future discussion they would upon omission of the chorus have confined their drama to three as of modern duration as the most proper form and length Douglas one of the shortest of our tragedies has up∣wards of lines the Edipus Tyrannus of Sophocles one of the longest of antiquity has but with all its choruses which make no part of the proper dramatic action and  only correspond to our music between the acts Deduct lines belonging to the Chorus of Edipus and Douglas will exceed it by lines or the length of two acts If Douglas therefore had but three acts it were equal in length to the ancient tragedies  THIS with an admirer of the ancients may perhaps afford a strong argument for the reduction of our drama to a shorter duration But let us bring still stronger arguments from our own reason nay from that of the ancients themselves  PLATO has observed in his Parmenides that A WHOLE ACTION always consists of three parts  a beginning a middle and an end  Aris∣totle in his book on Poetry has with great justice applied this observation but without acknowleging its author to the drama con∣necting it with the conduct of the fable in these words  The  beginning  is that part which gives no room to suppose that any thing ought to have preceded it  he means in the representation  and which necessarily implies that something must follow The  end  is  quite the reverse for it implies that nothing should follow it but that something must have preceded it The  middle  implies that something must precede it and likewise something follow  This observation may be far more happily employed in the division of the drama The first act or  beginning  will then fix the spectator's attention by opening the plot and raising his expectation the se∣cond or  middle  will further continue his per∣plexity till he is utterly at a loss to conceive how the piece will terminate and the third or  end  will relieve him from that embarass∣ment and agreeable anxiety after it is carried to the utmost by an unexpected yet natural catastrophe  ARISTOTLE likewise praises the length ad∣judged to the ancient drama because the spec∣tator was able clearly to recollect and compare every circumstance from beginning to end The ancient drama as we have already seen is shorter by the duration of two acts than the modern and the observation of Aristotle will not apply to the modern drama for it is so long that it is not easy for the spectator to  recapitulate and observe the progress of so lengthened a story perplexed and ravelled as every good drama is  ANOTHER strong reason is that the authors of modern dramatic perfomances always labour so much under the duration they must extend their plot to that they are forced of necessity to have recourse to foreign and adventitious circumstances merely to eke out their pieces to a proper length Hence our love episodes and under plots and many of the other glar∣ing absurdities of the modern theatre our dra∣matic writers never having found out that the length alloted was more than any pure un∣mixed single action one of the most essential attributes of the drama would admit of either according to the practice of the ancients or common reason and observation  FROM these arguments I look upon the division of the fable into three acts into a beginning a middle and an end as the most perfect compact and elegant that the higher drama will admit Tho indeed I see not so great reason against four as against five acts  when the plot requires a longer period than usual to adjust and deduce Five and seven strike every mind as uncouth and heterogene∣ous numbers This remark you will say has no great depth nor philosophy but what have our amusements the subjects of our present examination to do with depth or philosophy Five modern acts may be looked upon as al∣most too long a duration for any fable fit for dramatic representation four have been ad∣mitted by one of our best living writers with much success The usual division of the drama here combated is one proof among many of the power of custom above that of truth and of nature  Ond' è dal corso suo quasi smarrita  Nostra natura vinta dal costume  LETTER XXII  THERE is a figure of speech which I know not if you have taken notice of and yet it occurs in one or two popular writers nay writers who have some just claim to praise if as a trope it must have a Greek name call it ANOIA in English UTTER AB∣SURDITY  CERVANTES has shewn no small skill in the use of this figure in Book III Chapters IX XI of the History of Don Quesada where we find Sancho had his provision safe after it was taken from him by the galley slaves and where al∣most in one page we read that he has lost his ass that he is riding on him and that he walks because he has no such humble conve∣nience when the truth is that the author had so far gone to sleep as to forget that no mira∣cles are now wrought upon asses and that if Gines de Passamonte had him Sancho could not In Book IV chap III we also find the hero of the work draw his sword after he was robbed of it  I MIGHT enumerate one or two more in∣stances from prose writers of repute but shall content myself with adding one instance from a Roman and one from a British poet as the figure does not stand much in need of illustra∣tion  VIRGIL in his Eneid book XII v makes Latinus speak thus to Turnus  recalent nostro Tiberina fluenta  Sanguine adhuc campique ingentes ossibus albent  In the name of all the profundity of dulness how could the streams be yet  hot  with their blood and their bones  whiten  the ground  JAMES THOMSON in his poem called Spring among his Seasons has with great tenderness of heart pleaded as from his very bowels against the inhuman practice of killing oxen to make beef stakes and almost told us he would rather want his stake than have any such doings Nay what is still more tender he advises us not to torment poor worms by put∣ting them upon the hook aliveUpon the hook For what purpose Why to catch fish sure which he proceeds to give us cool direc∣tions for as a fine diversion  Strait as above the surface of the flood  They wanton rise or urg'd by hunger leap  Then fix with  gentle twitch  the  barbed hook  Some lightly tossing to the grassy bank  And to the shelving shore  slow dragging  some  O JAMIE JAMIE Had you no bowels for fish The poor man forgot that fish had feel∣ings I suppose because he was fond of catch∣ing and eating them whereas killing of oxen was quite out of his way  LETTER XXIII  I PROPOSE in this Letter to continue and conclude my examination of the merits of Virgil as a poet which I began on a former occasion  Letter XVI  This scrutiny has already been ex∣tended to his Bucolics and Georgics and shall in the last place be applied to his Eneid which is confessed by his admirers to be much inferior to his Georgics a poem before shewn to have very little claim to applause Let us examine this Eneid with regard to its plan its characters and its language the grand divi∣sions of epic poetry  IF we take ever so cursory a view of the fable of the Eneid we shall perceive it to be servilely copied from Homer's two immortal poems the Iliad and the Odyssey The last of these gives the general design of the first six books of the Eneid the Iliad of the six last  The story of Dido which is considered as the only proof that Virgil gives of originality or genius in all the Eneid even by his admirers themselves is a most injudicious and absurd imitation of Homer's Circe It is injudicious because Dido from her courage and manly spi∣rit shewn in leading a colony from her native realm to a remote and barbarous land and settling and ruling that colony there must in the book of human nature page first be read to have been a character very little susceptible of tender passions far less of carrying them to such excess as Virgil represents It is injudi∣cious because Dido had formerly borne the loss of a husband without desperation n  y had shewn a spirit upon the occasion almost too heroic for a woman there is therefore no consistency in the character of Dido which is certainly one of the grossest faults any writer can be guilty of It is injudicious because there is likewise in this love story an inconsist∣ency in the character of Eneas which any schoolboy would be ashamed of the character of Eneas is that of perfect piety the PIOUS ENEAS gratifies the irregular passions of a fond woman and then in return for the kindness  she hath shewn to him and his followers he forsakes her without remorse because the gods command him so to do Impious Virgil would a Greek reader have cried Homer only wounded the bodies of the gods and their lesser morals but you have struck at their very vitals their essence You have made them guilty of cruelty of injustice of ingratitude itself Eneas if he was pious ought to have known that his gods could not be guilty of impiety and to have disdained any imputation to the contrary tho communicated in a vision This story is lastly utterly absurd and might have been added to our instances of that figure of speech because in defiance of chronology and of propriety Virgil brings characters toge∣ther as living at the same period the no less than years asunder What should we say of a writer who should now introduce into an epic poem Alexander the Great making love to Julia the daughter of Augustus Yet this were not so absurd by near a century as the amour of Eneas with Dido  WHY should I be condemned to follow Vir∣gil thro all his feeble imitations of Homer in  the plan and conduct of the Eneid Virgil's storm is Homer's tho Homer would not have begun with it The conversations of the gods are all Homer's Virgil meets Venus Ulysses Nausicaa The story of Dido hath already been spoken of Homer hath games Virgil hath games his very ships which he introduces as a novelty prove him incapable of originality for their accidents are from Homer's races Homer's ships are on fire Virgil's are on fire If Ulysses goes to hell Eneas goes to hell If Homer enumerates the forces of both parties so doth Virgil The tale of Cacus is indeed a puerility and the passage in which Eneas is represented as going  his own ambassador  an ab∣surdity that would not have entered even into the dreams of Homer Virgil indeed found the latter ludicrous invention of a prince and general leaving his army when surrounded by enemies in order to go an embassy which the faithful Achates was certainly the sit person to mediate I say he found this necessary to intro∣duce the affected and silly episode of Nisus and Euryalus which is  wondrous pitiful  Homer describes the shield of Achilles so doth Virgil that of Eneas Virgil then sends Iris to Turnus  to let him know that Eneas was absent from his army at a time when there was the strongest necessity for his presence and that it is a lucky hit  Turne quod optanti divum promittere nemo  Auderet volvenda dies en attulit ultro  Nay to increase the absurdity she tells Turnus that his wise competitor is gone not to pro∣cure a proper martial aid but to arm the coun∣try  collectos armat agrestes  Wonderful con∣trivance How we should have laughed at it in Blackmore Turnus takes the advice and at∣tacks the Trojan camp because Hector had attacked that of the Greeks The night scene and slaughter is a poor copy of that in the Iliad Ulysses and Diomed were the proper personages of such an action not two boys like Nisus and Euryalus  incredulus odi  The whole scene of the camp is such a copy of Homer's scene at the ships as a wooden print is of a painting of Corregio In the tenth book the gods come in again to fill up the story Who will hint the most distant comparison of the return of Eneas with that of Achilles tho evi∣dently a paltry copy Achilles leaves the fight from the most potent reasons Eneas leaves the  camp and the conflict merely that he may re∣turn The death of Pallas by the bye a most improper name for a man as it breeds an eter∣nal confusion with the goddess Pallas or Mi∣nerva is that of Patroclus  quantum mutatus ab illo  The funeral of Pallas is also that of Pa∣troclus The embassies for burying the dead c c are all from Homer not a death in the subsequent battle but from him The combat of Eneas and Turnus the leading fea∣ture of the twelfth and last book every one perceives at first sight to be a servile and pitiful imitation of that of Achilles and Hector  SO much for the plan and fable of the Eneid If we examine its characters we shall find it still more defective defective to a degree below contempt It hath been said by Virgil's ad∣mirers that Homer had exhausted strong and martial characters therefore Virgil was forced to have recourse to gentle ones gentle charac∣ters for an heroic poem The fact is that all Virgil's characters such as they are consist of copies or remote imitations of Homer and that Homer's subservient his lowest characters are Virgil's first and highest ones Wonderful  poet Judicious imitator To compare all the characters were tedious and needless but be assured that upon accurate enquiry every cha∣racter whatever of the Eneid may be found in the Iliad or Odyssey in as strong a degree as the plot and leading incidents above pointed out  TO conclude with the language of the Eneid there is not one sentiment or image in it but may be found in Homer or other Greek poets And I firmly believe from the observations of Macrobius on this head that there is not one phrase in it that is not stolen from preceding Latin poets that writer having told us in his Saturnalia and indeed proved in many in∣stances that Virgil's whole poetry is only a  cento  taken from more ancient authors  SUCH is the Eneid which the author with good reason on his deathbed condemned to the flames and had it suffered that fate real poetry would have lost nothing by it I have said that notwithstanding all Virgil deserves his fame for his fame is now confined to schools and academies and his style the pickle that has preserved his mummy from corruption is  r  and exquisite  LETTER

himself grievously mistaken He will soon perceive that a mind without learning however strong it may be in itself stands upon no basis and resembles a strong tower built upon a volcano and in perpetual danger of sinking into the abyss of ignorance As I sincerely wish him well and know his regard for my opinion I shall submit to you a few thoughts on the sub∣ject which you may communicate to him at a proper hour  LORD BACON one of the wisest men that any age or country hath produced speaking of political affairs observes  that no kind of men love business for itself but those that are learned for other persons love it for profit as an hireling that loves the work for the wages Or for honour as because it beareth them up in the eves of men and refresheth their reputations which other∣ways would wear Or because it putteth them in mind of their fortune and giveth them occasion to pleasure and displeasure Or because it exerciseth some faculty wherein they take pride and so entertaineth them in good humour and pleasing conceits towards themselves Or because it advanceth any other their ends So that as it is said of un∣true valours that some men's valours are in the eyes of them that look on so such mens industries are in the eyes of others or at least in regard of their own designments Only learned men love business as an action according to nature as agreeable to health of mind as exercise is to health of body t  king pleasure in the action itself and not in the purchase So that of all men they are  the most indefatigable if it be towards any business that can hold or detain their mind  This quotation tho long is so completely to the point that no sentence of it could be spared The argument contained in it is extremely for∣cible and ought to weigh with the most un∣thinking mind for he observes that none but men of learning love business of state for itself and certainly if a man takes no delight in makes not his supreme pleasure of his business let it be of whatever kind he will never ma∣nage it well much less rise to eminence in it  A STILL stronger argument if possible may be brought from the superiority which wide science gives a young statesman almost equal to that of experience itself Nay I even doubt whether in this particular instance learning doth not exceed experience as much as it falls below it in the practice of domestic life For no statesman let his age and practice be ever so great can from his proper experience have so much skill in the incidents of government as a man of solid and extended science to whom all climes and all ages are present A mind without erudition may be bold and acute  but cannot be vast and powerful By learning a man becomes an inhabitant of the world at large  This idea is commonly expressed by  citizen of the world  Is the world a city  and a cotemporary of all ages The excellent author above quoted observes else∣where that books are like ships which pass thro the vast seas of time and make the most distant ages to participate of the wisdom illumi∣nations and inventions the one of the other Shall we apply this beautiful figure to our present subject and infer how much superior must that merchant be who deals upon such boundless stores imported from all ages and from all countries to him who trades upon his own narrow homestock  PRESCIENCE which is so great a quality in a statesman is only acquirable by wide know∣lege of the events of former ages From that knowlege he may in very many cases foretell what will happen and of consequence use his prudence to guard against it Very few acci∣dents in political affairs are unique the seeds of most of them have been sown in the wide field of universal nature and they have pro∣duced similar fruit tho at remote periods  YOU will perceive that most of the above reflections apply to that kind of erudition which is to be found in history but above all in lives and memoirs These may indeed be said to contain the solid science of a statesman but if he wishes to be perfect elegant literature hath likewise great utility If a man hath ambi∣tion to aim at high rank in the scale of govern∣ment nothing is so likely to effect that end as eloquence and Cicero hath shewn and indeed good sense must convince us that no man can be a great orator without a large and un∣bounded fund of ideas Such a fund is only to be acquired by study and by appropriation of the ideas of others Hence the necessity of expanding the memory over the whole circle of knowlege  I SHALL only further observe before I con∣clude that the great examples to be found in ancient history operate like electrical fire when they meet with congenial minds The greatest modern statesmen have caught the flame of their inspiration from the altars which ancient Greece erected to honour and to virtue And for these altars built by solid science Greece  was indebted to Homer who stands first in the class of polite literature From Homer Greece derived that spirit which made her the wonder of other nations Immortal bard thou alone didst sound the charge at Thermopylae Thou alone didst conquer at Salamis and at Mara∣thon That a paltry corner of Europe should stand first in the rolls of fame is solely owing to thy divine genius  IF even the study of Latin literature could inflame Rienzi  In See the Life of Rienzi written by his cotemporary Tomao Fiortifiocca first printed at Bracciano mo or the Pere du Cerceau's History of his Compiracy Amst  a person of no rank or ex∣pectation so far as to operate his deliverance of Rome from the papal tyranny in the darkest period of her history tho his talents were unhappily not equal to his enthusiasm and he was unable to digest a great fortune as Pindar expresses it surely the study of the Grecian literature to which the other is but a shadow hath effected and will effect still greater things Plutarch in particular is a writer that should be the constant companion of a virtuous states∣man  The examples to be found in his lives of persons and of actions so replete with virtue and sublimity as almost to exceed human nature must elevate every noble and generous mind to a wonderful degree Sage of Cheronea Ho∣mer it is true kindled the flame but by thy cares only it is preserved bright for the perpe∣tual use of mankind  LETTER XXV  IN the garden of science as in other gardens it costs more trouble to root out weeds than to plant flowers I look upon the idea com∣monly entertained by men of letters in respect to Augustan ages to be one of these weeds and shall here shew you what may be done to root it out and destroy it  VELLEIUS PATERCULUS an affected histo∣rian was the first author of this foolish idea which other writers have taken on trust as usual without sacrificing to common sense on the occasion  WE are told by French critics and you know that Mr Addison at the same time that he ridiculed our attention to French fashions yet held up French critics who are far worse as worthy of all our reverence I say we are told by French critics that there have been  four Augustan ages as they call them The first is that of Greece in the time of Philip of Macedon in which flourished Socrates Plato Demosthenes Aristotle Apelles Phidias Praxi∣teles Thucydides Xenophon Eschylus Euri∣pides Sophocles Aristophanes Menander Phi∣lemon The second is that of Rome under Augustus near or under whose reign flourished Laberius Catullus Lucretius Cicero Livy Virgil Horace Propertius Tibullus Ovid Phaedrus Vitruvius The third is again that of Rome after the revival of learning and contains the names of Ariosto Sannazaro Guicciardini Vida Bembo Sadolet Macchia∣vel Michael Angelo Raffaello Tiziano The fourth and last is that of France under Louis XIV in which stand Corneille Moliere Ra∣cine c c  NOW you must observe my dear friend that we are gravely told that genius was during these ages carried to its greatest height in these respective countries A remark of superlative futility In the Augustan age of Greece for example where is the name of Homer who flourished about years before Where is  that of Plutarch one of the greatest writers that Greece produced and alone worth ten of these Augustan authors but who unhappily came more than years after In that of Rome where is Tacitus almost their only ori∣ginal writer In the age of Leo X where is Tasso the first of the Italian poets Where Petrarca Where Dante Where Metastasio Is not Gresset yet living one of the best writers France hath produced Where is Buffon Where poor Jean Jaques Where Voltaire  THE superior good sense and observation of the English hath taught them to six no Augus∣tan age for their country May her Augustan age be a  saeculum saeculorum  The names of Chaucer of Shakspere of Milton of Gray are as remote as those of Bacon and Newton centuries elapse between them Nature it would seem according to the  inventers  of these Augustan ages illuminates other countries by constellations of petty stars but in Britain concentrates the rays of many into one which dazzles her rival nations with  a luxury of light  IN political events my friend I lately had occasion to observe that nature acts much in one way they depend indeed upon the passions of mankind which are always the same and upon the rules of human prudence which ad∣mit of no great variation But in respect to genius which rules nature and is not ruled by her the case is very different True genius is as much above regulation in the period of his appearance as in all his other attributes And the principal writers of any country are as sel∣dom seen together as eagles They appear single upon the wild and losty rocks of genius basking in the noontide sun of fame  LETTER XXVI  AS I find my remarks on the last edition of Shakspere were not displeasing to you I shall now present you with such as have occurred on some of the other volumes  Vol IV TWELFTH NIGHT P  Would you have a love song or a song of good life  A song of good life means a pious ditty The clown's question is ironical  P 'It is silly sooth' Every boy knows this means  It is silly in sooth  It is of genuine simplicity  P  Mettle of India  the reading of the old copy is right The  mettle of India  the gold is Shakspere's To the  nettle  his com∣mentators are welcome  P The squabble between the two wise commentators about the meaning of Shakspere's obscenity is truly diverting In other editions an N is put among the other capitals and makes one of these jokes in which Shakspere appears but one of the people  P It is strange to see how the com∣mentators have here mistaken the clown's character who says to Malvolio  Are you not mad indeed or do you but counterfeit  They would fain make him talk sense Shak∣spere made him talk nonsense in character The question means Are you really in your senses or do you but act as tho you were As tho a mad man could counterfeit a wise man Absurd but highly in character Praises equally applicable to the annotators  WINTER'S TALE p Cadiss in Scotland I am informed still means  lint  Cadiss is put upon a wound is used to stop holes in barrels c c The servant is talk∣ing a jumble of nonsense and ignorantly mingles

Daemonum  a singular author who had the merit of being the first to discredit the belief in witchcraft and thereby to save the lives of many of his innocent deluded fellow creatures Yet such was the frenzy of his age that he actually passed for a magician who had written with a view to defend the fraternity from condign punish∣ment True it is that after his work in order to discredit the credulity of magic he wrote a small treatise containing the names of sixtyeight daemon potentates with directions for evoking them  O caecas hominum mentes  P 'From the nave to the chops' implies I doubt not that Macbeth ripped the rebel up from the navel to the neck At any rate if we must have nonsense that of Shak∣spere is preferable to that of his commentators at any time  P 'Take my milk for gall' That is take my milk instead of the gall whereon  ye live for my temperament is now replete with such diabolical bitterness that I might nurture daemons  P  Look like the innocent flower but be the serpent under it  is one of the most exquisite poetical figures in the world and is a fine instance how much a trite remark such as  The serpent lurks under the flower  may be improved  P 'Weïrd sisters' Upon the first ap∣pearance of this word  weïrd  should have been given the following learned explanation from Mr Ruddiman's Glossary to Gavin Douglas's Virgil  WEIRD SISTERS Parcae Skinner derives it from the German  werhen  to con∣secrate Some would rather bring it from  word  as the Latin  fatum  comes from  fari  and as the Latin  dictio  is frequently taken for  the response of an oracle or God  It comes certainly from the Anglo Saxon ƿyrd  fate fortune Francice  Urdi  fatum  c and these again are most probably from the Belgic and Teutonic  werden  Anglo Saxon ƿeorthan c to  come to pass  Because fate or destiny must  necessarily come to pass whence the Scotish  wae worth him  in Chaucer and Pierce Plow∣man  wo worth  that is  woe befall him  It may be added that in Chaucer the destinies are often called  werdes  P  'Go bid thy mistress when my  'drink is ready  'She strike upon the bell'  It was the custom in the feudal ages to drink wine at going to bed See an extract of a Pro∣venzal poem to this effect in St Palaye  notes fur la Iere partie  It was called in France  le vin de coucher  In the ancient list of the French kings houshold  le vin de coucher  is mentioned as a perquisite annexed to certain offices  P 'What in our house' We are as much obliged to the commentators for giving us such notes as those of Warburton on this place as we are to Shakspere for his scenes of fools and madmen interspersed with pathetic ones Well may Akenside make Shakspere say that Warburton's conceits are more strange  Than his own fools and madmen knew  Ode to Thomas Edwards Esq  Why preserve them ye his wise successors  P 'At first and last a hearty welcome' Can any one misunderstand this Sure nobody but the commentator Need I add that it means At the beginning and at the end of the feast an hearty welcome  P What is the meaning of the phrase  Tho bladed corn be lodged  Does it imply  tho corn just bladed be blown fiat on the ground  Surely if it does it forms a woeful anticlimax with the other image in this line and  trees blown down  Or does it mean a greater pro∣digy  does the lodged corn shew premature blades  by a transposition of the words not uncommon to Shakspere  BY the bye corn was with the ancient Ro∣mans esteemed a special object of witchcraft or enchantment witness this law of the Twelve Tables  Qui fruges excantasset poenas dato neve alienam segetem pellexeris excantando ne incantanto ne agrum defruganto  P The sublime apparition of the fu∣ture kings which has such a strong theatrical effect is I think founded on a passage of Ari∣osto See his scene in Merlin's cave  P 'Patch' is a common appellation for a fool with the old English writers allud∣ing to the  patched  or motled coat formerly worn by state fools So in The Praise of Folie translated from Erasmus by Sir Thomas Cha∣loner and printed by Bertholete to  b l  fig G  More happie and blisfull than is this kynde of men whom commonly ye call fooles doltes ideotes and  paches  And on the opposite page  I have subtraied these my  elie  paches  P  My way of life is fallen into the sere the yellow leaf  A most foolish emen∣dation of  May of life  for  way of life  is here rashly admitted into the text Shakspere's me∣taphor here challenged is My way my path of life which formerly was among the green the flourishing woods of summer is now fallen into the fading groves of autumn Can a juster metaphor be used The reading in the text is quite absurd How could May be suddenly changed into autumn Was Macbeth in the May in the spring of life Or to conclude all Is Shakspere always correct in his metaphors Yet observe and laugh when these annotators correct Shakspere they correct him into blun∣ders  P If the stage direction  Reenter sighting and Macbeth is stain  operates against the real speeches of the persons why reprint it from the folio The reader is doubtless much obliged to the sapient commentators for ran∣sacking musty folios to treat him with gar∣bage  Vol V KING JOHN p  Philip  is a common address from children to young spar∣rows kept tame when they feed them the note of the bird something resembling the sound of that name  P The vow is not in the forms of chivalry  P FIRST PART OF HENRY IV Gil∣don in his derivation of Hotspur's rant proves himself a critic twice the size of Warburton  P 'Halffaced fellowship' The image appears to me to be borrowed from coins in which only half the countenance appears Now countenance implies  protection personal friendship and assistance  as well as  the face  Witness the pun of a certain noble lord  who to procure a friend of his an election for member of parliament employed a citizen of the burgh canvassed for who had a very re∣markable face of deep scarlet studded with black lead He however exerted himself so well as to procure my lord's friend the elec∣tion My lord was upon the hustings at the time and after thanking the electors he turned round to his agent with these words  You will allow me to return my thanks to you Sir in particular for the  very remark∣able countenance  which you have shewn us thro the whole of this affair  Shakspere uses  halffaced  for  halfcountenanced  a fellowship to which the parties gave but half their genuine friendship and concurrence  P  Wasptongued  is a metaphor nothing like so hard as many used by Shakspere and implies with a tongue poisonous and keen as the sting of a wasp Let us with due grati∣tude return thanks to Mr Steevens for his skilful quotation to prove that Shakspere knew where the sting of a wasp lies not in its mouth but in its tail  P  To play with mammets and to tilt with lips  Mammet  is from the French  mamelle  a woman's breast The connection of the text calls for this interpretation  P Count Dillon in his Travels thro Spain gives us an explanation of the etymology of the name of that liquor called  sack  which is more plausible than that of the very ingenious annotator It is says he from  aque  a skin to put wine in Let me add that the Spanish word is derived from the Arabic and now signifies metaphorically a drunkard It is sometimes spelled  çaque  P Falstasse was not  here  or in the room which saves the prince from the charge of an absolute falsity The prince's speech con∣tains not one lye it hath only dissimulation and might have been spoken by a quaker  P  Favours  are a common expression for white cockades worn in the hat at mar∣riages and the like  gifts  from brides c c  P And behold it came to pass that Oliver Cromwell was discovered in these days to have studied his speeches in Shakspere  SECOND PART OF HENRY IV P The  rowel  every reader of a single book of heraldry knows was always a minute wheel radiated like a star  Up to the rowel head  im∣plies up to the head of one of the spikes with which the rowel was radiated  P  Rampalian  is from  ramper  a stout fellow or wench as  rascalion  from  rascal fus∣tilarian  is a fellow drest in  fustian  Mr Stee∣vens should reserve his erudite etymologies for the next edition of his friend's dictionary  P Shakspere's idea of a tempest hang∣ing the waves in the shrouds was certainly strong enough without his annotators pushing it to bombast Mr Steevens must have a bold heart and certainly deserves to be made an admiral for his notion that a tempest that  hangs waves  in the top  shrouds  of a vessel is a  moderate  tempest Pray do turn poet Mr Stee∣vens and give us an  immoderate  tempest by all means that we may know what it is to joke and be in earnest  P The ingenious annotator would not have asserted so positively that the surname of Hrolf king of Denmark namely  Krak  signifies a boy  had he read that rare book  Historia Hrolfi Krakii per Thormodum Torfaeum Hafniae    mo  where p Torfaeus learned as he was in the northern languages leaves us in uncertainty about its meaning and tells us that Saxo interprets it  a trunk of a tree  Magnus Olafius in his version of the Edda a dagger and Stephanius  a crow  P  I cannot away with  is a phrase of dislike used in the common prose translation of the psalms and other places of the bible oftener than once  P The reading of the old folio and quarto is right  he was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were  invincible  and that of the commentators wrong as usual Why may not a minute object be said with∣out any great figure to be  invincible to the sight My sight cannot overcome it  for  perceive it com∣mand it  might even be a vulgarism it is so easy a mode of expressionnay I believe it actually is  P  Port  is the common phrase in Scotland if I may trust my information for  gate  to this day being immediately from the  French The West  port  Bristo  port  c are the present names of the gates of Edinburgh  P  'I will not excuse you'  It is the first time I have heard that  variation of phrase  was a proof of  sterility of brain  but quite the reverse as every body knows If any writer could blot paper with such absolute absurdity why pre∣serve it The humour as Shakspere meant it lies in Shallow's being drunk and talkative and yet with all his prate being only able to express the same idea for want of others The fact is that not one of Warburton's notes was worthy of preservation for they do not even raise laughter or pity they are so utterly below the gripe of common senseand disgust and contempt are by no means agreeable emotions  THE note upon  William Cook  in this page is in the true antiquarian style and as such I leave it  Coke  I have no doubt was a proper name as well as  Canning  P Doll could not speak but in the language of the forest  Rascal  does not signify  rascal  but  lean deer  See what it is to be on the watch to show a little musty reading and  unknown  knowledge  THE word  Castillian  used somewhere in one of the parts of Henry IV or in The Merry Wives of Windsor I forget which appears to me to be derived from  castille  which St Palaye tells us is still familiar French for a  quarrel  Hence  castillian  quarreler  Vol VI KING HENRY V p  O for a muse of fire  Shakspere knew nothing of the allusions pointed out by his commentators What absurdity to imagine that Shakspere whose learning they utterly deny should be skilled in all the systems of philosophy What still greater absurdity to suppose that Shak∣spere had recourse to the depths of philosophy for a thought of the most trivial stamp  A muse of fire  is a  fiery ardent vein of poetry  a meta∣phor which had it occurred in some news∣paper poetry would have passed without notice by those who pretend to admire it and find out philosophy and God knows what in it  P The many times that Shakspere uses O for  a circle  have not occurred to me  P The remark that Shakspere derived his image of Expectation from Edward III in the horse armory in the Tower which by the bye I suppose did not exist in Shakspere's time is truly childish and worthy of a country booby on his first visit to the lions  P 'Confounded base' is a violent me∣taphor the same with  terrified base  base that is in fear lest the overhanging rock should fall on it Who ever heard that  confounded  signifies  worn  or  wasted  The sand by the shore  Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean  seems to me to be by Shakspere in this place called the  base  of a rock by the sea side as  that on which it stands  P HENRY VI d Part Anecdotes with regard to the mandrake may be found in Brown's  Vulgar Errors  P  Savage islanders  stabbed  Pompey the Great  It is very surprizing that the  learned  commentators should here challenge Shakspere for that ignorance which only dark∣ened their own minds Was not Pompey  stabbed in Egypt at that mouth of the Nile on which Alexandria stands Hath not the Nile seven mouths or outlets by which it issues into the ocean Were not the inhabitants of the interstices of land between these outlets with the utmost propriety called  islanders  by Shakspere while their respective territories are called  islands  by different writers of antiquity who likewise I believe give us their several names At any rate the whole space between the extreme mouths of the Nile is known to every schoolboy by the name of the  Island of Delta  But even independent of this interpre∣tation might not Shakspere in the exuberance of his fancy have here meant to express that the Egyptians who murdered Pompey must have been natives of Meroe or of the remote  islands  in the Nile toward the cataracts who are re∣presented by Heliodorus in his admirable ro∣mance if I mistake not to have been as bar∣barous as the Egyptians of the lower countries were humanizedShakspere I must say ap∣pears to me infinitely superior to any com∣mentator he has yet had even in classical sci∣ence  Vol VII p l for 'this it is' read 'thus it is' P l for 'posthorse' read 'posthaste' P A  bottle  spider is evidently a spider kept in a bottle long fasting and of consequence the more spiteful and ve∣nomous  MY remarks on the remaining volumes you shall have on a future occasion I shall conclude my present Letter with an apology for quoting a few blackletter books in these brief notes They are such as have occurred to me as worth reading from their curiosity or style for I do not think any one can form a proper knowlege of his native language without being a little versant in all its stages As to reading masses of antique nonsense on purpose to illustrate any writer gratitude is certainly due by the public to him who can sacrifice his very under∣standing in its service  LETTER XXVII  YOU remember well that the Abbé du Bos one of the most ingenious critics France has produced if that be any praise has in his Reflections on Poetry and Painting em∣ployed many chapters to prove that climate has a most certain and immediate influence upon the human mind His arguments I must beg leave briefly to recapitulate as I mean to set them in opposition to those of a more emi∣nent writer of our own and shall then offer you my own thoughts on this very curious subject since you require them  THE Abbé in support of his opinion first produces a beautiful quotation from Fontenelle 'Different ideas' says that amiable writer  are as plants and flowers which do not grow equally in all climates Perhaps our territory of France is as improper for the Egyptian modes of reasoning as for their palmtrees and without going so far perhaps the orangetrees  which do not flourish here so easily as in Italy denote that there is in Italy a certain turn of mind which we have not in France It is however certain that by the reciprocal connection and dependence that exists among all the parts of the material world the differ∣ence of climate perceivable in its effects upon plants ought also to extend its influence to the powers of the human brain  This argu∣ment fantastic as it may appear has more verisimilitude than may at first sight be attri∣buted to it Certain it is that the further natural philosophy proceeds the more connec∣tion is discovered between plants and animals and the most eminent botanists have confessed that the sur  plan of attaining to perfection in that science is to allot to plants as much of the properties of animals as possible such as sleep difference of sexes and the preference of one nourishment or soil to another  TO proceed with the most remarkable of the Abbé's arguments He attempts to shew that some countries have naturally given birth to arts without receiving them of others such as Egypt for instance and he might have added  China whereas in others some arts would ne∣ver take root tho planted by sovereign power and nurtured by golden showers of liberality He instances painting in England which had he received a prophetical glimpse of our days he would have omitted  MANY of his other arguments are those of a man who wishes to go ingeniously wrong and I must here beg leave to make one general re∣mark mark on his work naturally arising from his arguments and quotations on this subject which is that the Abbé throout displays woeful ignorance of the Greek tongue and Greek writers scarce one of which he even quotes tho they bear the same proportional value to the Latin as gold doth to silver Hence his admiration of Virgil and his seem∣ing to forget that there is such a writer as Homer in the world a defect utterly con∣temptible and unpardonable in a writer who pretends to instruct his readers in critical knowlege and a due estimate of works of literature To return  HE proceeds to shew the power of climate upon genius from the characters of nations and in the succeeding section offers his answer to such objections as may be drawn from the characters of the Romans and the Dutch so entirely opposite in ancient and modern times His arguments are derived from the changes which nature hath made on these countries In Rome by the infection of the ancient  cloacae  and in Latium from the want of cultivation and the marshes not being kept drained as in ancient times or from the mines he means  strata  of alum sulphur and arsenic which nature hath been forming by degrees and which exhale malignant vapours of power to affect both mind and body 'We see frequently' says he  in  La Compagna de Roma  a phaeno∣menen which forces us to think that the attraction of the air is owing to these mines  strata  formed near the surface of the ground During the heats exhalations arise which kindle of themselves and form long columns of flame If these  he adds  had appeared in Livy's days his history would have been full of the sacrifices offered for the expiation of such prodigies  The changes which na∣ture  hath effected in Holland lie in the destruc∣tion of her ancient forests now in many places discoverable fifteen feet below the surface of the earth and the consequent elevation of the ter∣ritory  IN the next section he shews by many inge∣nious instances that the difference of climates is in many countries owing to the difference of the emanations of their respective soils tho such countries are equally distant from the equinoctial line Poland for instance varies from England owing to the ground of the former being replete with salt that of the lat∣ter with lead tin coals and other minerals The Abbé concludes his remarks on this sub∣ject by arguments in another section to shew that the difference of talents in the same peo∣ple in different ages is to be ascribed to some variation of their climate So much for Du Bos  THE remarks of Montesquieu on the influ∣ence of climate on mankind I need not rehearse as they principally tend to shew the influence of climate upon manners an object quite dis∣tinct from our present which is the influence of climate upon the powers of the mind  TO make the scale even with the Abbé Du Bos I shall only recite a few verses of Mr Gray to be found in the fragment published of his admirable poem On the Alhance of Edu∣cation and Government necessary to produce  great  and useful men his own words and which by the way imply that he considered climate as deserving no notice even in the production of great men or men of genius  Can opener skies and suns of fiercer flame  O'erpower the fire that animates our frame  As lamps that shed at eve a chearful ray  Fade and expire beneath the eye of day  Need we the influence of the northern star  To string our nerves and steel our hearts to war  And where the face of nature laughs around  Must sickening virtue fly the tainted ground  Unmanly thought What seasons can control  What fancied zone can circumscribe the soul  Who conscious of the source from whence she springs  By reason's light on resolution's wings  Spite of her frail companion dauntless goes  O'er Libya's deserts and thro Zembla's snows  She bids each slumbering energy awake  Another touch another temper take  Suspends th' inferior laws that rule our clay  The stubborn elements confess her sway  Their little wants their low desires confine  And raise the mortal to a height divine  I believe however my dear friend you will agree with me that the truth as usual lies in the mid of these two extremes That climate hath absolute power over genius I will no more pronounce with Du Bos than with Mr Gray that it hath none In the utmost extremes of climate in Greenland for instance or in Zaara some kinds of genius I doubt not may be found in perfection so far as adapted to the climate such as the warlike or the legislative while others such as the speculative the phi∣losophical are totally heterogeneous to the soil When I speak of legislative genius as distinct from philosophical I mean genius capable of forming laws for a community of no implex administration a Lycurgus for instance they may have but not a Bacon As to other climes which are not in such extremes we are led to think that the defect of genius in some countries and the opulence of it in others is owing more to education and government pro∣ducing manners incompatible with the exer∣tions of genius or nutrition of such exertions than to a trifling variation of  the skyey influence  as Shakspere phrases it Certain it is that large countries in Asia of equal or superior tempera∣ture  of climate to any in Europe have in no time produced men of equal genius Europe hath indeed for these three thousand years been the quarter of the world to which true and legitimate genius seems confined Even in poetry which is the least subject to climate of any exertion of genius the Asiatics have in all ages been woefully inferior to the Europeans In all ages the poetry of the Asiatics has been strained to bombast and glittering with all the beauties of absurdity from the most ancient epoch down to our own times As several cri∣tics have of late shewn a very different senti∣ment with regard to holy writ in particular which they in their fondness of enthusiasm would fain find as eminent in composition as in sanctity I must beg leave to enforce my last assertion a little and shall easily shew that when they attempt to debauch our taste by commenting on the beautiful and grand passages of scripture they are forced to relin∣quish every rule of sound sense To instance in a few of the most noted passages  'LET there be light and there was light' hath been sung upon  usque ad fastidium  owing  to a forged addition to Longinus not to be found in any authentic MS as Le Clerc hath shewn who likewise informs us that this pas∣sage is a common barbarism A common bar∣barism I grant may yet be sublime but did this passage ever strike any reader as sublime till he read its illuminators Certainly not Fine sublime that requires a label like  This is a bear  of the bad painter to point it out Sub∣lime that does not strike at once and strike all assumes that title falsely  Clothed his neck with thunder  I will venture to pronounce the most consummate nonsense that ever was clothed with the thunder of bombast Had it been found in some Grubstreet writer of heroic panegyric we should never have done laugh∣ing at it A horse wearing a neckcloth in battle a neckcloth of thunder  Proh Deum at∣qus hominum fidem  Dr Blair in his Lectures who threatens in his preface to think for him∣self and who I grant you hath employed much thought about what he could pillage from his predecessors for his own use very gravely tells us Lect XLI that  Isaiah describes with  great majesty  the earth  reeling to and fro like a drunkard and removed like a cottage  I see  you laugh yet one or two instances more The same writer who thinks for himself tells us that the comparison Sam XXIII  He that ruleth over men must be just ruling in the fear of God and he shall be as the light of the morning when the sun riseth even a morning without clouds as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain  is one of the most regular and formal in the sacred books If so I wish him joy with all my heart For my part I likewise think for myself and I see  two similes  in this passage both totally  unlike  informal and irregu∣lar But I am afraid of being tedious on a subject so clear and shall return in observing that for absurd and filthy imagery witness some parts of Ezekiel the best of the sacred writers the scripture yields to no composition in any language but of sublime or beautiful style I can from that work produce no proofs Writers who hold it up in that ludicrous view do as great harm to religion as to good taste it resembles the dressing of a pious and worthy clergyman in the garments of a hero or of a lovely woman and then telling us he hath the sublimity the one and the beauty of the  other whereas it only puts him in an aukward light and brings derision and contempt upon his holy character  THE eastern writings are to this day re∣markably deficient in that quality which we call good sense and which must reign in an eminent degree over works even of the warm∣est fancy if they are meant to please the true judge The nightingale's love for the rose and all the other trite and absurd imagery of their best poetry appear mere childishness to the superiority of European wisdom The vales of Asia it is true teem with flowers but they are sickly and of no duration among the odorous forests that spread fragrance over the eastern countries the strong oak of sense will not flourish  CLIMATE I conclude upon the whole hath some power over genius but not so much as is ascribed to it by some writers nor so little as is imputed by others To attempt to mark the boundaries of its dominion would be one of those airy speculations that serve to display the writer's ingenuity at the expence of his wis∣dom  LETTER XXVIII  AMONG the innumerable foolish books of memoirs which the French little heroes of their own tales have produced I be∣lieve no mean rank in absurdity is due to those of Cardinal De Retz Lord Chesterfield that profound genius hath recommended them to public notice in Letters which it must be con∣fessed were not meant for the public eye but which stand in the inverse ratio of the work  De rebus expetendis et fugiendis  good judges always taking his recommendation as sufficient dispraise De Retz and Bouhours are his fa∣vourites the first an ecclesiastic who de∣bauched women and the other an ecclesiastic who debauches taste Bouhours was in fact fifty years ago known to be a true French critic who prates much by rote like a parrot of what he could not understand The fatuity of De Retz is it must be owned hid with a better masque That masque is a false appear∣ance of depth I say a false appearance for to to an eye of any penetration the sapience of De Retz is fragile and transparent as glass  HIS memoirs are addressed to a lady poli∣tical memoirs to a lady Then he tells how many duels he fought and how  immensely gal∣lant  he was O the pretty statesman No lady could see him without loving him because he had fine teeth as he tells us was observed of him at court He differs with Mazarine about nothing and is feared before it was known that such a person existed  TO be serious The talents of De Retz are thought amazing because he had the mob of Paris at command and his political knowledge thought superlative because he tells us with all the pomp of maxim that no mob can bear  se desheurer  to lose a meal for this last is the only political axiom of his that I have seen taken notice of To have a mob at command is no proof of talents as a late occasion must convince us that occasion must likewise shew the futility of the axiom above recited  IF ever there was a superficial egotist who had knavery just enough to save him from being a fool who tells such lyes from mere vanity as carry confutation in themselves not  to speak of the reprobative testimony of co∣temporaries who is always the hero of a tale of a cock and a bull it is De Retz If ever there was a writer who acquired a false reputa∣tion of depth from mere muddiness of affecta∣tion whose foolish gravity passes for wisdom who is in every point a mere French scribler of memoirs it is De Retz  IN the Menagiana we are informed that De Retz used to tell a story of his having seen a man catch hold of the vane of a windmill go round on it and alight on the spot of ground from which he had set out This wise tale which I suppose is another instance of his political talents always struck me as a most just emblem of the Cardinal himself He caught hold of a vane of the populary windmill took a round and was just where he was saving that the height and rotation had such an effect upon his brain as he never got the better of but ever after spoke and wrote like a visionary oracle  LETTER XXIX  FARCE is no such modern invention as you imagine On the contrary it is I have no doubt the most ancient of theatrical exhibitions Nor is pantomime much more modern As I know you pique yourself more upon using your own sense than that of others upon elegant knowlege than upon erudition I hope some little disquisition upon this point will prove an agreeable amusement to you  CASAUBON in his very learned treatise on the Satyrical Poetry of the Greeks and that of the Romans has well established a very remote distinction between the  satires  of the two na∣tions Those of the first were little pieces or farces represented on the stage Those of the latter were a species of poetry quite distant from such representation being merely moral poems mingled with invective against vice and vicious characters One instance only of the former is preserved in the Cyclops of Euripi∣des examples of the last may be seen in the writings of Horace of Juvenal of Persius  TO proceed with the former which is the object of our present enquiry the ΣΑΤΥΡΙΚΑ or Farces of the Greeks were the invention of their festival days instituted in honour of the gods for that wise and gay people rightly imagined that the joy of man is the supreme praise of the Deity Tzetzes tells us these en∣tertainments were the invention of rude rustics by which Casaubon understands that their origin is to be ascribed to the most ancient age before towns were built or civil society established That the ΣΑΤΥΡΙΚΑ is the most ancient species of dramatic writing we have the au∣thority of Aristotle himself who tells us that the choruses of ancient tragedy are borrowed from them  A circumstance not attended to by any of our critical writers who universally look on the choruses as the original parts of tragedy being at first songs in honour of the deities to which dialogue was added by de∣grees How long will our English critics dully follow the French and tread always in the paths of each other for fear of being lost in a search after the original fountains of know∣lege These satires of the Greeks were so  called from their actors who personified the Satyrs the imaginary attendants of Bacchus at whose festivals they were originally per∣formed whereas the Latin Satyrae are derived from  satur full  as replete with variety of matter For we must observe that the ancient Roman Satyrae were not continued invectives against vice but sometimes treated the advan∣tages of virtue and the like in an ethic and severe tone Such is Casaubon's etymology but why may not the Roman  satyrae  or  saturae  as more anciently written be derived from  Saturn  the deity at whose festivals the fas∣cenine verses the rude sketches of the Roman satire were chiefly recited  TO return to the Greek farces Their origin and etymology have been shewn now for their subject In this they differed totally from our farces that they admitted of tragic sub∣jects nay the most ancient of them knew no other Yet these subjects were not completely tragic but allowed of a mixture of comic scenes even in those that bore the hue of tra∣gedy They were in fact short tragicomedies Mr Addison with his usual French superfici∣ality  of science tells us that tragicomedy is the monstrous product of the English stage It was known to his admired ancients both Greeks and Romans as he might have known had he read Athenaeus with regard to the former or the prologue to the Amphitryon of Plautus for we shall not expect that he would read the piece itself with regard to the latter By both nations it was applauded and admired And Shakspere alone might convince us that it is the most natural and consequently the most proper way of constructing a drama tho not the most safe or artificial as requiring far greater powers in the writer than when one turn of sentiment is begun and continued from the beginning to the end of a piece  UNHAPPILY the only specimen we have of the Greek farce is in the tragic style but from it we may judge of the others for even in this the shocking story of Odysses or Ulysses and the Cyclops is apparently treated in such a ludicrous way as to produce the complete effect of Tom Thumb Chrononhotonthologos or the like mock tragedies If such were the tragic farces the comic ones must have super∣abounded  with broad humour and laughter The humour I however judge from the per∣sons a mob of drunken satyrs must have been very impure and suspect that the decency of the Cyclops of Euripides is the great reason of its being preserved in preference to so many others  CASAUBON hath on this subject crouded his treasures drawn from the very depths of Greek and Roman erudition with great profusion The learning he displays on this very curious subject amazes even the learned I shall not however attempt to string any more of his pearls but content myself with observing that in his long enumeration of eminent Greek writers of farce are the names of Thespis Aeschylus Sophocles Euripides Plato Lyco∣phron Bion  AT what time the moderns thought of annexing farces to larger dramatic pieces in order to diversify the entertainment I will not take upon me to determine but suppose the practice was not established in England till the Restoration Among other customs borrowed  from France I take this to have been one The word  farce  is originally Latin I suppose from  farcire to fill to stuff  alluding to its filling the entertainment and rendering it complete Like other Latin words it has passed to us thro the channel of France but is not in my opinion from the French  farcer to play the droll  I rather think that verb is from the sub∣stantive as we may say  to make a farce of a thing  THE ancient farces as hath been already observed on another occasion were very com∣monly performed between the acts of their tragedies or comedies as ballets are now danced between the acts of operas By the bye one cannot help laughing at Mr Addison's better attack upon the opera and his professed admiration of the ancient dramas The opera is a complete copy of the ancient drama in all its parts of recitation and song accompanied with music and dance a formal chorus it is true is not now introduced but the actors themselves form the singing chorus in a way much more natural and proper and for the  another province of the ancient chorus  unknown to its modern wellwishers a real and distinct chorus of ballet dancers is preserved in all its lustre  THE modern farces are with more propriety brought forward at the close of more important dramas and are particularly necessary after tragedy to relieve the mind and prevent our sorrows arising from fiction to enter into real life where too many real sorrows await us  IT is almost unnecessary to add that in many of our farces are to be found some of the strongest comic situations and the most genuine wit and humour that grace our stage In our farce we allow more latitude of plot broader humour and higher colour of charac∣ter than in comic dramas of a greater denomi∣nation Comedy tho she ought always to be chearful is generally content merely to simper and smile whereas Farce ought always to laugh aloud To the eminent names of Greek writers of farce mentioned above the English may add those of Fielding Garrick Smollet Colman  HAVING spoken so much of farce let us now consider pantomime The prodigious estimation in which this art and its professors were held by the ancients appears from innu∣merable testimonies of their authors To quote two or three of them were ridiculous for one cannot open an ancient who takes any notice of or derives any metaphor from the theatre without observing the important light in which they considered pantomime Nor shall we wonder at this when we remark the high perfection to which the ancients had carried this art By the gestures merely of the panto∣mimic actors were the ancient audiences infi∣nitely more affected either with tragic or comic sensations than with all the dramatic pomp of musical declamation and sympathetic force of recitative If you wish more information on this head peruse Lucian's treatise "On Panto∣mime"  THE further south we go the more do people use gesture and the more are they affected by it A Frenchman uses infinitely more gesticulation than an Englishman and an Italian still more than a Frenchman Hence  Italy has always been the proper climate of pantomime In ancient and in modern days the  sannio  or  harlequin  with all his brethren of grimace have chosen Italy for their chief theatre of action Italy has both in ancient and modern times been the inventress of ludi∣crous pantomime and I suspect also of serious which now only exists in the grand ballets of the opera lately brought almost to ancient perfection and pathos by Noverre Magnifi∣cence in particular the grand character of the ancient stage is in these ballets or modern serious pantomimes carried to a greater height than in any other theatrical exhibition of these times  BUT it is the pantomime of the English stage that now draws our attention The con∣tempt expressed for this expensive amusement by some men of severest wisdom is itself con∣temptible No amusement deserves scorn that is an innocent relaxation from anxious thoughts and the cares of life No dramatic exhibition excites less thought or more ocular attention than pantomime none is of consequence more calculated for the man of study or of care  IT may however be regretted that the sums expended in Grecian days to place their grand tragic scenes in an exuberance of decoration are now wasted on this inferior performance The magnificence of unmeaning processions c in present pantomimes is amazing The managers of the winter theatres commonly produce a pantomime in the course of every season and rival each other in this annual extravagance with the profusion of two rich peers contending for the return of members of parliament These pantomimes are commonly brought forward during the Christmas holi∣days when all the world is idle and the con∣stant succession of them shews that the mana∣gers do not form their nesteggs of gold to use a metaphor Hudibrastic without making their clients lay in proportion  INDEED pantomime is now the best enter∣tainment we find in our theatres It is quite astonishing to remark how much our stage hath declined within this half dozen years since the retreat of Garrick It is overwhelmed with floods of Irish nonsense and stuff more stupid than stupidity where not one glimmer of sense  or wit appears Had those Irishmen female scriblers c offered their trash to a Bartholo∣mewfair audience a few years ago they would have been hissed to scorn Our poor audiences sit with Dutch phlegm and take what God sends English good nature or  bon hommie  if you please puts us upon a level with the most stupid and barbarous of nations What the judgement of our audiences condemns their  good nature  with a vengeance comes in and reprieves at the very gallows However it is some consolation to know that our stage cannot possibly be worse than it is so it must mend of course  CHANGE of scene was totally unknown to the ancients in this mute display they must therefore have yielded to the wonderful me∣chanism of modern times The mechanic wit of modern pantomime is transcendant a law∣yer is changed into a lady of Billingsgate and a judge into an owl in a moment With regard to the dignity of amusement I suppose our comic pantomime yields not to that of the ancients for Plutarch tells us in his Sympo∣siacs that dogs regularly bred to the stage per∣formed  parts in the ancient pantomime a per∣fection to which we have not yet arrived  THE modern harlequin is a perfect copy of the ancient  sannio  or  mimus  The  mimus  had his face smeared with soot  fuligine faciem obductus  and wore a habit patched of many colours as we learn from Apuleius in his Apology  Quid enim si choragium thimelicum possiderem Num ex eo argumentavere etiam uti me consuevisse Tragaedi syrmate Histrionis crocota  Mimi centunculo The  centunculus  is a dimi∣nutive of  cento  used by Juvenal for a garment made of patches whence it is applied metapho∣rically to a poem composed of shreds of others as the noted  cento  of Ausonius  THE other pantomimic persons of our theatre are Columbine Pantaloon and the Clown The Italians have likewise The Doc∣tor Beltrame of Milan Scapin The Italian Captain The Spanish Captain Scaramouche Giangurgulo the Calabrian Mezzetin Tartag∣lia Punch Narcisin de Malabergo A grand pantomime including all the Italian personages in their proper characters is yet wanting to the English stage  LETTER XXX  I DO not wonder that the praises which Dr Blackwall hath bestowed on Gravina's work DELLA RAGION POETICA together with the uncommon title of the work itself have excited your curiosity The book is rather rare tho of no great price and till I can procure you a copy accept a short account of it  IT is divided into two books and addressed  A Madama Colbert Principessa di Carpegna  an impropriety similar to that of De Retz in addressing a work to a person who could never be supposed to understand it Was the patro∣ness the daughter or niece of the great Colbert He mentions her ancestors as being of Scot∣land and passing into France By the bye the Scotish name is Cuthbert and Mr Cuthbert of Castlehill an old Scotish title assumes as I am informed by different countrymen of his the name of L'Abbé Colbert when at Paris where he hath fixed his residence  IN this address there is nothing remarkable save a very just remark which tho made like∣wise by Pope is not and never will be suffi∣ciently attended to namely  that there is equal difficulty in judging perfectly well of poetry as in composing with perfection and that it is far easier to be a middling author than a just critic  He proceeds in the address to shew the design upon which his work is written and what he understands by the title of it DELLA RAGION POETICA  Of the Reasons or first Causes of Poetry  and ob∣serves that as every noble edifice is built ac∣cording to the rules of architecture and these rules have geometry for their  ragion  or first cause so the knowlege of poetry is the  ragion  or foundation of the rules of poetry He then proceeds to shew the true knowlege of poetry to consist in an eternal idea of fitness of things and in the fifteen or sixteen succeeding sections utterly loses himself in the Platonic system on which a man of great mind who gives himself up to erudition is so apt to be wrecked Platonism was indeed the madness of Gravina as appears from all his works and an attach∣ment to an enthusiastic system is the grand rea∣son  why the works of the master of Metastasio have been so little read  FROM this account of the leading idea of his work you will at first glance perceive that the fabric rests upon sand Nothing indeed can well be more futile nor of falser criticism than to infer an analogy between geometry the coldest operation of the judgement and poetry the warmest exertion of the imagina∣tion The fact is that the rules of poetry have no  ragion  as he quaintly and abstractedly calls it but the example of former poets I beg par∣don for the expression  rules of poetry  Poetry knows no rules The code of laws which Genius prescribes to his subjects will ever rest in their own bosoms  Rules of criticism  was the expression I meaned to use and these have no  ragion  or first foundation at all They are drawn from Homer Sophocles and Pindar what these masters do say the critics is right and every thing else is wrong Poor judges Ye slaves who judge of your masters Is not NATURE greater than Homer Sophocles or Pindar Is not GENIUS the supreme arbiter and lord of Nature's whole domain her superior  her king her god Bring out your candle then and teach the sun how to exert his meri∣dian power  IN these first fifteen sections there are nevertheless some remarks worth notice such as this  we must study diligently to impress upon verse an appearance of negligence that the imagination may not revolt from its delu∣sion thro the force of apparent artifice  That upon the native gravity of the Romans is curi∣ous and he ascribes to this the defect of Latin comedy He observes in another place that Terence hath no comic force and that Volcatius Sedigitus an ancient critic placed Terence only in the sixth rank even of Roman comic writers yet his works and those of Virgil have reached us Such is the power of style  MANY of his observations upon Homer are fine such as his being the greatest poet be∣cause his works all bear the very stamp of na∣ture none of his characters being perfect the virtuous being painted as capable of vice and the vicious as guilty of virtue Perfect cha∣racters  form indeed a sure mark of a middling writer who cannot copy nature but only a feeble idea of perfection in his own breast They are always insipid witness Eneas the most insipid character ever drawn for the vices of Eneas his dereliction of Dido c are not described as imperfections of character but are indeed mere inconsistencies  HIS idea of the theology and philosophic system of Homer I look upon as without foun∣dation Homer I am certain had no allegory whatever in view when he wrote either of his immortal poems his only intention was to entertain and perhaps to make money by furnishing amusement to others Let us not look upon the last motive as sordid it was the motive of Shakspere I know of no book whatever that may not be turned into an alle∣gory with the help of a smattering analogy which the meanest fancy is capable of forming Alchymy has been found in the Hypneroma∣chia of Poliphilo in all its secrets and I doubt not might likewise be discovered by an adept in the Iliad or in the Odyssey They who find any thing in these poems more than the  entertaining narration of an interesting story are methodists in poetry and have as great a title to the inward light which always comes thro a crack in the skull as the methodists in religion  AFTER escaping these fifteen sections of Platonic frenzy we happily arrive at his cha∣racters of the most eminent poets of ancient Greece and Rome who have all according to the author's enthusiastic theory written up to his idea of making all poetry a mystic veil of Platonism He however doth not always harp upon the string of his madness and when he doth not his characters of the several ancient poets are admirably just and fine  HE concludes the first book with characters of the modern Latin poets of Italy after sew∣ing them to his system by a coarse thread of discourse for he tells us that there is now no occasion for mysticism in poetry it being the fashion for truth to appear without any cover∣ing As I hold modern Latin poetry in utter contempt I need not tell you that I agree with him in no one character of any of its au∣thors  IN the second book he returns to his Pla∣tonism with fresh vigour in charactersing Dante on whom he dwells thro many sec∣tions He afterwards proceeds to value the other Italian poets mostly with great justice and acuteness  THIS is I believe an accurate analysis of Gravina's celebrated performance  Della Ragion Poetica  a work which tho written by a man of fine taste and ample talents is yet only a monument of the pernicious effects of system upon any science Lord Bacon hath observed that any faculty reduced to an art must of ne∣cessity become barren because art circumscribes it as for instance no good poetry can be writ∣ten by an author who pays the smallest atten∣tion to arts of poetry Which  arts  of poetry are indeed in my opinion so many contradic∣tions in terms for poetry is a faculty not an art an exertion of the mind to be circum∣scribed by rules only when some wonderful inventor shall teach watches to think there being fully as much absurdity in the idea of giving mechanism to thought as in that of giving thought to mechanism The remark of  Lord Bacon above quoted may justly be applied to system with attachment to which if a writer is tainted he can never acquire wide and lasting fame which is only to be attained by the productions of a soul free as the mountain winds and large as the universe  LETTER XXXI  OF the numerous writers on truth I know none who hath yet observed that the truth perceivable to human reason may be reduced to two kinds truth of fact and truth of nature  BEFORE I proceed further allow me to tell you an anecdote  SIR WALTER RALEGH when confined in the Tower had prepared the second volume of his immortal history for the press He was standing at the window of his apartment ru∣minating on the office of an historian and on the sacred regard which he ought to pay to truth when of a sudden his attention was ex∣cited by an uproar in the court into which his prospect was directed He saw one man strike another whom by his dress he judged an officer and who drawing his sword run the assailant thro the body who did not however fall till he had knocked down the officer with  his fist The officer was instantly seized while lying senseless and carried away by the ser∣vants of justice while at the same time the body of the man he had murdered was borne off by some persons apparently his friends who with great difficulty pierced thro the vast croud that was now gathered around  NEXT day an acquaintance of Sir Walter called on him a man of whose severe probity and honour Sir Walter was convinced from innumerable proofs and rated his friendship accordingly Ralegh after their first compli∣ments told the story of yesterday's fray which had impressed him deeply as being a spectator of the whole affair What was his surprize when his friend told him that he was perfectly mistaken in his whole story That his officer was no officer but a servant of a foreign am∣bassador that this apparent officer gave the first blow that he did not draw his sword but the other drew it and it was wrested out of his hands but not till after he had run its owner thro the body with it that after this a foreigner in the mob knocked the murderer down in order that he should not escape that  some foreigners had carried off the servant's body and that orders had arrived from court for the murderer to be tried instantly and no favour shewn as the person murdered was one of the principal attendants of the Spanish ambassador 'Sir' says Ralegh  allow me to say that tho I may be mistaken as to the officership of the murderer yet I know of a certainty that all my other circumstances are strictly true be∣cause I was a spectator of the whole transac∣tion which passed on that very spot opposite where you see a stone of the pavement a little raised above the rest  'Sir Walter' says the friend  upon that very stone did I stand dur∣ing the whole affair and received this little scratch in my cheek in wresting the sword out of the fellow's hand and as I shall answer to God you are totally mistaken  You grow warm my friend let us talk of other matters  said Sir Walter and after some other conversation his friend departed  RALEGH took up the manuscript of the second volume of his history then just com∣pleted 'How many falsehoods are here' said he  If I cannot judge of the truth of an event  that passes under my eyes how shall I truly narrate those which have passed thousands of years before my birth or even those that have happened since my existence Truth I sacrifice to thee  The fire was already feed∣ing on his invaluable work the labour of years and he calmly sat till it was utterly consumed and the table ghost of the last leaf flitted up the chimney  FROM this anecdote I illustrate an opinion which I have always held that there is no such thing as truth of fact or historical truth known to man History is merely a species of romance founded on events which really hap∣pened but the bare events as stated by chro∣nologists are alone true their causes circum∣stances and effects as detailed by historians depend entirely on the fancy of the relater Or other truths none are positive to man save those subject to his senses and even these are fallac ous tho the truths they affirm are posi∣tive  as to us  to superior beings our truths are no doubt falsehoods  FROM this observation however a certain species of truth which consists in the relation and connection of things must be exempted providing this may be called positive truth I mean truth of nature or that universal truth to be found in poetry and works of fiction This consists in the propriety and consistence of event of character of sentiment of lan∣guage to be found in such works Want of such propriety and consistence always strikes even a common reader as  false  and absurd Were Achilles instead of fighting Hector to fall on his knees and beg for his life the inci∣dent would strike every one as contrary to  truth  of character I need not use any more instances to illustrate my meaning tho I doubt you will think it rather an uncommon remark that the whole truth known to man and not subject to his senses must be found only in works of fiction Truth was not made for man nor man for truth He is the mere crea∣ture of falsehood on falsehood depend his being his passions his happiness  BY the truth of nature you will perceive I mean that represented and imitated by art  For when we say that an event or character drawn by a painter or poet is not  true  is not  in nature  we imply that art hath relinquished nature art and nature are therefore in this instance almost synonymous terms for we refer the representations of art to that idea of universal nature which every mind acquires in a greater or smaller degree from being daily conversant in her works  A CHARACTER may however be drawn out of the usual progress of nature and yet have truth as the Caliban of Shakspere In this fancy comparing certain ideas of utter rude∣ness of human nature blended with the bestial and demonic the two first drawn from real nature the latter from a continuity of similar notions of these supernatural beings handed down from ages of ignorance to ages of refine∣ment composes from uniting these ideas a certain standard of fitness and propriety of character which is here applied instead of the grand standard of nature This singular cha∣racter is  true to itself  offends no idea of pro∣priety yet is not in nature  OF truth of nature taken in a large sense as applicable to the grand works of nature man can only judge in so far as those concern him It is the nature of the sun to produce heat but were it in time to possess the opposite quality we could not say that  nature was false  but that her effects varied Were we told that the rays of the sun are essentially cold but have the power to effect heat we cannot prove the proposition wrong we only judge from our feelings that the sun warms us and the wisdom that would go further is folly for any prerogative of nature that manifests not its ex∣istence to us we may boldly say hath no exist∣ence The Herschelian planet certainly did not exist to us till it was discovered tho it was ever an attendant of our system How fit we are to judge of the truth of the works of na∣ture may be inferred from the sermon of the Cordelier who desired his audience to admire the superlative wisdom and goodness of God who always makes the greatest rivers to pass by the greatest cities  LETTER XXXII  YOUR wonder at my assertion that the modern stage and drama are superior to the ancient I can only remove by supporting it with evidence To begin with the theatre that of the ancients consisted like ours of a semicircle of which the chord for  the stage behind which were convenience for the actors and the semicircular part contained seats for the spectators The ancient stage of the Greeks comprehended four divisions the  where the reciters of the play stood the  where the actors of the play were stationed the  where the chorus was placed to dance and sing and the  where as with us the musicians held their residence The scene was always the same for each kind of drama The tragedy had a scene consisting of a view of a public place as the court of a palace or the like area surrounded with buildings of magnificent ar∣chitecture  The comic scene always con∣sisted of a public place of domestic architec∣ture and was commonly divided into three parts by two streets opening up from it so that the actors came down these streets to the audience by this mean some passages in an∣cient dramas are accounted for in which per∣haps an actor expresses an ardent and repeated wish to see a person then on the stage that person is then in the other street and cannot be seen by the actor tho he is by the audience The scene of the  or farce was always rural as the satyrs its constant chorus were the fancied inhabitants of the woods The whole machinery of the ancient scene consisted in changing it as either of the dramas were designed for representation  THE vast superiority of the modern scene for real representation the grand object of the drama is so evident that to insist on it were to affront your judgment  NEXT to the scene was the  the  proscenium  or  place before the scene  as the name imports In this the actors or mimics of the  play appeared For you must know that with the ancients the acting of a play was quite a distinct province from the speaking or recita∣tion One set of actors spoke while another accompanied them with proper gestures As the last was thought the most important part of the drama greater honour was paid to the mimics than to the reciters  BELOW the  was the  where the reciters abovementioned took their sta∣tion In this  stood fellows with mon∣strous masks contrived with such large gaping mouths as if they meant to eat all the specta∣tors man woman and child and leave none for tomorrow as Lucian wittily tells us These reciters with the lungs of Thersites rehearsed the piece in musical cadence while the music of the orchestra accompanied them as it did the chorus when their turn came  NEXT to this was the  or place of the chorus whose province you well know and next the audience as with us the  where with the Romans the magistrates and chief men of the city had a superb seat ap∣pointed  for them The emperor's seat was in the midst of the orchestra and called  podium  THE theatre of the Romans differed from that of the Greeks in some respects For ex∣ample the  pulpitum  of the former and  of the latter was sometimes in the Latin theatre of the same elevation with the  pro∣scenium  nay I question if they were not some∣times blended in one The chorus was like∣wise now and then placed in the orchestra The scene of the Romans was sometimes of amazing grandeur that of the theatre of Ma∣rius Scaurus being ornamented with co∣lumns and statues  BOTH in the Greek and Roman theatre the spectators sat in uniform rows of stone seats carried all round the semicircle The multi∣tude of their  vomitoria  or doors is however much to be envied as in case of accident from the number of candles fireworks c employed in our theatres the smallness and fewness of the passages is shockingly cruel and absurd  IN the ancient theatre plays were always represented in broad day and sometimes four tragedies one after another all the work of one author when contending for the prize while next day was set apart for as many of an antagonist These strings of tragedies were called  and  Over the theatre which was open above in case of rain or intense heat of the sun a vast veil could be spread by means of easy machin∣ery this veil was sometimes of the finest silk  SOME contend that the Romans were accus∣tomed to change their scenes during the repre∣sentation of the same piece from a misconception of this passage of Servius in his notes on the third Georgic  Scena quae fiebat aut versilis erat aut ductilis Versilis tunc erat quum subito tota machinis quibusdam convertebatur et aliam picturae faciem ostendebat Ductilis tunc quum tractis ta∣bulariis hac atque illac species picturae nudabatur interior  But this only applies to the change of scene for each drama as above expressed and as may be proved from this clear and positive passage of Vitruvius in the eighth chapter of his fifth book  Genera sunt scenarum tria Unum  quod

speciem deformatis  From this you see that there were only three changes of scene in every ancient theatre and these adapted solely to the different grand kinds of the drama  NEED I descend to particulars to evince the superiority of the modern stage to the an∣cient after this genuine description of the lat∣ter drawn from its cotemporaries Must not the whole representation of the ancients have heaped absurdity upon absurdity The mute action of the mimics guided by the voice of the reciters conveyed thro tubes of brass and  set off with a masque the one side of which expressed grief and the other complacency so that the actor must remember to turn his sad side to the spectators at the proper minute The unnatural declamation accompanied with music The chorus dancing and singing at the intervals c c c How superior is the natural neatness of our dramatic exhibitions which represent life itself to the uncouth mag∣nificence of the ancients To dwell longer on this were needless so I shall pass to the consi∣deration of the drama itself To begin with tragedy  THE fable of ancient tragedy is in compa∣rison with ours amazingly barren and jejune Milton's Sampson is a true picture of most ancient tragedies and we all know what a yawning figure this would make on our stage In most of their pieces there is but one inci∣dent and that contrived with little art as in the Edipus Coloneus where the personages exchange a number of speeches and then one of them dies The only art of the author lies in summoning topics of verbal commiseration The Edipus Tyrannus is indeed an exception  but the horror of the events is too strong and disgusts the mind instead of attracting its sym∣pathy This remark affects not however the art of the author which must be allowed great notwithstanding that the tradition or narrative upon which his piece stands must have helped him in every particular But if art is the chief merit of tragedy then is The Mourning Bride the first of modern tragedies as indeed it is pronounced by a Scotish critic who in poetry knew not the best from the worst Nothing spoils a tragedy more than an intricate plot for no passion can be raised where the judgment always intervenes  IN contrast the modern tragedies seldom have an implex fable but abound with life action incident They interest without per∣plexing and never push the tragic passions to horror and disgust The chorus likewise de∣stroyed the whole moral effect of tragedy by thinking for the spectators who in that case never think for themselves Modern tragedies are far better calculated to mend the heart and manners than the ancient domestic tragedies the most moral and pathetic of all bring ut∣terly  unknown to the ancients who thought that we could not cry except when her ma∣jesty was a blubbering The characters and language of our tragedies must of consequence be more various and interesting  IF in tragedy we excel the ancients still more in comedy and farce Of the Greek comedy of Aristophanes let those speak who have discovered that dung ceases to stink be∣cause it is Athenian Certainly a meaner or dirtier scribbler never disgraced any country than that ancient buffoon he is so totally without merit that to take the trouble of ex∣pressing supreme contempt for him is paying him too great honour What has preserved his pitiful works Style almighty style Of the comedies of Philemon and Menander we have many fragments which shew the insipid mora∣lity with which they were fraught Our sen∣timental comedy is a mere joke to them for soporification The comedies of Terence are translations from theirs and we see how totally destitute they are of the  vis comica  so much so as even to disgust the ancients themselves wit∣ness these verses of the great Caesar preserved by Suetonius  Tu quoque tu in summis O dimidiate Menander  Poneris et merito puri sermonis amator  Lenibus atque utinam scriptis adjuncta foret vis  Comica ut aequato virtus polleret honore  Cum Graecis neque in hac despectus parte jaceres  Unum hoc maceror et doleo tibi deesse Terenti  Intricate plot and artificial ligature of scenes we find in Terence but every thing else is wanting character situation incident wit humour laughter gaiety indeed the whole of that by which comedy is comedy His dramas in short are dramas for mathematicians  THE superiority of our farce to the ancient need not be remarked after the account I lately sent you of the latter The chorus its consist∣ing always of satyrs c are manifest shackles which bound down the ancient farce in the dungeon of dulness  THE duration of the ancient tragic drama I have already pointed out as shorter and pre∣ferable to ours perhaps you will say that the want of incident authorised the brevity of the Greek tragedy But you will remember that I took my instance from the Edipus Tyrannus a play that hath sufficient incident for a modern  drama Since I wrote to you on the duration of the drama I have found the following passage in Cicero which leads me to think that the ancients considered the drama as restricted to three acts It is in the first book of his Letters  Ad Quintium Fratrem  and runs thus  Illud te ad entremum oro et bortor ut tanquam poetae boni et actores industrii solent sic tu  in extrema parte et conclusione  muneris ac negotii tui diligentissi∣mus sis ut hic tertius annus tanquam  tertius ac∣tus  perfectissimus atque ornatissimus fuisse videatur  I think this proof positive and sincerely believe that little Horace like a Sabine puppy was impudent enough to prescribe an absolute rule of poetry from his own skull and that we poor moderns are so weak as to reverence his  ipse dixit  as an oracle which for foundation hath not the shadow of a dream  GRAVINA in his book  Della Tragedia  to which I am much obliged hath well shewn that Aristotle's work on poetry is a crude and indigested performance written by the author in his silly vanity of dictating in every science then known to man Indeed both Victorius and Castelvetro agree with him that this trea∣tise  of Aristotle is full of gross improprieties and absurdities that could only proceed from an author's writing on a subject he knew no∣thing of The book of Longinus on the Sub∣lime is the second ancient work of criticism that hath reached us and in it the Sublime is confounded with the Beautiful and the Tender qualities of writing directly opposite So that little can be said of the perfection of ancient criticism  YOU see I use the privilege of epistolary writing and give you my thoughts as they rise without studying arrangement I hope however I do not go to play till after I have done my business and you know that of this Letter was to shew the superiority of the modern drama to the ancient a point which I hope I have proved to a demonstration almost mathematical  LETTER XXXIII  BOILEAU a writer of the meanest talents whose genius was imitation and whose taste was envy hath said in some one of his feeble labours that he prefers the gold of Vir∣gil to the tinsel of Tasso Now the joke is that Boileau  did not understand one word of Italian  as Voltaire tells us in Le Siécle de Louis XIV Admire the fellow's impudence How impu∣dent ignorance always is As France at that period led the fashions of England both men∣tal and corporeal it is no wonder that Addison one of the best writers and worst critics in the world shut his eyes and followed the French  petitmaitre en critique  ADDISON I am convinced never read Tasso's Gierusalemme as I think it hath lately been pretty well proved that he never read the Aminta Had he perused the works of that wonderful writer he would have blushed to  challenge him for a fault which be never once is blameable of Tasso hath instances of speech too figurative but as little tinsel as Homer He might with equal propriety have said that Milton's works teem with atheism  IN Tasso I remember scarce one false orna∣ment The palace of Armida tho the scene of enchantment is not adorned with decorations of glass but of diamond as strong as it is bril∣liant The bird which sings an amatory ditty that image of the Gierusalemme which ap∣proaches nighest to the bounds of false orna∣ment hath in this view nothing unnatural it is enchantment it is beyond nature and of con∣sequence vindicable nay modest when consi∣dered in its proper point of light Virgil's trees that groan and drop blood without such an excuse I allow tinsical and futile to the last degree As to the language of Tasso tho he wrote in a stanza which must have compelled him to redundance yet I pronounce it as grave and proper with all its riches as that of almost any Greek classic whatever tho the Greeks laboured under no such inconvenience It is the Latins those apes clad in Grecian  cloaths whom we may safely accuse of tinsel or false ornament both of images and language Let us consider a few passages of Virgil al∣lowed their most judicious writer in this view I have never read his Eneid with this intent as would be necessary to give a detail of all the tinsel of it so can only give such passages as at present occur to my memory Indeed I never look into Virgil but with utter disgust while Homer always gives me fresh rapture  I MUST premise that we are not to wonder at Virgil's tinsel for we know that Mecenas whom we look upon as a model of taste and who was Virgil's patron was fond of tinsel to excess Augustus used to rally him always on it as we learn from Suetonius and Macrobius hath preserved a part of a Letter from Augus∣tus to Mecenas running thus  Vale mel gem∣meum Medulliae ebur ex Etruria laser Aretinum adamas supernas Tiberinum margaritum Cilnio∣rum smaragdae jaspi figulorum berylle Porsennae carbunculum Italiae  moecharum  Ah Mecenas what a poor  Mecenas  thou must have been  IN the Eneid Book II The expression  ferit aurea sidera clamor  may justly be arraigned as tinsical and of false brilliance A  cry striking the golden stars  approaches much to glorious nonsense A cry a sound cannot strike save organs of hearing or of reverberation striking the stars is a puerile hyperbole the  golden  stars a yet more puerile epithet on an occasion in which their boundless altitude should have been the idea if an epithet was necessary The  sidera lambit  in the bombast description of Ve∣suvius is of the same family  THE story of Polydorus in the Third Book is perhaps the most unnecessary piece of empty decoration to be found in the works of any writer ancient or modern  IN Book VIII Virgil gives the following receipt to make thunder  Tres imbris torti radios tres nubis aquosae  Addiderant rutili tres ignis et alitis austri  Fulgores nunc terrificos sonitumque metumque  Miscebant operi flammisque sequacibus iras  R Three rays of a wreathed shower three of a watery cloud Add three of red fire and of the winged south wind Mix them up with terrible flashes and with sound and fear and with anger and following fires  HAD this stood in any writer on whom our timid critics dared to exert their judgment what laughter what derision of that tinsical author who could affront the judgment of his readers with such a  caput mortuum  of empty nonsense  IN Book XII the horses  Qui candore nives anteirent cursibus auras  furnish another proof of bad ornament as doth the tree in Book II which threatens its fellers and threatens them by shaking its hair at them  Illa usque minatur  Et tremefacta comam concusso vertice nutar  Perhaps at a leisure hour I may send you more instances but these already adduced will I believe prove that tinsel was a quality of writ∣ing very well known to the Roman Imitator  LETTER XXXIV  ANY observation or discovery which tends to the improvement of our lan∣guage gives me particular pleasure I there∣fore agree with you in your applause of Mr Sheridan's remark that the S which abounds so much in the English orthography hath very often the power of Z Why should it not be written accordingly Why not spell  hiz uz her'z enclozez arizez  c c c I long to see that hissing letter as scarce in the language as possible  THE English tongue is sufficiently strong rich and universal musicalness and softness are the only qualities it wants The greatest praise is therefore due to any writer who at∣tempts to improve its melody Upon many years accurate attention bestowed on our lan∣guage it appears to me that it is to the con∣sonant terminations that the harshness of our speech may be imputed Some words of frequent  occurrence are also very rude and twenty words of very common use will if harsh de∣stroy the tone of a language and if uncouthly spelt will to the eye which ought to be con∣sulted in orthography full as much as the ear injure the  form  of a whole language Such foreigners find our  though through enough rough tough  and all other words in  ugh ughlyheaded monsters  to use Milton's ortho∣graphy which of themselves are sufficient to make our tongue pass for a dialect of the High Dutch How are they surprized to find us pronounce  tho thro enuf ruf tuf  and be at the expence of horrible gutturals to make our language have a hottentot air which gutturals we cannot pronounce In poetry for many a century we have written  tho thro  and so they ought always to be spelt in prose by every per∣son who hath any reverence for the eyes of his readers the  o  in  thro  having the same sound as in  to do  but if any one chuses to spell  throu  I have no objection We should certainly write  ruf enuf tuf brôte thôte nîte  c Why write so many towns With  burgh  do not we pro∣nounce  bura  A little ridicule of sciolists al∣ways attends the first introduction of a novelty  into language tho it should be infinitely for the better but this one must put up with in sure expectation of the praise of posterity and that of enlightened judges of one's own time  THE chief fault of our language is that almost all its words end in consonants The great point is to throw out every final conso∣nant which we can  Alway  for instance is the old spelling of  always  and is better  also  is for the same reason superior to  likewise  which hath the sound of a consonant in its termination I could also wish to see the old  fro  substituted in lieu of  from  the old  ne  for  nor  is better than its substitute If the consonant cannot be re∣jected we should at least soften it if possible and never for example write  has does  but  hath doth  the  th  is frequent in the Greek and is quite melodious Instead of  draws views plays throws  or even  draweth  c I believe a wellwisher to the  tune  of our tongue will write  doth draw doth play  c to preserve such very few words as we have ending in vowelsounds The Greek and Latin and the modern Italian and French have not so many words ending in consonants as we by a great deal A  matter of regret to every admirer of the Eng∣lish language and indeed had not fortunately our adverbs for the most part been taken from the French with the fine vowel termination of  y  but far better in the old spelling  ie  as  namely boldly  c our tongue must have been still more sadly hurt by consonantterminations The great secret of writing melodious English is surely to draw into view every possible word which may terminate with a vowel  COMMON phrases which are ungrammatical a good writer should ever avoid tho they have high authority to support them Such are  methinks today  and the like Dr Arm∣strong in his  Sketches by Launcelot Temple  Esq  hath given us some just observations on our language How the nonsensical phrase  subjectmatter  should be still used in spite of the ridi∣cule he hath entailed on it I cannot conceive He observes that  betwixt  should never be used for  between  To which let me add that it is quite amazing to see an author who hath ears and eyes write  amongst  Gray tho he writes with melody hath  amidst  Are not  among  and  amid  English words  Besides  for  beside  is liable  to the same objection The diphthongs  ae  and  oe  are now unknown to our tongue being trans∣formed into  e  and with great propriety To words spoilt in our spelling may be added the preterite c of some verbs  I read I have read your book  do not we pronounce  redd  and an eminent writer in his familiar letters spells it  redde  The preterite of no verb should be the same with the present else inexplicable confu∣sion will arise but barbarians have formed our tongue and men of science are afraid to meddle with it else why not write  hurted  as well as  parted  c c c However a writer of any precision or elegance will ever write  did hurt  c at least Why should we spell  vanities  c when the singular is  vanity  The plural stood so when the word was spelt  vanitie  and we retain it tho the laziness merely of substitut∣ing one letter for two made some blockhead very improperly write  vanity  Such is the pro∣gress of our language  DR LOWTH in his Grammar seems not to know what to make of  himself  If we say  he came himself  it is nonsense if  he came his self  it is not sense I wish each of our Gothic  ancestors  themselves  had a drubbing to  himself  for inventing such words We use  yourself  in every  case  it would seem we should also say  their selves his self  in all cases if we say  you yourself of yourself to yourself yourself O you yourself by or with yourself  we must of course say  they theirselves of theirselves to theirselves theirselves O they theirselves by or with their∣selves  and  he his self of his self to his self his self O he his self by or with his self Self  in old English is synonymous with  same  as  selve day selve colour  IT is mortifying to every judge of language who must know that the melody and elegance of a tongue depend altogether upon its vowel terminations to reflect that in English not above a dozen common words end in  a  as  villa idea piazza aera quota stanza  and one or two more  lea plea sea  c do not sound as if they ended in  a  In  é  not one word ends nor in  i  In  o  about two dozen as  go to so wo lo stucco tobacco calico portico do cargo echo tho who intaglio ratio solo  c  Whoso  I would recommend to succeed  whosoever  as it preceded in antiquity  whereto hitherto  are bet∣ter  than any substitutes In  u  we have no word whatever and the Romans had very few in  ou  we have only two  thou you  In  y  we have no less than words about an eighth of our lan∣guage our words amounting to about Of this number I would propose that the  é  be restored to all the substantives for instance we should write  beauté treaté ivoré  c as from the French In  w  as a vowel we have a few of the most sonorous words in our language as  flow blow new saw law  c  IT is shocking to remark that we have words ending in  ess  the most horrid of all ter∣minations This is owing to the qualified sub∣stantives in  ness  as  holiness happiness  c most of which may be regarded as obsolete with all my heart for we have  sanctitude felicity  c so that almost every one may be avoided as they always are by good writers But the ne∣gative  less  the great cause of our other termi∣nations in  ess  cannot be so easily thrown out yea a double  ss  is now necessary for we can never write  endles needles  without confusion What shall we say to  hopelessness fearlessness  and other delicious words They may be in  the language but will never be in that of a master of it By the way if we wrote  z  in stead of  s  in many instances we might even spell  needlez  without confusion arising from the plural of  needle  EVERY country schoolmaster and compiler of grammars or dictionaries will tell us that our language is classic and perfect For lo grammars have been written of it within these  twenty  years so that it is stationary and  quite the thing  and a very pretty thing it is My dear friend you know that our language is not yet one century old as to orthography the most essential point of any speech Look into Milton's MSS or his own editions and you will see this at once Now I will hazard a bold opinion namely that our language is now infinitely more barbarous in all respects than it was in the days of Chaucer For me∣lody there is no comparison the  é  always pronounced as in  spoké shaké  c was alone sufficient to render it much more melodious It is truly risible to hear how we talk of our language Did you never read of that village of Spanish  aborigines  discovered by the duke of  Alva's hawk who being quite inclosed with rocky mountains thought there was no world beyond their barriers This is a lively type of our predilection for our native tongue while compared with the Italian or Spanish it is harsh to excess The emperor Charles V we are told said he would talk French to his friend Italian to his mistress and English to his horse I suppose by the bye that in observance of this apophthegm our senators so much frequent the academy of Newmarket in order that by much conversation with their horses they may be qualified to speak good English  HOWEVER it must be allowed that if the English is too harsh the Italian is too soft and it will be easier to soften the English than to harden the Italian The Spanish is not so rich as the English and therefore is inferior For the French I know not what to call it If we call it a language it is as we call the droning of a bagpipe music In pronounciation it is a nasal redundancy of gibberish in writ∣ing it must not be pronounced Silent consonants a phenomenon of nonsense un∣known  to any other tongue under heaven either ancient or modern have such an effect on it that not above twenty words in the whole language are pronounced as they are written In short it is a language which shocks the eye and the ear is incapable of poetry and disagreeable in prose and yet the French have their  classies  How this pitiful tongue hath become so prevalent I cannot ac∣count unless it be in accomplishment of the Scripture  Blessed are the poor in spirit for they shall be exalted  The contest for superiority among the modern tongues I speak without any shadow of prejudice lies between the English and Italian  OF these the English especially hath vast defects and is capable of great improvements But how shall these defects be removed and how shall these improvements be given Very easily We know from the pillar of Duillius that the Latin was in the time of the second Punic war as barbarous as the English is now yet in little more than a century afterward the language of Cicero appeared Here is the point in Greece and Rome men of science  refined and fixed the tongues in England the barbarous blockheads of the lowest mob have corrupted and degraded the language and it is ridicule for a man qualified to judge of it even to give a new spelling In France the speech which was thought fixed hath gone thro in∣numerable changes even in the tenses of verbs such as  etait avait  c used within these twenty years for the old  etoit avoit  c Milton in most of his works adopted the old orthography of English in contempt of the mob of sciolists as he calls them men who know nothing yet judge of every thing without being capable of examining or going further than they did at school But since his time no writer hath had courage to bear up against the vulgar and the consequence is that the head follows the tail  THE plan would be my friend that the king should incorporate one hundred or indeed all of the most learned men in the kingdom or they should associate themselves under the name of  The Academy for Improving the Language  The great intent should be to soften and tune the English speech as much as possible new  modes of spelling and new uses of vowels ought to be adopted The Academy should publish a grammar and dictionary in which the new orthography should be used and all the members and indeed all the  literati  in the kingdom should unite to assert their proper power over the mob I am convinced that in Rome the written language of the vulgar was quite different from that of the learned till a century after Cicero In ancient Greece and in modern Italy the colloquial dialects varied in journeying over every ten miles in both countries the written language of the literati consists of flowers taken from all these dialects Had we a scientific language also it were an admirable institution And perhaps a thousand years hence when the British power may be no more the language would survive an event which it may be feared cannot be effected even by Milton and Shakspere if the speech remains in its present rude state I do not mean that our scientific language should be indebted to our different dialects as the Greek and Italian for I know not of one Scoticism Iricism or provincialism which would contri∣bute in the least to the elegance of our tongue  The sole intention should be to improve our orthography and give us a number of vowelterminations The  é  should in particular be always pronounced as in  the  the Germans pronounce it and were not their speech full of gutturals the consequence would be that it would from this very circumstance prove more melodious than the English I look upon the Greek as the most perfect language both for strength and melody that ever was known now in Greek I have found that the vowel terminations of words taken as they run in any book are equal to one third of the lan∣guage In English the vowel terminations amount but to one fourth of the language it follows that we want vowel terminations for about words How are they to be sup∣plied suppose  a  for all plurals instead of the  s pena  for  pens papera  for  papers  c this would alone furnish us with a sufficiency in  a  This seems the Islandic plural in many cases  skipa  for  ships  c and is thus quite consonant to the genius of our language which is of northern parentage  é  should be given to all substantives  n  y  as  beauté bounté  c and should always be pro∣nounced  in finals as  famé sparé moré gracé  c as of old The  ie  should go to all verbs in  y  as  beautifie  c  i  is a termination unknown to our present tongue tho anciently common Give it to all adject  ves in  y  as  healthi weari  c The  adverbs  in  y  ought alone to retain it as  freely fully  c  o  is a fine close and is very rare in our tongue Suppose it given to all substantives ending in harsh consonants such as those in  b crabo stabo webo  and in  c the publico  c To all substantives in  d  as  commando  c we have a vast number of terminations in  d  and a great part will yet remain and may for it is not a very harsh close The  f  is the Greek φ and we have not many words ending in it so that no alterations need be made  g  is a harsh close save in the very musical  ing  of our participle present c Substantives in  g  should take the  o  as  flago eggo  c The  ch  is shocking and chocking and throwing out the  h  is entitled to  o  even in adjectives as  beeco  for  beech rico  for  rich  c Our other words in  h  may stand the  ish  in particular is pleasing as  standish  a  flourish  c The  ck  is horrid and must omit  the  k  it every instance and take the  o  in all adjectives and substantives as  quaco saco  c The  rk  must take the  o  The  l  is an exquisite final and we have happily a great number The  m  is bad let all substantives take the  o  as  epigramo  c The  n  is not unpleasing the  ion  in particular is excellent All substantives in  p  must take the  o  as  carpo cupo  c To  r  and  s  nothing should be given that can be avoided give all substantives the  o  Substan∣tives in  t  should all take the  o  as  facto  c  BY these alterations and giving the plurals in  a  great melody might be produced which tho uncouth at first would in half a century become familiar and elegant The possessive  s  one of the greatest disgraces of our language ought to be kicked out But how supply its place The  of  or the  belongeth  may supplant it in every possible instance for examples  It is hers  It belongeth to her  Horace's works  The works of Horace In fact the  of  alone is known to other modern languages as a possessive  ON the consonants I have no more to ob∣serve save that our lexicographers are shock∣ingly  mistaken about the  ck  which they call  quite English  tho it is unknown till the latest times In old writers we have  lak  for  lack loc  for  lock  c but never  ck  That man need never go to a concert or look at a picture who can write  Publick Gallick Gothick  c and I would praise him who should begin to write  roc  for  rock tric  for  trick  c Our dictionarymongers are still more grossly igno∣rant with regard to  z  the name of which they say is  izard  that is  s hard  This dream must have occurred to some schoolboy at the very bottom of his form and merits pity The English name in every mouth is  ezed  and well expresses the sound of that fine consonant which every reader of Italian knows to be delici∣ous and superior to that of any consonant save  l  It even bears repetition with more softness than  l  itself as  grandezza bellezza morbidezza  What shall then be said to those teachers who have discovered that it was  s  hard harder than  s  itself If such be the barbarism of writers on our language what must be the barbarism of the language itself If Charles V talked of speaking English to his horse when it had in∣finitely more vowels and only one  s  in words  to which the French stupidity of last century gave two such as  happiness  c because the French forsooth wrote  grandesse  c what would he say of it now He would certainly say he would only talk it to its lexicographers  THE  z  in fact is as much superior to the  s  in sound as the soothing  buz  of a bee is to the horrid  hiss  of a serpent The sound made by the bee is an eternal continuation of that of  z  and hath been reckoned very pleasing by all poets from those who listened to the bees of Hymettus down to Milton  While the bee with honied thie  That at her flowry work doth sing  And the waters murmuring  With such concert as they keep  Entice the dewey feather'd steep  IL PENSOROSO  The  hiss  of a serpent or goose which hath the  s hard  is quite the reverse of pleasing  THE division of inanimate objects into male and female genders is an absurdity from which our tongue is happily free tho it pervades almost all other languages ancient and modern But  to render our speech quite perfect the very natural and necessary accommodation of the adjective to the substantive in plural and singu∣lar ought to be adopted Such as sing  a bad pen  plur  bada pena  bad pens  AS I know that it is impossible to tire you in treating a subject which is so very inter∣esting to every Englishman I shall beg leave to subjoin a paper of the Spectator in the im∣proved language which I would propose  SPECTATOR N  o    WHEN I waz ato Grand Cairo I picked

many of the newmodified words in this specimen will make you smile but as The∣mistocles said to the Spartan general  Strike but hear me  so say I  Smile but hear me  Had Chaucer obtained a prophetic glimpse of our present language perfect as we think it how he would have laughed Ridicule is indeed so far from being the test of truth that no person or object in nature is not capable of being viewed in a ridiculous light Montesquieu observes that women whose understandings are generally weak are the supreme and im∣mediate judges of ridicule Indeed we all know that women and children are the very first to perceive any thing ridiculous in a per∣son  or incident which is of itself a certain proof that ridicule may be defined to be  the effect of an odd sensation produced in very weak minds by the grotesque representation of things which their own feeble or distorted faculties occa∣sion  And it is a certain fact that the weaker and the more minute any mind is the more it is prone to ridicule for we always observe that one fool is the readiest to find out and expose another  I MAKE these remarks merely to guard you against trying me by the laws of ridicule for if so you may laugh and I will think and let us see who will get the better in the end For nothing is so manly as to ridicule ridicule which is itself the most ridiculous thing in the World and I even admire Mr Gray's plan of wearing mustachios for a considerable time to shew that he despised every possibility of ridi∣cule  AFTER this protestation I shall beg leave to offer a few observations more on this very in∣teresting subject  THE number of words in the Greek lan∣guage is about in the Latin about the same By  words  I understand those put as dis∣tinct words in dictionaries  OF modern languages the Italian hath about the French about the Spanish about The English hath about Johnson's Dictionary hath up∣wards of but of these are obso∣lete or never used and all his words from Sir Thomas Brown and other pedants ought to have been omitted The joke is that with him every body is an authority  THE Greek language hath of vowel termi∣nations onethird or words in a  THE Latin the same  THE Italian ninetenths or in  THE Spanish in or twothirds  THE English in or onefourth  OF all these you see the English comes highest the Greek and Roman even now in vowel terminations and in initial and medial  vowels they may be regarded as equal The English is therefore at present the most perfect of modern languages even in sound  BUT to give a language more perfect in me∣lody than any yet seen the number of conso∣nant and vowel terminations ought to be equal This the plan I have just proposed would effect to every possible degree  DID you ever observe that  n r  and  t  are so frequent in our tongue as in a fount of letters to require triple the number of almost any other consonant The  r  is very harsh and wherever any of them can be turned out the better tho the  t  be a very soft vowel and the  n  hath a fine silver sound  IT may strike you that the plural in  a  might have an effect like the supernumerary  a  in bur∣lesque songs as  He was a gallant knighta  c But this very singularity of a superfluous vowel unknown to other languages proves that we want terminating vowels to the melody of our tongue and that  a  is chiefly wanted  LASTLY most of the alterations in the spe∣cimen are not  innovations  but  restorations of ou  ancient language  SINCE I am treating the improvement of language give me leave to add a very few re∣marks on the present Greek characters used in printing which are in a shocking state indeed  ALDUS and the other printers who first printed Greek adopted at once the most bar∣barous characters then used by the Greek ama∣nuenses Hence the first Greek characters are worse than the Roman tho the later are very unshapely By a singular fatality the Roman character hath been improved and brought to supreme elegance while the Greek hath got worse and worse The abominable contrac∣tions which appear in almost every word of the first editions of Latin books are now no where to be found The more abominable contractions and distorted letters of the early Greek editions still exist in all their glory  COMMON sense Common sense what an uncommon thing art thou  THE strange letters and contractions now used in the Greek are no older than the tenth century as may be seen in Montfaucon's  Palaeographia Graeca  They were introduced by most barbarous monks in the most barba∣rous age and we more barbarous than the most barbarous retain them Before that period of deep ignorance the Greek was all written in elegant and formal CAPITALS of which fine specimens exist such as the Alexandrian Old and New Testament in the British Muse∣um and others After that the Greek ama∣nuenses  as they called themselves began to use small characters in imitation of the copiers of Latin as would seem and to study to unite them They were ignorant that the genius of the Greek and Roman written character is quite distinct and that he who attempts to bind the Greek letters to one ano∣ther will totally destroy any shadow of their form This they might have learned from the very first attempts as we observe in the epistle of a Byzantine emperor to a king of France given in  fac simile  by Montfaucon which re∣sembles the Arabic much more than the Greek Modern Greeks find it impossible to give a ligature to more than two letters in writing and even then the form is injured to write three without quite annihilating the character  I will venture to pronounce an impossibility Some of these contractions and ligatures have been of shocking consequence to the sense of authors as Montfaucon shews and even now it takes a keen eye to discern between ς  s  and ς  st  This strange jumbling of characters to∣gether hath been one grand cause of the total barbarism in which we now see the Greek Another grand cause arises from the horrible contractions Now the joke is that all these contractions are elongations It will take a man far longer to write them than the letters they represent They put me in mind of for  and of a contraction I have seen on a sign∣post in a village ALEXANDERE BROWN Yet to these blessed contractions and ligatures is it owing that the present Greek character is more ugly than that of any language whatever tho at first it was as distinct and elegant as the Roman  THE restoration of the Greek characters were very easy and yet a printer would gain immortality by it Let us see  THE present Greek capitals are  Of these I only object to two the Θ and Ξ both of Which hurt the eye very much because the parts of them are detached and broken asunder They occur of several forms in old Greek in∣scriptions and manuscripts but I prefer those marked in the little sketch annexed which are much more pleasing to the eye the Ω is far better in the form of fig as mark∣ing  o long  BUT it is in the small Greek alphabet that supreme improvements may be made and I subjoin such a one as I think the best after consulting many MSS c on the occasion The present ζ and ξ in particular are horrible apothecaries marks For both I give their capitals with a slight variation in the former It must be remarked that the small Greek let∣ter never admits of what letterfounders call a  ceriph  or line across the terminations as the Roman  IN some books printed at Basil by  Curio  and others about an Italic Greek characte  appears with much elegance allowing for con∣tractions and ligatures This if the printers please may be called  Basil Greek  As I think this variety would be as elegant and useful in the Greek as in the Latin and modern tongues I have likewise given an alphabet of it The twentyfour small Greek characters which I have given I need hardly add will answer every possible use fully as well as the twentyfour common large Greek characters or as all the contractions and ligatures in the world tho as an eminent letterfounder informs me they amount to about  three hundred even now in daily use  As to the Greek accents every one knows that they are more useless if possible than the ligatures and contractions The mark of aspi∣ration ought alone to be retained and made of some  body  and apart as what is called a  superior  letter in whatever form is most agreeable for MSS and printed books differ but the best seems to be a small Roman h turned back∣ward as that marked In the Alexandrian Bible thought to be of the th or th century the only note like an accent is a dot over the  γ  Nor can accents be traced higher than the th or th century when they appeared along with contractions and ligatures True it is that a Greek manuscript was lately found at Herculaneum with  accents  that is the acute accent was put  upon every vowel  A practice just as rational as any other in this way The Germans alone of all modern European na∣tions read the Greek by the accents and say  for instance not  so that the power of the  omega  is lost and it is confounded with  omicron  Nay the modern Greeks all read by the accents in which they shew total igno∣rance of the Greek Nor let this be wondered at for who of us knows how Chaucer pro∣nounced English The slender  a  so common in our language is not fo old as Elizabeth's time Le Maurier in his  Memoires de la Hollande  tells us that Elizabeth pronounced French ill saying  maa foi  and  paar Dieu  A sensible antiquary observes that now she would have said  mai foi  and  per Dieu Dance France  with a thousand more words in which the  a  slender now appears were formerly written as pronounced  Daunce Fraunce  c Nothing fluctuates so much as language and  he that looks for ancient Greek among the modern Greeks will find himself mistaken They have altered the sound of almost every vowel nay have gone so far as to give the  eta  the sound of  epsilon  and the reverse They say  for  and  for  c  BY the bye it is surprizing that not one Englishman save Milton seems to have disco∣vered that the English pronounciation of the Latin is improper The  a  in Latin is always broad as is the  e  The  i  has the power of our  e  slender The Romans did not pronounce  satyetas  but  sachietas  c c c Milton ordered his daughters to read to him accord∣ingly as we find in his Life by Birch Indeed it is as absurd to read Latin in English as to read French so  BEFORE I give you my Greek alphabet which is not new I assure you but very an∣cient I shall just observe that one or two of the Latin characters might be improved or rather restored Such is the a which would be far more elegant if given in the form used in writing See that marked * The small  belly is very disagreeable to the eye and the other would be far more round and beautiful The g is still worse and hurts the eye very much It should be given as that marked † or that with § The other characters are very neat and pleasing The dot over the i might however be spared as quite unnecessary and only serving to injure the beauty and regularity of the line Printers seem at a loss for marks of annotation and even those they use are get∣ting more and more ugly particularly the cross † and double cross ‡ which have unfor∣tunately been called  dagger  and doubledagger and some  learned  letterfounders have now be∣gun to form them accordingly The § is not a proper notationmark as it implies  section  and is daily used in the true sense The * is the only decent mark left and this like all the others is made four times the size it should be It is impossible to make those marks too small for it is only necessary to see them and every eye can see even a  point  They ought always to be very minute and  superior  As I look upon the smallest parts of this superlative art as important I annex some new marks of annotation and the proper form of the cross and double cross  THO I wish to see variations for the better in the English language yet be assured that there cannot be a variation even for the better in the sincere speech of friendship with which I am c    Θ    Ζ    Ω    ••  *  •  g  •  g  Heart  •  Diamond  ◊  Circlet  •  Rose  •

one species which hath escaped you and that is where an author writes in a style that might well give delight to the learned and yet by some strange chance or other his reputation is only in the mouths of common readers I have a singular instance of this to produce in a poem which I am confident you never heard of but which yet possesses a merit superior to that of many pieces of the very first celebrity It hath passed thro eight editions from the year when it was published to the present time yet hath never been mentioned in any critical work whatever The style is so much that of Shak∣spere that had he written in this species of poetry he could have adopted no other To detain your curiosity no longer this wonderful production is called THE GRAVE A POEM and is written by Robert Blair who was all episco∣pal clergyman in Edinburgh  AS I am sure you have never seen it I beg leave to lay before you some of its most beauti∣ful passages in order to raise your expectation to the highest ere I send you the poem itself I admire this poem so much that I have pro∣cured most of the editions of it from the first to the last they have various readings and I will send you a copy with the most remarkable written on the margin In the mean time in copying my extracts I have preferred the readings which I thought best  SOON after a proper introduction the follow∣ing striking passage appears  See yonder hallow'd fane the pious work  Of names once fam'd now dubious or forgot  And buried midst the wreck of things which were  There lie interred the more illustrious dead  The wind is up Hark how it howls Methinks  Till now I never heard a sound so dreary  Doors creak and windows clap and night's foul bird  Rook'd in the spire screams loud the gloomy aisles  Black plaister'd and hung round with shreds of scutcheons  And tatter'd coats of arms send back the sound  Laden with heavier airs from the low vaults  The mansions of the dead Rouz'd from their slumbers  In grim array the grizly spectres rise  Grin horrible and obstinately sullen  Pass and repass hush'd as the foot of Night  Again the screechowl shrieks ungracious sound  I'll hear no moreit makes my blood run chill  THE following picture is a very natural and fine one  OFT in the lone churchyard at night I've seen  By glimpse of moonshine chequering thro the trees  The schoolboy with his satchel in his hand  Whistling aloud to bear his courage up  And lightly tripping o'er the long flat stones  With nettles skirted and with moss o'ergrown  That tell in homely phrase who lie below  Sudden he starts and hears or thinks he hears  The sound of something purring at his heels  Full fast he flies and dares not look behind him  Till out of breath he overtakes his fellows  Who gather round and wonder at the tale  Of horrid apparition tall and ghastly  That walks at dead of night or takes his stand  O'er some newopen'd grave and strange to tell  Evanishes at crowing of the cock  This pleasing picture is finely contrasted by the following affecting one which immedi∣ately follows it  THE newmade widow too I've sometimes spy'd  Sad sight slow moving o'er the prostrate dead  Listless the crauls along in doleful black  While bursts of sorrow gush from either eye  Fast falling down her now untasted cheek  Prone on the lowly grave of the dear man  She drops while busy meddling memory  In barbarous succession musters up  The past endearments of their softer hours  Tenacious of its theme Still still she thinks  She sees him and indulging the fond thought  Clings yet more closely to the senseless turf  Nor heeds the passenger who looks that way  IN the above description there are many minute strokes that infer the superior poet  her now untasted cheek She drops  to adopt the sound to the action  busy meddling memory  an expression so perfectly Shaksperian yet not of Shakspere  THE following passage is equal to any of the most admired moral parts of Shakspere and in the true manner of that wonderful dramatist  DULL grave thou spoil'st the dance of youthful blood  Strikest out the dimple from the cheek of mirth  And every smirking feature from the face  Branding our laughter with the name of madness  Where are the jesters now the men of health  Complexionally pleasant Where the droll  Whose every look and gesture was a joke  To clapping theatres and gaping crouds  And made ev'n thicklipp'd musing Melancholy  To gather up her face into a smile  Before she was aware Ah sullen now  And dumb as the green turf that covers them  THIS description is likewise purely and per∣fectly Shaksperian  BUT see the wellplum'd herse comes nodding on  Stately and slow and properly attended  By the whole sable tribe that painful watch  The sick man's door and live upon the dead  By letting out their persons by the hour  To mimic sorrow when the heart's not sad  How rich the trappings now they're all unfurl'd  And glittering in the sun Triumphant entries  Of conquerors and coronation pomps  In glory scarce exceed Great gluts of people  Retard th' unwieldy show while from the casements  And houses tops ranks behind ranks close wedg'd  Hang bellying o'er  Live upon the dead  is a pitiful antithesis but Shakspere would have used it  ADMIRE this masterly passage  Beauty thou pretty plaything dear deceit  That steals so softly o'er the stripling's heart  And gives it a new pulse unknown before  The grave discredits thee Thy charms expung'd  Thy roses faded and thy lilies soil'd  What hast thou more to boast of Will thy lovers  Flock round thee now to gaze and do thee homage  Methinks I see thee with thy head laid low  While surfeited upon thy damask cheek  The highfed worm in lazy volumes roll'd  Riots unscar'd  CONTRAST the above description with the following  What groan was that I heard Deep groan indeed  With anguish heavy laden Let me trace it  From yonder bed it comes where the strong man  By stronger arm now vanquish'd gasps for breath  Like a hardhunted beast How his great heart  Beats thick his roomy chest by far too scant  To give the lungs full play What now avail  The strongbuilt sinewy limbs the wellspread shoulders  See how he toils for life and lays about him  Mad with his pain Eager he catches hold  Of what comes next to hand and grasps it hard  Just like a creature drowning Hideous sight  Oh how his eyes stand out and stare full ghastly  While the distemper's rank and deadly venom  Shoots like a burning arrow thro his bowels  And drinks his marrow upHeard you that groan  It was his last  THE passage on the death of the philoso∣pher is exceeding well as is that on the phy∣sician but I need not repeat every beauty this stroke in the last is quite Miltonic  From stubborn shrubs  Thou wrung'st their shy retiring virtues out  And vex'd them in the fire  THE sexton I must not forget He is a bro∣ther of him in Hamlet but far from a servile imitator  See yonder maker of the deadman's bed  The sexton hoaryheaded chronicle  Of hard unmeaning face down which ne'er stole  A gentle tear With mattock in his hand  He digs thro rows of kindred and acquaintance  By far his juniors Scarce a scull's cast up  But well he knew its owner and can tell  Some passage of his life Thus hand in hand  The sot has walk'd with death twice twenty years  And yet no youngster on the green laughs louder  Or clubs a smuttier tale When drunkards meet  None sings a merrier catch or lends his hand  More willing to his cup Poor wretch he minds not  That soon some trusty brother of the trade  Shall do for him what he has done for thousands  This comparison applied to time is Shakspere again  Yet treads more soft than e'er did midnight thief  Who slides his hand under the miser's pillow  And carries off his prize  No simile can exceed the following for pastoral and elegant simplicity Among the various tenants of the grave he enumerates  The longdemurring maid  Whose lonely unappropriated sweets  Smil'd like you knot of cowslips on the cliff  Not to be come at by the willing hand  I SHALL conclude with another simile of equal merit near the close of the poem which consists of about lines He is mentioning the aversion even of the good to death tho they place eternal happiness as a certainty be∣yond it  So have I seen upon a summer's eve  Close by the rivulet's brink a youngster play  How wishfully he looks to stem the tide  This moment resolute next unresolv'd  At last he dips his foot but as he dips  His fears redouble and he runs away  From th' inoffensive stream unmindful now  Of all the flowers that paint the further bank  And smil'd so sweet of late  I CANNOT close my Letter without remark∣ing that there is no poem in which the verse and phrase of Shakspere are so well followed in their very spirit as this The diction is frugal and chaste yet upon occasion highly poetical without any appearance of research In short I recommend it to you without hesitation as one of the very first poems in the English lan∣guage  LETTER XXXVI  A POET may doubtless be too much an antiquary when treating an ancient subject but he may likewise be too little so and the last fault is the most common tho both extremes are equally prejudicial If a poet hath too little science of antiquity his ignorance disgusts and if he hath or rather shews too much his pedantry is nauseous  THE study of antiquity hath always appeared to me very uncertain more especially that relating to the ages before the Greek classics flourished and after the Roman period of litera∣ture was succeeded by long centuries of gloomy ignorance The strong light which the Greek and Roman authors cast around them serves to expose the most minute custom to the eye but in the night that succeeded any object must be very large indeed if it strikes our view till the morning of science again broke toward the beginning of the sixteenth century  THE period preceding the Greek classics is left to the full flight of the poet's imagination providing he errs not against the  costume  of such nations as are described by ancient historians The latter period which is indeed the period of chivalry when the feudal system gave new forms to society confines the poet more yet leaves a vast field for bold fiction  THE customs and manners of feudal times were perfectly similar in most countries The knight who traversed the wild heaths and mountains of Scotland was the same in his armour his manners his pursuits with him who paced over the fragrant vallies of Spain They had travelled to the same courts fought in the same tourneys and perhaps adored the same mistress Their castles were built much in the same manner and alike situated on an insulated rock surrounded by a gloomy torrent or on a commanding hill The manners of the Spanish knight might be imputed by any poet with strict propriety to the Scotish and the contrary If such poet were to describe a castle in England or Scotland and it turned out to be upon the French Italian or Spanish model  might it not be said with great justice that there must have been many such castles ac∣tually existing the founders of them having preferred such models to those of their own country Are there not many peers in Great Britain at this moment who build their houses and live in every point after foreign fashions Hence you see the absurdity of a poet's restrict∣ing himself too much to mere local antiquity When fashion caprice and accident are as an∣cient as any antiquities in the world  INDEED no science whatever proceeds upon such uncertain grounds as that of the antiquities of the respective countries of the world during the middle ages Our authori∣ties are those of romances in which for aught we know customs may be described which had no real existence on purpose to increase the marvellous and those of historians of cre∣dulous faith and mean information Much scope is therefore left to the poet and if he errs not against the  costume  of greater notoriety he is as likely to be right as any historian or romancewriter of the times for one will see objects more distinctly with a good telescope  tho at some miles distance than a person with bad natural organs of vision can upon the spot If a poet for instance were to describe English cuirassiers at the battle of Azincour tho some monkish historian were positively to say that there were none I should prefer the poet's tes∣timony to that of the cotemporary dunce be∣cause we have no relation of that battle by any writer who was present if there was such relation the writer might have omitted the circumstance from spite at some officer of those cuirassiers or from forgetfulness or the rela∣tion itself might be altered and corrupted If no faith is due on such a particular point to an eye witness what is due to a monkish his∣torian who heard it from an old woman who heard it from a serjeant who was at the battle If a poet were even to describe the French king as charging our troops on that occasion with his men drawn up in the Grecian phalanx who shall confute him Is it not at least as probable as that there is in the British army a regiment of cavalry who wear helmets of Greek form yet the last is a fact Fortune delights to blend times and circumstances as much as to alter them  NOTHING can be more risible than to see a professed antiquary from some scrap of an ancient writer deciding upon the manners and customs of a whole country and century when perhaps the particular custom mentioned was confined to a dozen of people and totally va∣nished in six weeks I wish the Memoirs of Scriblerus had extended to the feudal times that the vapid studies of the mere antiquary might have been as much exposed to ridicule in respect to those as to the times of Greece and Rome  LETTER XXXVII  YOUR detestation of modern Latin poetry cannot well exceed mine yet were all the works of it to be thrown into the fire as you propose there are one or two that I would risk burning my fingers to redeem The Basia of Secundus would be one of these and indeed the only entire work in other authors I should be content with two or three select leaves These leaves should be torn only from the poems of Casimir Sorbiewsky with one leaf from those of Menage tho not written by that author being the fable of Love and Folly by the Pere Commire I would transcribe it but it is rather long and Menage's poems are not uncommon so shall content myself with recommending it to your perusal after observ∣ing that it is in the simple style of Phaedrus which you so deservedly admire By the way here is a pretty French poem with the same title tho of a very different subject It is by the noted Piron and if you have not seen it you will thank me for it  L'AMOUR ET LA FOLIE  J'avois

eighteen and consequently of little maturity of judgment happened to light upon him at some dull hour  when insipidity itself appears bright liked him and praised him to the skies in his Essay on Criticism That work became popular and there is the whole of the mystery You know Pope loved modern Latin poetry so much as to publish the Selecta Poemata Italorum in two volumes a work that does still less credit to his critical abilities than his edition of Shakspere  I HAVE said that in my opinion I will not say  humble  for that is a proud word the Basia of Secundus two or at most three odes of Casimir and the fable of Commire constitute all the modern Latin poetry that merits pre∣servation and I have read the poems of Fra∣castorius Amaltheus Buchanauus Grotius Heinsius and all the men in  us  as Moliere calls them that ever scribbled together with those of all the names in any other syllable whatever to the number of many hundreds They are all so many carcases of the respective countries drest in Roman habits Behold a tolerable epigram upon those of Italy  IN ITALOS POET AS RECENTIORES LATINE SCRIBENTES  Vatibus hic mos est Italis ut mille smaragdos  Ut mille intexant versibus astra suis  Nil praeter flores aurum marmorque loquuntur  Nil radios praeter lunave solve tuos  Denique versiculis in Tuscis omnia bella  Excipias ipsos si modo versiculos  HAVE you read Casimir I am pretty cer∣tain your contempt for Latin poetry has hin∣dered you At any rate allow me to send you one of his odes indeed the very best insornuch that upon reading it I do not wonder at the high opinion Grotius expresses of the author namely that he always equals and often sur∣passes Horace I shall beg leave to subjoin to it a translation of my own upon a new plan syllable for syllable a little in the manner of Milton's translation of  Quis te puer gracilis sub antro  save that Milton and his followers in this stanza have only adopted the mechanic form not the syllabication which I shall reli∣giously preserve Read and admire  AD SUAM TESTUDINEM  Sonori buxi filia sutilis  Pendebis alta barbite populo  Dum ridet aer et supinas  Solicitat levis aura frondes  Te sibilantis lenior halitus  Perflabit Euri me juvet interim  Collum reclinasse et virenti  Sic temerè jacuisse ripâ  Eheu Serenum quae nebulae tegunt  Repente coelum quis sonus imbrium  Surgamus Heu femper fugaci  Gaudia praeteritura passu  Now for the translation Read and judge  TO HIS HARP  Sonorous daughter of the pliant boxen stem  On the high poplar O my harp thou shalt depend  While laughs the sky and the gale  Softly revives the listless leaves  The western wind will solicit with gentlest breath  The music of thy charming strings I the mean while  Lost in sweet ease will recline  Along the green of this fair bank  Alas what sudden clouds invade the sunny sky  What unexpected showers in sounding haste descend  Let us be gone Ah how soon  Will happiness still pass away  In the original I do not like  testudinem shell  when it appears from the first line to be made of box nor the epithet  sutilis  which implies  patched  or  sewed together  not  capable of being wrought into musical or other instruments  which must have been the author's idea and which perhaps I have not strongly expressed by  pliant Sibilantis  is unhappy so I think is  collum  The last stanza is faultless  HIS sixteenth Ode of the Second Book is likewise fine but not equal to this How do you like this passage in Ode IX Book III It is addrest to a lady  Non indecorae nube modestiae  Extinguis aurum vilius aspici  Gemmasque nolentes latere  Moribus ingenioque celas  Hinc inde rubris Creta coralliis  Illinc smaragdis fulguret India  Cum pura Virtus fulsit omnes  In tenebris latuere gazae  THE th Ode of the same Book  Ad Apes Barberinas  is extremely pretty Here it is for it is very short  breve plerumque quod elegans  I deny the apophthegm however if applied  ad genus foemininum  Cives Hymetti gratus Atticae lepos  Virgineae volucres  Flavaeque Veris filiae  Gratum fluentis turba praedatrix thymi  Nectaris artifices  Bonaeque ruris hospitae  Laboriosis quod juvat volatibus  Crure tenus viridem  Perambulare patriam  Si Barberino delicata principe  Secula melle fluunt  Parata vobis secula  Need I tell you that the arms of Urban VIII of the house of Barberini then the reigning pontiff were three bees Urban was himself no mean poet in the Latin way and must have been much pleased with this fine allusion to his armorial bearing indeed the happiest of the kind which I remember to have read  THE eighteenth Ode of the Fourth Book  Ad Rosam  has been quoted by James Hervey of religious memory The full address is  Ad Rosam quotannis kal Junii Divae Virginis caput coronaturus  The two first stanzas are exquisite if you except one line the second of the second stanza Chariots with four horses  by the way seem a favourite inage of this writer and spoil many of his personifications  Siderum sacros imitata vultus  Quid laces dudum rosa delicaum  Effer e terris caput O tepentis  Filia coeli  Jam tibi nubes fugiunt aquosae  Quas fugant albis Zephyri quadrgis  Jam tibi mulcet Borean jocantis  Aura Favoni  I moreover don't like  e terris  roses never spring from the ground but fron the rosier The rest containing the religious part is as usual foolish enough  THE twentythird of this Book  Ad Cieadam  is likewise elegant but the idea  s too similar to that of the superlative ode first produced  WE may with propriety conclude our little treat from this writer with these lines of Ode Book IV After a prophecy of the fu∣ture happiness of Poland his naive country he tenderly closes thus  tunc mea carmina  Discenda grandaevi parentes  Virginibus puerisque dicent  Frustra nam in urna surdus et immemor  Jacebopulvis Me tamen integrae  Laui coronabunt jacentem et  Cirum hederae violaeque serpent  In a word had the judgment of Casimir Sorbi∣ewsky equaled his imagination he would have been one of the fist lyric poets in the world  Do not think however that when in my enumeration of the very few modern Latin poems that merit praise I omitted Mr Gray's Ode  Oh t  severi religio loci  I meant to leave it in the flames On the contrary I know you would burnyour Horace ere you would put it there But leigh ho I wish it had been in Eng∣lish which would have saved me the trouble of putting  t in a poor English dress after the manner of my former translation of an Alcaic ode of Casmir However such as it is you shall have i    Oh thou th  stern religion of this severe place for sure  By whate'ername thou lovest to be call'd  No mean d  ty must hold  These native streams and ancient groves  And more is seen the presence of some awful god  Amid those pathless rocks and uplands wild  Broken cliffs and raging streams  And horrors of the woody night  Than beneath the citron roof if pomhously shrin'd  In luxury of gold he shone and Phidian art  All hail hear my rev'rent vows  Indulge with rest my weary youth  Oh if cruel fortune forbids me to enjoy  Tho much I wish in vain thy seats of calm delight  And law of holy silence  Resorbing me in violent waves  At least Oh father grant me in some nook remote  To wear away the free hours of my peaceful age  Secure from vulgar tumult  Conceal'd by thee and human cares  THIS exquisite Ode is by no means in the Alcaic measure which Mr Gray seems to have intended it for The Alcaic measure as used by Horace consists of six feet or twelve syl∣lables in the two first lines three feet and a half or seven syllables in the third and four feet or eight syllables in the fourth But what occasion is there to restrict modern poets to ancient measures tho writing in a ancient  tongue when they may use what measures they please in modern languages Are not the stanza and construction of Mr Gray fully as harmonious to our ears as those of Horace The rest is pedantry Yet I remember to have once had a dispute with the first of our living poets upon this very topic but as we could not use the  ratio ultima regum  and thought it below us to lay wagers having the fear of Hudibras before our eyes the fire went out after we had exhausted our fuel  LETTER XXXVIII  ISHALL now beg leave to conclude my remarks on the last edition of the plays of Shakspere  Vol VIII p The commentator tells us gravely that  fear  is personified in this pas∣sage of Exodus  I will put a fear in the land of Egypt  He might as well have said  will put  or any other word in the sentence is per∣sonified Such criticisms make one quite sick Hypecacuanha is a jest to thoughts that shew an absence of common understanding  P Stare at this note '  at mount  i e Mount  Misenum At mount  is  ready to mount our horses  as a child would see from the con∣text  P Warburton's note marked is worthy of the author as is that marked in P  Nomen ipsum stultitia  P The beautiful lines of Ben Jonson may be dedicated to Cloaca along with his other works Poor critic to praise as beauti∣ful poetry in which tho consisting of only five lines there are two false images and three false metaphors A fit commentator on Shak∣spere  P  His friends like physicians thrive  only means his friends  act  like physicians and give him over  Thrive  is commonly used in this acceptation in the north  How the stupid play of  Titus Andronicus  comes always to appear among Shakspere's I cannot imagine Dr Percy a superlative judge of these matters tells us that it is not his but only corrected by him Even the annotators of this edition in their notes at the end of the play shew by many arguments that it is not Shakspere's Why not then in the name of God throw it into the fire Will no editor shew taste enough to deliver us from nonsense that would disgrace a bedlamite to write or to read  Vol IX TROILUS AND CRESSIDA p  Varlet  is another name for page  gros varlets  a term for inferior servants  Il y eut huit mille cheveliers et escuyers et gens de traits et  gros varlets

encreased if it be drunke with moderation so such as are of merie dispositions enjoy a natural wine in their bodies especially harts and braines which causeth them to laugh a  the wagging of a feather and without just matter of laughter without modest regard of circum∣stance to beare themselves light and ridicu∣lous And this my friende I tape to be the cause of  merrie greeks  who seek rather to discharge themselves of the jocond affection  stirred up by their humour then require true outward occasion of solace and recreation  A Treatise of Melancholie By T Bright Doc∣tor of Phisicke London printed by Vautrolier    p    I AM apt to think that Shakspere had read this book with much care I know not if he derived his idea of the spleen being the cause of laughter which he often uses in his works from any other source  P  Cre  Will he give you the  nod  Pand  You shall see  Cre  If he do the rich shall have more  This alludes to the common phrase of calling a blockhead a  noddy  Cressida's reply means if he gives you  nod  who are already a  noddy  it is like giving more to the rich Such is the pun meant by Shakspere heaven knows poor enough  P The character of  blockish  Ajax is drawn from every pamphlet every old woman every schoolboy  P  Fitt  not only signified  part  of a song c as Dr Percy hath shewn but even part of a discourse or other work in prose In  The Examination of John Philpot  formerly quoted fig  B  at the end of his third exa∣mination we find  Thus far the thyrde fytte  P III 'Wear this sleeve' No antiquary hath explained if it was the complete sleeve of alady's gown that her knight used to wear in combat or tournament I suppose it was only what is called the  cuff  The custom is evident from a thousand romances In the Spanish such sleeve is called  la manga  It was com∣monly richly embroidered by the lady with her own cypher and other devices  P  Paid  is  beat  not  punished  The phrase is common in the north in this accep∣tation  KING LEAR p  Old course is the course of an old man  P 'My worthy arch and patron' is a Latinism in which the component members of a word are separated for  my worthy and  archpatron  Horace has such separations Or  arch  may here mean  support  as arches sup∣port an edifice as it evidently does in the pas∣sage quoted from Heywood  P 'An onetrunkinheriting slave' every body sees is a poor fellow who inherits one trunk only from his father or who only  possesses  one trunk for so Shakspere sometimes uses  inherit  P  Do you but mark how this be∣comes comes the house  I do not wonder this non∣sense hath puzzled all the commentators not excepting the nonsensereading andexpounding Steevens Shakspere wrote  Do you but mark how this becomes the  nonse  ie the  nonce  the  occasion  a word frequent to our ancient poets but unknown to some ignorant corrector of the press on the first printing of Lear who accordingly like other of Shakspere's emenda∣tors altered it to such nonsense as he at least could understand  P 'Age is unnecessary' The com∣mentators on this fine stroke are much to be  pitied To every mind of sensibility its mean∣ing starts at once and fills the eye with tears its best illustrators 'Age is unnecessary' why should I be old would Lear say Your cruelty he is speaking to his daughters your cruelty and my miseries shew that age is now without respect and without happiness  Age is un∣necessary  O death why didst not thou pre∣vent this unnecessary evil  P ''Tis foul' This every boy knows applies to the storm  P 'Leap upright' How the duce should this require explanation except from such commentators as Warburton whose muddy brains could dirty the clearest speech Edgar says he is so near the precipice that for all beneath the moon he would not leap up∣right for even in doing so the slight bend which his body would make would throw him over or the fallacious brink crumble be∣neath his feet  Vol X ROMEO AND JULIET p Shakspere never uses the law term of  the same  in any even the prose parts of his play  Theobald's correction is doubtless right  sunne  and  same  would be quite similar in old writing The lines in this edition are pitiful in Theo∣bald's exquisite  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air  Or dedicate his beauty to the sun  P The earthquake is a mere stroke of fancy and it is worthy of a right antiquary to find it in history and in England in  P The ridicule of Shakspere which may occur in low writers it is superlative ridicule in an annotator to place in new light after it was lost in the darkness of dulness  P The  gossamer  is the web of young spiders who mean to rise in the air to catch flies and spin a number ere they produce one in whose strength they can confide  P The reading of  life  for  wife  con∣tradicted by the next line in the text where Juliet answers  That may be Sir when I may be a  wife  It is seriously recommended to future  commentators  derived from  commentum  on Shakspere that they read two lines before they pretend to explain one  P In the name of Scriblerus good Mr Steevens pray give us your notes on Vir∣gil Publish an edition  cum notis variorum  i e  stultorum  Among them will shine your remark on  Venus  and  Dea  Some boy of taste will however laugh at your  erudition  and tell you that  Dea  is one of the best strokes in Virgil as it attends the exertion of godlike power  P Read 'flattering  ruth  of sleep' not  truth  If I may trust the flattering pity of sleep  Ib  Bosom's lord  every boardingschool miss knows means  soul mind  P  Nice  occurs often in Chaucer and in the Tale of Beryn for foolish It is from the French being used very often in the  Roman de la Rose  in the glossary to which  Amsterd  vols  mo  is this explanation  nice sot  sans

dream is a mere fiction of a cunning servant who was afraid of being punished if he confest his seeing the fray as he did without interfering to prevent bloodshed  HAMLET p Polack is from the French but the annotator seems not to know that  polaque  in French is the same with  polacre  a coasting vessel It is in old French that  Polaque  is equivalent to  Polonois  a Polander Montaigne in his Travels Paris speak∣ing ing of the Pope  Outre cela il a basti des collieges pour les Grecs pour les Anglois Escossois François pour les Allemands et pour les  Polacs  The editor's note on the last word is  Les Polonois On ecrit  Polaques  et ce nom vient de la Polaquie qui est le Pa∣latinat de Bielsko  Montaigne wrote about Shakspere's time tho his Travels which are indeed not worth publishing were never printed till  P The superstition of ghosts vanish∣ing at crowing of the cock is very ancient as we learn from the Life of Apollonius Tyanaeus by Philostratus Book IV ch where the ap∣parition of Achilles is said to vanish in lightning 'for new the crowing of cocks was heard'  P  A little more than kin and less than kind  This answer of Hamlet to the king's expression  My cousin Hamlet and my son  puzzles all the commentators who seem none of them to have known that Shakspere was a bit of a punster 'Son and cousin' would Hamlet say is more than kin and yet am  less than kind  i e have no kindness for him to whom I stand in these connections Some explain it  more than kin  nearer than common kindred  and less than kind  less than friends or  no friend  as  kyth  or  kind  signifies in old English and in Scotish  Kyth and kin  in the latter language I observe to imply  friends and relations  A gentleman of Scotland when we were conversing upon this passage gave me the following instance of the meaning of kyth and kin When Oliver was Protector the judges of the court of session appointed by him formed such wise regulations and decrees in that court that not one of them could be re∣scinded tho their successors in Charles's reign wished to shew them all possible contempt Sir  ew Dalrymple of North Berwick Presi∣dent of Session in Queen Ann's time upon this being remarked in convertation said angrily  It is no wonder these folks had neither kyth nor kin  Implying that the justice of their judg∣ments was neither biassed by the influence of personal friends nor of relations The highest praise tho meant as a satire on their want of connections and of birth  P 'To dieTo sleepNo more' I do not approve of the point of interrogation The meaning requires rather a point of strong assertion if there was such a one in typography  To die is no more than to sleep they are synonymous terms and the one implies  no more  than the other  P 'Country matters' The commen∣tator is so chaste that he seems not to know that both of these words are dissyllables Tho I should be sorry to claim the praise of Agnolo Poliziano of finding obscenities where the mean∣ing was possibly innocent yet such  matters  should either not be understood or understood aright  THE word  unhouseld  in this play may be illustrated from this passage of  Chaloner's Trans∣lation of The Praise of Folie London  fig  T  pag versa  Likewise in  howsell  and receiving of the sacrament  c  OTHELLO p Warburton's note is in his usual style the arrogance of madness mingled with the ignorance of folly  I SHALL conclude with a few remarks which escaped me in their proper places  Joan keles the pot  in a song in one of Shak∣spere's plays  keles  is still used in Yorkshire for  cools to kele the pot  is to lift up the soup with the laddle and let it fall in order to cool it  Heres  in the Merry Wives of Windsor The word occurs by some singular chance in Fables de la Fontaine  Cancres  heres  et pauvres diables  Liv I Fab  where it implies  rogues  And again in his Tales  Un villageois un  haire  un miserable  Le Faucon  Sir  Hugh in the same play Knighthood was originally an ecclesiastic order  Sir  to a  priest  is more ancient than  Sir  to a  knight  See StPalaye  I FORGET where this fine passage is  The poet the lunatic and the lover  Are of imagination all compact c  Compact  in it means composed as tho he had said  all composed of consisting of imagina∣tion  as he elsewhere says 'composed of pity'  Gravitie proceedeth of wisdome and consist∣eth not in countenannce but is  compacte  of two vertues constance and prudence  Elyote's Image of Governaunce anuo    fol    TEMPEST No commentator can get any notice of Prospero duke of Milan I find in my tablets this passage of Chiabrera in his Canzoni  Come dell'or l'etate  Prospero addussi a Milanesi  Now I have not the book at hand and it escapes me whether  Prospero  is a name and noun to  addussi  or an adjective to  l'etate  by a typographic error for  prospera  for  l'etate  is feminine I find no mention of Prospero in Corio's very prolix History of Milan so falsely commended by Du Bos for it is as dull a work as ever I read  Marmoset  in The Tempest The word occurs in  The Praise of Folie  fig  J  speaking of selflove in men  as when one fowler than any  marmoset  thinks by mselfe to be goodlier than Abiolon  'Aroynt thee witch'  Macheth  The word aroynt is the same with the Scotish  tranoynt depart  In the  Life of Sir William Wallace  by Blind Harry a very curious monument of an∣cient Scotish poetry are these examples  Wallace tranoyntit upon the secund day  B  The army  Tranoyntit north upon are gudely wyse  Ib  THE old Scotish poetry which differs little from the old English both being equally allied to the Saxon would I believe if duly examined furnish many illustrations of Shakspere  LET us not dismiss the book without düe thanks to Mr Steevens to whom the readers of Shakspere are as much obliged as those of Hudibras to Dr Grey Both of them are com∣pletely versed in  All such reading as was never read  Both are fellow labourers in the congenial mines of dulness where no man of taste or science ever dirtied himself Both have ex∣plained their author without being capable of understanding him  LETTER XXXIX  LUXURY and Literature I confess com∣monly go hand in hand In proportion as the mind becomes refined the manners become so likewise The contrary is also true for in proportion as the manners become luxurious the mind grows refined as liquors after fermentation run off pure This was known to Marivaux a great master in the science of mental luxury he tells us I think in his Marianne  que l'esprit s'epure a proportion qu'il se gate  LUXURY my friend is an invidious name but is in itself the perfection of human nature I mean not however the luxury of a beast but that of a man Temperance is the highest luxury under heaven in every sense of the word If luxury consists in the free use of the most exquisite pleasures temperance is luxury luxury in the extreme luxury without satiety But this luxury is only known to the wise and  the good The learned are not always wise and good The luxury of a learned age is very frequently that luxury which confounds every sense by saturating all luxury in the penal acceptation of the word  THIS luxury is merely comparative The luxury of ancient times is barbaric penury to the present I speak of the ancient times of our own country Britain will probably never ar∣rive at the luxury of ancient Greece or Rome  THE common idea that luxury is a sure mark of a declining state is puerile and wor∣thy to be embraced by those only who as Lord Bacon somewhere says are not learned beyond certain common places Luxury is commonly a token of the progress and vital health of a state in so much that when luxury declines the state declines as the decline of spirits in the human body accompanies the de∣cline of health Few states ever atchieved any thing great till they were luxurious  WHAT a paradox you will say Was an∣cient Greece luxurious when the fields of Marathon were dyed with the blood of the Persians  YES it was Ancient Greece was luxurious in the extreme when the fields of Marathon were dyed with the blood of the Persians Read Athenaeus and you will learn that at that period the very mob of Athens walked the streets in robes of silk and with grasshoppers of gold glittering in their hair Their generals and officers were abandoned to a sensuality that disgraces the name of man and wallowed in all the beastliness of vulgar luxury and riot  THE learned men of Greece those perpetual wonders of the world as they transcended hu∣manity in some things fell below it in others Pindar Eschylus Euripides Sophocles and others we know for certainty were given up entirely to a vice too black to mention Socra∣tes himself had different catamites beside Alci∣biades tho his passion for the last was the most notorious They who look upon their infamous loves as Platonic only shew their total ignorance of Grecian learning and of Grecian manners Athenaeus whose curious work every man should read with diligent at∣tention who wishes to form a personal ac∣quaintance if I may so speak with the illus∣trious  men of Greece is a sure voucher of these facts for he gives the words of cotemporary witnesses his work being indeed only a com∣pilation Grecian manners as shewn in the writings of their authors did not regard this vice as of the slightest moment Sophocles and Euripides practised it we know in the open fields around Athens as we learn from their own epigrams preserved by Athenaeus Ana∣creon's odes shew that the passion was looked upon as equally innocent with legitimate love Tho perhaps you may reject this last testi∣mony for of late some wiseacres have disco∣vered that Anacreon's odes are not genuine because forsooth they are in a different style from the fragments of some cotemporary of his I forget whom If you have not heard of this  discovery  I know you will laugh but it is se∣rious Oh Oh Well said Dan Chaucer  The gretest clerkes bene not the wisest men  What should we say to him who told us that Waller could not be cotemporary with Milton because their style is quite dissimilar so dissi∣milar that ten centuries must have elapsed be∣tween them Did you ever hear of one Pere  Hardouin a madman of learning a common character who tells us that Homer Virgil and Horace were forged by monks in the twelsth century This discovery he made from their style In fact no ancient can be known from his style for he is a poor writer who cannot command a hundred different styles  TO return Such was Greece in the day of her glory Need I produce other instances to evince that luxury in its vulgar acceptation is the parent of great atchievments  THE reason may haply be this contempt of life must produce any of these actions in which life is evidently set down by its possessor as a mere trifle Now this contempt is more certainly produced by luxury than by the fero∣cious spirit of barbarism How you will say doth not luxury enervate a man and make him a coward The very contrary it makes him brave  TO explain this paradox only consider what a  taedium vitae  an  ennui  luxury breeds and you will not wonder that no man despises life so much as the disciple of luxury who hath  drunk of life till he is sick Men of temperance alone enjoy life and feel its delight men of luxury are the most likely to be those  Who smile on death and glory in the grave  PERSONAL courage indeed depends totally upon the animal spirits As the spirits are in perpetual fluctuation we need not wonder at a brave man on one occasion being a coward on another Yet luxurious living which ferments and exalts the spirits is certainly more likely to produce courage than the parsimony of tem∣perance Falstaff you know tells us that warm blood begets warm thoughts  THESE warm thoughts my dear friend will sometimes do wonders in literature as well as in war and there are poets whose pages have much of the true flavour of Burgundy But corporeal luxury may beget works that flash for a moment temperance the mother of mental luxury is the supreme parent of great and wise productions  I HAVE said that Britain can never rival the luxury of ancient Greece or Rome The cli∣mate forbids it A country where the means of luxury are natives of the soil will certainly be more luxurious when a just and equal go∣vernment permits the enjoyment of her own blessings than a country in which these means are the produce of commerce  IT follows not however that Britain must yield to Greece in science tho science is never widely diffused till luxury is so likewise tho luxury is never carried to a height till science refines it The reason is evident Science re∣lates to the mind but luxury to the body The mind acquires ideas of every luxury of every climate tho its grosser companion can∣not enjoy them  IT is indeed absurd to lay down general rules upon any subject Luxury may attain its height after the decline of a state as well as during its greatest elevation Perhaps we are now more luxurious than during the AGE OF GEORGE THE SECOND the period of the widest extension and fame of our empire  THO literature hath in the most celebrated countries attended with equal steps the pro∣gress of luxury yet there are climates in which they have not appeared together Na∣ture loves to vary all her operations the little folly of man only would confine her His modes of acting are few Those of nature in∣sinite He delights in systems Nature knows no systems  LETTER XL  LORD BACON in his admirable work On the Advancement of Learning pub∣lished hath with his usual amplitude of mind pointed out in what parts human science was at that time deficient From his hints many deficiencies have been supplied since that period by writers of the first merit others still remain in the state they were in that age It will I flatter myself be an enquiry of infinite curiosity and importance to shew wherein knowlege partly from that great man's ideas partly from chance and the natural advance∣ment of the arts hath been enriched since the publication of Lord Bacon's treatise and wherein it may still be pronounced to be defi∣cient and in order to this It will be first necessary to review Lord Bacon's plan  HE divides learning into three parts corre∣spondent to the three grand attributes of the mind History to the memory Poesy to the imagination and Philosophy to the judgment  HISTORY he divides into Natural Civil Ecclesiastical and Literary The three first he allows as extant the last as deficient  HE however afterwards subdivides NATURAL History into three sorts that of Nature in course that of Nature erring or varying and that of Nature altered or wrought that is says he History of Creatures History of Mar∣vails and History of Arts The first he notes as extant in perfection the two latter are so weakly treated that he remarks them as defi∣cient  CIVIL History he divides into Memoirs perfect Histories and Antiquities which last he denominates remnants of history that have escaped the shipwreck of time In the first and last he can report no deficience as being imper∣fect in their very nature  THE second species or perfect History he subdivides into History of a Time or  Chronicle  of a Person or  Lise  what we now call Biogra∣phy and of an Action or  Relation  All of these classes he allows deficient in his own country  ECCLESIASTICAL History which is indeed that of human madness need not be insisted on  HE then enumerates what he calls  appendices  to History these are Apothemes Orations and Letters His remark on the last I must beg leave to quote  Such Letters as are written for wise men are of all the words of men in my judgment the best for they are more natural than orations and public speeches and more advised than conferences or present speeches  In these he hath no deficiencies to propound  IN Poetry he can report no defect it having no progress  PHILOSOPHY he divides into Divine Natural and Human Leaving the frist to supernatural heads we shall proceed to the second which he says consists in Natural Science and Natural Prudence Natural Science he subdivides into Physic and Metaphysic the first the knowlege of matter of all that has only being and me∣tion the last that of spirit mind abstract idea In Physic he can find no defect for many au∣thers had written on it tho with what truth he pretends not to determine  METAPHYSIC relates to forms and qualities as colours vegetation gravity levity tenuity density hear cold c and secondly to final causes as if the leaves of trees are meant to protect the fruit c The first he brands as deficient the latter he allows extant but wishes it confined to its prober place  HE adds to Natural Science that of Mathe∣matics in which he observes no deficience  NATURAL Prudence or the practical part of Natural Philosophy he divides into Experimen∣tal Philosophic or that arising from a know∣lege of Physical causes and Magical which he seems so to denominate as from prosound dis∣covery being capable of operations thought supernatural as the prolongation of life beyond the natural term c This he reports as de∣fective  IN treating of Natural Prudence he recom∣mends An Inventory of the Estate of Man con∣taining all the inventions extant from which will follow a just idea of what is not yet in∣vented  HE adds to Natural Philosophy a division of Doubts or Problems general and particular the first consisting of opinions of philosophers not yet fully established or refuted the last of problems like those of Aristotle after from experiments c only doubt and not clear truth could arise In this he recommends a Calendar of Popular Errors  WE are now happily arrived at what he improperly calls HUMAN Knowlege by which he means the KNOWLEGE OF OURSELVES a part of science of the highest use and dignity and to which all the rest are but trifles This he divides into two grand heads the Knowlege of Man segregate or considered as an individual and Civil knowlege or the science of society and government  THE desiciencies noted in the first are Medi∣cinal History or Narrations of Cases omissions in Anatomy rash pronounciations by Physicians upon diseases impropriety of receipts c all mere trifles in comparison of what might be expected from such an Author  KNOWLEGE of the Mind he divides into two parts that of the Nature and that of the Facul∣ties of the soul The first he confesses beyond the sphere of human science Divination and Fascination he adds to this as small appendices foolishly enough for there are without doubt no such things in being They should have fallen under the head of Poetry  THE knowlege of the Faculties of the Mind he likewise subdivides into two kinds that of the Understanding and that of the Passions or Rational and Moral  THE first contains the Four intellectual arts that of enquiry or invention that of exami∣nation or judgment that of custody or me∣mory and that of elocution or tradition In∣vention relates to arts and to speech and argu∣ments or rhetoric and logic over which the province of Judgment likewise extends He considers Memory then passes to Tradition which is either by speech or writing to it therefore belong Grammar and Rhetoric he here treats of the methods of communicating knowlege and recommends the Socratic plan  of leaving every thing in doubt this he calls  methodus sincerus sive ad filios scientiarum  After some hints on Rhetoric he passes to two appen∣dices to the Tradition of science one of which he calls Critical and the other Pedantic know∣lege The first he divides into five points  Editing and correcting books  Annota∣tions explaining them  Knowlege of the times in which the books were written  Judgment on Authors pointing out what books deserve reading what not  The dis∣position of studies or in what order books ought to be read  PEDANTIC knowlege or that of a school∣master admits four divisions  Timing of knowlege  Progress from easy authors to difficult  Knowlege of the difference of talents  Exercise under which head he includes manners and education in general  MORAL PHILOSOPHY he considers at sore length and with his usual strength and accu∣racy except in some compliments to James I to whom his work is addressed and who was the most foolish and base prince who ever dis∣graced a throne  SOCIAL SCIENCE he next considers with great wisdom under the heads of Conversation and of Business His thoughts on this most important head are happily given in no very contracted bounds and are almost worth the whole large work of Charron I look upon this as by far the most valuable part of his most valuable performance  THE other head of CIVIL KNOWLEGE or that of Government and Laws he treats with timid brevity and it is no wonder when writ∣ing to a king and to an ideot king  DIVINE Learning or Divinity is the final part of his work and on this he writes mere nonsense like Milton and other great men whose prejudices were too strong for all their talents or who thought  loquendum ut vulgus sentiendum ut sapientes  SUCH is the Analysis and very soul of this great work Let us now proceed to what was proposed in the beginning of this Letter and endeavour to point out in what parts science hath been improved since its publication and  in what parts it is yet deficient an undertak∣ing which if executed in its due extent would be worthy of some Bacon of this age if such there can arise and were of the very first im∣portance to mankind of any literary labours whatever This is meant as an apology for the slight attempt to be made in this Letter which it is hoped you will receive with your usual indulgence of friendship for even super∣ficial hints on such a subject are of no small daring Yet literary courage and spirit of dis∣covery you have not seldom imputed to your friend Rinaldo indeed you told him lately was his model when you quoted  E volge intorno gli occhi e quella strada  Sol gli piace tentar ch'altri dispera  Let him plead in excuse these equal lines in the very next stanza  Ogni rischio al valor sempre è securo  Tutte le vie son piane a gli animosi  Courage If he fails write on his epistolary essay  Magnis tamen excidit ausis  WITHOUT further presace the first subdivi∣sion of Natural History tho considered as extant by Lord Bacon he means in Pliny Gesner and  Aldrovandus hath received such vast improve∣ments since his time by the labours of Buf∣fon and other eminent Naturalists that it evi∣dently appears that he had been rash in mark∣ing it as not deficient Botany in particular hath acquired a new and scientific form by the universal adoption of the Linnaean or sexual system  THE second subdivision on History of Won∣ders in nature is yet wanting tho in the Phi∣losophic Transactions and elsewhere are funds properly evidenced for at least a first volume of such a work than which nothing could well be more interesting even to the idle and the ignorant  IN the history of Arts France hath done so much as almost to move me to assume Lord Bacon's authority and put it down as no longer defective The history of most arts may now be found either in the Encyclopedie or pub∣lished separately by men of skill  IN Civil History the article of Memoirs was defective in England in Lord Bacon's time  France indeed had Joinville Froissart Com∣mines Italy Guicciardini There are no an∣cient Memoirs of classic times save those of Xenophon and Caesar But the article was deficient and is still in this country The Scotish authors in this way are pretty nume∣rous Melville hath vast merit in every view Burnet's Memoirs or as he calls them History of his Own Time may be pronounced the very best work on our history yet extant His ta∣lents and honesty are so great that I agree with Henry Fielding that he is the chief of our his∣torical writers tho he be sometimes too credu∣lous as for instance in relating the death of James the Second's son whom he thought supposititious The laughers who are wits to fools and fools to men of wit were against him Pope and Bolingbroke and the whole of that detestable Jacobite set united their strongest efforts to depress the work with too much success and some pitiful curs of our own time have joined in the cry But if Bur∣net's Memoirs are not very soon universally read and admired this country will speedily become a province of France Dr Johnson hath justly praised his fine style that of his  History is excellent and hath all the strength and clearness of Hume without his barbarisms You will observe that I do not look upon the work of Thuanus as Memoirs but as universal history it is not in the style of Memoirs as Burnet's History is Chronological abridg∣ments of History are highly valuable but must be written with quite different talents from those of Henault whose work is without taste and without knowlege It has sold however because he was a President  ANTIQUITIES in Lord Bacon's acceptation relate as he expresses it solely to fragments that have escaped the shipwreck of time Such are the parts of Diodorus Siculus and of Polybius that have reached us Antiquities in our modern phraseology imply all that is properly the pro∣vince of an Antiquary the science of ancient customs manners buildings dresses coins c c c This science when applied to man and manners is very amusing and entertaining and as it has escaped Lord Bacon allow me to put it down as an appendix to civil history and only desicient in Lord Bacon's sense when speaking of what he calls Antiquities that is as imper∣fect in its very nature and always admitting of further discovery  THE science of Medals forms another appen∣dix to civil History and that of the first impor∣tance as they afford the strongest collateral evidence of its truth that can be given It is surprizing this elegant study is not more gene∣ral for it certainly stands very high in the class of scientific amusements Nay the philosopher who writes or peruses history for that greatest of purposes the knowlege of human manners will learn more from medals than from the best histories  ANOTHER appendix to civil history let me mark in Parochial and County History and that of particular towns and villages which like the former will always be defective Many ingenious men have however laboured very much in it of late  TRAVELS ought to have been noted as a small appendix to Memoirs being indeed Me∣moirs of a person's life for the time he was upon his journey The credulity and igno∣rance of ancient travellers are now fallen into deserved contempt and men travel who carry philosophy and taste and knowlege of hurnan  nature along with them Many excellent books of voyages and travels now grace the English tongue in particular The travels of Brydone are even full of sublime description and would have been the first book of the kind had not the Publisher forced him to make two volumes of what he had written in one Hence his letter on comets is as con∣temptible as his letter on Etna is admirable  LORD BACON well marks Perfect History as deficient in his own country in all its branches of what we call General history Biography and History of a particular event He regrets in particular the want of a History of England and another of Scotland The first is yet wanting for all histories yet written will mis∣lead and not instruct any friend to the liberties of his country the Rhapsody of Mrs Macaulay being no exception The latter is not much better for Robertson is only a biographer on a larger scale  BRITISH Biography is a province susceptible of much improvement tho we have the Bio∣graphia Britannica a work unhappily confined by its size to great libraries  WE have no Event related on the plan of Salust tho the French have in the History of the Spanish Conspiracy at Venice by the Abbé de St Real  MR GIBBON hath perhaps given birth to a new kind of History comprehending all Lord Bacon's divisions of perfect history for The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is the relation of a vast Event extend∣ing to the form of a Chronicle and compriz∣ing Biography as the life of a Roman empe∣ror is in fact the History of the Roman world during his reign His two first volumes are well written tho not without small faults such as his seeming utterly to forget that there was such a writer as Plutarch and such a prince as Titus in the world and the chapters on Christianity which not to say they are foreign to his work are vastly too long His four last volumes I speak of the octavo edition betray a jaded attention He is evidently fa∣tigued with his subject and of consequence imagines the reader must be so to relieve him he gravely tells stories of miracles c think∣ing to amuse but nonsense doth not amuse  The style is rather incorrect likewise in these four volumes which are evidently written for sale as the first two are for fame it is even sometimes puerile as where he speaks of an emperor being distinguished no less by the  pre∣eminence  of his rank than by the  preeminence  of his fear of a barbaric invasion In the next page however is to be found the most sublime metaphor I have observed in any historian His Conclusion is pitiably unfortunate and more worthy of an old woman who had been frighted into hysterics by reading a sixpenny history of the sack of Rome by Alaric than of a man of science He seems even to forget that America teems with more barbarians his bug∣bears than all the rest of the world put toge∣ther Let him revise his History and it will stand among the very first in the world Above all things let him be less a Geographer and more a Chronologer Geography and Chronology have well been called the two eyes of History but he has extinguished the latter as hoping the other would shine more brightly  SUCH are the faults that have occurred to me in that grand work which when com∣pleted in its utmost extent will with all its blemishes be a noble accession to the treasures of English literature Nothing but my high regard for the work and its author could have induced me to so particular a discussion for none but works of the first order deserve to have their errors pointed out for those of others will not mislead  A MOST important accession hath lately been made to the province of History by the philo∣sophic spirit that is daily spreadiug to every corner of the world and every branch of sci∣ence This hath induced latter historians to blend the interesting history of society and manners with the dry detail of true facts and imaginary causes This is an improvement which even the prophetic genius of Bacon could not forsee and shews that Time is the greatest of philosophers  A BOOK of Apothemes and even an excel∣lent collection of jests and strokes of wit are yet wanting in our language tho the latter  would if executed by a man of taste and selec∣tion be as amusing as the former would be instructive Plutarch hath collected the apo∣themes of the ancients Caesar had collected a book of jests as Poggius hath done since in Latin Dominichi in Italian and Melchior de Santa Cruz in Spanish The amusements of Julius Caesar cannot be unworthy of a man of the first fame and talents and it lies with the collector and not with the subject that our jestbooks are confined to the stall  IN the Epistolary Style we have Howel a writer of wonderful merit and by no means so much esteemed as he ought to be and Mr Melmoth who in his Letters of Sir Thomas FitzOsborne hath merit and hath met with proportionable esteem in spite of his Greek names which make the work look like a ro∣mance of Queen Elizabeth's time I need not speak of Lady M W Montague whose Let∣ters are in my opinion much superior to those of the Marchioness de Sevigné tho both have the very first claim to public praise that any woman's work can have that of not being written for public praise The letters of our  professed authors published with their other works I need not mention but shall barely observe that those of Mr Gray leave the others far behind  OF Poetry I shall say nothing but that we still want in England a Comic Epic Poem in the style of the  Morgante  and the  Ricciardetto  THE improvements and advances both of what Lord Bacon calls the Physical and Meta∣physical parts of Natural Philosophy have since his time been amazing and mostly in conse∣quence of the hints of this profound writer Mr Walpole in his admirable Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors calls Bacon the prophet of arts which Newton was afterwards sent to reveal Yet Bacon was not merely a  vox clamantis in deserto  as a wag said a preacher to empty benches was but actually made many experiments to ascertain his own philo∣sophy to one of which he fell a martyr The system of Des Cartes hath risen and sallen since Bacon that of Newton hath risen and keeps its ground Galileo hath improved As∣tronomy and others have almost perfected it  till a new planet concomitant of the earth hath been within these very few years disco∣vered Why should I speak of the thermome∣ter the barometer and a thousand such inven∣tions or of electricity and electric fire a new power and new element if I may so call it tho it is in fact the element of fire before only known materially Why should I mention all the minute inventions arising from experimen∣tal philosophy of which Lord Bacon is the father and to be found in the Philosophic Transactions and Memoirs of innumerable fo∣reign academies This you know is a letter not a treatise I shall content myself with observing that Natural Science and Natural Prudence tho separated by Lord Bacon have been since wedded and have produced a great number of very fine and healthy children  THE Inventory of the Estate of Man than which nothing could well be more curious and interesting is yet wanting to the world tho its plan doth not seem of extremely difficult execution  BROWN hath happily executed a Calendar or Catalogue of Vulgar Errors tho in a most pedantic style of Latin English and which hath to the great credit of our taste been re∣vived in England after being dead a whole century  UNDER the article of Mathematics it might have been noted that the invention of Logar∣rithms about Five years after the publication of Lord Bacon's book hath greatly facilitated the solution of questions in this science Navi∣gation Geometry c have likewise received many improvements both minute and impor∣tant tho it would extend this Letter to too great a length to enumerate these improve∣ments I hasten therefore to the most impor∣tant part of Lord Bacon's work and of human science which is  THE KNOWLEGE THAT IMMEDIATELY RELATES TO MAN HIMSELF CONSIDERED AS AN INDIVIDUAL AND AS A MEMBER OF SOCIETY  LET me make one prefatory observation on this greatest branch of human knowlege  which is that it hath ever moved my highest wonder that while Sir Isaac Newton and other men of the largest genius and most severe fa∣culties have pointed the whole ardor of their minds to theories of worlds of gravitation colours and other baubles of no more conse∣quence to man than a collection of butterflies this almost the only part of science that is of importance to human kind should remain desert and uncultivated Surely nothing can be a more humiliating instance of human folly than that men and men of talents should neglect the only province of wisdom that im∣mediately interests mankind and should seem to prefer a parcel of idle and airy speculations to the grandest part of human knowlege that which tends to make man wiser better and happier to improve society and government and institute a paradise upon earth  TO descend to the smaller divisions of this ONLY TRUE KNOWLEGE some of which how∣ever are trifling in respect of others  THE deficiencies of Medicine need not be noted as it is all one defect  LOCKE'S Treatise upon Human Understand∣ing is a most acute work but tends not to increase the practical wisdom of man The nature progress and exertion of ideas are merely speculations and have a great chance of falsity for we confessedly know nothing of the nature of the mind which is their produc∣tor It is the proper application of ideas that man needs to be instructed in What is it to me from what rarifications of earth the gold of this guinea is formed The point is how am I to use it with propriety so as to benefit myself and others  THE whole divisions of Rational Knowlege are still deficient and will be till some men of vast talents apply to them and not with a speculative but with a practical bent of mind  THE appendices of Rational Knowlege be∣ing Critical and Pedantic science have received great improvements especially in England since the publication of the work On the Ad∣vancement of Learning yet deficiencies may still be noted A general collection of critical observations would be of much utility where  a system were ridiculous Elements of Criti∣cism form a good title but a woeful book full of false Elements and false Criticism Blair's Lectures on the Belles Lettres are no better he being the mere ape of the French critics and never venturing beyond his leading∣strings It is indeed the great fault of our critics that they so seldom think for themselves The two Wartons are almost the only critics we have who have shewn a genuine taste  PEDANTIC knowlege hath however made slower advances than criticism tho it is of in∣finitely more consequence When will man acquire wisdom enough to leave the pursuit of big trifles for that of small things that most import him  THE system of education is still foolish Rousseau hath pointed out some improvements but a defect almost inseparable from great views is that they are always wasted in specu∣lation Hence few of his remarks can be of any practical use  ONE of the most glaring defects in the pre∣sent state of Pedantic Science is the great time wasted in acquiring dead languages which in nine cases out of ten are of no use to the child but in fact are quite neglected and forgotten by him in a few months after he hath left school Perfection of folly To waste the most precious years of human life in acquiring useless lan∣guages and languages that are to be forgotten O  caecas hominum mentes  Where a boy is in∣tended for any of the learned professions or is heir of an easy fortune the study of languages is proper but in this order one year for the English one year for the Greek one year for three other tongues the Latin Italian and French but while studying these languages they should be considered as amusements and relaxations as learning the French is now while the ART OF BEING A MAN should be considered as the business of a boy's education Domestic and Social Wisdom Virtue and Hanpiness all the honest arts of making life delightful respectable and important to so∣ciety these ought to form the essence and great object of education It is a trite observa∣tion that girls arrive sooner at womanly man∣ners  and knowlege than boys do at the man∣ners and knowlege proper for their sex This is ascribed to Nature having assigned a previous maturity to females The fact is it is the con∣sequence of the different modes of education A girl is doing the honours of the table and winning every body by her polished conversa∣tion while a boy is blubbering over an useless book His being a man all his life is of no consequence provided he is a scholar for a few yearsPrejudice Prejudice When will the happy period arrive that humankind shall break thy detestable shackles only strong from the weakness of the wearers When will the awful voice of Nature sound to the human mind Be free  IN Moral Philosophy and Social Science these greatest divisions of this grand part of knowlege few or no advances have been made The lesser morals have perhaps been improved by the Spectator and other works of the kind being universally read and the importance even of the least points of morality is so great that I believe every man of a sound and bene∣volent mind will agree that there is more real  glory in having written two pages that have actually taught mankind how to be virtuous and happy than in composing whole systems of speculation more illustrious fame arising from one of Mr Addison's papers in the Spec∣tator than from the whole works of Sir Isaac Newton even tho he had demonstrated an acute and stupendous theory of deity itself  CIVIL Knowlege or that of Government and Laws hath certainly admitted no small improvements since Lord Bacon's age Not only books of merit have been written upon these points but what is of far higher mo∣ment the practical operation of Government and Laws hath in most kingdoms been ren∣dered more beneficial It is amazing indeed to consider how widely philosophy hath spread the light of liberty and happiness over great part of the world within a short period of time The reduction of the papal power in many of the kingdoms where it was most predominant is in particular a grand epoch of the triumph of science over folly and fanaticism What may we not hope when such is the beginning of the reign of Philosophy A perpetual peace among  all the powers of Europe in which every use∣ful and elegant art shall be carried to a perfec∣tion unknown even to the dreams of visionaries might almost no longer be regarded as an idle imagination  WITH regard to theoretical knowlege of Laws and Government the work of Montes∣quieu deserves mention tho its brief and appa∣rently deep and dictatorial style hath acquired it infinitely more fame than it deserves The treatises of Millar and Ferguson on Civil So∣ciety have merit tho by no means of the first kind the last author in particular being the dryest whom I ever remember to have read insomuch that the most interesting subjects lose all interest in his frigid pages  CAN I pass the subject of Government and Laws without expressing an ardent with for a reform of those of our yet happy country for tho her sun be set as statesmen tell us yet it is a very fine evening and promises a future bright day That a CODE OF ENGLISH LAW should never yet be thought of by the legisla∣ture is one of the strangest instances of the  melancholy truth that human affairs are go∣verned by Chance and not by Wisdom But God forbid that it should be attempted during this tory reign in which we behold judges carrying politics into the bench of impartial justice as violently as in the reign of James II in spite of the infamy of Jeffries which awaits them In∣deed it may safely be said that the laws of this country are either a disgrace to the constitution or the constitution to the laws for it is a cer∣tain fact however paradoxical it may seem that they are often in direct opposition to each other To instance in one point it is a maxim in the law as tories tell us that the king can do no wrong By the constitution of this country according to two precedents the king can not only do wrong but be put to death as Charles I or banished as James II according to the of∣fence But I forget that I am talking of our liberties after they are ACTUALLY LOST from this very cause of the laws being destructive of the constitution for cases of libel or of trea∣son are the most delicate and chief objects be∣tween prince and subject and thanks to our Jacobite judges  an information  is lodged ex  offi∣cio  by the Attorney General a  Special Jury  is  packed by the judge and must obey his com∣mands if they fail in any point they are browbeaten and taught to know better and thus every subject who steps forth to defend the rights of his brethren is the slave of the slave of the king Thus it is in the power of any prince who shall even want common fa∣culties to overturn our constitution and enslave us by our own laws Montesquieu hath ob∣served that no state can be free in which the laws of treason are not most accurately defined in every point because upon them the very ex∣istence of liberty depends Now in our  happy and glorious  constitution the laws of treason are quite inaccurate Indeed whoever will examine our constitution and laws together will pro∣nounce both to be very imperfect and if we are not slaves the cause is in our breasts and hands not in our constitution nor our laws Before our constitution can be called perfect the king must by law resign one half of his present power and patronage which he may do without the slightest danger of an Aristo∣cracy rising on his ruins That this was not done on the accession of William III or of George I to the throne is an eternal disgrace  to the judgment of our National Councils In the later event especially if the very title of King was given nothing was too great to ask or rather to keep  SUPPOSING the laws rendered perfect who can afford to pay for them Sweet laws that cannot be administered without ruining the opprest It is to he hoped that in the course of a  century  or  two  we shall have wisdom enough to reduce the fees of courts and lawyers to one tenth of what they are now And when re∣formation once begins it precipitates so that whenever that event takes place we may ven∣ture to prophesy that in the course of a year thereafter these fees will be reduced to one∣thirtieth part of the present which would yet be too high  LET me add that  Police  in particular a word unknown to the English language and to the English laws is woefully deficient in this enormous metropolis Why is not the price of meat for instance regulated as that of bread Our wise senators are so much occupted with gamelaws that they cannot bestow the  most trifling attention on the lives and proper∣ties of their constituents when God knows it matters not the tossing up of a straw if there were not a bird of game in the three kingdoms or beast of game except the hunters The Criminal Laws of Britain are much too mur∣derous and seem utterly to forget that there are punishments more dreadful than death even to the meanest mind  SUCH are my hasty thoughts on this grand subject of the Progress of Knowlege Sensible of their defects I even submit them with anxiety to the judgment of your affectionate friendship  P S YOU will perhaps think a former assertion of this Letter extravagant namely that the study of Burnet's History is connected with the welfare of our state But it only means that the true and old Whig principles are essential to that welfare and that if these prevail Burnet will be read with admiration As for the new Whig principles they have done as much harm to the constitution as toryism An old whig wishes a reduction of prerogative a new whig wishes to extend it if it will serve his faction  LETTER XLI  YOU rightly observe that the fewness of original writers is greatly owing to the unjust esteem in which Imitation is held Imi∣tation is in fact only a decent and allowed pla∣giarism When it appears in a certain degree it is pronounced literary theft and justly held infamous in other degrees and in certain forms and dresses it is called honourable but in fact it only differs in the degree of disirepute  IMITATION I define such evident copying from a former author in whatever language as evinces that the imitator meaned to appro∣priate the merit of the thoughts language or other perfections of his model to himself If such imitation can have any claim to praise it must arise from the originality of the copy if I may use an expression that sounds a little Boeo∣tian When the copy is inferior to the original neglect is certainly its proper reward if supe∣rior it merits no praise for  facile est inventis addere  it is an casy matter to improve on the inventions of others  OUR idea of Imitation must not however be extended too far else we shall pronounce every author who writes a poem in TwentyFour Books an imitator of Homer It is only imitation of general design in its distinct divi∣sions of episodes c imitation of incidents of characters of sentiments images style man∣ner that is properly Imitation For instance  MILTON writes an epic poem as Homer hath done for I call Milton's Paradise Lost an epic poem in every sense of the word critics who scruple this appellation seem to forget that  epic  only means  narrative  and may with great justice be applied to a Tale of Fontaine tho generally ascribed to narrative poems of the highest order by way of excellence I say Milton writes an epic poem as Homer hath done but wherein doth he imitate Homer In not one point The general plan of his poem his incidents c are totally different from those of Homer or any other writer Milton is therefore an original poet  VIRGIL writes an epic poem likewise as Homer hath done wherein doth he imitate  Homer In every thing He hath nothing of his own all is stolen stolen without acknow∣legement It follows that he is an infamous plagiary  YET the world hath not dared so to arraign him The enormity of his crime precluded due punishment You know what the pirate said to some great conqueror that the victor because he slaughtered whole nations and plundered whole empires was called a hero whereas he who only killed a few persons and rifled a paltry treasure was called a thief So it hath fared with Virgil  MR GIBBON somewhere expresses a surprize that no Greek writer whatever tho many are posterior to Virgil ever thought him worth mention The cause is evident The Greeks looked upon him as a paltry translator and what is worst of all an epitomizing translator of their own immortal poet Had a Greek mentioned him it must have been with utter scorn as we would mention any writer who should publish in French the Paradise Lost and the Paradise Regained frittered down into  a foppish production in six books and desire the world to look upon it as an epic poem  I HAVE said that an imitation may be origi∣nal and that in this point only the very mi∣nute merit of imitation consists Mr Pope's Imitations of Horace are original and happy Boileau's poor copies which he hath had the impudence to call Satires are constrained and feeble he has gone behind the ancients like a menial not like a king with his attendants before him  ALL kinds of imitation and all imitations whatever sink into that class of poetry which we read to ladies at a teatable and then give to the servant that he may not burn his hands in carrying off the teaurn No man of real genius can be an imitator supposing that he made the attempt originality is coessential with genius as Milton tells us that light is coeternal with the deity  YET with us there is likewise a god of theft as Lucian phrases it    and we seem to venerate Lucian in cum qui dixit Prometheus es in verbis  imitations as much as originals goods got by theft as much as those honestly acquired nay we bestow upon the thief of sublime inventions the deification only due to the first inventor  WE all know that painters of little or no merit have yet made such perfect copies of the works of the greatest masters that even in some cases these masters themselves could not distinguish them from their own productions Yet the copiers acquired no reputation from those imitations Why should it be otherewise in poetry Imitations of the very verbage and manner of Chaucer Spenser Milton we see daily performed by writers of slender talents and such imitations I will venture to pronounce the easiest of literary labours and in no respect more entitled to praise than copies of paintings  SPEAKING of imitation in painting I can∣not help adding a remark on the complete folly of instituting  Academies of Painting  or any other art or science that is  Schools of Imita∣tion  Did ever any one good painter arise from an academy Never not even one of the slightest reputation The moment the French  academy was instituted painting ceased in that country No more Claudes or Poussins arose It was reserved for the ideotic counsels of this Gothic reign to crush all hopes of the progress of painting at once by founding an academy In our academy as in others all imitate none invent the art is of course at a stand soon to fall if other means do not foster it  I KNOW of no service which our Royal Aca∣demy doth but to spoil many good taylors by converting them into  artists  as they call them∣selves It is to be hoped some future prince will just have sense enough to dissolve this lump of regal solly and to say to art and sci∣ence "Be free" We already see its effects in the odd productions of its members In the hall of the Society for the encouragement of Arts Manusactures and Commerce John Street Adelphi is now exposed to public view such a series of daubings by a Royal Academician nay Professor of Painting to the Royal Academy as would both for design and execution have dis∣graced Lapland in the Twelfth century Had they appeared on sign posts they would only have arraigned the taste of the innholders but  as the painter is so impudent as to hold them out as a  national  work the most public con∣tempt and censure is due to them What must foreigners think of us upon reading the puffs and seeing the productions Posterity Poste∣rity indeed we are not quite so barbarous as thou wilt take us to be should these  Academical Exercises  reach thy notice This artist I am in∣formed hath written "A Treatise on Painting" in which he is always quoting many classics God help us A man must bring a classic sense to the classics else their high ideas will con∣found and not enlighten  TO young writers especially Imitation can∣not be held out in too just in too contemptible a light They ought even to be told that there is more applause due to a bad original than to the best of copies By these means they will at leass endeavour to be original and this they cannot accomplish without trying to think for themselves and to dig diamonds from the mines of invention by their own labour A point of the utmost consequence to every kind of science for were the clouds which Imitation and Pre∣judice raise in the mind dispersed knowlege of  every denomination would diffuse its benignant light with redoubled rapidity  TO very young writers I allow Imitation is proper as a task but it ought only to be re∣garded as such and abandoned with other aca∣demical occupations Even this can only be permitted from the consideration that many minds are like wildings and will neither bear flowers nor fruit till they are grafted  POSTSCRIPT  SINCE my Letter On Improving the Lan∣guage it has occurred to me from the hints of some very learned and ingenious men who much approve of the other ideas that the final  th  however soft to an English ear cannot be pronounced by foreigners at all and is there∣fore by no means laudable The final  h  had better be always omitted except in interjec∣tions as Ah Oh and its the word  breath  where it is very expressive Substantives in  th  should take the  é  omitting the  h  as truté faité c in verbs c both the  t  and  h  ought  commonly to be cut off or else altered accord∣ing to the genius of the language By giving plurals in  a  and a few substitutions of  z  perhaps a sufficient number of the letter  s  will be thrown out and the  present tense  of verbs may very well retain that letter Certain it is that were we to give the  th  and the still worse  eth    begineth  c the language would only be rendered more barbarous and horrible nothing being so feeble and uncouth as that termination  eth  The  h  is extremely frequent in our tongue and ought to be omitted whenever it can Even the final  sh  had far better be altered  I FORGOT to mention that the plural in  a  is perfectly AngloSaxon and homogeneous to our language there being two declensions in  a  out of the six declensions of substantives in the AngloSaxon Grammar drawn from Hickes The instances are ƿiln  ancilla  ƿilna  ancillae  and sunu  filius  suna  filii  So that you see both male and female substantives admitted of it originally and the neuter may certainly take it with at least equal propriety  LETTER XLII  I GRANT you that Mr Gray's censure of David Hume is the most exceptionable part of his Letters but it is very vindicable being written in confidence to a friend and with no intention that the public should see it His trite application of the remark that muddy rivers seem deep shews that it was written in an un∣lucky moment when thought is absent and perhaps in the fluster of evening wine which last is indeed the only apology that can be made for the remainder of the stricture No writer can be more clear and manly than Hume I mean as to his sense nay what is wonderful his style is always easily intelligible tho full of solecisms and every species of bar∣barity his gaiety is always that of an inno∣cent and truly wise man His History of England nay his Essays display talents very far superior to any that Gray hath ever shewn Mr Hume might have ruled a state Gray's utmost views would only have ruled a college  Hume's reputation in France was only the echo of his fame in England Mr Gray shewed himself less than a child when he called Hume one Such mad calumnies recoil upon their author's judgment and crush it to nothing Yet all this censure lights upon the Editor for Gray would have called upon mountains to cover his shame if he had seen his name pub∣licly branded with throwing dirt from Billings∣gate upon a cotemporary lord of fame because his envy saw that he was richer drest and of far higher rank than himself  THE History of Mr Hume is indeed very far from being laudable It is a mere apology for prerogative from beginning to end and tho the best apology which hath been offered is yet very weak which shews the cause must be desperate when even so great an advocate utterly fails in its defence At the same time that his political principles led him to exalt the prerogative his philosophic opinions forced him to depress the church while every body knows that  no church no king  Hence his work is one chaos of heterogeneous axioms and misrepresented events His opinions even com∣bated  his natural sensibility for I remember that in narrating some of the most flagitious acts of cruelty of the blessed reign of Charles I or II he displays due sense of the atrocity of such calm deeds of tyranny as make the fren∣zies of Nero or Domitian mere jests but when he hath got thro them and his opinion begins to resume cooler operation he gravely begins his next paragraph thus  These acts of seve∣rity if they can be called such  WHAT was the reason do you think that could induce a writer of such talents to prosti∣tute them so basely that could induce such a philosopher to suppose that millions of human beings were to hold their life and happiness at the nod of  one of them  of a thing called a king perhaps in corporeal and in mental powers less than the least of his subjects  THIS is easily accounted for Hume was poor and wished to be rich The king is the surest fountain of wealth and to flatter him is the path to preferment and to opulence Hence public spirit is almost unknown in monarchies for one man centers in himself the wealth and  praise of his subjects Hume tells us himself Chap LX  Though the established government was but the mere shadow of a commonwealth yet was it beginning by proper arts to encourage that public spirit which no other species of civil polity is ever able fully to inspire  Hear him Hear him Then your History Mr Hume wishes to ex∣tinguish PUBLIC SPIRIT that is to destroy the most laudable principle of society  I KNOW not how it is that the whole late Scotish writers of any eminence have been on the tyrannic side if we except Dr Stuart a man of real abilities but strangely misapplied in pulling down those of others Yet presby∣tery the religion of that country hath always been considered as necessarily connected with whig principles and the common people of Scotland are almost universally whigs The peers are however almost all tories owing to the feudal spirit of tyranny and slavery not being wholly extinguished in that kingdom till when heretable jurisdictions were abo∣lished The court can only judge of Scotland by the nobility the fathers of whom having  been tyrants to slaves the sons are willing to be slaves to tyrants for such is the spirit of the feudal system a later emancipation from which hath thrown Scotland a whole century behind England in point of civil liberty Now the writers in general naturally adapt their principles to those of their superiors and the court  unto whom they look for their reward  HENCE in our times Junius Wilkes Churchill and other men of talents have judged of that ancient and warlike kingdom very unjustly A  Scot  is with them synonymous with a  tory  a  slave  Nothing can be more opposite to the spirit of the nation however it may apply to the noble  scum  on the  top  or the  dregs  of mer∣cenary writers at the  bottom  But the nation is full of generous liquor and hath nothing to do either with its  scum  or its  dregs  which are always worst when the liquor is best Indeed Churchill's works have passed thro more edi∣tions and are more read in Scotland than here which shews that the love of that coun∣try for liberty is superior even to the most in∣veterate national prejudices  BY a necessary chain Scotish tories and Ja∣cobites are now court favorites  They taste the sweets of this Saturnian reign  Epistle to Sir W Chambers  while the real nation and its real interests are neglected and despised It is certainly fortunate that Scotland hath not been  free  above forty years as to that circumstance we are indebted for its happy quiet at a time when every pro∣vince of the British empire evinces in commo∣tion or in rebellion the odious and most de∣plorable but natural and unavoidable effects of those tory principles of government which have prevailed thro this pitiful and miserable reign and have made it one blot in the British Annals  IT is no less wonderful than true that ever since the name of Whig hath been known the nation hath been indebted for all its glorious events to men of that description and for its miseries to the Tories Indeed my friend if any one will shew me that a tory ministry ever did the least good to this country or even did not do it great injury I shall turn tory in∣stantly but if from the reign of James I to this hour tory ministers have by every mea∣sure  brought calamity and disgrace on their country then must every Briton view such principles as the seeds of death in our constitu∣tion and on those who profess them and fos∣ter them in the chief magistrate as deserving of the execration of every good man and in fact of the highest punishment which the laws of society can ordain for those who meditate the utter perdition of the community  A KING of Great Britain who knows that by the present constitution he is only elective chief magistrate of the country and will com∣ply with his station it is a glorious one hath it in his power to appropriate to himself all the fame rising from the public spirit of the greatest of modern nations But if he wishes to extend his prerogative that is to extinguish that public spirit he is a  suicide  and the jury of posterity will bring it in  lunacy  For he is the enemy of his own power not to say of his own exist∣ence the power of an English king being directly opposite to his prerogative for his power is drawn only from the confidence of the nation which his prerogative will infal∣libly destroy if displayed and not kept as a  sword in the scabbard never to be drawn by a brave man but upon most urgent occasion If he makes himself little he will be great indeed but if he bites the curb which our fathers have put in his mouth it is of steel and he will only spoil his teeth If he wishes to be an ox he will feel himself only the frog in the fable  YOU will know that I mean still less to defend the philosophic tenets of David Hume tho he be a great and elegant writer of philo∣sophy But I detest the principles of any man who writes popularly against the religion of his country let it be what it will if it does not injure political freedom the first of human blessings I say popularly because if treated in an high and abstract or in a poetical style as Lucretius hath done it will not injure the vulgar faith but only afford speculation to the learned Religion is the only bond of society for the mob and they ought not even to sus∣pect that their superiors despise it as they will in that case from their ignorance of moral theory imagine that their superiors have no laws and consequently that they ought to have none Philosophy will never do for the vulgar  They must be bound in the chains of prejudice and so led thro the road of life and not trusted to themselves after proper information  BESIDES my friend the consolations of human life are by no means too numerous Religion is one of the chief of these consola∣tions to thousands of people and among these to many possest of qualities superior to genius knowlege or philosophy qualities that con∣stitute the GOOD the first order of society Shall I with rash and sacrilegious hand burst open the temple of their happiness and steal away the palladium of their peace Forbid it Humanity Forbid it even Philosophy The philosophy that is not benevolent is false and destructive It is impossible for man to know the truth but it is of no importance whether his felicity be founded on truth or on delusion  LETTER XLIII  I KNOW not how an opinion hath been propagated among several relaters of the life of Torquato Tasso which hath no foun∣dation in fact it is that Tasso's madness origi∣nated from his presumptuous and disappointed love for Leonora da Este sister of Duke Al∣fonso of Ferrara The fact is his madness arose from the various troubles of a dependant and perplexed life operating with unceasing violence upon a melancholy temperament and a morbid tenderness of feeling But before we trace it let us discuss this same tale of Leonora The materials for this discussion shall be drawn from the only authentic life of Tasso that written by his friend Giovanni Battista Manso lord of Bisaccio and Pianca This long and curious narrative is so extremely rare that it is no wonder latter biographers only speak of it from report The edition used is that of Venice mo pages  MANSO tells that there were three ladies of the name of Leonora at Ferrara all of whom are celebrated by his friend in different sonnets c and that it is impossible to say which of them stood highest in his affections or even if any of them was mistress of his heart These were the princess Leonora abovementioned Leonora Countess of San Vitale and Leonora one of the maids of honour to the princess Manso seems to incline to think the latter was the lady really beloved by Tasso which indeed is so probable that one may safely pronounce it the truth  THE beginning of Tasso's madness is dated by Manso about the thirtysecond year of his age two years after publishing the immortal Gerusalemme when he was tyrannically con∣fined by order of Duke Alfonso on pretence that he wished no whim of Tasso should de∣prive his court of so great a character The violent opposition to his great poem and the contempt which the invidious tried to throw upon it are put by his biographer as one great cause of his alienation of mind The increase of it he marks as owing to these causes  The  falsehood of a friend who published what was confided to him as an inviolable secret the  amori  of Tasso  The base suspicions raised against him by his enemies  His several confinements  The loss of the Duke his pa∣tron's favour  Let me add as the strongest cause of all his being so heated at the bad re∣ception of the Gerusalemme a reception in all ages given to works surpassing common expec∣tation as to rewrite that Poem under the title of La Gerusalemme Conquistata nay to com∣pose many books of a third alteration to be like a medium between the two former  Such long compositions written with heat and rancour must certainly have impaired the most exube∣rant brain and carried off the whole spirits of the mind till lees alone were left  IT may not be incurious to examine the nature of a shock that could lay so vast a soul in ruins The enquiry will resemble that of the philosopher who visits a delicious country desolated by an earthquake Calabria the na∣tive realm of Tasso now presents too lively an image of his situation in his latter days All that is grand all that is beautiful mingled in horrible confusion  THE qualities of Tasso's disease are described by Manso to have been these  MELANCHOLY This seems to have been inherited from his father There is a pleasing melancholy which is always the con∣comitant of genius and which whoever hath not felt  He need not wooe the Muse he is her scorn  But Tasso's melancholy was a torment to him  I must always be an object of your compas∣sion  says he in a letter to Mauritio Cataneo  because the melancholy which torments me is infinite and the worst I could say of it would exceed all belief and yet would not be so bad as the truth  DELIRIUM owing to hypocondriac causes which increased to  MADNESS accompanied with a belief of his being  UNDER the influence of witchcraft and  ATTENDED by an apparition  Such are Manso's divisions which cannot be called very proper On the two last he gives us some curious details which may be worth  taking brief notice of Tasso speaks thus of his enchantment and supposed spiritual attend∣ant  folletto  in a letter to Mauritio Cataneo  You must know that I was bewitched and have never been cured and perhaps have more need of an exorcist than of a physician because my disease proceeds from magical art I would likewise write a few words respect∣ing my daemon the rascal hath lately robbed me of many crown pieces I know not the amount as I am by no means a miser in reckoning my money but I dare say they amount to twenty He hath likewise turned all my books topsyturvy opened my chests robbed me of my keys which I could not keep from him I am at all times unhappy but especially in the night I know not whe∣ther my disease proceeds from frenzy or not  This was written when he was confined at St Ann's and after his deliverance from confine∣ment he still writes thus to the same Cataneo  This day the last of the year the brother of the reverend signior Licino has brought me two of your letters but one of them was taken from me as soon as I had read it and I believe the  folletto  must have carried it off  because it is that in which he is mentioned and this is one of the miracles which I have seen often in the hospital  St Ann's at Fer∣rara where the duke sent him and appointed skilful physicians to attend him  These things I am certain are done by some magi∣cian and I have many arguments of it par∣ticularly of a loaf visibly stolen from me one afternoon and a plate of fruit taken from before me the other day when a Polish gen∣tleman  gentil giovane Polacco  came to see me worthy indeed to be witness of such a wonder c  MANSO afterwards tells us that Tasso would frequently in company be quite abstracted in his frenzy would talk to himself and laugh profusely and would fix his eyes keenly upon vacancy for a long time and then say that he saw his familiar spirit and describe him as un∣der the semblance of an angelic youth such as he paints him in his dialogue of  Le Messagiero  Manso particularly mentions that once Tasso angry at his incredulity told him that he should see the spirit with his own eyes Ac∣cordingly next day when they were talking  together and sitting by the fire Tasso suddenly darted his eyes to a window in the room and sat so intent that when Manso spoke to him he returned no sort of answer At last he turned to him and said  Behold the friendly spirit who is courteously come to converse with me look at him and perceive the truth of my words  Manso immediately threw his eyes toward the spot but with his keenest vision could see nothing but the rays of the sun shining thro the window into the chamber While he was thus staring Tasso had entered into lofty discourse with the spirit as he per∣ceived from his share of the dialogue that of the spirit was not audible to him but he so∣lemnly declares that the discourse was so grand and marvellous and contained such lofty things expressed in a most unusual mode that he re∣mained in extacy and did not dare to open his mouth so much as to tell Tasso that the spirit was not visible to him In some time the spirit being gone as Manso could judge Tasso turned to him with a smile and said he hoped he was now convinced To which Manso replied that he had indeed heard wonderful things but had seen nothing Tasso said  Perhaps you have  heard and seen more than  he then paused and Manso seeing him in silent me∣ditation did not care to perplex him with fur∣ther questions  THE high things which Manso heard doubtless originated from Tasso's warm attach∣ment to the Platonic philosophy that sublime tissue of dreams and visions I would remark upon the whole subject of this letter that it is a woeful proof of the weakness of the most exalted mind when it lays the rein upon the neck of imagination A man of genius cannot take too much care to prevent his supernatural fancy from assuming any power over common life The effect of imagination upon the mind is like that of lime upon a fruittree a little buried at the root will make it healthy and flourishing but too much will totally destroy it  BEFORE I conclude it may be proper to ob∣serve that the genuine Life of Tasso by Manso was to the best of my knowledge never pub∣lished This now quoted which is generally called Manso's Life of Tasso is in fact only  transcribed from his as we may judge from the title which is  Vita di Torquato Tasso  scritta da  Gio Battista Manso c Al sereniss Sig Duca d' Urb  c The dedication is signed by the publisher Evangelisto Deuchino and I know not if he be not the author The work is however equally valuable as if it had been written by Manso the author calling him his intimate friend and being intrusted by him with Tasso's MS correspondence I suppose Manso's Life was brief it seems in this work to be transcribed with great additions  LETTER XLIV  ON different late occasions the subject of literary forgery hath been mentioned without any enquiry ever being made into its propriety or impropriety Some wise writers have pronounced it ridiculously enough to partake of the crime of penal forgery and have said that he who will publish a new pro∣duction as ancient would forge an obligation Others with great justice assert that nothing can be more innocent that the fiction of ascribing a piece to antiquity which in fact doth not belong to it can in no sort be more improper than the fiction of a poem or novel that in both the delight of the reader is the only intention  INDEED those innocents who call such forgery criminal forget that they are blaspheming their saviour and their religion for the whole para∣bles of Jesus Christ which are narrated with circumstances that most strongly imply them  to be true yet are allowed fictitious fall under this head Nor is there more falsehood in Ma∣rivaux's telling us that one of his novels was found in pulling down an old partition in Mr Walpole's account of his Castle of Otranto being a translation from an Italian romance in Macpherson's Ossian if you will than in any of the sacred fables wherein strict truth is sacrificed to the pleasure of the hearer  PERHAPS in fact nothing can be more heroic and generous in literary affairs than a writer's ascribing to antiquity his own production and thus sacrificing his own fame to give higher sa∣tisfaction to the public It certainly partakes of that nobility of soul which is content with its own suffrage and ranks the author among those who  Do good by stealth and blush to find it fame  People of shallow understandings are always the most suspicious of being made dupes and are the most clamorous when they find they are so those of deeper minds are not deceived by the fiction as to their judgment yet their fancy admits the deceit and receives  higher pleasure from it than it possibly could were no deceit used  Magnanima menzogna or quando è il vero  Si bello che si possa a te preporre  THERE are however certain kinds and even certain modes of literary forgery that may justly be held improper for that is the highest reproach that can be applied to the worst kinds of them none being in the least injurious to society Of the improper kind is forgery of histories as those of Berosus and Manetho by Annius of Viterbo or works of instruc∣tion as the book of Dominico Flocci  De Ma∣gistratibus Romanis  ascribed to Fenestella and in short of all the sorts of writing in which truth is the object Poetry and romance are sacred to fiction and it can never be pushed too far  Pictoribus atque Poetis  QUIDLIBET AUDENDI semper fuit aequa potestas  Yet with one exception as to the mode for instance had Muret when he forged the verses ascribed to Afranius so exquisitely sent them to Joseph Scaliger not in common writ∣ing  but transcribed on vellum and fumigated with art so as to appear part of an ancient manuscript I doubt of its propriety tho it would have been even in that case an impo∣sition only worthy of laughter to men of sense but to weak minds every thing is a crime  I shall close my letter with an applicable quotation from Mr Addison upon this subject to be found in No of the Spectator 'Some' observes he  say an author is guilty of falsehood when he talks to the public of manuscripts which he never saw or describes scenes of action or discourse in which he was never engaged But these gentlemen would do well to consider there is not a fable or parable which ever was made use of that is not liable to this exception since no∣thing according to this notion can be re∣lated innocently which was not once mat∣ter of fact  LETTER XLV  IT would doubtless be going too far to say that the Romans had no original writers and if you look into my former letters you will find that I made no such assertion  YET their original authors are very few and if you please this letter shall briefly re∣capitulate their eminent writers and distin∣guish those that may justly receive the high distinction of Original An order nearly chro∣nological shall be followed and they only men∣tioned whose works have reached us  PLAUTUS a poet too much neglected his works having infinitely more merit than those of Terence is however not original except perhaps in one or two plays  TERENCE need not be mentioned his plays being mere translations Had only one of those been preserved his fame would have  stood six degrees higher according to the num∣ber of his dramas the perfect similarity of which evinces that he was possest of not one speck of genius even as a translator  LUCRETIUS was not altogether original there being Greek Philosophic poems of the same kind by Empedocles and others which are lost but as we know not that he took any thing from them as his episodes in par∣ticular and his whole poem in general breathe a bold spirit of apparent originality put him down in the middle rank between Originals and Imitators  CICERO nor Caesar cannot be called ori∣ginal in any view  SALLUST is an evident imitator of Thucy∣dides and Livy of Herodotus yet they are both superior to their originals Still they are imitators  VIRGIL is the most pitiful imitator of the whole Roman writers as was shewn on a former occasion  CATULLUS appears to me not original the hendecasyllabi his favorite vehicle being Gre∣cian Two or three of his pieces are known to be translations without acknowlegement a strong proof against the rest  TIBULLUS appears to have the first claim to originality of perhaps all the Roman writers Callimachus and Philetas wrote Elegies but they were not amatory nor plaintive Athe∣naeus tells us that Callimachus wrote an Elegy on a victory and I learn from no ancient that any one of them was on the subject of love His hymns which have reached us say little for his talents The elegies of Philetas are sometimes quoted by obscure ancient writers but from these quotations we judge that their subjects were remote from those of Tibullus Upon the whole I set down this exquisite poet as original  PROPERTIUS is not because Tibullus wrote before him He is very inferior to Tibullus in every respect and is in fact a mere pedant in love I must remark on the beginning of the First Elegy of his Third Book  Callimachi manes et Coi sacra Philetae  In vestrum quaeso me sinite ire nemus  Primus ego ingredior puro de fonte sacerdos  Itala per Graios orgia ferre choros  that the reference to Callimachus and Philetas only points at the elegiac stanza used by them not at the subject and that we need not won∣der at the boast in the last couplet when we reflect that Virgil hath the impudence to say the same tho twenty Latin poets had stolen from the Greeks before he was born  I DOUBT much if Horace be original in any of his odes but they are his worst work for he is certainly a very middling lyric poet we must estimate him by his chief works his Satires and his Epistles and in them espe∣cially in the last heavens what an original what an exquisite writer In the Satires he is happy in the Epistles superlatively so Tha  to the Pisos when properly understood which we of this age are now happily enabled to do from Mr Colman's most ingenious and acut  translation and commentary is full of as much good sense and lucid order as the epistolar plan can require By the way let me add from  Mr Colman's just idea of this epistle that the magisterial rule of not making a drama shorter or longer than five acts seems to be addressed to him of the younger Pisos who had written a play and who had probably extended it beyond that number as Sophocles hath some∣times done Horace as an argument to per∣suade him to suppress his piece which is the intention of his epistle fixes it as an absolute rule tho indeed from no authority that no drama should exceed or fall short of five acts This rule would he say you have not com∣plied with therefore your piece is unfit for public view  TO return from his grand works of the Satires and Epistles put Horace as an original writer  OVID was doubtless original in his Meta∣morphoses and Fasti but his originality is futile and of no value  CELSUS hath high merit in every view and may I believe be even entitled to the praise of originality upon the whole A classic edition  of him is much wanted The late Dr Brisbane of Middlesex Hospital author of The Anatomy of Painting had made large MS collections with this view which I happened to purchase of a bookseller and if you know any man of learning who would use them with their au∣thor's intention they should be at his service  TO Phaedrus the merit of being original cannot be denied As a Fabulist he is prefer∣able to every writer not excepting Fontaine himself Terse polite facetious most ele∣gantly brief he doth honour even to the age of Augustus His language in simple beauty exceeds that of Terence and the language of Terence is his sole merit that of Phaedrus is not his merit but his dress The best fables are I III IV the th of Book IV is a disgrace to his work as well as some others  Ubi plura nitent  c Where is the human work that is perfect  JUVENAL and Persius have each an original style in their Satires their thoughts are also original It would be mere cavil then to deny their praise of originality The first is a writer  of amazing moral sublimity His Satires I suspect are superior to those of Horace if sub∣limity be a quality of writing superior to grace as for my own part I have no doubt but it is The obscurity of Persius throws him quite out of the rank of good writers  LUCAN is original but it is the originality of Ovid an originality of no price His grand and Stoic diction deserves however much praise and even considered as a poet I agree with Heinsius and Corneille that he is infinitely su∣perior to Virgil  THE Natural History of Pliny is an original of vast design and masterly execution  QUINTILIAN is the only sensible critic of antiquity the only one who knew method or distinction but he cannot be called original  STATIUS Martial Valerius Flaccus Silius Italicus have no claim to originality  TO Tacitus let us bend the knee as the greatest of the original Roman writers as the first historian who wrote with philosophy for his  guide as one whose judgment and talents were infinite and shall never be rivalled I am not unaware that Milton in his Familiar Let∣ters calls Salust the very first of all historians and Tacitus his imitator Tho I revere Milton I revere the truth more and think that Salust imitates Thucydides and Tacitus imitates none Salust deals merely in general reflec∣tions Tacitus in deep and political knowlege  BOETIUS the last Roman writer has a fair claim to originality and that not of the meanest kind  SUCH is the list of the more eminent Latin writers Among them we have found only  Eight  Original namely TIBULLUS HORACE CELSUS PHAEDRUS JUVENAL PLINY the Elder TACITUS BOETIUS and I suppose if weighed in the scales of Critical Justice their various powers of genius would rank them in this order  I TACITUS as a profound historian None having arisen before or since his genius must necessarily be of wonderful rarity and value  II TIBULLUS as the first writer of Elegy in the world  III JUVENAL A satyric writer of the sub∣lime or first class As satire is an inferior pro∣vince of poetry to elegy he stands after Tibul∣lus but as the sublime is superior to the ele∣gant he precedes  IV HORACE  V PLINY the Elder  VI CELSUS  VII PHAEDRUS  VIII BOETIUS  LETTER XLVI  THE distinction between learning and reading is very just A man may read all the books ever sent into the world were it possible and yet have no title to the appellation of learned A man of true learning by the digestion of a strong mind converts all literary food into wholsome nourishment whereas when the receptacle is disordered or feeble the more it is crammed the worse Such is Mil∣ton's idea  But knowlege is as food and needs no less  Her temperance over appetite to know  In measure what the mind may well contain  Oppresses else with surfeit and soons turns  Wisdom to folly as nourishment to wind  For a long time after the revival of learning it was confounded with reading An author could not call snow white without a long quotation from Aristotle in the margin This plan having fallen into just contempt we have now adopted the other extreme Voltaire an  ape who looks big by getting upon the shoul∣ders of giants after dirtying them all over in getting up writes history without ever quoting his authorities and tells us anecdotes as an∣cient which are not to be found in any ancient author in print yet he quotes no MS Shall we believe him No They are the offspring of his own brain Even for apparent facts he produces no authority yet history cannot be too well authenticated As he made his poetry history so he hath made his history poetry he is an historical poet and a poetical historian This is an instance that there are works in which it is absolutely necessary to shew one's learning by quotations and not by the essence of the discourse  FOR a man's writing on learned subjects with no display of erudition we can only account by pronouncing him ignorant The more a man hath read upon any subject he will doubtless write the better supposing him a man of any capacity Is not a rich man bet∣ter qualified to furnish a banquet that will delight every palate than one whose poverty frustrates his intention  NONE I confess are so fond of shewing their learning as those who have little of it Parson Adams you remember when shewing his half guinea all he had says he doth it not from ostentation of riches Have you never heard a man quote Horace in company and then with many apologies for being a man of learning translate the passage in such a manner as to evince that he had not even the rudiments of erudition Swift hath well observed that what a man wants in sense is supplied in vanity The observation is equally just when applied to learning for sound learning may be defined to be an appropriation of the sense of others  SUETONIUS in his books  De Illustribus Gram∣maticis  tells us that Cornelius Nepos to whom the work of Victor  De viris Illustribus  read in schools in spite of its bad Latin is ascribed wrote a treatise  De discrimine literati et eruditi  And one Poiret hath written a book  De erudi∣tione solida et falsa  I have not read it but the title is a good one Solid science I think may be defined That which is useful to man either individually or socially This definition in∣cludes elegant learning for what pleases a man  is highly useful to him The dispute whether poetry for instance is meant to be useful or pleasing is idle What is pleasing is useful Poetry is only useful by amusing The time is past when it preserved laws and gave social manners to savage nations The harp of Orpheus sounds no more This unexpected metaphor brings to my mind a droll anecdote told by Lucian in his treatise  Against an igno∣rant man who bought a number of books  which I shall beg leave to lay before you as a lively picture of the futility of any science when canvassed by inadequate powers of mind  WHEN the Thracian Bacchanals tore Or∣pheus to pieces they say that his harp was thrown into the river Hebrus with his bleed∣ing head upon it While the head sung a lamentable elegy on the fate of its late proprie∣tor the harp touched by the wind accompa∣nied it with a solemn strain till swimming down the Egean sea the mournful concert ar∣rived at Lesbos The Lesbians taking them up buried the head in the spot where in Lu∣cian's time stood the temple of Bacchus and hung up the lyre in the Temple of Apollo  Neanthus the son of Pittacus the tyrant who had heard the wonderful qualities of this harp that it tamed wild beasts and moved even trees and rocks and that since the time of Orpheus it had never been touched had a vio∣lent desire to try its effects With this view he bribed the priest who had it in keeping to give it to him and hang up one quite similar in its place Neanthus wifely thought it was not proper to use it by day nor in the city lest he should bring the houses about his ears but hiding it under his robe went by night to try it in the environs Being quite ignorant of music he began scraping upon it at a strange rate but with no small pride and satisfaction as deeming himself the worthy heir of the music of Orpheus The town dogs who I suppose were all turned loose into the streets at night as is now the custom in Turkey came to the sound in crouds Neanthus in transport imagined now the beasts had come the other effects would follow and looked sharp around to see if a rock and a tree were coming toward him dancing a minuet Poor man he was wofully deceived The dogs had only come thinking the strange noise pro∣ceeded  from a wolf or a wild hog and en∣raged by the horrid din tore its unfortunate author to pieces  TO return for I am wandering like Mon∣taigne tho with a juster title to wander there is no doubt but elegant literature forms a great branch of true learning being in fact nearly as useful to man as the most solid parts of it for poetry may be regarded as of almost equal uti∣lity with philosophy The one amuses life and diverts care by that sweet pliability of man's spirit which Sterne speaks of the other in∣structs us to lessen our care The effect is almost the same  USEFUL learning may often be distinguished from false by the congenial delight which the first affords to the human mind Nature hath exquisitely contrived that the true pleasure and the interest of man should walk hand in hand as she covers the fruit with the flower To this purpose I must again beg leave to quote Lucian for an observation as extensive as it is beautiful In his excellent work On writing history he tells us thatIn the propriety of  any thing lies its greatest beauty He is speak∣ing of false ornaments but take his own words for they should be written with letters of gold in the temple of Criticism  This sentiment may likewise be applied to pleasure and utility Nature having seldom separated them and having in particular sprinkled the paths of false science with thorns and those of the true with roses  THE inveterate antipathy of ignorance to science and of those possest of false learning to those inheriting the true is well known and is easily accounted for by the analogical aver∣sion of owls bats and other nocturnal mon∣sters to the light of the sun You cannot ima∣gine how easy it is for a blockhead to sneer at erudition It is sometimes very diverting to see ingenious and profound arguments detailed by a man of learning upon any point turned against him in high triumph by dunces who could never have thought of those arguments had not they been digged from the mines o  science with great labour and presented to them forged into Weapons  TRUE science we have defined to be that which is useful to man it follows that false science is that which is useless to him To this last kind many more branches of what is called knowlege may be referred than is gene∣rally imagined but to point them out without adducing reasons for classing them under false science were unjust and absurd and the pro∣duction of reasons would form a treatise and not a letter  AS I began with a quotation from Milton so I shall close with another  Ut pes et caput uni Reddantur formoe  Who reads  Incessantly and to his reading brings not  A spirit and judgment equal or superior  And what he brings what need he elsewhere seek  Uncertain and unsettled still remains  Deep verst in books and shallow in himself  Crude or intoxicate collecting toys  And trifles for choice matters worth a spunge  As children gathering pebles on the shore  LETTER XLVII  WHEN I lately gave you my thoughts upon the Advancement of Learning since the time of Lord Bacon I believe I did not speak of Moral Philosophy and Social Sci∣ence at so great length as the vast importance of those the grandest parts of knowlege would require The reason was that my Letter had before I came to these points exceeded all bounds and I was willing to make all the haste to a conclusion which I decently could But as I look upon these two articles as form∣ing the very essence of human wisdom and to be of themselves more weighty than all its other branches put together I now request your permission to present you with a few thoughts upon them expecting as usual to be favoured with yours in return that by the collision of our thoughts in this other species of conversation the flame of truth may be struck out  MORAL Philosophy considers man as an individual principally but as his transactions as an individual are of necessity blended with those of other individuals Social Science mingles with Moral Philosophy by impercep∣tible shades They had therefore better be united under the common title of THE ART OF LIFE  HOW surprizing is it my friend what a mortifying instance of the blindness of man to his prime interest that while other arts are so diligently explored by many penetrating minds this transcendent art the sovereign of all arts THE ART OF LIFE should be almost with propriety to be regarded as an undiscovered continent in the globe of science Yet how wide how noble a subject for didactic poetry and for the keenest and most diligent examina∣tion of philosophy  LORD BACON well observes that  Life con∣sists not in novelties or subtleties  It is in∣deed a trite observation that when a man hath seen one family he hath seen the world It follows that THE ART OF LIFE may with the  greatest propriety be defined and reduced to a science  TO do this with ease the middling rank the happiest and best of all cannot be described with too minute a detail This may be con∣sidered as the subject of the concerto to use a musical metaphor remarks and examples from the extremes of life may to pursue the figure be regarded as airs  THE ART OF LIFE can never be examined with too scrupulous a minuteness Every trifle is important to man himself a trifle and his life a trifle You cannot therefore expect that this Letter should enter into any detail it can only just hint at the chief divisions each of which deserves the acute investigation of a dif∣ferent author An author too out of the com∣mon run of authors an author who is a man of the world  THE chief heads of this ART would I sup∣pose be found to be these  FIRST  MAN AS AN INDIVIDUAL considered with regard to  I His body in  Its structure  The Natural History of Man  The art of preventing  The art of curing diseases  II His Mind leaving the metaphysic part out of all question and only examining it by its palpable faculties so to speak of  Judgment and reason  Me∣mory  Imagination  SECONDLY  MAN IN SOCIETY  I History of the Progress of Society  II Particular description of the civi∣lized state of society  III Advices for the further improvement of society  IV Domestic society considered in these subdivisions Duties and affections of  husband  Wife children  of parents  of friends c  Rules and most minute details of oeconomy and the conduct of life  Pleasures and amusements of life with hints for their im∣provement  V Civil society or the art of conducting every kind of business including the science of polished manners and what is called knowlege of the world  SUCH I imagine ought to be the general idea of this GRAND ART Some of its branches have been already cultivated but by no means with sufficient care Charron and Nettleton are perhaps the most important authors whose works in this way deserve any mention The  first of these in particular is a very valuable writer but neither of them come up to the idea proposed The grand reason why the practical happiness of man is so desert a field of observation is that he he hath never yet discovered that important things as theories of worlds c are trifles to him and trifling things as domestic pleasures c are to him matters of the last importance The happiness of man is compounded of a variety of minute particles of wisdom and pleasure it is an ex∣quisite concert produced by a variety of instru∣ments most of them very minute in them∣selves yet of great effect upon the whole Now no writer hath thought of laying down the art of tuning these several instruments No that were beneath the dignity of philoso∣phy It is judged enough to lay down rules for the concert without enquiring whether the instruments are in proper tune or not Hence to drop the metaphor the general titles of books on this subject On Virtue and Happi∣ness On Wisdom The writers did not know that their very titles were presumptuous to madness and that one hundredth part of their plan was far beyond the cultivation of any one  author This affectation of being important destroys the merit of all writers on this subject They did not know that they would have been infinitely more important had they been less so The saying of Parmenio to Philotas  My son make thyself less  may with great truth be applied to all practical writers on human wis∣dom with this implied addition  that thou mayest be greater  Man Proud Man Must thy pride be for ever the destruction of thy real knowlege and of thy happiness  I HAVE dwelt so long upon this preliminary part because it forms the very basis and foun∣dation of the ART now spoken of Till au∣thors can be persuaded to drop generalities and minutely examine particulars not upon theo∣retical but upon experimental principles it is in vain to expect any progress in this great science  MAN'S happiness which is the only final purpose of this ART hath been already ob∣served to be an aggregate composed of many minute parts Perhaps nothing contributes more to it than the knowlege of economy  yet not one book has ever been written upon this point tho nothing is more capable of being illustrated by details and examples  THIS may serve as an explanation of my meaning when recommending THE ART OF LIFE to be treated by philosophers at length in its minute heads not taken in gross I speak of examples because it is a trite observation that example goes further than precept and because without examples the several divisions of this knowlege will be more dry and far less instructive  THESE examples ought always if possible to be be taken from real life or to bear as strict a resemblance of it as possible at any rate they ought to be related in the simplest manner Indeed the whole works upon any branch of this science ought to be written in the most simple style imaginable being intended for the instruction of all ranks of society  ANY further remarks on this head I shall not venture upon I cannot however omit observing that in all well regulated govern∣ments a DOMESTIC TRIBUNAL should be in∣stituted  composed of respectable fathers of fa∣milies who should have power to regulate in a mild manner all serious disputes between fa∣ther and son or the like The vast power that parents have over the happiness of their chil∣dren gives many depraved parents an unli∣mited tyranny and the worst species of it for this always attacks the very vitals of domestic life whereas tyrannic government seldom or never goes so far Many parents make their children useless and miserable for life and dis∣inherit them in the end for no cause but their own diabolical caprice If children are diso∣bedient the parents can always punish them but if parents are tyrannical there is no redress for their unfortunate offspring The want of such a tribunal is a disgrace to the legal pru∣dence of every modern country for I think something like it actually existed in one or two of the states of antiquity  I MUST not conclude without remarking further that Lord Bacon's own hints upon civil society and business are very valuable as every sketch of such a master is they may be regarded with justice as forming a model of a series of documents upon this subject  LETTER XLVIII  NOBODY will deny that in some few passages of the Gerusalemme Liberata and those very minute Tasso hath admitted a style a little too figurative Yet it may with great justice be asserted that there are more blemishes in the Iliad than in the Gerusa∣lemme and I question not but there are even very near as many instances of excessive figure and false decoration or in short what our cri∣tics call tinsel But if Tasso should be found to exceed Homer in this which I very much doubt he hath many excuses which Homer had not such as the Platonic or metaphysical style introduced into Italian poetry by Pe∣trach Tasso's own fondness for Platonism and the very spirit of refinement which per∣vades Italian minds Italian thoughts and Italian language  THERE is no human work however perfect upon the whole that can be pronounced to be faultless Nay a faultless work is commonly an insipid one that is hath the greatest of faults is all one fault without particular faults Where a writer rises to uncommon excellence his mind feeble from the lofty flight will be apt to sink beneath even its com∣mon level This remark is as old as the time of Longinus who well marks the vast prefer∣ence to be given to an author who with great faults hath great beauties over him who hath neither fault nor beauty I do not however mean to apply it to Tasso whose faults are scarce and minute and his excellencies great and numerous  IN estimating the defects of a valuable au∣thor we should make ourselves his cotempo∣raries If Homer deserves pardon for the sim∣plicity of the manners he paints because in his time manners were quite of primitive simpli∣city doth not Tasso in like manner deserve favour for his style being now and then too figurative while we all know that the Italian style of his age was figurative to excess Do  not we pardon to Shakspere his quibbles and to Milton his religion Let us only make half the allowance for Tasso whose faults are not so numerous nor his merits of so high a rank and it is enough  THE worth of the Gerusalemme I may per∣haps be led to estimate on a future occasion The subject of my present Letter shall be an equitable enumeration of what are called the  conceits  to be found in it I have just finished a perusal of it made with a view to mark every one that arose and I doubt not but I have done it with a severe eye You shall have my list which I believe will be found neither incurious nor unuseful after I have observed that in Eleven of the Twenty Books of the Gerusalemme there is not the smallest shadow of too figurative a style These Eleven Books are the I III V VI VIII IX XI XIII XIV XV XVII The passages that are suspicious in the other books are as follow  No Move fortezza il gran pensier l'arresta  Poi la vergogna e'l virginal decoro  Vince fortezza anzi s'accorda e face  Se vergognofa e la vergogna audace  Canto II Stanza  TO this he seems to have been induced with a view to fill up his stanza another apology for some of his  concetti  not before mentioned  No Questo e quel fuoco ch'io credea che i cori  Ne dovesse infiammar d'eguali ardori  Canto II Stanza  This is Platonic and might have been writ∣ten by Petrarch  No E fra le selve  Fera a gli uomini parve uomo a le belve  II  No Ma il chiaro umor the di si spesse stille  Le belle gote e'l seno adorno rende  Opra effetto di foco il qual' in mille  Petti serpe celato e vi s'apprende  O miracol d'Amor che le faville  Tragge del pianto e i cor ne l'acqua accende  IV  PETRARCA again  No Ma di piu vago sol piu dolce vista  Misero i' perdo  VII  THIS would likewise have been written by Petrarch and to accuse Tasso of Petrarchisms would sound as impious in Italian cars as to arraign a writer of Miltonisms would in ours  both being in such admiration that imitations even of their faults are thought meritorious In Canto VIII  L'Alba con la fronte di rose e co pie d'oro  is rather bold but not to excess Fairfax well translates it  With roses crown'd and buskin'd high with gold  Homer's  rosy∣finger'd  Morn c are as bold to the full  No Ch' Apollo inaura  Le rose che l'Aurora ha colorite  Canto X Stanza  THIS just Criticism would pronounce false ornament tho Homer hath passages as glitter∣ing  No O sasso amato et onerato tanto  Che dentro has le mie fiamme e fuori il pianto  XII  This is justly regarded as the most exception∣able passage in the whole Poem yet it still goes not beyond the model of Petrarca The story of Tasso's affection for this couplet I re∣commend to your supreme contempt with that of Milton's admiration of Paradise Regained and other popular tales which are believed without vouchers and without probability  No Specchio t'e degno il cielo e ne le stelle  Puoi riguardar le tue sembianze belle  Canto XVI Stanza  This may justly be excused from the cruel necessity of completing a stanza  No O tu che porte  Parte teco di me parte ne lassi  XVI  This likewise smells of Petrarca  No E in lui trova impedita  Amor l'entrata it lagrimar l'uscita  XVI  No E gli sorgeva a fronte  Fatta gia d'auro la vermiglia aurora  XVIII  Fronte fatta d'auro  for  coronata d'auro  is bold but I believe not too much so and I think it might be excused from the example of Homeric diction  No Che rendendomi a me da me mi tolse  XIX  ON the same footing with No The war∣rior who dies with laughter because the spleen is wounded I suspect loses his life by mistake The passage is XX  No Che 'l cadavero pur non resta a i morti  Canto XX Stanza  No Vestirebbe mai forse i membri sui  Di quel diaspro ond' ei l'alma ha si dura  XX  SUCH is the list of all the passages in the Gerusalemme that can lie under the least im∣putation of too much art Is it long  THE rest of his style to the vast amount of about Sixteen Thousand lines is so well sus∣tained and rises frequently to such exquisite beauty as almost to confute the opinion of Longinus above adduced with regard to the necessity of great excellencies being accompa∣nied with equal blemishes His composition taken on the whole is most majestically grave and of itself sufficiently arraigns its accusers of calumny and falsehood Mere conceits and tinsel may be found in Guarini but they who look for them in Tasso must bring them along with them else they will not find them  IT is risible to observe Boileau the first to cry out  thief  with regard to Tasso when the only time he ever attempted poetry for his  satires and epistles his Imitations as he ought to have called them are only prose lace put in starch I mean in his  Ode sur la prose de Namur  he has written such pitiful tinsel as any Italian schoolboy would have blushed at being even suspected of  AT the same time let the apology of tem∣porary influence which hath power over the greatest writers be made for Addison himself a prose writer of the first rank for in his age French criticism was quite the vogue as I am affraid it is too much till this day As we now lead the French fashions in dress let us attempt to lead them in literature To attempt is to succeed  LETTER XLIX  IN the course of our correspondence I believe more than one occasion hath arisen of plac∣ing the critical abilities of Mr Addison in no high estimation But as perhaps stronger proofs may be required in the most innocent attack upon the slightest talents of a writer so de∣servedly eminent I shall if you please in this Letter produce these stronger proofs There is another reason which induces me to this disa∣greeable task and it is that the most minute failings of such an author deserve animadver∣sion for the rocks that have injured a vessel of such supreme rate would doubtless if not avoided with caution prove of immediate fata∣lity to critical adventurers of small size  THE only writings of Mr Addison worthy to be considered as pieces of criticism occur in the Spectator This view of his critical errors shall therefore be restricted to that work an  taken in the order in which they arise I  might be made ten times as long but I hurry thro it being sensible that the task is invidious and feeling it disagreeable  SPECT No Addison hath given more proofs than one of his very slight acquaintance with the Italian language Armida is in the opera of Rinaldo called an Amazonian enchantress or more properly an enchanting Amazon taking  enchanting  in rather an uncommon acceptation not from her being of the nation of the Ama∣zons as Addison strangely misunderstands it but from her being an enchantress and  virago  The remark on the Christian Magician is equally absurd The Magician doth not deal with the devil as Addison misrepresents it much in the spirit of an old woman but with angels the daemons of Platonism who were thought the servants of good men and none but the good Before such criticisms no work can stand The critic totally misrepresents the meaning and then writes criticisms upon his own misrepresentations The noted attack on Tasso which follows these odd blunders is dismissed in pity and silent contempt Tasso is innocent of the charge and must be honour∣ably  acquitted The English of Mr Addison's violent hatred of the opera is that he wrote for the English theatre and was mortified to see it neglected for the Italian  No Phaedra and Hippolitus is so woful a tragedy that I know no Italian opera that would not prove a far higher entertainment  No A perfect tragedy the noblest pro∣duction of human nature Where is epic po∣etry but Addison was writing Cato and his rules of criticism are always for his own ad∣vantage  HIS praise of Lee on this occasion and of Blackmore on another proves sufficiently the depth of his critical abilities  No The tragicomedy is the most natural and of consequence the most proper style of the drama Very little learning is required to know that it is not the product of the English stage but of every stage ancient and modern except the French which is sacred to Sleep  No Orestes's plea for not killing the Usurper instantly I believe strikes every reader as futile and a mere ancient stagetrick  No The praise of Bouhours by Addison and Chesterfield will never rescue him from the contempt of every man who hath read or thought much Good stomachs cannot be sa∣tisfied with syllabubs The critique on Gothic architecture shews the pitiful  gout de comparai∣son  Addison did not know that every Art ad∣mits of infinite modes of beauty and that to confine it to one of these modes is the reverse of an attempt to enlarge human knowlege and enjoyment  No This essay on Genius cannot be read without laughter and a certain assurance that the author knew not what it was  No What critic ever heard of an  heroic  poem Why examine a poem upon principles utterly inanalagous to it  I REMEMBER not that Aristotle allows that Homer's fable wants unity If he doth he is a poor critic if he doth not Addison is a poorer  THE perpetual quotations of Aristotle give disgust Why doth he never quote Nature  No A Greek's regard for Achilles must have been very small like the regard of a Spaniard for a Portuguese  No That the names of figures of speech were invented to palliate  defects  of speech is perhaps the only new critical remark Addison hath ever made and it is unhappily quite void of foundation Mr Addison forgot that gram∣mar was invented for speech not speech for grammar  No There is no occasion in Nature for an epic poem always ending happily If such a rule existed in the foolish axioms of criticism Milton knew to despise it Addison should have drawn new rules from Milton and not have pretended to judge him by foreign laws as he doth all along  No The criticism on the Third Book of Paradise Lost is not sufficiently severe It is all beneath the middling from beginning to end  No The device of Uriel's descent on a sunbeam is almost praised in Milton in Tasso it would have been tinsel Tasso hath nothing  so tinsical but thus it is when critics are ruled by prejudice and not by investigation  No The  golden compasses  ought to have been reprobated All metaphors applied from Art to Nature are the very reverse of sublime  No  The first original of the drama was a religious worship consisting only of a Chorus which was nothing else but an hymn to a deity  There are rather more errors in this sentence than words as I believe you will judge from former Letters The deity was Bacchus yet we are told in the next sen∣tence of  innocence and religion  Was Mr Addi∣son so very entire a stranger to Greek science as not to know that the worship of Bacchus was utterly inconsistent with innocence and religion  No We are now arrived at the greatest critical effort of Addison that on the pleasures of imagination One of the three causes which he lays down as productive of these pleasures is of no foundation Novelty never pleases ex∣cept when accompanied with the other causes Grandeur or Beauty The first sight of an ugly object only makes it more disgusting than when  use hath in some measure reconciled us to it Dr Akenside you will observe from a com∣munication I made to you some time ago had struck it out of his Poem very justly upon more mature consideration  IT is not novelty but beauty that makes natural objects more pleasing in the spring Beside they are new to no man Mr Addison surely did not mean his criticisms for those who had never seen the beauties of Spring before  No Mr Addison is the first writer who discovered that  final causes lie bare to our obser∣vation  Bacon would have said that final causes are utterly unknown to man Such is the difference between deep and superficial science Ignorance is always rash Knowlege doubts and trembles  No  For every thing that is majestic imprints an awfulness and reverence on the mind of the beholder and strikes in with the natural greatness of the soul  Bravissimo Cheese is cheese This is a lively instance of what they call criticism  I QUESTION if it was Phidias who proposed to cut Mount Athos into a statue of Alexander But I beg pardon for such a remark for nothing is more pardonable than a slip of this kind Indeed they who remember names and dates seldom remember any thing else  No Mr Addison tells us of the most agreeable talents of an historian and seems to think they consist in entertaining his reader If so fabulous historians are best The most  agreeable  talent of an historian is to  instruct  This is done by discussion of human actions and of the characters who were their agents  SUCH are the brief remarks which at present occur to me upon the critical errors of Addison Volumes might have been written to refute several of them but I know that to you they need only be hinted Besides I was quite im∣patient to get rid of this ungrateful task for Addison is one of my most favorite writers and nothing but my sacred love of critical equity could have been an inducement to its execution  THE best writers are perhaps the most liable to faults of a certain kind in like manner as fertile ground is where no grain is sown fertile of weeds Strong weeds speak a rich soil nearly as much as strong corn yet they ought to be rooted up that they may not injure the harvest  LETTER L  ACCORDING to your desire I now send you the Confessions of Rousseau per∣haps the most singular production that ever saw the light Nothing can more strongly prove the near alliance of great genius with madness  I KNOW of no work that can be mentioned as parallel to Rousseau's except Cardan's ac∣count of his own life I know not indeed which is the most extravagant Cardan's ac∣count of his seeing little brazen armies combat round his feet as he lay in bed of a morning and the like prodigies to be found in the very curious work  De Vita propria  or Rousseau's visions of his future happiness with Madame Warens and other day dreams  A PARALLEL in the manner of Plutarch might I think with ease be instituted between the two works Rousseau was of great reputa∣tion so was Cardan Rousseau superabounds  with extravagant egotism as well as the other Rousseau is sometimes almost sublime so is Cardan witness this passage of the IX Chapter of the latter on fame  Scribes inquam quo∣modo legenda et de qua re praeclara et adeo tibi nota ut desiderare legentes possint Quo stylo qua sermonis elegantia ut legere susti∣neant Sic ut legant Nonne aevo

our translations from the Eastern languages I am surprized that none hath yet appeared in English of the two great works of Musladin Sadi the Orchard and The Rosary or Flowergarden as they are quaintly intitled The original Persian I must confess my ignorance of but the latter translated into Latin by a Georgius Gentius in now lies before me and considered as an Eastern production of the Thirteenth century hath no small merit I know not if the first be yet translated  THE author of  Les Saisons Poeme  Paris I believe MS Lambert hath well trans∣lated a number of Sadi's apologues As I cannot find all his translations in the Rosary I take it that he hath given some of them from the other work called The Orchard Know∣ing your fondness for the Eastern apologue I inclose my translations of a number of them from both works for your amusement  APOLOGUE I  A KING had condemned one of his slaves to death The slave in the anguish of his despair knew no bounds but abused the prince his master with the most bitter reproaches What doth he say said the monarch to his favorite who stood near the slave Sir answered the favorite he says that the golden gates of para∣dise open of themselves to the merciful and he entreats your forgivenness with the most prostrate supplication I grant him forgiven∣ness said the king  A COURTIER who had been a long time the enemy of the favorite had heard the real words of the slave You are grossly deceived Sir said he to the Monarch that wretch re∣viles you in the most bitter terms The king answered the lye is the lye of humanity thy truth is the truth of cruelty Then turning to his favorite he said Oh my best friend thy words SHALL be the truth  APOLOGUE II  I WALKED with my friend during the great heat of the day under an avenue of lofty trees which afforded a shade impregnable to the blaze of the sun A rivulet ran by thro banks of the freshest and greenest turf I saw the visir Ka∣roun stretched upon that turf He was asleep  GREAT GOD said I doth not the remem∣brance of the evil he hath done prevent Karoun from enjoying the blessings of repose Doth the soft murmur of the sighs of the unhappy only sooth him to profound slumber  MY friend understood me and said God sometimes giveth sleep to the wicked that the good may be at rest  APOLOGUE III  A BLIND man had a wife whom he loved to excess tho he was told that she was very ugly A physician offered to cure him H  would not consent to it I should lose said he the love which I feel for my wife That lov  is my happiness  THE troops of Cosroes were vanquished the day of an eclipse of the sun The Persians adorers of the sun imagined that phenomenon denounced destruction to the empire This imagination extinguished every spark of their courage  ERROR may constitute the happiness of an individual but it is always the source of mi∣sery to a nation  APOLOGUE IV  ONE day I went home with a mind filled with chagrin After having in my heart sa∣tirized all conditions of men and even myself I fell into a profound sleep and had a dream I imagined myself transported to a solitude re∣mote from the vices and follies of mankind I walked with tranquil joy in a large forest which I thought protected my cottage from the violent winds of Arabia and forgot in its shades the caprices of life  THE sun arose His rays gilded the verdure over my head with feeble transparency I heard  the songs of a multitude of birds I was atten∣tive to all their accents I observed the diversity of their forms of their plumage of their flight  HEAVEN lent me of a sudden the power of understanding their several dialects The eagle railed at the owl on her weakness of sight the turtle dove spoke very ill of the hawk who expressed contempt for his weakness the black∣bird was very jocose on the cry of the eagle the jay and the magpie mocked each other they reproached the crow with his melancholy appearance and said that the sparrow had a vulgar look  THERE suddenly descended from heaven a most extraordinary apparition It was a youth whose colour resembled roses sprinkled over pure snow by some playful virgin of Circassia His wings were of the most delicate azure and their edges streaked with gold as the beams of the morning streak the summer sky His locks were black as ebony His eyes were blacker than ebony No hypocrite could bear their piercing radiance which went to the bottom of the soul He alighted on a lofty planetree  whose height surpassed the cedars of the forest He called the different birds by their names They obeyed and flocked around him perch∣ing on the branches of the surrounding cedars They trembled in silence He spoke  HEAR what I reveal to you by command of the Most High Ye are all equal in merit in his sight Ye only differ in qualities because ye are destined to different functions  THOU the eagle art born for war thy cry expressive of force cannot have harmony The owl could not have caught reptiles and insects of which she was made to clear the earth if her eyes of minute and nocturnal vision could have met the blaze of the meridian sun The nightingale and linnet it is true are of delicate constitution but how else could they possess delicacy of song The turtle is made for love the hawk for rapine Remain in your respective conditions without regret and without pride There are differences in your kinds but there are no faults  AT these words I saw the birds disperse thro the forest and the genius flew to heaven dart∣ing at me a look that spoke  I WAKED and said shall I then expect from the cadi the mildness of the courtier From the iman the freedom of the warrior From the merchant the disinterestedness of the sage From the sage the activity of the ambitious O heavenly spirit it is Sadi whom thou hast instructed Thy lessons shall be engraven on my heart and my lips shall repeat them to the sons of men  O MY brethren we depart together but on different voyages some to the north and others to the regions of the sun We require not the same clothes nor the same provisions We live in a family of which the father hath furnished us with very different accoutrements Why should he who prunes the vines hold the instruments of tillage  APOLOGUE V  THREE inhabitants of Balck travelled in company They found a treasure and divided it among them then continued their journey conversing together on the use which they meaned to make of their riches The victuals  which they had brought along with them were consumed they agreed that one of them should go to the city for more while the other two waited his return in a pleasant spot where they intended to dine The youngest accepted the commission and departed  HE said to himself on the way I am rich but I would have been much more so had I been alone at the time of finding this treasure These men are the robbers of my richesCan I not resume them Yes with ease I have only to poison the victuals which I am about to buy At my return I will say I have dined in the city My companions will eat and die without suspicion I have now only the third of the treasure I will then have all  MEANWHILE the two other travellers said to each other It was foolish to allow that younker to associate with us We have been obliged to share the treasure with him His part would have much augmented ours and we should without him have been rich indeed But he returns and we have swords  THE young man returned with the poisoned provisions His companions were his assassins They eat They died The treasure was again to find again to be the source of crimes  APOLOGUE VI  A KING of Chorazan said to his visir The people of Bactriana are commanded by a prince of feeble talents and without experience They have no allies and the conquest is easy As∣semble my forces and march against them  I OBEY answered the visir but by what right will you ravish their liberties from a nation who are not your foes  THAT conquest said the king will encrease my power Is it a crime to signalize my cou∣rage and extend my empire  CAN it be innocent replied the visir to give your subjects and the world an example of in∣justice  APOLOGUE VII  COSROES caused this inscription to be en∣graven on his diadem  Many have possessed this Many will possess it O posterity thy steps will be imprinted on the dust of my tomb  APOLOGUE VIII  IN proportion as time hath made to pass be∣fore my eyes a larger number of events and since the colour of my hair is that of the swans who sport in the waters of the garden of the great king I have thought that the supreme Arbiter of our lot who made man and virtue never leaves without pleasure the heart of the good nor a benevolent action without reward Hear sons of men Hear this faithful recital  IN one  hese fertile vallies which intersect the chain of the mountains of Arabia lived for a long time a rich and ancient shepherd I knew him well They called him happy He was con∣tent One day that he walked on the brink of a torrent thro an alley of palm trees the brown  foliage of which diversified the verdure of the cedars that crowned the surrounding hills he heard a voice which sometimes filled the vale with piercing cries and of which the melting murmurs were at other intervals not distin∣guishable from the sound of the stream  THE old shepherd ran to the spot from whence the voice arose He beheld at the foot of a rock a young man halfreclined upon the sand His clothes were torn His locks fell in disorder over his face in which beauty shone thro the thick shade of grief as the sun from a morning cloud His cheeks wet with tears his head bent on his bosom he re∣sembled a rose dashed with the summer storm The rich shepherd was moved He accosted the youth and said Son of misery come to my arms Let me press to my bosom the man of grief He is my brother His sorrow is mine  THE young man lifted his head in profound silence He looked upon the ole man as aso∣nished that benevolence and pity were yet ex∣isting on earth The sole appearance of the venerable shepherd inspired immediate confi∣dence  His moist eyes were full of softness and sympathetic fire They had that tender∣ness which makes the unhappy speak  RISING from the ground the youth threw himself into the arms of the shepherd calling with a voice that made all the circling hills resound O Father O more than father When he was calmed a little by the conversa∣tion and caresses of the old man he thus an∣swered his repeated questions  BEHIND these lofty cedars at the foot of the highest of these mountains stands the house of ShelAdar father of Fatmé The hut of my father is not far from thence Fatmé is the most beautiful of the daughters of the hills I offered myself to guide the flocks of her father and he consented to it He is rich The father of Fatmé is richand my father is poor I love Fatmé Fatmé returns my affection Her father perceived it we confessed our loves to him and he wishes to constrain me to leave the country in which his daughter dwells I threw myself at his feet and said O father of Fatmé let me at least reside with my father  I consent never more to speak to Fatmé I will never enquire of her heart I will promise that I will not But give me to conduct one of thy most remote flocks O permit me at least to serve the father of Fatmé ShelAdar hath re∣fused me all He hath treated me with harsh∣ness while I had not strength to flie from his house even before his violence He threatens Fatmé Alas I am now distant from her habi∣tation Fatmé is unhappy My father is infirm My mother is no more I have two brethren so small that they could hardly reach the lowest branches of these palm trees My father and my brothers received all their subsistence from me The bounty of ShelAdar is no longer my support Can misery be equal to mine  MY son said the old man let us go together to the pastures of ShelAdar I will assist thee to walk Come The youth consented to it he dragged his steps along with much difficulty Drawing near to the residence of ShelAdar they beheld his daughter She was lost in melancholy The young man said to the aged Behold Fatmé The shepherd without reply entered the house of ShelAdar and spoke to him thus  A DOVE of Aleppo was carried to Damascus She lived there with a mate of the country Their master fearing the dove of Aleppo would one day return and entice the other with her had them put them asunder They no longer would eat the grain which he held to them from his own hand They both sickened They died  O SHELADAR divide not those who only live because they live together This young man whom thou hast driven from thy house is he a son of virtue  SHELADAR answered The prophet be my witness in what I am about to speak As the white lily in a bed of narcissuses is that youth among the faithful He surpasses all the young shepherds in piety goodness and vigilance Buthe is poor  AH said the old shepherd I and my sons have flocks without number I possess all the rich valley of Horafa The riches of the young man shall be my care A large portion of my slocks shall be at thy door on the morrow providing thou wilt give him Fatmé  SHELADAR knew the fame of the old shep∣herd He promised his daughter The vene∣rable ancient retired  ON the morrow he sent to the residence of ShelAdar a number of flocks more white than the snow on the tops of the mountains in winter and herds of horses more beautiful and nimble than those that carried the prophet  SOME days after this worthy action the rich and good shepherd went towards the cedars beneath which stood the dwelling of ShelAdar Attend O sons of men attend  THE good shepherd was leaving a grove and entering on a meadow thro which ran a stream bordered with figtrees He saw upon the grast ShelAdar who held the hand of an old man whose countenance expressed wisdom and gaiety The old shepherd saw them and stopped to en∣joy all the pleasure which the sight of the hap∣piness of his brethren in age could afford The old men had a number of youths about them among whom were two children who some∣times played on the grass and then would come to caress the two fathers They were  wellclad they had all the health vivacity and gaiety of their age The good shepherd easily understood that these children were the brothers of the young husband of Fatmé and that the old man who held ShelAdar by the hand was their father  NIGHER to the good shepherd by the shade of the grove Fatmé and her husband sat on the grass In motionless rapture they often looked upon each other with intense eagerness They smiled so sweetly that it seemed that pleasure alone had ever printed its vestige on their faces Often the young couple interrupted their delicious silence by lively but modest caresses One might see that they were re∣strained by the presence of their fathers Often they looked around them and appeared intoxi∣cated with the felicity of all that was dear to them more than even with their own Their joy which inspired all the company manifested itself equally in all their faces as the same sap produces like flowers on all the branches of the orangetree  THE good shepherd looked on each of them by turns He then chanced to turn his eyes toward the neighbouring meadows He beheld the flocks which he had given to ShelAdar They surpassed those of ShelAdar among which they were mingled and were distin∣guishable by their superior whiteness and beau∣ty Their guides sung the happiness of their masters and their own own  SONS of men ye have heard my faithful recital Be virtuous ye poor that the rich may be benevolent Be benevolent ye rich that the poor may be virtuous  APOLOGUE IX  NOURSHIVAN the Just being one day a hunting would have eaten of the game which he had killed but from the consideration that after dressing it his attendants had no salt to give it a relish He sent at last to buy some at the next village but with severe injunctions not to take it without paying for it What would be the harm said one of his courtiers if the king did not pay for a little salt Nourshi∣van  answered If a king gathers an apple in the garden of one of his subjects on the morrow the courtiers cut down all the trees  APOLOGUE X  A VIRTUOUS king in an angry moment ordered one of his slaves who was innocent to be put to death O king said he my pu∣nishment ends with my life thine begins at the close of mine He was forgiven  APOLOGUE XI  THE son of Aaron AlRaschid came to him with bitter complaints against a man who had slandered his mother and demanded vengeance O my son said Aaron AlRaschid thou art about to be thyself the worst slanderer of thy mother by persuading the world that she hath not taught thee to forgive  APOLOGUE XII  A MAN had quitted the society of the der∣vises and entered into that of the philosophers What difference do you find said I to him between a philosopher and a dervise He an∣swered Both swim across a great river with their brethren of men The dervise keeps at a distance from the company that he may swim at ease and arrive alone on the opposite shore The philosopher on the contrary swims with the rest and often stretches forth his hand in their assistance  APOLOGUE XIII  NOURSHIVAN the Just being but prince of Chorazan and subject of the king of kings loved pleasures and lived splendor his riches were bounteously disposed far and near The most excellent singers the most skilful musicians came to entreat his audience and the first audience made them opulent When he at length sat upon the throne of the world they flocked from all parts of the earth He  heard them with pleasure but paid them with far less liberality than when he was a subject prince One of the musicians dared to com∣plain May heaven said he be propitious to Nourshivan Empire hath enlarged his wealth and contracted his mind Ye kings write the answer of the Just in letters of gold and while ye read it every day after your morning devotions again bend the knee in adoration for the deity spoke by his mouth Nourshivan sail FORMERLY I GAVE MY OWN MONEY NOW I GIVE THAT OF MY PEOPLE  APOLOGUE XIV  A KING of Persia had extended an hand of iniquity over his people he held them in abject slavery and augmented their misery by open scorn Impatient of the harsh and hu∣miliating yoke the greater part of his subjects left their country and sought a refuge among strangers The revenues of the prince dimi∣nished with the number of his subjects His neighbours profited by his folly His states were attacked and the discontented soldiers defended them feebly He was dethroned  A KING ought to nourish his people even with his own substance because he holds his kingdom of his people Every subject is the soldier of a just king  APOLOGUE XV  A KING on his coming to the throne had found immense wealth in the coffers of his father The hand of magnificence was opened and the riches of the prince were diffused among the people A visir reproached the prince upon this If an enemy said he at∣tacks your frontiers how will you defend yourself after having distributed your money among your SUBJECTS Then replied the king I will borrow it of my FRIENDS  APOLOGUE XVI  A RELIGIOUS man was much respected in Bagdad for his sincere virtue and both the great men and the people thought that his prayers took heaven by storm Haschas Jo∣seph tyrant of Bagdad came to him and said  Pray God for me Great God said the reli∣gious lifting his hands to heaven take Has∣chas Joseph from this world Wretch thou cursest me said the tyrant I ask of heaven replied the pious the greatest favour it can grant thee and thy people  APOLOGUE XVII  THE wise Zirvan after having enjoyed the confidence of the great Dachelim king of the Indies and the esteem of all his people was persecuted by the visir Sourac Zirvan beheld himself stripped of his wealth and employ∣ments His wife died of sorrow His son would have comforted himHis son was in chains  ZIRVAN with eyes full of tears went every day into the garden of the great Dachelim There he lay at the foot of a palmtree and related to it his innocence and his misfortunes  A YOUNG man of the court saw and heard him What said he dost thou complain to that tree Dost thou think it sensitive  AS man is answered Zirvan and it doth not interrupt me  APOLOGUE XVIII  A YOUNG king gave himself up to dissipa∣tion and to all the pleasures prepared for him by those infamous courtiers who build their hopes on the weakness of their master One day he sung at a feast these words I have en∣joyed the past I enjoy the present and am not solicitous of the future A beggar sitting under the hallwindow heard the king and exclaimed If thou art not solicitous about thy own lot thou oughtest to be about ours  THE king was struck with the speech He approached the window looked upon the poor man with attention and without speaking to him ordered him a large sum of money then left the hall in silence He reflected upon his past life It had been opposite to all his duties He was ashamed of himself He assumed the reins of government which he had till then entrusted to his favorites He laboured assidu∣ously and in a little time he reestablished the order and happiness of the empire  COMPLAINTS were in the mean while often made to him about the licentious life of the poor man whom he had enriched At last he came one day to the gate of the palace covered with his old rags and begging alms The king shewed him to one of the wise men of the court for he had loved wise men since he had loved virtue and said Behold the effects of my goodness I loaded that wretch with wealth and my benevolence hath only corrupted him Riches have been to him the source of new vices and of new misery It is true said the sage because thou hast given to poverty the rewards of labour  APOLOGUE XIX  I FOUND one day on the sea shore a virtu∣ous labourer whom a tiger had almost de∣voured He was on the point of expiring and in great agony Great God said he I thank thee I suffer pain but not remorse  APOLOGUE XX  THE son of Nourshivan saw one day a sage who had his eyes and arms lifted to heaven and his face turned toward the east He made to God this prayer O great God extend thy pity and benefits to the wicked For the good it suffices that they are good  APOLOGUE XXI  A YOUNG man being intoxicated with wine fell asleep by the side of the highway A reli∣gious passing along some time after bitterly reviled him The youth now sober thro sleep raised his head and said If good men pass a sinner they pass him with benevolence  APOLOGUE XXII  ABU HURURA used to think it his duty often to see Mustapha to whom God be merciful Mustapha one day said to him O Abu Hurura see me seldom that love may increase  APOLOGUE XXIII  A FOX running very fast was met by a civet cat What crime have you committed said the cat that you should flie so swiftly The fox answered I flie because I heard hunters in the field who said they wished very much for a camel Is there any likeness between you No said the fox but if any of my enemies came in and called me a camel I know there would be no further enquiries  APOLOGUE XXIV  I REMEMBER that in my youth having no∣tions of severe piety I used to rise in the night to watch pray and read the holy Koran One night that I had never slept but was wholly employed in those exercises my father a man of practical virtue awaked while I was reading the Koran with silent devotion Behold said I to him thy other children are lost in religious slumber while I alone wake to praise God Son of my soul he answered it is better to sleep than wake to remark the faults of thy brethren  LETTER LII  A PROMISE is with me a matter of most A religious consideration and as you are pleased to remind me of one I made to you on a former occasion with regard to Tasso's Geru∣salemne I hasten to fulfil it by submitting to you anestimate of the merits of that work  TO proceed on this after the manner in which Mr Addison hath treated the Paradise Lost vill be most eligible that is first to consider the faults of the work then to exa∣mine is worth under the distinct heads of Fable with its incidents Persons and Lan∣guage  THE faults of language have already been discussed in a former Letter to which I refer those that remain for present animadversion belong to the incidents and characters and the defects of both are happily minute and rare  THE only incident which I can condemn in the whole fable is to be found in the Thirtythird and following stanzas of the Fourteenth Canto and a few stanzas of the Fifteenth The story of the old Magician his connexion with Peter the Hermit his dwelling XV c are all unnatural to excess  ineredulus odi  To a good Christian's being a Magician in Lord Bacon's sense I cannot confirm Mr Ad∣dison's objection The popular superstition hath white wizards and black wizards magicians who deal with the demons of Platonisin and with devils The Eastern creed makes Salo∣mon a magician and pious prince without sus∣picion of dissonancy It is not therefore to this person's being a pious magician that I object but to the unnecessary miracles that are diffused around him not to the Character but to the Incidents which attend it  WITH regard to the faulty Characters in the Gerusalemme I think that there are far too many female warriors in it We are obliged to Virgil for the first personage of this sort the vere sense of Homer admitted no such dreams Dacier hath well observed that a circumstance  that is positive fact in real life might yet be much too improbable for poetry We know from history that Vermina the daughter of Syphax was in the field fighting in assistance of Hannibal when he received his last defeat from Scipio a circumstance which being so recent probably suggested Camilla to Virgil We know from history the martial spirit of Bonduca of many Scandinavian ladies and the like yet all these will not vindicate the ad∣mission of female warriors into poetry where the GRAND TRUTH OF NATURE is the object not the paltry truth of fact Tasso hath how∣ever a very strong apology to offer for his sometimes making the word  warrior  of the feminine gender and that is the coincidence of his story with the times and manners of chi∣valry times and manners which presented so many instances of this solecism in  costume  as almost to elevate truth of fact into truth of nature  SO much for the faults of the Gerusalemme they are not many yet the eye of critical justice will never be able to find more The beauties fortunately present themselves at more length  THE FABLE is certainly one of the very best for epic poetry that ever was chosen It is superior to that of the Iliad as much as the Sepulchre of Christ was thought at the period of the action and to which in all poetry we must ever accommodate our minds to exceed the value of a strumpet as much as the object of the most zealous adoration of half the globe was superior to the  teterrima belli causa  THE Fable was so grand and general had Tasso managed it to its utmost advantage as to interest every nation in Europe by the detail of the exploits of its own warriors It may indeed be noted as a blemish in the conduct of the fable that Tasso is always an Italian and not an European He never dwells with appa∣rent satisfaction but upon the glorious deeds of his own countrymen who had in fact the smallest share in the enterprise Homer's fable only nationally interested the Greeks and neighbouring states Tasso's might have na∣tionally interested every country of Europe had he used it with proper liberality As it stands it is a great and interesting Fable to every reader tho it must at the same time be  confessed that it might have been rendered more so to an infinite degree  MOST of the INCIDENTS must be allowed to have great novelty and merit None of them are foreign to the work or can properly be called episodes like Virgil's of Dido which hath no sort of relation to his fable The in∣cident of Olindo and Sophronia tho one of the most detached is infinitely more a part of the Gerusalemme than the adventure with Dido is of the Eneid and were it much less so its eminent beauty must preclude it from all cen∣sure if we condemn it we must crown it with laurel Most of the incidents have moreover that pleasing air of miracle which offends not probability and affords the genuine pleasure of poetry to the reader Those incidents around which this fairy light is not cast maintain their native force with great dignity and in∣terest The grand incident of Armida's inter∣vention with its consequences is masterly to a supreme degree the miraculous is throout carried to all its height yet with the constant preservation of a severe probability The de∣parture of Rinaldo from the camp is artfully  managed Had he left it with the herd of warriors who followed Armida the dignity of his character would have suffered violation A stronger cause and worthy of the effect pre∣sents itself to us and saves the fame of Rinaldo and of Tasso  THE subsequent amorous adventures of Rinaldo and Armida Tasso appears to me to have taken the hint of from those of Mars and Venus as beautifully painted by the celebrated Agnolo Poliziano in his  Stanze  written up∣wards of half a century before the Gerusa∣lemme If you have not read the Italian poetry of Poliziano you have a great pleasure yet to come His  Stanze  are exquisite and his Dithy∣rambic Ode beginning  Ognun' sequa Baccho te  Baccho Baccho evoe  Chi vol bever chi vol bevere  Vegna a bever vegna qui c  to be found at the end of his  Orfeo  deserves high praise The best edition of his  Stanze  c is that of Padua  TO return The pastoral incident in the Seventh book is a delicious relief from the scenes of war and horror which precede it Nothing can have a more pleasing effect on the imagination than such contrasts when managed with artificial propriety The return to pros∣spects of the greatest horror and sublimity in nature which the after part of this Seventh Book presents is still an example of the happy effect of contrast of incident which is never perceived but by a reader of some taste whereas contrast of character is glaring and of no art or effect It is always a sure mark of a writer's inexperience in portraits when he is obliged to set them off by foils  THE incident of the death of Sueno and his host in the Eighth Book seems to me more of an unnecessary episode than the tale of Olindo and Sophronia so much objected to by small critics It may be historic truth for aught I remember for I have not now the  Gesta Dei per Francos  at hand but I fear it is not poetic truth  Cui bono  What purpose doth it serve Yet after all he must be a severe critic who would range it with the faults of the Gerusalemme  It bears a general connexion with the piece in different minute after relations which is surely enough for its vindication Can so much be said for the ghost of Dido  TO dwell on all the incidents of the Geru∣selemme were inconsistent with my purpose I shall therefore content myself with proceed∣ing to hint at only the principal Soliman's introduction to Aladin in the Tenth Book is a very great improvement on that of Ulyses to Alcinous in the Seventh book of the Odyssey The whole adventure with Ismeno is masterly and superlatively pleasing to the imagination Tasso's very imitations are in that original style which I think you before agreed is the only possible merit which imitation can have and in fact none but original writers can imi∣tate in this way  The story of Clorinda is evidently built up∣on the Ethiopic History of Heliodorus a work of the very first merit The incident of her dying by the hands of Tancred her lover is artfully wrought up and hath no small claim to the pathetic  IN the Thirteenth Book the enchanted wood and apparition of the city of fire are incidents of miracle  speciosa miracula  which approach to the sublime The principal incident of the next Canto hath already been mentioned in terms of reprobation  IN the Fifteenth Canto the voyage of the two warriors is exquisitely pleasing to the imagination Tasso in the first edition of his poem made them go to America and beyond but well altered this and confined their voyage to the length of the Canary or Fortunate islands Indeed it was violation of probability to suppose that three persons natives of Europe were in America in the Eleventh century and yet that continent remain undiscovered till the Fifteenth tho these Europeans returned in safety to a whole army of their countrymen and must have been supposed to have related this adventure to them in terms of due admi∣ration The fifteen rescinded stanzas are how∣ever well worthy of Tasso and as I dare say you have not seen them I shall give you one or two  THE first describes the cross a constellation of the southern hemisphere  Miran quasi duo nuvoli di molte  Luci in un congregate e in mezzo a quelle  Girar con angustissime rivolte  Due pigre e brune e picciolette stelle  E sovra lor di Croce in forma accolte  Quattro piu grandi luminoze e belle  Eccovi i lumi opposti al freddo Plaustro  Che qui segnano disse il Polo d' Austro  Miran due merghi indi con l' ale molli  Quasi radendo andar l' onda marina  La fatal donna a i duo Guerrier mostrolli  Per segno the la ripa e gia vicina  Et ecco di lontano oscuri colli  Scopron de l'umil terra peregrina  Lor nel petto un desio subito viene  Di lasciar l' acque e di calcar l' arene  These two describe the pacific ocean and the isles on one of which Armida's station was at first placed by Tasso  Escon del breve stretto al oceano  Vasto et immenso il qual co venti ha tregua  Si ch' onda pur non dissaguaglia il piano  Cui stabil calma a quasi eterna adegua  Or perche 'l corso che da senno umano  Retto non e rapidamente segua  Spinge sempre soave e sempre eguale  Gli avventurosi erranti aura fatale  A destra é lungo tratto e quivi e il Guito  E co'l ricco Peru l'aurea Castiglia  Ma la nave seguendo it manco lito  Ver la terra anco ignota il cammin piglie  E trova un mar si d' Isole fornito  Che l' Egeo con le Cicladi somiglia  E gia da che lasciar l' arene Ibere  Eran dieci albe scorse e dieci sere  IN the Sixteenth Canto the incident of Ri∣naldo's immediate assent to the persuasions of the two warriors is much too rapid As it was the hinge upon which the crisis of the poem turned no art should have spared to render it interesting by many difficulties and solutions The warriors inducing Rinaldo to listen to the expostulations of Armida is an ar∣ticle still more unfortunate It was their part to hurry him off his to delay  The circumstance in the next book of the Soldan of Egypt giving the command of his vast forces to a lieutenant is very ill imagined It's being conformable to history were no ex∣cuse Had the soldan led them himself and  fought himself with Godfrey and fallen by his hand more grandeur and more interest would have accrued to the catastrophe of this immortal poem Not to mention that a lieute∣nant was an improper personage to be the com∣mander of so many auxiliary kings  THE incidents in the Eighteenth Canto are as usual with Tasso very well ordered The scenes in the next are an exquisite relief from the repetition of general battles which is so apt to disgust Erminia's meeting with Tancred is most artfully contrived and wrought up to no mean share of pathos The adventures of Vafrino have all that interest which extreme danger such as must always attend the most dishonourable office of a spy never fail to raise  IN the Twentieth and Last Book Tasso hath drawn from History the most grand and in∣teresting catastrophe of any epic poem in the world without exception The city of Jeru∣salem is taken the sepulchre of Christ freed in the Eighteenth Book What then re∣mained History tells us that four or five  days after the taking the holy city the vast forces of the sultan of Egypt amounting to near infantry and horse came to assail the victors now weakened by repeated conflicts to about men if I remember right Victory however declared in favour of the Christians with a slaughter of the enemy almost unparalleled What a glorious catas∣trophe A catastrophe at the same time abso∣lutely necessary to fulfil the event Tasso hath availed himself of it as indeed a writer of half his talents must have done It hath al∣ready been remarked that it might have been heightened but as it stands I do not hesitate to pronounce it the grandest close that an epic poem can possibly have  NOT to intrude too much on your patience the further consideration of this wonderful poem shall be deferred till a future occasion  LETTER LIII  THE hypocrisy you laugh at is very com∣mon Literature hath its hypocrisies as well as religion That which you mention in terms of just derision is one of the most fre∣quent where a man who is sensible that he hath studied a branch of science much and knows the value of his opinions concerning it yet pretends to submit with modest deference to the sentiments of people whose ignorance he knows to conviction Can any hypocrisy be more gross Were it not much more manly to assume that noble  confidentia sui  one of the best of the ancient virtues the parent of many other virtues but now unknown to us or unknown as a virtue Is sincerity that noblest attribute of the moral character of man to be sacrificed on the altar of false modesty  FROM principles of the same hypocrisy we often see opinions contrary to truth but which happen to be affirmed by writers of established  reputation assented to in silence by others of equal talents who know their falsity but dare not set their judgment against that of authors of celebrity not from modesty for that man cannot be found who will confess the mind of another to be superior to his own but from base hypocrisy of modesty Independent of this vice of simulation Science would advance in the world with double rapidity Names and pretended deference to them have been the great barriers in every age that have con∣fined knowlege to half its proper bounds  A YET more glaring literary hypocrisy is that by which an ignorant man assumes the garb of science as the worst hypocrisy in the moral world is that by which a vicious man assumes the mask of religion In the latter a hypocrite may often be discovered by pushing his simulation too far and in the like manner a literary impostor is apt not to display too much learning for he hath got none but to use the character of a learned man in the ex∣treme He shakes his head at the most trivial question and with many hems and ha's says it is a difficult point a very difficult point in∣deed  and would require very mature examina∣tion When any person present says the point is very easy takes it in hand and solves it to the satisfaction of every body the hypocrite of learning shakes his head says that solution is trivial and perhaps is polite enough to hint that it equals the understanding of the audi∣ence but that he upon proper occasion and to a learned company could have given a much more profound account of the matter  YOU cannot imagine my dear friend what an important thing a shake of the head is It makes a man look so wise I have known people get fame pleasure opulence only by shaking their heads tho God knows to use a trite witticism there was nothing in them A shake of the head from an ignorant man is learning from a mean man greatness from a dull man wit from a stupid man genius from a poor man wealth from a fool wis∣dom I wonder no wit should have written a treatise  On the art of shaking the head  It were surely capable of much illustration and no writer need be ashamed of handling it when he hath the example of Mr Addison before  him who hath written at some length  On the art of furling the fan  an instrument of equal ventosity But least you should be shaking your head at me all this while I shall here close my Letter  LETTER LIV  I HAVE heard it seriously debated in con∣versation that it is impossible for any writer to obtain a false fame and that celebrity must ever be the fruit of some proportion able merit This opinion as false as it is plausible de∣serves a confutation at some length from its important consequences to the interests of lite∣rature  THE fame of a good writer resembles the descent of a pyramid most minute at first but swelling to an enormous base which stands firm as the earth and defies every tempest and even the silent waste of time False fame resembles the pyramid likewise in every thing but its durability but in another view for it rises from a broad base and tapers to nothing Hence that applause which is wide at first is very seldom lasting and durable reputation almost always springs from very minute begin∣nings  A good writer is seldom or never popular at first His ideas are so much out of the common line that he is not understood much less tasted by the mob of his day True judges men of real science are always his first ad∣mirers from congeniality of mind and his fame when swelled to a vast river is yet of the utmost purity because its scources are clear The applause of true judges is the only living fame which a writer of true taste can relish When popular acclamation rises around him he will be ready to say with that an∣cient Greek upon hearing an unexpected roar of praise from the populace whom he was ad∣dressing  Have I said a foolish thiug  THE opinion of men of learning always leads the mob when it hath had a proper pe∣riod to operate the opinion of the mob is seldom or never that of men of learning and in no instance can lead it  THE fame of the most superlative writers is even after thousands of years always confined to superior minds the popular acclaim is only an unmeaning echo of it Du Bos hath well  observed that the true reputation of Homer is at this day confined to those who can read and admire him in the original perhaps amounting to two hundred persons in the world his other pretended admirers disgrace his genuine fame and are the mere babbling echoes of the former  THE like may be said of every superlative writer Is Pindar is Tacitus the minion of the populace Our own Milton our Shakspere universal as he is are not understood or the least relished by one person in a thousand who echo their celebrity with open mouth Were the genuine sentiments of the million enquired into it would be discovered that any fashion∣able bauble of the diurnal kind is of far more estimation in their sight that the immortal labours of these glorious writers What is the use of diamonds to them Can they eat them No with the cock in the fable grains of corn were better and where corn is not to be had even chaff  BUT before the breeze of time that chaff vanishes while diamonds remain and blaze to eternity  MEN of superior talents have it not in their power to adjust the reputation of a work at once They must have time to consider it Perhaps the author is known to many of them and they tremble at the suspicion of partiality Perhaps they are careless perhaps they are in∣vidious perhaps they are foes of the author  MEANWHILE a work of real merit is sure to be neglected for where shall the cattle go when there is no guide The little craft are coasting round their own paltry shores and know not that a new world is discovered If they did how shall they sail to it without powers and without a compass The small fishes they find at home are enough for them they leave the exploration of the treasures of other climates to those who are in possession of superior means of navigation  THE fame of few writers whose works are not of a more temporary kind can be estimated in the century in which they live One hundred years of purgatory may with great justice be looked upon as assigned to most authors before they pass to paradise or damna∣tion  ROUSSE AU I think observes that the path to true fame like that to the temple of virtue is most arduous and difficult and it may be added that where this difficulty is not found it is much to be doubted that the path is not the true one  I KNOW not however if living fame which is almost always false be not of more real moment to any writer or artist than posthu∣mous and eternal The latter will never buy him a great coat whereas the former heaps wealth and honours upon his happy head Living fame is sweet music to the ears tho one were even certain that it will die with us posthumous fame is unenjoyable by us is of no existence to us The false prescience of it affords high satisfaction to the vainglorious fool but the true prescience of it slightly af∣fects the great and the wise  IT hath already been observed that legiti∣mate celebrity is only to be found in the mouths of true judges who are sully as rare as good writers in so much that for fifty years after Milton's Comus was published nobody knew  its worth but Sir Henry Wotton The delay which true judges always adopt in pronouncing upon superior works hath also been stated The public in the mean time led by caprice or fashion bestow their applause which they ought carefully to hoard for real merit upon every gewgaw that comes in their way Hence the number of false reputations is almost in∣finite and in proportion to the true about one thousand to one  ANY person whodoubts if fame may ever be surreptitiously acquired need only to look into the title pages and cotemporary produc∣tions of a thousand works of the last and pre∣sent century In the first he will see sometimes the Twelfth edition of some poetical or other work which disgraces the human mind in the last he will observe the vain and transitory praises bestowed on it by writers of equal mi∣nuteness of intellect For one instance in a thousand of these facts Cotton's Virgil Tra∣vestie had Fourteen editions Milton's Poems hardly two and see the praises of the  matchless Orinda's  poems in Cowley and others Who was she Can there be a stronger illustration of  my position that false reputations actually exist Nay I know that I could from this very century muster up complete evidences of my position that they surpass the true in the pro∣portion of at least one thousand to one  I KNOW not how it is but it is certainly a more favourable symptom of a work to have enemies at first than admirers The ingeni∣ous author of the Book De l' Esprit a work in which great talents are exerted to support bad principles observes with truth that superiority is sure to create enemies The maxim of most people is that of the Ephesians  If any one ex∣cells among us let him go and excell elsewhere  M Helvetius hath aptly distinguished the esteem professed for writers of repute into two sorts an esteem of prejudice taken up upon the word of others and an esteem of sentiment The last I call the only foundation of true fame when it is the sentiment of a superior soul He marks Corneille as a writer whose esteem stands wholly upon prejudice and not sentiment  WHEN I mention popular fame as of no account in forming our judgement of the worth of a modern writer I do not mean to speak but of works out of the common class works that give new forms to human talents Works of themselves merely popular as novels and the like need not stand the test of their century before their fame may be called per∣manent A table of periods that must pass over different works before the stamp of last∣ing worth is put upon them might be curious Let us try it Suppose  Epic poetry  years  Dramatic poetry  years  History  years  Lyric poetry  years  Novels  years  Satiric poetry  years  Didactic poetry  years  Philosophy Natural  years  Moral  years  Criticism  years  Miscellanies  years  Panegyrics  hour  Pastoral poetry  minutes  THE reason of the short space allowed for the two last is their putrescent quality which makes it not safe to keep them long before they are eaten  LETTER LV  THE examination of the merits of Tasso's Gerusalemme shall now with your per∣mission be concluded The Fable with its Incidents hath been the subject of former dis∣cussion there now remain the Characters the Language the Particular Beauties All which shall be illustrated with as much brevity as possible  TO begin then with the Characters Tasso yields only to Homer for the variety of his persons Of their strength I cannot say so much most of the characters in the Gerusa∣lemme might certainly with much ease have permitted great heightening of additional co∣lours His warriors are by no means ill di∣versified Rinaldo is a most distinct personage from Tancred or Godfrey and the like may with justice be said of his other warriors But to be a little more explicit  GODFREY the chief commander is described as a character of the first value prudent with courage pious with generosity Perhaps it may be justly said that he is too perfect Homer the secretary of Nature draws no per∣fect characters Gravina with great ingenuity and truth observes that he almost alone of all writers paints the true manners and natural passions of men as they are As in life itself his virtuous characters have vice and the vi∣cious virtue A writer without experience thinks the more perfect his characters are in vice or virtue the more perfect they are in poetry The reverse is the truth Mixt cha∣racters are alone fit for the purposes of fable Milton knew this so well that he paints Satan himself as a dubious character  RINALDO perhaps the next in importance is an admirable character and new to epic poetry His extreme youth for if I remember right he is not eighteen at the period of the poem makes his part extremely interesting He is as different from Achilles as may be tho the general idea of his part in the poem is evidently hinted by Homer  TANCRED again is a most distinct personage from any other in the poem tho to deduce the marks of distinction might require more room than we can now spare  THE old warrior RAYMOND hath nothing to do with Nestor His old age makes his part fully as interesting as the youth of Rinaldo doth his  THE hermit PETER is a very fine and new personage and might have given occasion for admirable painting had Tasso but known how to avail himself of his fable to the utmost  DUDON GUELFO SUENO VAFRINO and others are all characters which at least atone for their want of strength by their variety And the like may justly be said even of the most inferior characters in the poem So much for the Christian persons  IF we pass to the Mahometan we shall find equal variety with much more strength Tasso seems to have thought that the Christian sys∣tem prevented any deep shades of discrimination  being thrown round a character while the Mahometan more indulgent to human frailty left ample scope for the natural man to shew himself In this view ALADIN SOLIMAN ALTAMORE ISMENO ARGANTES EMIRENO TISIPHERNES are all characters of as much strength as variety  THAT of Soliman the dethroned king of the Turks of Asia Minor combating against the Christians who had dethroned him is par∣ticularly strong new and interesting  THE part of ISMENO the Magician is no less strong and new to epic poetry Tasso hath in this and other parts of his poem admirably availed himself of the system of the middle ages and of chivalry to diversify his ma∣chinery Magic is certainly the most fit for the purposes of poetry of any supernatural assistance in the world Nothing is so delight∣ful to the imagination and the imagination is the sole judge of poetry  OF the  Female  characters on both sides I have already spoken but even in their con∣demnation must confess that they have a fine variety  THE LANGUAGE of the Gerusalemme hath in general all that exquisite melody which is the grand characteristic of the Italian tongue It hath not the simplicity of Homer because it was not written years ago and they who look for pears upon an elmtree will as San∣cho observes only find sore eyes Jesting apart nothing can well be more absurd and ridicu∣lous than to estimate one writer's language or other talents by comparison with those of ano∣ther Nature knows no comparisons Tasso's language may boldly be pronounced as perfect in its kind as that of Homer The first is a monarch in laced cloths the latter a monarch in plain Is the first less a king than the other  THE language of Tasso I allow to be figura∣tive but contend that it is with all its ex∣quisite figures much more correct and to me more pleasing than the elegant negligence of Ariosto The dress of the Gerusalemme is most artfully inwoven but it is inwoven with gold and with all its richness is yet as easy and becoming as the simple attire of some other poems Every reader must allow Milton's style to be much more inverted and figurative than  that of Tasso yet this hath never been laid to Milton's charge So mad is prejudice  THE stanza used by Tasso must be allowed melodious but its melody is uniform and uniformity the very worst fault versification can have is only to be avoided by using blank verse It is therefore to be wished that he had followed Trissino and not Ariosto in his ver∣sification The question with regard to blank verse and rime is reducible to this proposition Is pleasure the greater for being diversified  TASSO'S stanza hath disadvantages it ob∣liges the writer thrice to use the same rimes and to adopt tautology or unnecessary addi∣tion that his stanza may be completed with∣out passing to another subject It hath also ad∣vantages the set rimes of themselves often introduce thoughts that would not otherwise have arisen the completion of the stanza will often occasion more minute description one of the chief qualities of poetry  TO consider the language of Tasso at more length were inconsistent with my present pur∣pose It remains to point out a very few of the PARTICULAR BEAUTIES of the poem  IN Canto I this description of the young Rinaldo is delicate  Ma il fanciullo Rinaldo è sovra questi  E sovra quanti in mostra eran condutti  Dolcemente feroce alzar vedresti  La regal fronte e in lui mirar sol tutti  L' eta precorse e la speranza e presti  Pareano i fior quando n' usciro i frutti  S'el miri fulminar ne l' arme avvolto  Marte lo stimi Amor se scopre il volto  This simile is fine  Non e si grato a i caldi giorni il tuono  Che speranza di pioggia al mondo apporte  Come fu caro a le feroci genti  L' altero suon de bellici instrumenti  No description can surpass this of the army on their march  In tanto it Sol che da celesti campi  Va piu sempre avanzando e in alto ascende  L' arme percote e ne trae fiamme e lampi  Tremuli e chiari onde le viste offende  L' aria par di faville intorno avvampi  E quasi d' alto incendio in forma splende  E co fieri nitriti il suono accorda  Del ferro scosso e le campagne assordo  This maxim is amost just one  E l' aspettar del male e mal peggiore  Forse che non parebbe il mal presente  In the II Book this brief description of a timid lover well deserves all the admiration it hath gained  Brama assai poco spera a nulla chiede  In the next stanza save one this line  Le negligenze sue sono artifici  in one of the most happy antitheses ever written  Such lines as  Pur maggior sente il duol per chi non duolse  and  L'alte non temo e l' umili non sdegno  are worth whole pages of common poetry Sentimental axiomatic beauties are certainly the moft difficult of any of the smaller graces of poetry and ought to be highly valued Tasso is full of them Take two more from the same Canto  Gran fabbro di calunnie adorne in modi  Novi the sono accuse e pajon lodi  Ma verace valor benche negletto  E di se stesso a se fregio assai chiaro  In the III Canto this simile of the Christian army's joy upon the first sight of Jerusalem must not be omitted  Cosi di naviganti audace stuolo  Che nuova a ricercar estranio lido  E in mar dubbioso e sotto ignoto polo  Provi l' onde fallaci e'l vento infido  S'al fin discopre il disiato suolo  Lo saluta da lunge in lieto grido  E l'uno al l' altro il mostra e in tanto obblia  La noja e'l mal de la passata via  This description of the appearance of the Chris∣tian host from the towers of Jerusalem is won∣derful  Da la cittade in tanto un ch 'a le guarda  Sta d' alta torre e scopre i monti e i campi  Cola giuso la polve alzarsi guarda  Si che par the gran nube in aria stampi  Par che baleni quella nube e arda  Co  e di fiamme gravida e di lampi  Poi lo splendor de lucidi metalli  Scerne e distingue gli uomini e i cavalli  The sudden discovery of Clorinda in her com∣bat with Tancredo may with justice be ranked among the beauties of the poem  E le chiome dorate at vento sparse  Giovane donna in mezzo 'l campo apparse  And  Lampeggiar gli occhi e folgorar gli s  uardi  Dolci ne l'ira or che sarian nel riso  with others are strokes which the minute speak the master  THE death of Dudon is worthy of Tasso  Gli  occhi  apri tre volte e i dolci rai del celo  Cerco fruire e sovra un braccio alzars  E tre volte ricadde e fosco velo  Gli occhi adombro che stanchi al fin serarsi  Si dissolvono i membri e'l mortal gelo  Irrigiditi e di sudor gli ha sparsi  IN Canto IV Satan's speech is very elquent and it may here be observed of all the peeches in the Gerusalemme that they are of  he very first eloquence finely adapted to the characters and the occasions they may therefore  e justly regarded as some of the most striking beauties of the poem  THIS sentiment in Satan's speech i sublime and Miltonic  Ebbero i piu felici allor vittoria  Rimase a noi d' invitto ardir la glora  THE description of Armida is exquisitely beautiful The forté of Tasso is beauty that of Miltor sublimity  BUT  proceed even at this rate would pro∣long thi  letter too much you will therefore excuse me if I hasten to a close and enume∣rate any other particular graces of this poem as briefly as possible Were the whole beauties of the Gerusalemme narrated a vast volume and n  a letter ought to be the vehicle  TA  SO hath often made excellent use of an∣cientapophthegms as in this instance of a thou∣sand  I gradi primi  In meritar che conseguir desio  C V  He is likewise full of political wisdom take this a  iom for another instance of a thousand  Ce spesso avvien che ne maggior perigli  Soo i piu audaci gli ottimi consigli  THEE reproaches made by Tancred to Ar∣gante a  e most spirited and much in Homer's style  Fassi innanzi gridando Anima vile  Ch' arcor ne le vittorie infame sei c  C VI    This image in stanza of the same Canto is admirable  Gode Amor ch' e presente e tra se ride  IN Canto VII Tancred's adventure at the Castle of Armida is a fine instance of the ad∣vantages which the system of chivalry confers on poetry The battle of old Raimond with Argante is extremely interesting this compa∣rison of Argante almost disarmed and van∣quished is admirable  E par senza governo in mar turbato  Rotte vele e antenne eccelsa nave  From Canto VIII take this instance of a fine climax  Ch' aneor v'e chi sospetti e che di frodo  Goffredo accusi e chi le accuse approve  and from the next Canto this yet finer climax of the comparative kind He speaks of the soldan Soliman  Fiume ch' arbori insieme a case svella  Folgore the le torri abbatta ed arda  Terremoto che'l mondo empia d' orrore  Son picciole sembianze al suo furore  This couplet on the death of a young war∣rior is perhaps the most exquisitely beautiful to be found in poetry  L' alma lascio mesta  L'aure soavi de la vita e i giorni  De la tenera eta lieti e adorni  IN the XI Canto this circumstance descrip∣tive of the decline of a battle toward evening is very picturesque  E de le trombe istesse il suono langue  THE tears of Aladin in Canto XII almost equal those of Satan in Paradise Lost Book I The first are as strong and unexpected marks of extreme joy as the latter of uttermost des∣pair  Sollevo il re le palme e un lieto pianto  Giu per le crespe guancie a lui cadette c  The address to Night in the same Canto hath been justly admired  IN Book XIII the horrible sounds that issue from the inchanted forest are described with great strength of fancy  Esce all' or de la selva un suon repente  Che par rimbombo di terren che treme  E'l mormorar de gli austri in lui si sence  E'l pianto d' onda the fra scogli geme  Come rugge it leon fischia il serpente  Come urla il lupo e come l' orso freme  V'odi e v'odi le trombe e v'odi il tuono  Tanti e si fatti suoni esprime un suono  A variation of the same sound in Stan is alike dreadful to the imagination  E trarne un suon che flebile concento  Par d'umani sospiri e di singulti  E un non so che confuso instilla al core  Di pieta di spavento e di dolore  The gate of dreams in Canto XIV surpasses the two of Homer so poorly copied as usual by Virgil  Non lunge a l'auree porte ond' esce il Sole  E christalina porta in oriente  Che per costume innanzi aprir si suole  Che si dischiuda l'uscio al di nascente  Da questa escono i sogni i quai Dio vuole  Mander per grazia a pura e casta mente  Da questa or quel ch' al pic Buglion discende  L'ali dorate inverso lui distende  In Book XV the simile of the Dove's neck is exquisite but to quote similes were endless for  I know not one in the poem that is not super∣lative in its kind The description of the sail∣ing in Stan must delight every reader The comparisons in Stan are so fine as to demand particular remark in spite of the gene∣ral praise of Tasso's similes which I have just expressed  THE reproaches of Armida to Rinaldo in Canto XVI are of exquisite spirit  Vattene pur crudel con quella pace  Che lasci a me vattene iniquo omai  Me tosto ignudo spirto ombra seguace  Indivisibilmente a tergo avrai  Nova furia co serpi e con la face  Tanto t'agitero quanto t'amai c  THIS stroke tho minute speaks the master  Mille affetti in un guardo appajon misli  Cant XVIII  TASSO very often attains the moral axiomatic sublime here is another instance from Book XIX  Ov'e Signor la tua virtute antica  Disse il Soldan tutto crucciso all' ora  Tolgaci i regni pur sorte nemica  Che'l regal pregio e nostro e'n not dimora  and yet another instance from the same Canto  Prese i nemici han sol le mura e i tetti  E'l vulgo umil non la cittade han presa  Che nel capo del Re ne vostri petti  Ne le man vostre e la citta compresa  IN the Last Book the description of God∣frey's appearance before the decisive battle is wonderful  Vassene e tale e in vista il sommo Duce  Ch' altri certa vittoria indi presume  Novo favor del Cielo in lui riluce  E'l fa grande e augusto oltra il costume  Gli empie d'onor la faccia e vi riduce  Di giovinezza il bel purpureo lume  E ne l'atto de gli occhi e de le membra  Altro che mortal cosa egli rassembra  These minute touches are excellent  E di mezzo la tema esce il dilletto  E nel cadere egli ode  Dar gridendo i nemici al colpo lode  La via d'onor de la salute e via  NOTHING but the contracted limits of a Letter can excuse my making so diminutive a selection of beauties from a performance so rich  in them Indeed you will easily perceive that my aim thro the whole hath been rather to avoid noticing the innumerable beautiful pas∣sages that presented themselves than to search for them as a critic of less contracted province ought to do  LETTER LVI  LORD BACON in his Essays has given us what he calls  the true marshalling of the degrees of sovereign honour  in the following order  I Founders of states as Romulus c  II Lawgivers as Lycurgus Solon c  III Deliverers of their country  IV Enlargers and Defenders of their country and dominion  V Fathers of their country as just kings and rulers  THE names of several great men whom he classes under these heads I cannot approve for instance in the I he classes Cyrus Caesar Ot∣toman In the III Augustus Caesar Vespasian Aurelian Theodoric our Henry VII and Henry IV of France He seems to forget that he might have had from Greece immaculate examples of all his ranks of celebrity However the degrees cannot be objected to in any point but this that he ought to have placed his IId rank first for it is certainly a more difficult and a more glorious work to give laws to a  state than to found it The latter is a work of chance the former of labour and profoundest science of every kind  I HAVE often thought that it might be a matter of some curiosity not to say importance to attempt a similar scale of literary and scien∣tific fame The great branches of human art and science are if I remember right  I Na∣tural and Moral Philosophy  II Poetry  III History  IV Painting  V Music  VI Archi∣tecture  VII Sculpture  VIII Criticism and other lesser kinds of prose writing  There is an infinite number of more minute discrimina∣tions of science but upon examination we shall find that true celebrity has only sprung from one or other of these greater sources or their divisions The greater sources are formed from a numerous variety of springs upon any of which if a candidate's bark is properly launched he may be carried into the universal ocean of fame with swelling sails For example in Na∣tural Philosophy are contained Medicine Che∣mistry Botany Astronomy Geometry c eminence in any of which is a sure path to last∣ing reputation and the like is applicable to the other larger divisions  COMMON sense would lead us to think that the arts and sciences which are of most utility to man ought to be the highest objects of his esteem In this view to determine the propor∣tion of legitimate applause which a superla∣tive performance of any kind ought to have we would only need to class it according to its real utility Experience however is against this for a capital poet or painter hath always larger and more lasting fame than an inventor of the most useful art This is easily account∣ed for The inventor of an useful art is soon forgotten because any art that is merely use∣ful ceases almost with its invention to raise any admiration Its daily use of itself precludes all gratitude to the inventor Men in their ingratitude instead of wondering at the invent∣tion only wonder why the art was not disco∣vered before Besides the most useful art if of trivial use tho it may require the utmost power of mind to form the first idea of it yet can be improved by almost every body and these additional improvements totally stifle the first fame of the inventor Not to mention that the name of the artist never appears on products of useful art nor do their products  themselves last how then can his fame be preserved If it is it must be in writing the only immortal art we know but he who pre∣serves the fame of others in writing of any kind is certainly the more immediate heir of fame than those whose names he preserves Hence authors themselves are the surest pos∣sessors of celebrity and next to them those whom they condescend to applaud Hence we should know nothing of the ancient painters musicians and other artists did not we read of them in ancient volumes Hence Homer will always inherit more renown than the in∣ventor of the windmill tho I suspect a rigid philosopher would decide that the reputation of the latter ought to stand highest because he deserves best of mankind  IT is from facts then and not from theory that we should form an estimate of the degrees of scientific fame One who accurately weighs the estimation in which the respective arts and sciences are held by men of erudition who are their only genuine judges will find the scale to be much of this tenor  I Epic Poetry  II Dramatic Poetry  III Moral Philosophy  IV Natural Philosophy in general  V History  VI Lyric Poetry  VII Medicine  VIII Smaller epic poetry or tale writing  IX Architecture  X Painting  XI Music  XII Sculpture  XIII Fables  XIV Novels  XV Satiric Poetry  XVI Didactic Poetry  XVII Criticism and other small prose writ∣ing  XVIII Mathematics  XIX Astronomy  XX Geometry Chronology Geography  THE other arts if I rightly recollect are so minute that they form a galaxy of stars in which no difference of magnitude appears to the eye  LETTER LVII  NOTHING can be more just than your strictures on the folly and presumption of moss critics Criticism which is indeed only the lady's maid of ability like all those of that description is fond of aping her mis∣tress dresses herself in her cast cloths and looks upon herself as being as good as her lady Criti∣cism is at best only the pilot of Genius only knows shores already explored with the face of the coast and soundings when the captain commands the vessel upon an expedition to undiscovered isles this poor pilot condemns his rashness with bitter exclamations and despair of safety while the captain is obliged to take the helm himself attend to every rock and shoal and conduct his daring ship into a port from which he is to return with treasures yet unknown When he hath done this with a safety which valour always ensures you can∣not imagine how proud Mr Pilot is Like the  fly upon the coachwheel it was he and he alone whose cautious conduct guided the ves∣sel into harbour Now that he knows the road he can instruct others and does it with all the insolence of advice But his instructions are always of the timid kind and analogous to his own littleness of intellect He derives from the success of this expedition not arguments of enterprise for others of like adventure but chilling dissuasions and tales of danger inso∣much that very much owing to his cowardly information voyages to new latitudes of art are very rare and the man who attempts them with success may well be pronounced to have talents superior to those which found a state or shake a potent empire to its inmost found∣ations  CRITICISM may be defined to be That science by which we are taught to form pro∣per judgements of the merits and defects of the other arts and sciences I have called Cri∣ticism a science and not an art because it is theoretical and not practical because there can be no art where there is no room for inven∣tion because Criticism is merely a science  and rests solely upon knowlege in the points of which it treats and that knowlege if you will is not even a science  per se  but arises from the mental exertion of others yet does not ascend to analogy like other human sciences For instance were a critic to judge from ana∣logy that because the beginning of the Iliad is simple that of every epic poem ought to be so he would judge wrong for this reason that a man of genius his master would tell him that there ought to be no analogy in poetry and that the simplicity of Homer's beginning is a fault not a beauty for the great point of opening an epic poem is to raise the very ut∣most expectation and allowing it a beauty it is a beauty to be avoided by other writers because any appearance of imitation never fails to disgust a superior judge  CRITICISM if I mistake not originated with Aristotle who was as sond of subduing the mental world as his pupil Alexander was of conquering the habitable After that this Aris∣totle by dint of many a base trick and cavil to be found in Athenaeus Elian and other writers of antiquity had usurped a tyrannical power  over almost every branch of science he was like his mad disciple weeping for other worlds to vanquish After conquering the Earth in his Political and Moral works he had upon the airballoon of presumption to use a meta∣phor which smells a little of anachronism vi∣sited Mercury in his Topics the Moon in his Treatise on the Soul Venus in his Natural History Mars in his Treatise on Rhetoric Jupiter in his treatise on Heaven Saturn in his other works The planet of Poetry like Her∣schel's discovery was then rolling in new radiance thro the wastes of aether To it goes Mr Aristotle upon his air balloon and return∣ing tells us all about it To drop the allegory ere it grows stale to an impartial reader who is able to judge for himself it must be matter of infinite surprize how the authority of Aris∣totle should ever be any thing in poetry All he hath done is to give a parcel of metaphysical names his common trick to different points of poetry which points he draws without any invention or addition from Homer and Sophocles He then sits down with as much satisfaction as that Indian chief who gets up every morning before sunrise steps to the door of his cabin  marks with his finger the course the sun is to pursue in his day's journey which he always takes care shall be the usual one and then re∣turns in the glory of having given his direc∣tions to  the sun his brother  THE only thing Aristotle did in criticism was to give some names almost as unentelli∣gible as that  entelecheia  which hath cracked the brains of all his commentators to diffe∣rent articles He seems only to have strutted into the theatre of poetry to drop the curtain of obscurity over the scene of nature a de∣merit which the meanest menial belonging to the house could have had sufficient ability to incur the blame of as well as himself Perhaps you will think this censure of Aristotle severe but do not imagine it singular the awful shades of Vittorius Castelvetro Gravina the two last names in criticism superior to that of Aristotle rise around me in its defence  THIS mention of the earliest ancient critic might induce a review of the other critical writers of antiquity by which indeed we should be better enabled to judge of the nature of cri∣ticism  than by theoretic reasoning But to give this at proper length would require other bounds and deeper disquisition than the brief style of a letter will authorise The other cri∣tics of antiquity you know are Dionysius of Halicarnassus the author of the treatise under the name of Demetrius Phalereus Hermo∣genes Longinus among the Greeksand among the Latins  instar omnium  Quintilian the only critic who ever deserved the name To the three first may with justice be applied the noted distich  Turpe est dissciles habere nugas  Stultus et labor est ineptiarum  Of Longinus the fourth I shall only repeat the just verdict of an Italian critic of the first re∣pute namely that he wrote on the sublime in a total ignorance of what it was His work is in fact more applicable to the beautiful than to the sublime a sure proof that he knew not what he was writing about His praise of Neptune's horses leaping like so many fleas in a blanket is one instance of at least twenty of his false taste If it be sublime to make the god's ho  ses go so far at two or at three leaps  were it not far more so to describe them as leaping the whole space at once Can there be a sublime beyond which in its kind the most common mind may form conceptions Surely not Homer's idea is burlesque and an instance of the false sublime for this plain reason that it presents a risible and not a great image  TO Quintilian the highest reverence is due as the only ancient writer in prose who knew how to criticise with sound sense and integrity of mind  WHAT Quintilian is in prose Horace is in poetry His remarks for the very term of cri∣tical  precepts  which I was about to use implies derision are those of a master yet like those of all critics are to be strongly discussed by the reader's own judgement and in this view many of them will lie prostrate on the ground like so many false idols before the deity of truth This will always be the case with such criticisms as have no reasons alleged in their support which are ever fully as absurd in the eyes of a reader of science as the verdict of a judge would be ere he had lent an ear to the pleadings and recapitulated the cause  FROM the great rarity of good critics of an∣tiquity those of modern days ought to judge of the extreme difficulty of writing with such propriety as to secure the fame of future ages Just criticism itself is a dangerous province upon the very boundaries of the empire of science where because of its distance from the capital the renown is by no means proportioned to the greatness of ability and enterprize absolutely necessary to be exerted To form a proper cri∣tical estimation of any work the Iliad for in∣stance in all its parts would I must assert re∣quire talents double the size of the author's For if they are only equal the mind of the critic will be homogeneous with that of the poet he will consequently be capable of con∣ceiving nothing beyond the work and his performance will consist only of slight efforts of admiration and of blame not of such su∣perior critical disquisition as may improve the art of which he treats and which alone forms the essence of just criticism Suppose even that a critic should arise with twice the mental powers of Homer an event that will never happen suppose that his work had every per∣fection of criticism wide views profound re∣search  boundless treasures of erudition sup∣pose it displayed a mind that like a telescope could magnify distant worlds of genius and shew them to the common eye and at the same time with microscopic powers could examine the most minute particle of phrase what with all these supernatural attributes would be the proportion of his fame Very small The man of genius like the sun would dazzle nations while he a little planet of borrowed light would only glitter in obscurity  IN speaking of criticism I have avoided treat∣ing of systematic because the ancients knew no such thing it was left for the folly of the moderns to frame elements of universal criti∣cism An attempt than which nothing can be more absurd for if no critic hath yet arisen able fully to discuss one particular branch of this science what shall we say of him who boldly undertakes to examine and illustrate the whole  THE only work that could prove of real ad∣vantage in criticism would be a selection of all the remarks made by illustrious writers relative to this study accompanied with a modest ex∣planation  and commentary supported by ex∣amples Such a work would go further to be of genuine utility to the arts and sciences than any species of system tho digested by a critic of the most uncommon powers of mind  THE END
