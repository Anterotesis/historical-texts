EDITION  LONDON  Printed for  J PEELE  at  Locke  's Head in  PaternosterRow  MDCCXXIV  THE PREFACE  _THIS Translation was at first design'd as an Amusement without any Intention of making it publick the Translator not presuming to succeed in the Delicacy and Politeness of a Dialect peculiar to  Heroism  but as the Countess  D' Aunois  is the Author of this Piece and as most of her Works have had the good Fortune to meet with a favourable Reception he was induc'd to hope it might obtain the like Success Besides he wou'd not have ventur'd to deliver it to the Press had he not consulted with some judicious Persons who had read the Original in  French  and were pleas'd to honour it with their Sanction  It must be own'd at the same time that this is not a Literal Translation for tho' in  the  French  the Characters are well drawn and the Adventures agreeably related it was thought proper to retrench some surperfluous Repetitions which are frequently remark'd in Stories of this Nature written in that Language  As to the last Incident which is the Murder of  Leonida  succeeded by the Marriage of the Prince of  Carency  to another Lady that Circumstance with the Conclusion is entirely alter'd and it's presum'd that those who shall take the Trouble of comparing this with the Original will approve the Design since it seems unreasonable that  Leonida  who was a Perfection of Virtue and Beauty shou'd die a tragick Death and that the Prince of  Carency  who was so passionatly in Love with her shou'd after her cruel Fate conceive tender Sentiments for any other Lady a Character not becoming a Hero However if the Publick shou'd censure this Opinion the Translator must then submit to their unquestion'd Judgment and he humbly hopes that in Consideration this is his first Essay they will out of their Candor and good Nature pardon whatever Fault they find in the Attempt  THE Prince of  CARENCY  _THE Dutchess of  Lancaster  Daughter of Don  Pedro  King of  Castile  cou'd not without the greatest Concern see Don  John  's Accession to a Throne where she shou'd have been plac'd were not her Father's Misfortunes the unhappy Cause She very much sollicited the Duke her Husband to declare War against him which he was inclin'd to only waited for a favourable Occasion of making an Alliance  At this Juncture  Ferdinand  King of  Portugal  who often had Differences about Matters of Interest with the King of  Castile  gave the Duke of  Lancaster  an Opportunity of declaring his Intentions and sent to him desiring he wou'd join with him in the Conquest of their common Enemy The Duke without delay set out with a considerable Number of  Forces and took with him his Wife and Three Daughters These Ladies were very beautiful and the Youngest whose Name was  Catherine  being the only Daughter of his second Marriage had Pretensions to the Crown of  Spain  by Right of the Dutchess her Mother who was Heiress to that Dominion  The King of  Castile  finding that two such potent Enemies had declared against him apply'd to his Allies but more particularly to  Charles  the VIth King of  France  to whom he already owed many Obligations That Prince sent him Men and Money and Fortune declaring in his Favour he defeated the  English  and  Portuguese  in several Engagements The Sickness produc'd by the Climate was even more destructive to them than his Arms but having weighty Reasons to wish for Peace and knowing that the Duke of  Lancaster  had left the King of  Portugal  with some Disgust he sent the Prior of  Guadalupe  to him at  Bayonne  with considerable Offers and a Proposal of Marriage between his Son  Henry  Prince of  Asturias  and the Princess  Catherine  Daughter of the Duke which he represented to be the only Means of placing her on the Throne of  Spain  and at the same Time promis'd he shou'd have sufficient Reason to be satisfied with their Alliance  The Duke receiv'd with Pleasure this Overture of Peace being in all respects agreeable to his Interest and the King's Ambassadors perform'd the Ceremony of Marriage at  Bayonne  The Dutchess of  Lancaster  left  Biscay  to conduct her Daughter to  Medina del Campo  where the King receiv'd them with all the Magnificence imaginable She there presented him in the Name of the Duke her Husband with a Crown of Gold embellish'd with Jewels and told him with a majestick Air that since she had yielded to him the Right she had to the Kingdom of  Castile  it was but just he shou'd receive the Crown from the Duke her Lord The King answer'd that he only accepted of it with a Design of putting it on the Princess's Head as soon as his Son shou'd be of Age the young Prince being then but Ten Years old  The Duke of  Lancaster  remain'd all this Time at  Bayonne  tho' he passionately wish'd to see the King that he might endeavour to disingage him from the  French  Interest But the  Spanish  Monarch was too sensible of the Services he had receiv'd to have any wrong Proceedings with the King of  France  in such a Conjuncture therefore declined the Interview which the Duke desired and being indispos'd at  Burgos  took Leave of the Dutchess in that Place  Charles  the VIth being inform'd of the King of  Castile  's Conduct in what related to him thought himself so highly oblig'd that he chose  John  of  Bourbon  Count of  La March  his Kinsman as Ambassador to that Prince who had Orders to tell him that he shou'd ever embrace all Occasions of expressing his Gratitude  for the Value he was pleas'd to set on their Alliance The Count of  La March  was more capable than any of making known the Sentiments of his King being of the first Rank by his Birth and Fortune and by his great Qualities esteemed one of the finest Gentlemen of  France  After having acquitted himself of his Commission to the King of  Castile  he contracted a Friendship with Don  John  of  Velasco  who had married a  French  Lady Daughter of  Arnauld  of  Solier  She had for her Fortune the City of  Vilalpendo  which is one of the greatest in  Castile Velasco  by his Birth yielded to none but Princes of the Blood and his Merit was equally great Dona  Maria  his Wife preferr'd the  French  to all other Nations and inspired her Husband with the same Sentiments The Count of  La March  had already so great an Esteem for them that considering their vast Fortune was to be inherited by an only Daughter he resolv'd to propose a Marriage between her and  John  of  Bourbon  Prince of  Carency  the youngest of his Sons  Having meditated sometime on this Affair he visited Don  John  of  Velasco  and among other things told him He had three Sons that the King his Master had provided for the Two eldest and that the Youngest was still at his Disposal I am satisfy'd said he I shou'd have no reason to complain of his Fate were he destin'd to your Daughter Therefore if nothing opposes our Alliances I ask her for  him Your Proposal my Lord reply'd Don  John  of  Velasco  is so obliging that I have room to believe you sincerely wish it She is yet but Four Years old and the Prince your Son but Eight to what End can we dispose of the Destiny of Persons so little advanc'd in Years That ought not to be the least Obstacle said the Count we can sign the Contract of Marriage and I will send the Prince to you that you may form him for  Leonida  I don't question but you will like him he is a fine Youth and his Sense exceeds his Years You will be under no Difficulty interrupted Madam  Velasco  to persuade us into an Opinion of your Son's Merit it is sufficient that he is of your Illustrious Blood By what you are my Lord we judge what he may be and I thank Heaven that you have such favourable Dispositions for  Leonida  From her Birth I design'd her for one of my Country which is still dear to me and Don  John  sets no less a Value on it than I It is true reply'd Don  John  I have a great Veneration for the  French  and am very sensible of their Desert Judge then added he with what Pleasure we accept the Offer you make  Leonida  which is as much above our Hopes as her Merit This Conversation ended with all the Assurances of a perfect Friendship and the Articles of Marriage were drawn The Count of  La March  sent his to the King of  France  Don  John  carry'd his to the King of  Castile  and each consented to the Agreement  Don  John  made his Daughter's Fortune very considerable and the whole Court was pleas'd with the Match  Some time after the Count of  La March  preparing for his Return into  France  ask'd Don  John  of  Velasco  and his Lady whether they were willing he should send his Son to them No my Lord said they Let him remain in your Hands as a Token of our Love and Esteem the Education you will give him will make him an accomplish'd Prince and we hope you will not part with him till he has taken a perfect Impression of your great Example The Count promis'd he wou'd take all the Care imaginable to render his Son worthy of being ally'd to them then took his Leave  The King of  Castile  acquitted himself by the Count of the many Acknowledgments he owed  Charles  the VIth And writing to that Prince told him He cou'd not sufficiently praise the Merit and Conduct of his Ambassador The Count had not been long arriv'd at the Court of  France  when News came of the King of  Castile  's Death by a Fall from his Horse and his Son Don  Henry  sent an Account of it by Don  John  of  Velasco  The Count of  La March  took that Opportunity to do him all the Honours of a Court where he held a considerable Rank being nearly related to the King He presented the Prince of  Carency  to him whom he found to be a finer Youth than he imagin'd and from that Time conceiv'd  as great an Affection for him as if he had actually been happy in the Possession of  Leonida  The Peace and Tranquility which  France  then enjoy'd was soon after disturb'd by an Accident that happen'd to the King who being struck with Terror and Surprize at an Apparation fell into a Delirium which continued for some time  At this Juncture there was a very nice Negotiation to be carried on in  Spain  and the Dukes of  Berry  and  Burgundy  Uncles to the King having taken upon them the Administration of Affairs look'd on the Count of  La March  as the most capable Person to manage it The seeming Pretence of his Embassy was the usual Compliments to the King and the Infanta his Brother on their Marriage the one being lately marry'd to the Princess of  Lancaster  and the other to the young Countess of  Alburquerck  who was one of the richest Heiress's in  Europe  The Count of  La March  at his Arrival in  Spain  found Don  John  of  Velasco  in great Favour at Court the King having made him HighSteward of his Houshold and  Leonida  tho' not above Nine Years of Age was made one of the Maids of Honour to the Queen and bred up in the Palace  Madam  Velasco  was extremely pleas'd to see the Count again and her Satisfaction was so much the greater when he declar'd he had never seen any thing comparable to the Beauty of her Daughter He was so surpriz'd when he saw her that he cou'd not at first express  his Admiration her Hair was black and her Complexion as fair as possible It may be generally said of the  Spanish  Ladies that they have much finer Eyes than those of other Countries  Leonida  's were so full of Life and Spirit that one cou'd hardly withstand their Brightness yet they retain'd all that Air of Sweetness and Modesty which becomes her Sex so well In short the Beauties of her Mind were as perfect as the Charms of her Person and the Count of  La March  was so taken with her that had not his Glory and the King's Service call'd him back for  France  he willingly for her sake wou'd have stay'd longer at that Court Some time after his Return he was sent against the  English  over whom he had the good Fortune of getting so many Advantages as oblig'd them to wish for Peace which soon after was happily concluded with Proposals made by King  Richard  of a Marriage with  Isabella  of  France  but the Count of  La March  had not the Satisfaction to be at the Conclusion of it being forc'd by his Indisposition to retire to  Vandome  for some Relief and finding there that his Illness increas'd he did not doubt but he was very near taking Leave of the World therefore sent for the Prince of  Carency  and in a feeble Voice thus said to him The Condition I am in my dear Son wou'd give me great Concern had I not procured a Father for you in Don  John  of  Velasco  I am persuaded you will find no difference betwixt his  House and mine therefore perform the Promise I have made for you marry  Leonida  it is your dying Father's Command Tell your Brothers how dear they have been to me and that I recommend them to the Care of Heaven Do not render your selves unworthy of your Name Prefer Honour to Life and never omit what you owe to God or your King I had rather see you dead than survive a Disgrace owing to ill Conduct And as for you my dear Child it is a great Consolation to me in dying to believe your Inclinations will answer the Advice I now give you The young Prince filled with Grief fell at his Father's Feet and in spite of the Sobs which prevented his Utterance he endeavour'd to express himself in Terms so moving and generous that the Count of  La March  after so great a Satisfaction had little Regret in dying  The Year following  Sigismund  King of  Hungary  sent Ambassadors into  France  to desire  Charles  the Sixth to assist him with Troops being resolv'd to engage  Bajazet  Those Ministers gave the King an Account how that the Emperor  John Palealogus  had call'd that Enemy of the Christians to his Assistance against the Despote of  Bulgaria  and that  Bajazet  making use of the Advantages he had obtain'd wou'd not leave a Country where they had so imprudently let him enter The King concern'd at the Condition of  Sigismund  permitted most of the Youth of  France  to  make an Expedition in his Favour The young Count of  Nevers  who was then but Twenty Four Years old put himself at the Head of the young Noblemen who were very numerous among others  James  of  Bourbon  Count of  La March  highly distinguish'd himself The Prince of  Carency  his Brother made this Campaign with him and it is impossible to express the Joy he receiv'd at having so early an Opportunity of proving his Courage  The Particulars of this Expedition I refer to the Historian and shall only say there never was a more unhappy Campaign  Bajazet  having defeated the Christian Troops made a horrible Slaughter amongst the  French  and with much difficulty consented to Ransom Five or Six The Count of  La March  and his Brother were dangerously wounded and made Prisoners before  Nicopolis  The Prince of  Carency  was so afflicted at the Disaster of his Brother that in his Confinement he neither thought of the Danger of his own Wounds nor his lost Liberty When the Count of  La March  was recover'd and able to take Care of his and his Brother's Fortune he heard with mortal Displeasure the Resolution  Bajazet  had taken of putting all the Prisoners to the Sword and many were executed in that cruel manner When the Count of  Nevers  presenting his Head to receive the fatal Blow an old  Turk  famous for his Predictions cry'd out addressing himself to  Bajazet  Spare that young Prince for  he will destroy more Christians than all your Arms These Words preserv'd the Life they were going to deprive him of and the Event answer'd the Prophesy The Prince of  Carency  appear'd in his Turn and the deplorable State he was in at so tender an Age did no ways lessen that noble Air which distinguishes a Man of Birth and Courage from a common Person He was so perfectly handsom that  Bajazet  himself was under some Surprize and irresolute whether he shou'd put him to Death or be contented with his Ransom But after some Suspense the happy Destiny of the Prince triumph'd over the natural Barbarity of the other and Life was granted to him and his Brother upon Condition that a considerable Sum should be paid for their Ransom They writ to their Brother the Count of  Vandome  about it but while they were expecting an Answer from  France  they heard that the Count of  Nevers  had paid his and was preparing to return  One Night the Prince not having a mind to retire as he was walking very disconsolate on the Leads of the Tower where he was a Prisoner heard the Whistling of an Arrow which fell at his Feet He thought at first that some Person had a Design upon his Life but stooping to take it up perceiv'd a Letter tied to it which contain'd these Words written in  Lingua Franca  WHEN you appear'd before the Sultan loaded with Chains and in expectation of immediate Death did you think you cou'd move any thing but Pity You inspired at that Time more than you can imagine Love hid in your Eyes from a Captive render'd you a Conqueror Alas I saw you my dearest Prince and from that fatal Moment my Heart rebell'd against my Reason and forced from me numberless Sighs Methinks I see you I imagine I speak to you and all my Thoughts are of you I almost persuade my self that my Sentiments make a deep Impression on you and that our Souls already united flatter us with a perfect Felicity But alas that wou'd be too great a Happiness I dare not hope nor even desire it and shou'd sooner resolve upon Death than make these Sentiments known to you were not I persuaded you will never know who I am And far from taking any Advantage of my Weakness you will leave  Nicopolis  without seeing me Oh how unfortunate am I to find Consolation in being distant from the Object I love Consider this Extremity and if you cannot love me because Unknown at least do not refuse me your Pity I assure you it shall not prevail with me for I will soon put it in your Power to leave this Place I know your Ransom is not come with that of the Christian Prince and that he is preparing to go without you But do not afflict your self all Things are possible to Love Write to me to Morrow at the same Hour you receive this convey it by the same Messenger to the Foot of the Tower and learn betimes  to be secret Oh of all Mortals you are the most amiable Why have I seen you And why must I never see you more  The young Prince was not a little surpriz'd at what he read It seem'd to him so tender that he felt an extream Desire to see the Person who express'd so extraordinary a Passion for him and expected with the greatest Impatience the Time that he was to return an Answer He went as he used to do to the Top of the Tower and there made a Signal to the Messenger who was waiting for it then flung his Letter over which was written in these Terms  YOU are the first that ever made me sigh and the Sacrifice I offer you Madam of the first Motions of my Affection ought to give me some Place in your Favour I thought till now it was impossible to love what one never saw but the Uneasiness I feel and the ardent Desire I have to see you convince me you are already too dear for my Peace You render me the most unhappy of all Mankind if you deny me the Means of making my Retributions and entertaining you with my Transports Is it possible you can refuse me that Favour and at the same Time express so real a Passion for me What Madam can you consent I shou'd go from a Place where you are Oh rather leave me in my Prison since I am destin'd to wear your Chains  It was very late before the Prince retired in hopes the fair Unknown wou'd have sent him a second Letter the same way he receiv'd the First but was disappointed He went again the next Day upon the Tower where every Thing appear'd so silent that he had no room to flatter himself with what he so much wished Is it possible said he to his Brother who was Prisoner in the same Place with him and to whom he had told this Adventure Is it possible that the Person who writ this Letter sought only to divert her self at my Expence The oftner I read it the more reason I have to believe it sincere for I am persuaded there is a Smypathy in Hearts and therefore it is impossible to be so touch'd with what is counterfeited I am convinc'd of what you say reply'd the Count of  La March  and have my self experienc'd it which inclines me to think some other Reason obliges your Unknown not to write They pass'd the greatest part of the Day on the Top of the Tower entertaining each other after this manner till at last Night coming on without any hopes of a second Letter they retired The Prince return'd to his Chamber more melancholy than ever he had been but he was no sooner enter'd when he saw on a little Cedar Table a Toilet richly embroider'd with the Cypher of his Name woven in Gold The Work was perfectly fine it cover'd a Scymiter embellish'd with Jewels and a little Casket with golden Plates which he open'd with great precipitation and found  a Letter in it with a Sum that far exceeded his Ransom Here is what was wrote in the same Hand with the first  GO young Prince go far from a Place where my Passion may prove fatal to you Expect no more Letters from me This is the last you will receive Oh Heavens I am going to lose you and lose you for ever Why have not I power to follow you and render my Fortune inseparable from Yours I shall never more know your Sentiments You will forget me before it is possible for me to think of any Thing but you or cease to love you My Wishes shall ever attend you Pity me dear Prince since I must pass my sorrowful Life in bemoaning your Absence and my Misfortunes  The Prince of  Carency  admired the Proceedings of this generous Lady and his Gratitude was of such a Nature that the most transcendent Passion cou'd not have made a deeper Impression for when he consider'd he was to lose even the hopes of ever seeing her his violent Displeasure took place of all the Joy he ought to have felt at being in a Condition to pay his Ransom and return to  France  He bid one of his Guards go and tell the Count of  La March  that he wanted to speak with him but first took care to hide the magnificent Present he had just receiv'd  The Count came immediately to him and saw in his Eyes an extraordinary Air of Grief  At soon as they were alone the Prince flung his Arms about his Brother's Neck I want your Consolation dear Brother said he for I can receive it only from you See continued he showing him the Casket and Letter see what I owe to my Unknown and the Necessity she imposes on me to go away without seeing her Can any Thing be more great or noble Or can there be any Thing more soft or moving than the Words she imploys to bid me Adieu Oh how fatal will her Generosity be to me since I must even lose the Hopes of knowing who she is Here he was silent but after having meditated some Time She loves me said he and I burn with a more than equal Passion for her Why must I then leave  Nicopolis  In remaining here I may discover the Person to whom I am so highly indebted and if possible obtain the Happiness of seeing her For Love certainly is too good a Guide to forsake me in so fair a way The Count of  La March  who loved his Brother entirely was of Opinion that so magnificent a Present could not come from any one but a Person of the first Rank and that if he expos'd himself by making an Enquiry after her and penetrated into a Mystery that perhaps ought not to be disclos'd he might create himself Enemies which would be of a very dangerous Consequence in a Country where neither his Birth nor Merit could protect him and where the Name of a Christian was a Crime great enough to deserve Punishment Full of these  Thoughts he conjured his Brother in the most engaging Terms not to persist in a thing which lay under so many difficulties and represented to him that he might not only ruin himself but also be the Occasion of undoing the Person whom he so dearly loved Cou'd you ever forgive your self said he so Imprudent an Action The Lady loves you and were it possible for her to see you without Danger she wou'd have found means to favour your Request Therefore dear Brother let us go away with the Count of  Nevers  and embrace the favourable Disposition  Bajazet  is in at present His Capriciousness is ever to be fear'd and shou'd he change his Mind what wou'd become of us  Altho' the Count of  La March  's Arguments were very weighty the Prince was unwilling to submit to them having a strong Desire to find out by what means the Casket and Scymiter were convey'd into his Chamber He might easily imagine that one of his Guards had been bribed but as it was hard to discover the Person fearing he shou'd apply to the wrong Man he thought fit to be silent so took his leave of  Nicopolis  without knowing to whom he owed the highest Obligations  The Prince of  Carency  's Thoughts were constantly imploy'd on his generous Unknown and after his Arrival at the Court of  France  he found a secret Consolation in making her the Subject of his Discourse with the Counts of  La March  and  Vandome  who equally admired  a Passion so discrect and a Generosity without hopes of any Return Most Women that are in Love and make Presents said they have generally some View that tends to their private Satisfaction They endeavour to gain a Heart by Gratitude when they cannot conquer it by their Beauty But this Illustrious Foreigner said the Prince aim'd at nothing but procuring my Liberty since she even commanded me to quit the only Place where I cou'd have seen her He used to talk so often of her that the Count of  La March  feared he had some design of returning to  Misia  in order to discover who this Charmer was This made him entreat the Prince to write an obliging Letter to  Don John  of  Velasco  to put him in Mind of their Contract and assure him that he only expected his Commands to go for  Spain  The Prince having yielded to this Request Consider well said he to his Brother the Violence I do my self Shall I not be for ever unhappy in Marrying a Person for whom I have no Inclination You know very well that my Heart is fill'd with another Object It is true reply'd the Count you love an unknown Person who probably you will never see You do not even know her Name and perhaps she is no longer at  Nicopolis  Remember Brother that  Leonida  must crown your Felicity she is a great Fortune and very Beautiful How easy it is interrupted the Prince to advise others and imagine that a Heart ought always to sumbit to Reason But  alas it too often rebels and never suffers greater Torments than when it is forc'd into an Engagement by the Choice of others The Count of  La March  was doing all his Endeavours to inspire other Sentiments in his Brother which he hoped time might effect  The Prince of  Carency  continued extreamly melancholy till he receiv'd Letters from  Don John  wherein he assured him that his Daughter should never be dispos'd of to any one but himself but that being very young he desired the Marriage might be defer'd for some Years and advis'd him to imploy that time in Travelling This last Request gave no small Satisfaction to the Prince and as the Mareschal of  Boucicault  was going then to take Possession of  Genoa  which had surrender'd voluntarily to the King of  France  he embrac'd that Opportunity and went along with him to see that great City which passes for one of the finest in  Europe  As so many have given a Description of it I shall only pursue my Story  The Mareschal did not make a long stay at  Genoa  being commanded to go from thence to  Constantinople  with a fresh Army which became dreadful to  Bajazet  The Prince of  Carency  acquainted the Mareschal with the Design he had to accompany him in that Expedition but the latter being inform'd by the Counts of  La March  and  Vandome  of the Passion he had for an unknown Lady at  Nicopolis  and knowing that he was contracted to  Leonida  spoke to him in obliging Terms and represented  how much his Honour was concern'd in the Performance of his Promise to a Person of so considerable a Rank declaring at the same time that if he insisted on going with him he wou'd be forc'd to inform the Court of it These Reasons oblig'd the Prince to remain at  Genoa  in the Senator  Grimaldi  's House which had been offer'd to him in a most civil manner  One Night the Prince being more melancholy than usual went alone to the Mole which affords a fine Prospect and continued his Walk along the Shore till he insensibly found himself a great way from the City How unhappy is my Fate said he sighing I love and am belov'd but know not the Object of my Passion I can hear nothing concerning her Fortune nor give her any account of mine neither can I tell where to find the Lady whose Generosity has only serv'd to destroy my Peace He was lost in these melancholy Thoughts which were succeeded by others of a more tormenting Nature Why continued he did my Father sacrifice me to one whom I can never think agreeable since I adore another yet something tells me it is a Crime to disobey him Oh too Charming Unknown cry'd he were you but inform'd of the State I am in you wou'd recal me to you but what do I say That is a Happiness I dare not hope she paid my Ransom and commanded me to go it is possible she now loves me no more or strives to forget me and in either of the two I find but Subject to torment me  These different Reflections were perplexing the Prince when of a sudden Night came on with Rain and terrible Thunder which oblig'd him to direct his Course along the Wall of a Park where he found a Door that led him through a long Alley of OrangeTrees to a fine Pavilion here he observ'd a low Parlour the Pannels of which were gilded and the Roof finely painted As the Weather was excessive hot the Windows were open and there being Lights in the Room they gave him an Opportunity of seeing one of the most beautiful Persons in the World leaning on a Couch She seem'd asleep holding her Handkerchief in in her Hand a mourning Veil cover'd half her Neck and in this Posture she inspired both Love and Respect  The Prince stood some time at the Window and perceiving that every thing was silent went into the Parlour and kneeled by her the better to consider her Charms she appear'd pale and dejected and tho' asleep fetch'd deep Sighs which were follow'd by Tears that found a Passage thro' her clos'd EyeLids Who merits this Grief said he from so lovely a Creature Is it a Husband or a Lover you deplore He stop'd here and reflected on Chance that had conducted him to a Place so dangerous to his Liberty Then he continued Who can deserve those Sighs and Tears He looked with Admiration on the exact Proportion of her Features the Whiteness of her Hands and Arms the Beauty of her Neck and Colour of her Hair  His Eyes fix'd on so Divine an Object had already betray'd his Heart and he had not well recover'd the first Effects of his Surprize when the Lady wak'd who appear'd to be seiz'd with Fear which had like to have thrown her into a Swoon He attributed this to the Custom observ'd by the Ladies of  Italy  never to see Men in their own Apartments and thought she might be marry'd to some jealous Husband who finding a Man in his House so late might have some Suspicion which wou'd prove of a fatal Consequence to a Person for whom he had already conceiv'd so great a Passion I am extreamly concern'd Madam said he at the Disorder I have occasion'd but will retire with Regret from a Place which gives me so much Pleasure No no reply'd she my Dear Lover flinging her Arms about his Neck do not leave me I love you too well to be frighten'd tho' my Astonishment is great Be Witness of the Tears I shed for your Loss Ah dear Shade why did that terrible Engagement part us The Prince comprehended nothing of this obscure Speech yet thought himself happy in the Caresses he receiv'd and as the Name of a Lover pleas'd him that of a Shade surpriz'd and afflicted him The Sensibility he had shown on this Occasion might have convinc'd this fair Creature that he was not one of the other World but her Mind was so possess'd with his being dead that she spoke to him as to a Ghost which oblig'd him to say in a melancholy Accent I find Madam you  are deceiv'd in favour of some Resemblance and I protest were I dead and deplor'd by you I should think my self much happier than living and indifferent to you Alas I am not the Object of your Love Who then my Dear reply'd she with Precipitation What Sorrow could be equal to mine when I heard you were lost in returning from  Nicopolis  and that after having escaped the Fury of  Bajazet  it was your Misfortune to perish by your Ship's being blown up in an Engagement I own to you as I cou'd not believe you safe after so probable a Relation I gave my self up entirely to Grief Am I not very unhappy said I to have procured him his Liberty by paying his Ransom since it has forwarded his End But Oh Heavens Can any Joy or Surprize be equal to mine You are living my dearest Lover and your Eyes tell me you live for me read the Motions of mine they will convince you I live for you alone  These Words were so moving that the Prince cou'd not doubt any longer but this Lady who entertain'd him so tenderly was his Unknown of  Nicopolis  and this Opinion occasion'd a Joy which he cou'd neither conceal nor express but thought he shou'd die in Ecstasie at his Mistriss's Feet he look'd upon it as a Miracle of Love and Fortune that he shou'd unexpectedly find so surprizing a Beauty and he the Object of her Passion He fix'd his Lips on her Hand and kiss'd it with such Transports as he had never felt before Their  Discourse had no more Coherence but their Sighs express'd enough the State of their Souls The Night was far advanc'd when they were interrupted by one of the Lady's Women who came to give her Notice that her Father was just arriv'd We must part my dear Lover said she to the Prince return to  Genoa  and in Two Days come here again the same Way and at the same Hour I shall expect you in this Place Must I leave you Madam cry'd he with a dejected Air no I cannot resolve it Oh rather consent I shou'd remain here no Danger can alarm me where you are present What you ask said she is impossible Go my Lord all I can do for you is to give you my Picture which I sat for with a Design to send to you when you were in Confinement Here it is continued she taking it from off her Arm and tying it on his Let nothing in the World make you neglect so precious a Pledge of my Affection He threw himself on his Knees and wou'd have express'd his Acknowledgments to her but she left him fearing they shou'd be surpriz'd by her Father  She was hardly gone when the Prince abandon'd himself to all the Reflections that cou'd attend so extraordinary an Adventure Love cry'd he what have I done for thee to merit these Favours Is thy Goodness lasting and may not I apprehend that by some fatal Turn thou wilt destroy a Prosperity so little expected Day began to appear when  he perceiv'd he was still in the Parlour and fearing his staying longer there might be of some Prejudice to his adored Mistress he left the Place with Precipitation and return'd to the Senator  Grimaldi  's  As soon as he arriv'd he threw himself on his Bed but cou'd not sleep his Mind was so much imploy'd on the Thoughts of his Charming Unknown he had his Eyes continually fix'd on her Picture and fancy'd in her Absence he cou'd not have a Companion more dear He rose very early and the Senator hearing he was dress'd came to wait on him and wonder'd to see in his Countenance more Gaiety and Satisfaction than he had ever remark'd before My Lord said he with an obliging Air tho' I have been in the greatest Uneasiness about you not knowing what Accident might have detain'd you a whole Night alone in a Country where you have so few Acquaintance I no longer doubt but you have met with some agreeable Adventure for I find you so different from what you commonly are that I cannot help congratulating you on it The Prince tho' a little surpriz'd at what the Senator said to him having naturally so much Discretion as not to be capable of disclosing a Secret relating to Love excus'd himself as a Man of Gallantry wou'd do on such an Occasion and turn'd the Conversation on another Subject when there came one who interrupting them told the Senator that the Count of  Fiesque  was come to see  him He rose up and said to the Prince This Gentleman my Lord is of a Birth and Merit so distinguish'd that nothing can be added to the Sentiments of Esteem and Consideration we all have for him He has lost a Brother who was not inferior to him and who resembled you extreamly In finishing these Words he went to his own Apartment to receive the Count of  Fiesque  In a little Time after the Senator return'd with the Count and presented him to the Prince who received him after so polite a manner that he could have no reason to be displeas'd at his Visit and during their Conversation he look'd at the Prince with such Marks of Astonishment that he perceiv'd the Count had found in him the Resemblance which the Senator had just spoke of You look at me so attentively my Lord said the Prince that I shou'd think my self happy cou'd the Motive that engages you to it acquire me your Friendship That can be of no Service to a Person of your Distinction reply'd the Count with great Civility it is impossible to see you my Lord and not have a particular Esteem for you but I own that so perfect a Likeness affects me very much and that if I were not well assured of my Brother's Misfortune I shou'd have sufficient reason to doubt it in seeing you They afterwards turn'd their Discourse on other Things and parted with true Sentiments of Esteem for each other  The Prince of  Carency  pass'd the rest of that Day and the next in making Visits and as he design'd to stay at  Genoa  so long as wou'd be agreeable to his Unknown he was desirous of being acquainted with Persons of the greatest Consideration there The Senator  Grimaldi  approving his Design proposed to wait on him to  Brancaleon Doria  's who for his eminent Qualities was highly respected in the Republick It is not long said he since he return'd from  Sardinia  where he went to succour the King of  Sicily  whom on this Occasion he generously serv'd having acted contrary to his own Interest in regard to some particular Pretensions he had on that Kingdom The Senator gave the Prince a true Character of this Lord and added that Signora  Doria  his Lady who was a Person of great Merit was still at  Cagliari  If you please my Lord said he we will go and make him a Visit at his Country House I am sure you will be charm'd with the Beauty and Wit of his Daughter which may induce you to stay some Time in this Place for no Body can see her with Indifferency If she be so dangerous as you represent her I shou'd avoid seeing her said the Prince but I confess to you continued he smiling that the present situation of my Heart puts me out of her Power I left a Mistress at  Nicopolis  who entirely possesses my Thoughts I believe you my Lord reply'd the Senator smiling in his Turn but am a little afraid you were not so faithful last Night as you say in  the Remembrance of that amiable Stranger  As the Prince's Appointment was at Night he hasten'd to Signor  Doria  's that he might return home time enough to obey the Commands of his Unknown The Senator upon the Road told him the young Lady's Name was  Olympia  that she was passionately in love with the late Count of  La Vagne  and that the Houses of  Fiesque  and  Doria  had a mortal Aversion for each other which hinder'd her Father from consenting to their Marriage that altho' they were reduc'd to Despair yet the Obstacles they met with serv'd only to increase their Affection and that the Count thought by absenting himself from  Genoa  for some Time Signor  Doria  's Hatred might diminish but this Departure prov'd fatal to him for soon after News came of his Death  Olympia  far from concealing her Grief yielded her self up entirely to it which was fear'd she cou'd not outlive The Prince knowing by Experience that of all Passions Love had the greatest Empire he extreamly deplor'd the Fate of this fair Lady It is a great Unhappiness indeed said he to be separated for ever from the Person we love In finishing these Words they found themselves near the House they were going to so that he cou'd not help interrupting himself by praising it he had sufficient Knowledge in Architecture to know a well finish'd Building and in this he found Order Magnificence and a fine Situation  The Senator  Grimaldi  introduc'd the Prince to Signor  Doria  who gave him a Reception equal to his Rank and during their Conversation said he had never seen two Persons so like each other as the Prince and the Count of  La Vagne  This gave the Senator an Opportunity of desiring Signor  Doria  to present him to  Olympia  I cou'd hardly dispense with my not answering your Request reply'd he but that I am assur'd the Presence of the Prince will renew her Sorrow and only serve to inspire us with Pity He ask'd them to walk into a Garden joyning to his Apartment from whence they saw a vast number of Fountains playing whose Waters seem'd to pierce the Clouds and made by their Fall a pleasing Noise that inspired agreeable Thoughts from thence they went into a Labyrinth at the End of the Garden and through a little Alley of Jessamine he led them into a Grotto but was not a little surpriz'd to find his Daughter there who had retir'd to be more at Liberty to indulge those Ideas that were most pleasing to her  How astonish'd was the Prince when he saw  Olympia  and knew her to be the same Lady he found asleep in the Parlour and for whom he had already conceiv'd so great a Passion And how great was her Surprize when she saw her supposed Lover with her Father who seem'd to have no longer an Aversion for him She look'd with some Disorder at the Prince whose Confusion increas'd at the Thoughts of what he had just heard of the Count of  La Vagne  The Condition of their Souls was equally painted in their Eyes and the Senator  Grimaldi  began to penetrate into part of the Mystery when  Olympia  advancing towards her Father flung her self at his Feet Oh Sir said she Oh my Father Is it possible that you have at last pity'd our Sufferings and that you your self restore me my Lover At these Words the Prince cou'd no longer be unacquainted with his Misfortune he turn'd pale and trembling supported himself against a Pyramid of Pebbles but his Affliction being superior to his Courage he had like to have expired on the Place Signor  Doria  who was possess'd of nothing but  Olympia  's Error thought only of undeceiving her My dear Daughter said he the Prince of  Carency  whom you see here is a Prince of the House of  France  who does not know you nor did you ever see him before you are deceiv'd by the Resemblance there is between him and the Count of  La Vagne  I wish that too unfortunate Gentleman were not lost I wou'd no longer oppose your mutual Desires These Words were Daggers to her Heart she turn'd her Eyes on the Prince and fix'd them on him a great while without having Power to speak then changing her Colour fainted away and remain'd without any Sense of Life Signor  Doria  ran for help whilst the despairing Prince gathering new Strength from his Passion took her in his Arms and pressing her tenderly said in a low Voice interrupted with Sighs Have not I given you my Heart Madam  Cou'd the Count of  La Vagne  love you more than I Who cannot think myself undeserving of the Declaration you made me since I adore you with too much Ardour ever to change and I hope my Constancy will make some Impression on you While the Prince was speaking thus without being heard by  Olympia  Signor  Doria  and the Senator brought some Water from a Fountain that was near and having sprinkled a great deal on her she recover'd but finding her self in the Prince's Arms Ah leave me my Lord said she looking at him with a languishing Air and endeavouring to disengage her self you have deceiv'd me and interrupted my Grief but Death shall soon repair an Error which was not voluntary It is impossible to express the State the Prince was in who found himself distractedly in love without any hopes of a Return he heard his Mistress regret her Mistake and retract the Professions she had made him he secretly reproach'd himself for having been inconstant to his Unknown of  Nicopolis  but cou'd not be enough surpriz'd at the fatal Likeness between him and the Count of  Vagne  and the Similitude of their Fortunes they being in the Campaign of  Misia  both taken Prisoners by  Bajazet  sent to  Nicopolis  and ransom'd by their Mistrisses Every thing had so strange an Affinity that the Prince had Reason to think himself the most unhappy of all Mankind  Olympia  's Women being come they took her from the Prince who followed her into her Apartment she was laid on the Bed which he approach'd but as soon as she perceiv'd him she turn'd her Face from him and abandon'd her self to Grief What have I done Madam said he to deserve your Disdain You have render'd your self Mistress of my Heart and prevented me declaring my Sentiments to you by generously confessing yours in Terms so obliging that I was transported yet you now hate me you even deny me a Look and what ought to influence you in my Favour incurs your Displeasure  Olympia  made no Answer but with a feeble Hand push'd him from her Signor  Doria  cou'd not guess at the Meaning of this Discourse not knowing that the Prince of  Carency  had ever seen his Daughter The Senator  Grimaldi  suspected something of the Matter But thought it very extraordinary that so Infant a Passion shou'd already have the force of the greatest Engagement  The Illness of this divine Creature increas'd and the Prince's Despair was equal to it It is impossible to represent two Objects more worthy of Compassion Signor  Doria  distracted at his Daughter's Condition desired the Prince to retire because his Presence augmented her Pain and nothing less cou'd oblige the other to withdraw but before he retired he approach'd her in Opposition to what they cou'd say and kneeling by her Bed See Madam the Affliction I am in said he with broken  Sighs own at least that I deserve your Pity if you are cruel enough to deny me your Esteem Oh What have I done within these two Days to render me so odious I love you Madam to such a Degree that I am too well assured if you disdain me I cannot live but what am I saying If the Life of a Man you no longer seem to value is a Sacrifice worthy of you I shall prefer it as a happy Fate No my Lord said she endeavouring to answer him I wou'd not have you participate of my Ruin only wish that after the irreparable Loss I have receiv'd Death may terminate my Misfortunes I cannot help confessing the greatest Concern to see your Condition But as I am the Cause of it continu'd she it is just I alone shou'd suffer live my Lord live I conjure you forget my Weakness and let me dye In ending these Words she desired her Father and the Senator to carry the Prince away they told him that as it was  Olympia  's Request she ought not to be disobey'd Overcome by these Persuasions he left the Chamber but so disorder'd that they were forc'd to support him Signor  Doria  led them into a magnificent Apartment and excus'd his being oblig'd to leave them his Daughter's Illness requiring his Presence The Senator stay'd with the Prince who after being silent some time ask'd him if  Olympia  had been at  Nicopolis  and whether it was there she had paid the Count of  La Vagne  's Ransom He answer'd she had not been there but that the Count being taken Prisoner by  Bajazet  writ immediatly to his Mistress and his Brother desiring the latter to send him a Supply that some Affairs of Importance having at that time oblig'd the Count of  Fiesque  to go to  Rome Olmypia  fear'd his Absence might detain her Lover the longer in his Confinement and for that Reason sold some of her Jewels which she cou'd dispose of unknown to her Father and sent the Value of them into  Misia  for his Ransom that as he was coming back in a small Vessel it was attack'd by a Pyrate and whilst they were fighting the Powder took Fire and both Ships being blown up all those who were on board perish'd This News was brought to  Genoa  with so many Circumstances that there was no Room left to doubt it  The Prince heard this Relation with a great deal of Concern and after being a while without speaking he lifted up his Eyes to Heaven I can hardly believe said he there is a Mortal on Earth so wretched as I am Give me leave to tell you Sir that I was but Eight Years of Age when my Father sign'd a Contract of Marriage for me with  Don John  of  Velasco  's Daughter and on his DeathBed commanded me expressly to marry her some Years after I was taken Prisoner at  Nicopolis  where I was uncertain of Life or Death having Reason enough to fear the worst from  Bajazet  's unequal Temper who at last consented to receive my Ransom which I expected from  France  when a Lady who is yet unknown  to me made my Safety her care she wrote to me and sent me a Sum which much exceeded my Ransom and I must own her Wit and Generosity inspired me with so perfect a Passion that I believe I cou'd not have lov'd her more had I been acquainted with her Being thus set at Liberty I came to the Court of  France  where I made but a small Stay my Mind was continually distracted with the Idea of my Unknown which determin'd me to come here with the Mareschal Oh certainly it was the Fatality of my Stars that conducted me You have been Witness since my Arrival of my excessive Melancholy and as it was not in my Power to conceal it rather than trouble my Friends I endeavour'd to find out the most unfrequented Places to be more at Liberty to indulge it Here the Prince recited his Adventure with  Olympia  but the Thoughts of so cruel a Disappointment oblig'd him to be silent some time then recovering a little he continued his Discourse Oh Sir said he think how great is my Misfortune she whom I adore at  Genoa  is not the same I lov'd in  Misia  this charming Lady who flatter'd me with her Heart is now dying for another the Tragedy is before my Eyes I have by my Presence been an Addition to her Torment and it is probable she is this Minute expiring whilst I am reflecting on the Cruelty of my Fate He rose up and was going out with Precipitation but the Senator imagining he had a Mind to go to  Olympia  's Apartment stop'd him representing  that such a Behaviour wou'd highly displease her and that he ought rather by his Absence to procure some Ease to her disturbed Mind The Prince was obstinate but while they were disputing they heard the Cries of many Women which gave the last Alarm to the Prince Oh Heavens the Work is done said he flinging himself upon a Couch It is done She is now no more I have lost her for ever His Tears wou'd not permit him to continue his Complaint The Senator seeing the melancholy Condition he was in extreamly pitied him neglecting nothing that he thought cou'd allay his Grief which was too violent for any thing to mitigate  Some of the Servants came and told them  Olympia  had just breath'd her last in her Father's Arms It is hard to imagine the Agonies the Prince was in when he heard this dismal News and as he cou'd not doubt the Certainty of it it flung him into the deepest Despair Oh in what tender Language did he deplore her Loss and with what Compassion did he move those who saw him in his desolate State which time it self cou'd hardly alter He was going away without seeing Signor  Doria  which Proceeding might appear irregular did not one enter into his Afflictions for he look'd upon this unhappy Parent as the Cause of his Daughter's Death The Senator  Grimaldi  represented that Civility oblig'd him to condole with Signor  Doria  on the Loss he had just receiv'd Say rather reply'd the Prince with some Passion  that I ought to load him with Reproaches Barbarian as he was to oppose  Olympia  's Marriage with the Count of  La Vagne  which occasion'd the Cruelty of his Fate and has been the Source of my present Misfortune But my Lord said the Senator do you reflect that if she had been happy in the Count she wou'd not not have met with this unfortunate Adventure It is probable I might never have seen her said the Prince interrupting him or if I had I shou'd have known who she was and consequently not have taken her for my Unknown and my Gratitude for the one wou'd have protected me from the Charms of the other but alas it is no more in my power Let us go said he let us go Sir I have done my last His Tears and Affliction oblig'd him to be silent so they return'd to  Genoa  The Prince spoke but little on the Way and what he said only related to the Unhappiness of his Destiny Oh Night Oh fatal Night cry'd he what Pleasures did you not promise me This Minute I shou'd have been with that divine Creature according to her own Appointment Alas I shall see her no more her beautuous Eyes are shut for ever These Cruel Reflections made him very thoughtful and the Senator took that Opportunity to speak to him Cou'd you follow my Advice my Lord said he you wou'd endeavour to conquer two Passions which torment you at once for you love a Lady at  Nicopolis  whom it is likely you may never see  Olympia  you have seen and  lov'd her at first Sight she is now no more I must own that all the Circumstances of your Adventures are fatal but if you call Reason to your Assistance it will tell you that your Love is only due to  Leonida  she is destin'd for you and I am inform'd she is a Perfection of Virtue and Beauty Why then my Lord shou'd an Unknown or a Person that is no more deprive her of the Right she has to your Heart Why reply'd the Prince alas is it in my Power to love whom I please and forget two Objects that so entirely possess my Soul Love without consulting Duty takes Possession of our Inclinations he promises a thousand Pleasures and will sometimes grant small Favours But oh what Bitterness has been mix'd with those he has hitherto bestow'd on me The Senator perceiv'd by the Warmth of his Discourse that his Advice tho' very reasonable was ill tim'd therefore chose rather to pity the Prince than condemn those Sentiments which were too passionate and confus'd to be easily conquer'd  Olympia  's Death was generally lamented at  Genoa  being a Lady endow'd with many Excellencies The Count of  Fiesque  was extreamly touch'd at it Nothing cou'd give more Lustre to my Brother's Merit said he to his Friends than the Sacrifice of this fine Creature who despising Fortune that persecuted them wou'd not survive his Fate no less than so great an Example cou'd persuade me that a Passion does not expire with the loss of its Object  The Prince of  Carency  who spoke of her with great Concern soon made his Passion known to the World his Affliction was so deep that it appear'd in his Countenance and tho' he was deny'd to all Company yet he cou'd not refuse seeing Don  Fernand Benavidez  who was a Nobleman of  Andalusia  lately arriv'd from  Spain  and appear'd to be so fine a Gentleman that he easily gain'd the Friendship and Confidence of all who were acquainted with him He was at that Time distractedly in Love with  Leonida  whom he had often seen by the Means of his Sister  Casilda  who was also Maid of Honour to the Queen of  Spain  and was Mistress of so many agreeable Turns of Wit that  Leonida  prefer'd her to the rest of her Companions The perfect Friendship that was between these Ladies gave  Benavidez  an Opportunity of declaring to his Sister the Sentiments he had for  Leonida  which engaged her to speak often to the young Lady in his Favour but without the least appearance of Success As he knew she was contracted to the Prince of  Carency  who was then at  Genoa  he was seiz'd with so immoderate a Fit of Jealousy that he resolv'd to make that Voyage on purpose to see his Rival and sometime before his departure conversing with  Casilda  he said to her It is possible Sister I may discover some essential Defect in his Person or Humour which being made known to Don  John  of  Velasco  and  Leonida  will give them such an Aversion to him as may induce them to break a  Match that is not yet so far advanc'd as to destroy all my Hopes But if in this happy Rival I can spy no Fault I shall then apply to the only Remedy I have left he must die by my Hand or I by his and in either of the Two I shall think my self much happier than in my present Condition  Casilda  who lov'd her Brother entirely was surpriz'd and griev'd at so violent a Resolution You need not go to  Genoa  said she with a Design to discover any Imperfection in that Prince I have seen those who know him and have no Interest in speaking his Praise yet agree they never saw a more compleat Gentleman besides his high Birth greatly distinguishes him and Don  John  is a Man of too much Ambition not to promote a Match so glorious to his Family therefore depend upon it you will never prevail with him I advise you to make your Passion known to  Leonida  before you venture on any other Attempt The Affection she has for me may induce her to be favourable to you Love is capricious and there are no Measures to be taken with it Chance often decides the strongest Passions and if you can meet with that Sympathy which produces the Union of Hearts you need no other Means to make you happy Ah my dear Sister reply'd  Benavidez  do not flatter me I have not Resolution enough to follow your Advice if my Confession offends her she will forbid me ever seeing her more which must soon put a Period to my Life therefore I will try all other Ways before  I speak to her  Casilda  seeing her Brother so firmly resolv'd took no further Trouble to persuade him to the contrary  Thus he set out on his Journey and being arriv'd at  Genoa  went to visit the Prince He could not have recommended himself better than by speaking  Olympia  's Praise and deploring his Misfortune in her Loss but one Day in Conversation he said to him designedly You are not so much to be pity'd my Lord as you imagine since Donna  Leonida  is destin'd to be yours I believe continu'd he endeavouring to discover the Prince's Sentiments you may find such Perfections in her as will make you forget your other Disappointments These Words rather afflicted than consol'd the Prince You see my Grief reply'd he and as you are my Friend I must own to you the Engagement my Father has laid me under gives me a mortal Displeasure Were my Destiny in my own Power I wou'd entirely lay aside all thoughts of Marriage for at an Age that others are hardly capable of receiving the first Impressions of Love I have indur'd all its Torments without being bless'd with any of its Pleasures  Whilst the Prince was speaking  Benavidez  had time to divert the confus'd Thoughts which tormented him he extreamly rejoyc'd to hear the Prince declare the Indifferency he had for  Leonida  but that Joy was often interrupted with those Fears which generally attend great Passions Here he resum'd the Discourse and  express'd himself with so unaffected an Air that the Prince did not suspect the least Design I participate with you my Lord said he in your Trouble which is too well grounded The most agreeable Marriage Time may render indifferent Constant Society discovers many Failings and it is very rare to find any Happiness in an Alliance contracted without Inclination but these are not the only Reasons that induce me to pity you Here he stop'd and seem'd in a sort of Disorder as a Man who had said more than he wou'd willingly have done The Prince taking Notice of it I penetrate your Thoughts Don  Fernand  said he why shou'd you conceal any Thing from one who has no Reserve to you pray tell me what you know of  Leonida  I know nothing prejudicial to her Honour reply'd  Benavidez  but I must own my Lord I am so particularly acquainted with her that I fear you will be very unhappy if ever she is yours her Humour is inconstant and suspicious the Haughtiness of her Mind is insupportable to all that know her and in short she is become so ridiculous at Court that she wou'd meet with many Affronts were it not for the Rank her Father holds there  Oh Heavens what do you tell me cry'd the too credulous Prince is it possible that all those who spoke of her have endeavour'd to deceive me in saying she was the most accomplish'd Creature they had ever seen They only said it to soften your Grief my Lord  reply'd  Benavidez  with an indifferent Air and I think my self very imprudent for having treated her with so much freedom You know me not my dear  Benavidez  said the Prince taking him in his Arms do you think me capable of receiving ill so generous a Confidence No I protest I am extreamly oblig'd to you and what grieves me most is that I cannot make the right use of it my Fate is decreed and there is no declining it What my Lord do you then intend to marry her reply'd immediately  Benavidez  Alas what can I do said the Prince it was my Father's last Command and I will not deserve the Reproach of having disobey'd him For my part cry'd  Benavidez  I shou'd for ever upbraid my self if I suffer'd you to proceed any farther in this Affair as I profess my self one of your most zealous Friends I will sooner give my Life than see you unhappy You carry your Friendship too far generous  Benavidez  reply'd the Prince it is not reasonable that my Indifference for  Leonida  shou'd make her Relations your Enemies therefore I am resolv'd to offer my self a Victim to my Father's Will without thinking any more of what I may have to fear in the Society of a Person so disagreeable  Benavidez  began to apprehend that if he continued to oppose the Prince in his Design it might give him some Cause of Suspicion so took his Leave in the most violent Despair How unfortunate am I cry'd he what must I resolve on I adore  Leonida  and can never flatter  my self with a Return whilst the Prince of  Carency  who loves her not is going to possess all her Charms No I cannot bear the Thoughts of it I must sacrifice this happy Rival before he sees his Mistress or lose my Life He pronounced these Words with a menacing Air and like a Man almost distracted was tempted more than once to return and stab the Prince but after having been some Time in this Disorder his Spirits became more calm What said he can I with Justice hate him since he is my Rival against his Will Ought not I rather to open my Breast to him implore his Pity and conjure him to yield  Leonida  to me No this Expedient will never do cry'd he again I cannot repose this Confidence in him What wou'd he think of me shou'd I confess a Passion for her after having describ'd her as a Person undeserving of him and advised him against her he must then believe me the greatest of Villains But let him think what he will of my Sentiments I had rather submit to every Thing than be depriv'd of the Object I love I shall tell him the Reasons which induc'd me to speak of her as I did The Force of my Passion will excuse me to a Person who is so well acquainted with the Effects of Love and has no other Motive to marry than Obedience But alas my Happiness is not in his Power  Leonida  's Father is the first Grandee of  Spain  Constable of  Castile  and the King's Favourite and suppose all his Engagements with the Prince were intirely  broke off he wou'd design a Match for his Daughter much more considerable than I could pretend to be These melancholy Reflections serv'd to persuade him that to sacrifice the Prince or implore his Aid wou'd be equally of no Effect and that he ought to find other Means to procure himself the only Thing on which depended his Felicity  Benavidez  stay'd some Time at  Genoa  and the Prince proposing to go on his Travels in hopes that changing of Places might divert his Grief ask'd him whether he was willing to go along with him He accepted of the Offer and the Senator  Grimaldi  who was persuaded that the Prince's Affliction was exceeding great resolv'd also to accompany him to  Rome  being generously inclin'd to partake of his Troubles since he cou'd no ways remove them He had a mighty Respect and Friendship for the Prince whose Merit and distinguishing Qualities made so strong an Impression on those who knew him that they cou'd not help admiring him  Benavidez  had now laid a Design whereby he expected to break the Prince's Measures and in order to succeed he wrote to his Sister that Chance had conducted him to  Genoa  where the Prince of  Carency  was deploring the Death of  Olympia Doria  with whom at first sight he had fallen passionately in Love Upon this he gave an agreeable Turn to his Letter which render'd it very diverting but so ridiculously characteriz'd the Prince that he wou'd have had all the reason imaginable to resent it had he known any Thing of the Matter  Benavidez  desired his Sister by a private Note not to neglect showing his Letter to  Leonida  which she as exactly perform'd as he cou'd have wish'd One Day as they were both taking the Air  Casilda  told her she had receiv'd a Letter from her Brother wherein her Name was often mention'd He has been some Time absent said  Leonida  does he not talk of returning soon He is at present imploy'd in your Service reply'd  Casilda  maliciously since he is consoling a Prince for whom you ought to be concern'd and if you will promise me to be secret I can tell you something in Confidence that may be of Use to you I know you are always diverting your self with one Raillery or other said  Leonida  who really thought it was nothing but a Jest nevertheless I promise you to be secret if that will do Take this Letter then and read it reply'd  Casilda  you will see I am in earnest and that the Prince of  Carency  in giving you his Heart will present you with nothing new  Leonida  read with some kind of Eagerness what  Benavidez  had written to his Sister then looking on her smiling I must confess said she I am no ways alarm'd to hear of the Prince's Passion for a fine Woman and am vain enough to flatter my self that when he sees me I shall have it in my Power to deface the Impression she might have made on his Heart I am persuaded a dead Rival can prove no ways dangerous and provided I have no other to fear I dare be assur'd I shall live in perfect Tranquility  Casilda  was extreamly confus'd to see in what manner  Leonida  had taken a thing that she imagin'd wou'd have vex'd her but conceal'd her Disorder You are in the right my dearest Companion said she embracing her to promise your self every Thing from your incomparable Charms they have Power enough to eclipse the strongest Ideas of any Love but that which you inspire  Leonida  whose Modesty was parallel to her Beauty wou'd hear no more of these Encomiums so interrupted her desiring she wou'd chuse some other Subject for their Conversation I wou'd willingly oblige you reply'd  Casilda  did I not think my self bound in Friendship to represent to you the Advantages you have over the Prince of  Carency  and how unfortunate you will be if you marry him Reflect a little on what my Brother writes Can any Thing be equal to the Weakness of a Man who falls distractedly in Love with a Person at first sight knowing at the same Time he was destin'd to be Yours It is easy to judge of his Character by such a Proceeding indeed pursu'd she sighing it grieves me that you shou'd be promis'd to One who so little deserves you I am sensible of the Marks you give me of your Affection my dearest  Casilda  reply'd  Leonida  and am not less touch'd at the Misfortune you have made me foresee were I Mistress of my Destiny I cou'd make a Choice different from that which is allotted me I wish my Father wou'd consult my Sentiments on that Subject  and not so entirely follow his own but let what will happen I am resolv'd to obey him and will not even endeavour to make him change his Resolution If I am unhappy in a Person I do not like it shall only affect my self being determin'd never to give him any Reason to complain of my Conduct  Casilda  made no Objection to so reasonable a Disposition fearing  Leonida  shou'd perceive some underhand Design but thought she had made a good Progress for the first Attempt in discovering from her own Mouth that she not only look'd on the Prince with Indifference but had already conceiv'd an Aversion for him which flatter'd her that Time wou'd procure some other Opportunity of practising such Artifices as she was capable of framing  The Prince at this Time was at  Rome  and being inform'd of the Emperor  Vendisla  's Journey to  Rheims  where the King of  France  was preparing to give him a Reception believ'd on this Occasion the Court wou'd appear in its greatest Lustre and that it might be taken ill if he were not present therefore propos'd that Tour to the Senator and Don  Fernand  who readily consented to accompany him to the Solemnity  Upon his Arrival at  Paris  he order'd a fine Equipage to be made and from thence went to  Rheims  The pretext of the Emperor's coming there was a Treaty of Marriage between the Duke of  Orleans  's Daughter and the Marquis of  Brandenburg  tho' some ascrib'd it to  other Motives The young Princes and Lords who attended the Emperor and the King of  France  to this Meeting left them to treat by themselves and pass'd their Time in Pleasures agreeable to their Age as Tournaments running at the Rings and Balls which daily succeeded each other with so much Order and Magnificence that all the Nobility of  France  endeavoured to be Spectators of this triumphant Season  The Prince of  Carency  amidst these Pleasures was extremely melancholy his Unknown of  Nicopolis  the Death of  Olympia  and his Aversion for  Leonida  were equally a Torment to him and  Benavidez  entertain'd him constantly in all these Dispositions  Soon after the Emperor and the King of  France  having agreed on what they came to treat of took leave of each other the latter being then inform'd that a Rebellion had broke out in  England  sent over a Number of Troops under the Command of the Count of  La March  The Count of  Vandome  and the Prince of  Carency  who were desirous of acquiring Glory embrac'd that Occasion and accompany'd their Brother in this Expedition The Senator  Grimaldi  took his Leave here of the Prince and return'd to  Genoa  but Don  Fernand Benavidez  went over with him for  England  where they met with so little Success that they were soon forc'd back At their arrival at the Court of  France  the Prince of  Carency  perceiving that the Princes of the Blood his near Relations  were in Contest relating to the Regency thought he cou'd not well remain there without engaging in their Quarrel so resolv'd to return to  Rome  and having told his Design to  Benavidez  who was willing to go with him took leave of the Court and set out on his Journey  The mean while  Leonida  and  Casilda  were made Ladies of Honour which allow'd them more Liberty than before and as they waited on the Queen whenever she went abroad many People who had never seen  Leonida  were so charm'd with her that she soon pass'd in  Spain  for a surprizing Beauty This Opinion did no ways intitle her to the Friendship of her Sex for tho' the Ladies at Court cou'd not disown her extraordinary Merit yet it invited them all to envy her  Casilda  used to talk very much to her in favour of her Brother saying Things at the same Time entirely to the Prince of  Carency  's Disadvantage It is true that what she cou'd say in behalf of the one made but a slight Impression on  Leonida  but then the ill Character she gave of the other perplex'd her extremely she began to think her self very unhappy in the Choice her Father had made for her of a Prince who had no other Recommendation but his Birth I cannot imagine said she one Day to  Casilda  why the World will attribute so many fine Qualities to a Man who is far from possessing the least of them and how those who have seen him can study to deceive me in his Favour That is the Character  of the Age reply'd  Casilda  the Prince is consider'd as a Man of an eminent Rank and great Fortune and such Persons as know he is contracted to you will certainly set him off to the greatest Advantage I am even surpriz'd at the Sincerity of my Brother who I fear will have Cause to repent hereafter of what he has done It is possible you may one Day tell the Prince what he writ to me about him and your Disdain will be his only Reward for the Intention he had to serve you Ah know me better cry'd  Leonida  and do not think me guilty of Ingratitude I am too sensible of my Obligation to your Brother ever to expose him to the Prince's Resentment and I declare to you my dear  Casilda  that after having consulted my Inclinations I am at last resolv'd to make good use of his Advice I will throw my self at my Father's Feet and represent to him my Aversion for the Prince in so feeling a manner that my Prayers and Tears shall prevent his concluding our Marriage  Casilda  was extreamly pleas'd at this Declaration and encourag'd  Leonida  in that Design not omitting to put her in mind of the Misfortunes which attend an Alliance made out of political Motives and not to give her Time to change a Resolution so agreeable she conducted her to Don  John  's Apartment and there left her in order to go and write to  Benavidez  Her Letter was in these Terms  REturn dear Brother return every Thing answers your Desires  Leonida  believes the Picture you sent her of the Prince is a true Copy of the Original and that Love has no Share in what you write Oh Heavens how happy shou'd I be had I as much Reason to be contented with my Destiny as you have with yours But the ungrateful  Henriquez  has relapsed into his first Passion in spite of all the Care I took to prevent it he has seen Donna  Blanca  consider then the State I am in I impatiently wait your Return to tell you my Trouble and beg your Consolation since nothing else is capable of giving me any  Benavidez  was arriv'd at  Rome  when he receiv'd this Letter which gave him inexpressible Joy  Casilda  's Affliction had not Power to interrupt the Pleasure he had conceiv'd at the Thoughts of  Leonida  's being dispos'd to favour his Passion He went to visit the Prince who no sooner saw him but perceiv'd so great an alteration in his Countenance that he could not help inquiring into the Cause  Benavidez  said he you must have receiv'd some agreeble News for your Eyes seem to own it I will not keep any Thing a Secret from you my Lord reply'd he I come rather to make you my Confident Speak then with an entire Confidence said the Prince you cannot do me a greater Pleasure I am in Love continu'd  Benavidez  and have some Reason to flatter my self with an obliging Return You must know that my Mistress having unjustly suspected my  Constancy by the false Insinuations of some of my Enemies wou'd not so much as hear me in my Justification but forbad me her Presence and the Care she took to avoid me had like with my Life to have ended my Misfortunes I left the Court very disconsolate and retired to my Country Seat where I found that Solitude only augmented my Grief therefore to remedy this Ill I resolv'd to Travel so took leave of my Sister the most distracted of all Mankind She extremely pity'd my Condition and promis'd in my Absence to use her utmost Endeavours to make my Peace which at last she has done with the most obliging Circumstances My Mistress recals me and now impatiently desires my Return but in spite of my Passion I am sensibly affected my Lord with being oblig'd to leave you for I have felt so real a Satisfaction in your Company that I cou'd wish I had never known you or that I were never to part from you  The Prince at these Words embrac'd him with great Tenderness which shew'd that his Departure touch'd him to the Heart I was in hopes said he you wou'd have gone with me to the Court of  Navarre  where my Brother is to marry the King's Daughter and has desired me to attend the Ceremony What Violence must I do to my secret Pain in a Place where nothing but Pleasure will be thought of I cannot abandon my self to my Melancholy neither do I believe I can be so good a Counterfeit as to conceal it from Persons so discerning  and if I speak of my torment to my Brother I fear he will not think it worth his Concern Judge then my dear  Benavidez  what Consolation your Company wou'd be to me since you not only deplor'd my Fate but soften'd my Misfortunes and in all Respects have appear'd the best of Friends Oh how necessary wou'd your Assistance be in this Juncture and how extremely shall I regret your Absence But these Considerations are too weak to oppose what your adorable Mistress commands and your Inclinations invite you to obey Go then continu'd he sighing go and taste those Pleasures which are prepar'd for you He finish'd these Words with so dejected an Air that it wou'd have created Pity in any one but a Rival for when once we adore an Object we conceive an Aversion for those who are Obstacles to our Happiness and have no longer Power to be just even to the Merit of any other Votary  The Nuptials of the young Princess of  Navarre  were celebrated with a Pomp and Magnificence equal to the Occasion all manner of Diversions were given at the King's Expence to make that Solemnity as fine as possible but in the midst of these Pleasures the Prince appear'd lost in a Distraction of Mind which was too great for any thing to alleviate however he affected a Gaiety which he was so little us'd to that the Counterfeit was easily perceiv'd What makes you so very melancholy Brother said the Count of  La March  to him one Day  I see the Violence you do your Inclinations when you are in the best of Company It wou'd be better for you to break off with your Friends and give your self up entirely to your own Humour You make me an indifferent Return interrupted the Prince for the Care I have taken to conceal my  Chagrin  but I protest to you that it is of such a Nature as cannot be conquer'd therefore dear Brother I will take your Advice and in banishing my self from a Place where my Presence is disagreeable avoid Reproaches which very much affect me These Words made the Count of  La March  sensible that to rally him upon his Grief was a certain Way to augment it and as he lov'd the Prince dearly and found many shining Qualities in him he embrac'd him with the greatest Marks of Affection What dear Brother said he in an obliging manner is it possible you shou'd take a Thing so seriously which was only design'd as a Jest Do you think that for so slight a Matter your Company cou'd be disagreeable to me No do your self more Justice and never suspect mine So unfortunate a Man as I am reply'd the Prince has ever room to fear and if you knew what it is never to have seen one Mistress and to lose another as soon as you had conceiv'd a Passion for her you wou'd not add to my Pain The Count cou'd not help smiling at the Fantasticalness of these different Adventures You do not pity me then said the Prince nor comprehend how one can suffer so much with so  little reason you think it ridiculous in me to sigh for a Person I do not know and for one that is now no more but Oh these Two Things are the principal Cause of my Melancholy The Count of  La March  pity'd him extremely and omitted nothing afterwards that cou'd console him  By this Time  Benavidez  was arriv'd at  Madrid  where he found a great Alteration the King being dead and the Care of his Son Don  John  's Education who was then but Twenty Two Months old left to Don  Diego Lopez  of  Cuniga  and Don  John  of  Velasco  which Mark of the King's Esteem for these two Lords in reposing so great a Trust in them gave a mighty Addition to their Fortunes and Power The Court was very much divided at that Juncture the Infanta Don  Fernand  Brother to the late King having a considerable Party was offer'd the Crown but he generously declin'd it and had the young Prince proclaim'd King which was perform'd to the great Satisfaction of the Queen who after her Son was settled on the Throne retired to  Villa Real  for the Benefit of the Air and agreeable Situation of the Place  It was here that  Leonora  Wife to Don  Diego Lopez  introduc'd her self into the Queen's Favour and had so great an Influence over her that whatever she ask'd was immediately granted she had a great deal of Wit but of so dangerous a Nature that those who sincerely espous'd the Queen's Interest began to lose their Credit by her malicious Insinuations  which made them in a little time conceive as great an Aversion for the Sovereign as for the Favourite  Thus was the State of Affairs when  Benavidez  came to  Villa Real  where he staid some Time before he cou'd find an Opportunity to speak with his Sister because during the first Days of Mourning it is the Custom in  Spain  not to admit any Person into the Palace except the Family but as soon as the Queen cou'd be seen he was introduc'd into her Apartment where he found  Leonida  and  Casilda  It is impossible to express the different Agitations he was in at the Sight of  Leonida  who might have discover'd his secret Thoughts had she perceiv'd his Disorder  After having satisfy'd the Queen in some Particulars relating to his Travels he hasten'd to his Sister's Apartment but was agreeably surpriz'd when passing through a Gallery of Paintings where  Casilda  had designedly invited  Leonida  to walk he met them and saluted  Leonida  with much Respect Give me leave Madam said he to acquit my self of the Commission I receiv'd from the Prince of  Carency  who charg'd me to assure you that he will be soon here in order to conclude a Marriage to which you are destin'd tho' unknown to each other It is an equal Misfortune to us both reply'd  Leonida  with a dejected Air and the Particulars you writ to  Casilda  relating to the Character of that Prince have so tormented me that I have omited nothing ever since  which I thought cou'd persuade my Father to change his Resolution but he so strictly regards his Word that hitherto my Prayers and Tears have had no Power to move him  Benavidez  fetch'd a deep Sigh and after a Moment's Silence The Prince desired me Madam said he to send your Picture to him and I must confess it wou'd be a Trouble to me to see him receive that Favour had he not a Prospect of being happy in the Possession of the Original I cannot dispose of my Picture interrupted  Leonida  without my Mother's leave therefore it depends on you to ask it of her but in my Opinion it is entirely unnecessary The Prince will see me too soon for his Peace or mine I am not amiable enough to efface the Objects which possess his Heart but I will try by my Obedience to deserve his Esteem Madam said  Benavidez  since you consent to it I will tell Madam  Velasco  that it is the Prince your Lover's Request Speak to whom you please of it reply'd  Leonida  with an Air of Contempt but do not call so fantastical a Person my Lover I can never like a Man that falls in love with all he sees and even with those he never saw  As she had finish'd these Words Madam  Velasco  who was going to the Queen's Apartment enter'd the Gallery She knew  Benavidez  had been a great while with the Prince of  Carency  which made her suppose there was an intimate Friendship between them and as her Concern for a Prince who was contracted to her Daughter  cou'd not indifferently affect her she immediately enquired after his Health and express'd a great Impatience to see him in  Spain Benavidez  told her he had left  Rome  and was going to the Court of  Navarre  to be at the Solemnity of his Brother the Count of  La March  's Nuptials with the Princess  Beatricia  Daughter to the King that the Prince passionately wish'd for  Leonida  's Picture which he had promis'd to ask for him and therefore address'd her for that Favour Madam  Velasco  was very much pleas'd at the Zeal  Benavidez  seem'd to have for his Friend and told him She wou'd do any Thing that might be agreeable to the Prince that her Daughter shou'd sit for her Picture and desired he wou'd take Care to send it to him  Benavidez  found that his Hopes as well as Passion augmented and flatter'd himself that the Plot he was framing wou'd have its desired Effect he left Madam  Velasco  and  Leonida  to go with his Sister into her Apartment and after giving each other Proofs of an entire Affection I have something to say to you Brother said she come into my Closet She took him by the Hand and sitting down cou'd not help shedding a shower of Tears You weep my dear  Casilda  said he embracing her have you any Thing to say to me concerning Don  Henriquez  Ah Brother said she he is the ungrateful Object that troubles my Peace and remembers no more the Obligations he owes me I shall find some Ease in relating to you all that has  happen'd and as a disappointed Passion is less discreet than a successful one I am going to inform you of what you know but very imperfectly  Don  Henriquez  was on Board the Fleet with the Admiral his Father when one Day as the Queen was hunting and we all attending her Donna  Blanca  's Horse started and not knowing how to manage him ran away with her Several Cavaliers rode after her who were invited to serve her either by Inclination or Interest she being perfectly handsome and Daughter to  Leonora  who was then the Queen's Favourite As I am naturally politick enough I endeavour'd to reach her before the rest when I saw her from the rising Ground I was on fall in a Valley I rid as fast as possible to her Assistance where I no sooner came but the first Thing that struck my Sight was a Case set with Diamonds which drop'd out of her Pocket when she was thrown off her Horse I took it up and had no other Reason for not returning it instantly but the Curiosity of seeing what was in it Donna  Blanca  was in a Swoon when the rest of the Company came up they immediately gave her what they thought wou'd restore her to her Senses being stun'd with the Fall and as soon as she came to her self she perceiv'd she had lost her PictureCase which was sought for but in vain I took notice of all her Motions and her Uneasiness increas'd with the fear of not finding what was so dear to her This gave  me the greater Inclination to keep it with the only View to mortify her being one of the finest young Ladies of the Court and Daughter to the Favourite  As she had receiv'd no Hurt she went up to the Queen but appear'd so melancholy that her Mother express'd much Concern I was impatient to be alone that I might see what was contain'd in the Case but how can I tell you Brother or at least in telling you ought I not to dye with Shame I had but just cast my Eyes on the Picture which was inclos'd when I found such Motions in my Heart as surpriz'd me being what I never felt before I was charm'd with the noble Air and Youth of a Gentleman whose Features were so admirably well drawn that I cou'd no ways doubt but it very much resembled the Person whom it was design'd for I gaz'd at it with Delight and tho' unknown to me I thought it was impossible to see any Thing more lovely I did not consider at first how dangerous my Curiosity might prove so imploy'd some Hours in admiring this fatal Picture whose Idea it was not in my Power to deface It threw me into such Reflections as generally succeed excessive Transports Oh unhappy  Casilda  cry'd I what subtil Poison hath seiz'd thy Heart Art thou so tired with thy Liberty that thou must lose it this Day I know not who this is that seems so Charming I am well inform'd that he is in Love and is belov'd since Donna  Blanca  who is so beautiful  is the Guardian of his Picture which she show'd by her Uneasiness to be very dear to her What hopes then can I have of any Relief and to whom must I apply my self Shou'd not my Birth and Modesty be sufficient to impose Silence on me What cou'd I pronounce the Word I love and pronounce it in Favour of a Man who knows not the Value of so great a Sacrifice No my Eyes shall sooner be Witness of my Rival's Victory and I will die before I expose my self to the Shame which must needs succeed such a Confession But said I a Minute after is it possible that in such a little Time Love cou'd have made so great a Progress I am forc'd to lay a Command on my self not to speak of my Weakness and I have form'd a Rival without having a Lover  I confess to you Brother this caus'd so great a Change in me that I began not to know my self I was continually Thoughtful and Solitude was the only Thing I courted I fear'd to discover my Pain or seek for Means to know the Author of it If I show this Picture thought I Donna  Blanca  will be inform'd I have it and then I shall be oblig'd to return it she is belov'd and in so great Favour that I dare not declare my Sentiments much less contend with so dangerous a Rival  Two Months were over before I cou'd hear any Thing relating to this Affair I sometimes enquired what young Lords were absent among others they named Don  Garcia  Don  Pedro  d' Avilas  and Don  Frederick Henriquez  How cou'd I know whether the Man that possess'd my Thoughts was either of them I endeavour'd to be acquainted with their Character but those who were so complaisant as to describe them to me instead of giving me some light in the Matter left me more in the dark and in greater Despair I made it also my Business to discover whether Donna  Blanca  had not a known Engagement which I was persuaded was the only Thing cou'd satisfy me but they told me she was too imperious to receive the Addresses of any of the Grandees I knew the contrary tho' I was not at liberty to declare it so that I languish'd between small Hopes and cruel Fears Donna  Blanca  was taken ill of the SmallPox at this Time and there was a Necessity for her leaving the Court I cannot help confessing that I was extreamly pleas'd at my Rival's Misfortune Heavens cry'd I just Heaven make her as ugly as possible that the Passion of her Lover may turn to a mortal Aversion The Thoughts of this gave me some Ease tho' I look'd upon my being in love with a Person I did not know as the greatest Unhappiness that cou'd possibly attend me How wretched wou'd be my Fate said I to my self if this Picture with which I am so charm'd shou'd only prove the Painter's Fancy and that I shou'd never see its Original I reflected at last on which wou'd give me the most Uneasiness to see Donna  Blanca  ador'd by him I lov'd or  never to have hopes of seeing the Object of my Passion These in my Opinion were two cruel Extremes for I cou'd not determine my self on either and therefore concluded I was the most unfortunate Person in the World  My Mind was in this Situation when in the Queen's Apartment thinking of the Odness of my Adventure I went to the Window from whence I saw two Noblemen follow'd by many Attendants the youngest of the Two so perfectly resembled the Picture that I did not at all doubt but he was the Original already so dear to me In the first Motions of my Surprize I fetch'd such a Shriek and threw open the Sash with so much precipitation that every Body took Notice of it and tho' the Queen did not seem to mind it the first Lady of the BedChamber did and reprimanded me severely I recover'd the Disorder I was in as soon as possible and told her I was deceiv'd by taking the young Lord for my Brother whom I impatiently expected The Affair pass'd in this manner and I did all I cou'd to suppress the Agitation which might attend the first Sight of a Cavalier whose Shadow had so much disturb'd my Peace  In spite of all the Reflections I had made I was seiz'd with such violent Emotions when the Admiral and his Son enter'd the Queen's Chamber for it was they that I had like to have swooned Don  Frederick Henriquez  appear'd so thoughtful that I was griev'd to the Soul I ought not to flatter my self said I  that Donna  Blanca  is indifferent to him In his Looks I read my Misfortune He sympathizes with her in the Condition she is in and thinks none here worth his Notice Oh Barbarian cry'd I to my self you think of nothing but your Mistress cannot you turn your Eyes on me and see the deplorable State of wretched  Casilda  But Brother I am asham'd said she interrupting her self I am asham'd of unveiling my Weakness to you and exposing to your Censure Thoughts so offensive to the Modesty of my Sex I shall only tell you that the Queen came out of her Closet and the Ladies made a Circle about her when the Admiral gave her an Account of her Naval Force I resolv'd at that Instant on a Thing that will appear to you no less bold than precipitate which was to write to Don  Henriquez  therefore without consulting Reason or considering the Consequence I took out my  Tablettes  and address'd him in these Terms  AFfairs wherein the Heart is concern'd ought not to be defer'd I deplore the Condition of yours Give me an Opportunity of speaking to you and you shall be indebted to me for your Peace Let Secrecy be the Proof of your Gratitude At Night I shall expect you on the TerraceWalk under the Window by  Dian  's Statue I there shall acquaint you my Lord with some Circumstances in which you are particularly concern'd  When I had finish'd my Letter I was at a less how to convey it to Don  Henriquez  at  last I resolv'd to trust the young Count of  Oropez  with it his Post of being first Querry to the Queen gave him as you know an Opportunity of entertaining us often He had a great deal of Wit and having on several Occasions observ'd his Discretion I made a Sign to him and he came to me I have assured one of the young Ladies said I to him that you can keep a Secret and hope you will answer my good Opinion of you There is nothing in my power Madam reply'd he that I wou'd not do to convince you I am not undeserving your generous Sentiments It is not my Secret said I blushing I am going to intrust you with but that of my particular Friend who has a mind to perplex Don  Henriquez  She has just writ on my  Tablettes  I desire you will find an Opportunity to make him read it and do not forget to return them to me I shall never neglect Madam the least of your Commands reply'd he smiling tho' I cannot say you have charg'd me with so obliging a Commission as you wou'd have me think One Word more said I be assured I am not concern'd in it but notwithstanding shall ever acknowledge the Favour you do me in obliging my Friend  Oropez  left me immediately and acquitted himself of what I wish'd with great Address while he was with Don  Henriquez  I was extremely uneasy at this imprudent Step but was not long so for  Oropez  came back with my  Tablettes  where at the End of my Letter I found this Answer  I Never cou'd flatter my self that any Person was interested in the Concerns of my Heart but now I am happier than I imagin'd Your Commands shall be exactly obey'd I assure you of Secrecy and as for Gratitude it is the least Return I can make so much Generosity  These Words so agreeably flatter'd my Imagination that I long'd for Night with the greatest Impatience in the mean Time I made a thousand Reflections which gave me hopes and entertain'd me till the appointed Hour The Night was very dark and hearing some Body approach the Window I threw up the Sash and ask'd in a low Voice Don  Henriquez  is it you Yes Madam said he it is the Man in the World who is most indebted to you but at the same Time I cannot help saying that the Advantage you have over me is too unequal since you know me and I am not only unacquainted with you but even a stranger to what induces you to favour me with this Interview I will satisfy you presently said I in a trembling Voice and that you may not suspect I sent for you hither on a frivolous Subject know that I am  Casilda Benavidez  therefore my Lord do not use any Dissimulation but tell me upon Honour whether you are still in Love with Donna  Blanca  if you will not be sincere in this Confession I have nothing farther to say to you Don  Henriquez  seem'd very much surpriz'd at the Question and having paus'd a while made me this Answer  Donna  Blanca  is so charming that her Chains are glorious and since you believe I am her Captive I will not scruple to own it These Words threw me into a very great Confusion What do you love that perfidious Creature reply'd I who has made a Sacrifice of you and even dispos'd of your Picture to convince your Rival how indifferent you are to her With that I took a Light which I had hid for fear of being discover'd and obliging him to come nearer I shew'd him his Picture and look'd at him so tenderly that he might have read my Thoughts Don  Henriquez  after having view'd it turn'd his Eyes on me and I perceiv'd the Surprize was agreeable to him but as what I had told him was very unexpected he ask'd me how I came to know that he lov'd Donna  Blanca  and by what Misfortune he had forfeited her Esteem I can easily satisfy you both these Questions reply'd I your Absence having banish'd you from your Mistress's Heart Don  Diego Cuniga  made his Addresses to her and was favourably receiv'd His Father you know is one of the first Grandees and she being very ambitious easily conceiv'd a Passion for him of which she cou'd not have given a greater Proof than sacrificing your Picture to him His Vanity was satisfy'd but his Love instead of increasing by the Assurance he had of a Return made him slight her and even discontinue seeing her which she resented so much that it had like to have been the Cause of her Death He endeavour'd  to persuade me I was the Occasion of it for that if he had not seen me Donna  Blanca  's Impression wou'd never have been effac'd But as I had no Inclination to believe him and did not give him so obliging an Audience as he us'd to receive to alter my Disposition towards him he brought me your Picture told me every thing that pass'd when she gave it to him and beg'd I wou'd accept it as an Evincement that he never more wou'd renew his Addresses to her  Altho' I look'd on him as an unthinking young Gentleman I took the Picture and I protest to you my only Motive for so doing was to undecive you in relation to your ungrateful Mistress for tho' I had no Acquaintance with you I frequently heard so much in your Praise that it gave me no small Concern to see you thus betray'd by a perfidious Woman and therefore I resolv'd to do all in my Power to dissuade you from ever thinking of her more I will take your Advice Madam said he in a great Passion and Don  Diego Cuniga  shall find at his Return from  Sevil  that if I am not a dangerous Rival I am at least a troublesome Enemy but Madam continu'd he with a milder Voice I hope you will assist me in my Revenge on Donna  Blanca  you have been pleas'd to acquaint me with her Perfidiousness and I swear I am already dispos'd to have an Aversion for her Were you but concern'd in my Interest I shou'd certainly be restor'd to my self which happy State I only  desire that I may be the more able to lay my Heart at your Feet I dare assure you Madam that Constancy has ever been my Virtue and I am so well acquainted with Love that you will find in me a Passion if possible equal to your Beauty It is too late reply'd I smiling to answer a Proposal which you wou'd not have made me had you less reason to be piqu'd but as I am inclin'd to wish that your Words were sincere it will be a Pleasure to me when I find your Conduct engages me to determine in your Favour In the mean Time be very secret in regard to what is past your Compliance in this will be an easy way to establish you in my Esteem  I did not give Don  Henriquez  Time to make me an Answer but parted from him with so much Satisfaction that I wou'd not have chang'd my Destiny for that of a Queen My Mind was all that Night imploy'd on pleasing Ideas Donna  Blanca  is sick and absent thought I and will not appear at Court of a long Time it is possible her Sickness may deface her Charms and a Mistress who is suspected to be inconstant having lost that Attractive will find it a hard matter to justify her self Besides I have admirably well succeeded in my Stratagem Don  Henriquez  is inclin'd to like me and thinks he has Cause enough to break off with her What have I then to fear I shall have made the Conquest of his Heart before ever my Rival can be able to come and dispute it with me  I appear'd the Day following at Court in a rich Dress which every one admir'd having a particular Interest in adorning my self to the best Advantage and I dispos'd every Thing so well that Don  Henriquez  came and assured me he had no reason to complain of his Mistress's Proceedings and that he was so entirely pleas'd at the Discovery I had made him that it lay wholly in my Power to render him the most constant of Lovers This Declaration was attended with all the Courtship that cou'd be expected from a Man passionately in Love How great was my Felicity in those Days I was bless'd with all that Love and Gallantry cou'd inspire But Oh Brother I am ready to die when I call these Things to mind and have nothing now remaining but mortal Grief Are you entirely disengag'd said I sometimes to him and cou'd you resist Donna  Blanca  shou'd she endeavour to regain your Heart You must needs suspect my Sentiments reply'd he to question what I wou'd do in such an Occasion I take Heaven to witness charming  Casilda  that were she as constant as I cou'd have wish'd her and more beautiful than ever she appear'd to me I shou'd no longer confess her Power Tho' his Protestations transported me yet I had room to apprehend that when he saw my Rival a Discovery might be made in which I shou'd prove very unhappy I secretly reproach'd my self with my Perfidiousness and fear'd some Punishment wou'd attend it which was sufficient to make me uneasy therefore  I press'd Don  Henriquez  to sollicite his Father's Consent to our Marriage that they might afterwards join in their Request to the Queen about it which being once granted I shou'd have no longer reason to fear He represented to me the fantastical Humour of the Admiral but promis'd he wou'd apply himself with the greatest Care and Address in order to prevail with him These Assurances extremely flatter'd me and I was expecting the Effects of them when one Day the Queen went to take the Air in the Forest of  Javalles  attended by her Ladies who were riding by her open Chaise but we were hardly got to the Height of a little Hill when we discover'd in the Plain some Men on Horseback which we knew to be  Moors  They were engag'd with  Spaniards  whom they charg'd so vigorously that we thought them in the greatest Danger We saw at the same time a Lady at the Foot of the Tree appearing to us in a Swoon with several Women about her who by their Actions express'd much Concern  The Queen stop'd at some distance and saw this Engagement with great Uneasiness but Don  Henriquez  who had follow'd us came up to her and desired leave to go and succour the  Spaniards  which her Majesty having assented to and commanded some of her Guards to attend him he attack'd the  Moors  with so much Bravery that the Scene was chang'd in an instant and they being no longer able to oppose him were oblig'd to fly for Safety All this  while my fearful Thoughts were imploy'd on the Dangers he was expos'd to I was praying for his Success tho' already Conqueror and as I observ'd all his Actions with a watchful Eye I saw him approach the Ladies who were still frighten'd tho' their Enemies were fled  Don  Henriquez  had scarcely turn'd his Eyes towards them when spurring his Horse he rid full speed from the Place but perhaps he consider'd that so great a Slight to the Lady who was Donna  Blanca  might displease the Queen supposing she took Notice of it therefore his Politicks or rather my inevitable Misfortune forcing him to return he went up to her and alighting saluted her very coldly but what he said what so short and confus'd that in spight of her Attention she cou'd not comprehend it I owe you my Liberty said she my Lord for which I shall think my self eternally oblig'd to you tho' I am persuaded you knew not in whose Cause you fought No Madam answer'd he I was a Stranger to whom I render'd this Service I protest that had I known how far you were concern'd I shou'd have had Occasion for all my Generosity to support me in fighting for the most perfidious Person in the World And for my part reply'd Donna  Blanca  with an Air of Pride I retract my Obligation since you confess your self unworthy of being my Deliverer She said no more because one of her Women was near from whom I had this Relation but call'd for her Chaise and  went to meet the Queen Don  Henriquez  left her and came up first to give her Majesty the Particulars of what had pass'd and to let her know that it was Donna  Blanca  he had reliev'd who had like to have been carry'd off by the  Moors  At this Name I was Thunderstruck and my Imagination contriv'd a thousand Ways to torment me representing all I had to fear from so fatal a Rencounter Can any Misfortune be equal to mine said I Donna  Blanca  taken by the  Moors  was going by her Captivity to deliver me from all the Alarms her Return cou'd be capable of giving me She is rescu'd from this Danger and owes her Safety to the Arm of Don  Henriquez  I have now every thing to apprehend he is just come from her and I doubt has discover'd my Treachery I know not whether I deceive my self but his Looks tell me he loves her still The Thoughts of her being inconstant might have cured him but nothing can do it if he is once convinc'd of her Innocence I shall appear a Monster to him and become the Object of his Aversion Heavens what shall I do if what I dread should happen Whether Don  Henriquez  would not talk to me for fear of being taken Notice of or that he had no mind to it I cannot tell but he did not speak to me all that Day Donna  Blanca  who had not seen the Queen since her Recovery from the SmallPox took that Opportunity to kiss her Hand I was inconsolable to find her as handsome as ever and her Praise the Subject of every one's Discourse  whilst I as silent as Death was observing Don  Henriquez  who I thought did a Violence to his Inclination in not approaching her They appear'd both in some Confusion yet their Eyes seem'd to express more Love than Anger None but a Rival cou'd have known the Cause of these different Motions but Oh nothing escap'd my penetrating Jealousy I read in their Looks as I imagin'd my eternal Ruin  The Queen was return'd to  Villa Real  and I in her Apartment before I knew where I was or even which way I came I was lost in Melancholy and thought it was very cruel in Don  Henriquez  not to shew the least Concern for me What said I is his Passion come to this He who has render'd Donna  Blanca  so essential a Service and knows I apprehend nothing more than a Relapse does he thus neglect giving me Assurances of the contrary I pass'd all that Night in the greatest Anxiety and tho' I found my self indispos'd in the Morning I rose early and went to the Queen's Apartment fearing something might happen there prejudicial to my Interest  Donna  Blanca  appear'd at Court that Day finely dress'd and so beautiful that all but  Leonida  yielded to her Don  Henriquez  was just by me when my Rival enter'd the Chamber Heavens Madam said he how handsome she is What Pity it is she is false Why shou'd her Falsity affect you my Lord reply'd I since at present she ought to be indifferent to you It is true Madam answer'd he  sighing but I only deplore the Misfortune of those who wear her Chains You are very charitable said I and the Publick is much indebted to you Here such a Crowd of various Thoughts presented themselves to me that I was at a loss how to continue my Discourse and Don  Henriquez  without enquiring into the Cause of my Silence had his Eyes fix'd on Donna  Blanca  What's this cry'd I you appear to me different from what you were Yesterday Do you repent of having chang'd your Mind and are you still Slave enough to love that perfidious Creature Don't you remember that she sacrific'd you to a Man of no Merit which made me blush for her as much as I do now for you At this he interrupted me and said Indeed  Casilda  you must know me very little to frame such injurious Suspicions There is not a Man in the World who resents an ungenerous Usage more than I and let me assure you that after I have loaded her with Reproaches equal if possible to the Offence I will not only show an Indifferency for her but even despise her to such a degree that you shall have no reason to complain of my future Conduct  He pronounc'd these last Words so faintly that I was confounded What said I do you want to come to an  Eclaricissement  with Donna  Blanca  you cou'd do no more were she a Pattern of Tenderness and Constancy I suppose added I you wou'd have no Value for such a Mistress But give me leave to tell you  my Lord that if you speak to her I will never see you more He was surpriz'd at these Words and look'd at me a great while endeavouring to penetrate into the Cause of this Resolution He call'd to mind what Donna  Blanca  had said to him which gave him Suspicion enough to increase his Curiosity and tho' he promis'd to comply with my Commands he did it with so indifferent an Air that I could no ways doubt of my Misforfortune  I went from the Queen's Apartment into my own and flung my self upon my Bed half dead and drowned in Tears Soon after  Leonida  came into my Chamber who saw my Concern and Distraction which wanted very little of Despair and sitting by me did all she cou'd to soften my Grief without knowing the Cause of it But to disburden my Mind of part of its Depression I gave her an Account of what had pass'd As she had never been in Love and consequently unacquainted with what one in that State is capable of she cou'd not help condemning my Treachery to my Rival Oh  Leonida  said I you little know the Effects of a violent Passion every Thing is allow'd to Lovers when they are in pursuit of a Heart Say rather reply'd she that we often allow to our selves many Things which are very blameable If I have committed a Crime said I my Punishment is near Alas I was not mistaken Don  Henriquez  had found an Opportunity to speak to Donna  Blanca  his Impression was not  quite effac'd whatever reason she might have had to complain of his Behaviour They accused each other and by that means discover'd the Part I had acted I leave you to think Brother whether they were not reconciled at my Expence I was not long before I knew my Fate for  Henriquez  came and upbraided me with my Perfidiousness I wou'd have persuaded him he was still captivated by Donna  Blanca  and that by her artful Insinuations she had prevail'd and impos'd on him but the ill Opinion he had of me prevented his believing it As I knew his Temper I thought I cou'd not do better than confess the Motive which had incited me to make him quarrel with his Mistress Judge the Condition I was in dear Brother when I own'd that Love was the Occasion of my Guilt and expos'd my Weakness which I was then sure wou'd meet with a fatal Return I sought for Reasons to excuse my Crime by painting my Passion in the most lively Colours and my Tears convinc'd him of the Truth of what I said He heard me without the least Interruption but at last look'd at me with attention and assuming an imperious Air I think my self sufficiently reveng'd of your Treachery said he since you love me and I have no Thoughts of you but what are despising in finishing these Words he left me The Anger Shame and Grief which divided my Soul had like to have immediately ended my unhappy Life but  Leonida  came to me at that Time and us'd her Endeavours to  console me without the least Success I was meditating the Ruin of Donna  Blanca  and  Henriquez  and felt in my self such a disposition for a desperate Undertaking that nothing but the natural Sweetness of my Friend's Temper cou'd moderate my Rage My Rival tho' victorious wou'd not resolve to pardon me she complain'd to her Mother who was weak enough to enter into her Sentiments as a Confident and ever since they have watch'd all Opportunities for Revenge I have by their means forfeited the Queen's Favour and meet every Day with so many Subjects of Grief as would deprive me of Life cou'd any Thing be capable of it but the Loss of the ungrateful  Henriquez  I heard Yesterday that  Leonora  had prevail'd with the Queen to propose a Match to the Admiral between Donna  Blanca  and his Son and that he had given his Consent to it I shall soon see her triumph judge thenHere  Casilda  cou'd no longer restrain her Sighs and Tears which oblig'd her to be silent  Benavidez  who was extremely touch'd with her Affliction told her he wou'd fight Don  Henriquez  and neglected nothing which he thought cou'd lessen her Pain but as that which affects the Heart is very different from any other so it requires more Time for its Cure We shall find notwithstanding in the Sequel of  Casilda  's Story despairing as she was that many Years were not expired before she found Consolation  Benavidez  gave his Sister an Account of what had pass'd between him and the Prince of  Carency  and told her he must needs have  Leonida  's Picture for he had thought of an Expedient to make her have a great Aversion for her Lover but that he wou'd not declare his Passion to her till he was assured she had some Confidence in him for which reason he beg'd  Casilda  to sollicite his Interest who promis'd to act for him to the utmost of her Power Accordingly she desired Madam  Velasco  to let her Daughter sit for her Picture which in Opposition to the young Lady was immediately granted and given to  Benavidez  who caus'd another to be drawn but with so aukward an Air that none could see it without having a disdain for the Original This was the Picture he sent by an Express to the Prince with a Letter at the same Time telling him that that Piece wou'd show how charming the Person was whom Fate had decreed him since it was her perfect Likeness and that he had entertain'd her with his Merit but she hardly wou'd have Patience to hear any thing on that Subject which convinc'd him her Thoughts were imploy'd on some other Object  The Prince who gave too much Credit to  Benavidez  was struck with such Confusion at the sight of this Picture and Letter that he immediately wrote to him and without any Caution confess'd the Cruelty of so unhappy an Alliance and his Aversion for  Leonida  But as she had some reason to be persuaded that  her Picture wou'd produce a contrary Effect she often ask'd  Benavidez  out of a Motive of Selflove whether he had heard from him and what was his Opinion of her therefore as soon as he had receiv'd the Prince's Answer which was writ in such Terms as overjoy'd him being that nothing more disobliging cou'd be added he contriv'd that  Casilda  shou'd show it  Leonida  with such an Air of Secrecy as if he were no ways consenting to it The thing was carry'd on as he had design'd it  Leonida  read the Prince's Letter at which she was so offended that she immediately went and threw her self at her Mother's Feet and conjured her with Tears to break off a Marriage which wou'd render her the most unfortunate Creature in the World I will not pretend Madam to disobey you in any thing said she but is it possible that you your self wou'd occasion my Ruin Tho' I have but little Experience in the Sentiments one ought to have for a Husband yet it appears to me that without mutual Love nothing but continual Torment can be expected for how can I value the Man you have chosen for me since he has not only conceiv'd an Aversion for me but thinks me ugly and despises me Cannot you change my Fate Madam Oh rather let me never marry or if you are not pleas'd I shou'd live with you send me to a Monastry I will sooner embrace that State of Life than be united to a Prince for whom I have no Inclination Madam  Velasco  mov'd at her Daughter's Complaint  took her several Times in her Arms and endeavour'd to console her in a most tender manner If it wholly depended on me my dearest Child said she I wou'd soon ease your Mind but your Father is my Lord and we are both so far bound in Duty to comply with his Pleasure that I cannot promise you any thing till I know what are his Intentions As she had ended these Words Don  John  of  Velasco  enter'd the Chamber the Mother and Daughter flung themselves at his Feet and with Prayers and Tears conjured him to break off with the Prince They show'd him the Letter he had written to  Benavidez  but all wou'd not do Don  John  was determin'd to keep his Word with him even at the Expence of his Daughter's Happiness He answer'd them that the Contract was signed and nothing should ever make him revoke a thing he had concluded with the late Count of  La March  so  Leonida  withdrew in the greatest Affliction and having inform'd  Casilda  of her Father's Sentiments told her she was resolv'd to retire into a Monastry That will be no effectual Relief to you reply'd  Casilda  maliciously for a Man who hath so much Power as Don  John  will easily oblige his Daughter to quit a Place wherein she had thrown her self without his Consent But my dear  Leonida  your Grief is so moving that I have already propos'd Means to give you some Comfort My Brother who is entirely devoted to your Service and in whom you may faithfully confide has a fine  House near  Carmona  it is an agreeable Retirement surrounded with spacious Woods I will go and live with you there What my dear  Casilda  interrupted  Leonida  is your love for me so great as to quit the Court I cou'd make you a greater Sacrifice reply'd  Casilda  sighing you know the reasons I have to hate this fatal Place The false  Henriquez  will soon be marry'd to Donna  Blanca  I shall have nothing before my Eyes but what will increase my Despair and in spite of my Pride and Reason I cannot cease loving that cruel Man tho' he glories in my Weakness Absence is the only thing that can efface his Idea let us go charming  Leonida  continued she let us fly the Man I love and him you hate My Fate is more deplorable than yours reply'd  Leonida  your Absence will procure you some Ease and no Body will pursue you but as for my part I shall be pursued and perhaps discover'd and brought back to my Father's House where I shall meet with very severe Usage Ah how little do you know the sad Condition I am reduc'd to cry'd  Casilda  do you think it a Consolation to tell me that no Body will pursue me That is the chief Cause of my Grievance I cou'd wish the perfidious  Henriquez  wou'd abandon all and follow me Heavens how transported shou'd I be If you propose to enjoy a perfect Tranquillity reply'd  Leonida  do not harbour any Wishes so contrary to your Peace Alas I know not what to wish said  Casilda  then let us go Solitude  and Absence may chance to give some Ease to my Mind Young  Leonida  who had but little Experience and did not foresee the fatal Consequences of such an Undertaking consented to the dangerous Proposals of her Companion She embrac'd her a thousand Times and confess'd in a most tender manner her Obligation for the considerable Service she was going to render her They afterwards agreed on a Day and Hour to execute their Project and imploy'd all their Thoughts in taking such Measures as cou'd make it succeed  This was the State of Affairs when they were inform'd that the Count of  La March  was arriv'd at  Seville  with a magnificent Attendance and a Body of Eight Hundred Men to succour the Infanta Don  Fernand  who was then at War with the  Moors  The Virtue and eminent Qualities of this illustrious Prince were soon publish'd in  Spain  and the Prince of  Carency  his Brother had no small Share in the general Applause He had accompany'd the Count to  Seville  from whence he intended to go to  Villa Real  in order to marry  Leonida  but Fortune was preparing long Torments for him instead of those Pleasures he wou'd have tasted in the Possession of a Lady so charming and virtuous  The Prince wrote a Letter to  Benavidez  to acquaint him with his departure from  Seville  which he immediately communicated to  Leonida  She now thought it Time to be gone and without farther Consideration trusted her  self with  Casilda  to the Conduct of  Benavidez  who over joy'd and full of Hopes omitted nothing that was necessary in this Affair They left  Villa Real  and he accompany'd them some part of the Way but fearing his Absence from the Court at the Time of their disappearing might give some Suspicion of his having a hand in it he desired  Leonida  and his Sister to accept of one of his Friends who shou'd wait on them to their Journey's End being a Man whose Fidelity was so well known to him that he ran no Risque in trusting him with his Mistress and Sister  Benavidez  express'd much Concern in parting from  Leonida  who might have easily perceiv'd it had not her Thoughts been imploy'd otherways He took his leave of them and they continued their Journey with all the Diligence and Secrecy possible When they were arriv'd at  Benavidez  's House where no Body knew them they chang'd their Names  Leonida  call'd her self  Felicia  and  Casilda  took the Name of  Beatricia  saying they were Sisters and of the House of  Leon  The Gentleman who had accompany'd them return'd to  Villa Real  and gave an Account to  Benavidez  of their successful Journey whilst the young Ladies were taking the innocent Pastime of an agreeable Solitude  Benavidez  notwithstanding the Impatience he had to see  Leonida  appear'd at Court with a counterfeit Air of Gaiety But Heavens in what Affliction were Don  John  of  Velasco  and  his Lady when they perceiv'd their Daughter was gone They believ'd at first that she and  Casilda  were retired to a Monastry and  Benavidez  seem'd to believe the same saying That that was the only reason which prevented him from searching all  Spain  in order to find his Sister Don  John  who had greater Cause for Uneasiness imploy'd all Means to discover the Place where  Leonida  might be but his Enquiry being to no purpose he was almost in Despair  Benavidez  the mean while was proposing to himself no slender Share of Happiness in the Success of an Enterprize he had manag'd so artfully but the Queen being then inform'd that some Grandees of  Spain  who were dissatisfy'd with the Government were carrying on a traiterous Design and had resolv'd to deliver up some considerable Towns to the King of  Granada  she order'd that  Benavidez  who was Governour of one of those Places and had been impeach'd tho Innocent should be taken up This unexpected Blow threw him into a desperate Condition he fear'd it had been discover'd that  Leonida  was at his House and that he was arrested on that Account but when they told him that it was for High Treason he thought himself too happy and seem'd less mov'd for the Loss of his Life than the losing of  Leonida  however his being prevented from going to see her increas'd his Grief to such a Degree that he cou'd not conceal it from his Guards which made them conclude him guilty  The Prince of  Carency  arriv'd at this time at  VillaReal  and did not know what to think of the many Reports he heard The flight of  Leonida  and  Casilda Benavidez  's Imprisonment and the distracted Condition of  Don John  of  Velasco  and his Lady as well as his Concern for a Person to whom he was contracted and the Necessity he was under of using his utmost Endeavours to find her together with his Indifferency for her all these united perfectly confounded him He made an ineffectual Attempt to speak to  Benavidez  who was so strictly guarded that he judg'd the Affair he was accus'd of wou'd meet with no Favour if once convicted unless the Queen's Goodness wou'd prevail with her Justice He heard that  Leonora  was her Favourite and having a strong Inclination to be serviceable to his Friend he made his Court to this old Lady who tho' as proud as great cou'd not but conceive a particular Esteem for the Prince  Don John  and his Lady were so charm'd with him that their Satisfaction wou'd have been compleated had not his Presence renew'd all the Grief which the Loss of  Leonida  occasion'd so that nothing cou'd moderate the Affliction of these disconsolate Parents  The Prince of  Carency  was presented to the Queen who received him with a Respect equal to his Birth and Merit Donna  Leonora  used to speak so often to her of his fine Qualities that she soon perceiv'd her Favourite look'd on him with an obliging Eye and that he triumph'd  in her Esteem over the other Princes and Grandees of the Court He constrain'd himself as much as possible to oblige her being invited by no other Motive than to serve  Benavidez  Oh had he known that he was working for the greatest of his Enemies and one who was endeavouring his Ruin he wou'd have left him to his evil Genius  One Day as the Queen was walking in the PalaceGardens attended by most of the Court Donna  Leonora  affected to keep at some distance which the Prince of  Carency  perceiving he went and saluted her she receiv'd him very graciously and ask'd him if he wou'd go with her into a green Arbour that was not far After he had return'd her Compliment he led her to the Place where being set down she spoke to him in this manner Do you take this Opportunity I give you my Lord of entertaining me as a Favour I seldom grant to any Your Youth Wit and Quality are sufficient Motives to make you admired but as I have no Inducements to create a Passion be so kind as to tell me from whence proceeds the desire you have of conversing with me Is it the Effect of a Sympathy that is frequently found between two Hearts and for which no reason can be assign'd The Prince was very much surpriz'd at what he heard but still had a mind to obtain her Favour on the Account of  Benavidez  without intending to make any Declaration that might distinguish a Lover from a Friend He look'd at her some time as  one astonish'd which entirely confounded  Leonora  You ought Madam said he to be convinc'd that you have highly oblig'd me in condescending to this Interview which is an Honour I have this long time wish'd for but if you will give me leave to improve this Occasion let it be in behalf of the unfortunate  Benavidez  I know the Queen has so just an Opinion of your good Sense that she will readily assent to any thing you are pleas'd to promote Grant him your Protection it is the greatest Favour I can ask Your Petition is not very great reply'd  Leonora  in an angry Tone when you imploy for another the Opportunity you ought to embrace for your self Is it possible my Lord that you can think of your Friend's Interest and neglect your own Oh I see too well that I am deceiv'd there can be no Passion where there appears so much Indifferency This embarass'd the Prince more than ever any Thing had done yet he try'd to conquer himself and taking her by the Hand You know very little Madam said he the Language of my Eyes when you form so ill a Judgment of my Sentiments as to doubt of my Passion Your Charms are the only Subject of my Contemplation and the Fear of offending you was the Cause of my Silence This obliging Confidence my Lord reply'd she equally flatters my Vanity and Love for I cou'd not think my self so happy in your Favour I am infinitely pleased at the Confession you have made me  and since you wou'd have me serve  Benavidez  I promise you to do it effectually whether he be innocent or guilty he shall be set at Liberty The Prince made his Retributions to her in so grateful a manner that she was perfectly charm'd with him but as he was tired with this disagreeable Conversation he impatiently rose up and took his Leave  When he was alone he abandon'd himself to those Reflections which were most painful to him Heaven just Heaven cry'd he what am I reserv'd for I find my self intangled in an Amour with the ugliest of Women and who is the only one that ever gave me a favourable Audience Oh I love my Unknown at  Nicopolis  and  Olympia  's Memory is still dear to me  Leonida  prevented by some Fatality has chosen rather to fly her Father's House than yield to his Commands Now must I to serve my Friend counterfeit a Passion for this Favourite who is an Object fitter to inspire Aversion than a more obliging Sentiment  Tho' he reproach'd the Cruelty of his Fate yet he did not omit paying his Devoirs every Day to  Leonora  whose Passion rose to that Violence at last that she determin'd to marry him which was the thing in the World he least thought of She sent to him and desired he wou'd come to her which having obey'd my Lord said she if in the Profession you have made me there is more Truth than Complaisance and that you are touch'd as much as  you wou'd persuade me you cannot give me a greater Proof of it than by uniting your Destiny with mine I will not trouble you with a Detail of my Birth and Fortune all  Spain  can inform you of both but shall content my self with assuring you that you will find in me so good a Friend in becoming your WifeMy Wife have you such a thought cry'd the Prince interrupting her Here he was silent but perceiving his Mistake he endeavour'd to recover it and assuming a tender Air such an Alliance Madam said he wou'd infinitely please me if I were not engag'd to  Leonida  and you know it is not in my Power to retract my Promise No cruel as you are I know nothing interrupted  Leonora  in a furious manner I saw your Surprize and Horror at a Proposal you are not worthy of you have not only deceived me but have also deceiv'd your self Know Sir that in this Kingdom you must not dare to offend a Person of my Quality unpunish'd especially one who has as much Power as the Queen  Benavidez  shall be my first Victim and take care perfidious as you are that you be not the Second In finishing these Words she gave him a menacing Look went into her Closet and shut the Door with great Violence leaving the astonish'd Prince in her Chamber  He immediately went to Madam  Velasco  's and without any Reserve acquainted her with all that had pass'd You may be well assured Madam said he that were I not even contracted  to  Leonida  I wou'd sooner chuse to dye than marry a Woman who by her Cruelties is become odious to all  Spain  I know her Birth and Fortune are equally great but I despise them both therefore give me your Advice Madam and tell me what Measures I must take to deliver my self from this Monster without exposing the Life of  Benavidez  That is a harder Task than you imagine reply'd Madam  Velasco  the violent Temper of this Woman has already sacrific'd many and I tremble for you The Queen loves her to such a degree that she will blindly condescend to all her Desires Alas my Lord why are you in  Spain  Or why are you not the Husband of  Leonida  With this she burst out into a Flood of Tears You weep Madam said he and I have reason to believe you are concern'd for me Do you think this Affair will have any other Consequence than my being oblig'd to quit  Villa Real  I am no Subject of  Spain  neither is a Man of my Rank to be insulted without Revenge and I am assured that if  Leonora  sees me no more she will soon forget me Then prepare to depart my dear Son reply'd Madam  Velasco  embracing him tenderly I will take my Daughter with me into  France  if she is living and nothing shall alter the Resolution I have taken to make her eternally yours  Tho' nothing cou'd be more obliging than the Assurances Madam  Velasco  gave the Prince yet he did not extremely wish for the Performance  He was in hopes that either  Leonida  wou'd not be found or that her Aversion for him wou'd continue in which Case the Marriage of Course must needs break off and he wou'd be no longer under the Obligation of executing his Father's Commands He immediately took leave of Don  John  of  Velasco  being resolv'd to go away the same Night in order to join the Count of  La March  his Brother who was waiting at  Seville  for the Infanta Don  Fernand  to march against the  Moors  He retired early to his Apartment and gave Orders that all things shou'd be ready for his Journey but  Leonora  who had Spies over the Prince's Actions was soon acquainted with his sudden Resolution and seeing she had no Means left to prevail with him ran and threw her self at the Queen's Feet conjuring her with Tears in her Eyes to take pity of her Weakness The Prince of  Carency  is parting Madam said she he abandons me and I shall be the wretchedest Creature in the World without your Majesty is pleas'd to protect me The hopes of being his Wife flatter'd by his Assiduity and faithless Protestations made so deep an Impression on me that it was not in my Power to decline a Passion which wou'd have united our Destinies But the Traitor has deceiv'd me and I am going to lose him for ever unless you give immediate Orders to have him seiz'd What Pretence cou'd I have to act in that manner reply'd the Queen with that Complaisance which was usual to her he is  contracted to  Leonida  and Don  John  of  Velasco  is in great Power He has Friends and Relations in this Court and shou'd I undertake to break his Daughter's Contract in favour of you it wou'd be doing him the greatest Injustice Besides with what Authority cou'd I do it I have no Power over that young Prince Don't you know he is related to the King of  France  and that a Man of his Quality is not to be dealt with like other People then consider that the Count of  La March  his Brother is actually at  Seville  and is SoninLaw to the King of  Navarre  all these Things are to be weighed with Deliberation Ah Madam reply'd  Leonora  I do not intend to expose your Majesty when I intreat you to detain the Prince you have a good Pretence to do it without my appearing any ways concern'd There is an intimate Friendship between him and  Benavidez  and wou'd it not be sufficient to make the World understand that the Prince has a Hand in the Rebellion Your Authority dispenses you from giving an Account of your Actions and who dares inquire into your Conduct The Prayers and Tears of this old Favourite prevail'd at last with the Queen and she consented that a Captain of the Guards should go immediately and put the Prince under Arrest which was no sooner executed but the Queen had him brought before her and having order'd every Body to withdraw spoke to him in these Terms What my Lord said she cou'd one have thought you capable  of betraying us and that under the Notion of a Friend you were privately conspiring with those who intended to deliver up some Towns of this Kingdom to the Barbarians Don't pretend Prince to say any thing in your Defence for nothing can justify you I am too well inform'd of your Intreagues so prepare your self to undergo the Punishment you deserve Your eminent Birth will not protect you without my Favour and if I grant you your Life it shall at least be at the Expence of your Liberty Donna  Leonora  loves you my Lord and has already interceded for Grace if you will marry her I may in regard to her forget the pernicious Designs you had form'd against this Kingdom  The Prince heard with all the Respect imaginable what the Queen had to say then answer'd her with a noble and undaunted Air My Heart is incapable said he of forming so mean a Design as that which your Majesty lays to my Charge and I have too much Interest in justifying myself to consent that you should forget my Crime in Consideration of  Leonora  No Madam I refuse the Mercy you offer me and demand nothing but Justice which I have no Cause to fear be it ever so severe Go then Prince said the Queen you shall be strictly guarded and severely punished if guilty  He was conducted from thence to the same Castle where  Benavidez  was Prisoner and confin'd several Days with Orders that no Body  should be admitted to him However this Affair could not be carry'd on with so much Secrecy but that  Don John  of  Velasco  was informed how ill they used the Prince for whom he had so great a Value He address'd himself to the Queen about it in very warm Terms and even threatned her with the King of  France  's Resentment but she was resolv'd to venture at all and show no favour to him unless he marry'd  Leonora  This imperious Favourite who was the only Person that had leave to see the Prince came one Night into his Chamber richly adorn'd with Jewels but so frightful as to her Person that he could hardly prevail with himself to look at her Nothing shall be impossible to me said she my lovely Prince taking him by the Hand I have every thing in my Power and if you will marry me I promise to deliver you out of this horrible Prison but if you are too proud and despise me be assured you shall pass the rest of your Days here or end your Life in a more tragick Manner Ha continued she perceiving in his Countenance a great deal of Anger mix'd with disdain Do you conceive less Horror for the Block than for my Person I am not young I confess yet such as you see me I can make the Felicity of the greatest Princes in  Spain  who daily offer me their Sighs and Vows which with mine I sacrifice to you See my my dear Prince See what a shameful part you make me act I blush in confessing my  Weakness and your Obligation to me ought to be the greater I who make all the Court tremble am here before you like a Victim uncertain of Life or Death waiting its Doom say then will you decide my Fate You are the only Man that can make me happy and without you I am for ever wretched Whilst  Leonora  was speaking the Prince of  Carency  felt so violent an Aversion for her that he cou'd hardly command his Passion but having overcome it a little he said with a very indifferent Air Are you not yet satisfy'd with what you make me suffer and will you for ever persecute me with a Passion to which I can make no Return I declare that in my Thoughts the Misfortune of being belov'd by you is one of the greatest that could happen to me and since my Sincerity offends you pursue your Rage and let your Vengeance fall on a Man who can reproach himself with no other Crime but that of having given you room for some Time to believe he cou'd like you After these Words he was silent and whatever she cou'd say to him he wou'd not make her any Answer  She ran out of his Chamber like a Fury threat'ning him with speedy Death and from thence went directly to see  Benavidez  who was very uneasy as one may well conceive having been disappointed in his Design relating to  Leonida  and not knowing whether she was still at his House or whether since his Confinement her Father had not found her out  and marry'd her to the Prince of  Carency  besides he cou'd not tell but the Crime he was accus'd of tho' innocent might cost him his Life  These Reflections were tormenting him when he saw  Leonora  coming into his Chamber he cou'd not imagine the Cause of so unexpected a Favour and just as he was going to make his Retributions to her she began in these Terms  Benavidez  said she with a Voice that express'd the Motions of her Soul your Life or Death now depends on the best of your Friends you are impeach'd and believed guilty The Prince of  Carency  who loves you entirely is actually a Prisoner with you in this Castle and I am willing to let you know that I have conceiv'd a particular Esteem for that Prince you shall have leave to see him and be sure you use your utmost Endeavours to persuade him to marry me in which Case I answer for your Liberty but otherwise you will have Cause to fear both for him and your self Farewel Remember now that your Interest and mine must be the same After having spoke to him in this manner she gave him no time to make any Answer but went away with great Precipitation  Benavidez  who before was despairing cou'd not hear this News without being extremely pleas'd He resolv'd to use his utmost Address in persuading the Prince and as he knew the Influence he had over him he flatter'd himself  with easily overcoming all Difficulties What a Happiness will it be cry'd he if he yields to  Leonora  's Desires I shall then be sure of my charming  Leonida  and this Favourite whom I shall oblige will in Gratitude imploy her Credit to make her mine I find it is not as yet known where she is my House has this Treasure still in its Possession and assoon as I obtain my Liberty I will go and visit her in her Retirement After having imploy'd his Thoughts on so agreeable a Change of Fortune he could not help reproaching himself with the treacherous Part he had acted towards his Friend and  Leonida  No said he I shall never enjoy a real Felicity since I must be oblig'd to deceive two Persons who so entirely deserve my Affection and will be inconsolable when they come to know one another to find their Destiny chang'd by my Perfidiousness These Reflections gave him some Concern but as his Love transcended his Friendship he resolv'd to arm himself against all Remorse  Whilst he expected with great Impatience to speak with the Prince of  Carency  Don  John  of  Velasco  was using all his Endeavours to get him out of Prison He at last brib'd one of the Guards who having brought Ropes and a File help'd to cut the Bars of his Window and the Night being very dark they both escap'd on Horses that were waiting for them  But this could not be done so secretly as not to alarm some of the Guards who heard  a Noise in the Prince's Apartment which they enter'd and perceiving his Flight went immediately to give Notice of it to  Leonora  This News made her furious She order'd several Horsemen who were all devoted to her Interest to pursue him and was so confounded that without knowing what she said she commanded them to take different Ways and told 'em that in case they overtook him and cou'd not prevail with him to return they shou'd kill him But after they had left her and the first Effects of her Passion were over she reflected on the cruel Commands she had given and did not at all doubt but they wou'd be too well executed by those Villains What cry'd she am I going to be the Murderer of a Man for whom I wou'd willingly lay down my Life and do I convey the Poinyard to his Breast Oh unjust Fate Why are you not contented with taking from me the Object I love without making me the Author of his Death Being thus prepossess'd with dismal Thoughts she was no more Mistress of her self she sent immediately to countermand her inhuman Orders but alas it was too late they had kill'd the Prince in spite of his brave Resistance which was so great that he wou'd not have been overcome but by a vast Superiority  Leonora  was saluted with this News at  VillaReal  which she receiv'd as one who already expected it and had no other Thought but that of dying The Prayers and Tears of the  Queen were of no force She tore her Hair and wounded her Face and her extreme Grief soon forwarded her Death which made some Atonement for the Barbarity she had just caus'd to be acted on one of the finest Princes in the World  Don  John  of  Velasco  and his Lady were inconsolable for his Loss reproaching themselves for not giving him a sufficient Guard they regretted him as if he had been their own Child and loaded with Imprecations the Memory of  Leonora Benavidez  not being so strictly guarded as before was soon inform'd of the Prince's Death but his Love triumph'd over his Gratitude which made him perfectly insensible of the Misfortune of a Person who had lov'd him so entirely  Whilst these Things were passing at Court  Leonida  and  Casilda  under the Names of  Felicia  and  Beatricia  were strangely alarm'd in their Solitude the Gentleman who had left them safe there acquainted them with  Benavidez  's being made a Prisoner of State and accus'd of having a Correspondence with the  Moors Casilda  at this News was resolv'd to go back to  VillaReal  in order to intetcede for her Brother and do him what Service she was capable of but  Leonida  who fear'd to remain there alone represented to her that as  Leonora  was not her Friend and that through her means she had already lost the Queen's Favour her Presence instead of mending her Brother's Affairs would make them worse that  besides she wou'd have the Mortification of seeing  Henriquez  marry'd to Donna  Blanca  which wou'd only renew her Grief These Arguments wou'd not have prevail'd with  Casilda  had she not apprehended that in leaving  Leonida  who in the mean Time might return to her Father's House  Benavidez  wou'd lose all the Fruits of her artificial Management which Consideration prevented her Journey  Leonida  and  Casilda  us'd often to walk in a Forest near their House and one Evening as they were sitting by the side of a Rivulet a Horse ran by in a full Gallop which frighten'd them very much seeing no Body on his Back they quitted the Place hastily and as they were in their Way towards the Castle their Surprize was much greater when they perceiv'd two Men lying on the Ground wounded and cover'd with Blood such a Sight was very frightful to these young Ladies who believing they were dead durst not approach them but ran home and call'd some of their Servants with whom they immediately came back in order to give Assistance to these two Gentlemen if happily it were not too late  The Ladies now having some Attendance with them came up to these unknown Cavaliers and found that one of them was already dead and the other still breathing  Leonidà  who had hitherto seen all Mankind with Indifferency seem'd to have something more than Compassion for the Misfortune of this Stranger whom one might judge by his noble  Air and Dress to be of the first Quality and as  Casilda  appear'd to be equally concern'd  Leonida  did not so much wonder at the Effects it produc'd in her  Oh what pity wou'd it be cry'd  Leonida  looking at  Casilda  shou'd this Stranger die but what hopes can one have of his Life It is possible he is now expiring In saying this she sprinkl'd Water on his Face and laid his Head on her Knees whilst  Casilda  caus'd a sort of Carriage to be made with the Branches of a Tree at last fetching a Sigh he open'd his Eyes and perceiving  Leonida  made an Effort to speak to her but his Spirits being wasted he fell into a Swoon which gave them reason to believe his Life was in danger  Leonida  and  Casilda  whom I must now call  Felicia  and  Beatricia  when the Carriage was finish'd order'd their Servants to lay the Stranger on it and thus they convey'd him to their House in great Silence being perplex'd with such a multitude of Thoughts as wou'd not admit of any Interruption As soon as they were there they sent to  Carmona  for a Surgeon who after having probed his Wounds told them they were not Mortal This agreeable News chang'd the Scene of Sorrow into that of Joy  Felicia  went to his Bedside and by this time he had recover'd his Speech which he imploy'd in returning Thanks for her Generosity I can no longer deplore said he in a feeble Voice the dismal Adventure that had happen'd to me since it gives me an Opportunity  of knowing the most deserving Person in the World but I fear Madam my being in your House may incommode you which extremely lessens the Satisfaction I shou'd have to be where you are In saying these Words he look'd at her with so much Admiration and Pleasure that had she understood the Language of his Eyes she wou'd have easily guess'd at the Motions of his Heart Do not be uneasy Sir reply'd she you shall want for no Assistance nor have reason to apprehend we see you here with Displeasure you are now in a Condition wherein Silence and Rest are equally necessary which Reason induces me to leave you with that she retir'd and left  Beatricia  behind her who as soon as  Felicia  was gone approach'd the Bed and said to him Tho' may Sister hath assured you how desirous we are to be serviceable to you yet I must repeat the same and conjure you Sir to have no other Thought but that of recovering your Health It will be no easy matter Madam reply'd the Prince to recover in a Place where the Objects I see may prove more Dangerous to me than the Wounds I have receiv'd  Beatricia  who did not doubt but these Words were address'd to her seem'd not to comprehend their meaning but taking leave of him went to  Felicia  's Apartment and ask'd her what the Stranger had said to her She without dissembling gave her an Account of their Conversation which very much pleas'd  Beatricia  I must confess said she he express'd himself more obligingly  to me than he did to you These Words gave some Uneasiness to  Felicia  without knowing from whence it proceeded  Beatricia  who was in a different Disposition of Mind propos'd to her self that the only means to banish Don  Henriquez  from her Heart was to yield it to another Whatever Trouble a new Inclination may give me thought she it never can be equal to the Pain I endure The Man I love is now in the Arms of Donna  Blanca  and all my hopes on that side are vanish'd but in placing my Affection on some other Object it may be kindly return'd I had Cause enough to apprehend that  Felicia  wou'd appear more beautiful than me in the Eyes of this lovely Stranger but his Words have convinc'd me of the contrary and I am resolv'd to be favourable to him whatever may be the Event Love is a pleasing Torment  The Prince of  Carency  continued ill some time and during his Illness receiv'd daily Instances of the Generosity of these Ladies particularly  Felicia  's obliging Behaviour to him on all occasions made him desirous to express his Gratitude He began to think his Preservation was chiefly owing to her tender Care and by Degrees fell desperately in Love which threw into the following Reflections How difficult a Task will it be to make an Impression on that unpractis'd Heart Her modest Looks and the Blushes which cover her Cheeks every time I cast my Eyes on her  evince how little she his acquainted with Love and dare I flatter my self with succeeding in such an Attempt No I must not hope for so great a Favour from Fortune I was belov'd at  Nicopolis  by a Person I never knew I no sooner became Captive to the Charms of a Lady at  Genoa  but Death snatch'd the dear Object from me and lately as I arriv'd at  VillaReal  with a Resolution to marry  Leonida  I was inform'd of her Flight and Aversion to me Alas my unkind Stars were not satisfy'd to afflict me with all these Misfortunes They have sent me a greater one  Leonora  's Passion for me Her desperate Rage caus'd me to be treated in this barbarous manner and her Cruelty wou'd still threaten my Days with the greatest Dangers were she inform'd that I had escap'd and was now in this Place but Oh how can I resolve to leave  Felicia  who is already more dear to me than the Life I wou'd endeavour to preserve All I can do in this distressed State is to change my Name I am inclin'd to believe that as I was taken for the Count of  La Vagne  at  Genoa  I may pass for the same here where I am not known If it be my good Fortune to render my Sentiments agreeable to this lovely Charmer I shall never wish for a greater Blessing I do not doubt but she has an Affection for her Sister therefore I must address my self to her and obtain Favour if possible by her means The Prince us'd often to entertain himself after this manner betwixt Hope and Fear  Beatricia  one Morning rose earlier than  Felicia  and went to see the Prince who was awake and had rested very ill all Night Assoon as he saw her enter the Chamber he thank'd her for so obliging a Care and told her he hop'd she had repos'd much better than he had done I must confess Sir said she I have felt some Uneasiness which I must lay to your Charge since it proceeds from the Curiosity I have to know who you are and the Uncertainty I am in of being satisfy'd on that Subject You judge very unfavourably of my Gratitude Madam reply'd the Prince if you think me capable of not obeying your Commands I am of  Genoa  and of the House of  Fiesque  my Title is the Count of  La Vagne  I have been some Years in my Travels and as I was riding thro' the neighbouring Forest in my Way to  Seville  I was assaulted by Robbers I did my Endeavour to resist them but their Number overpower'd me and left me Madam in the Condition you saw me I know your Family my Lord reply'd  Beatricia  and cou'd have judg'd in seeing you that your Extraction was illustrious The Count of  La Vagne  for now I must give that Title to the Prince of  Carency  interrupted her to enquire after  Felicia  but with a kind of Impatience which did not very much please  Beatricia  who in a cold manner made Answer she had not as yet seen her As she was speaking the Surgeon came in to the dress Prince's Wounds so she thought fit to retire She went directly from thence to  Felicia  's Apartment who was  just rising What said she to  Beatricia  dress'd already How comes it Sister you are up so early I can give you no other Reason reply'd she only I was asham'd to lie a Bed so fine a Morning But will you believe I have been to visit the Stranger and that I know his Name and Country You may as well say interrupted  Felicica  that you know also the Secrets of his Heart No reply'd  Beatricia  smiling I am very sincere and can assure you our Conversation ended with his acquainting me that he is of  Genoa  and is call'd the Count of  La Vagne  As you are to visit him next perhaps you may learn something more I have not so much Curiosity as you imagine reply'd  Felicia  and I fancy I shall trouble him but very little with my Presence Accordingly she did not go into the Prince's Chamber till late in the Evening being then inform'd he was very ill for his Uneasiness at not seeing her all that Day and the Pain occasion'd by his Wounds had thrown him into a violent Fever As soon as she approach'd his Bed he look'd at her with much Tenderness and said I flatter'd my self more than I ought to have done Madam in thinking the Condition I am in had mov'd your Pity since I find at present nothing touch'd you but the sad Aspect of a dying Man pierc'd with Wounds and lying in a Sea of Blood You abandon me charming  Felicia  and take no Care to preserve the Life of an unhappy Wretch who is indebted to you alone for the small Share  he has left of it I would not incommode you with a Visit my Lord reply'd  Felicia  my Sister having told me this Morning that in the State you are in nothing was more necessary than Repose No no Madam said he interrupting her you have not thought on me Donna  Beatricia  did not hinder you from coming to see me your Eyes convince me of the Truth and you only wish my Recovery to banish me your Presence for ever He said this with an Air so moving that she cou'd not help showing in her Looks more Affection than Indifferency You have been here so little a while reply'd she that I hardly have had time to consult my Inclinations yet give me leave to assure you that I find nothing in them to your Prejudice and shou'd very much regret my having known you if I thought in leaving this Place you wou'd entirely forget me She express'd these last Words blushing and with some Fear which charm'd the Prince who was going to make his Retributions when  Beatricia  enter'd the Chamber in some Disorder One of my Women my Lord said she who is just return'd from walking in the Forest found this Picture in the same Place where we first saw you I suppose it is yours and the Person it represents is too charming not to merit all your Affection The Prince told her it was true the Picture had been recommended to his Care and receiv'd it with a deep Sigh It was that which  Olympia Doria  had presented to him This gave much Uneasiness to  Felicia  who cou'd not help desiring to see it but had hardly turn'd her Eyes on it when her Mind was fill'd with Trouble which to conceal she retired to her Closet where being alone I thought said she I had only  Casilda  to fear but alas my Fate is much more severe for certainly the Person he loves is the most beautiful Creature in the World and his Passion is return'd since she has given him her Picture If he shou'd cease to love her on my Account it would be a Perfidiousness that might give me room to fear in my turn a resembling Destiny and if he is constant to her what can I hope She yielded her self up to these sad Reflections and leaving them for others more tormenting Oh continued she cou'd any thing be more fatal than this last Adventure I flew from the Prince of  Carency  because my Parents wou'd have me marry contrary to my Inclination I thought my self safe in this Forest where I only apprehended to meet with wild Beasts but these fierce Animals have done me no harm It is a Stranger a dying Man that has deprived me of my Peace and made me acquainted with Sentiments I thought  Leonida  's Heart incapable of receiving A shower of Tears attended these Words and she resolv'd never more to see this dangerous Cavalier for which reason she feign'd an Indisposition and confin'd her self to her Bed but cou'd not help enquiring after the Count who was now extremely ill His Fever was very much increas'd by his not seeing  Felicia  and his anxious Reflections so tormented him that he thought of nothing but Death  He was in evident danger when  Beatricia  enter'd  Felicia  's Chamber all in Tears There are no hopes left Sister cry'd she the unhappy Count is dying If you have a mind to see him before he expires you have no time to lose  Felicia  was not prepar'd for this disagreeable News which had like to have thrown her into a Swoon but being a little recover'd she repented the obstinate Resolution she had made to see him no more She thought now she was going to lose him for ever and that such a Loss wou'd make her the most unfortunate Person in the World Ye Powers above cry'd she going towards his Apartment give me the Count of  La Vagne  were he never to love me shou'd he even hate me let him live  She ran into his Chamber whilst he was in a fainting Fit his Eyes were shut and he had neither Voice nor Pulse She approach'd him trembling and raising his Head laid it on her Bosom bathed his Face with Tears and at that Instant was more to be deplor'd than him she lamented At last he fetch'd a deep Sigh and opening his Eyes was transported to find his dear  Felicia  near him and so touch'd at his Illness He look'd languishing at her and making an Effort to speak Ah divine  Felicia  said he is it you that gives me Assistance and are you come to save me from Death You need no longer fear for a Life  I cannot lose since its Preservation is become your Concern My Lord reply'd she low enough to be heard only by him believe me your Life is very dear to me and I wish nothing more than its continuance If you knew what you have made me suffer you Here  Beatricia  interrupted them by her Presence so they cou'd not pursue their Discourse But these few Words produc'd such wonderful Effects in the Count that he daily recover'd  How much were these Lovers to be pitied not knowing each other Chance had contriv'd to make them meet yet it was their unhappy Destiny not to enjoy a Blessing for which they wou'd have sacrific'd every Thing Such is the Misfortune of some Persons who purchase the most innocent Pleasures at the Expence of a thousand Torments  Felicia  accompany'd by her Sister went often to see the Count who observ'd the Care she took never to be alone with him but he could not desire  Beatricia  to give him an Opportunity of entertaining  Felicia  for tho' of all Mankind he had the least Vanity yet he perceiv'd by her Looks and Expressions that she had some favourable Thoughts of him and consequently an improper Person for a Confidant But one Evening hearing she was gone into the Forest without her Sister he caus'd himself to be dress'd and tho' he had hardly Strength enough to walk yet went to  Felicia  's Apartment  She cou'd not help being very much surprized when she saw the Count who fell at her Feet without having power to speak one Word He took her Hand and kiss'd it with such Transports as express'd the Motions of his Soul  Felicia  's disorder was not inferior to his They looked at one another as if they had met after a long Absence at last the Count broke Silence You have inspired me Madam said he with a Passion so transcendent that you must needs have perceived it in all my Actions and I must confess I thought you took some Pity on me but I have too much Cause to believe the contrary since your Looks express the utmost Indifference Oh judge how uneasy I am at this cruel Uncertainty I now come to know my Fate and conjure you adorable  Felicia  to tell me what I must expect My Love is such that nothing can ever make it change and were I Sovereign of the Universe I would lay it at your Feet Here he was silent and  Felicia  reply'd with as much Grace as Modesty My Concern was so great whilst you were speaking my Lord that I did not consider you were on your Knees I beg you will rise if you are desirous I should say any thing to you He obey'd her Commands but fear'd to cast his Eyes on her being like a Man who expected to hear the Sentence of his Death We are both in a disorder said she which we might have avoided had you not spoke to me of your Passion I must confess my Lord to my Shame that  the same Inclination which engag'd you to entertain me has prevailed with me to hear you What more can I say of my Weakness continued she blushing I discovered part of your Sentiments and endeavoured in vain to conceal mine I had never lov'd any thing before any my Stars have decreed you should become agreeable to me yet do not think to take any Advantage from so sincere a Confession since I declare my Mind this time with a Resolution never to speak to you more but without having a desire to penetrate into the Cause I cannot help telling you the Fear I am in of being made a Sacrifice to another whom perhaps you might love better than me Oh Madam cry'd the Count in a Rapture judge better of a Man whom you have just loaded with your Favours and do not suspect Ingratitude from a Heart that bears your Image be assured a Person who sighs for you can never think of any other Object What have not I to fear reply'd she from the Lady whose Picture you so much esteem That shall never give you the least trouble said the amorous Count presenting it to her here it is keep it as an Evincement of my Fidelity  Felicia  was touched at so great a Proof of his Passion and express'd much Satisfaction in receiving it then desired him to retire apprehending that his being up so long might do him a Prejudice and whatever Violence he did his Inclinations he could not refuse obeying her  As soon as he was gone she reflected on all that had pass'd What  Leonida  said she are you not content with hearing a Declaration which you ought to have declin'd but also have owned to a Stranger that you could love him You who are engag'd to the Prince of  Carency  can you be so easily captivated and weak enough to confess your Affection for another You have already shown your Jealousy which is a certain Proof of a violent Passion what Judgment will the Count form from such a Behaviour You are going to lose his Heart and become a disgrace to your Sex Oh unfortunate Creature what must you do to attone for a Fault which seems of so high a Nature These Thoughts gave her the deepest Concern and her Face was bathed with Tears when  Beatricia  returned but she took so much Care to hide them that they were not perceiv'd  The Count being retired to his Chamber pass'd his time the most agreeably in the World when he call'd to mind  Felicia  's Generosity but could hardly flatter himself with the Success he wish'd for Oh Love said he will you at last change my Pain into Pleasure and repair the Ills you have done me Amiable  Felicia  has heard me and protested I was not indifferent to her Heavens let us be for ever united that our good or ill Fortune may equally affect us Day began to appear before he could close his Eyes he rose and went to see  Felicia  who was alone in her Closet reflecting  on that which had rack'd her Imagination all Night She received the Count with much Civility but appear'd so melancholly that he knew not what to think of so great an Alteration What is my Crime Madam said he Have I done any think to incur your displeasure You seem unwilling to turn your Eyes on me Are you concerned for having given me Room to think myself the happiest of Men and do you already regret the obliging Terms you imploy'd Yesterday to banish my Alarms Alass continued he are you resolv'd to cast me at once into Despair by so cruel a Change No my Lord reply'd she looking at him with an Air that might convince him of the contrary I have us'd ineffectual Means to conquer those Sentiments I discover'd to you I wish I could see you with Indifference but I find it is not in my Power do not then be uneasy I alone ought to be so The Count transported with Love and Gratitude took  Felicia  's Hand and kiss'd it with all the Marks of Passion and Respect that could be express'd on such an Occasion  Beatricia  being informed they were together entered suddenly the Chamber they were in and surprized them just as the Count was kissing  Felicia  's Hand How strangely was she amaz'd at seeing this She chang'd Colour several times and her Eyes were animated with an uncommon Fire which they immediately perceiv'd tho' she endeavoured to conceal her disorder  Their Conversation turn'd on a general Subject and from that Hour she us'd all possible Means to prevent their entertaining one another in private These Proceedings extremely perplex'd the Count Divine  Felicia  said he to her one Day pity my Sufferings and consider how severe a Law I am forc'd to impose on myself when I silence a Passion which I have had the good Fortune to render agreeable to You What Authority has your Sister to lay so cruel a Restraint on you I see her Uneasiness my Lord reply'd  Felicia  and to show the Confidence I have in you I will own to you she is not my Sister nor even related to me I would have let you sooner into the Secret had I found a favourable Opportunity Oh Madam How obilging is this Declaration reply'd the Count and what Reproaches do I owe myself for not having acquainted you with the Circumstances of my Life The Hours I pass'd in your Company were so transient that I chose to imploy them in confessing the Power of your Charms We both of us have err'd my Lord reply'd  Felicia  in neglecting to inform each other of some particulars which are essential to our future Felicity yet if I may judge of your Heart by my own it had no share in this Omission and I promise to give you a faithful Relation of all that has pass'd from my Infancy You will then find it is not without Cause that I sigh sometimes and complain of the Rigour of my Fate but you must prepare your self to overcome  a great many Difficulties if you persevere in your Love for the unhappy  Felicia  Oh Madam reply'd he no Difficulties can ever alarm me I have Love and Courage to assist me and if you espouse my Interest all Things will be easy to me But said she suppose I were contracted to another what would you do At these Words the Count changed Colour What do you tell me Madam cry'd he contracted Oh Heavens To what Misfortunes am I doom'd Do not afflict your self my Lord reply'd she I am yet Mistress of my Destiny can you think I would receive your Addresses if I had an Inclination for any other No such a Proceeding would render my Heart unworthy of you These Assurances gave some Ease to the Count's Mind who was just going to express his Satisfaction to his charming Mistress when  Beatricia  came and troubled them with her Presence  Her Jealousy was now increased to such a degree that she was even distracted when she saw them speaking to one another and assoon as she was alone she abandon'd herself to the most violent Despair I am not belov'd said she and I flatter'd myself that I had inspired the Count with such Sentiments as would have been agreeable to me but he is entirely devoted to  Felicia  He adores her and she triumphs over my Weakness What do I say continued she after having reflected some time perhaps if he were acquainted with the Motions of my Soul he would act  another Part Ah why did I not declare my Thoughts to him and why should I accuse him of being the Cause of my Torment since he does not know the Indisposition I am in I must either inform him of what I feel or resolve to see him constant in his Passion for my Rival  After having pass'd the greatest part of the Night in Reflections of this Nature she rose early and sent to the Count desiring he would meet her in the Garden This unexpected Message gave him some Uneasiness notwithstanding he obey'd her Orders and as soon as she saw him her Mind almost chang'd in relation to the Subject that induced her to send for him He ask'd her obligingly what were her Commands to which she answered in these Terms your health My Lord is so perfectly recovered that I fear we shall lose you soon and as I have some reason to be convinced our Company is not indifferent to you I take this occasion to assure you how pleas'd we should be to see you remain here yet I cannot help saying I have endeavoured in vain to discover whether my Sister or I have the Precedency in you Affections perhaps this Question may show my Indiscretion but I believe you a Man of too much Honour to leave me in an Uncertainty therefore let your Inclinations determine in favour of either of us I will do you all the Service in my Power and if you make me your Confidant it shall no ways lessen my Friendship for  you The Count who was above any dissimulation express'd much Pleasure at the Opportunity she gave him to declare his Sentiments Nothing can be more generous than your Proceeding Madam said he and I should be unworthy of your Goodness if I did not repay it with Sincerity I am in Love it is true and you would have been the Object of it had I not feared my Passion might offend you Young  Felicia  has captivated my Heart and I conjure you to favour me in my attempt on hers I shall in return show my Esteem and Gratitude to you for so considerable a Service  Beatricia  at these Words was Thunderstruck and would have fallen down at his Feet were it not for a Tree that stood by which supported her she made a vain Effort to conceal her Grief her Colour chang'd and the Tears which ran from her Eyes discovered part of her Sufferings to the Count who said many obliging Things to her by way of Consolation and protested he would for ever do his best Endeavours to serve her but all he could say was not capable of giving her Satisfaction Love requires Love and it is an offence of the highest degree to offer any other thing in Return  About this time Don  Fernand Benavidez  who was innocent of the Crime laid to his Charge having no more  Leonora  for his Enemy began after the Death of this Favourite to be heard in his Justification he wrote the particulars to  Casilda  and withal that he was  in hopes of being soon set at Liberty after which he would immediately go to see  Leonida  This she kept secret till she had penetrated into the Sentiments of the Count but when she found all her hopes were destroy'd she thought of nothing but tormenting these happy Lovers in their Amour What said she shall I suffer this ungrateful Man to be bless'd with the sight of my Rival and omit acquainting my Brother with an adventure wherein he is so much concern'd He doats on  Leonida  whilst she loves the Count of  La Vagne  and is equally belov'd My Brother and I without doubt must be the Victims of their Passion and he will load me with eternal Reproaches for having admitted so dangerous a Stranger into his House I must sacrifice him to my Revenge for what can I expect from his Cruelty My Sighs and Tears had no Power to move his Pity and since nothing can prevail with him I will punish his Barbarity I have but this Remedy left and cannot flatter my despairing Soul with any other relief  Having tormented her self with these confused Thoughts she wrote a Letter to her Brother wherein she gave him the Particulars relating to what she knew of the Count of  La Vagne  telling him at the same Time that he had conceiv'd a Passion for  Leonida  who return'd it with Sentiments so obliging that she believ'd it wou'd be impossible to disengage them unless he took very secret Measures  Benavidez  was strangely affected with  this News which he receiv'd the Day the Queen had order'd his Liberty What said he to the Gentleman who had accompany'd the young Ladies to his Castle have I depriv'd the Prince of  Carency  of the Possession of this excellent Creature to yield her to the Count of  La Vagne  I thought I had conceal'd her in a Place so retir'd that she wou'd have escap'd the most penetrating Spy yet the Cruelty of my Fortune has so contriv'd it that she shou'd find in that solitary Forest one of the handsomest Men in the World expiring and prevent his Fate by making his Preservation her Care which I fear has rob'd me of  Leonida  's Heart My Confinement cost the Prince his Life whose Generosity engag'd him to make his Addresses to  Leonora  with the only View of procuring my Liberty By what Fatality continued he does the Count of  La Vagne  live Is not he the same whose Death  Olympia Daria  so much deplor'd that her Grief terminated her Days Has he so little Gratitude after loving a Mistress who died for him to make a second Choice Her Impression ought to have been everlasting but I will punish his Inconstancy to her and his new Passion for  Leonida  who has made me already commit too many Crimes to leave my Felicity imperfect I must give some Ease to my bleeding Heart by depriving this too happy Rival of his Life These violent Reflections were follow'd by many others for he thought that if he kept  Leonida  longer at his House as Chance  had made her acquainted with the Count of  La Vagne  a like Accident might expose her to the sight of some Persons who knew her and wou'd inform Don  John  of her Retreat  Love and Jealousy wou'd not permit him to stay any Time at  Villa Real  he had no sooner seen the Queen and return'd her Thanks for his Liberty but went privately to  Porto Real  in order to dispose every Thing for the carrying off of  Leonida  to  Morocco  where he was sure to be in high Esteem having several Relations of great Distinction in  Barbary  He there made an Agreement with a Captain of a Ship then went to his Country Seat but stop'd first in the Forest and sent for his Steward to whom he gave a Letter to  Casilda  with Orders to deliver it into her own Hands he was not long expecting an Answer for he saw her coming with the Man he had sent  Benavidez  went up to her and after having embrac'd her tenderly sought for the most conceal'd Place to entertain her And here they took Resolutions so contrary to the Felicity of the Count and  Leonida  that it had like to have depriv'd them of their Lives Oh how far were they from foreseeing their Misfortune since at this Time they were making Protestations of eternal Love and little thought that  Benavidez  and his Sister were proposing Means to disappoint them  Casilda  told her Brother she had sufficient Reason to be convinc'd that the Count's Addresses to  Leonida  were favourably receiv'd I will cross their Passion interrupted  Benavidez  with a furious Air I am resolv'd to seize on  Leonida  and carry her to  Morocco  you shall go with us but before we part I must sacrifice the presumptuous Count of  La Vagne  to my Resentment What Brother cry'd she almost distracted will you not be content to possess your Mistress without my going with you to a Place for which I have so great an Aversion I do not intend to do any Violence to your Inclinations said he in making you this Proposal but I suppose the same Motive which invited you to abandon the Count and enter into this Retirement may engage you to go elsewhere nevertheless Sister you are under no Constraint The only thing I desire you will do for my Satisfaction is to contrive a Way for me to be hidden this Night in the Count's Chamber that I may have the Pleasure of striking a Heart that dares adore  Leonida  Suspend your Design Barbarian interrupted  Casilda  in her first Transports I am as little able to hear you as second your Cruelty the Count's Life shall not be in your Power till your have taken away mine What do you say Sister cry'd  Benavidez  extremely surpriz'd I can hardly believe what I hear Is it possible that you love this Stranger and have already forgot  Hinriquez  Are you destin'd ever to make Choice of ungrateful  Men remember how your first Lover treated you and what you are to expect from this Do you imagine that after having a Passion for  Leonida  and being belov'd by her he can change his Mind in favour of you This is very disobliging reply'd  Casilda  but I hope every thing and flatter my self with his Love if he sees her no more Seize on her fly with her and leave me here with him Will it be consistent with your Honour to stay alone with the Count said he What will the Count think of it if once it is known at  Villa Real  They will think nothing to my Prejudice reply'd she the Count must be mine or I retire into a Monastry so that I shall have but little Reason to be concern'd at the World's Opinion whether good or ill Fortune attends me Do you consider Sister said  Benavidez  that your Affection for my Rival may put him hereafter in a Condition to dispute  Leonida  with me I wou'd have shown his Corps to her defac'd with Wounds and her hopes being destroy'd by his Death she wou'd easily consent to make me happy What an Error it is reply'd  Casilda  to suppose that so horrid a Scene cou'd introduce you into her Favour she wou'd ever reproach you of the greatest Cruelty yet if you believe his Death will serve your Designs say you have kill'd him tho' its uncommon to boast of such a Fact were it even true  Benavidez  perceiving his Sister lov'd the Count too passionately to consent to so cruel  an Action in Compliance to her as well as out of fear of her making any Discovery wou'd no longer insist upon it To show my Affection for you dear  Casilda  said he I submit to your Pleasure only oblige me in being secret He had brought with him three Men devoted to his Interest who he was sure cou'd carry off  Leonida  without being discover'd therefore having taken effectual Measures with  Casilda  the Design was soon executed to his Satisfaction  That Evening his Sister invited  Leonida  to take a Turn in the Park and by degrees led her into an Alley which convey'd them towards the Forest till at last Night coming on and  Leonida  hearing a Noise was going to retire when she was seiz'd by  Benavidez  and his Men In spite of the Fright she was in she endeavour'd to disengage her self from them and having sufficient room to believe it was a Plot against her she cry'd out repeating several Times the Count of  La Vagne  's Name and call'd him to her Succour but alas he did not suspect his  Felicia  was in danger who was carry'd off and gone a great way before he heard of her or his own Misfortune  Casilda  took care the Count shou'd know nothing that Night of what had pass'd to prevent his pursuing her Brother but sent to him the next Morning and desir'd he wou'd come into her Apartment having an Affair of Consequence to communicate to him As soon as he enter'd her Chamber she affected to be  melancholy There is no Friendship said she but Love can dissolve You were Witness my Lord of that between  Felicia  and Me She is not my Sister I must confess yet I never cou'd have imagin'd she wou'd abandon me in such a manner Read this Letter which she left on her Toilet it was just now deliver'd to me you will find it equally regards us The Count in taking it express'd as much Uneasiness as if he had known it to be a Messenger of ill News it was written in these Terms  THE Affection you have for your Brother and your Fears of exposing him to any Danger were the Motives that hinder'd me from acquainting you sooner with his and my Design You certainly wou'd have oppos'd it had you known I am going away with him this Night I cou'd wish Sister your Love for me wou'd invite you to come to us at  Jaën  you may assure your self I shou'd be overjoy'd to see you and hear that your Sentiments for the Count of  La Vagne  have met with a kind Return I leave him with you so hope you will have no Cause hereafter to complain of his Indifference As I have a particular Esteem for him I desire you will inform him of what you know concerning my Affairs that he may be convinc'd it is no more in my Power to dispose of my Heart and remember my dear  Casilda  that if I made my Resolution a Secret you ought to forgive me since Faults of Love deserve rather Pity than Anger  This fatal Letter threw the Count into such an Agony that he was like a Man who felt the Tortures of an approaching Death he turn'd pale and all his Senses abandon'd him  Casilda  who was prepar'd for this dismal Scene took care that speedy Assistance shou'd be given him and by the Help and Force of Remedies he soon came to himself he open'd his Eyes and seeing several Persons about him made Signs to them to withdraw which they obey'd and left  Casilda  with him in the Chamber He look'd at her some time without being able to utter one Word at last having recover'd his Speech he said in a feeble Accent It was unkind in you Madam to acquaint me with the greatest Misfortune that cou'd ever happen to me No my Lord interrupted  Casilda  I do not deserve a Reproach it is but reasonable you shou'd be inform'd of  Felicia  's Sentiments after what she has done for  Benavidez  Who is this you name the Prince suddenly reply'd I name Don  Fernand Benavidez  my Brother said she and the Lady who went here by the Name of  Felicia  of  Leon  is  Leonida  of  Velasco  her Father had contracted her to the Prince of  Carency  who is highly distinguish'd by his eminent Birth and personal Merit but having conceiv'd a tender Affection for my Brother she preferr'd this Retirement to the Court and wou'd not wait the unwelcome Arrival of a Person to whom her Father had destin'd her We came away together from  Villa Real  and ever since she  has continued a mutual Correspondence with my Brother her going away with him last Night is an Evincement of this Truth The Prince at these Words broke out into so passionate a Grief that it wou'd have mov'd the most inhuman Heart with Pity O cruel Fortune cry'd he will you never cease to persecute me Was it then  Leonida  I saw and to whose potent Charms I yielded only to make me more wretched through her Inconstancy The ungrateful Fair betrays and flies me and that dear Friend too that same  Benavidez  for whom I sacrific'd my self he is the Man who has impos'd on my Credulity he is in Love with the Woman to whom I am promis'd and the Traitor describ'd her to me as a Monster to make me conceive an Aversion for her Is this all the Reward I must expect after having ador'd  Leonida  and so entirely lov'd  Benavidez Casilda  was in the greatest Astonishment imaginable to hear the Prince express himself in these Terms She easily understood by his Discourse that he was the same Prince of the House of  Bourbon  whom the Count of  La March  his Father had contracted to  Leonida  but her Surprize was the greater because she thought the Prince not finding  Leonida  at  Villa Real  was return'd to  France  and as she knew nothing of his Adventure with  Leonora  she cou'd not well conceive by what Accident he had been attack'd in the Forest and why he had chang'd his Name These different Circumstances wholly employ'd her Thoughts  The Prince on the other side cou'd not moderate his Grief he was like a Person depriv'd of his Senses what with Sighs Tears and Menaces no Man ever appear'd in a more deplorable Condition  What need you my Lord said she express so much Concern for  Leonida  She never lov'd you you see she has prefer'd  Benavidez  and forgets even the Rules of Modesty to follow her Lover Why then will you suffer so much for an ungrateful Woman who merits not your Consideration Oh Madam cry'd the Prince I know not what I do my Despair is so great that I am no longer Master of my Reason my Misfortunes are not to be comprehended I find my self betray'd by a Person who was contracted to me from her Infancy and by a Friend to whom I had confided the Secrets of my Soul  Leonida  who seem'd to approve my Passion has deceiv'd me and added Contempt to her Ingratitude she knew I ador'd her yet the perfidious Fair receiv'd my Vows only to sacrifice them to another Just Heaven revenge me of this perjur'd Beauty But what do I say continued he a Moment after I have not Resolution enough to wish her the Punishment she deserves She is dear to me in spite of all and I will do my utmost Endeavours to regain her Oh I love her and love her to Distraction The Force of my Resentment must fall on the Traitor  Benavidez  his Blood shall attone for the Affront I have receiv'd You might do what you say my  Lord interrupted  Casilda  if  Leonida  lov'd him less but you have sufficient Cause to believe by the Letter she left and his Flight that she is now marry'd to him They are gone together to  Jaën  Don  Alonzo  who is Governor of that Town and my Brother's Uncle approves his Passion for her and will protect him Believe me then the Design you form is impracticable Do you think  Benavidez  wou'd have made such a Step without taking all necessary Measures for it Don  John  of  Velasco  is one of the greatest Men in  Spain  and my Brother knowing his Power has carry'd her to a Place where he defies his Enemies His Precautions interrupted the Prince will be ineffectual against me I neither fear Danger nor Death and if I revenge my Wrongs I shall die with Content  Live my Lord reply'd  Casilda  blushing Oh live for me since my Passion for you is transcendent Think with what Pleasure I receiv'd you into this House and tho' your Retributions were no Ways equal to the Greatness of the Favour yet nothing cou'd prevent the Fatality of my Destiny which not only forces me to love you but even deprives me of my Peace and Liberty Ah my Lord can Sentiments so tender make no Impression My Fortune is great and my Family one of the first in  Castile  then let our Hearts be so united as we may be for ever happy I will leave my Friends and Relations to follow you to the utmost Bounds of the World While  Casilda  was thus declaring her Mind to the Prince and flattering her self with Success he walked distractedly up and down the Chamber with his Arms cross'd taking so little notice of her Discourse that he neither look'd at her nor made any Answer but like a Man in a violent Passion was leaving the Apartment without knowing what he did or where to direct his Course  Casilda  who cou'd not bear the Thoughts of losing the Prince had no longer Reason in her Words or Actions but ran and stop'd him with her Face drown'd in Tears Will you go Barbarian said she What will you fly me and abandon a Woman that adores you to follow perfidious  Leonida  Leave her with my Brother despise her and to compleat your Revenge even forget her since by her Behaviour she has render'd her self unworthy of your Love My Quality is equal to hers and what I have superior to her is my Constancy But what do I see Oh Heavens cry'd she looking at him with what Ingratitude am I rewarded You leave me to expose your self to the greatest Dangers youShe was going to continue her Discourse when the Prince interrupted her What wou'd you have me do Madam said he Can I love any thing but  Leonida  and were I capable of a Change cou'd it be in Favour of the Sister of  Benavidez  Ah do you deprive me even of Hope which is not deny'd the most Unfortunate reply'd she shedding a Shower of  Tears where Fury had no less a Share than Love but inhuman as you are don't think to live in Peace with your Cruelty I will find means to torment you and make you repent the little Regard you have to my Sufferings  The Prince did not stay to make any Answer to  Casilda  whom he left in her Chamber without either Strength to follow him or Power to speak a Word but was meditating on several violent Designs being divided between Love Jealousy and Despair  After this Scene it is not to be imagin'd the Prince wou'd remain in  Benavidez  's House He resolv'd immediately to go to  Carmona  where he thought he might hear something concerning  Leonida  and as that Town was in his way to  Jaën  which was the Place mention'd in her Letter to  Casilda  he was in hopes by a strict Enquiry to discover the Road  Benavidez  had taken With this Design he set out but cou'd not help complaining of the Adversity of his Fortune Can I ever flatter my self said he with the Possession of a Heart that has so inhumanly betray'd me What Motive cou'd induce  Leonida  to act in so deceitful a manner Was it only to sacrifice me to  Benavidez  No I cannot harbour such injurious Thoughts of one who appear'd so modest and virtuous Then calling to mind that she had told him she was engag'd Why cruel Creature said he as if he were speaking to her why did not you entirely confide in me  You are engag'd it's true since I am the Man to whom you are contracted We shou'd have known each other and perhaps you might have lov'd me but instead of acting sincerely you have carry'd your Perfidiousness to an Extremity You listen'd to my transcendent Passion and flatter'd me with a Return only to make my Despair proportionable  Had his Distraction been of a more moderate Nature it is probable he wou'd have apprehended farther Consequences from the Fury and Resentment of  Leonora  for as yet he was not inform'd of her Death besides he had no mind to go to  Seville  for fear of seeing the Count of  La March  his Brother to whom he wou'd be oblig'd to relate his Adventure with  Leonida  and the Error she had been guilty of which he cou'd not resolve being of a generous Temper and incapable of saying any thing to the Prejudice of a Lady he lov'd so entirely  These Obstacles at another Time wou'd have embarass'd the Prince but in this Conjuncture they did not in the least affect him for his Thoughts were wholly imploy'd on the Measures he shou'd take to recover his dear  Leonida  He arriv'd at  Carmona  and tho' in a  Spanish  Dress was presently known to be a Foreigner by the Fairness of his Complexion and Colour of his Hair he carry'd in his Countenance such Marks of Melancholy that no Body cou'd see him without Concern The Governour of that Place was soon acquainted  with his Arrival and as he had receiv'd Orders from Court not to let any Stranger pass that Way without Examination hearing he was a Person of Quality and a Foreigner out of a Compliment he paid a Visit to the Prince who receiv'd him with so much Politeness and Grandeur that after a short Conversation and many Offers of Service the Governour invited him to accept of an Apartment in the Castle  The Prince return'd his Civility in a most obliging manner and desired to be excus'd because his Affairs wou'd not permit him to stay above one Night at  Carmona  but the other unwilling to be deny'd repeated his Importunities and with much Difficulty persuaded him to comply with his Request  A noble Entertainment was prepar'd in the Castle for the Prince who cou'd not suppress his violent Chagrin which the Governour perceiv'd but wou'd not enquire into the Cause He understood by his Discourse that his Design was to go to  Jaën  and as he had a Son who commanded a Company in the Citadel of that Place and whose Name was Don  Gabriel d'Agular  he told the Prince very obligingly that if he approv'd of it he wou'd write to him in order to acquaint him with his Arrival there and added that if it were in his Son's power to serve him he was satisfy'd he wou'd neglect no Opportunity of expressing his Readiness  This free and gallant Behaviour of the Governour engag'd the Prince to accept his Offer  with the same Freedom He knew no Body at  Jaën  and as he wanted the Assistance of some Person in whom he cou'd confide to enter privately the Citadel where he thought  Benavidez  and  Leonida  were retired he the more willingly embrac'd so favourable an Occasion The next Day having made his Acknowledgments to the Governour for his extraordinary Favours he took Leave of him and left  Carmona  but not without acquainting Don  John  of  Velasco  with what had pass'd that he might act on his side for the Recovery of  Leonida  Never was Surprize greater than that which his Letters caus'd at Court for Don  John  and his Lady were persuaded the Prince had been kill'd by  Leonora  's Assassins One may imagine how great was their Joy when they heard Heaven had preserv'd him yet it cou'd no ways alleviate their inexpressible Grief for the Loss of their Daughter They immediately thought of means to get her away from  Jaën  where they believ'd she was but whilst the Prince is on his Journey thither let us see what becomes of unfortunate  Leonida  As soon as Don  Fernand Benavidez  had brought her out of the Park he sat her on Horseback before him and held her with such Force that all the Efforts she made to disengage herself were in vain She cry'd out and implor'd Heaven and Earth for Succour She call'd the Count of  La Vagne  to her Assistance but her Cries and Tears had no Power He  led her through uncommon Ways over Mountains and Rocks where the Ecchoes answering her Complaints rather augmented her Sorrow than lessen'd it  Whoever you be said she to  Benavidez  you are the most unjust of Mortals to use this Violence with me I never gave any One Cause to treat me after so cruel a manner Why will you take Pleasure in disturbing the Peace of my Life By what Authority do you act thus If my Father has sent you I am dispos'd to obey his Orders without being under the Necessity of travelling all Night with a Troop of Men as if I were a Criminal Oh let us stop continued she seeing he made no Answer I conjure you carry me back to the Place where you found me you need not apprehend my Escape since I am alone there with a young Lady whose Brother is now Prisoner at  Villa Real  and were he at Home he has too great a Respect for my Family to oppose my Father's Commands Here her Tears interrupted her Complaint and forc'd her to be some time silent She began to be persuaded these Men were come to take her away by the Order of Don  John  who she thought had been inform'd of the Place of her Retreat and of the Count of  La Vagne  's being there She tenderly regretted the Absence of her Lover If he knew said she to herself where they are carrying me I shou'd have less reason to be uneasy for certainly he wou'd soon find means to see me His Birth and  Merit are sufficient Recommendations to intitle him to my Father's Favour who being once convinc'd of the Aversion the Prince of  Carency  and I have to each other wou'd undoubtedly consent to break off the Match and yield me to the Count Thus she travell'd all Night entertaining herself with Reflections of this Quality  As soon as  Aurora  display'd her gilded Beams  Leonida  endeavour'd to know the Person who was carrying her off But Heavens cou'd any surprize be equal to her's when she saw it was  Benavidez  At first she had not power to speak her Tears prevented her Utterance whilst a Thousand different Ideas presented themselves to her Mind She at last cry'd aloud no longer doubting of her Misfortune are you become my Enemy Don  Fernand  you who offer'd me your House to conceal me and in whom I had that Confidence Do you thus break through the Laws of Hospitality and force me away in this mannerDon't accuse me unheard Divine  Leonida  said he interrupting her my Passion for you wou'd never have shin'd had you been destin'd to the Prince of  Carency  by your own Inclination as you are by the Will of your Parents I saw with delight the Birth of your Aversion for him which flatter'd me that after procuring you a Retreat from the Persecutions of your Father whose Authority and Resentment are not to be oppos'd your Justice wou'd oblige you to turn your Eyes on me and incline you to  think I was not so ardently devoted to your Service without loving you to Distraction but whilst I was an unfortunate Prisoner depriv'd of all that cou'd give me Pleasure you were entertaining the Count of  La Vagne  whose Life you had sav'd I was inform'd of his Passion for you and of the favourable Reception you gave him What were all my Pains and Cares design'd for this Stranger and did I expose myself for no other reason but to procure him an Opportunity of declaring his Love to you Was there ever a Destiny more unaccountable I conjure you Madam to cease tormenting your self you have no just Cause to grieve It is not your Father's House you regret neither is it the Prince of  Carency  since your Disdain for him is so great that you chose rather to quit the Court than see him but you sigh for the Count of  La Vagne  his Absence occasions all these Tears what Madam ought you not to prefer me to him Do me Justice suspend your Resentment and you will approve my Conduct Ah cry'd  Leonida  your Offence is too great you have behav'd yourself like a Traytor and you must expect nothing but my Hatred and that of my Family If it be true you love me as you say you do use other means to gain my Favour Restore me my Liberty and let me have the disposing of my Destiny you may afterward dispute your Title to me with the Count and deserve by your Services that Precedency which you apprehend  I give him You have one Advantage he has not which is my being already under some Obligations to you and so far I acknowledge my Gratitude therefore I wou'd not have you forfeit the Esteem due to so peculiar a Merit but don't think you shall ever prevail with me by Force or by a disrespectful Behaviour your present Conduct is a sufficient Motive to render you odious to me yet upon Condition you will obey me I am willing to forget your Offence and pardon the Rashness of a Passion which perhaps you were not Master of  I penetrate into your Thoughts too well Madam reply'd  Benavidez  to let my self be deceiv'd by a Discourse you wou'd not have made me had you been at Liberty to declare your Sentiments The Count has an indisputable Advantage over me he has had the good Fortune to acquire your Favour but as for my part you ever look'd on me with all the Indifferency imaginable Your Words bear more Policy than good Nature and your Heart speak's for my Rival besides do you think me credulous enough to believe your Anger can be so easily appeas'd No I ought not to run the hazard of losing a Treasure I have already in my Possession Therefore Madam for my Passion's sake pardon my not complying with your Request resolve to be mine since by that means you can render me the happiest of Mankind I will go with you to any part of the World You shall be Mistress  of your Destiny and mine then I will obey you for ever  Ah Barbarian cry'd  Leonida  in a mournful Accent I wou'd sooner sacrifice a Thousand Lives if I had 'em than consent to be yours It is not without reason you suspected my Words I had no other Design in speaking to you as I did but that of retrieving my Liberty and flying you as the cruelest of my Enemies I see nothing can deceive a Man who is too great a Master of Dissimulation not to dive into the Thoughts of others You may easily judge that as my Aversion for you is infinite so is my Resentment of the Injury you dome but you shall not glory long in your Treachery I had rather cast my self into the Arms of Death tho' never so dreadful than live with you yes I can find the Way to die and in dying meet with too great a Felicity in my despairing Condition  Having spoke these Words with much Anger and Emotion she wou'd not say any more nor even look at him tho' he us'd his utmost Endeavours to appease her This was the deplorable State she was in when  Benavidez  embark'd with her at  PortoReal  in order to sail for  Morocco  which Passage was then very dangerous because the  Spaniards  having lately defeated the King of  Tunis  's Fleet the  Barbarians  were so enrag'd that they swore they wou'd be reveng'd and give no Quarter to any  Spanish  Vessel  Leonida  was hardly embark'd when a handsome young Lady came o her in a respectful  manner her Features were very regular and her Countenance so sweet and agreeable that  Leonida  tho' her Grief was inexpressible fix'd her Eyes on her with a secret Pleasure Her Name was  Inea  she was Daughter to the Captain of the Ship and shew'd an extraordinary Desire to be serviceable to our Distressed Fair in her Affliction I am extreamly oblig'd to you said  Leonida  to her for the Concern you express but I beg you will give yourself no farther Trouble The Condition I am in neither lets me seek nor wish for Relief Oh leave me to my Despair since nothing but Death can ease me I have no Design to displease you Madam reply'd  Inea  but I think my self under an Obligation to serve you in all that lies in my power I can easily perceive your Trouble is exceeding and that your Thoughts are entirely imploy'd on some great Disaster but I am persuaded we ought never to dispair since the cruelest Fate may receive a favourable Change Charming  Inea  interrupted  Leonida  having heard her Name I am almost without hopes We are bound for  Africa  and the Traytor who has forc'd me away is carrying me into a Kingdom where he has great Power Alas who is it that will come to my help Neither my Relations nor Friends know any thing of my Misfortune no body is acquainted with it but a Woman who is even as perfidious as himself These Words made her call to mind  Casilda  and so fatal a Remembrance occasion'd her to shed a  rent of Tears O Traytress said she as if she were present what have I done to you to deserve this from your Hands 'Tis you that help'd your Brother to carry me off and by your wicked Contrivance I am now come to this Disgrace You have ill rewarded the Affection I had for you I hardly suffer'd the Count of  La Vagne  to make Professions of Love to me because I knew you had a Passion for him and cou'd I have dispos'd of his and my Destiny I wou'd not have given you the least Uneasiness You had no such generous Sentiments for me it was by your means your Brother knew the Affection I had for this Stranger and at a time that you pretended you were not deceiving me by your false Caresses you drew from me all my Secrets which you have ungratefully abus'd and only sought my Ruin by such a Discovery She pronounc'd these Words with a Passion justly inspir'd and thought by unloading her Mind she might give some Ease to her overburthen'd Heart  Benavidez  flattering himself with a successful Voyage whenever he spoke to  Leonida  entertain'd her with his Passion and said he hop'd that as she saw a Necessity of submitting to her Fate she wou'd consent to make him happy This Discourse she heard with Contempt and had so little Regard for his Sighs Tears and Menaces that she never turn'd her Eyes on him but was thinking how she cou'd escape the Hands of her Ravisher which she  wou'd have couragiously done by chusing Death had not the Sentiments of Religion oppos'd so cruel a Resolution As  Benavidez  knew his Presence was odious to her he seldom appear'd but was in hopes time wou'd make an Alteration in his Favour and propos'd as soon as they were arriv'd at  Morocco  to find means to make her obey him if he was not fortunate enough to render himself agreeable to her  The Wind being fair they soon reach'd the Streights of  Gibraltar  and enter'd the  Mediterrean  where having sail'd some time the Seamen shouted for Joy in seeing the Coast of  Africa  and did not doubt but they shou'd make the Land in a few Hours  Leonida  at this News lamented her unhappy State she went upon Deck and casting her melancholy Eyes over the vast Ocean I am looking into the Skies said she to  Inea  to see whether I can discover any dark Cloud or Sign of an approaching Storm I wish you were not with me in this Ship then shou'd I be the more willing to perish here But alas how calm is the Sea and how serene the Air We shall soon reach  Africa  and I have nothing left my wearied Soul but cruel Despair Her Head was leaning on one of her Hands and her Neck bathed with Tears that ran from her beauteous Eyes In this Posture  Inea  was endeavouring to give her some Consolation when suddenly she cry'd O Heavens here are too great Ships coming up to us under full sail how unfortunate shou'd we  be if they were Enemies These Ships belong'd to the Queen of  Fez  and had discover'd by the Flag of  Benavidez  's Ship that they were  Spaniards  which was a sufficient Motive to attack them War being declar'd at that time between the two Nations they came up to them and tho' there was a great Inequality of Force yet the Captain wou'd not surrender without fighting  Benavidez  seconded him in his Defence with all the Courage imaginable It distracted him to think he was going to lose a Person he lov'd more than Life and lose her in such a manner since it wou'd either be by his Death or her Captivity  These dismal Thoughts made him believe he shou'd have power enough to defend his Mistress you shall see this Day Madam said he whether I deserve to be preferr'd to the Count of  La Vagne  I will sacrifice the last drop of my Blood to deliver you from the Danger you are threaten'd with but if I dye Adorable  Leonida  remember I dye for you and that had not my Passion been the Cause I wou'd not have committed those Crimes for which I have incurr'd your Aversion  I don't think said she with an Air as full of Pride as Coldness that I am any ways oblig'd to thank you for what you are going to act in my Defence I cannot fall into Hands more barbarous nor more odious to me than your's  Benavidez  had no time to make her an Answer he can above Deck and did such Actions as one wou'd have though incredible had he  burn'd with a milder Passion but this brave  Spaniard  was not long able to sustain the overpowering Force of the  Moors  Those that cou'd have seconded his Courage were already wounded and as he was also pierc'd with Wounds he was forc'd at last to yield and let his feeble Body take Place among the Enemies he had just sacrific'd to his Rage  The young Prince  Abelhamar  who had just fought him admiring his Courage did not see his approaching End without some Concern he commanded that nothing shou'd be neglected to relieve him and was going to speak to him when he was inform'd that several Ladies were found in the Cabbin  Leonida  appear'd among them like a Queen in the midst of her Subjects he was surpriz'd at her superior Beauty and tho' Fear was still painted in her Face and her Eyes had less Power than usual yet her Charms had so great an Influence that the Prince from a Conqueror became almost a Captive  Benavidez  knew her tho' dying and made an Effort to rise and speak to her You are reveng'd Madam said he of an unfortunate Man who never could have been capable of displeasing you had not his Passion for you been proportionable to his Offence Don't envy me the Consolation of believing my Memory will not be odious to you and that the Loss of my Life may attone for my Crime  Leonida  mov'd at so melancholy a Sight and her own Condition together cou'd not restrain  her Tears I pardon you  Don Fernand  said she the Injury you have done me and was never cruel enough to wish your Death she said no more seeing his Eyes were closing and that Paleness had overspread his Face This new Scene of Misfortunes afflicted her extremely and gave her Room to fear the Danger which now threaten'd her was far greater than that she had escap'd She saw herself a Slave to the cruelest Enemies of the  Spaniards  and was well inform'd  Don John  her Father had once been a Terrour to those Barbarians which made her believe were she known her Captivity wou'd be the more rigorous  Whilst she was fill'd with these Reflections young  Abelhamar  look'd on her rather as a Divinity than a human Creature and tho' the Admiral commanded in Chief yet as Prince of the Blood he had all the Deference paid him that was due to his Quality He approach'd  Leonida  whom he address'd in a most obliging manner saying she shou'd have no Reason to deplore her Fate and promis'd to use all his Interest with the Queen of  Fez  to restore her to her lost Liberty He spoke  Spanish  very well and  Leonida  return'd him Thanks for the Compassion he shew'd to her Misfortune  Since the Condition I am in my Lord said she inspires you with Pity I beg you will let me know my Fate You shall be obey'd Madam reply'd  Abelhamar  as soon as you go on  Board the Admiral for the miserable Objects that present themselves to you here only increase your Melancholy he then gave her his Hand and conducted her on Board the other Ship  All the Women who were taken with  Leonida  follow'd her in hopes that by her means they might be delivered from the Captivity which threaten'd them As soon as she was in the Cabbin  Abelhamar  spoke to her in these Terms You seem uneasy Madam to know your Destiny were it in my Power I wou'd soon resign to you the Disposal of it and esteem myself happy in serving you I am sorry my ill Fortune obliges me to comply with the Admiral who I must inform you has given Orders for us to return to  Sallee  the Capital of the Kingdom of  Fez  where you will be presented to the Sultaness  Celima  This Princess is my first Cousin her Father had her brought up in a Castle by the Seaside and one Day as she was walking on the Shore attended only by her Women some Corsairs who were at a Distance perceiving her landed suddenly and finding she was very handsom took her and carry'd her to  Bajazet  who rewarded 'em considerably for their Present  This Emperor of the  Turks  in spight of his natural Haughtiness became distractedly in Love with this Princess whose Charms were so transcendent that she receiv'd the greatest Marks of Distinction from the proudest Prince in the  World  Celima  made her Father acquainted with her Fate who taking Advantage of the Influence she had over the Emperor prevail'd with him to lend him Men and Money in order to dethrone my Father who then possess'd the Crown by his BirthRight and the Laws of the Land accordingly he not only succeeded in the Enterprize but even depriv'd him of his Life and as my Youth cou'd give him no Apprehension he was contented with keeping me confin'd in his Palace  Bajazet  carried his Arms into  Missia  and took  Celima  with him who was Witness of the Advantages he gain'd over the  French  and  Hungarians  but this Prince's Fortune met with a strange Turn his Army was defeated by  Tamerlane  the Great and Himself taken Prisoner in the Battle  Celima  notwithstanding his Overthrow found Means to make her Escape and return'd to  Sallee  where her Father receiv'd her with Joy proportionable to her Merit some Time after he and his Son dying the Crown fell to this Princess who took effectual Measures to secure it It was thought at first she had a Design to marry me which wou'd have partly made Amends for the Wrongs I had suffer'd from her Family but she has solemnly declar'd against Marriage tho' Young and Handsome and the melancholy Life she leads makes People suspect she is affected with some deep Concern which cannot be attributed to the Captivity of  Bajazet  since she has often protested she wou'd  rather be the Last of his Slaves than the First of his Favourites she seldom sees any Company but has a great many beautiful Slaves which are brought to her from all Parts of the World and as she is extremely unwilling to restore them to their Liberty when she likes them I very much fear you will acquire so great a Share in her Favour that she will not part with you I wou'd prevent this Misfortune were she less absolute but she is so Jealous of my Actions that shou'd I release you it wou'd be sufficient to make her think me Criminal  Alas my Lord interrupted  Leonida  I am now too well satisfy'd I shall pass the rest of my Days in an unhappy Captivity yet I own the Danger I have escap'd from the Power of him that forc'd me away appear'd to me much more terrible  Abelhamar  desir'd she wou'd acquaint him with her Adventure which she related with all the Grace imaginable but conceal'd  Benavidez  's Name and her own telling him her's was  Felicia  of  Leon  and so disguis'd her whole Story after the same Manner  Leonida  having entertain'd him some Hours he order'd a Repast to be serv'd then retir'd leaving her with  Inea  who was lamenting the Misfortune she had receiv'd by the Death of the Captain of their Ship who had been kill'd in the Fight Oh Father said she Why have I lost You or Why did I not die with You What are become of all my Hopes They are vanish'd and the Remainder of my Life will  be a continu'd Scene of Misery I am now a Slave and dare not flatter my self with any Relief from my Relations who will never ransom me You were every Thing to me and your paternal Love was my only Joy Tho'  Leonida  's Troubles were great enough and she not in a Condition to comfort any One her Natural Generosity and Tenderness wou'd not permit her to forget  Inea  on so sad an Occasion She approach'd her and embracing her said my Dear  Inea  do not indulge your self in these Complaints you see I am as unhappy as you are yet bear my Misfortunes with more Resolution Ah Madam reply'd  Inea  you have less Reason to complain than I or more Courage to support you As to what regards me every Thing has contributed to load me with Torments my Father pierc'd with Wounds is represented to my afflicted Mind and by his Loss all my agreeable Hopes are for ever destroy'd What have I not done ye mighty Powers cried she to attempt this Voyage I had at last compass'd it and was flattering my self with Success but you see Madam how little we must depend on Fortune which binds me with Chains at a Time that I expected to enjoy a perfect Felicity In ending these Words which were often interrupted with Sighs she turn'd her Eyes on  Leonida  and seeing her Face was bath'd in Tears did not doubt but her Discourse had affected her which gave some Ease to  Inea  Alas how generous you are Madam  said she to share my Troubles I am so sensible of your Goodness that I wish nothing more than an Opportunity of giving you an Evincement of my Gratitude you have this Day gain'd a Heart Madam which shall for ever be at your Devotion The Compassion I have for you  Inea  said  Leonida  you well deserve and I protest to you I shall much less deplore my Misfortune if by its Means I acquire your Friendship We are Both of us Captives and as yet unacquainted with our future Destiny but whatever happens I hope we shall be together that we may tell our Pain to each other which is the only Thing can give Relief to the Unfortunate  These melancholy Reflections led her into Those of a deeper Nature to which she entirely abandon'd her self and continu'd weeping bitterly most Part of the Night then complaining she cried Why don't you come my Dear Count of  La Vagne  and deliver me from the Hands of our common Enemies Oh how agreeable shou'd I think such a Change of Fortune after so considerable a Service my Father cou'd not deny giving me to you and the Prince of  Carency  wou'd be overjoy'd at having escap'd a Marriage to which he had so great an Aversion But alas continued she How far am I from this happy State My Infelicity is real and I cannot acquaint you with it I know not in what Manner the Queen of  Fez  may treat me it's probable you will never hear of me and Death only will  terminate my Misery She would have pass'd the rest of the Night in these sad Repinings if  Inea  who was much troubled for her had not diverted her Thoughts Pardon me Madam said she for interrupting you and let me intreat you to take a little Repose They say we are to land to Morrow at  Sallee  Wou'd you appear before the Queen under so deep a Concern Our Dependance is on your Perfections and we believe her Majesty will be so pleased with you that by her Favour you may soon contribute to our Liberty But Madam were it only for your own sake preserve those Charms which I fancy have already touch'd Prince  Abelhamar  fine Ladies may expect every Thing from their Beauty  Oh  Inea  What do you tell me replied  Leonida  fetching a deep Sigh How different are your Sentiments from mine The unhappy Experience I have made of a violent Passion gives me too just a Cause to fear the like Disaster tho' if you consider well the Figure we shall make in the Court where we are going as being  Christians  we must rather expect to be slighted by those  Barbarians  and expos'd to their Cruelty but there is nothing I wou'd not prefer to the Misfortune of being belov'd by  Abelhamar  You imagin'd my Dear  Inea  that such a Conquest wou'd flatter my Vanity yet for my own Satisfaction I will sooner believe you misinterpreted his Meaning and thought what he acted out of Generosity proceeded from some other Motive however  since you desire it I will endeavour to take a little Rest in finishing these Words she embrac'd  Inea  and laid her self on the Bed  Love had already made a great Progress in the Heart of  Abelhamar  who was so taken with the Beauty of  Leonida  whom we must again call  Felicia  that the Thoughts of losing her when once presented to the Queen gave him much Uneasiness Is it possible said he to  Mula  who was his Favourite that I can deliver up this Divine Creature to the Power of my mortal Enemy Why has Fate order'd I shou'd be the Author of her Captivity How shall I after such a Conduct evince her of my Sentiments Will she not have Room to load me with Reproaches which must be succeeded by her Aversion He was now ruminating on a Thousand different Projects First he had no Mind she shou'd land at  Sallee  then he thought how he might carry her off at his Arrival there and after all wou'd thus examine himself From whence proceed these Motions Sure I am not in Love have I had Time to conceive a Passion for this Fair Stranger No no said he it is only the Effect of Surprize and Admiration which will have no farther Consequence and I shall forget her in ceasing to see her yet if she shou'd become dear to me continued he I can ask her of the Queen who I believe will not refuse me One Slave out of so great a Number  Celima  in making me a Present of this Young Lady whom I might have kept without her Consent  will think she highly obliges me and I dare assure my self she will be ready to give me such a Proof of her Goodness at a Time that I have Pretensions to greater Favours  This Opinion compos'd a little the Agitation his Mind was in but its Calm was not long Ah  Mula  said he it is not  Celima  alone can oppose my Good Fortune  Felicia  is the Person who must decide my Destiny Can I flatter my self that she is not already engag'd If she has an Inclination for any One in  Spain  I must not expect she will be favourable to me I shall appear in her Eyes as a Tyrant that forces her from the Arms of the Man she loves  Mula  us'd all Arguments to perswade him into a better Conceit of his Personal Merit but as in Affairs of Love the least Uncertainty is a cruel Torment he pass'd that Night betwixt Hope and Fear without taking any Resolution  At the first Appearance of Morning he grew impatient to see  Felicia  and hearing she was up went to her Apartment She receiv'd him with much Civility but seem'd extremely dejected which griev'd  Abelhamar  who us'd many tender Words to express his Concern After a short Conversation she beg'd Leave to go upon Deck he readily consented to her Request being desirous to embrace any Opportunity of obliging her and immediately order'd it to be spread with a Rich Carpet and Cushions of Cloth of Gold then conducted her to the Place that was prepar'd and sat  down by her under a Magnificent Canopy They were some Time without speaking to one another for  Felicia  having turn'd her Looks towards the Coast of  Spain  cou'd not forbear melting into a Flood of Tears which threw  Abelhamar  into so deep a Melancholy that he had no Power to interrupt her At last she recover'd a little from that Excess of Grief and broke Silence The Respect that is due to you my Lord said she ought to make me conceal my Affliction in your Presence but your generous Compassion hinders me from laying so great a Violence on my Spirits I must let my Sorrow take its Course since it is the only Relief I can expect in my deplorable Condition Here forc'd away from my Friends my Country and a considerable Fortune I am suddenly become Slave to a Queen who perhaps will not grant me my Liberty at any Rate Alas my Lord Is there no Means left to deliver me from this Misfortune The Prince no longer Master of his Passion flung himself on his Knees and taking her Hand Divine Stranger said he judge better of your transcendent Charms You are not yet arriv'd at  Sallee  and 'tis in your Choice not to go there at all I adore you amiable  Felicia  for it is impossible you shou'd not inspire something more than Love If such Sentiments merit your Favour here I lay my Fortune at your Feet do not disdain the Vows of a Prince who in Right ought now to be King of  Fez  Oh that I had a Crown in my  Possession I wou'd place it on your Head if you thought me worthy of wearing it with you yet I have some Friends left and a Sanctuary to go to Come Madam then let us away so that I possess you all my Ambition will be satisfy'd Ah my Lord said  Felicia  interrupting him do not follow the Dictates of an Infant Passion which may cause you to blush hereafter consider you are speaking to a Christian Captive who has Gratitude and Generosity enough not to accept Offers which might occasion your Ruin I am indebted to you it's true yet think what I owe to my self It wou'd be impossible for me to consent to go with you without being the Author of your Disgrace and my eternal Shame The Difference of our Laws and Religion the Inequality of our Fortunes and our little Knowledge of each Other all These oppose such a Design and shou'd I leave my self to your Care you your self wou'd tax me with the greatest Imprudence Continue Madam replied  Abelhamar  with Impatience and rather say you love some Person in  Spain  Say cruel Creature you have an Aversion to me which is the only Motive of your Consideration Ah  Felicia  How easily might we overcome all these Difficulties were you inspired like me with a tender Passion And how little wou'd you reflect on the Consequences of an Engagement which flatters us with so perfect a Felicity But alas I see too well you prefer the Queen of  Fez  's Chains to that Liberty  I now offer you Here leaning his Head upon his Hands he silently express'd his Pain with Sighs that prevented his Utterance  Felicia  continued speaking to him with much Sweetness and Prudence but soon forgeting he was near her she relaps'd into her former Affliction at the Thoughts of her unhappy Destiny They were Both in this Situation when the Admiral who at a Distance had observ'd them some Time approach'd the Prince and ask'd him whether he was dispos'd to Eat Who having recover'd from the little Disorder he was in made Answer it shou'd be as  Felicia  pleas'd This beauteous Lady blushing said to him You do not reflect my Lord that I am a Captive here who alas has no Command Ah Madam reply'd he speaking to her in a low Voice you know too well the unlimited Power you have whereever I am and no Body feels the Effect of it more than I If your Empire is so great in Misfortunes what wou'd it be at another Time In ending these Words they were interrupted by the joyful Shouts of the Seamen who had just discover'd the Coasts of the Kingdom of  Fez  which News struck  Felicia  with Consternation for whilst she was at Sea she had some Hopes that either a Tempest wou'd arise and cast them upon the Coast of  Spain  or that the  Spanish  Fleet which was then Abroad wou'd retake 'em but she was too well assured that being once landed at  Sallee  she cou'd not any more expect to be reliev'd  Abelhamar  on his Side thought Death less terrible than parting with this Young Lady whom he wou'd soon be oblig'd to yield up to the Sultaness and as he had not much Time to remain with her he employ'd those Hours in representing his Passion to her in the softest Language Love and Respect cou'd inspire but she receiv'd his Addresses with so much Coldness that he began to despair of meeting with an obliging Return  They were now arriv'd at  Sallee  and as  Abelhamar  cou'd not resolve to go himself and present  Felicia  to the Queen of  Fez  he told the Admiral he was indispos'd therefore desired he wou'd excuse him to her Majesty for not waiting on her He approach'd  Felicia  at the same Time and said it's you Madam that hinders me from making my Court to Day for I cannot attend you to a Place where you go with so much Reluctancy but be assured that in Spite of your Indifferency I shall not omit any Thing to deliver you from your Confinement You are too generous my Lord reply'd she in endeavouring to contribute to my Satisfaction which will be purchas'd very dear if it shou'd hereafter give you the least Chagrin  Abelhamar  retired exceeding melancholy and soon after  Felicia Inea  and the Rest of the Slaves were set on Shore by the Admiral's Command in order to be sent to the Queen Alas my dear  Inea  said  Felicia  looking at her with a dejected Air we see our selves  going into Captivity and till now the civil Treatment of  Abelhamar  prevented us from feeling the full Weight of our Misfortunes This Prince now leaves us and the fine Palace we see is to be our Prison At these Words she cou'd not restrain the Course of her Tears and  Inea  kept her Company in this dismal Scene till they alighted at the first Court of the Castle from whence they were immediately carry'd to the Queen  They found her seated on a Carpet of Gold beautify'd with Diversity of Colours and round her were several embroider'd Cushions enrich'd with Pearl she was dress'd in a  Turkish  Habit of Silver Brocade Flower'd with Crimson and Button'd with Diamonds and Emeralds her Girdle which was set with Precious Stones girded a little Poigniard to her Side Part of her Hair was tuck'd under a Muzlin Veil strip'd with Gold and the rest hung in Tresses down her Neck her Eyes which were Large and Black tho' languishing shin'd with irresistible Lustre but in her Mein was painted so much Pride and Haughtiness that it rob'd her of Part of her Charms and render'd her awful to All that approach'd her  Leonida  attended by the Women who were taken with her came and flung her self at the Queen's Feet who thought her a surprizing Beauty she chose her and  Inea  to be of her Chamber and gave the rest to the Admiral to dispose of as he pleas'd The Queen knew  Leonida  was a  Spaniard  by her Dress  therefore speaking to her in that Language ask'd her Name and to what Part of the World she was going when they took her to which she answer'd her Name was  Felicia  that a Gentleman had run away with her who told her he intended to carry her to  Morocco  but that he had been kill'd in the Engagement and she thought her self too happy in her Misfortunes to fall into the Hands of so great a Queen She finish'd these Words with so weak an Accent that  Celima  easily perceiv'd she was under a great Affliction She extremely pity'd the Youth of this Lady whose noble Air perswaded her she was of Eminent Birth Be under no Concern  Felicia  said she to her I shall extend my Goodness to you there are greater Troubles than those you are to undergo in this Palace You must not judge of Felicity by Appearances and I know not after enquiring into your Condition and that of some Sovereigns I have heard of but your's is more Happy for I believe added she your Heart has prefer'd its Liberty being uncommon for One at your Age to receive an Impression of Love  Leonida  made no Reply but looking on the Ground chang'd Colour and fetch'd a deep Sigh  Celima  who only spoke to her in this Manner to discover the Motions of her Heart observing her Disorder perceiv'd she was touch'd with a secret Passion but did not take any farther Notice of it  A little after the Governess of the Slaves order'd  Felicia  and  Inea  to follow her to that  Part of the Palace assign'd for their Use where she made 'em change their Cloaths and as they were to wait on the Queen she gave them very rich Stuffs for their Dress They generally went Bareheaded with their Hair falling negligently on their Shoulders and as a Mark of Servitude wore Golden Bracelets and Chains on their Arms when they attended the Queen to any Place they had large White Veils of an extraordinary fine Stuff which cover'd their Head and Part of their Face  Felicia  appear'd as beautiful in this new Apparel as in that she had just put off and her Actions were accompanied with so much Grace that nothing seem'd strange to her They carried her into a Room where they were teaching the Slaves to sing and play upon Instruments which surpriz'd her extremely not expecting to see so great a Number of Handsom Creatures as if  Celima  had the Privilege of choosing them out of all the Courts in the Universe These Captives show'd no less Admiration in seeing  Felicia  they all came up to salute her and amongst them she observ'd a young Lady whose Air was so Majestick and Charming that she took a particular Delight in looking at her but what increas'd her Attention was the Fancy she had to have seen her somewhere before and that she was not unknown to her They express'd an extraordinary Civility to each other and as there is generally a greater Sympathy between unfortunate  Persons than others these Two Fair Captives mutually contracted a particular Friendship  From thence  Felicia  in her new Dress was carry'd to the Queen but made no Stay in her Apartment Soon after  Abelhamar  forgetting he had desired the Admiral to make his Excuses to  Celima  for not paying his Court to her that Night ran impatiently to the Palace and seem'd extremely uneasy when he perceiv'd  Felicia  was not with her He did not presume to mention any Thing concerning her but the Queen saluted him in these Terms You have brought me a lovely  Spaniard  whom you shall see presently in her Slave's Dress I am perswaded you will not think her less beautiful than before and I must tell you I have learnt since your Departure that she who was taken in the Island of  Sardinia  is the Daughter of  Brancaleon Doria  her Name is  Olympia  andhere she is continu'd the Queen seeing her enter the Apartment she will inform you of something particularly surprizing  Celima  commanded her to entertain the Prince with her Story which she obey'd and  Felicia  coming in at the same Time approach'd  Olympia  who began the ensuing Relation  A young Count extremely Handsom and of a Merit so shining that he was universally admir'd fell in Love with me I made him no disobliging Return thinking my Father wou'd be very well satisfy'd to give me to a Person  of his Quality and one who had highly distinguish'd himself in the World His Consent my Lord was the only Thing wanting to make us Happy but alas we little foresaw the Difficulties that oppos'd our Desires  My Father displeas'd with this Nobleman's Family look'd on him and all his Relations as Enemies however for a long Time his politick Reasons oblig'd him to conceal his true Sentiments which he discover'd when my Marriage was propos'd to him it was then we knew with mortal Displeasure that Time only cou'd relieve us we both labour'd under all the Vexation that such a Disappointment was capable of giving us and as our Affection daily increas'd we cou'd not deny our selves the Satisfaction of private Interviews my Father was acquainted with our Proceedings which being opposite to his Inclinations made him so angry that he told me in the greatest Passion he wou'd revenge my Disobedience to him on the Object I lov'd These Menaces caus'd me to tremble for this young Lord whom I conjured to absent for some Time and soon after a glorious Occasion invited him to go Abroad  Bagazet  had conquer'd a great Part of the  Levant  and the King of  Hungary  endeavouring to beat him our of it apply'd himself for Succour to most of the Princes of  Europe  who readily sent him all possible Assistance Tho' I consider'd this to be a long and tedious Journey and even apprehended all the Dangers the Count might  be expos'd to yet through the Necessity of his Absence I seconded the Desire he had of going to  Missia  We exchang'd Vows of eternal Constancy to each other and the Grief we felt at parting I thought wou'd have cost us our Lives The Event of the Campaign was very unhappy the Christian Troops were defeated and the Count taken Prisoner which News I heard with a Concern not to be describ'd I sent him Money to pay his Ransom and was expecting his Return with the last Impatience when I receiv'd an Account of his Death It is hard my Lord to imagine how cruelly such a Loss affected me I cou'd no longer restrain my Sorrow I persecuted my Father with Reproaches and wou'd not permit either my Relations or Friends to see me I thought Life it self insupportable and beg'd of Heaven to shorten its Date that I might be eas'd of the Torment I then endur'd  This was my melancholy Condition when slumb'ring one Night my Mind fill'd with my Misfortunes I suddenly awak'd and saw a Person near me whom at first I took for the Shade of my Deceas'd Lover Such an Apparition wou'd have terribly frightened me had my Passion been less violent I found afterwards by his Discourse that far from being with a Phantom I had Cause to believe he was the same lovely Man so dear to me At this Sight I abandon'd my self to all the Joy that cou'd attend such a Surprize and shew'd  to this Cavalier all possible Marks of Affection he was cruel enough not to undeceive me and I was not sensible of my Error till the Day following when by Chance my Father brought him into a Grotto where I had retir'd to indulge my self with the pleasing Thoughts of the Count's being restor'd to Life  I was then inform'd this Gentleman whom I had taken for him had never seen me before which sensibly touch'd me I was so asham'd of this Mistake that my Affliction had like to have put a Period to my Days My Father was extremely mov'd at my Condition and as I knew his Sentiments I did not doubt but he wou'd oblige me in any Thing I desir'd therefore embracing the Occasion I conjured him in most pressing Terms to give out that I was Dead and permit me to go to my Mother who was then in  Sardignia  which he readily assented to I had not far from  Cagliary  an Aunt who was Abbess of a famous Monastry that lay in a Wilderness near the SeaSide where I intended to end my deplorable Life conceal'd from the Sight of any Object that might renew my Sufferings  My Father notwithstanding the Chagrin this Separation gave him dispos'd every Thing for my Departure and the News of my Death was spread Abroad without any One's thinking it suppos'd I immediately left  Genoa  and my Voyage had nothing Remarkable in it for I soon arriv'd in  Sardignia  where my Mother receiv'd me and without Deliberation  consented to what I so much wish'd She carry'd me to her Sister who was the Depository of my Secrets and having chang'd my Name I led a Life so retir'd that without being of the Number of the Dead I cou'd not be reckon'd amongst the Living but I us'd often to be alarm'd with Letters from my Father pressing me to quit my Solitude in order to return Home which made me apprehend he wou'd use his Authority to compel me to it therefore I went and flung my self at my Aunt's Feet and conjured her to give me the Nun's Veil that having once made Vows my Relations might lose the Hopes of my returning again into the World  She at first oppos'd my Request believing she ought not to make such a Step without the Advice of my Friends but at last my Prayers and Tears prevail'd on her She desir'd the Bishop of  Cagliary  to perform the Ceremony and as it is the Custom in that Place for the Person who takes the Habit of a Novice to go with a Number of young Ladies to hear the Prelate in a little Chappel by the SeaSide I went out dress'd in a long Gown Brocaded with Silver my Hair hanging loose on my Shoulders and my Head crown'd with Flowers my Companions were also dress'd in White and in this Manner we form'd a Procession along the Shore  It's now said I my Dear Count that I am going to sacrifice to you the rest of an unhappy Life which was destin'd to be your's  Were you sensible in the Region where you are of what I do for you in this World you wou'd rejoyce to have inspir'd me with such Sentiments I was lost in these Thoughts when I heard a great Noise the Cries of my Companions oblig'd me to look behind me where I saw several Men following us with their Swords drawn I endeavour'd to make my Escape but two of them being come up to me carry'd me off with some of the young Ladies and having forc'd us into a Boat row'd immediately up to their Ship where we were under Sail before any one cou'd come to our Assistance  One may easily imagine that such a Surprize terrified us extremely but it was nothing to the inexpressible Grief which seiz'd us when we found our selves in the Hands of a  Corsair  of  Algier  neither our Prayers nor Tears had Power to soften him all his Thoughts were fix'd on making the most of our Captivity He soon lost Sight of  Sardignia  and after having taken other Prizes steer'd his Course towards  Sallee  being sure to sell some of us to the Queen who was pleas'd to chuse me as you know my Lord out of a Motive of Pity for I was so very melancholy that none cou'd see me without Compassion  It never came into my Head to acquaint my Father with my Captivity nor did I wish the Recovery of my Liberty which I was going to offer as a Sacrifice when the  Corsair  took me It was equal to me to be shut up in the Palace of  Sallee  or in a Monastry since I had  no other Desire than that of leaving the World and passing the Remainder of an unfortunate Life without any Engagement  In this State were my Affairs and I daily receiving new Favours from the Queen when a Merchant of  Genoa  who deals in Jewels came to this Court Her Majesty being desirous to see what valuable Things he had to dispose of sent for him and I was near her when he enter'd the Apartment He no sooner cast his Eyes on me but seem'd astonish'd for he did not doubt of my being Dead as it was reported yet in seeing me he had Cause enough to believe I was  Brancaleon Doria  's Daughter since he had spoken to me too often at my Father's House not to know me again and as he immediately perceiv'd I knew him it so confirm'd his Opinion that he desir'd Leave to speak with me which he obtain'd of the Queen Is it possible Madam you shou'd thus neglect Writing to your Friends who so infinitely love you and are lamenting your Death at  Genoa  whilst you are Living and a Slave at  Sallee  Who bemoans me said I with a melancholy Accent Do you believe that after the fatal Destiny of a Person who was dearer to me than Life I cou'd find any Relish for the World No as my Passion was great so was my Sorrow and no other Motive induc'd me to spread Abroad my pretended Death only to retire into some Solitude and there forever regret the Loss of a Man I so dearly lov'd In finishing these Words I burst out in Tears  and the Jeweller fixing his Eyes on me with Admiration you deserve a better Fate Madam said he and I esteem my self happy to have met with this Opportunity of assuring you the Gentleman you actually deplore did not perish as it was related he arriv'd at  Genoa  a little after the Report of your Death at which he was so touch'd that his Trouble is not to be describ'd he admitted me to see him often but his Grief wou'd seldom allow him to speak and whenever he broke Silence it was with your Name he afterwards fell dangerously ill and as soon as he recover'd went to Travel but he is now return'd to  Genoa  and I can give you Testimonies Madam of his eternal Love  We were in a Place pretty distant from the Queen who cou'd not hear our Conversation but I was so transported at this News that without knowing what I did or considering why I ran and flung my self at her Feet at first I was not able to speak my Eyes gush'd out with Tears and I look'd at her in so moving a manner that she ask'd me several times what was my Request The Merchant being a Man of Sense came up and explain'd the Meaning of my Disorder and as I had time to recover my self during their Discourse Ah Madam said I to the Queen I entreat your Majesty to give me my Liberty I am now willing to live and wish my self at  Genoa  since my Misfortunes are at an end No Creature was more wretched than I and now none is more happy I protest to you Madam I daily saw  the Light with Pain having as I thought lost the only Person that cou'd make my Felicity and desir'd Death to terminate my Miseries as it had done his I cannot call to mind all I said to the Queen who was pleas'd to hear me with a great deal of Condescension and being inform'd who I was as a particular Proof of her Esteem for my Family she restor'd me to my Liberty for which I return'd her Majesty repeated Thanks I ask'd the Jeweller a great many Questions and desir'd he wou'd procure me Conveniencies for my Passage in the next Ship that shou'd sale for  Genoa  but after having made more serious Reflections I thought it prudent not to put my self into my Father's Power till I had first consulted the Count and taken Measures with him to succeed in our mutual Desires without running any Risque of meeting with new Obstacles  After these Considerations I wrote to him by the same Merchant who is return'd to  Genoa  in order to bring him here This is my Lord what has pass'd during your Absence which the Queen commanded me to relate to you  Abelhamar  thank'd her Majesty and afterwards  Olympia  for whom he had always shown a particular Value You have no reason now to complain Madam said he to her  Hymen  is going to reward you for all the Pains Love has made you suffer You'll soon see the Object of your Affection and unite your Destinies Ah how happy is such a State In ending these Words he sigh'd and look'd languishingly  at  Felicia  who turn'd her Eyes on the Ground fearing they shou'd meet his he also endeavour'd to speak to her but she carefully avoided his Approach This Proceeding so deeply affected the Prince that he retir'd almost in Despair The Queen who was troubled with a secret Uneasiness went into her Closet to indulge her usual Melancholy and the Slaves repaired to their Apartment  Felicia  finding  Inea  in her Chamber embrac'd her with as much Pleasure as if she had not seen her of a long time We have said she illustrious Companions in our Servitude that fine Creature they call  Olympia  is Daughter to the famous  Doria  I have just now heard her Story which she related to Prince  Abelhamar  Oh Heavens my dear  Inea  how worthy of Envy is her Fate she will soon see her Lover whose Death was so surely believ'd that after his Loss she determin'd to sacrifice the Remainder of her Life to Solitude if you ever have felt a tender Passion you may imagine how agreeable such a Meeting will prove to them Her Eyes already shine with an unknown Lustre and express the Motions of a satisfy'd Mind Alas continu'd she how different is her Case and mine I conceive Madam interrupted  Inea  your Uneasiness does not proceed entirely from your Captivity were I permitted to say more I shou'd judge your Heart was concern'd in the Sighs and Tears which sometimes you cannot restrain Relieve your self in complaining Madam and if you  think me worthy of being your Confident I dare assure you I shall never forfeit that Honour by divulging your Secret I am persuaded of your Sincerity my Dear reply'd  Felicia  and think my self happy to have met with a Person in whom I can confide but if I relate my melancholy Story to you I hope you'll oblige me with a Recital of yours and believe what I desire does less proceed from my Curiosity than the particular Interest I have in all that concerns you I flatter my self with what you are pleas'd to say lovely  Felicia  reply'd  Inea  and to shew how obedient I am to any thing you command I will now give you a Relation of my Misfortunes  The Story of  Inea  I Am born of a noble Family of  Andalusia  where my Father had a good Estate and marry'd a Lady who brought him no Fortune he was ever thought a gallant Man and being bred up to the Sea from his Infancy the King gave him a Ship of War he has left two Daughters my eldest Sister's Name is  Mathilda  who is very handsom We us'd to see but little Company according to the Custom of  Spain  but my Father having receiv'd into his House a young Gentleman of a distinguish'd Family in  Toledo  whose Name is Don  Ramire  of  Castro  a secret Sympathy dispos'd his Heart and mine to receive Impressions for each other I was pleas'd at his gentle Air his Wit and  soft insinuating manner which engaged me unawares and we were not long acquainted before he declar'd I had inspir'd him with the tenderest Passion  He thought himself happy in wearing my Chains His Fortune and Merit gave him such Advantages that he had no room to apprehend any of my Friends wou'd oppose his Felicity and I was of the same Opinion for tho' I resisted the Infant Inclination I had for him it proceeded only from the fear I had of its not being sincerely return'd How unfortunate shou'd I be said I to my self were my Affection plac'd on a Man who might receive it with Indifference I ought before it's too late resolve to fly and deny my Eyes the Pleasure they take in seeing him The just Diffidence I had of my own Merit oblig'd me to be very reserv'd to Don  Ramire  and behave my self in a manner quite opposite to my Sentiments which inclin'd him to believe I had conceiv'd an Aversion for him this Thought did not only afflict him but made him so timerous that he had not Power to speak to me I examin'd all his Actions with great Care and when we were together he appear'd extremely pensive I attributed this to the weak Impression I had made on him which created in me much Uneasiness and I did the greatest Violence to my self in not showing my Concern but tho' our Minds were prepossess'd yet our Eyes meeting sometimes cou'd not help confessing the inward  Motion of our Hearts Ah too indifferent Don  Ramire  thought I if you are really touch'd in what manner wou'd your Looks express it since without being so they speak the soft Language of Love He told me afterwards he had conceiv'd the same Idea of me and discover'd in my Eyes something which wou'd have flatter'd him had I not given him too many Instances of my Insensibility  My Sister pass'd some time in studying our Looks and was endeavouring to know whether we had a Passion for each other having her self a secret reason to be inform'd of the Truth all the Care she took serv'd only to perswade her there was no Love between us and that she might undertake what she pleas'd without Apprehension Don  Ramire  appear'd as agreeable in her Eyes as he did in mine but the Difference of his Proceedings with her was very remarkable It came into his Head first to acquire her Friendship that afterwards he might make her his Confident and so by degrees engage her in his Interest Thus one may see how blind is Love in some of his Projects for there was very little Probability that  Mathilda  wou'd act in such a Character She was my Mother's Favourite as my eldest Sisster had a Right to be married before me therefore Don  Ramire  being the only Person who then seem'd desirous to make an Alliance with our Family it was thought but just she shou'd have the Precedency  I was not long before I discover'd her Intentions and my Uneasiness met with so vast an Addition that it had like to have thrown me into Despair What said I complaining of my Fate am I already jealous I who can hardly tell what it is to love and must I feel a thousand different Pains which ought to be unknown to one of my Age Methinks I cou'd approve his Passion were he dispos'd to like me yet I have avoided him with the same Caution I wou'd have done the Man I hate was ever Conduct like mine My Sister is taking Advantage of my Timidity she is belov'd and in spite of that I still harbour such Sentiments as ought to make me blush since they will render me the unhappiest Creature in the World  Don  Ramire  whose Perplexity of Mind was not inferior to mine cou'd no longer be silent and as  Mathilda  gave him all Opportunities of entertaining her one Evening as they were walking together in one Ally of the Garden and I in another unknown to them and at too great a Distance to hear what they were saying I perceiv'd he was talking to her with a great deal of Emotion at last I saw him fling himself at her Feet and taking her Hand kiss'd it so ardently that I no ways doubted but he had just declar'd his Passion to her which meeting with an obliging Reception occasion'd those Transports in him Oh Heavens what a Sight was this to a Person in my Condition I wou'd no longer observe  them but went into an Arbour at the end of the Ally not having Strength enough to support me nor Power to resist the Course of my Grief  There I threw my self on the Ground leaning my Head on a Bench and covering my Face with my Veil I shed a Shower of Tears Oh how cruel is my Destiny said I Don  Ramire  and  Mathilda  love each other she has heard his Declaration and given him a favourable Audience for which he made his Retributions to her on his Knees and I can never flatter my self with the Hopes of being dear to him Here my Sighs and Tears made me perfectly asham'd and I was as mad at my own Sensibility as at his Indifferency but had I known what was passing between him and my Sister I shou'd have had as much reason to be pleas'd as I thought I had for the contrary  In fine Madam after a Conversation that turn'd on different Subjects Don  Ramire  urged by the Violence of his Pain deliver'd his Thoughts to her in the following Manner Charming  Mathilda  I must intrust you with a Secret on which depends the Peace of my Life be pleas'd to hear me and let me find in you those generous Dispositions that may contribute to my future Happiness As she believed he was going to disclose a Secret to her wherein she was chiefly concern'd she thought fit to keep him under such a Restriction as not to allow him too much Liberty  You ought Sir answer'd she to discover your Pain to a Person of more Wit than me I have not Experience enough to give you any Advice and there are certain Things I do not desire to know Be assur'd Madam interrupted he I have too great a Respect for you to say any thing that could give you the least displeasure moreover you have nothing to fear since you are not interested in this Affair I am only going to tell you I have a Passion for  Inea  whom I adore I hope my Success from your good Offices and conjure you to grant me your Favour in this Request In finishing these Words he flung himself at her Feet and his Thoughts were so entirely taken up with what he was saying that he took no notice of the different Emotions which appear'd in her Looks All that Rage Shame and excessive Love cou'd make one feel join'd at once to torment her You love my Sister said she after being some time silent and you chuse me for your Confident without considering that as I am the eldest my Fortune must be settled before hers I am so offended at the Injury you do me that were I more revengeful than I am I wou'd instantly punish your Indifferency Go Sir continu'd she speak to her your self I shou'd render you but a very ill Office with that she left him and no Man was ever seen in a greater Confusion He walk'd some time in the Ally reflecting on what had pass'd and was now convinc'd  Mathilda  having discover'd her  Weakness to him wou'd leave no Art unpractis'd to disappoint his Passion for me  Don  Ramire  perplex'd with these Thoughts came into the Arbour where I told you Madam I had retir'd and was not a little surpriz'd to find me there As for my Part I knew not what Resolution to take whether to go or stay when he put himself on his Knees by me and intreating me to hear him Adorable  Inea  said he the Condition I am reduc'd to does not permit me to be any longer silent I cannot doubt of your Aversion since you not only debar me of your Conversation but even turn your Eyes from me I have us'd all possible Means to decline a Passion which I fear will displease you But as the Torment I endure is little inferior to Death whatever Usage I am to receive from you hereafter only think I daily die for you  I cou'd not imagine Don  Ramire  reply'd I you were so capable of Deceit but your Conduct convinces me of the Truth You try in vain to perswade me This Dissimulation is worse than the Offence and I know what I am to depend on Go Sir I am resolv'd never to see you nor speak to you more Ending these Words I ran from him in spight of his Endeavours to prevent me and left him with an Air so full of Pride and Anger that he told me since he had like to have expired on the Place His Despair was so great that being retired to his Chamber he was taken ill with a violent Feaver which oblig'd him to keep his Bed  The mean while I went into my Closer where being alone I abandon'd my self to a thousand cruel Reflections Were I only to contend with  Mathilda  thought I there wou'd still be hopes of obtaining some Advantage over her but the Case now is such that shou'd Don  Ramire  yield his Heart to me methinks I wou'd reject the Offer He is a Traytor who tells me he has Sentiments for me which he has not He says the same to my Sister and loves neither of us at least I have cause to complain since he chuses me for the Subject of his Raillery Oh what Fatality deludes me to love this perfidious Man I fear he knows the Affection I have for him which is a Misfortune I cannot bear These Thoughts forc'd a Flood of Tears from my Eyes whilst I endeavour'd to banish him from my Heart and I was thus depress'd with Sorrow when my Mother sent for me I went down to her Apartment and appear'd so dejected that my Sister who examin'd every Motion of me did not doubt but I was come from Don  Ramire  's Chamber and that his Illness was the Occasion of my Melancholy tho' at the same time I knew nothing of the Matter nor wou'd I enquire after him thinking he did not deserve so great a Favour therefore I return'd to my own Chamber again without hearing his Name once mention'd  Mathilda  persisting in her Love for Don  Ramire  told my Mother the Conversation they had together in the Garden and desir'd she  wou'd be favourable to her in laying her Commands on me to use him with so much Indifference as might destroy his Hopes of ever attaining to my Affection This my Mother promis'd her and all she cou'd wish on that Subject The next Day I heard the Condition he was in who little thought I had the least Concern for his Illness tho' I must confess it gave me much Uneasiness and Compassion soon took place of my Anger yet I wou'd not go to see him whatever Pain I suffer'd in denying my self that Satisfaction  Ah how great is my Misfortune cry'd I not to have Pride enough to suppress a Passion which so immoderately disturbs my Mind and yet have so much Resentment as to deny my self the only Pleasure this World can give me How is it possible I can be so cruel to a Person whose Idea is never absent from me and whose Life I wou'd purchase with my own  By this time his Feaver was so violent that the Physicians were of Opinion nothing but his Youth cou'd save him I was in my Mother's Apartment when they came to acquaint her with the Danger he was in saying they believ'd him very near leaving the World At this News I was so seiz'd with Grief that all I cou'd do was to reach my Chamber where I fell in a Swoon and continu'd so almost an Hour  I had with me a young Servant called  Tereza  who lov'd me entirely and as she was no Stranger to my Affection for Don  Ramire  she  help'd me to conceal the Despair I was in No cry'd I when I was a little recover'd I cannot let him die spite of his Ingratitude I find the Preservation of my Life depends on his Heavens continu'd I bath'd in Tears shorten my Days and give Health to Don  Ramire  for alas without him what can I expect but unconceivable Pain I protest to you Madam I said a thousand distracted Things the Recital of which wou'd tire you for sure no Sorrow was ever equal to mine I was thus tormenting my self when my Mother came into my Chamber and her Presence so surpriz'd me that I had like to have related to her the Subject of my Grief She had just been with Don  Ramire  who conjured her in a most pressing Manner to let me favour him with a Visit adding that after so great a Satisfaction he shou'd contentedly die She told him any thing he desired shou'd be granted then came to prepare me for this Interview telling me how I shou'd behave my self Don  Ramire  said she is so near Death that what I am going to enjoyn you I believe is unnecessary yet that I may have no Cause to reproach my self I command you  Inea  to show him all the Indifferency possible in case he speaks to you of his Passion I shall obey your Orders with Pleasure Madam reply'd I tho' I am persuaded if he intended an Alliance in this Family he never had a Thought of me You make an unseasonable Declaration interrupted  my Mother in a severe Tone for I know he loves you to Distraction and it was very imprudent in him to chuse your Sister for a Confident as being your eldest she ought first to be provided for besides it's my Will pray tell Don  Ramire  so and that I had rather see you dead than his Wife  My Mother spoke to me with so much Heat that I cou'd not dispute the Truth of what she said I presently comprehended her Meaning and instead of a Traytor as I thought him before I now found he was a Man of Honour and the constantest of Lovers This no ways soften'd my Pain for tho' I was overjoy'd to know his Passion was sincere yet on the other hand I saw my self at the point of losing a Person I then esteem'd worthy the Sentiments I had for him and my Alarms continually persuaded me nothing cou'd mitigate so real a Misfortune The Impatience I had to see him wou'd not permit me to say much to my Mother I left her and took  Tereza  with me to Don  Ramire  's Apartment which I had hardly enter'd and approach'd his Bed when he turn'd himself towards me and reaching out his Hand said in a weak Voice Come Madam come and receive the last Breath of a Man who never sigh'd for any one but you tho' your Injustice accus'd my Heart with Deceit The State you see me in ought to convince you there never was a Passion more perfect It's for you I die adorable  Inea  continued he pressing my Hand it's you alone  who is the Cause and since it was my Fate not to deserve your Esteem I think my self happy not to survive your Aversion In finishing these Words he look'd at me with Eyes drown'd in Tears and fell into a deep Silence which I did not presently interrupt being either in Disorder or pleas'd to hear him mention a Passion I began to believe and was willing to approve At last I spoke to him Cease to reproach me Don  Ramire  said I cease to complain and think only of recovering I am unfortunate enough already and did not want this last Stroke to compleat my Ruin Must I lay aside the Modesty of my Sex and in spite of Shame confess I love you Oh consider what a Sacrifice I make you when I own those Sentiments I have so long endeavour'd to conceal I thought you had an Inclination for my Sister which gave me much Uneasiness all your Civilities to her I us'd to attribute to Love and what very much increas'd my Torment was the Action you did some Days ago when you flung your self on your Knees before her in the Garden I concluded you were entertaining her with your Passion which made me retire to the Arbour where you found me in order to indulge my Grief that was the Cause of my upbraiding you but now Sir you may be satisfy'd for I have punish'd my self severely and you are sufficiently reveng'd In finishing these Words I burst out in Tears and this Gentleman who before cou'd searcely  speak cry'd aloud with Transports of excessive Joy Ah charming  Inea  why was my Happiness so long unknown to me I was just going with my Despair to end my Life but since you have deliver'd me from the Arms of Death I am resolv'd to live and live to serve you alone Here I interrupted him to acquaint him with my Mother's Intentions which he protested he never wou'd comply with I represented to him the Necessity there was to affect an Inclination for  Mathilda  in order to carry on our Amour the more successfully He told me his Honour wou'd not suffer him to act such a Part and that he thought it more prudent to speak directly to my Father concerning our Marriage but as I knew my Mother's jealous Humour I was satisfy'd such a Conduct wou'd highly offend her and that no Scheme wou'd succeed so well as a feign'd Passion for my Sister which Opinion I at last persuaded him to approve  I cannot deny you any thing Madam said he since my Life is your's Dispose of my Destiny as you please I am devoted to your Commands In short Don  Ramire  promis'd me to make his Addresses to my Sister in such a Manner as might incline her to believe he design'd to marry her As soon as I left his Chamber I went to my Mother and told her what he said on that Point which pleas'd her extremely and as for my Sister nothing could equal the Joy she express'd at so agreeable a Change  We us'd every Day to visit  Don Ramire  during his Illness and whenever I was alone with  Mathilda  I constrain'd my self to exaggerate the Affection he had for her which I really repeated so often that sometimes I was afraid I spoke the Truth Thus we manag'd Affairs till he recover'd and my Family looked upon him as  Mathilda  's Votary About this Time the Governour of  Porto Real  whose Daughter had been newly marry'd gave an Entertainment with a Ball at Night to all the Nobility of that Place We were invited to this Assembly which was much greater than any we had ever appear'd at before Don  Ramire  who was to be of the Party express'd some Uneasiness at my going thither fearing my Charms as he told me wou'd create him many Rivals Indeed tho' I had no extraordinary Conceit of my self I cou'd not condemn his Jealousy but rather approv'd it and thought I had Reason to return him the same Compliment We said a great deal on that Subject till at last I took it into my Head not to go there at all and was meditating on some Stratagem to favour my Design when my Mother sent to let me know she was ready and only waited for me I immediately went to her but first made Don  Ramire  promise me whatever happen'd he wou'd not leave the Ball till he saw my Mother and Sister Home again  We all went together to the Governour's Don  Ramire  gave his Hand to my Mother  who was follow'd by my Sister and as for my part just as I step'd out of the Coach I designedly fell down and pretended I had sprain'd my Foot so that I cou'd not appear at the Ball My Mother displeas'd at this Accident which she did not know to be a Counterfeit sent me Home and Don  Ramire  stay'd with them very much surpriz'd at what I had done being sensible it was a Sacrifice I made him he had not Resolution enough to stay by  Mathilda  during all the Entertainment but took an Opportunity whilst she was dancing to go and place himself in a Corner of the Room and there wrote to this Effect on his Tablets  WHAT Torment does your Absence give me adorable  Inea  Here you leave me expos'd to the Smiles of a Woman I hate How do you think it possible for me to be complaisant to your Sister when you are not by As soon as you were gone my Thoughts like your Shadow follow'd you Alas this Moment absent from you Who is more unhappy than I And how fortunate shou'd I think my self were I paying Homage to your beauteous Eyes  Mathilda  who was naturally uneasy not seeing Don  Ramire  by her look'd every where for him and at last perceiv'd him Writing on his Tablets She went and took him out to dance the  Sarao  which you know Madam was invented by the  Moors  every Cavalier leads his  Lady with one Hand and carries a Torch in the other My Sister as she was dancing found it easy enough to take his Tablets away unknown to him The Dance being ended she went aside in order to examine them You may easily judge at reading what was wrote in 'em how enrag'd she was to find her self thus betray'd and the Preference given to me having so good an Opinion of her own Merit as to believe it wou'd have insured her from this Misfortune  Nothing cou'd be equal to the violent Passion she was in yet during the Ball she endeavour'd to conceal it and what help'd her most to dissemble was that to do her Justice as she is very amiable Don  Sanche  of  Gusman  Son to the Governour who was a fine Gentleman but extremely vain address'd himself particularly to her and she thought she cou'd not have a better Opportunity to cure her Passion and be reveng'd of Don  Ramire  than giving a favourable Reception to this Cavalier therefore she immediately gave him to understand my Mother wou'd be willing he shou'd visit us Altho' we are not fond of Company said she yet Sir your distinguish'd Birth and Merit intitle you to a Privilege others cannot pretend to This Invitation highly pleas'd him inasmuch as he had already declar'd his Passion for my Sister and cou'd not well expect a Return unless he were admitted to pay his Devoirs to her  Mathilda  prepar'd my Mother to receive him but did not mention the Adventure of the Tablets she only told her that as she was not very sure of Don  Ramire  's Heart a Rival might give him some Jealousy and induce him to conclude a Marriage he daily seem'd to decline While she was studying Means to satisfy her Revenge Don  Ramire  acquainted me with the Loss of his Tablets which he fear'd were fallen into the Hands of my Sister Tho' I take little Notice of her Behaviour towards me said he I observe within these few Days she treats me with an affected Civility I cannot well penetrate into the Cause nor shou'd be any ways uneasy about it only I apprehend she is inform'd of what we had agreed shou'd be kept secret If you will give me Leave continu'd he to declare my Passion to your Father we shall soon know what to depend on  I must confess Madam the only Motive I had to make a Mystery of it was the Pleasure of being secretly belov'd by a Man whom I esteem'd so worthy my Affection therefore I desired he would stay some Time longer before he discovered his Sentiments  Consider Don  Ramire  said I that our Condition is not so unhappy as you imagine We live together in the same House and in Spite of the jealous Eyes which continually observe us we see one another every Day and our Love is mutual  Such as these were our daily Conversations when we perceiv'd by Don  Sanche  's assiduous Courtship to my Sister that his Passion for her had receiv'd a new Addition We thought she treated him with so much Distinction as perswaded us he wou'd soon be happy in her Favour which extremely overjoy'd us for we waited nothing else to perfect our Felicity How bless'd will be my Days said Don  Ramire  to me when without Opposition I shall possess those Excellencies I now adore Ah dear  Inea  does your Heart sympathize with mine and may I hope to find in you those Endearments which none but tender Lovers can truly relish If once I am so fortunate as to obtain that Wish continued he no Thought of any other Happiness for sure there can be none shall ever dwell in this Bosom My Vows shall be dedicated to you alone and the Height of my Ambition will only be to merit your Love  Alas Madam you may imagine these obliging Assurances from a Man I so entirely loved made the Days pass like Hours but will you believe that while we were expecting the Conclusion of my Sister's Marriage with Don  Sanche  her Jealousy increas'd to such a Degree that it wou'd not give her a Moment's Peace She was more taken up with the Thoughts of Revenge than with the Care of pleasing a Person who was proposing to her so advantageous an Alliance I heard that one Day Don  Sanche  having desired  Leave to speak to his Father about it she suddenly chang'd Colour and her Eyes express'd a more than ordinary Grief I can no longer be silent said she to him in a Cause wherein you are interested since you confess a Passion for me and seem willing to unite your Destiny with mine let me tell you Sir you must first destroy the Hopes of a Rival to whom I am already engag'd Don  Ramire  has obtained the Consent of my Family and impatiently expects an Answer from his to terminate every Thing Before I saw you I was not aversed to him but alas I cannot now think of my Fate without Horror I do not doubt but your Love and Courage united will release me from this Engagement since nothing except my Inclination for you cou'd induce me to decline it Here her malicious Tears interrupted her Discourse and by this Stratagem Don  Sanche  was easily perswaded to undertake any desperate Thing against Don  Ramire  He assured her he wou'd soon make him renounce his Pretensions to her if he had Assurance enough to oppose him in a Place where his Authority was great and in an Affair where his Heart was so particularly concern'd adding to these Words all that Love cou'd inspire  This made  Mathilda  believe Don  Ramire  wou'd rather yield her up than engage in her Quarrel or that if he answer'd the Challenge out of a Point of Honour he wou'd have a potent Enemy to contend with She must  have been very revengeful to enter into a Sentiment so opposite to those of her Sex for she imprudently expos'd at once two Persons who were very dear to her Don  Sanche  impatient to come to a Decision with Don  Ramire  writ to him that Night in Terms which show'd an insupportable Pride He thus address'd him  THE Passion I have for  Mathilda  will not admit of a Rival I am inform'd you are mine tho' it little concerns me You know who I am and that you will be disappointed in contending with me therefore I advise you to be secret in this Affair and generously yield a Pretension you cannot dispute without Rashness  Don  Ramire  was highly provok'd at readind this haughty Billet and tho' he knew it was a Plot of my Sister's yet he wou'd not let me into his Resolutions fearing I might oppose 'em but immediately return'd Don  Sanche  an Answer in these Terms  THE Indifference I have for  Mathilda  cou'd not have engag'd me to dispute her Heart with any one but your self It's sufficient you admire her for me to oppose your Pretensions and in Return to your Liberty with me I advise you never to see her more unless you intend with your Life to satisfy my Resentment  As Don  Ramire  believ'd so violent a Beginning wou'd have a suitable Consequence he went the next Day to a Place where he thought he might meet him as he effectually did Don  Sanche  no sooner perceiv'd him but came up and said in a low Voice without the least Affectation Well Sir are you dispos'd to measure your Sword with mine I am dispos'd to punish your Insolence reply'd Don  Ramire  and shall expect you on the Strand by the SeaSide where no Body may prevent us They separated on this and Don  Ramire  went to the appointed Place  He was hardly there when he saw Don  Sanche  coming up to him with menacing Looks They both immediately drew and made several Passes at each other Don  Ramire  parry'd those of his Enemy and soon put him in some Disorder till at last he gave him a mortal Wound which hardly left him Life enough to confess the Author of his Fate As for Don  Ramire  he returned Home with so much Serenity in his Countenance that it was to be admir'd He did not even think of taking the least Care of his Safety and seem'd as if some secret Charm detain'd him Alas I am perswaded that fatal Charm was my self He spoke to me with a Freedom I cou'd not attribute to any thing but the Greatness of his Soul and I had no Room to suspect the Misfortune which had just happened to him when of a sudden the Governour and his  Guards surrounded my Father's House and snatch'd him from my Arms in Spite of all I cou'd do to oppose 'em  Those Moments I cannot call to mind without the greatest Concern The Governour who was perfectly distracted as well as inconsolable for the Loss of his only Son came himself on purpose to sacrifice Don  Ramire  to his Resentment I do not at all doubt but as he was seconded by a strong Guard he wou'd have kill'd my Lover before my Face had not I prevented him by standing between 'em and to save him expos'd my self to all the Danger for tho' I am naturally so timerous that even the Sight of a drawn Sword strikes me with Terror yet I assure you Madam on that Occasion I behav'd my self with so much Resolution that I am convinc'd to be Brave it is sufficient to be in Love  Don  Ramire  who saw with the utmost Despair the Danger which threatened me was like a Lyon defending himself against a Company of eager Huntsmen he wounded some and avoided the Fury of others but alas his Courage and the little Assistance I cou'd afford him did not hinder them from seizing and carrying him immediately to Prison  I thought at that Time my Soul wou'd have departed from its Habitation my Blood turn'd so cold in my Veins I would have follow'd Don  Ramire  and shar'd his Misfortunes had not my Mother and Sister prevented me  Mathilda  more like a Fury than a reasonable  Creature loaded me with Imprecations and Reproaches The Death of Don  Ramire  said she shall revenge me as well as the Person whose Fate I deplore The Traitor shall be a Sacrifice to the Governour's just Resentment and my Heart can receive no real Pleasure till the Day comes that he is to lose his Life The Violence of my Grief wou'd not permit me to make any Answer my Eyes said enough and I have well experienc'd that excessive Affliction makes every Thing but its Cause indifferent to us  Who can represent the Torture I lay in all that Night As soon as it was Day I sent to some of Don  Ramire  's Friends desiring they wou'd acquaint me with what they knew concerning his Fate I was then inform'd he had been examined and the partial Judgment of the Court had already condemn'd him the Governour being resolv'd not to show him the least Favour but as there was a Form to be observed in the Tryal they had permitted an Acquaintance of his whose Name was Don  Tiello  to plead in Defence of his Life  Far from sinking under this Misfortune I receiv'd new Strength from its Extremity It is no Time now to shed Tears cry'd I the Safety of my Lover is what I must think on  Teresa  continued I you were ever faithful to me and are the only Person in whom I can confide go run and buy me a Suit of Mens Cloaths for I am resolv'd to see Don  Ramire  I can pretend I am Son to Don  Tiello  who  sends me to inform him of what is passing in his Affair and by that Means I shall be admitted to enter the Prison where we may take Measures together for his Escape Ah Madam take Care what you do reply'd she if you are known what will become of you I am not in a Condition said I that will permit me to apprehend any thing We must endeavour to snatch Don  Ramire  from the Governour's Revenge and when he is safe I shall have Time enough to think on what relates to me In ending these Words I obliged her to get me the Cloaths which I immediately put on and fancy'd in that Dress I might very well pass for a young Cavalier  Night being come I ordered  Teresa  to take the Key of my Chamber and give out I was ill in Bed then went out in this Disguise protected by none but my Guardian Angels If by Misfortune said I Don  Tiello  who has generously offer'd to defend Don  Ramire  shou'd be with him or perhaps come in whilst I am there what must I do and how shall I extricate my self from such a Difficulty Love said I oh Love for whom I suffer unconceivable Torments be favourable to me this time you see my deep Concern for the Danger which threatens my Lover I have little Hopes and every Thing to fear unless his Safety becomes your Care  When I was arriv'd at this fatal Prison I hardly had Strength to support me my Spirits were feeble and I found my self in much  Disorder The first Person I spoke to was the Jaylor's Daughter I told her I was Don  Tiello  's Son Friend to Don  Ramire  and was come to inform him of the State of his Affairs At these Words she press'd my Hand like a Person in some Concern and said Ah Sir the unhappy Gentleman is lost if you do not take speedy Measures to save him I know more of that Matter than you continued she and perhaps interest my self as much The Place we were in was so dark that I cou'd not see her Face tho' I had a great Curiosity to know the Person who express'd her self so feelingly but I said in a trembling Voice pray tell me what you have heard concerning him All the Judges reply'd she are devoted to the Governour and Don  Ramire  will be condemn'd without Appeal I have endeavoured in vain to find an Opportunity of speaking to to him but never cou'd see him since he was brought here cover'd with Blood and Dust and in that dismal Condition he appear'd to me the handsomest Man I had ever seen Alas how fatal was that Sight to me I was so touch'd with his Misfortune that all my Thoughts ever since have been employ'd on his Safety and I am happy enough to have found an Expedient which cannot fail  Here she was silent but after a little Pause assum'd her Discourse and since you are his Friend continued she I ought not to conceal from you the Disposition I have for him I  must confess I love him and my Affection is rais'd to such a Degree that I am resolv'd to deliver him from hence if in giving him his Life he will dedicate the Remainder of it to me and render my Fate inseparable from his Tell him how near the Danger is since he will not have common Mercy shown him and that if he can purchase his Life on these Terms I am ready to serve him I know he is a Man of Quality and the vast Disproportion there is between us but the Condition I hope will make me acceptable to him I shall for his sake expose my Family to the Governour's Resentment who will believe my Father contriv'd his Escape and perhaps punish him accordingly How often have I said to my self  Laurea  unfortunate  Laurea  cease attempting a Happiness that meets with such Difficulties What has my Passion for a Stranger Power enough to make me forsake my Parents Alas Sir I have disputed with my self till I am no longer Mistress of my Reason I cou'd sacrifice every thing for him he is dearer to me than Life and the Danger he is in affects me beyond Imagination Assure him from me that my Heart never receiv'd an Impression before I am young and tho' not beautiful may pass for agreeable Oh how happy shou'd I think my self if he did but like me And cou'd his Passion proceed more from Inclination than Gratitude I shou'd die transported Yet said she to me as you are particularly acquainted with him pray tell me whether he is not already  engaged for in fine as I do every thing for him I also expect he will make me an equal Return therefore go to him I shall wait your Answer here in order to undertake something in his Favour  Tho' my Heart was so contracted with Grief that I cou'd hardly answer her after she had ceas'd speaking I said to her Madam your Design in preserving a Gentleman so deserving of Life is truly generous I am perswaded he will not be ungrateful and shall let you know his Sentiments when I return She left me immediately to tell her Father I was Don  Tiello  's Son who desired to see Don  Ramire  He made no Difficulty but conducted me to the Place where this unhappy Gentleman was shut up Alas Madam where shall I find Words to express the Anguish and Trouble I felt at that Instant What am I going to do and what Advice shall I give him said I Must I deliver him up to my Rival No I cannot bear the Thought of it He shall never know the Passion she has for him then reproaching my self for coming to such a Resolution What continued I wou'd I thus see him perish and deliver him up to the Fury of his Enemies Oh sure I cannot be guilty of so much Cruelty for rather than let him die he shall be hers I will with my own Hand give him to her and since I am destin'd to be a Sacrifice my Peace and Liberty shall be the Ransom of his Preservation  Thus Madam I came to the Chamber where Don  Ramire  was confin'd and being let in the Doors were shut again He was so extremely thoughtful that he hardly turn'd his Eyes towards me till I spoke to him What makes you so dispirited Sir said I Where is that Courage which ever supported you The Tone of my Voice made me known to him and opening his Arms Oh my Angel cry'd he the only dear Object of my Vows Is it you I see here in this frightful Prison Are you come to share my Pains At these Words he took hold of my Hand and kiss'd it with Transports of the greatest Passion I sat down by him and was some Time before I cou'd recover my Speech so many dismal Thoughts conspir'd to increase my Despair at last I made an Effort and said if you knew my dear Don  Ramire  what is contriving against you my Presence wou'd not give you all this Joy They are working your Ruin and you cannot possibly avoid the Misfortune you are threatened with but by Marrying  Laurea  the Jaylor's Daughter who is in Love with you and will do her utmost to save you The Dress I am in deceiv'd her and she has confess'd her Passion for you she charg'd me to inform you of it and requires your Answer assuring me at the same Time you will have nothing to fear if once you consent to her Wishes I conjure you then by all our Affection to embrace this important Occasion Marry her since there is no other Remedy  left I had rather deplore the Loss of your Heart than that of your Life O fatal Resolution added I must I even lose the Hopes of ever being yours But alas what do I say It is no time now to reflect I cannot ballance your Interest with mine You must live Sir tho' you live for another Whilst unhappy  Inea  retired to some remote solitary Place will be dead to you and to the rest of the world  Don  Ramire  heard me with Surprize and made me this Reply Do you think Madam I shall not always prefer Death to an inglorious Life and that I am capable of making you the Sacrifice No unfortunate as I am Love and Resolution are my Companions and nothing shall ever make me change Here I cou'd not restrain my Tears which he perceived and said cease weeping my dear  Inea  Why will you add to my Calamities Oh rather conceal your Trouble since it is in vain to advise me to such an Alliance Must I speak to you no more of it reply'd I sighing Are you then resolv'd on your Death and mine and will your Love and Courage be of no other Help to you than to let you fall a Victim to an incens'd Parent whose only Son you have destroyed At least strive to save your self promise every thing to  Laurea  and perform what you please You know me very little Madam interrupted he if you believe I can be so perfidious This young Creature will depend on my Assurances and I cannot resolve to deceive her Heavens What  shall we do then cry'd I Your tender Scruples are very ill timed Do you consider how near you are the Danger which threatens you and that your Fate is almost inevitable I beg of you I conjure you to comply with  Laurea  tho' you are dearer to me than Life Alas if I saw the least Ray of Hope do you think I wou'd desire you to act so contrary to my Peace Oh my Dear my eternal Love continu'd I don't sacrifice your self to our mutual Affection but yield to my last and earnest Request  A Deluge of Tears follow'd these Words and my Spirits were so faint that I cou'd hardly continue my Discourse Ah how fatal will your Pity be to me cry'd he Your Trouble pierces my Heart Don't be so dejected charming  Inea  Heaven will take care of us Yes said I Heaven wou'd take care of us indeed if you did but second its Inspirations Has not Providence sent you  Laurea  Oh name her not reply'd he I conjure you by all the Powers of Love never to mention her more You are resolv'd to perish then said I I wou'd live for you answer'd he but if it be not possible I will at least die constant and be satisfy'd with giving you the last Proof of my Fidelity Here in a deep Silence he embrac'd my Knees and moisten'd my Hands with his Tears which gave a new Course to mine My Breast was fill'd with Grief and in this sad Moment a Thought came into my Head which I fancy'd might be executed without much Difficulty  Don't be against all the Ways there are left to preserve your Life said I but swear by your Passion for me that you will strictly follow the Advice I am going to give you It's unnecessary you shou'd engage me by Oath to obey you reply'd he you know I am devoted to your Commands and tho' I cou'd not consent to deceive  Laurea  you must not judge from thence of what I am capable of doing for you Well said I you shall have nothing to say to her I will be with you about this time to Morrow and we must exchange Cloaths you shall go out in mine and immediately repair to Don  Tiello  who will have Notice of it There are Vessels going out a Cruising and as you have Relations at the Court of  Morocco  you may find an Opportunity of going to a Place where you will be out of the Power of your Enemies What Madam cry'd he and leave you here a Prisoner in my room expos'd to the Fury of your Relations and the Governour's Resentment Must you be sacrifie'd for my Liberty No I had rather die before your Face I am not base enough to resolve on any such thing I see very well said I to him in an angry Tone that I must use all my Authority to make you obey me Since you compel me to it Sir I command you to prepare your self to go off in the manner I told you I protest if you continue to be obstinate I never will see you more I retract the Promise I made you of being yours and dispense you  of all your Vows to me so that now being free we may dispose as we please of our Destinies  Never was Man in a greater Confusion than poor Don  Ramire  when he heard me utter these Words he flung himself at my Feet and look'd like one distracted Are you then resolv'd Madam to hate me and make another Man happy said he what Crime have I committed to deserve so many Misfortunes I only refuse to fly this Prison because I wou'd not leave you here sure this Proof of my Passion cannot be so cruel an Offence Why will you add one Torment to another I must be absolutely obey'd reply'd I since in leaving me here I run no Risque  Laurea  will get me out and it's with her I shall take Measures for that Purpose therefore if you love me do not oppose my setting you free Alas Madam dispose of me as you please said he in a dejected Manner I am wholly yours and never wou'd have disputed your Power were it not for the fear I was in of exposing you to inevitable Dangers I am now satisfy'd answer'd I for be assur'd Don  Ramire  if I lov'd you less I shou'd not have been so displeas'd with your Refusal At these Words he passionately kiss'd my Hand and with tender Regret we separated  The Jaylor being told by a Soldier of the Guard that I wanted to have the Door open'd came and conducted me out but I was uneasy not seeing  Laurea  who having veil'd her self  was standing in a dark Passage near the outward Gate where on a sudden I heard her say Hold Sir pray let me know what News from the Person you have just seen he acknowledges your Generosity with the highest Gratitude Madam said I and will make you Mistress of his Fate being resolv'd to live only for you I fear you flatter me reply'd she for I am easily deceiv'd but if you do Heaven will punish you both No said I do not suspect his Honour nor mine you shall never have reason to repent your generous Sentiments but when will you set him free As soon as possible answer'd she my Father and the Soldiers who guard him eat together I intend to put Opium in their Wine and when they are asleep steal the Keys so let him out But what will become of us afterwards continu'd  Laurea  You shall embark together said I and rejoyce at your good Fortune far from  PortoReal  thus I left her and she seem'd highly pleas'd at the Assurances I gave her  I was going towards home when I thought it very necessary Don  Tiello  shou'd be inform'd of what had pass'd therefore I went to him and told him I had us'd his Name to be admitted into the Prison which I hop'd he wou'd approve that I had been trying Means for my Friend's Escape and as I did not doubt of succeeding we had agreed he shou'd come to him as soon as he was free being persuaded he wou'd be so generous as to take care of his Safety till he had found a Ship to carry  him to  Morocco  The Circumstance is very lucky said he for my Brother lies now in the Road and only waits a fair Wind to sail for that Coast be assur'd I shall neglect no Opportunity of serving him After this Answer I desir'd him not to go the next Day to the Prison because I was to be there and shou'd pass for his Son so left him without being known and my Mind was more compos'd than it had been ever since Don  Ramire  's fatal Confinement  By this time I was come home where I found  Teresa  waiting for me I related to her all that had pass'd but when I recollected I had advis'd Don  Ramire  to lay his Liberty at  Laurea  's Feet I thought I cou'd never have been capable of acting so contrary to my Sentiments What cou'd I do  Teresa  said I for were he as weak as I have been and had Fear made him inconstant by this time I shou'd see him no longer mine and on the other side had I not us'd this Stratagem in a few Days he wou'd be no more in the World  I found some Ease in entertaining her after this manner most part of the Night and representing to her his extraordinary Passion and Constancy his Design of going to  Morocco  and mine of meeting him there I ought not to distrust said I the Promise he has given me since he declar'd he rather wou'd chuse Death than be contracted to his Deliverer and if I can get my Jewels which are in my Mother's keeping nothing shall prevent my making this  Voyage  Teresa  told me it was easy enough to get into her Closet and if I wou'd carry her with me she wou'd take upon her to get 'em tho' she shou'd hazard her Life for it Her Affection to my Service so sensibly touch'd me that I embrac'd her and promis'd never to forsake her You must go out with me to Morrow Night continu'd I disguis'd in Men's Cloaths for fear my Relations perceiving my Flight and the Loss of the Jewels shou'd seize you as Don  Tiello  is a Man of Honour and in our Prisoner's Interest I will meet him before I go to the Prison and tell him my Resolution of staying in Don  Ramire  's Place I shall desire him at the same to protect you and procure us a Ship to follow him But Madam reply'd she what will you do with  Laurea  whom you intend to deceive under the Notion of your being Don  Ramire  She will follow your Fortune and if she discovers who you are may give you a great deal of Trouble This requiring some Reflection every thing I had to fear presented it self to my Imagination all that Night and tormented me a thousand different Ways  The next Morning I pretended I was extremely indispos'd to prevent my Mother's suspecting I had any Design and as soon as it was Dusk of Evening  Teresa  disguis'd enter'd my Mother's Closet and took the Jewels as we had propos'd it then I went directly to the Prison where  Laurea  was expecting me without any Light I told her I was resolv'd  to expose my Life for her and Don  Ramire  's Service assuring her I wou'd carry them to a Ship which wou'd soon put 'em out of the Power of their Enemies My Fate is in your Hands reply'd she and provided I am with him I love carry me where you please I am now endeavouring his Liberty and do not doubt but I shall succeed in what I undertake I return'd her Thanks in the Name of Don  Ramire  then hiding my self with my Cloke went to the Jaylor whom I complimented in few Words and desired the Favour of seeing Don  Ramire  as from my Father you shall see him this Night and no more said he to me in a rough manner for Orders are given that none but Don  Tiello  shou'd be admitted and if the Governour knew I suffer you to speak to him he wou'd make me repent it This unexpected Reception stun'd me Alas thought I if we do not improve this Opportunity we are all undone  Don  Ramire  as soon as I enter'd his Chamber receiv'd me in his Arms and saluted me with so much Tenderness in his Words and Actions that it show'd at once his Love and Gratitude Come my Dear said I let us make good use of this precious Moment put on my Cloaths immediately and give me yours cover your Face after the same manner I did mine and if you meet  Laurea  as you go out tell her Don  Ramire  depends entirely on her Friendship  Teresa  in whom I conside is dress'd in Mens Cloaths and waits  at the end of a Street to go along with you to Don  Tiello  's who is ready to receive you as for my part I shall stay here till  Laurea  comes to relieve me Alas my charming  Inea  reply'd he how shall I resolve to forsake you No my only Dear I cannot submit to a Command so desperate If I must perish or lose you I readily prefer the first Ah cruel Man said I shall we then dispute for ever and will you act both your own Destruction and mine How can you be so obstinate I beg you dear Don  Ramire  I conjure you by all the Love you ever profess'd to me and the Proofs I have given you of a Return not to deny me this Favour I fear every thing on your Account but have little to fear on my own obey me this Instant and make no Reply  Thus Madam I at last persuaded him tho' not without much Difficulty and having divested my self of my Clothes I made him put 'em on The Disguise seem'd favourable to him and I was flattering my self with a successful Event when the Hour of parting drew near Our Sighs and Tears were the Interpreters of our excessive Grief Is it possible I have Resolution enough said Don  Ramire  to act a Part so contrary to the Sentiments of my Soul Oh think that in obeying you this Day I give you the greatest Testimony of an inviolable Passion I regard it as a Proof of your Constancy reply'd I which will have its Reward our Fortune may receive a happy Change then we shall triumph over our ill  Stars I even feel a secret Satisfaction in my present Misfortune since it gives me an Opportunity of showing how much I love you In what a different State is my bleeding Heart cry'd he Can I ever be more unhappy than to leave you in this frightful Place and live some Days without you But continued he be assur'd my Body only will be separated from you my Thoughts shall ever attend you receive my Vows divine  Inea  and let this Ring be the Pledge of my Love Heaven ordain we may be so united as never to be parted more I accept your Hand reply'd I here receive mine and may the superior Powers be witness of our Promises Adieu my Dear continued I embracing him and bathing his Face with my Tears Farewel my Angel said he pressing me in his Arms it grieves my very Soul to leave you  Don  Ramire  in this manner was conducted out and as soon as I had lost sight of him all my Fears for him and my own Conduct came hurrying to my Mind I know not Madam how it was possible I cou'd bear with the Anxiety of my Thoughts all that was dismal and full of Terror enter'd my Imagination whilst I was uncertain of his Fate but by the time I thought he might be out of Danger my afflicted Mind receiv'd some Relief  As I had pass'd but a very indifferent Night I lay all the next Day on the Bed which made the Jaylor believe I was sick therefore whenever he came into my Chamber he wou'd not  interrupt me but leaving what was necessary by me retired I continued in this Situation till the Evening when I was agreeably surpriz'd with a Visit from Don  Tiello  who brought me a Letter and inform'd me of Don  Ramire  's being happily embark'd he highly commended the Resolution I had shown in staying in his Place with the hazard of my Life to preserve his but after he had been some time with me he discover'd I was not what I appear'd to be the Tone of my Voice my Complexion and particularly the Emotion I was in when I spoke of Don  Ramire  with the Joy I express'd at receiving his Letter and my Tears every thing confirm'd his Suspicions yet for fear of offending me he wou'd not mention any thing of the Matter protesting only he wou'd do all that depended on him to serve me and that I cou'd not confide in a Person who wou'd make a more generous return After some Discourses of this Nature he took Leave of me wishing I might meet a Recompence proportionable to so great and perfect a Friendship I pass'd the rest of my Night in reading over and over Don  Ramire  's Letter which was the only Consolation I had the five Days I was Prisoner it was writ in these Terms  I Have left you my dear  Inea  in so frightful a Place and with such melancholy Circumstances that you may easily imagine the Condition I am in is not less deplorable than yours I must confess  I was just on the Point of returning to you but the Apprehension I was under of displeasing you prevented my giving such a Proof of my Love Oh ought I not to be asham'd you shou'd have surpass'd me in Generosity and that I cou'd be weak enough to suffer it Yet do not interpret this to the Prejudice of One who only consented to fly that he might preserve himself yours and since our good Fortune equally depends on my Life I shall take care of it as an Offering no longer mine but consecrated to you Come then speedily my Angel and let us by our Union taste immortal Pleasures My leaving this Place is defer'd no longer than the finishing this Letter I am going and shall expect you with Impatience proportionable to the Happiness of our next meeting Adieu my Soul Adieu my only Dear we shall have no Reason I hope to complain hereafter of Fortune since our Passion surpasses every thing that has ever been known in the World  I must tell you Madam I had taken  Teresa  with me to the Prison by which means I made her acquainted with  Laurea  who suppos'd her to be a young Gentleman and our intimate Friend As they us'd often to meet in a Place they had appointed for that Purpose  Laurea  cou'd not help saying one Day to her that she was very uneasy concerning what she shou'd act in favour of Don  Ramire  and that she had a mind to leave him in Confinement for what can I hope from him continu'd she I may depend on a great deal of Chagrin on account  of my Father who will be prosecuted for his Escape I shall be the occasion of the Ruin of my Family and how do I know but I may be lost with them It's true I am promis'd every thing from Don  Ramire  yet my Birth is so inferior to his that nothing less than an extraordinary Passion cou'd induce him to condescend to our Alliance besides he has never seen me and when we are once embark'd together instead of loving me perhaps he may hate me Oh I think my self already abandon'd by him and set ashore on some desert Island where Death will be the Recompence of all my Pains  Teresa  trembled at what she heard this young Creature say knowing I cou'd only make my Escape by her means so omitted nothing to bring her back to her first Intentions Generous  Laurea  said she I am persuaded if you knew the Person you propose to serve as well as I do you wou'd never change your Resolution he has all the Sentiments of a Man of Honour and I am sure his Passion for you will be eternal The Chimeras you frame to your self have not the least Foundation I therefore conjure you to be constant in so important a Cause which will undoubtedly contribute to your good Fortune as well as his  Laurea  asham'd of having shown so much Inequality of Temper made some Excuses then resolv'd again on her first Design I am willing to believe you said she and to convince you of the Truth be here exactly at Two after Midnight  I will bring Don  Ramire  to you every thing is ready for his Escape and you may take Measures for our Departure  Teresa  extreamly overjoy'd at these Words left her immediately and went to Don  Tiello  to tell him Don  Ramire  's Friend whom he had seen in Prison wou'd be that Night set free and desired he wou'd prepare a Sloop for their going off but continu'd she how shall we disengage our selves from  Laurea  who will do us all the Prejudice in her Power if once she perceives we have betray'd her When she comes aboard said he and finds it is not Don  Ramire  's Concern she will be too happy to return home without discovering any thing for fear they shou'd charge her with having an Hand in his Escape and if some unforeseen Accident does not happen I am persuaded we shall manage this Affair to our Satisfaction  As I cou'd not tell what Hour  Laurea  had appointed to set me at Liberty I began to be very much tired with my Confinement but in the dead of Night I was reliev'd of my Uneasiness when I heard my Door open softly and saw the Jaylor's Daughter being wrap'd in my Cloak I advanc'd towards her with my Face almost hid for fear she shou'd discover I was not Don  Ramire  I embrac'd her with the greatest Marks of a violent Passion but said little to her on the Score of my Gratitude she was in such Disorder her self that I believe it wou'd have been hard for her to perceive the Deceit had she even seen my  Face In one Hand she had a dark Lanthorn and in the other a Bunch of Keys so without saying any thing to me she made me a Sign to follow her which I did and we pass'd all the Soldiers who were fast asleep as she had contriv'd it by putting Opium in their Wine Thus we left the Place without the least Obstacle but as soon as we were in the Street she took hold of my Arm as if she were afraid I shou'd fly her cling'd to me so close that I was hardly able to walk  Don  Tiello  and  Teresa  were waiting for me in the Place they had appointed from whence we went together to the Seaside where we found the Boat belonging to the Ship which was to carry me to  Morocco  The Night was very dark and  Laurea  made me a thousand Caresses I cou'd but very ill return being in pain to know what wou'd become of this young Creature after she had discover'd the Plot We were not long a making up to the Vessel and as soon as we came on board Don  Tiello  carry'd us into the Captain's Cabbin but Madam how shall I tell you the Surprize I was in when I found this Captain to be my Father who was no less astonish'd to see  Teresa  and me after all the Enquiry that had been made about us throughout the whole City Don  Tiello  knowing he profess'd a great Friendship for Don  Ramire  had trusted him with the Secret and declar'd I was that unhappy Gentleman's Mistress who had resolv'd to follow his Fortune into  Morocco  in Man's Disguise he started back three or four Steps and not being Master of the first Effects of his Passion was going to draw his Sword when I flung my self at his Feet Oh Sir said I forgive me remember you are my Father and vouchsafe to hear before you punish me I embrac'd his Knees and wet his Hand with my Tears Tho' he entirely lov'd me yet in this Occasion he show'd his Resentment by making me many Reproaches and at last bid me say what I cou'd to justify my self  I knew my only Remedy was to confess the Truth which I did in so feeling a Manner that it mov'd his Compassion He was very well acquainted with Don  Ramire  's Merit and had been thoroughly concern'd for his Imprisonment but being inform'd of his Escape he express'd an entire Satisfaction My Father left us to go into another Cabbin with Don  Tiello  who was very much his Friend I see said he you are surpriz'd as well as me at what has happened you were certainly a Stranger to  Inea  's Flight and did not think it was her you had put into my Hands I protest to you reply'd Don  Tiello  I am under a Consternation which I cannot express I can't say I have committed a Fault for perhaps it may turn to Advantage that the Affair has pass'd after this Manner but if you will make me perfectly easy I beg you will grant me your Daughter's Pardon whatever Reasons you have to be displeas'd with  her You see she is contracted to Don  Ramire  who is a Man of Birth and Fortune and in my Opinion you cannot dispose of her better than uniting her Destiny to his I agree with you reply'd my Father but his Proceedings to obtain  Inea  without my Consent highly offend me I receiv'd him into my House as a particular Friend and wou'd have willingly given my eldest Daughter to him was it nor a very ill Return he made to so much Civility when he engag'd this young Creature to disguise her self and follow him like a Madwoman If you remember what  Inea  has related to us reply'd Don  Tiello  she is alone culpable yet of all Crimes those which Love makes us commit are most excuseable and especially in a young Person who has so little Experience Forgive her then I conjure you added he and you will confer an Obligation on me which I shall ever acknowledge My Father who was already dispos'd to favour me embracing Don  Tiello  said to him I am considerably indebted to you for entering so generously into the Interest of my Family and will forget  Inea  's Crime since you desire it if Don  Ramire  has a real Passion for her I shall rejoice at the Match and as a Proof of my Satisfaction I will carry her to  Morrocco  in order to compleat their Happiness  This Conversation ended in my Favour as you see Madam which I little expected for I was in the Cabbin so extremely afflicted  that I may say no Sorrow cou'd be equal to mine What will become of me said I to  Teresa  I am for ever unfortunate I loose my Liberty in the very Moment I thought my self Mistress of my Destiny and I am now in the Power of a Father who will have no Mercy of me Alas poor Don  Ramire  I must never see him more he will certainly think I am Dead or Inconstant and either of the Two will drive him into Despair I shall be deliver'd up to my Mother and Sister's Severities which is a Misfortune I can never endure  Whilst I was speaking  Laurea  look'd at me with the Eyes of a Fury Don't you deserve the Fate you have met with said she Nay even more than what seems to threaten you You have deceived me perfidious as you are and improv'd my Weakness in Favour of your Lover I have just delivered up my Family to the Governour's Resentment but don't think to escape me you shall be my Victim as I am your's In pronouncing these Words she flung her self upon me and I do not doubt but wou'd have stifled me had not  Teresa  come to my Assistance as well as my Father and Don  Tiello  who hearing a Noise ran and freed me from this mad Creature's Rage I stood in want of their Help for I did not resist her prefering Death to an unhappy Life  Don  Tiello  saw very well to what a Condition my Grief had reduc'd me and neglected nothing to ease my troubled Mind he beg'd  I wou'd no longer afflict my self I have prevail'd with your Father Madam said he and he has promis'd me to carry you to  Morocco  I had not patience to hear any more but upon these Assurances went and flung my self at my Father's Feet and embracing his Knees express'd my Gratitude he told me with a great deal of Goodness that as it was Don  Tiello  's Request he forgave me and consented I shou'd marry Don  Ramire  At these Words  Laurea  cry'd aloud and made such Complaints as wou'd move any one with Pity I knew by my self what she suffered Alas said I to  Teresa  were my Case like hers how wretched shou'd I be She loves Don  Ramire  and was flatter'd with the Hopes of passing the rest of her Days with him but now those agreeable Thoughts are all destroy'd She loves him less than you imagine reply'd  Teresa  and if I had not done my utmost to make her pursue her first Intentions I very much doubt the Performance of what she promis'd you Here  Teresa  related to us what had pass'd between them as I have already inform'd you Madam and Don  Tiello  told  Laurea  the best Thing she cou'd do was to return to  PortoReal  before Day that her Father might not know of her having a Hand in the Matter so he took his Leave of us and carrying her with him into the Boat they both went ashore  I had but just Time to change my Cloaths when you came on Board and your Trouble  Madam interrupted the Pleasure I began to taste at the Thoughts of seeing Don  Ramire  who as yet has not heard of my Misfortune he will leave  Morocco  perhaps in Hopes of finding me at  PortoReal  his Passion may make him forget the Danger which threatens him at that Place and I know not whether I shall ever see him more I have also lost  Teresa  who was so true to me this poor Creature was snatch'd from me by one of the Officers in the Admiral's Ship my Prayers cou'd not prevent her being carried off by this Barbarian and I assure you Madam had it not been for you I shou'd have sunk under the Load of innumerable Calamities  Here  Inea  endeavour'd to hide her Tears but cou'd not restrain their Course  Felicia  embrac'd her and us'd many tender Expressions to soften her Sorrow Alas my Dear said she I my self am very unfortunate and did you know the cruel Torments I endure you wou'd own you are not alone to be pitied but I consider it's Time for you to retire I have kept you up too long I am sensible Madam reply'd  Inea  I have tired your Patience with the Recital of my Adventures but that's a Fault which attends all unhappy Lovers since the only Consolation they have left 'em is that of lamenting their Fate You do me Injustice replied  Felicia  if you have so disobliging a Thought I am extremely pleased with your Compliance and to convince you thereof I will to Morrow in Return confide  the Secrets of my Life to you In finishing these Words she embrac'd her again and  Inea  went to her Bed  Phoebus  had no sooner grac'd the watery Plain but young  Inea  impatient to hear  Felicia  's Adventures rose and saluted her with a pleasant Morning I wish my Dear said  Felicia  to her I had not clos'd my Eyes all Night for I have had a frightful Dream concerning a Person I very much esteem he appeared to me in the greatest Dangers engag'd with the  Moors  and vanquish'd Oh how my Soul is alarm'd Your Mind is so possess'd with dismal Ideas reply'd  Inea  that you must not be surpriz'd if they affect you in your Sleep yet Madam Dreams are not to be taken Notice of Alas said  Felicia  they wou'd make no Impression on me at any other Time but what have I not to fear at present being far from my Country and from a Friend whose Absence is the chief Cause of my Uneasiness Tho' I own to you  Abelhamar  's Passion for me is no small Addition to my Woes since I must be continually on my Guard against the Pursuits of a Prince who has so much Power in this Court Unhappy Creature that I am Were not my Misfortunes great enough Why must the few Charms I have left serve only to render them the more insupportable Don't add to your Affliction Madam said  Inea  the Prince has too much Respect for you to use his Authority in Opposition to your Inclinations and you may  easily imagine as soon as your Relations are inform'd of your Destiny they will employ all their Interest to relieve you I shou'd be in the Wrong to doubt their Affection for me reply'd  Felicia  weeping tho' in their Opinion my Behaviour merits no Favour Oh that I rather owed my Liberty to the Man whose Presence now wou'd make me happy I find you are in Love Madam said  Inea  interrupting her I confess it reply'd  Felicia  blushing and since you have given me so great a Proof of your Confidence I promise you mine and will inform you of my Weakness  Felicia  began immediately to relate her Story from the time her Father had contracted her to the Prince of  Carency  but her Discourse was often interrupted with Tears which the Thoughts of her Misfortunes extorted from her I am not only concern'd said she at my being separated from the Count of  La Vagne  but inconsolable when I think how  Casilda  betray'd me after having chose her for my Friend and lov'd her sincerely I condemn her reply'd  Inea  and wonder how any one cou'd be so perfidious especially to a Person who no ways deserv'd such inhuman Usage  They were talking in this manner when the Governess of the Slaves came and bid 'em dress themselves in order to wait on the Queen to the  Mosquez  where they were oblig'd to attend tho' Christians  Felicia  during the Ceremony of those Infidels took such care to hide self in her Veil that altho'  Abelhamar  sought her with a great deal of Attention he cou'd not distinguish her from the rest of her Companions he did not doubt but this Affectation was design'd which so sensibly griev'd him that he retir'd to his Apartment and wrote the ensuing Letter  WHAT Crime have I committed lovely  Felicia  to deserve your Aversion You fly me and even deny me the Satisfaction of seeing your beauteous Face Can you be offended at a Passion your Charms have created What Violence have I not done my self to suppress my Transports rather than incur your Displeasure Oh treat me with less Severity my Love is worthy a more obliging Return since I am seeking Means to procure your Liberty which I hope to effect in spite of the Queen's Opposition  Celima  being return'd from the  Mosquez  order'd that some of the Slaves shou'd come and work by her  Felicia  was of the Number and as  Abelhamar  was watching an Opportunity to give her this Letter he approach'd her and slip'd it into her Lap which he thought she had perceiv'd and wou'd have taken care to hide it but it happen'd otherwise for the Queen who was inform'd of the Prince's Sentiments for  Felicia  seeing him put a Paper into her Work found Means to take it so was convinc'd of the Truth and extremely pleas'd this young  Spaniard  made no Return to  Abelhamar  's Passion The Queen  had a secret Aversion to him tho' his only Crime was that of being lawful Heir to the Crown she was in Possession of which was a sufficient Motive to make him disagreeable to her  That Evening  Celima  took a Walk in the Palace Gardens and as she had a Mind to speak with  Felicia  she call'd her as it were to lean on her Arm and advanc'd towards a TerraceWalk from whence one cou'd discover the SeaSide with a most delightful Prospect there she sate down and looking at  Felicia  with a graceful Air Tho' you have not been with me long said she I have a particular Kindness for you and am willing to tell you that if you have a Mind to merit my Affection you must entirely banish  Abelhamar  from your Heart I am inform'd of his Sentiments and know part of your's but it's to be fear'd that a young Creature as you are having no other Engagement and being flatter'd with the Hopes he gives you might sacrifice your Virtues to your Ambition yet I cannot believe you wou'd consent to be his Mistress for that is all you must expect from a Man who certainly never will Marry you I do not know Madam answer'd  Felicia  with a great deal of Modesty who cou'd speak to you of the Prince's Sentiments but if your Majesty is inform'd of mine you are convinc'd I have receiv'd his Offers in such a Manner as ought to destroy all the Hopes my Misfortunes might have given him the Condition I am in Madam continu'd she has not  made any dishonourable Impression on my Heart and I bless Heaven to find your Majesty so oppos'd to a Thing which I cou'd not think on without the greatest Horror for in my Opinion it is more glorious to die than live a Life destitute of Virtue  What said the Queen wou'd you sooner chuse Death than be Mistress to  Abelhamar  Who wou'd not as well as I Madam replied  Felicia  and what other Thought cou'd enter into one's Head This Resolution is my only Comfort since I know it to be an effectual Way to deliver me from an infamous Passion But if you have a Lover in  Spain  said the Queen do you consider that in dying at  Sallee  you never will see him more Suppose there were any One for whom I had an Inclination replied  Felicia  I shou'd be the more ready to die as being the strongest Evincement I cou'd give him of my Constancy for if it were my Misfortune not to live for him I never wou'd for any other Ha  Felicia  said the Queen smiling What do you tell me is it possible that  Cupid  hath already summon'd a Heart so young But alas there is no Age free from his Empire in one Moment the fatal Dart is lanc'd Ending these Words she sigh'd and remain'd some Time in a deep Silence  All the Ladies who attended the Queen were standing at such a Distance from the Place where she was sate that she cou'd speak to  Felicia  without being heard here said she taking  the Prince's Letter from her Bosom see what  Abelhamar  has wrote to you I believe you are virtuous therefore cannot suspect your Conduct When you see him take no Notice of my knowing his Sentiments but advise him not to persevere in his Design for instead of procuring your Liberty as he promises perhaps he may lose his own for the rest of his Days This she pronounc'd with a melancholy Accent then rose and return'd to the Palace  Felicia  overjoy'd at what the Queen had said to her join'd  Inea  whom she desired to stay with her in the Garden and they both went and sate down in the same Place which  Celima  had just quitted Notwithstanding all the Misfortunes that afflict me said  Felicia  to her Companion I have Cause to bless Heaven for the Disposition the Queen is in she forbids me receiving the Prince's Addresses think my Dear how willing I am to obey her and whether she had Need to use her Authority on this Occasion I congratulate you answer'd  Inea  since it adds to your Comfort but I cannot conceive out of what Motive she opposes a Thing which ought to be indifferent to her unless she has her self taken an Affection for him I am apt to believe said  Felicia  her Thoughts are employ'd on some Object and that her Heart is not entirely free from Love for when she ask'd me whether I had any Engagement I perceiv'd she grew of a sudden so pensive that it was some Time  before she cou'd recover her self yet I cannot think she likes the young Prince for as she is Mistress of her Destiny I suppose she might make him her Husband if it were her Pleasure I rather believe she intends to keep him under an absolute Submission to her Will Can she be so little acquainted with the Motions of a Heart interrupted  Inea  to imagine  Abelhamar  's Sentiments will receive Laws from a Sovereign whom he has some Reason to hate As for my part I know it wou'd be impossible for me either to Love or not Love by Command I might so far prevail with my self as to be silent or to counterfeit an Indifference and yet I cannot tell whether I shou'd act that Part so well as to please those who wou'd lay such a Duty on me I shall not dispute with you on that Subject replied  Felicia  but between us I esteem it a great Happiness that my Inclination is so ready to comply with the Queen's Commands  As she had finished her Discourse she perceiv'd a Man near her whom by the Light of the Moon she knew to be  Abelhamar  which not a little surpriz'd her she rose in order to run from him but he took hold of her and said Do not fly me thus cruel  Felicia  I am unfortunate enough to have heard your Conversation with  Celima  and cou'd wish my self dead rather than give you the Displeasure of seeing me once more at your Feet Here he was silent but after some Time  continu'd in this Manner What did I think One whom I look'd on a Divinity wou'd approve of the unjust Queen's Barbarity and reduce me to the last Despair by an inhumane Usage Take Care ungrateful  Felicia  how you behave your self towards me I am not here among Strangers and  Celima  who wou'd fain dispose of my Heart as she does of my Crown may find Fortune is not always constant and that Usurpers have ever Cause to fear My Lord replied  Felicia  I perceive you heard what the Queen said relating to you I must not concern my self in Affairs of State and since you know my Sentiments I shall make no Diffiulty in confessing them It is true I was sensibly pleas'd to receive a Command so positive and conformable to my Inclination for I cannot love an Enemy to my Country and Religion Why have I treated you like an Enemy answer'd the Prince What Advantage did I take of my Victory Was it a Crime to love and serve you I am sensible of all you acted for me interrupted  Felicia  and my Gratitude is equal to your Favours accept of it then my Lord as the only Return I can make and it's even more than the Queen will consent to  The Prince falling into a violent Passion lean'd himself against a Ballister of Marble Pillars which boarded the TerraceWalk and looking at  Felicia  with Despair in his Countenance I swear said he by our great  Mahomet  and by my Love that if I don't enjoy  you I will put the Kingdom of  Fez  into Desolation pull down from the Throne the unworthy Princess who sits on it and burn this magnificent Palace to Ashes You shall see  Felicia  what such a Lover as I can do when he finds himself despis'd Your Eyes shall cause more Confusion amongst us than any Revolution ever did Oh Heavens my Lord cry'd  Felicia  can any thing be more dreadful than such Designs What for an unfortunate Slave as I am wou'd you disturb the Peace of this Nation Are not my Woes great enough already must you attempt to force me away from the Queen after I have declar'd to you that I will resolve on Death sooner than consent to your Desires My Lord since I must confess it I am in Love with One in  Spain  and I will as willingly give my Life as marry any other Absence it self shall never lessen my Affection for him I know the Way to be constant and preserve my Heart for One whoNo I can hear you no longer said the Prince interrupting her you endeavour to distract me with the cruelest Things you can imagine but in Time I will be reveng'd on you the Queen and that dangerous Rival Finishing these Words he left  Felicia  Her Affliction was so great that she had hardly reach'd the Palace when she was seized with a violent Feaver which continu'd all that Night The Governess of the Slaves went next Morning to acquaint the Queen of  it who sent  Olympia Doria  to stay by her As soon as  Felicia  saw her enter the Chamber she said to her with a languishing Air The Condition I am in Madam will only give you Uneasiness and the Company of so unfortunate a Creature as I can be no ways agreeable to you I cannot tell whether it be a Pleasure to you to see me answer'd  Olympia  but I know very well nothing can give me a greater Satisfaction than being with you and tho' I am in Expectation of the only Happiness that can bless my Days yet in quitting this Palace I cannot help regretting the Absence of my charming  Felicia  How obliging you are my dearest Companion replied she but alas I shall have the greatest Cause to regret when I see you no more What Consolation wou'd it be me were I going with you to  Genoa  I have some Reasons to wish it I will not presume to ask 'em said  Olympia  fearing you shou'd think my Curiosity too great but if you will tell me why you are so desirous of going that Voyage I shall take it as a mighty Favour I will grant your Request replied  Felicia  as soon as my Health permits me and shall desire you also to acquaint me with some Particulars relating to a Person of that Country Which  Olympia  promis'd her and after having staid some Time with her she went and gave the Queen an Account of the Condition she was in  The mean while  Felicia  and  Inea  entertain'd each other with their Grief whenever they  found an Opportunity of being alone Shou'd I inform the Queen of  Abelhamar  's Menaces said  Felicia  to her Friend she wou'd take such Measures as might secure the Peace and Tranquility of her Kingdom and by sending me for  Spain  deliver me from his Violence but continu'd she after a Moment's Pause what Reproaches shou'd not I deserve supposing this young Prince was only urged by his Passion to speak as he did without having any Thoughts of executing so rash a Design and that upon my Information he shou'd be arrested then his Disgrace and perhaps the Loss of his Life wou'd be owing to me What an ungrateful Return shou'd I make to the obliging Sentiments he conceiv'd for me from the Beginning of my Misfortune  Inea  approv'd very much her prudent Considerations and represented to her how willingly the Queen wou'd embrace that Pretence to make a Sacrifice of  Abelhamar  whose Passion she only oppos'd with a Design to provoke him to use her with Disrespect which wou'd consequently bring him to inevitable Punishment and were it otherways it wou'd not stand with Reason that the Queen shou'd concern her self with any thing so much below her as a Slave  Felicia  was of  Inea  's Opinion and thought there was so much Probability in what she said that she chose rather to be silent in the Matter than make a Discovery which might be the Cause of greater Disorders so implor'd the Assistance of Heaven  for her Deliverance As for  Inea  she had already writ the Particulars of her Voyage to her Dear Don  Ramire  and was impatiently waiting his Answer  Abelhamar  whose Passion was grown desperate retired from the Queen's Palace to his own and there confin'd himself with his faithful  Mula  Cease flattering me said he and don't make me hope any thing from my Submission to the Queen and  Felicia  I now am too well inform'd of what I must expect from their Cruelty As I was walking in the Palace Garden distracted and melancholy I perceiv'd at a Distance  Celima  follow'd by her Women and to avoid paying my Court to her I retired to a Grotto under the TerraceWalk which I had just enter'd when the Queen leaning on  Felicia  's Arm came and seated her self in a Place where I cou'd distinctly hear all they said no  Mula  it is not possible to express the intolerable Aversion she has to me and with what Disdain she speaks of me she has given reiterated Commands to that lovely Captive to fly and hate me who ungrateful as she is not only receiv'd 'em with Pleasure but even promis'd  Celima  more than she requir'd of her and it was not long before I felt the Effect of it for as soon as the Queen was gone back to the Palace and I cou'd find an Opportunity to speak to this young Slave she confirm'd with a most rigorous Air what I had already heard and moreover told me she was in Love with  One in  Spain  and that nothing in the World shou'd ever make her change In a Word I find there is no Time to be lost I must immediately adhere to the King of  Tituan  's Proposals that Prince extremely resents  Celima  's Refusal a slighted Passion demands Revenge and he looks on me as One who is capable of assisting him Before I had seen  Felicia  I wou'd not favour his Designs thinking the Queen might chuse me to Reign with her Now I see my Error she not only hates me but even opposes my Happiness whereever I seek it  If I may be permitted to give you my Advice my Lord reply'd  Mula  I am of Opinion you shou'd speak to  Celima  before you enter into the King of  Tituan  's Interest and try whether you cannot bring her into a more favourable Disposition for you 'tis probable she may make some serious Reflection and for her own sake not provoke you to act any Thing desperate I am willing to make that one Step more said the Prince tho' ever so nice but as I believe the Queen has a Design to take me up let us be prepar'd for the Worst If I am put in Arrest do you go to  Tunis  tell  Ismael  the Number of Friends I have in this Court and manage Affairs so as by his Assistance and theirs I may obtain my Liberty possess my Love and be reveng'd  It was late before  Abelhamar  had ended his Conversation which prevented him from going the next Morning to the Queen's Apartment  and the first Thing he heard was  Felicia  's Illness This News caus'd him to be extremely uneasy he soon forgot all other Projects and fix'd his chiefest Thoughts on seeking Means to see the Person he lov'd which met with some Opposition  Celima  having given Orders he shou'd not be admitted into her Chamber and as for the Governess of the Slaves he cou'd not flatter himself with the Hopes of gaining her being an old Woman entirely devoted to the Queen's Will so that he was almost despairing of Success in his Enterprize but what is not Love capable of It conquers all Difficulties  The Prince being young and handsome resolv'd to disguise himself in Woman's Cloaths in order to be presented to the Queen by a Captain of a Ship with whom he was particularly acquainted He was a perfect Master of the  Spanish  Tongue and did not doubt but he might easily pass for One of that Nation He told his Design to  Mula  who used his Endeavours to divert him from an Attempt which might prove fatal to him but his Arguments were of little Weight where Love had so great an Influence He order'd immediately his Physician to be call'd and bid him give out every where he was dangerously ill of a Feaver and that it was convenient he should see no Company This News being talk'd of at Court the SeaCaptain brought him to the Palace among several other Slaves which he had lately taken The Queen took  a particular Notice of  Abelhamar  and ask'd him some Questions which might have puzled him had not his Wit been prevailing and his Replies so ingenious that they did not give her the least Suspicion of a Disguise The Governess of the Slaves having ask'd his Name he told her he was call'd  Eugenia  and that he was a Native of the Kingdom of  Castile  The Queen order'd she shou'd be conducted to  Felicia  who perhaps might know her and be much pleas'd to see One of her Country  Abelhamar  was sent in this manner to  Felicia  who was in Bed very much indispos'd He no sooner enter'd her Chamber but seeing her in this Condition he turn'd pale and seem'd so dejected that it wou'd have pitied any One that was present at this Interview As  Felicia  and  Inea  believ'd this new Slave's Affliction proceeded from her late Misfortune they were no ways surpriz'd at the Disorder she was in but endeavour'd by their kind Expressions to soften the Rigour of her unhappy State  The amorous Prince thus continu'd with his dear  Felicia  and the oftener he saw her the greater were the Effects of her Charms which at last so potently influenced him that he cou'd not resolve to quit the Palace esteeming himself too happy in the Company of his adorable Mistress He had so many Perfections that it wou'd have been easy for him to make the Conquest of the Queen's handsomest  Slaves had he made the least Pursuit towards it but his Heart was entirely fill'd with  Felicia  's Idea and all his Thoughts were employed on the only Care of pleasing her  She also very much contributed by her innocent Caresses to detain him Their Humours agreed so well that she desired as a Favour they wou'd let  Eugenia  stay with her during her Illness There is a secret Charm in your Conversation said she sometimes to her which gives me a much greater Pleasure than any I can find in that of my other Companions It is the Effect of my Love for you beauteous  Felicia  that inspires you with this Sympathy replied the passionate Prince and how bless'd shou'd I be were I as dear to you as you are to me but continu'd he if you will give me Leave to tell you my Thoughts I believe you are indifferent whether belov'd or not Alas how great wou'd be my Felicity answer'd  Felicia  with a melancholy Tone were I such as you represent me You little know my Sentiments they give me more Uneasiness than my unfortunate Captivity What Madam said the pretended  Eugenia  is it possible that after having wholly resign'd my self to you you wou'd make any thing a Secret to me If your Heart is touch'd with a tender Passion will it not be a Comfort to you to make me your Confident What shall I say to you replied  Felicia  I can only tell you my Weakness and confess an Engagement which is so dear to me that  it fills my Soul at once with a Thousand different Motions These Words cruelly affected the Prince who cou'd not utter one Syllable but turning pale he fix'd his Eyes on her and continu'd some Time in this Posture as astonish'd at what she said tho' she had already declar'd her Sentiments to him in the Garden At last he endeavour'd to speak and with a languishing Accent said I shou'd not be surpriz'd so perfect a Creature as you were ador'd yet  Felicia  I flatter'd my self that far from having lost your Liberty you were free from any Passion This Opinion pleas'd me extremely for although we are of one Sex I must tell you I take delight in gaining the Affections of a young unpractis'd Heart who is unacquainted with Sentiments so destructive to our Peace This made me conceive a particular Friendship for you but I understand your Disdain for some is equal to your Weakness for others Oh what Shame and Disorder do you cause in me replied  Felicia  covering her Face with her Handkerchief I expected in telling you my Secret you wou'd have pitied and consol'd me alas do you upbraid me  Eugenia  Your Severity will compel me hereafter to fear and fly you The unhappy Prince at these Words flung himself on his Knees and taking her Hand kiss'd and bath'd it with Tears his Speech was suppress'd with Sighs which wou'd have been sufficient to discover him were it not that  Felicia  had a strong Opinion of his being of  her own Sex and did not in the least take Notice of his passionate Expressions  Inea  enter'd the Chamber whilst they were in this silent and melancholy Condition What is the Cause of this Sorrow said she Is this the Way  Eugenia  you entertain our dear sick Lady You have without doubt said something to her which renews the Remembrance of her past Misfortunes I have said nothing to  Felicia  interrupted the Prince immediately but what was agreeable to her therefore do not accuse me I wou'd undergo any Pain my self rather than aggravate hers Alas  Inea  said  Felicia  here cruel  Eugenia  has been reproaching me with Sentiments I have for a Person whom she her self wou'd love were she as well acquainted with him as I am No replied  Eugenia  I am convinced of the contrary I even have an invincible Aversion to this unknown who perfidiously robs me of your Heart which is a Crime not to be forgiven This is no Subject to create a Dispute between you and I said  Felicia  the Affection we have for a Lover or a Friend is of so different a Nature that the one does no Prejudice to the other Give me Leave to tell you cry'd the young Prince that when a Heart is touch'd with a powerful Passion it's incapable of receiving any other Impression Then you don't believe I love you  Eugenia  interrupted  Felicia  I know not what to believe replied the Prince but what I am assur'd of is no Creature can be in  greater Despair As he ended these Words  Olympia  enter'd the Chamber  It is given out in the Palace said she that Prince  Abelhamar  having counterfeited a Sickness is gone away secretly in order to assist  Ismael  King of  Tunis  who intends to declare War against the Queen which News has so much alarm'd her that she has given Orders to search his Apartment in spite of what his Physician says to oppose his being seen and if it be possible to penetrate into the Queen's Sentiments by her Uneasiness she is in a great Apprehension concerning the Consequence of this sudden Departure The Queen's Thoughts and mine are as different as our Interest replied  Felicia  she is concern'd at the Prince's being gone and I am overjoy'd at it  Abelhamar  who had not interrupted  Olympia  's Discourse cou'd not help looking earnestly at  Felicia  that Prince is very unfortunate said he that his Absence shou'd give you so much Pleasure I perceive the Love and Respect he has for you meet with a very unkind Return What is become of that Complaisance you show'd us at first my dear  Eugenia  replied  Felicia  you equally blame me for having an Inclination and for not having one I think it wou'd not be reasonable for me to have any other Sentiments for  Abelhamar  and I am even assur'd that if I liked him you your self wou'd condemn me Try Madam continu'd  Eugenia  strive to love the Prince were it only to be reveng'd and to punish me  for my Capriciousness I promise you before it be long I will render his Passion very disagreeable to you I shall not give you that Trouble replied  Felicia  my Constancy might then be brought in Question it is dangerous to make such Tryals These Words sensibly affected  Abelhamar  whose passionate Looks express'd such Emotions that is was surprizing  Felicia Inea  and  Olympia  suspected nothing extraordinary under the Disguise  But what Advantage did the young Prince receive from this Stratagem He saw  Felicia  and daily discover'd some transcendent Charms which inflam'd him the more and increas'd his Despair when he reflected on the Sentiments she had for him for his Passion was not only violent but so nice that he wou'd not have been satisfy'd with the Possession of her Person without that of her Heart and as he knew he had no Share in her Affection it threw him sometimes into such a deep Melancholy as cou'd not be conceal'd Besides the Queen being inform'd of  Abelhamar  's Counterfeit Sickness his going off and part of his Designs gave Orders that those Officers who serv'd him and cou'd give her further Light into the Affair might be taken up and examin'd She was also raising Troops repairing the Fortifications of the Town and taking all Measures necessary to secure her self against the Insults of an Enemy whom she thought already with the King of  Tunis  tho' every Day in her Chamber and sometimes  lying at her Bed's Feet thus the amourous Prince elected his Felicity in a Confinement where he was expos'd to a Danger he did not apprehend and good Fortune was so favourable to him till then that his Disguise did not give the least Cause of Suspicion  Felicia  's Illness tho' extremely violent did not continue long her Youth and good Constitution contributed very much to her speedy Recovery and gave her Strength enough to walk in the Palace Gardens The Court at that Time was so attentive on the Preparations of War that the Slaves were not so strictly watch'd as usual One Day  Felicia Olympia Inea  and our Counterfeit  Eugenia  taking the Air had turn'd their Steps towards a pleasant TerraceWalk which afforded a most agreeable Prospect but the Weather changing there suddenly rose a High Wind succeeded by terrible Thunder and Hail which oblig'd them to run for Shelter into a little SummerHouse that had a View on the Ocean  Felicia  and  Inea  were looking out of a Window and had been some Time observing the Sea which furiously came and broke against the Rocks making a horrid Noise when they perceiv'd a Ship in the greatest Danger she had lost all her Masts and thus toss'd from Wave to Wave was waiting the fatal Moment These young Ladies were moved with Compassion at such a Sight and concern'd for those who were on Board They  implor'd the Assistance of Heaven and whilst they were making Vows for their Safety the Wind decided their Destiny for the Ship was driven ashore and there entirely wreck'd It was a most dismal Scene to see how these unfortunate Wretches strove to save themselves but their Efforts were fruitless they All perished excepting One who was happy enough to reach a little Rock which lay at a small Distance from the Shore  The Storm being allay'd some Fishermen who had seen the Shipwreck took their Boat and row'd towards the Rock where they found the Man I mention'd in a Swoon and as cold as Death they took him and brought him ashoar where they immediately lighted a Fire and gave him all the Help they were capable of  These Things happen'd so near the SummerHouse where our young Captives were retired that they cou'd easily see the Condition this Stranger was in but how great was  Felicia  and  Olympia  's Disorder when they knew him to be the Count of  La Vagne  They wou'd have express'd their Satisfaction were it not for the Fear they were in of his being Dead It is he cried  Olympia  in her first Transports it is certainly himself  Felicia  on the other Side pressing  Inea  and  Eugenia  's Hands cou'd no more be Mistress of her Moderation Oh Heavens said she to them my dearest Companions there is the Man whose Absence has given me so much Displeasure he appears  now just as he did when I found him in the Forest of  Carmona  where he had been attacked by Robbers the Picture of Death was painted on his Face I was then in a Condition to assist him but now alas I am forced to see him perish without being at Liberty to give him any Help  Whilst she was thus speaking to  Inea  and the disguis'd Prince  Olympia  left 'em and ran to a Door adjacent to the SeaSide which she caus'd to be opened without any Difficulty and in a small Time reach'd the Place where the Count was lying As soon as  Felicia  perceived the Concern and Care she express'd in assisting him she knew not what to think I am well perswaded said she they are both Natives of  Genoa  and perhaps Relations but methinks her Affection is very great since she weeps as well as I and embraces him in such a passionate Manner  The mean while  Abelhamar  enrag'd and jealous was acting the greatest Violence on himself in not discovering to her who he was that he might resolve on the immediate Sacrifice of this dangerous Rival  Inea  's Thoughts were also confus'd and she was hardly able to speak a Word The more she consider'd  Olympia  's tender Concern for the Count of  La Vagne  and the secret Consolation she seem'd to derive from his Presence the more she sigh'd and sent her Wishes to her faithful Don  Ramire  in a Word it is not to be conceiv'd how tormented they all were by different Causes of Uneasiness  But how was lovely  Felicia  's Mind employ'd all this while and what were her inward Motions when she saw the Count recovered from his Swoon who appeared in Transports of inexpressible Joy at the Sight of  Olympia  He kiss'd her Hand and fix'd his Eyes on her's as if Fortune had snatch'd him from the Arms of Death only to lead him into perfect Felicity Am I then betray'd cried  Felicia  in a faint Voice and can I believe what I see Is the Count of  La Vagne  in Love with  Olympia  You ought not in the least to doubt it answer'd  Eugenia  who was very willing to confirm her Suspicions and if you flatter'd your self with being belov'd you are mistaken in the Heart of that Traytor any one may see by his Actions that he has a Passion for  Olympia  Do not have so rash an Opinion of him interrupted  Inea  it's probable he has some particular Reasons for acting as he does perhaps the Count is inform'd of Prince  Abelhamar  's Passion for  Felicia  and as he is come in order to ransom his Mistress he thought it convenient to conceal his true Sentiments the better to succeed in his Designs What Pleasure you take in being deceiv'd cried  Eugenia  who cou'd not bear to hear her express her self in this Manner have you already forgot that  Abelhamar  is suspected to be with the King of  Tunis  and consequently there are no Measures to be observ'd with him But the Count knows nothing of it interrupted  Felicia  and I am inclin'd to  believe  Inea  has interpreted the Sentiments of his Heart How great is our Weakness when we love said the Prince we scarcely can credit our own Eyes we are so inclin'd to embrace any Thing which flatters our Wishes Indeed  Eugenia  replied  Felicia  you always represent Things in the falsest Colours What have I done to invite you to take such Delight in tormenting me The Prince who perceiv'd she was displeased said no more to her but resolv'd in himself to make the Force of his Revenge fall on this happy Rival  Olympia  sent to acquaint the Queen that the Count of  La Vagne  was cast on the Shoar but had escaped Death and beg'd Leave to pay his Respects to her Majesty  Celima  who was exceeding melancholy and apprehensive of the Consequences of  Abelhamar  's Revolt declin'd seeing this Stranger not to let him be Witness of her Affliction but sent back to  Olympia  to tell her she might bring him to the Palace where she shou'd have an Apartment prepared for him in One of the remote Pavilions having given Orders that he shou'd be receiv'd with a Distinction equal to his Birth to this she added how willing she shou'd be to admit him were she not indispensibly oblig'd to attend some Affairs of the highest Moment She gave Orders also that they shou'd supply him with all Necessaries and several Slaves immediately brought him Variety of rich Garments that he might please his Fancy Whilst  Olympia  went to return  the Queen Thanks for her Favours the Count was conducted through the Gardens to the Palace  Felicia Inea  and  Eugenia  were walking in an Alley which had a View on the SeaSide when the Count of  La Vagne  came up pretty near to them  Felicia  perceiving him her Heart fluttered and she grew so faint in an Instant that had not  Inea  supported her on one Side and the disguis'd Prince on the other she would not have been able to stand but the Count who had no Cause to remark her Motions tho' in Favour of himself pass'd by the Ladies and only saluted them with much Respect without taking any particular Notice of  Felicia  As soon as he was gone far enough from her not to be heard Oh Heaven cry'd she is it possible he can be so much Master of his Temper as not to show some Tenderness in his Eyes He looks as if he had never seen me What means this Indifference  Inea  Are these his Transports Oh What must I think of his Passion Madam reply'd  Inea  is not his coming hither to fetch you away a sufficient Motive to convince you of his Fidelity  Inea  only deceives you interrupted the Prince for I have seen many Persons in Love and can assure you that altho' they were in a continual Restraint and obliged to be on their Guard in the Presence of jealous Observers yet their Passion discover'd it self in their Eyes and Actions Why continu'd he addressing  himself to  Inea  do you really think the Count of  La Vagne  was overjoy'd to see  Felicia  He did not so much as change Colour nor even fix his Eyes on hers No no his Passion is not so violent as you imagine and if you continue speaking in his Favour you only do it with an Intent to sooth our Friend's Pain Don't torment me in this Manner cruel Creature cry'd  Felicia  am I not unfortunate enough already Why will you persist in saying such vexatious Things to me Have you resolv'd on my Death I take Heaven to Witness reply'd the Prince sighing that I have no such Intention you wou'd certainly judge more favourably of my Sentiments were they well known to you  Felicia  fearing it wou'd be taken Notice of at the Palace that she had been so long Abroad returned speedily to her Chamber which she no sooner enter'd but wrote to the Count in the following Terms  I Have now some Reason to flatter my self that Heaven will soon put a Period to my Misfortunes since Love and Generosity have invited you here to your  Felicia  's Deliverance How shall I express my Joy my Affection and my Gratitude and when shall I be at Liberty to entertain you with my tender Sentiments Alass what Violence did not I do my self in seeing you so near me without speaking to you but how was it possible you cou'd pass by me with such an Air of Indifference I must confess it very much affected  me and if I may tell you my Thoughts I almost suspected your Fidelity I began to fear you had devoted all your Transports to  Olympia  this extremely augmented my Uneasiness being an Effect of my Delicacy which you must pardon Let me know how I am to behave my self hereafter in this Court and don't neglect any Thing to procure us a speedy Departure I hope Fortune will influence the Interest of our Hearts and crown our Sufferings with eternal Felicity  This Letter cou'd not be convey'd to the Count without some Difficulty  Felicia  bid  Inea  read it and conjured her to find Means to have it immediately deliver'd into his Hands I cannot think on any Way reply'd  Inea  but to carry it my self Your self cry'd  Felicia  how will you venture to do it Leave that to me Madam answer'd  Inea  I will run any Risque to serve you This is very generous my dear Companion said  Felicia  then thanked her for so obliging an Offer and desir'd her since she was willing to render her so considerable a Service not to defer it  Olympia  was now in the Queen's Apartment and the Count in his but being extremely impatient to see his lovely Mistress he step'd into the Garden in Expectation of meeting her It was a fine Moonlight Night and as he was walking with his Thoughts wholly employ'd on the Happiness he promis'd himself in the Possession of a Lady for whom he had so transcendent a Passion young  Inea  wraped  in her white Vail accosted him and said read this Letter my Lord it comes from a Person who ought to be dear to you The Count open'd it and was surpriz'd not to know the Writing after having read it over and over without conceiving the Meaning it came into his Head that it was a Jest  Olympia  had imagin'd to divert her self so said to  Inea  I desire you will tell the beauteous Lady from whom I receive this Favour that I intend my self to be Bearer of the Answer  As  Inea  was going back she perceiv'd a Woman at a Distance cover'd with her Vail who was coming towards her and fearing she shou'd be known by her she pass'd on the other Side of the Pallisadoes and went into the long Walk where she found  Felicia  who taking her under the Arm said to her in a low Voice you will think me very impatient to know what the Count has said to you but that is not the only Reason which brought me hither I was looking out of my ChamberWindow waiting your Return when I saw a Woman cross the Garden with great Diligence and go as it were towards the Count's Pavilion I must confess my dear  Inea  it gave me much Uneasiness and I made all possible Haste to follow her As far as I cou'd distinguish she appear'd to me to be  Olympia  and I believe it is her Oh  Inea  how my Heart akes and in what Torment is my Mind for fear of losing the Object of my Love Judge more favourably of the Count said  Inea  interrupting  her he read your Letter with an extreme Attention and addressing me in very obliging Terms assur'd me he wou'd answer it personally It's very well continu'd  Felicia  but let us go on without making a Noise we may perhaps discover where that Person is going whom I mention'd to you In finishing these Words they walk'd on hiding themselves behind the Pallisadoes and hearing some Body talk in an Arbour which was at the End of the Alley they drew near  The Count of  La Vagne  and  Olympia  were conversing together in this Place it is impossible Madam said he to his Mistress for me to express the Despair I was in when I heard of your Death and the Circumstances which preceded it they so intirely affected me that even Life began to be odious to me and never was Mortal in a more desolate Condition But how transported was I at the unexpected Change of Fortune when the Jeweller who had seen you in the Queen's Apartment inform'd me that the same beauteous  Olympia  whose Loss I was deploring was actually living and at  Sallee  judgeI well conceive my dear Count said she interrupting him what might employ your Thoughts in Two such different Occasions as our Affection is mutual we sympathize in all the Pleasure and Torment which derives from our good or bad Fortune you may imagine after what I suffer'd for your supposed Death how excessive was my Joy when I heard of your  Safety I have told you already said the Count that your illustrious Father has given his Consent to our happy Union receiving my Proposals with such extraordinary Marks of Friendship that I must confess I shou'd have suspected so uncommon a Favour were it not that my long Sufferings give me a Title to so great a Reward Yes continu'd he most divine  Olympia  you are now to be mine and I for ever yours As they were speaking in this manner a doleful Voice interrupted them which repeating these Words  I am dying  gave 'em to understand that some Person very near the Arbour was taken ill This induc'd them to discontinue their Conversation tho' ever so delightful in order to assist the Lady who was complaining so dismally  They look'd on every Side without perceiving any one but hearing some Noise behind the Pallisadoes they approach'd and saw  Inea  holding in her Arms  Felicia  in a Swoon Ah my Lord don't come near cry'd  Inea  weeping your Presence wou'd become fatal to  Felicia  and you Madam continu'd she speaking to  Olympia  I beg as a Favour she may not see you What Aversion can she have to us reply'd they both at the same Time We do not know her and it wou'd be strange she shou'd hate us without Cause This is not a proper Time to explain Matters answer'd  Inea  all the Assistance I desire of you is to run to the Palace and send us some Help  Olympia  without making any Reply tho' extremely astonish'd at what she heard went to give Notice to  Eugenia  and some other of the Slaves of the Condition  Felicia  was in and the mean while the Count staid by her No said he to  Inea  I cannot go from you till you have unriddled this Secret to me was it not you that just now gave me a Letter which I do not understand the meaning of One wou'd think by your Air and Words that I had disoblig'd this Fair Lady but alas how cou'd I have done any thing either to deserve her Anger or your Reproaches It's impossible reply'd  Inea  to dissemble better and conceal with more Confidence the horridest Perfidiousness that Man cou'd ever act against a Lady of Birth and Merit Don't expect my Lord that I will explain Things to you which you know better than I The Count of  La Vagne  cou'd not have help'd laughing at so odd and obscure an Answer had not the Condition  Felicia  was in inspired him with great Compassion and finding  Inea  seem'd displeas'd at his remaining there he resolv'd to retire  By this Time several Slaves were come to  Felicia  's Help and among others  Eugenia  or the disguis'd Prince who seeing her in a Swoon express'd his Affliction in Terms so passionate that his Counterfeit was soon discover'd Unfortunate  Eugenia  cry'd he in a doleful Accent thou art going to be depriv'd of the only Object of thy Love  Felicia  my  dear  Felicia  to what a sad State are you reduc'd Divinest Creature if I lose you my Death shall succeed your's since I cannot live without you Whilst he was talking in this manner  Inea  and her Companions were throwing Water on  Felicia  's Face but as their Assistance cou'd not recover her they carry'd her to her Chamber The Prince as you may imagine surpass'd the rest in attending his sick Mistress as soon as she was lain in Bed he sate by her and forgetting himself his excessive Grief forc'd from him such Expressions as were not becoming his Female Disguise  The Governess of the Slaves who watchfully observ'd every thing took Notice of his Words and examining earnestly  Eugenia  's Features discover'd Prince  Abelhamar  's Resemblance She ran immediately and related what had pass'd to the Queen who was not a little surpriz'd at this unexpected Adventure It was late at Night therefore she wou'd not call a Council fearing it might alarm the People who were already under great Apprehensions from the King of  Tunis  's landing so defer'd till next Day taking any Resolution against the Prince  He little knew the Danger which threaten'd him all his Thoughts were then employ'd on the State  Felicia  was in nor cou'd he reflect on any thing more tormenting She scarcely recover'd her Speech but lamented being restor'd to a Life which at that Time all Things render'd burthensome to her  Inea  apprehending  that the Violence of her Affliction wou'd force her into such Complaints as ought to be conceal'd told her Companions who were present that it was convenient  Felicia  shou'd be left to take a little Rest and that  Eugenia  and she wou'd stay by her the others hearing this immediately retired  Felicia  after they were gone gave an entire Course to her excessive Grief see  Inea  cry'd she see what Calamities I labour under I am remote from my Country out of Favour with my Family become a Slave and betray'd by a Man who appear'd to me deserving of every thing he is now in Love with another 'tis  Olympia  he is come to deliver This Lover whom she impatiently expected and receiv'd with so much Joy is the same on whom I bestow'd my tender Care when in a most dangerous Condition and my Solitude afforded him a Refuge from the Fury of his Enemies He conceiv'd a Passion for me engag'd me by a Thousand Promises to make a Return and vow'd his Love shou'd be eternal But Heavens how perfidious has he prov'd I remember now as an Evincement he sacrific'd  Olympia  's Picture to me which perswaded me I had seen her Resemblance before Oh what a sad Object am I of Fortune's Capriciousness Here she was silent a long Time Alas what have I done said she again to deserve at so tender an Age such a Series of Misfortunes Yesterday I was deploring the Absence of the Man I  lov'd this Day I lament the Loss of his Heart Her Sighs and Tears interrupted her several Times whilst she was speaking and at last she cou'd say no more The Prince flattering himself with some small Hopes took this Time to speak to her if you were in a a Condition to taste the Pleasure of Revenge said he you wou'd be soon satisfy'd my Arm shou'd second your Resentment for 'tis no longer in my Power charming  Felicia  to conceal what my excessive Passion for you has made me undertake See at your Feet wretched  Abelhamar  your Slave Here I remain in this Palace for your sake altho' I know that were the Queen inform'd of it my Life wou'd attone for my Crime Compare this Proof of my Love with that of my unworthy Rival's whom you prefer and then you will own your self the most unjust Person in the World  Oh Heavens cry'd  Felicia  can I believe my Eyes What new Fatality doth attend me You here my Lord and an Enemy to the Queen Have you been my Confident and caress'd me by so many Days without my perceiving the Deceit Alas where shall I go for Refuge What must the Queen think of me Will she not have sufficient Reason to suspect my Virtue Can any one imagine that without my Consent you wou'd have made so rash an Attempt Ah nothing but Death can relieve me from my Misfortune  Abelhamar  's Disorder was so great that he did not say much in his Justification and as for  Inea  who  was present at this Scene she cou'd not deny them her Compassion She endeavour'd to excuse him and said to  Felicia  the true Respect the Prince has for you Madam ought in some Measure to appease you since no Body knows of his being disguis'd Your Honour which is dearer to him than his Life and the inevitable Danger that threatens him if the Queen shou'd be inform'd of what has pass'd will engage him to keep secret an Affair of this Importance You are very little acquainted with Mankind interrupted  Felicia  who glory in relating their Adventures and never love so sincerely as to make any Thing a Secret Well my Lord continu'd she addressing herself to the Prince you have made your last Efforts to augment my Miseries I shou'd have dy'd esteem'd by Those who know me but at present shall deserve their Contempt You may go now to the Count of  La Vagne  and tell him that since he has sacrific'd me to  Olympia  I have quitted him for you and contriv'd this criminal Disguise to favour your Admittance Know me better Madam reply'd  Abelhamar  were not my Passion for you transcendent I shou'd never deviate from the Rules of Honour and what I owe you No my  Felicia  you shall never find me guilty of acting any thing that may incur your Displeasure yet I cannot help saying you ought no longer to deplore the Loss of a Man so unworthy your Esteem who without Dispute has deceived you for 'tis impossible if he  once lov'd you he cou'd ever love another Divine  Felicia  be convinc'd of the Power of your Charms and think that I who feel their Effects can never change The present Situation of Affairs gives me Hopes of a happy Turn in my Fortune I may ascend the Throne on which my Ancestors were seated but oh  Felicia  what Pleasure can it afford me to possess a Crown without you I intreat you now to grant a Request you cannot reasonably refuse me which is to forget your perfidious Lover and receive the Vows of the most passionate and most constant of Mankind If you compare my Sentiments with his you will do Justice to my sincere Passion you shall be deliver'd from your Captivity and shall give Laws to the Queen whose Chains you now wear Ah my Lord cry'd  Felicia  in a dejected Tone I desire nothing but Death therefore give me Leave to complain and do not interrupt my Grief with Proposals which I cannot accept I have not Power to forget the Traytor who thus neglects me I love him still spite of all the Reasons I have to hate him and shou'd I be doom'd to sink under my grievous Woes or even live to despise the Author of my present Pain do not think that a Crown cou'd invite me ever to believe perfidious Man again  Abelhamar  heard her with an unconceivable Anguish and had not Strength to make a Reply but look'd at her with the greatest Concern and his Sighs interpreted the tormenting  Motions of his Soul  Felicia  was not in a Condition to observe the Despair this young Prince was reduc'd to but renew'd her Complaints and nothing cou'd restrain the Course of her Tears What are you doing Madam said  Inea  to her Is it possible that a Person so charming shou'd regret the Loss of a Man who even disowns you and abandons you to go away with  Olympia  Is it thus he ungratefully repays the obliging Sentiments you have for him Call Revenge to your Aid Madam forget a Man who forsakes you and let your Disdain be the Reward of his Falsity It is easy my Dear reply'd  Felicia  to give Advice on such an Occasion I wou'd do the same to you were you in my Case and I in your's But do you think it is in our Power to act as we please when Love has once render'd himself Master of our Inclinations Ah cruel Rival what Torment do you give me And you perfidious Count shall not I see you punish'd for your Ingratitude Imploy my Arm Madam interrupted the Prince and with your Consent I will revenge you of your perjur'd Lover I wou'd sooner resolve to die said  Felicia  than yield to so inhuman a Proposal the only Favour I desire of you my Lord which I conjure you not to deny me is that you will leave me you are no longer  Eugenia  you are a Prince whom I dare not admit at this Time of Night into my Chamber my Peace and Honour depend on your Compliance Think of the Danger you expose  your self to for a Person who can make you no Return That is the only Misfortune I fear interrupted  Abelhamar  every Thing else might be easily surmounted Retire my Lord reply'd  Felicia  I am extremely uneasy at your being here The Prince perceiving it was in vain to resist withdrew but not without assuring her that altho' he were to suffer innumerable Torments thro' her Indifferency yet his Passion shou'd ever be the same  Olympia Doria  all that Evening had not found an Opportunity to speak to the Count of  La Vagne  which made her pass the rest of that Night in such an Agitation of Mind as troubled the Joy she ought to have receiv'd at so agreeable a Change in her Fortune What means said she  Felicia  's swooning away and  Inea  's Anger cou'd they have such Motions for a Stranger Yet the Count pretends not to know them and this Dissimulation seems to me very Criminal how can I tell whether in his Travels he did not come acquainted with this young Lady and who can assure me they do not love each other These melancholy Thoughts tormented her cruelly and the Count on his Side was not less uneasy fearing  Olympia  wou'd let her self be deceiv'd by Appearances for tho' he cou'd not penetrate into this Mystery he saw enough to make him apprehend it might give his Mistress some Suspicion and as his Passion for her invited him to prefer Death to her Displeasure he impatiently waited for Morning to undeceive her  As they had an equal Desire to entertain one another they rose early and met on the TerraceWalk  Olympia  the better to know the Count's Sentiments endeavour'd to conceal her Uneasiness but her Melancholy soon discover'd her secret Thoughts The Count also appear'd so dejected that one might easily imagine what pass'd in his Soul He broke Silence first and ask'd her how she had repos'd To which she answer'd with Indifferency that she had rested very ill without knowing the Cause Here  Olympia  's Sighs interrupted her Discourse Ah Madam said the Count prostrating himself at her Feet do not let me be long uncertain of my Destiny you are not the same you were Yesterday what have I done to deserve from you so cold a Reception I have not Resolution enough to be silent reply'd  Olympia  tho' it was my Design it is unjust to harbour Suspicions of the Person one loves without coming to an Eclaircisement Tell me my Lord Do you still love  Felicia  I say still because after what has pass'd I have no Reason to doubt but you once had a Passion for her The Count wou'd not let  Olympia  persevere in an Error which was to the Prejudice of his Honour he scon by his Protestations perswaded her of the contrary then offer'd to go with her to justify himself before  Felicia  and  Inea  I believe you my Lord said she without such a Proof since I had much rather you shou'd not see 'em any more The Queen has consented to  our leaving this Place therefore let us go for the Approach of the King of  Tunis  terrifies me It wou'd be very unfortunate shou'd we find our selves besieg'd here at a Time that my Father is dispos'd to favour us Let us depart reply'd the transported Count there is nothing I wish so much I have a Ship now ready to sail for  Italy  and only waits for a favourable Wind may Heavens protect our Voyage and bring me to my long wish'd for Happiness come Madam added he dispose all Things for your Departure every Moment will seem to me an Age till  Hymen  has crown'd my Love with the Union of our Destinies  These endearing Expressions highly pleas'd  Olympia  who immediately went to the Queen and obtain'd Leave to embark  Celima  at the same Time restor'd to their Liberty the young Slaves that were taken with  Olympia  then presented her with her Picture set round with Diamonds of great Value and repeated to her what she had already said in Behalf of the Count of  La Vagne  withal that at another Time she shou'd have been very glad to see him  Olympia  having return'd her Acknowledgments in a most respectful Manner went into the Slaves Apartment where she chose the Ladies I mention'd and took her Leave of the rest who by their Tears and Caresses shew'd the particular Affection they had for her As she doubted whether it were proper to see  Felicia  she desir'd the Governess of the  Slaves to acquaint her with her Departure but at the Name of  Olympia  and the News of her going away she fetch'd a Shriek and made such Complaints as wou'd have inspir'd the hardest Heart with Pity  Olympia  hearing this wou'd not aggravate her Pain by her Presence and tho' she passionately wish'd to entertain  Felicia  that she might know from her whether the Count of  La Vagne  was sincere in what he had told her yet she was no ways willing to satisfy her self at the Expence of so amiable a Person  The Count was expecting  Olympia  with Impatience when she came to tell him the Favours she had receiv'd from the Queen who order'd some of her Officers to accompany them to the Ship The mean while  Felicia  oppress'd with Sorrow continu'd lamenting with  Inea  I have no Hopes left said she to her my Fate is decreed the ungrateful Count of  La Vagne  is now going off and I shall lose him for ever he flies me and carries with him the Object of his Love the Barbarian cou'd see me dying without being touch'd nay he even deny'd me his Pity and the deplorable Condition that perfidious Man has reduc'd me to has not cost him a Sigh Ah leave me and let me die with Grief and Shame Don't indulge your Affliction Madam interrupted  Inea  think only that he who leaves you is unworthy of the Tears you shed reflect on his Ingratitude and it will be an effectual Way to forget him You are deceiv'd  if you believe it said  Felicia  sighing when one is inspir'd with a Passion the Loss of its Object wholly employs our Thoughts I protest to you with some Confusion that all the good Qualities I knew in that inconstant Lover appear to me now with greater Lustre tho' I can no longer doubt of his Infidelity or my Misfortune and to let you see more of my Weakness I have a pressing Desire to write to him in Hopes my Reproaches might move him What Madam interrupted  Inea  cou'd you receive his Devoirs again after such an injurious Proceeding Alas reply'd  Felicia  what are not we capable of acting to recall a Heart whose Possession is dear to us Then don't add to my Pain I too well comprehend what you think and blush to see my Honour concern'd But consider I am an unhappy distracted Creature My Dear I conjure you in the Name of your faithful Don  Ramire  to find some Person that will deliver a Letter to the Count of  La Vagne  you cannot confer a greater Obligation on me  Inea  who was very willing to serve  Felicia  left her immediately in order to make an Attempt but soon after she return'd and told her it was impossible to send any Body to the Port that the Queen had either receiv'd News of  Ismael  's Approach or that something extraordinary was passing at Court since she had commanded the Guards of her Palace to be doubled and the Gates to be shut that none might be admitted without her Order  Then I must lose all Hopes cry'd unfortunate  Felicia  for I can neither stop him nor follow him Just Heaven revenge me on that perjur'd Man punish his Perfidiousness punish the Cause of this last Misfortune may the angry Waves swallow them up and let me hear the News of their Loss soon after that of their Departure But alas am I capable of forming Wishes so contrary to my Inclination No I have lov'd the Count too well ever to hate him then let him live and be happy All my Fury ought to be turn'd against my self for I deserve the Miseries I now linger in Had I instead of leaving my Father's House submitted to his Commands I shou'd not at present have the cruel Mortification of reproaching my self with an imprudent Conduct which I never shall be able to justify to the World While  Felicia  is thus deploring the Cruelty of her Fortune we must return to the Prince of  Carency  Casilda  had maliciously perswaded him that  Benavidez  was gone with  Leonida  to  Jaen  where he wou'd be sure as she said of the Governour's Protection A Man must certainly have as much Valour as Love to attempt any thing against a Person who was protected by the Governour of so considerable a Place but the Violence of his Passion and Extremity of his Despair together wou'd not permit him to reflect even on the greatest of Dangers  Whereever he pass'd People observ'd something extraordinary in him and tho' his Eyes express'd much Grief his Noble Mein carry'd Marks of the Highest Distinction He made the strictest Enquiry after  Felicia  of  Leon  whom sometimes he call'd  Leonida  of  Velasco  but when he describ'd her to those he apply'd to he was so lavish in her Praise that they easily discover'd he was her Lover  Notwithstanding all his Care and Diligence his Pursuit was in vain for she had not pass'd that Way nor cou'd any one give him the least Intelligence concerning her He began to be very uneasy and hurrying from one Thought to another his Mind was fill'd with his past Misfortunes till he came to  Jaen  where he arriv'd exceeding melancholy He look'd on the Citadel of that Town as a Place where his Life and Disasters were to be terminated Here said he here I expect to see the ungrateful Beauty I adore and before her Eyes I will attack the ungenerous Man who next her self had the first Place in my Heart What a strange Destiny is this cry'd he My Mistress and my Friend equally betray me and to satisfy my Resentment I must destroy the One to wound the Other It is probable they are this fatal Hour contriving my Ruin and giving each other fresh Assurances of eternal Love but my Death must confirm their Felicity for whilst I am living they have a cruel Enemy who will endeavour to defeat their Projects and ever trouble the Happiness they propose  At his Arrival he had a mind to go directly to the Citadel for as I told you before he had accepted of a Letter from the Governour of  Carmona  to his Son Don  Gabriel d' Aguillar  by whose Interest he was sure of an easy Entrance into the Place but he thought it was better first to send to him and the mean Time inform himself of what pass'd there As he was going thro' the Town he met a  French  Chevalier of the House of  Boucicault  his Name was  Alphonso  a Person of an obliging Temper who came to  Seville  with the Count of  La March  What do I see Is it you my Lord cry'd he coming up to the Prince with a great deal of Joy and Respect are you living whom we so much lamented with the Prince your Brother believing you were assassinated near  Carmona  as it was reported in  Spain  and for which we were meditating a proportionable Revenge I shou'd have been happy my Dear  Alphonso  said the Prince had my Enemy's Designs been effected but I am reserv'd for greater Calamities yet I desire my Name may be kept secret for important Reasons which engage me to conceal it and you can be very serviceable to me I am in love and betray'd and must revenge my self on my Rival and my Mistress Oh how I shall load  Felicia  with my just Reproaches She is now in the Citadel with him What you say is true my Lord interrupted  Alphonso  I know it from Don  Gabriel d' Aguillar  who is one of my particular Friends  Felicia  is confin'd against her Will in an Apartment where she sees no Body but by the Means of the  Spanish  Captain I have already mentioned one Night without being perceiv'd I saw her sadly deploring her Fate Oh my Lord how Young and Handsom she is I must confess I extremely pity her  Do you pity her said the Prince with a deep Sigh Have you any Compassion for her Ah you are little acquainted with her Perfidiousness but tell me what means that manner of Confinement Did not you see her come here with Don  Fernand Benavidez  the Governour's Nephew No reply'd  Alphonso  the Person you name has not appear'd here since my Arrival for as I am every Day at the Citadel I shou'd probably have seen him yet if he be there he certainly keeps himself conceal'd Ah the Traitor cry'd the Prince he is only hid for  Felicia  's sake and without doubt has desir'd a Guard to protect him from my Resentment The Villain has sufficient Reason to fear me it is dangerous to insult a desperate Man who does not value his Life This Thought made the Prince fly into so violent a Passion that  Alphonso  beg'd of him to retire from the Place where they were standing for fear they might be observ'd  The Prince said to him if you will prevent my committing any Extravagancies you must second the Desire I have of seeing  Benavidez  and  Felicia  I have a Letter for Don  Gabriel d'Aguillar  who I am glad to hear is your  Friend you will oblige me extremely in sending instantly to him that we may take necessary Measures for that purpose  Alphonso  promis'd the Prince every thing that depended on him even at the Hazard of his Life then left him to execute his Orders  Whatever Enquiry  Alphonso  and Don  Gabriel  made before they came to the Prince they cou'd learn nothing satisfactory those to whom they apply'd concerning Don  Fernand Benavidez  told 'em they believ'd he was at  VillaReal  but that he was not Nephew to Don  Alonzo Fajardo  and that no body had seen him at  Jaen  where hardly any one knew him When they brought this Account to the Prince he cou'd not believe 'em Since  Felicia  is in the Citadel interrupted he 'tis a certain Consequence  Benavidez  is not far do you only contrive that I enter her Apartment it is likely he will come there when every body is retired Don  Gabriel  told him he shou'd be obey'd then went to receive Orders from the Governour who named him for  Felicia  's Guard at Night he came back to the Prince to conduct him and  Alphonso  to the Citadel  Now can any Mortal imagine the Trouble this amorous Prince was in when he thought he was sure to see the Object he still ador'd he resolv'd his Rival shou'd perish tho' he himself were to fall with him which violent Reflection made him sigh deeply especially when he consider'd that this same  Felicia  was  Leonida  of  Velasco  to whom he was so strictly engag'd that his Honour wou'd not suffer any other to carry her off  He was in this Confusion of Thought where Love and Revenge were equally concern'd when Don  Gabriel  conducted him through several Courts till at last he brought him to the Tower where  Felicia  was conceal'd in a low Apartment the Windows were bar'd with IronGrates and the Weather being excessive hot she had obtain'd leave to walk on the Leads of the Tower for the Air the Prince took that Opportunity to enter a Closet which was only shut with a Glass Door and there hid himself behind the Window Curtain from whence he could see all that passed He was not there long before the Lights were taken away and he heard two Persons creep into the Closet they spoke very low and the Night being dark he could not distinguish whether they were Men or Women soon after they went out of the Closet where the Prince thought himself alone but the Lights being brought in again he saw several Women who were preparing a Bath They hung a Canopy of rosecolour'd Sattin embroider'd with Silver over a large black Marble Vessel which they fill'd with Water and Flowers mix'd with the finest Perfumes  Every thing being ready a Lady came in to whom the rest of the Women shewed much Respect but he could not see her Face her Head being covered with a fine Veil this was  Felicia  who having undressed her self to  a thin NightGown ordered all her Women to retire excepting  Zaida  then called for her Lute saying Musick only can sooth my dear Afflictions Ah  Zaida Zaida  could he for whom I suffer hear these Verses how pleased should I be Soon after she sung the ensuing Words with so sweet a Voice that none cou'd hear her without being inchanted  WHY shou'd Virtue thus torment me  Oh unkind and cruel Law  Or why shou'd fantastick Duty  Strike my tender Heart with Awe    Love take pity of my Anguish  To my soft Distress be kind  Never let the fair One languish  When to Tenderness inclin'd  She repeated the last Stanza several times and fetch'd now and then deep Sighs which shew'd her Heart was possess'd with a mighty Passion as well as excessive Grief The Prince all this while perceiv'd it was not the Voice of his unconstant  Felicia  or at least was surpriz'd that the small distance which was between them shou'd cause so great an Alteration in her Tone as not to know it again Do not afflict your self Madam said  Zaida  great Passions are ever influenc'd by Fortune he whom you love is at present inform'd of what you suffer do you think he will attempt  nothing to evince you of his Affection  Felicia  made no Reply but order'd her to shut her Chamber Door and went into the Bath How entirely do I love you cruel  Leonida  said the amorous Prince to himself But Oh ungrateful Woman ought not I to be ashamed of my Weakness For let me look upon you as a Person to whom I am contracted or as a Mistress I love to Distraction you have equally deceiv'd me under the Titles of  Carency  and  La Vagne  Ah perfidious Creature you are now proposing to surmount all Difficulties in order to marry  Benavidez  Cou'd there be a Complaint more passionate than that which you just now utter'd But continued he what must I believe Are her Designs travers'd Here I see her a Prisoner in a Place where she thought to find a Sanctuary she even regrets the Absence of her Lover and every thing seems to disappoint their Expectations  Such were the Prince's Reflections and in spite of his Resentment Love still triumph'd in his Heart but in what surprize was he when  Zaida  opening the Door of another Closet he drew the Curtain and saw a Man going with Precipitation to the bathing Vessel where he put himself on his Knees and spoke so low that his Voice cou'd not reach the Prince who only heard  Felicia  cry aloud is it you my dear Lover then she swooned away  The Prince of  Carency  seeing this cou'd no longer refrain but without thinking on the Consequence of the Scene he was going to open ran out of the Closet like a Madman and had he been capable of taking any base Advantage it was in his power to run him he took for  Benavidez  thro' the Body before the other cou'd even put himself in a Posture of Defence for  Felicia  's Swoon had such an extraordinary Effect upon him that he did not see the Prince who was just at his Back till hearing some body threatening him with a furious Tone he rose and drew his Sword but the Prince seeing his Face immediately drop'd the Point of his knowing him to be Don  Alonzo  eldest Son to the Infanta Don  Fernand  he had seen him at  Seville  when he was there with his Brother the Count of  La March  and the fine Qualities of this young Prince had engag'd the Prince of  Carency  to have a great Esteem for him he cast his Eyes on her whom he took for  Leonida  and knew her to be Dona  Felicia d' Ayala  Daughter to the Great Chancellor of  Castille  who was highly distiguish'd by his Birth and renown'd for the Histories of Don  Pedro  and Don  Henriquez  Kings of  Spain  which he had written This Grandee being dead  Felicia  was brought up with the two Princesses Daughters to the Infanta Don  Fernand  Don  Alonzo  who saw her often conceiv'd so great a Passion for her that every one suspected he wou'd marry her privately and to prevent so unequal a Match whilst Don  Alonzo  was one  Day a hunting the Infanta his Father had order'd that  Felicia  shou'd be secretly conveyed to  Jean  where she was to be carefully guarded All the Women who attended her were at the Infanta's Devotion and by the Death of the Chancellor her Father she was delivered up entirely to the Persecutions of those who envy'd her As for  Zaida  she was a Slave whom  Felicia  had made a Christian and one they did not mistrust not reflecting she had been presented to her by Don  Alonso  This young Prince at his Return to  Seville  was in a despairing Condition when he heard his Mistress was gone and tho' he learn'd but very confusedly the Manner of her being carry'd off and confin'd in a strong Place yet invited by his Passion he Day and Night us'd his utmost Endeavour to recover her having at last discover'd his dear  Felicia  's Concealment and found Means to write to  Zaida  who answer'd his Letter the Affair was so well manag'd that without  Felicia  's Knowledge he got into her Apartment  The Prince of  Carency  perceiving his Error in order to repair it presented Don  Alonso  with his Sword the Point towards his own Breast Punish an unhappy Man said he whom you will oblige in taking away his Life By my Words you may judge of the Concern I am in for having disturb'd this charming Interview which to obtain it's probable my Lord you have expos'd your self to some Danger but be assur'd I suffer more  than you thro' this Mistake I do not resent it in the least my Lord reply'd Don  Alonzo  embracing him and if you will promise to keep this Secret you shall ever find me a grateful Friend The Prince of  Carency  gave him his Word he wou'd never take the least Notice of what had happen'd and without staying till  Felicia  was come to her self he left the Chamber in so deep a Despair that he cou'd scarcely speak to  Gabriel d Aguilar  who was at the Door of the first Room with  Alphonso  and this last attended him to Don  Gabriel  's Apartment who was oblig'd to remain in his Post  The Prince having an Opportunity of yielding himself up to his just Sorrow call'd to mind all his Misfortunes from his first appearing in the World to that Moment on whatever Side he turn'd his Eyes he saw so little Hopes of an Intermission that every thing became indifferent to him and he did not even wish himself a better Fortune All his Thoughts were fix'd on being reveng'd of  Benavidez  which he fancy'd was the only Satisfaction he cou'd receive but as it appear'd almost impossible it extremely added to his Grief Oh  Alphonso  said he can any Disappointment be equal to this I was in Hopes to punish a Traitor and recover my Mistress but that fatal Name of  Felicia  has again deceived me What unaccountable Circumstances have attended my Life Fate has singled me amongst all Mankind to be unfortunate  Where must I go to find the Treasure I have lost Alas my  Leonida  is not here and I discover too late  Casilda  's wicked Plot How cou'd I believe that she wou'd have told me where her Brother was gone If I had made the least Reflection I might have expected she wou'd deceive me Ah Credulous Wretch that I was I have lost an Opportunity I shall never retrieve again Just Heaven my Rival is now safe with  Leonida  and he peaceably enjoys a Blessing which belongs to me Can I after this survive my Shame and Despair In short the Prince's Condition was such that nothing cou'd give him Relief his Complaints were moving and Love appear'd in all his Actions  Alphonso  who knew by Experience the Torments that attend transcendent Passions extremely pity'd this unhappy Prince Oh Love cry'd he will you never cease persecuting us You alone cause all our Misfortunes and never grant a Favour that is not preceded by a Thousand Disappointments Ah Why have we no Fence against your Power The Prince whilst he was talking continued in a deep Silence and  Alphonso  finding he was not dispos'd to converse with him meditated some time then wrote these Verses  LOVE thou dear but cruel Tyrant  Can nothing move thee to be kind  Hear my Sighs and see my Torment  For only Thou canst ease my Mind    Since all are doom'd to feel thy Darts  At least suspend our Pains  With tender Pity bless those Hearts  That languish in thy Chains  The Prince read these Lines and said One cou'd have no room to complain if in Love there were an equal mixture of Pleasure and Pain but alas I have experienc'd that all its Ills are reserv'd for me which makes me wish a Period to my unhappy Life Ah my Lord interrupted  Alphonso  do not harbour a Thought so offensive to your Courage 'Tis unworthy a Soul so great as your's shou'd yield to a Passion which will divert you from the Performance of great Exploits The Prince blush'd at what  Alphonso  said and look'd on this Discourse as a Reproach made him for the time he had employ'd in entertaining his amorous Sentiments You shall see by my Conduct reply'd he that my Soul is still my own I love 'tis true and cannot flatter myself with ever being disengag'd from a Passion which has so great an Empire over me yet when Honour calls me I am ready to attend and if I must give up my Life it shall be in so glorious a way as will do Honour to my Name  Here they where both silent some time till the Prince urg'd by disagreeable Thoughts broke out into his usual Complaints Oh  Alphonso  said he which way shall I direct my Course to find  Leonida  I cannot hear where  she is must I then turn Knight Errant and run through the World without knowing where to go No I have a nobler Resolution I will return to  Seville  and there follow my Brother's Fortune if we engage the  Moors  I must conquer or bravely die  Alphonso  overjoy'd to hear the Prince speak in these Terms applauded a Design so worthy of him Consider my Lord said he that all you cou'd do at present for  Leonida  wou'd meet with no Return for since she flies you 'tis proable you are the Object of her Aversion at least her going off with  Benavidez  is a Proof she loves him and is perfidious to you What can you then expect from her Rather strive to deface the Impression she has made that in time you may even lose the Remembrance of having ever known her I ought to take your Advice indeed interrupted the Prince but alas how is it possible Fortune may be inconstant but my Heart can never change Thus irresolute not knowing what to determine he conjur'd  Alphonso  not to discover who he was nor acquaint the Count of  La March  with his being at  Jaen  till he had fix'd a Resolution The Chevalier promis'd him upon Honour to keep the Secret inviolably and beg'd he wou'd not be uneasy on that Subject  Whilst these things pass'd in relation to the Prince of  Carency  the Count of  La March  his Brother neglected no opportunity of signalizing himself He had not been long at  Seville  when the  Moors  besieg'd  Baëca  with Seven Thousand Horse and a Hundred Thousand Foot so formidable an Army struck Terror throughout  Andalusia  but as the Place was well fortify'd the  Moors  despair'd of its Reduction when they receiv'd Advice that the  Spaniards  from all parts were assembled in order to relieve it therefore they suddenly retir'd loaded with the Plunder of the Neighbouring Villages They were not more fortunate at Sea where they had considerable Losses by the  Spanish  Fleet which had engag'd their's and gain'd a compleat Victory This Advantage gave no small Satisfaction to the  Spaniards  who now thought of acting offensively The Infanta call'd a General Council of all the Officers of the Army where it was resolv'd to besiege  Zahara  The besieg'd defended the Town bravely till the want of Necessaries made 'em capitulate Soon after he took another of their strongest Places which so exasparated  Mahomet  King of  Granada  that he immediately thought on Revenge and in order to carry on his Design put himself at the Head of Six Thousand Horse and Eighty Thousand Foot dividing them into several Bodies which took different Routs for their March and all on a sudden besieg'd  Jaen  whilst they thought him imploy'd elsewhere  His Approach surpriz'd the Governour who was not prepar'd for a Siege and wou'd have been under greater Difficulties were he not assisted by the Prince of  Carency  who had not yet  left the Town and was rejoyc'd to have so fine an Occasion of distinguishing himself He had been presented to  Alonzo Fajardo  under the Title of Count of  La Vagne  and having offer'd his Services to him the other readily accepted of 'em This young Prince put himself at the Head of a Detachment and by his frequent Sallies often broke the Enemies Measures and repuls'd 'em where ever he appear'd carrying Death and Terror along with him As his Neglect of Life made him expose himself to the greatest Dangers he became dreadful to his Enemies who knowing him by his Arms chose rather to avoid his Blows than resist him The Governour of  Jaen  admired his Courage and thought Heaven had sent him to defend that City against the Infidels  The King of the  Moors  enrag'd at his ill Success and attributing the Cause to the Prince of  Carency  whom they call'd the Knight of the black Arms order'd some of the bravest of his Army either to kill or take him Prisoner so immediately the Generals and most of the Noblemen made a League to be reveng'd of this terrible Enemy or perish in the Attempt A Detachment was sent out the next Day much superior to that under the Prince's Command Nevertherless he attack'd them and his Courage surpass'd all that can be imagin'd The  Moors  were beginning to repent their rash Undertaking when unluckily the Prince's Horse was wounded by an Arrow and before he cou'd disengage himself they  rush'd upon him with a Shout and took him Prisoner This News ran thro' the Camp and soon found way into the Town where it had a different Effect  Mahomet  thought now he had conquer'd and the Governour believ'd himself overcome The Barbarians were resolv'd to make a general Assault and the Christians were preparing to defend themselves tho' most of the Soldiers were mightily dishearten'd saying to one another what can we pretend to We have lost the Count of  La Vagne  commanded by him we might have defeated our Enemies but his Misfortune is the Presage of ours  At this time the Infanta omitted nothing for the Succour of  Jaen  He assembled his Troops with great Diligence and march'd towards the Town with the Count of  La March  where he surpriz'd the  Moors  who retir'd with more Shame than Glory satisfying themselves with burning and pillaging wherever they pass'd The  Spaniards  pursu'd them as far as  Malaga  which they besieg'd in their turn The Infanta was inform'd by Don  Alonso Fajardo  of the young Count of  La Vagne  's being taken Prisoner by  Mahomet  as for his Friend  Alphonso  he was kill'd in one of the Engagements which was the Cause that the Count of  La March  heard nothing of the Prince of  Carency  's being there The mighty Character of his Bravery and the Recital of the great Actions he had perform'd gave the Infanta a particular Concern for his Misfortune  he sent an Officer with Proposals for the Exchange of Prisoners and offer'd a Ransom for the Count of  La Vagne  being willing to purchase his Liberty at any rate but all he cou'd do to get him out of his Enemies Power was in vain the  Moors  made Answer that the Count having brib'd his Guards had made his Escape and that were he still in their Hands they wou'd readily send him back to shew how desirous they were to oblige the Infanta  The King of  Granada  in the mean time was of Opinion that he cou'd not too strictly guard a Person who had been very troublesome to him during the Siege therefore Policy and Revenge having an equal share in this Design he order'd that the Prince tho' dangerously wounded shou'd be convey'd to the Castle of  Solobrena  where his Brother Prince  Joseph  with his two Sons  Mahomet  and  Osmin  were kept Prisoners so the Prince of  Carency  found himself a second time in the Power of the Infidels but his Sentiments were quite different from those he had at  Nicopolis  for that which at another time wou'd have given him much Chagrin had now very little Effect on him all his Thoughts being only imploy'd on  Leonida  and every thing else below his Consideration yet it was an unhappy State for a Man to love an Object whom he Thought guilty of the greatest Perfidiousness  Whilst this was the State of Affairs in Upper  Andalusia  and  Murcia Celima  Queen of  Fez  was taking Measures to be reveng'd of  Abelhamar Felicia  had but just oblig'd him to leave her Chamber when the Queen impatient to have her Designs executed caus'd him to be seiz'd by a Captain of her Guards who carry'd him immediately to a Tower adjoyning the Palace and having posted a Guard at every Gate to hinder People from coming near the Queen went to him soon after  Abelhamar  did not appear the least surpriz'd at his Confinement he said to this Princess My Sentiments Madam are not unknown to you since you are inform'd of the Love I have for  Felicia  I have not acted any thing contrary to the Allegiance and Respect I owe you and tho' you find me disguis'd in your Palace it wou'd not consist with Justice to draw an ill Consequence from an Action that is only the Effect of my Passion to which you can impute no other Crime but that of Indiscretion I know too well your Intentions interrupted the Queen in a fierce Tone to let myself be deceiv'd by your Wit or Metamorphosis No Prince you were here conspiring against me the rebellious Principles you were brought up in cou'd never receive a grateful Sentiment or teach you what you owe your Sovereign Have I not preserv'd your Life without regard to the Reasons of State which ought to have induced me to sacrifice you Yet ungrateful as you are have you liv'd hitherto with the hopes of making  me a Victim Cruel  Ismael  also seconds your Design and has promis'd you Forces in order to dethrone me You prefer a Stranger to a Queen of your own Blood to whom you owe every thing but Heaven that protects me has put me in a Condition to punish you and be reveng'd of my Enemies Satisfy yourself Madam reply'd the Prince with a haughty Air and don't slight so fine an Opportunity of taking away a Life which is odious to you Paint my Innocence in the vilest Colours or rather say the legal Right I have to the Crown you wear is my only Crime and that as you have ever born an invincible hatred to the unhappy Remainders of my Family you have resolv'd to compleat what your unjust Father had begun Rash Man cry'd  Celima  do you think of what you are saying Dare you pronounce these Words before the Queen your Mistress Don't you know your Death waits my Command Is it thus you endeavour to justify your self and appease me You don't consider the Danger you are in  Abelhamar  made no Reply to her Threats nor gave the least Attention to her whilst she was speaking but rather acted like one who despising Mercy did not regret the Life he was going to be depriv'd of which unconcern'd Behaviour surpriz'd the Queen who retired full of Resentment  Celima  had already given orders that  Felicia  and  Inea  shou'd be strictly guarded in their Chambers and that none of their Companions  shou'd be admitted to them This new Misfortune did not add to  Felicia  's Concern for every thing was now become so indifferent to her that she did not even enquire into the Cause  The Queen being return'd to the Palace call'd her Council and appointed Persons to examine the Prince because she wou'd shew some Form in an Affair which might draw upon her the Aversion of her Relations and particularly that of the  Maliquez Alabez  who were also descended from the antient Kings of  Fez  and at that time very potent in the Kingdom of  Granada  This induc'd her to give the blackest Colours to the Crime with which they were going to charge  Abelhamar  and tho' she took the best Measures to conceal the Design she had against him yet his faithful  Mula  who was just return'd from  Tunis  where he had carry'd Credentials to  Ismael  from the Prince us'd his utmost Application to serve him he had to good a Correspondence in the Palace not to be inform'd of every thing that pass'd there in relation to the unfortunate Prince and as he perceiv'd the occasion was pressing he wou'd lose no time to give immediate assistance to his Master who otherways wou'd fall a Sacrifice to  Celima  He went to all  Abelhamar  's Friends and Slaves and prepar'd them to assemble in order to raise the City in his Favour by which means he hoped to restore him to his Liberty or put all to Fire and Sword that wou'd oppose it These  were his Resolutions till he reflected that the Queen had a great many Creatures devoted to her Service as well as a strong Garrison and that the People being us'd to her Government wou'd strive to maintain it therefore he thought it more prudent to return to  Tunis  and apply himself to  Ismael  who wou'd imploy his utmost Power in this important Affair so he set out again from  Sallee  and soon arriv'd at  Ismael  's Court  His Grief and Affection furnish'd him with Expressions of so great a Force that the King of  Tunis  was extreamly touch'd at  Abelhamar  's Misfortunes and being already exasperated against  Celima  he resolv'd immediately to assist that Prince With this Intent he order'd his Troops to be drawn out of their Garrisons and review'd then sent an Ambassador to the King of  Morocco  to renew his Treaty of Alliance with him to prevent that Prince in his Absence from making any Irruptions into his Territories  After having dispos'd every thing with as much Wisdom as Diligence he open'd the Campaign and  Mula  return'd privately to  Sallee  to perform what he had first resolv'd for the Safety of his Master  The young Prince being examin'd refus'd at first to make a Reply but when they told him unless he answer'd to the Accusation he shou'd receive Sentence the sooner it oblig'd him to make a Defence in Expectation of being reliev'd by  Ismael  and whatever mind the Queen had to forward his Tryal she cou'd  not proceed to a Condemnation without exposing herself to inevitable Dangers The first Officers of the Crown and Lords of the Court represented to her that she cou'd not take too much Precaution in an Affair of this Importance and that it wou'd be more to her Glory to let Clemency take Place of Justice we believe the Prince is culpable said they since he was found disguis'd in the Palace which is a sufficient Proof yet without Regard to his Youth as he is presumptive Heir to the Crown and of your Blood Madam he ought to have some Respect shewn him therefore we beg that your Majesty for your own Interest will consider these Reasons separately and by suspending your Resentment shew Mercy to the Prince  The Queen was displeas'd at a Request which shew'd that  Abelhamar  had more Friends than she imagin'd and fearing they shou'd take Measures to rescue her Prisoner she wou'd no longer consult Reason but resolv'd to do every thing by her own Authority without taking any Advice of her Council so having prevented those appointed to judge the Prince she herself pronounc'd the Sentence of his Death and to deter seditious Persons from caballing against her she order'd that he shou'd be executed on the PlatForm of the Court wherein he was confin'd that every Body might see him suffer  In this Place they built a Scaffold hung with Mourning and set round with Standards  and Scutcheons which with other dismal Preparations drew Numbers of Spectators The Prince was soon after inform'd of his Fate this News at first very much surpriz'd him his Eyes express'd an extraordinary Grief and he was some time without speaking at last lifting up his Hands Oh Heaven he cry'd you know my Disguise was not criminal and that this is only a pretext the unjust Queen takes to destroy me but since you have decreed my Doom I am ready to obey without repining and if  Celima  grants me one Favour I shall die with Content Then turning himself to the Captain of the Guards he said go tell the Queen from me that I beg leave to bid an eternal Adieu to charming  Felicia  the Minutes I shall pass with her will be too short to retard the inhuman Designs of  Celima  The Officer went directly to the Queen who was very unwilling to grant the Prince his Request but her Ministers having represented to her in respectful Terms how cruel it wou'd be to refuse so small a Satisfaction to a Person in his Condition she at last consented that  Felicia  shou'd be brought to him She was till then a Stranger to the Prince's Misfortune being strictly confin'd with  Inea  and as her Confinement did not in the least disturb her she never enquired why they added this new Rigour to her Captivity Her Mind was entirely taken up with the Count of  La Vagne  and the Tears she shed were only for his Inconstancy and Absence every thing else that  happen'd had no Effect on her and she was in this Disposition when she was sent for by the Queen's Orders She follow'd the Governess of the Slaves without asking any Question  Inea  supported her and being very weak after her Illness it was with a vast deal of Difficulty that she reach'd the Tower  The first Object that struck her Sight was the Scaffold and a Number of Guards which gave her room to believe that she was going to be a Victim to  Celima  's Jealousy  Inea  's Thoughts were the same which extremely terrify'd her  Felicia  's Sentiments were different from hers for tho' Death appear'd hard to her yet she had some sort of Satisfaction in seeing the approaching End of her Misfortunes Take Courage my dear  Inea  said she embracing her with a great deal of Tenderness the Danger only regards me and I look upon it with Indifferency it is a Remedy my Preservation commanded me not to seek but since it is my Fate I receive it with Pleasure I am going to die and shall no longer have a Sense of my Calamities No Lovely  Felicia  cry'd the Prince who was near enough to hear what she said you are not to die this Punishment is prepar'd for unfortune  Abelhamar  who now takes his last leave of you I protest it less concerns me to lose my Life in so shameful a manner than to want Assurances of your Favour Ah Madam added he with an Air full of Love and Grief can you refuse me a Look a Sigh  or a favourable Word You see I perish and my Misfortune proceeds from your transcendent Charms The Desire I had to see you reign made me endeavour to ascend the Throne from which my Father fell you inspir'd me with an Ambition I shou'd have manag'd better had I been less in Love You are the innocent Cause of the Disguise I am reproached with which is thought my Crime yet I have nothing to repent of since my Passion invites me to bear the Cruelty of my Fate But at least give me leave divine  Felicia  to believe that had my Design succeeded my Respect and Perseverance wou'd have made some Impression on you Only approve these Thoughts and I shall not think much to purchase so dear a Profession with the Loss of my Life  Felicia  at these Words was so disorder'd that she look'd some time at  Abelhamar  without having Power to speak She was touch'd with a sincere Compassion and deplor'd the Misfortune of this young Prince who was going to be sacrific'd so ignominiously She cou'd have wish'd the Queen's Resentment had fallen on her for the State of her Affairs with the Count of  La Vagne  was such as had render'd Life so insupportable to her that she seem'd very willing to resign it At last perceiving  Abelhamar  waited her Answer she said is this Scene prepar'd for you my Lord Alas why cannot I relieve you My Tears are the only Proofs I can give of my true Concern yet be assured I shall never be  so ungrateful as to forget your Favours This Day's Disaster will ever be before my Eyes Ah  Felicia  reply'd the Prince I thought your Compassion wou'd have inspired me with Courage but I find it has a contrary Influence Oh That I cou'd now live for you The Hopes you have given me make me extreamly regret leaving you since I must leave you for ever Here his Breast was oppress'd with so deep a Sorrow that he cou'd only express it by his repeated Sighs The Queen who was impatient to have the Prince executed had order'd that  Felicia  shou'd be call'd away from him when of a sudden she was alarm'd hearing at the Gates of the Palace the Shouts and Cries of People in Arms who were comanded by valiant  Mula  and had already charg'd the Soldiers of the Guard They demanded the Prince and threatned  Celima  with a general Revolt unanimously calling  Abelhamar  their King and saying they had cause to fear a Queen who was cruel enough to wash her Hands in the Blood of her nearest Relation and that if she deny'd their Request they wou'd deliver her up to the Punishment which she had design'd for the Prince  The Queen wou'd not have given much Attention to the Menaces of these seditious People had she not been inform'd that there were thick Clouds of Dust seen towards the Road of  Tunis  and that the Centinels who had already heard a confus'd Noise of warlike Instruments began to discover from the Walls  of the Town a Body of Men marching with great Precipitation soon after they came to acquaint her that there was a Herald at the Gate who desired Admittance to her Majesty in the Name of  Ismael  This News struck the Queen with Terror which she express'd by her Emotions being divided between Revenge and Despair Her Ministers press'd her to give Audience to the King of  Tituan  's Herald and after being a little compos'd she consented to see him he brought her a Letter which was in these Terms  I Am come to succour  Abelhamar  who is a Prince favour'd by Heaven and our great Prophet  Mahomet  therefore you must deliver him up to me Consider inhuman Queen that you have neither Arms nor Subjects to support you I am inform'd of every thing that passes in the Palace which I protest I will reduce to Ashes unless you immediately restore the Prince to his Liberty but if you send him to me or Hostages for his Security I will favour your Retreat you may leave the Kingdom and take with you such Attendance as you shall think necessary  Ismael Sultan  Celima  's Fortune cou'd hardly receive a greater Change she now saw at the Gates of her Capital an Enemy who treated her like a Conqueror that was just going to dethrone her The Soul of this imperious Princess grew so furious at  Ismael  's Menaces that instead of thinking of the Danger she was in her Mind  was only taken up with Revenge Come cry'd she Barbarian Come and be Witness of my Courage and Resentment the Man you intend to redeem shall be sacrific'd before your Eyes If Heaven and Earth shou'd joyn and the Elements return to their first Chaos What is it to me I have but a Life to lose which has been a Burthen to me these many Years let us go and strike off this rebellious Head which is so dear to  Ismael  and send it to him from the Height of the Tower Follow me said she to the Herald who waited her Answer come and see how I slight the Threats of your Master You shall Witness the Death of  Abelhamar  and receive his last Sighs Ending these Words she went hastily towards the Place where her Commands were only expected for his Execution but the Mufty the Admiral and Governour of the Town with several of her faithful Subjects flung themselves at her Feet Alass Madam said they consider the Misfortune which seems to point at you personally are you resolv'd to bury your self in the Ruins of the Palace That must certainly be your Fate if you irritate a King who is before your Walls with a potent Army this is no time Madam to revenge your self for in puting the Prince to Death it may raise a Mutiny and shou'd  Ismael  take Advantage of it you may lose your Life or become Captive to the Conqueror Is it not more glorious Madam to fly and seek in another Country some Forces who encourag'd  by your Presence may replace you on your Throne  The Queen's Women in Tears prostrated themselves at her Feet and said all that Zeal and Fear cou'd inspire at last her imperious Heart was touch'd rather at the Danger she expos'd so many Persons to who depended on her than at what concern'd her own Person Must the Queen of  Fez  submit cry'd she and seek her Safety in a shameful Flight which will cause her to blush the rest of her Days Oh Heavens Was ever Destiny so wretched as mine I shall become a Fugitive and banish'd my Kingdom be forc'd to beg Refuge of those whom I once cou'd have protected I cannot think I deserve so cruel a Fate Here she continued her Complaints and whilst she yielded to her excessive Grief  Abelhamar  was inform'd of the agreeable Change in his Fortune  He was entertaining  Felicia  when they came to tell him that  Ismael  's Ships and Forces were approaching Think with what Transports he receiv'd this News 'Tis now Madam said he to her that I can return the Goodness you just now express'd your Virtues have made a deep impression on me and since I am deliver'd from Death you shall no longer feel the Weight of your Chains I rejoice my Lord reply'd  Felicia  to see that the Danger is past and conjure you not to give your self any Uneasiness about me I am born to be unhappy and the Rigour of my Captivity is nothing when compar'd to my  inward Pain Farewel my Lord you have now Affairs of greater Importance to imploy your Thoughts Finishing these Words she retired and  Abelhamar  remain'd in the Tower by Order of the Queen who sent Hostages to  Ismael  with Assurances that the Prince shou'd be set at Liberty as soon as she had left the City  Unfortunate  Celima  was now preparing a Fleet and Transports to carry away her most valuable Goods She gave Instructions to those Persons whom she cou'd not take along with her and having dispos'd every Thing according to her Intention she made all imaginable Diligence to depart not depending on  Ismael  's Words and fearing the Consequences of  Abelhamar  's Resentment Thus the Fugitive Queen went off by Night with her Women and Slaves and was conducted to the Vessel which attended her She order'd immediately to set Sail with the rest of the Fleet and the Wind being fair they soon enter'd the  Mediterranean  Nothing cou'd be equal to the Concern  Celima  was in for the loss of her Kingdom she fetch'd deep Sighs and in spight of all her Pride cou'd not restrain her Tears Fortune Ungrateful Fortune said she your Capriciousness spares neither King nor Subject Who can flatter himself with being above your Reach You declar'd your self my Enemy from my Infancy and pursu'd me in the remotest Countries Once taken by a Pyrate I fell into the Power of  Bajazet  soon after you made use of  Cupid  's Arrows to pierce my  Heart Alas that Wound I never can hope to cure at last to shew your self more favourable you plac'd me on a Throne which you now force me to abandon What must I expect from you next Why don't you strike me at once with your most poison'd Darts that I may not be expos'd to new Torments Oh deplorable Fate shall I thus be for ever persecuted And you  Felicia  continued she casting her melancholy Eyes on  Leonida  who was near her you are the Author of my last Misfortune it is your fatal Beauty that has been the occasion of this Revolution Ah how can you evince me that you are innocent Alas Madam reply'd  Felicia  I had no Hand in the Prince's criminal Designs for if it be true that he had a Passion for me it was contrary to my Inclination I knew nothing of his Disguise nor did I ever flatter him with any Hopes On the contrary my Aversion was the only Return I made to his Addresses and from the first Hour he declar'd his Sentiments for me I resolv'd never to change I was inform'd said  Celima  that the Count of  La Vagne  who came to fetch away  Olympia  had given you much Uneasiness without doubt he is the Person you love but you are convinc'd he has no longer a Passion for you and since he has no Regard to your Affection you ought to disdain him These Words put  Felicia  into some Confusion who blushing cast down her Eyes without being able to utter one Word and her beauteous  Cheeks moisten'd with Tears sufficiently express'd the State of her anxious Soul You make me no Answer said  Celima  fetching a Sigh Ah I am better able to Answer for you I was willing to see whether your Tongue cou'd betray your Heart or disown a Distemper you cannot cure Alas  Felicia  I know too well by fatal Experience the irresistible Power of Love which unhappily surpriz'd me before I cou'd suppress its first Motions or even think how dangerous they might prove  If there are Torments in Love Madam said  Felicia  they ought not to affect a Sovereign whom Nature hath grac'd with such transcendent Perfections Nothing but Death or Absence can deprive you of the Object that is dear to you Inconstancy which surpasses either in Cruelty can never make you feel the tormenting Effects of it Ah  Felicia  reply'd  Celima  there is no Pain like that which is occasion'd by Absence since it keeps us in continual Fears both of Death and Infidelity At least Madam said  Felicia  there is one Comfort in it which is that having but an uncertain knowledge of the Truth we are generally inclin'd to believe what we most wish No continu'd  Celima  it is not as you imagine Uncertainty in Love is a Martyrdom which adds to all the Pains we can endure Alas Madam reply'd  Felicia  I shou'd now look on that uncertain State as a happy one since I might derive from it the pleasing Hopes which my present Condition entirely destroys  The Sovereign and her Charming Slave were entertaining each other with Discourses of this Quality and tho'  Celima  's Familiarity was very great yet  Felicia  was ever mindful of the Respect due to her Night was far advanc'd before they took any Rest but at last their Eyes yielded to what Nature required and  Celima  had been asleep some Hours when she was awak'd by the Noise of Seamen and Soldiers the former were preparing against a Storm which threaten'd 'em and the latter for an Engagement with  Abelhamar  whose Ships they had just discover'd  You must know that as soon as the Queen of  Fez  had set out for the Kingdom of  Granada  the Gates of  Sallee  and the Palace were open'd to the King of  Tituan  who immediately went to the Tower where the young Prince was Prisoner but the latter being already set at Liberty he came to meet the King with the greatest Marks of Joy and Gratitude for his happy Deliverance After  Abelhamar  had imploy'd some time in giving the King as obliging a Reception as that Juncture wou'd permit he cou'd not forbear going to the Apartment which belong'd to the Queen's Slaves thinking to find  Felicia  there for those who guarded him in his Confinement had not inform'd him of her being embark'd with  Celima  But you may imagine how great was his Surprize not to meet any Women there and to see every thing in Disorder This giving  him some Suspicion he proceeded to the Queen's Apartments which were open and quite empty so that he had no longer room to doubt of the loss of his  Felicia  He ran up and down like a distracted Man and express'd his excessive Grief in such Terms as extremely mov'd all that were with him Have I then lost you  Felicia  cry'd he my charming  Felicia  have I lost you at a time that I was flatter'd with the hopes of a perfect Felicity The Compassion you shew'd for me when I was expecting immediate Death was an Evincement of the Disposition you were in to do me Justice and had you not been compell'd to fly me I am inclin'd to believe you wou'd no longer refuse me your Affection But Oh my  Felicia  they have snatch'd you from me and my raging Passion is the only thing I have left in your cruel Absence Go  Mula  continu'd he go tell the King he has done nothing for me I am ready to give him up that Life which he has preserv'd and I conjure him to take it from me or restore me my Mistress but what do I say she is not in his Power then let him give me his Ships to pursue her  Mula  obey'd his Commands and went to  Ismael  whilst some Persons who remain'd with the Prince were giving him an Account with how much Precipitation the Queen went off and that she had set Sail for the Kingdom of  Granada Abelhamar  whose Impatience was great wou'd not wait  Mula  's Return but ran to  Ismael  who readily granted him all he desired  so having chosen some of the King's best Ships and swiftest Sailers he pursu'd  Celima  whose Fleet he knew was neither considerable in Strength or Number tho' he did not reflect that his Squadron was still Inferior Having put to Sea he stood on the QuarterDeck endeavouring to discover some of the Queen's Ships when he spy'd a Vessel not very distant He gave Orders they shou'd make all Sail which being executed and the Wind fair it was not long before he came up with her  The first Object that presented it self to him was the Count of  La Vagne  for his and  Olympia  's Sailing had been prevented by stormy Weather which forc'd 'em back so they chose to stay on Shipboard and remain in the Harbour where they waited a fair Opportunity of going on their Voyage As soon as  Abelhamar  perceiv'd it was the Count whether he look'd on him as a Rival who was the Occasion that his Passion for  Felicia  had not met with an obliging Return or that he consider'd him as an Enemy to that lovely Captive having behav'd himself towards her in an ungrateful and perfidious manner he cou'd not help conceiving so immoderate an Aversion for him that he instantly commanded  Mula  to take the Barge and go to the Count of  La Vagne  Tell him said the Prince that I look on him as a Traytor who deserves Death and if he has a Mind to save Those who are with him and have nothing to interpose in our Quarrel he may come to me or give me his Word of  Honour and I will go and decide the Affair with him  Mula  went on Board the Count of  La Vagne  's Ship and tho' he was not acquainted with  Abelhamar  whom he was sure had no reasonable Motive to quarrel with him yet he was so offended to see himself suspected being a Traytor that without entering into a Detail which might have made up the Difference he leap'd into  Mula  's Boat I will go said he to him with an Air full of Pride and Anger your Master shall see that such a Man as I is not to be insulted unreveng'd Thus without reflecting on the Danger to which he expos'd himself and even forgetting his dear Mistress he order'd them to Row him to  Abelhamar  's Ship  The Boat had already made some Way when  Olympia  's Woman awak'd her and gave her an Account of what was passing Her Surprize was so great that she just gave her self Time to take her NightGown then ran upon Deck from whence she perceiv'd her Lover at a great Distance Do you abandon me then my dear Count cry'd she and are you going to expose a Life which is mine What have you to say to cruel  Abelhamar  Oh don't leave me so but come back to your dear  Olympia  or take me along with you that I may undergo the same Fate Whilst she was uttering these Words the Count had reach'd  Abelhamar  's Ship  Olympia  seeing this desir'd the Captain of that she was in to let her take his Barge which being granted  she bad them pull up with all Speed towards the Prince's Ship but she unfortunately arriv'd there too late The Count was already engag'd with  Abelhamar  and tho' he fought with all the Courage and Dexterity imaginable he was forc'd at length to yield having received a mortal Wound  As he was making his last Efforts to defend himself against  Abelhamar  's reiterated Blows the unhappy  Olympia  came up and perceiving at a small Distance that her Lover was cover'd with Blood and hardly able to support himself she cry'd out in a loud Voice hold barbarous Prince hold What have I done to you that shou'd provoke you to deprive me of my Life Don't you know that the Count of  La Vagne  is to be mine Give some Intermission to your Rage cruel as you are or if nothing but a Sacrifice will satisfy you I am here ready to receive the Blow Come and pierce my Heart but spare oh spare the Man I love  The Accent of a Voice so dear to the Count reach'd him just as he fell at  Abelhamar  's Feet He strove to raise his Head and turning his Eyes towards  Olympia  's Barge he saw his Divine Mistress despairing who with much ado got on Board the Ship and was no sooner there but fell in a Swoon near the Count and remain'd Speechless a long while After she was a little recover'd all she cou'd do was to lay her dying Lover's Head on her Knees and bath his Wounds with her Tears Thus oppress'd with mortal Grief she sate down without being able to complain  The Count endeavour'd to speak to her and taking her by the Hand said I die my dear  Olympia  I die entirely yours and regret departing from Life only for your sake With these Words his Soul took its Flight and left his Body in the Arms of his deplorable Mistress who said such moving things and acted so much Despair that even  Abelhamar  was inconsolable for being the Author of her Affliction He sent her half dead on Board the Ship she was in before and order'd the Count of  La Vagne  's Corps to be also transported  Olympia  instead of going to  Genoa  sail'd for  Sardinia  in order to retire to her Aunt's Monastry where having erected a magnificent Tomb for her Lover she continu'd the rest of her Days lamenting the irreparable Loss she had made Thus we are often deceiv'd when in the greatest hopes of an approaching Happiness which Fortune changes into the cruelest Torments  Abelhamar  wou'd not have left  Olympia  in this desolate Condition had not his Passion invited him elsewhere He impatiently desir'd to overtake the Queen being resolv'd to force his  Felicia  from her and he was not long in his Pursuit before they came to tell him that they had discover'd  Celima  's Ships One may judge how extremely overjoy'd he was at this News He immediately gave Orders to make all Sail then imploying his Wishes for Success and a fair Wind prepar'd himself for an Engagement with the Queen's Squadron who were also doing the same  This unfortunate Princess knowing the Danger which threaten'd her encourag'd her People and having sent to all the Captains to come on Board her Ship she call'd a Council then Orders were given and each Officer thought of nothing but doing his Duty The Trumpets began to sound and the Cannons roar'd whilst on each side they were endeavouring to gain the Advantage of the Wind with a Resolution not to shew any Favour Thus ready for a Fight  Celima  said to her Soldiers Observe that dangerous Serpent pointing at  Abelhamar  who was in Armour walking on his QuarterDeck see that ungrateful Man whom I brought up with so much Care he is now meditating my Ruin did I not spare his Life tho' it ever endanger'd mine yet he is not satisfy'd with my quitting my Kingdom to expose myself on this dangerous Element He even pursues me and so greedily thirsts after Blood that nothing can please him but my Death Help me ye brave and Loyal Subjects to punish this Rebel and let us by destroying him afford an Example for other Traytors in Ages to come  The Queen was thus animating her Soldiers whilst  Felicia  and  Inea  were indulging their Melancholy See my Dear said  Felicia  see these dreadful Preparations what can be the fatal Consequence of this Engagement I fear we shall once more be the Victims of Fortune Oh Heaven cry'd she rather let me die than fall into the Hands of  Abelhamar  since no greater Disaster can ever happen to me  Inea  endeavour'd to comfort and give her hopes saying why do you thus afflict your self since nothing is yet decided We are all preparing for a vigorous Resistance and the Weather begins to be so Stormy that one wou'd almost believe it impossible for the two Fleets to approach She was still speaking when on a sudden there arose such a boisterous Wind with Thunder and Lightning that on each side instead of continuing their Preparation for a Fight they were forc'd to employ all Hands to save themselves from greater Dangers  Thus the Fleets were dispers'd without knowing which way to steer their Course The raging Wind rent the Sails and split the Masts and the artless Pilot with Death in his Looks was torn from his Helm The impetuous Waves toss'd the Ships here and there till at last unable to withstand their resistless Fury some were dash'd against the Rocks others wreck'd on the Shoar and few escap'd this terrible Tempest  Abelhamar  having lost Sight of the Ship wherein he thought  Felicia  and despairing of ever seeing her more look'd on the Danger he was in with some kind of Satisfaction No said he to  Mula  who made unsuccesful Efforts to console his Master no shou'd I escape Death which now threatens me you must not think that I can ever enjoy any Pleasure or Happiness without the Possession of  Felicia  My Passion for her increases more and more  by the many Difficulties I meet with and tho' I see the fatal Powers which oppose me yet nothing shall make me change the Design I have of pursuing her  By this time the Weather grew more Calm and Day being far advanc'd the Prince was consulting  Mula  which way he shou'd steer his Course to find his Mistress He had already pass'd the Streights of  Gibraltar  in order to go to  Carthagena  or  Porto Real  not doubting but the Queen had reach'd one of those Harbours to shelter herself from the Storm he therefore resolv'd for the Coast of  Andalusia  but they who accompany'd him disapprov'd his Design Consider my Lord said they that this is the only Ship left of several which  Ismael  lent you and that your pursuing  Celima  may prove of a fatal Consequence Her Sex her Beauty and Misfortunes will plead for her and what will the King of  Granada  think to see you come into his Dominions in Pursuit of an unhappy Princess who has abandon'd her's and left you Master of them He may detain you as an Hostage till he has made advantageous Conditions in her favour with the King of  Tituan  and it is not to be expected that this Monarch will continue your Friend whilst you act contrary to his Interest for shou'd his generous Disposition happen to change he might take Possession himself of what he has just acquir'd for you Let us return to  Sallee  my Lord continu'd they if the Kingdom of  Fez  remains in your Hands you may soon be in a Condition to ask what you please of the King of  Granada  who will deliver up  Felicia  to you rather than have any difference with you about a Christian Slave  Abelhamar  was mortally displeas'd to see that the present Conjuncture oblig'd him to return to  Fez  and what added to his Affliction in his way thither was to meet on every side the dismal Fragments of Shipwracks which cover'd the Surface of the Sea and made him but too sensible that he had lost the greatest part of his Fleet  The Queen on her side had not been expos'd to lesser Dangers for all her Fleet was dispers'd and as the Wind drove her into the Port of  Carthagena  the stern of her Ship struck so fiercely against another that they both had like to have sunk which Accident shatter'd what the Storm had spar'd but several Boats and Barges came immediately to the Queen's Assistance and landed her safe with her Women and Equipage  She had hardly step'd out of her Barge but was inform'd of the great Alterations which had happen'd in the Kingdom of  Granada  by the Death of  Mahomet  who being poison'd by the means of a Gown which was sent to him as a Present had left the Crown to his Brother  Joseph  whom he had detain'd Prisoner many Years in the Castle of  Salobrena Celima  sent an Officer of her Guards to congratulate this Prince on his happy and unexpected  Accession to the Throne desiring him at the same time to take Compassion on her She sent also to some of her near Relations who held the lighest Rank in that Court  The Governour of  Carthagena  hearing that the Queen of  Fez  was landed went to meet her with all the Marks of Honour and Respect that were due to her Quality She had an Apartment prepar'd for her in the Castle where she remain'd two Days to repose her self after the Danger and Fatigue she had undergone and from thence set out for  Granada  where they were already inform'd of her Landing and were prepar'd to receive her being willing to give a Sanctuary to that unfortunate Queen  Joseph  King of  Granada  immediately order'd his two Sons  Mahomet  and  Osmin  to go and meet  Celima  with Assurances of his Concern for her Misfortunes and how desirous he was to serve her in all that lay in his Power These Princes were perfectly accomplish'd and as the Prince of  Carency  had been confin'd by the late King's Orders in the Castle of  Salobrena  whilst they were Prisoners there they had conceiv'd so entire a Friendship for him that they resolv'd to set him at Liberty if ever their Condition shou'd change but the King their Father being desirous to make Peace with the  Spaniards  and knowing that the Infanta Don  Fernand  had offer'd  Mahomet  a considerable Ranson for the Count of  La Vagne  for he continu'd calling himself by that Title  thought that in detaining him it might be a more effectual means to obtain what he so earnestly wish'd Nevertheless as he had a particular Esteem for the Prince he ask'd him if he wou'd give him his Honour not to go away without his Consent which the other having readily promis'd the King took him along with him to  Granada  The Day he made his Entry he sent the Prince of  Carency  a magnificent Dress with a rich Turbant and a Scymiter embellish'd with Jewels which shew'd it was the King's pleasure he shou'd dress himself after the  Moorish  manner in order to accompany him to all the Solemnities of his Coronation  But the King who had found in the Prince a great Resemblance of the brave  Assimir  who was a Grandee of the House of  Abanserages  much consider'd in that Kingdom and had been lately kill'd us'd often to give the Prince that Name out of a Mark of Favour who equally receiv'd it as such and as he was unwilling to be known he chose rather to be called by that Name than any other  Tho' time had not been able to diminish the Prince's Passion or alleviate his Grief yet in spite of his excessive Melancholy every Body distinguish'd him as one of the finest Gentlemen that was ever known Amongst all those who shew'd him the greatest marks of Esteem the Princes  Mahomet  and  Osmin  particularly express'd themselves his Friends  Mahomet  had eminent Qualities but was so presumptuous  that he wou'd have sacrific'd any thing to gratify his Desires His younger Brother  Osmin  was as fine a Prince and had nobler Inclinations which made the King have a greater Affection for him than for the rest of his Children  As soon as News was brought of  Celima  's being near  Granada  these two Princes by the King their Father's Order at the Head of the Noblemen of that Court went out of Town to meet the Queen The Prince of  Carency  was one of those who accompany'd them in this Cavalcade and each Cavalier had a Motto painted on his Shield The Prince caus'd an  Apollo  pursuing  Daphne  to be drawn on his with these Words round it written in  Spanish Quiero y busco quien me aborece y me fuyo  that is I love and pursue one who hates and flies me This Thought express'd in a gallant Manner his disappointed Passion The Princes understood it immediately for whilst they were in Confinement together he told 'em part of his Adventures and made a Secret only of his and his Mistress's true Name which he conceal'd for several political Reasons especially on his Brother and  Don John  of  Velasco  's Account who had both fought against the  Moors  and defeated them in several Engagements  So many Historians have inform'd the World how highly the  Moors  in those Days distinguish'd themselves above other Nations by their Gallantry and Magnificence that I shall decline extending that Subject and only say  that the unfortunate but beauteous Queen of  Fez  elected that Court for her Refuge where she appear'd with such Attractives as inspir'd Love in all who beheld her  Mahomet  and his Brother accompany'd by the Prince of  Carency  in his  Moorish  Dress which admirably became him met the Queen at a small distance from  Granada  She sate alone in a fine open Chariot and all her Women follow'd her in Chaises  Felicia  and  Inea  were together in one and had drawn the Curtains to have an Opportunity of entertaining each other more conveniently Ought we to look on our being near  Spain  said  Felicia  to her Friend as a favourable Change towards our better Fortune I think reply'd  Inea  that the Circumstances can no ways prove to our Disadvantage Alas as for my part interrupted  Felicia  I have so little hopes of Happiness in this Life that I cou'd now leave the World with Pleasure  Inea  did not omit any thing which cou'd divert her from these melancholy Reflections tho' she herself had cause enough to be uneasy not having heard from her dear  Don Ramire  Whilst they were talking the Princes alighted and saluted the Queen with many Assurances in the Name of the King their Father then took Horse again and rode by the side of her Chariot entertaining her Majesty with what was most suitable to the Occasion of her Voyage But  Celima  became of a sudden so pensive that she cou'd hardly make 'em any Answer her Eyes were entirely  fix'd on the Prince of  Carency  and she had not Power to turn them on any other Object Her Joy and Surprize were equally extraordinary and what added to both was seeing him in a  Moorish  Dress which gave her a Curiosity to ask his Name of one of the Guards that was near her who not knowing that the Prince was a Prisoner of War but had only seen him with the King in his Journey from  Salobrena  to  Granada  told the Queen he was call'd  Assimir  She immediately conjectur'd he had some important Reasons which oblig'd him to assume that Name and Disguise so did not ask any other Questions relating to him yet what gave her some Uneasiness was to find that he did not take any particular Notice of her She was a good while in Expectation he wou'd have spoken to her at last seeing he continu'd Silent she address'd her Discourse to him and for a pretence ask'd him the Signification of the Motto which she had perceiv'd on his Shield He told her the Meaning and added that he was the unhappiest Man in the World The Queen imagin'd that by the  Apollo  he meant himself and  Daphne  to be her which fill'd her Mind with such Ideas as were too pleasing to be express'd I have sometimes had a Prophetick Spirit said she to him smiling and have foretold things without knowing their true Cause Methinks I have a great Disposition to do you the same Favour  Assimir  Your  Daphne  neither flies  nor hates you and you shall soon have the Satisfaction of seeing her Ah Madam cry'd the Prince transported what do you tell me Is it possible that the cruel fair One who is the Object of my Sufferings will at last vouchsafe to make me happy Yes reply'd  Celima  with a gracious Air she is as willing as you to put a period to your Torments and I promise you that as soon as I am a little at Leisure I will tell you more of the matter Alas Madam reply'd he I do not deserve that so great a Queen shou'd be concern'd in my Fortune which hitherto has prov'd very fatal and I dare hardly hope a better one for the future  Celima  said no more to him at that time fearing the particular Distinction she had shewn him might be taken Notice of which undoubtedly wou'd have disoblig'd  Mahomet  who had already found so many Charms in the Queen that he cou'd not sufficiently deplore her Misfortunes and whilst he was thus offering her his Pity a more powerful Passion made way to his Heart  The nearer  Celima  approach'd  Granada  the more she admired the Beauty of that famous City which is situated in a Plain at the Extremity whereof is a snowy Hill from whence spring two Rivers the  Daro  and  Genil  the one often produces GoldDust mix'd with the Sand and the other pure Silver The Air of that Climate is sweet and refin'd and there seldom appears any Winter the Spring and Autumn united afford Flowers and Fruit  without being at the trouble of cultivating the Earth There are whole Forests of Orange Mirtle and Pomgranate Trees and as Nature had taken Care to embellish the Country so no Art had been spar'd to beautify the City which was incompass'd with a strong Wall and Twelve Hundred Towers The Palace of  Alhambro  which the Kings had chosen for their Court was so magnificent that nothing but the Castle of  Abbaycin  cou'd be equal to it which on every side shin'd with Gold and Azure supported by Marble and Porphyry besides the  Moors  observ'd an admirable Order in Architecture which highly recommended their Buildings and as for their Gardens Walks and Fountains they were so wonderfully well contriv'd that nothing cou'd be added to their Beauty and Agreeableness  The Queen arriv'd at the Gates of the Town where the People assembled in great Multitudes But the Prince of  Carency  to avoid the Crowd took another way which insensibly led him to the side of the River  Daro  whence he continued till he came to a Fountain whose Water was as clear as Crystal the deep Silence which reign'd in that Place and the Inclination he had to meditate on what the Queen of  Fez  had said to him invited him to alight he ty'd his Horse to a Tree and lay down on the Grass then calling to mind what  Celima  had told him by what Chance thought he did this Princess who never saw me before single me out to acquaint me that  Leonida  still loves me and that I shall soon see her Has any one inform'd her of my Sentiments Methinks it does not well become one of her Rank to rally an unfortunate Man who cannot even flatter himself with Hopes much less with the real Enjoyment of so unexpected a Blessing  He was drown'd in Reflections of this Nature when the Voice of a Man who spoke the  Arabick  Tongue interrupted him asking whether the Queen of  Fez  was yet arriv'd at  Granada  The Prince knew very well that the Person who was coming up to him was a Stranger and that he only spoke  Arabick  to him because of his Dress supposing him to be some Grandee in Alliance with the  Moors  He fix'd his Eyes on this Foreigner but Heavens how great was their surprize when they knew each other  Benavidez  for it was he cou'd not help turning pale at the thoughts of his Perfidiousness and the Prince swelling with Anger said to him From whence come you unworthy Wretch that you are What  Doemon  has convey'd you here to receive the Punishment of of your Treacheries Finishing these Words he drew his Sword and us'd it with such Fierceness that the  Spaniard  notwithstanding his Bravery was daunted and seiz'd with Terrour till at last calling Despair to his Succour and seeing the inevitable Danger he was in he fought rather like a desperate Man than one who had a mind to save his Life The Prince resolving not to spare him reiterated his Blows  with such Vigour that he soon gave  Benavidez  a mortal Wound which made him fall at his Feet Ah my Lord said he to the Prince with a feeble and incoherent Accent it is but just I shou'd die by your Hand after all the Injuries I have done you Did I deserve such Usage Traitor reply'd the Prince Since you can deceive me no longer where have you left perfidious  Leonida  Now is the time to convince me that you are yet capable of repenting a base Action I am willing to obey you answer'd  Benavidez  stretching out his Hand upon Condition that you will forgive me Speak and I will even forget all said the Prince tell me what is become of my  Leonida  I declare to you reply'd  Benavidez  whose Face shew'd the Symptoms of an approaching Death that  Leonida  never ceas'd loving you she no ways consented to her Flight but almost consum'd with Grief loaded me with the cruellest Reproaches and her utmost Aversion was the only return she made my Passion yet in spite of her Tears and Resistance I took her with me on Board a Ship and was promising myself a happy Voyage when we were met by some of the Enemy's Ships who engag'd and took ours I was so dangerously wounded thatFarewel my Lord I can say no more I am dying His Eyes instantly clos'd and his Soul made its Exit whilst he was lying in the Prince's Arms  Benavidez  's Death touch'd the Prince of  Carency  's generous Soul who forgetting all his  Ingratitude began to pity him saying that he wou'd never have been guilty of the Crimes he had committed cou'd he have defended his Heart from  Leonida  's Charms and looking on him as an unhappy Rival and a reconciled Enemy his Compassion took Place of his Resentment He reflected on what  Benavidez  had just told him relating to his dear  Leonida  but he was perfectly inconsolable not knowing the Enemies who had taken her Fatal Death cry'd he thou hast snatch'd away the Life of a Man who was going to inform me of a Circumstance which is of the greatest Importance to me Where must I fly to seek the Object of my Love and how can I tell into whose Hands she is fallen Oh Heavens am I not more unfortunate than ever The Thoughts of her being inconstant gave some Intermission to my Passion for which I was endeavouring to find a Cure but now the Case is chang'd I am concern'd for a Mistress to whom I am contracted she has ever been true to me and perhaps has found a Lover and a Master in the Man who has her now in his Possession Oh unparallel'd Fatality How tormenting will these Apprehensions be to my afflicted Soul Which way shall I go to find her The Prince was so deeply involv'd in these anxious Reflections that he did not immediately perceive a Wound he had receiv'd in his Arm but finding himself grow weak by the great Loss of Blood he thought fit to retire  Just as he enter'd the Town he met  Zulema  who was a  Moor  of the Family of  Abenserages  to whose Guard he had been committed by Orders of the late King whilst he was Prisoner in the Castle of  Salobrena  The Prince having a Confidence in this  Moor  thought he cou'd not chuse any one more capable of ordering  Benavidez  's Burial therefore he desired  Zulema  to oblige him in this Occasion who without delay tho' the Night was far spent took some Slaves with him and went to the Fountain in order to execute the Prince's Commands  As he came near the Place he heard a Person lamenting grievously which at first surpriz'd him not distinguishing what he said but having alighted from his Horse he perceiv'd a Man who was embracing  Beavidez  's Body and bemoaning his Misfortune in the  Spanish  Tongue Ah my dear  Benavidez  said he how unlucky it is that I was not here to defend you against the Traitors who have murder'd you Alas my Uneasiness and Fears had already foretold your Death Here  Zulema  interrupted this Stranger and being compassionate told him  Benavidez  had not been kill'd by any treacherous means and that he who fought him was so generous an Enemy that he had even desir'd him to come and see the Corps interr'd The  Spaniard  who was very young express'd his Concern by his Tears and said Oh Sir Nothing can alleviate my Affliction since I have lost all in losing my dear Master  Zulema  endeavour'd  to comfort him then order'd his People to take the Corps and bury it in a little Wood not far from the Fountain  This being perform'd  Zulema  who was naturally generous and then mov'd with Pity at the repeated Complaints of this Servant of  Benavidez  ask'd him if he wou'd go along with him to  Granada  You shall be safe in my House said he which is a Favour your Countrymen cannot well expect in this Kingdom Don  Sanche  for that was the  Spaniard  's Name hesitated some time before he made an Answer but at last whether Fear or Prudence prevail'd with him he told  Zulema  that since he was pleas'd to offer him his House for a Sanctuary he was very willing to wait on him  Zulema  who was uneasy about the Prince's Wound went directly to see him and the mean while sent the  Spaniard  to his House to wait his return  The Prince was in Bed and the Surgeon who had dress'd his Wound found it somewhat dangerous which soon occasion'd a Report in the Town that he had had a Rencounter tho' the Particulars were not known and when  Zulema  enter'd the Prince's Chamber he found the King's two Sons sitting by him who were much concern'd at this Accident  Mahomet  thus continued the Discourse he had already begun I must tell you it is unkind to make a Mystery to us of your Enemy's Name I owe you my Lord reply'd the Prince too much Gratitude and Affection ever to do that  which might deserve a Reproach from you I shou'd be very willing to tell you who was my Enemy if there were Cause to apprehend any farther Consequences but I am entirely easy on that Score besides I am oblig'd to keep a Secret which I was sworn to before I thought you wou'd have ask'd me the Detail of this Affair so beg leave to be silent  Osmin  fearing this Conversation might create some Uneasiness in the Prince obligingly wav'd the Discourse and said to him You have lost very much by not attending the Queen of  Fez  for laying aside the honourable Reception the King my Father gave her and the extraordinary Lustre which the Ladies of our Court appear'd in she commanded all her Slaves to pull off their Veils and I must confess we were both astonish'd and charm'd to see so many beautiful Creatures Their Praise was the chief Entertainment of the Court and I am persuaded they will cause many a Lover to be guilty of Infidelity That is already your Case Brother reply'd  Mahomet  smiling and you cannot deny but the Eyes of that  Felicia  whose Name you were so desirous to know have made such an Impression as may endanger your Liberty I own to you said  Osmin  that I prefer her to all the rest her Beauty is not to be parallel'd and I am surpriz'd Brother that you escap'd falling her Captive No answer'd  Mahomet  my Heart is not so easily wounded  Alas my Lord interrupted the Prince of  Carency  perhaps your Time is not come but you will find your self as sensible as any of us when you meet with the Object whom Destiny has decreed to inspire you As for my part I dread that fatal Moment as much as a Pilot does a Rock in a Storm Why don't you bestow your Inclinations on a Slave like  Felicia  reply'd  Osmin  At least you wou'd be free from any cruel Torments Who can tell my Lord said the Prince whether that Slave will like the Man who has a Passion for her Love is capricious and ever guided by Fancy therefore a Slave may look with Indifference on the greatest Monarch in the World How can you thus oppose my Satisfaction with your Reflections cry'd  Osmin  Wou'd you have me cease loving  Felicia  out of groundless Apprehensions Indeed Brother reply'd  Mahomet  it's strange you shou'd say you love a Person whom you hardly know Nay you may stile it as you please said  Osmin  but what I can affirm is that the Perfections of this young Captive have already engag'd me Nothing in Nature can be more beautiful no nor even comparable to this lovely Creature and I impatiently wish  Assimir  's Recovery that he may be able to make his court to the Queen of  Fez  he will then be judge of what I advance  It will not be so easy to see her as you imagine my Lord interrupted  Zulema  who had been silent all this while I have been at  Salee  where I stay'd a considerable Time and the Negotiations I was imploy'd in by the late King gave me frequent Opportunities of having both private and publick Audiences with the Queen yet whenever I was admitted I found her surrounded with the oldest and ugliest Women in the World She us'd to set a strict Watch on all her pretty Slaves and keep 'em so conceal'd that unless her Humour be much alter'd I am sure you will find some Difficulty in paying your Courtship to  Felicia  That Sex is very unjust cry'd  Osmin  I suppose  Celima  will not let her Slaves be seen for fear they shou'd eclipse her Charms 'Tis you that are unjust reply'd  Mahomet  why shou'd you attribute to any other Cause a Custom which has been long establish'd only for the safety of Slaves Every one must agree that  Celima  is endow'd with too many Excellencies to apprehend any thing from other Beauties Ha Brother said  Osmin  you were boasting a while ago of your Insensibility but I find by the passionate Air with which you express yourself in the Queen's Defence that you are not so very indifferent as you wou'd make us believe  Mahomet  who had no mind to satisfy his Brother on that Subject made no Reply but rising up address'd himself to  Assimir  meaning the Prince of  Carency  whom he embrac'd and after having desir'd him to take Care of his Health he and his Brother took their leave of him  Zulema  retir'd at the same time without acquainting him that  he had met  Benavidez  's Servant The Prince on the other Hand was impatient to entertain him but there was no possibility of doing it till the next Day  One may imagine the Prince pass'd but a very ill Night What the Queen and  Benavidez  had said to him strangely perplex'd his Mind which being added to the Pain he suffer'd by his Wound threw him before Morning into a violent Feaver  Zulema  who had a particular Concern for the Prince rose early and went to enquire after his Health they told him he had not repos'd all Night and if he pleas'd might go into his Chamber As soon as the Prince perceiv'd him Ah my dear  Zulema  said he I was wishing to see you All that pass'd Yesterday has put me into such a disorder as I shall not be able to overcome without your Assistance The Queen of  Fez  spoke to me as if she knew me and I remark'd in her Air and Eyes something more obliging than is usually express'd for a Person one has never seen besides she assures me that my Mistress neither flies nor hates me and that I shall have the pleasure of seeing her soon Who cou'd have inform'd her of a thing so positive I shou'd be inclin'd to think that Chance was the only Cause why she entertain'd me so agreeably were it not for the Rencounter I had Yesterday near the Fountain He whom I fought was my Rival the same  Benavidez  who carry'd off my  Felicia  He told me with his last Breath she had ever lov'd me  and that her Sentiments for me were still the same it is not probable he wou'd have utter'd an untruth in so dismal a Condition But just as he was going to tell me where he had left her he was depriv'd both of his Speech and Life You cannot imagine how this grieves my Soul  Felicia  loves me can any Happiness be greater Yet Alas I have lost her and know not where to enquire after her What Misfortune can be equal to mine Here he was some time silent  Zulema  told him that a more favourable Fortune wou'd certainly disclose a Secret on which depended his Felicity and that he did not doubt but he might receive some Information from a young Man he found weeping near  Benavidez  's Body whom he had detain'd at his House for that purpose Oh I conjure you send for him immediately cry'd the Prince I remember his Master in approaching me ask'd whether the Queen of  Fez  was yet arriv'd at  Granada  perhaps she knew him and that in relating his Adventures to her he mention'd something concerning mine I ought not to neglect any means in my present Circumstances for if that young Man was with  Benavidez  when he ran away with my Mistress and can tell me what is become of her I shall be bless'd above Mankind  I perceive so great an Emotion in you my Lord reply'd  Zulema  that I am sorry for having acquainted you with a Particular which may be prejudicial to your Health No said  the Prince do not fear any thing but if you have either Love or Pity relieve me in this urgent Occasion Shall I tell you then what I was thinking answer'd  Zulema Osmin  spoke to you Yesterday very much in Praise of one  Felicia  who is a Slave of  Celima  's it is probable she may be the Person you love I began to suspect the same interrupted the Prince but was not willing to harbour such a Thought for there are many  Felicias  in  Spain  and after the Adventure I had at  Jaen  with Don  Alonso  by a Mistake which that Name occasion'd I have room to fear the like Disappointment I only beg you will send for the young Man you spoke of  Zulema  commanded one of his Slaves in whom he confided to give a  Moorish  Dress to the  Spaniard  and bring him immediately along with him This was the Precaution he us'd to prevent his being taken at  Granada  for a Sranger Don  Sanche  was a little unwilling at first to go out of  Zulema  's House not knowing where they intended to carry him but the Slave having told him they were going to an intimate Friend of his Master's whose Name was  Assimir  he readily follow'd him believing  Assimir  was a  Moor  and he continued in the same Opinion even when he enter'd the Prince of  Carency  's Chamber who was in Bed and the Windows clos'd Come nearer Don  Sanche  said  Zulema  to him and tell us sincerely what you know concerning  Felicia  of  Leon  This unexpected Question surpriz'd the  Spaniard  who was some time without making any Answer What said the Prince do you hesitate Tell me immediately what is become of her Were you not with your Master when he carry'd her away Heavens What new Astonishment did this Voice create Don  Sanche  or to explain myself in a clearer manner  Casilda  Sister to  Benavidez  for it was she who was thus disguis'd was suddenly struck with such a violent Trembling that had not the Chamber been very dark it wou'd have been impossible to conceal her Disorder Her Eyes were endeavouring to see the Person whom her Heart already knew whilst the Prince on his side was in the utmost Impatience to be inform'd of his Mistress's Fate What said she to her self shall my Rival for ever be ador'd and cou'd her Absence no ways extinguish the Prince's Passion Was ever Misfortune equal to mine Then resolving at once not to mention any thing which might discover  Leonida  's being with the Queen of  Fez  'tis true my Lord said she I was with Don  Fernand Benavidez  when he ran away with the fair Lady you nam'd and we shou'd have had a prosperous Voyage were it not for the fatal Rencounter of two  Turkish  Ships who engag'd ours and took it my Master being the only Man that resisted with undaunted Courage The Captains of these Ships were so charm'd with  Felicia  's Beauty which had receiv'd no Injury from her Affliction that they resolv'd to carry  her to  Constantinople  in order to present her to the Grand Seignior therefore having given her a very Rich Dress they brought her to that Emperour who was so mightily taken with her that he immediately plac'd her in his  Seraglio  As for my Master and I good Fortune wou'd have it that we were sold to the  Bashaw  of  Morea  who knew Don  Fernand Benavidez  to whom he was indebted for some considerable Service he had render'd him in  Spain  This  Bashaw  was a famous Renegado which was his only Crime for he was very generous and so grateful that he restor'd us to our Liberty without requiring any Ransom Thus we return'd to  Andalusia  where we were just landed when my Master heard that the Queen of  Fez  was coming to  Granada  which determin'd him to come hither in order to pay his Court to her  The Prince during  Casilda  's Relation was seiz'd with an unspeakable Affliction when he heard that  Felicia  was among the Grand Seignior's Women The Anxiety of such a cruel Thought overpower'd his Senses and his Wound opening so great a quantity of Blood gush'd out that it flung him into a Swoon  Zulema  surpriz'd at the Prince's Silence spoke to him but as he made no Reply he took his Hand which was in a cold Sweat this startled him and calling for a Light he saw the Picture of Despair painted on the Face of this unfortunate Prince who was without Motion and his Paleness wou'd have persuaded  one that his Soul had already left his Body But how shall I represent here the deplorable Condition of  Casilda  whose Passion was rais'd to such a Transcendency that having no Regard to her Honour she fram'd a false Story to destroy the Prince's Hopes of ever seeing his divine Mistress at another time she wou'd have sacrific'd a Thousand Lives to have sav'd his but at this Juncture had he died one might have accus'd her with being the Cause of his Death  Had not  Zulema  's Concern been so great he wou'd have easily discover'd that of the Counterfeit Don  Sanche  who without Restraint shed a Deluge of Tears and express'd a more than ordinary Care in assisting the Prince who at last receiving a little Strength from the Cordials they gave him open'd his weak Eyes which he fix'd languishingly on his Friend and Don  Sanche  whose Face he thought he knew yet did not take much Notice of him then turning to  Zulema  Ah pity me cry'd he since my Misfortunes can never be greater they are come to their last period I had lost my  Felicia  and thought her false which in some Measure suppress'd my tormenting Passion but now I am informed she is Living and that her Affection for me is still the same Had that Tyrant Death shatch'd her from me I shou'd doubtless have been inconsolable for her Loss yet methinks I shou'd be free from those tumultuous Fears which now rack my Mind Oh What dismal  Objects appear to my distracted Imagination  Felicia  in the  Seraglio  and belov'd by the Grand Seignior Heavens What greater Cruelty can ever be inflicted on a Man so passionately in Love I have lost her and shall never see her more I am even jealous and I fear her Heart will at last yield to the barbarous Laws which ill Fortune has impos'd on her Here his disturb'd Thoughts interrupted his Discourse whilst  Zulema  was using all his Endeavours to mitigate so violent a Grief  Felicia  had too sincere a Passion for you said he ever to change in favour of a Prince who is no ways agreeable and is too proud to give himself the least Trouble towards obtaining the Favours of a Lady he thinks all must submit to his Authority and I am persuaded that as she will neither relish his Addresses nor make any Return her Resistance and Coldness will soon render her indifferent to the Emperour Suppose I were free from these Apprehensions interrupted the Prince by what means shall I hear from her Is she not in the Grand Seignior's  Seraglio  and absolutely lost for me Oh 'tis too true I cannot flatter myself no not even wish to see her more which Misfortune compleats my Despair  Casilda  was in no small Confusion when she heard him speak in such passionate Terms She was several times tempted to make herself known that she might address herself to him in the tenderest Expressions Love cou'd inspire but calling to mind what pass'd between 'em  when she acquainted him with  Leonida  's Flight it made her apprehend that if she spoke to him at this Juncture it wou'd be as ill timed therefore thought proper to wait another Opportunity in the mean time she affected an extraordinary Concern for the Prince who remark'd it and was not slow in shewing his Acknowledgments for he told her thinking he was speaking to a Man that altho' his present Fortune being then a Prisoner did not permit him to bestow great Favours on those who were in his Service yet if he was willing to stay with him till he cou'd be better provided for he wou'd take Care of him  Assimir  little knew the Effect this Proposal created in our disguis'd Lady who immediately accepted it with all imaginable Marks of Joy and Respect assuring him that no Body wou'd serve him with more Zeal and Fidelity but before we see how strict she was to her Promise let us be inform'd by what Chance she came to  Granada  Abelhamar  and the Admiral of  Fez  having taken the Ship  Leonida  was in it was thought  Benavidez  cou'd not recover of the Wounds he had receiv'd in his vigorous Resistance so was left for Dead but after  Leonida  had been conducted on Board the Admiral they found in  Benavidez  some Symptoms of Life which made 'em take care of him till they were landed at  Sallee  where he continued a long time extremely ill  Leonida  knew nothing of it being strictly guarded in the Palace but as soon as he was recover'd he resolv'd either  pay her Ransom or carry her off by Stratagem With this Design he wrote to  Casilda  who having receiv'd his Letter lost no time in preparing for that Voyage and as her Passion for the Prince of  Carency  had met with no Return but Disdain she was meditating on some desperate Enterprize in order to act a Vengeance proportionable to the Injury she thought this might be a favourable Opportunity therefore taking her Jewels with a considerable Sum of Money she disguis'd herself in Man's Apparel to prevent her being known and embark'd for  Sallee  where she arriv'd soon after with the Resolution of taking away  Leonida  's Life and to succeed in her wicked Design she had brought with her a Box of the subtilest Poison  Benavidez  was not a little overjoy'd at  Casilda  's Arrival and after he had paid his Ransom to the Admiral he only thought of recovering  Leonida  But the Queen having an extraordinary Friendship for her hardly suffer'd her to be out of her Sight which made him fear his attempt wou'd be in vain This was the State of his Affairs when the King of  Tunis  invaded the Kingdom of  Fez  which oblig'd  Celima  to abandon  Sallee  and at the same time that she embark'd  Benavidez  and his Sister in disguise took their passage in one of the Ships which were bound for  Granada  During their Voyage they often saw  Leonida  aboard the Queen's Ship whose Sight only inflam'd  Benavidez  's Heart with Love and  Casilda  's  with Rage but the dreadful Storm which arose dispersing the Fleet their Ship was driven some Leagues beyond  Carthagena  where they landed and set out immediately on Horseback for  Granada Casilda  who was of a weak Constitution and already very much fatigu'd with her Voyage was left a great way behind which was the Occasion of her not arriving till after her Brother's Rencounter with the Prince of  Carency  which was then too late  I have already told you with what Marks of Honour and Distinction the Queen of  Fez  was receiv'd at her Arrival at the Court of  Granada  but I did not mention the magnificent Entertainment the King gave her at the Palace of  Alhambro  after which the Princes and most part of the Noblemen conducted her to the Castle of the  Abbaicyn  which was prepar'd for her and there took leave of her Majesty  As soon as she was at Liberty to give some time to Reflection she went to take the Air on a Terrace Walk adjoyning her Apartment which had a Prospect over the River  Daro  there a thousand hurrying Thoughts started from her Mind What Course shall I take said she to herself and whom shall I trust with my Secret Must I once more to the Shame of my Sex and Glory make my Weakness known to this lovely Stranger Heaven has sent him to me again and I am inclin'd to believe he is thinking on me Yes  certainly The  Apollo  pursuing  Daphne  which was painted on his Shield with his Motto nay more than that his languishing Looks and Distractions in short every thing persuades me he is in Love yet if it were with me ought not he to be inspir'd with some Motions of Sympathy which wou'd have told him that his Unknown of  Nicopolis  and the Queen of  Fez  were the same Why does he not discover as many Charms in my Person as he did in my Wit and Generosity Alas he was then too young to feel the Effects of Love Gratitude was the only thing that mov'd him to make a Return and I now fear some softer Care imploys his Thoughts But continu'd she I cannot persuade myself that Fortune has brought him once more in my way only to add fresh Afflictions to those I have already undergone I am rather dispos'd to look on this as the beginning of a Happiness which will end by the Destruction of my Enemies This Prince is nearly related to the King of  France  I will make myself a Christian and in giving him my Hand present him with my Crown He may head an Army and invade the Kingdom of  Fez  which he soon will be Master of The People by my Example will submit to his Laws and after being an unhappy Fugitive destitute of all Hopes I shall see myself Crown'd with unspeakable Felicity  Celima  thus indulg'd her Imagination till it grew so late that she thought fit to retire to her Apartment where  she pass'd the Night betwixt soft Repose and a Thousand agreeable Ideas which made her appear the next Day in all her Charms  But before the Queen wou'd admit of any Visit she sent for  Felicia  to whom she spoke in these Terms I am desirous to know whether your Sentiments for the Count of  La Vagne  are still the same therefore  Felicia  confess ingenuously the Truth Has not his Perfidiousness been capable to extinguish the Affection you had for him when you were persuaded of his Constancy Search well into your Heart for I have some Reason to enquire about it and whatever Answer you make me I shall not love you the less These Questions caus'd some Surprize in  Felicia  who at first had a mind to disguise her Sentiments but having consider'd that she had not long before confess'd her Weakness to the Queen she was of Opinion it was better to speak her Thoughts without any Dissimulation Madam reply'd she since they are your Majesty's Commands I cannot refuse obeying I own with the utmost Confusion that till now it has not been in my Power to banish from my Heart the fatal Idea of the Count of  La Vagne  I daily entertain myself with the Cause I have to hate him as the cruellest of my Enemies Yet alas it is past my Skill and I dare not even hope that time it self will ever be able to effect my Cure You do love him then interrupted the Queen If Love consists in often thinking of a Person reply'd  Felicia  I  am convinc'd I still have an Affection for him I may now confide in you reply'd the Queen therefore hear me and be secret  I was hardly out of my Infancy when my unlucky Stars decreed I shou'd fall into the Hands  Bajazet  whose Passion for me only increas'd my Aversion to him and I thought nothing cou'd be more deplorable than my Destiny  These were my Sentiments when he went into  Missia  and compell'd me to go along with him where after a Victory over the Christians he was desirous to see the Prisoners of Distinction who had been taken and as out of a politick Motive he endeavour'd to inspire me with Cruelty and inure me to Tragick Scenes he order'd I shou'd be placed at a Window which was grated and look'd over the Court where the Christians were to suffer Death and several Noblemen of  France  had already been executed when I saw a young Prince appear whose Beauty surpass'd that which we attribute to the God of Love He seem'd to be about Fifteen or Sixteen Years of Age he was tall wellshap'd and had fair Hair which hung in fine Curls on his Shoulders and in spite of his careless Air he had something so great and noble in his Mien that the other Princes were not to be compar'd to him Oh  Felicia  cou'd you but imagine what I felt in that Moment a quick Emotion seiz'd all my Soul I was troubled without knowing the Cause and in a Word had  like to have died for fear  Bajazet  shou'd have taken away a Life which was already dearer to me than my own I began to think what I cou'd do to deliver this lovely Prince from the immediate Danger which threaten'd him whether to fling myself at  Bajazet  's Feet and beg his Life or to offer myself a Victim in his Room for I cou'd have done any thing to save him but whilst a Thousand such Thoughts were torturing my Mind the Emperor resolv'd on accepting his Ransom which News so transported me that my Joy was inexpressible  This young Prince was Prisoner in the Tower of  Nicopolis  and as my Apartment had a Prospect of it I us'd to pass whole Days at my Closet Window in fruitless Sighs and Wishes but one Evening as I was endeavouring with the help of a Telescope to discover the Object I so dearly lov'd I perceiv'd him walking on the Leads of the Tower and he appear'd to me so melancholy that it threw me into the deepest Concern I immediately resolv'd on writing to him notwithstanding the Danger to which I expos'd myself if  Bajazet  had known it But Love is often more lucky than wise and Chance on that Occasion is a much better Servant than Reason When I had ended my Letter I confided it to an Eunuch who had attended me a long time and shew'd a particular Affection for my Service What did I not say to persuade him to be faithful which having promis'd me  even at the hazard of his Life he convey'd my Letter to the Top of the Tower by means of an Arrow and the Prince having receiv'd it sent me an Answer which entirely vanquish'd me I was inform'd that his Ransom was not come and the more I consider'd how dear he daily grew to me the greater Cause I had to fear equally for him and myself I was perfectly acquainted with  Bajazet  's inhuman Temper and too sensible of my own Weakness to believe that it wou'd be in my Power to fly a Prince who so entirely possess'd my Thoughts These Considerations oblig'd me to take Measures for his immediate Departure but alas What Torments did not I endure thro' the Necessity of so cruel a Resolution  To this Effect I was forc'd once more to confide in my Eunuch who brib'd one of the Prince's Guards by whose means a strong Box was convey'd into his Chamber wherein I sent him a considerable Sum to pay his Ransom and a Letter which was the last I wrote to him being bereft of the hopes of ever seeing him more Imagine  Felicia  how many anxious Hours I have pass'd since that unlucky Day  Soon after  Bajazet  's Fortune met with an unhappy Change for  Tamerlane  having engag'd him gain'd a compleat Victory and took him Prisoner It was with no small difficulty I made my Escape and return'd to my Father's Dominions where I was no sooner arriv'd but several Kings and Princes made their Addresses  to me some out of Ambition and others out of a sincere Love for my Person but I was so entirely prepossess'd with the Idea of him who had charm'd me at  Nicopolis  that nothing at  Sallee  was capable of making an Impression on me so in spight of myself I was in Love without Hopes of a return This was the State of my Mind at my Arrival here but how can I express the Surprize and Agitation I was in when amongst the Noblemen who came to receive me out of the Gates of the Town I perceiv'd the Man I love This Christian Prince under the Name and Dress of a  Moor  appear'd to me as charming as ever no it's impossible for you to comprehend what I felt at so unexpected a Rencounter My Heart was seiz'd with so many different Motions that I was not able to speak and whilst I was endeavouring to recover myself  Assimir  for that is the Name he goes by at this Court approach'd and gave me an Occasion to see the Motto that was painted on his Shield which persuaded me the Memory of his Unknown of  Nicopolis  was dear to him I must confess I was equally surpriz'd and overjoy'd for I cou'd not flatter myself with being still in the Thoughts of that young Prince who had not the same Motives to inspire him I had seen him and was inform'd of his Name and Birth but he had neither seen me nor knew who I was therefore what had touch'd him was either Gratitude or the obliging Expressions of my  Letters which I must say are no small Attractives to a generous Soul  In short  Felicia  I have a mind that you shou'd talk with him and endeavour to discover his Sentiments The Management of this Affair which I intrust you with is of a nice quality but as you are very discreet I cannot imploy any one who will give me less Suspicion tho' I must own my Weakness to you I am naturally of a jealous Temper and a Confidant so beautiful as you with  Assimir  's Merit might give me some Apprehension were it not that you are entirely prepossess'd in favour of the Count of  La Vagne Felicia  threw her self at the Queen's Feet and kissing her Hand with great Respect said to her I have so true a Sense Madam of the Honour you do me when you are pleas'd to confide in me that I cannot easily express my Acknowledgments for so high a Favour but whatever Ambition I have to serve your Majesty I am strangely diffident of my Capacity for I know that in so important an Affair one cannot act too prudently which makes me fear I shall not answer the good Opinion you have conceiv'd of me What reply'd the Queen wou'd you yield to another the advantage of doing me a piece of Service Is not your Affection for me great enough to prevent you from acting those Faults you foresee  Felicia  understood by what the Queen said to her that her Majesty wou'd be highly disoblig'd shou'd she neglect so fair an Opportunity  of serving her therefore considering the unhappy State of her Captivity she made no other Reply but that she was ready to obey her Commands You must then write to  Assimir  said the Queen and desire him to meet you on the Terrace adjoyning my Apartment where you shall entertain him with some Particulars relating to me  Felicia  immediately retir'd in order to write to  Assimir  and finding  Inea  in her Chamber she gave her an Account what had pass'd between the Queen and her then wrote her Letter in these Terms  THO' I am unknown to you my Lord and you also a Stranger to me I have a mighty desire to entertain you which perhaps you may think very extraordinary If you will be pleas'd to meet me this Evening on the Terrace Walk next to the Queen of  Fez  's Apartment I shall there explain my self more at large  Felicia  This Letter  Felicia  shew'd to the Queen who call'd for one of her Pages and charg'd him to go and deliver it to  Assimir  who as I told you before was extremely afflicted at what  Casilda  under the Disguise of Don  Sanche  had spitefully intimated concerning  Felicia  The mean while  Zulema  who had stay'd by the Prince was saying all he cou'd to soften his Distress and as he was talking to him they came to tell  Assimir  that one of the  Queen of  Fez  's Pages had a Letter to deliver to him This caus'd some Emotion in the Prince who looking at his Friend Can you conceive said he what may be the meaning of this Letter If I may believe my Thoughts reply'd  Zulema  they persuade me some agreeable News is coming to you my Lord Whatever it be said the Prince I desire you will speak to the Page I am unwilling to see him for fear he shou'd discover the Disorder I am in  Zulema  readily satisfy'd the Prince's Impatience he took the Letter and brought it to him which he no sooner open'd but knew the Name and Writing Heavens How great was his Surprize He cou'd not conceal his Transports but giving the Letter back to  Zulema  said am I in a Dream or must I believe what I see Is my  Felicia  in  Granada  whilst I am bemoaning her Absence and bereft of all Hopes of ever seeing her more  Zulema  my dear  Zulema  how can I outlive so unexpected a Felicity Indeed my Lord reply'd his Friend I am sensibly touch'd at your good Fortune and heartily congratulate you but am afraid you will go to the Palace of  Abbaicyn  before your Wound is heal'd which may prove very dangerous to you Were I to hazard my Life answer'd the Prince I wou'd not defer the Pleasure of seeing her and as I am not able to write I desire you wou'd do it for me I am assur'd said  Zulema  that she does not know the Condition you are in  otherwise she wou'd be very much concern'd at the little Care you take of a Life which ought to be dear to her but I am ready to do any thing my Lord to oblige you so the Prince dictated these Lines  YOU are not so great a Stranger to me as you imagine adorable  Felicia  I do not doubt but you will be convinc'd of it assoon as I have the Pleasure of Saluting you I have had the Misfortune of receiving a Wound which very much discomposes me yet nothing shall prevent me attending your Commands  Whilst the passionate Prince was abandoning himself to a Thousand Transports of Joy and Impatience the Page deliver'd his Letter to the Queen who having read it was seiz'd with the deepest Chagrin Was any Fatality like this cry'd she  Assimir  is acquainted with  Felicia  and says he will attend her tho' he is wounded What Accident cou'd have happen'd to him since Yesterday Sure there must needs be an intimate Understanding between  Felicia  and him tho' she has conceal'd it from me I thought her Sentiments for the Count of  La Vagne  wou'd have left me no room to apprehend any thing from her But alas How deceiv'd have I been Well I am resolv'd she shall neither see him nor speak to him As  Celima  was thus reasoning with herself  Felicia  enter'd her Chamber  Assimir  said the Queen to her has receiv'd  your Letter and is very much indispos'd therefore cou'd not write to you  Felicia  seem'd concern'd at his Illness thinking by that means to pay her Court to the Queen but she cou'd not have taken a more indirect Step towards it for  Celima  was so prepossess'd with the Opinion of  Felicia  's having a Correspondence with the Prince that the most innocent Actions of this young Slave in her Eyes appear'd Criminal  The King of  Granada  being now indispos'd sent his two Sons to visit  Celima  whom they invited to take the Air in the Forest this Queen accepted the Invitation and as  Assimir  Illness had been confirm'd to her by the Princes  Mahomet  and  Osmin  she did not in the least imagine that he wou'd venture to go abroad besides  Celima  had observ'd that  Osmin  was mightily taken with  Felicia  which extremely pleas'd her for she wou'd not have cared had all the Monarchs of the Universe ador'd that lovely Captive so the Prince of  Carency  had but look'd on her Indifference  Thus the Court set out from the Palace of  Abbaicyn  follow'd by a great Number of musical Instruments All the Ladies were seated in little open Chariots each of them having a Cavalier to drive them  Mahomet  drove the Queen of  Fez  's Chariot and  Osmin Felicia  's As they were going by the Palace of  Alhambro  the Queen desired she might stop a little to enquire after the King's Health  Zulema  hearing that  Celima  was coming to the Palace told the Prince she shou'd pass under his Windows and that if he was able to rise perhaps he might see  Felicia  Heavens cry'd the Prince what wou'd not I do for so dear a Satisfaction With that he leap'd out of Bed and having put on some Clothes went and sat in one of the Balconies of his Apartment where soon after he saw  Celima  and  Felicia  attending her  Osmin  perceiving the Prince desired this beauteous Lady to take Notice of him but how shall I express the Motions which seiz'd her Soul when she knew him to be her Lover The Prince of  Carency  on the other side was so transported that he was just going to speak to her had not  Zulema  persuaded him to the contrary  Felicia  was in such a disorder that at first she knew not what to say but being extremely desirous to be inform'd by what Chance her false Lover happen'd to be in  Granada  for she took him for the Count of  La Vagne  she recover'd herself a little and told  Osmin  that the Person he had shewn her appear'd to be a Stranger You judge right Madam reply'd he for he is a  Genouese  of the noble House of  Fiesques  The late King having besieg'd  Jean  took him Prisoner and sent him to the Castle of  Salobrena  where my Father my Bother and I were confin'd There I contracted an intimate Friendship with the Count of  La Vagne  that's his Title and after  Mahomet  's Death my Father coming to the Throne  conceiv'd so particular an Esteem for this illustrious Count that he gave him his Liberty upon Condition that he wou'd not part from  Granada  without his Consent therefore he still remains with us and we are daily charm'd with his noble and polite Behaviour  These Encomiums which  Osmin  gave to the Count were very acceptable to  Felicia  notwithstanding the Reasons she had to be dissatisfy'd with his Conduct She then ask'd him when the Count had been taken Prisoner but nothing cou'd astonish her more than what  Osmin  told her on that Subject for either the Scene which pass'd at  Sallee  between  Olympia  the Count and her was a Vision which she had no room to believe or what  Osmin  was saying to her cou'd not be sincere This made her impatient to be with  Inea  to entertain her with this surprizing Adventure and she grew of a sudden so pensive that she cou'd not make any Reply to the obliging Terms in which  Osmin  address'd her What is it that troubles you divine  Felicia  said he to her You seem very melancholy do but confide in me and I will use my best Endeavours to deserve so great a Favour Alas my Lord reply'd  Felicia  with a dejected Air what Secret cou'd I impart to you I am an unfortunate Captive and perhaps I repine at the Cruelty of that Destiny from whence flows the Sorrow which you perceive Vouchsafe Madam said  Osmin  to accept of my Service I may procure you your Liberty and soon  remove the Cause of your Uneasiness but you must at least give me leave to pay Homage to your transcendent Charms since they have inspir'd me with such Sentiments as do not merit a disobliging Return I conjure you amiable  Felicia  to be favourable to me and let me feed my Passion with the Hopes of your Affection I cannot answer your Request my Lord interrupted  Felicia  I have too great a Regard for you and as an Evincement of it I declare that I am neither desirous to be belov'd nor dispos'd to receive an Impression It is a Resolution I have made which nothing shall induce me to change therefore I intreat you my Lord never to think on me more This Confession extremely surpriz'd  Osmin  who wou'd rather have met with more Dissimulation and less Cruelty But as Love is always deluding he did not doubt but in time he shou'd conquer an Indifference which he thought unreasonable  The Court being return'd from the Forest  Celima  whose Thoughts were entirely imploy'd on her Rendezvous with the Prince of  Carency  retir'd to her Palace and  Felicia  went to her Chamber where she found  Inea  whom she embrac'd tenderly and said How shall I express to you my Dear the Agitation of my Mind The Count of  La Vagne  is here I have just seen him in the Palace of  Alhambro  it is no Imagination for he saluted me so respectfully that I cou'd not help returning the Civility and I am even asham'd of having discover'd  my Weakness to a Man who has deserv'd my Aversion But alas when Love commands Reason must obey I have something yet more surprizing to tell you continu'd she I am inform'd he has been some Months in  Andalusia  and by the Relation I have heard I find he was taken Prisoner about the time that I had a Dream at  Sallee  which represented him to me engag'd with the  Moors  and vanquish'd  Osmin  told me the Count had been ever since in the Castle of  Salobrena  or at  Granada  but I fancy he desired him to speak to me in that manner with a Design to screen his Offence for who knows whether he does not repent his unworthy Behaviour towards me moreover I am surpriz'd not to see  Olympia  here which makes me believe the  Moors  took the Count at Sea and that he has not been long in these Dominions It is very probable interrupted  Inea  for what pass'd at  Sallee  is not to be contradicted and perhaps he is now sorry for having disobliged you therefore you must resolve to pardon him No my dear  Inea  reply'd  Felicia  I shall never forget his Ingratitude he is still dear to me I confess yet I hope in time to banish him from my Heart Oh Heavens added she weeping what a Series of Misfortunes attend me I must tell you something more young  Osmin  has declar'd himself my Votary and you may judge how favourably I receiv'd his Addresses  Whilst  Felicia  and  Inea  were discoursing together the Queen of  Fez  sent for the Governess of the Slaves who as I told you before was an ugly old Woman and commanded her to wrap herself in her Veil and wait on the Terrace for the Prince of  Carency  's Arrival she charg'd her at the same time not to discover herself but to appear overjoy'd at seeing him in case he took her for  Felicia  It was a MoonLight Night and the amorous Prince leaning on  Casilda  whom he took for a young Man was making as much haste towards the Place appointed as his Strength wou'd permit him and perceiving at a distance a tall Person walking on the Terrace he did not doubt but it was his charming  Felicia  therefore approaching her he said Ah Madam has Fortune brought you to me again after having so long bemoan'd your Absence and spent Days and Nights endeavouring to find you I can hardly believe my Eyes Is it you yourself my divine Mistress Here transported with Love and Joy he went to throw off this Woman's Veil who not being quick enough to take hold of it let it fall on the Ground and discover'd a Face which was as Ugly as  Felicia  's was Beautiful  His Astonishment was so great that he cou'd not help crying out aloud and any one might have perceiv'd by his Emotion the strange Disorder he was in The Queen being in a Closet that look'd on the Terrace Walk easily saw the Prince's Action and knew  his Voice which made her guess what had pass'd therefore approaching him with a Majestick Air I am come to your Assistance Prince said she taking his Hand and smiling follow me I have something to tell you which is of too great a Consequence to be conceal'd from you any longer  The Queen went in first but  Casilda  being oblig'd to wait without was mighty uneasy concerning what might pass between  Celima  and the Prince This inquisitive Creature stay'd till the Governess of the Slaves was retired then plac'd herself near the Closet where she cou'd easily hear their Conversation The Queen looking at the Prince who was not well recover'd from his Surprize I have been imploying my Skill for you my Lord said she and by the help of my Books and the Figures I have cast am already acquainted with some of your Adventures moreover I can assure you that I interest myself very much in what concerns you and if you will be sincere with me I do not in the least doubt but I shall be able by the Assistance of my powerful Art to put you in a way of overcoming your ill Fortune I am persuaded Madam reply'd the Prince that a Sovereign who has so great an Influence as your Majesty may easily change my Destiny without consulting the Stars yet I cannot flatter myself with deserving so extraordinary a Favour As an Evincement of the Progress I have already made said  Celima  I know  Assimir  is not your Name  and that by your Birth you are nearly related to a great King  The Prince of  Carency  was amaz'd to hear the Queen express herself in these Terms and before he cou'd make her any Answer Nay continu'd she you will own my Knowledge is no Fiction when I tell you that you was in  Misia  and taken Prisoner by  Bajazet  besides whilst you were in the Tower of  Nicopolis  did not you receive very passionate Letters and a considerable Supply from a Lady who to this Hour is unknown to you The Prince sigh'd and seeing  Celima  waited an Answer It is as your Majesty says reply'd he and since you are so well inform'd of what has happen'd to me I beg Madam you will tell me who was that charming Unknown This Request extremely pleas'd the Queen who concealing her Satisfaction said to him Out of what Motive do you desire to know this Lady perhaps you may never see her That is a Misfortune I fear Madam interrupted the Prince yet I often flatter myself that some lucky Chance will convey me were she is But added the Queen in an Accent which discover'd part of her Sentiments is it possible that the Memory of a Person can be still dear to you who had no other Attractive to engage you but her writing a few obliging Letters and sending you a Sum of Money to pay your Ransom Ah Madam reply'd he there are Impressions which never can be effac'd and cou'd you conceive the Torments I have  endured for that Unknown you wou'd soon be convinc'd that one may feel the sharpest Darts of Love without seeing the influencing Object Is it then really true said the Queen that you are impatient to see her and that she often imploys your Thoughts I declare it is sincerely so Madam answer'd the Prince and there is nothing I wish more ardently than an Opportunity of making my Retributions to a Lady who has conferr'd so high an Obligation on me Well Prince said  Celima  smiling I will consult with some favourable Genius in order to compleat your Desire Come to me to Morrow at the same Hour and you shall be farther inform'd of this Subject The Prince return'd his Acknowledgments to her in a most grateful Manner and retir'd to the Palace of  Alhambro  with the disguis'd  Casilda  who was waiting on the Terrace  Zulema  impatient to know what had pass'd at the  Abbaicyn  repair'd soon after to the Prince's Apartment and  Casilda  who perceiv'd they had some matter of Importance to communicate to one another feigning to withdraw went and hid herself in a Place where she cou'd hear their Conversation You think perhaps said the Prince to  Zulema  that I have seen  Felicia  and am going to inform you of the Particulars of an agreeable Rendezvous but instead of that my dear Friend I must tell you some  Daemon  appear'd to me in the Shape of an ugly old Creature and that I was in the greatest Astonishment when the  Queen of  Fez  came upon the Terrace and desired me to follow her into her Closet where I no sooner enter'd but she endeavour'd to persuade me that she had acquired an extraordinary Knowledge by corresponding with good and evil Genius's and in reality she told me every thing relating to my Adventure at  Nicopolis  which very much surpriz'd me for she certainly must have been inform'd of it by the Unknown herself whom I believe is now amongst her Slaves and I cannot put it out of my Head but  Felicia  wrote to me by the Queen's Orders  Here the Prince was some time silent and  Zulema  spoke to him in these Terms I begin to have a Thought which appears to me very probable and you may judge of it your self my Lord when I have inform'd you that  Celima  herself was at  Nicopolis  at the time that the Christians were defeated by  Bajazet  As you were of the number of the Prisoners it is likely she saw you and receiv'd an Impression besides if you consider the Present which was sent you in the Tower it cou'd not come from a Person of an inferiour Rank andYou give me such a Light into the matter interrupted the Prince as opens my Eyes at once I cannot call to mind what the Queen said to me the Day of her Arrival and the Conversation we have just had together without being convinc'd that she is my Unknown of  Nicopolis  Alas into what a Labyrinth am I fallen  Felicia  is with her  and if she discovers my Passion for that lovely Creature I fear she will make her feel the Effects of her Revenge Ah cruel Destiny cry'd he am I born only to pass my Days in a continual Series of Woes and have you decreed that I shall never be happy Here the tormenting Thoughts of his past Disappointment came fresh to his Mind and interrupting his Discourse threw him into so deep a Melancholy that even his Friend  Zulema  endeavour'd unsuccessfully to divert it therefore as it was late he took his leave of the Prince tho' extremely concern'd at not having it in his Power to give him some Relief  Whilst the Prince and  Zulema  were entertaining each other  Casilda  heard their whole Conversation and finding she had no hopes left of ever touching the Heart of a Prince for whom she had already acted many Extravagances she resolv'd on some desperate Undertaking Her Revenge against her Rival was more predominant than either the Passion she had for the Prince or her own Honour so that nothing less than the Death of the unhappy  Leonida  cou'd satisfy her raging Spirit  The Queen of  Fez  extremely overjoy'd at what the Prince of  Carency  had said to her was forming a thousand agreeable Projects not doubting but his Passion for his Unknown of  Nicopolis  was very sincere and that he wou'd be equally transported to find she was the Person yet as her Jealousy of  Felicia  gave her much Uneasiness she thought it prudent  first to clear her Suspicions on that Subject for said she if the Prince has seen that beautiful Captive he must needs love her therefore I will contrive they shall meet in a place where I may hear their Discourse which will give me some Insight into the matter  Celima  immediately sent for  Felicia  and being alone with her I command you said she to be sincere with me Consider you are my Slave and that your Destiny is in my Power I can make you happy if you will confess the Truth Read this continu'd she shewing her the Letter which the Prince of  Carency  had desired  Zulema  to write do you know the Writing  Felicia  read it and having examin'd it some time told the Queen she sincerely cou'd not tell whose Hand it was which in some Measure satisfy'd  Celima  yet to be thoroughly convinc'd in an Affair that so nearly concern'd her Tell me said she have you ever heard of the House of  Bourbon  related to the Kings of  France Felicia  at this Question did not doubt but the Queen knew her and without being any ways out of Countenance reply'd that the Name of so illustrious a Family was not unknown to her And are you acquainted with any one of that Name said  Celima  Did not you see the Count of  La March  or the Prince of  Carency  when you were in  Spain  No Madam answer'd she I never saw those Princes they are intire Strangers to me Know then  Felicia  interrupted the Queen of  Fez  that the Person  I spoke of and who appear'd so charming to me is of the House of  Bourbon  and is call'd the Prince of  Carency  I have a mind you shou'd talk with him and endeavour to penetrate into his Sentiments he came here last Night when I order'd the Governess of the Slaves to entertain him but she managed the matter so very ill that I must wholly depend upon you Had the Queen's Thoughts been less prepossess'd with her Project she might have discover'd  Felicia  's Surprize when she heard the Prince of  Carency  was the Person whom the Queen lov'd and that he was actually in  Granada  But her mind being otherways employ'd this young Slave had time to recover from her Disorder and said to  Celima  Your Pleasure Madam is so dear to me that I fear I shall not be able to effect your Majesty's Commands with Success for I have but very little Experience and shou'd I miscarry in an Affair which requires so much Prudence I cou'd never forgive myself No reply'd the Queen do not let that give you the least Uneasiness I know you better than you know yourself and am persuaded you cannot do any thing amiss But as the Moon shines very bright I do not think it proper you shou'd meet the Prince on the Terrace because I saw many People walking there last Night and it wou'd not be convenient I shou'd be seen with him therefore I will give Orders that he may be convey'd to the Grotto in the Wood where you may entertain him till I come to you  Felicia  having receiv'd her Instructions retir'd to her Chamber very much troubled which  Inea  peceiving Lovely  Felicia  said she do not conceal your Thoughts but tell me the Cause of your Pain Ah my dear  Inea  cry'd  Felicia  nothing but fresh Afflictions attend me The Prince of  Carency  is in  Granada  and goes by the Name of  Assimir  'tis he whom the Queen loves and by her Command I am to have an Interview with him this Evening What interrupted  Inea  can that give you any Uneasiness Do you consider that Heaven has sent him here to put a Period to your Miseries He will procure you your Liberty and carry you back to your native Land where all your Wishes will be crown'd with Felicity whilst unfortunate  Inea  absent from her dear  Don Ramire  must pass the Remainder of her Life in Tears and Captivity You bewail your Destiny reply'd  Felicia  and you think that my being united to the Prince of  Carency  will make mine happier Alas you are very much deceiv'd for we have conceiv'd a secret Antipathy for each other and must never expect a perfect Satisfaction in our Alliance Besides do you imagine that I can so easily banish the Count of  La Vagne  from my Thoughts In spite of his Infidelity he is still dear to me and it's probable he is now sorry for having offended me at least his Eyes tell me so and his Repentance may deserve Pardon In short  Inea  I believe he loves me but let it be as it will  the Prince shall not know who I am As he has seen my Picture he may call to mind its Resemblance therefore I will hid my Face so well that he shall not see it  Inea  finding  Felicia  was fix'd on that Resolution wou'd not any ways oppose it tho' she was of a contrary Opinion  The Prince of  Carency  was now thinking on means to convey a Letter to  Felicia  in order to know how he might have an Opportunity of entertaining her He told his Design to  Zulema  who advis'd him not to write for fear his Letter shou'd fall into the Hands of the Queen of  Fez  but promis'd him he wou'd contrive some way to speak to her By this time the Hour of the Prince's Appointment was near yet he made no great haste to go to the Palace for he began to reflect that a Second Interview with  Celima  wou'd only puzzle him because he believ'd she was his Unknown of  Nicopolis  and that were she inform'd of his Passion for  Felicia  it might prove of a fatal Consequence  Zulema  put him in mind to repair to his  Rendezvous  at last taking the suppos'd  Don Sanche  with him he went with some Reluctancy to the  Abbaicyn  where he found a Mute waiting on the Terrace who convey'd him to the Grotto  Felicia  came soon after so entirely hidden from Head to Foot in a large white Veil that it was impossible to know her The Prince did not doubt in seeing her but it was the same old Woman he  had met the Night before which made him resolve not to have any discourse with her  Felicia  on the other side who felt strange Emotions finding her self at that Instant with the Prince of  Carency  was some time without speaking but she had scarcely broke Silence when the Prince knowing the Voice of his lovely Mistress went and flung himself at her Feet  Leonida  Charming  Leonida  said he what a Blessing is this Have I found you at last and have you still the same obliging Sentiments for me which you had when I was in the House of the Traitor  Benavidez Leonida  calling to mind what had pass'd at  Sallee  was griev'd at this Discourse Go said she breaking out into a Passion go ungrateful Man have you forgot the Cause you have given me to upbraid you The Prince thinking she was angry that he had conceal'd his Name from her I am guilty Madam I confess reply'd he for not having confided in you I ought to have told you that I was the Prince of  Carency  and not have appear'd under an other Title but the cruel Designs of  Leonora  by whose Orders I was pursued when I parted from  VillaReal  and wounded in the Forest where you found me was the Occasion I chang'd my Name and took that of the Count of  La Vagne  whom I very much resembled This is my only Crime divine  Leonida  sure it is not so enormous as to be unpardonable Whilst the Prince was talking in this manner  Leonida  whose Surprize was great had a thousand different Imaginations and cou'd not tell what Judgment to make At last the Prince impatient to hear her speak Ah Madam said he how much do I dread that you are no more the same for me Here you see me at your Feet in Transports of inexpressible Joy whilst you my Beauteous Mistress are indifferent and melancholy What disobliging Sentiments have you receiv'd for a Man who adores you and whom Destiny has decreed to be yours Do you consider that I am going to offer up to you the Remainder of my Life and that from the fatal Moment I lost you no Torment cou'd be equal to that I endured Be assur'd Madam that the Prince of  Carency  has a Passion for you no ways inferior to that which you found in the Count of  La Vagne  I must own to you my Lord reply'd  Leonida  that I cannot believe what I hear for when you were at  Sallee  you even treated me with Disdain What greater Offence cou'd you give me than to abandon me as you did and go away with  Olympia Doria  whom you passionately lov'd Do you think my Senses cou'd deceive me or that I am not capable of resenting the Perfidy I cannot tell to this Hour whether you are the Prince of  Carency  or the Count of  La Vagne  but what I am certain of is that you are the Person who has highly injured me and it wou'd be a shameful Weakness in me to pardon you These Words strangely confounded the Prince  who believ'd his dear  Leonida  's Mind was discompos'd and what confirm'd this Opinion was his being persuaded that the Count of  La Vagne  perished at Sea in his Return from  Nicopolis  and that  Olympia Doria  died in her Father's House at  Genoa  These were Circumstances he cou'd no ways doubt of and as for his Voyage to  Sallee  he had never been there so that he look'd on all her Reproaches as Visionary which threw him into a despairing Condition yet he wou'd not let her perceive the Trouble he was in nor what occasion'd it but continu'd speaking to her in a very obliging manner You do me a great deal of Wrong Charming  Leonida  said he to her sighing and I shou'd not find it a very hard Task to justify myself tho' I fancy I have the most Cause to complain What must I judge of the Letter you writ to  Casilda  when you and  Benavidez  contriv'd your going off which was a thing I cou'd never have believ'd you guilty of And what shall I conjecture from your being at  Constantinople  and the Grand Seignior's Passion for you  Leonida  heard the Prince with Astonishment and thought likewise he knew not what he said she cou'd not imagine how a Man of so good Sense cou'd talk after such an extravagant manner and as her Affection was more predominant than her Resentment she was sensibly griev'd at his Misfortune Who I my Lord cry'd she did I write to  Casilda  or give my Consent to  Benavidez  's insolent Behaviour and was I ever  in  Turkey  These Things are so new to me and so far from being true that I cannot bear to hear 'em How long have you entertained these Chimeras Here she took the Prince's Hand and cou'd not restrain her Tears which proof of her Tenderness with the other Circumstances so thoroughly touch'd him that he was soon convinc'd of her Sincerity Let us do Justice to each other most amiable  Leonida  said the Prince printing an ardent Kiss on her fair Hand be assur'd I never was false to you I shou'd be willing to satisfy you interrupted  Leonida  cou'd I forget the Adventure which happen'd to me lately at  Sallee  She then recited to him her whole Story with so much Wit and Coherence that he perceiv'd what he had taken for an Effect of Lunacy was supported by solid Appearances therefore having explain'd matters they came to a right Understanding which created unspeakable Transports in these two Lovers  One may easily imagine the Consternation of  Casilda  who had heard their whole Discourse and was distracted to see so perfect a Sympathy between  Leonida  and the Prince All her Perifidiousness as well as her Brother's was laid open and seeing herself frustrated of those hopes which had flatter'd her till then she had like in her excessive Despair to have enter'd the Grotto with a full design to stab  Leonida  but as she consider'd that the Prince wou'd prevent the Blow and disappoint her revengful Attempt she deferr'd her wicked Action  till she found a fairer Opportunity of executing it  After  Leonida  and the Prince of  Carency  had given each other reciprocal Assurances of their Joy and Affection they consulted how they shou'd behave themselves towards the Queen of  Fez  till they cou'd find an Opportunity of going off While they were on this Subject the Queen came to the Grotto but I must tell you what prevented her from repairing thither sooner  As  Celima  was coming out of her Apartment they told her that  Mahomet  was in the Palace and had something of the highest Importance to communicate to her She had given Orders that no body shou'd be admitted that Evening yet as that Prince's Visit seem'd to import some weighty matter she wou'd not refuse seeing him  Mahomet  addressing the Queen told her that  Mula  Favorite to  Abelhamar  was just arriv'd from  Fez  with a Letter to her from his Master and that being a particular Acquaintance of his he had apply'd to him for a private Audience which if she was pleas'd to grant he wou'd immediately send for him Tho'  Celima  was very impatient to be at her  Rendezvous  with the Prince of  Carency  yet on this Occasion she was forc'd to yield to her Politicks fearing that if she shou'd defer this Affair till the next Day  Mahomet  might suspect she was imploy'd in some more agreeable Occupation therefore having assented to  Mula  's Admittance  he came and threw himself at the Queen's Feet and presented her with a Letter from the Prince his Master which was written in these Terms  THO' I have an indisputable Right to the Kingdom of  Fez  and am now in the Possession of it yet I am willing Madam to yield up one half of it to you upon Condition that you will give me  Felicia  Before I had seen her nothing cou'd be equal to my Ambition but now her Charms have made so deep an Impression in my Heart that all other Passions have submitted to my transcendent Love I can never be happy without her and if I am indebted to you for the Possession of that lovely Creature half my Kingdom will be too small a Return for so high an Obligation therefore grant me but your Slave and I will acknowledge you for my Sovereign  Abelhamar  Celima  having read this Letter in the Presence of  Mahomet  they both admired  Abelhamar  's Passion for  Felicia  and as  Mahomet  's Vows were already dedicated to the Queen of  Fez  he was overjoy'd to find that this Occasion afforded her sure means of recovering at least one part of her Dominions He joyn'd with  Mula  in his Proposals and offer'd to go himself with  Felicia  to  Sallee  in order to bring back with him such Hostages from  Abelhamar  as shou'd warrant the performance of the Treaty  Celima  with a gracious Air return'd  Mahomet  Thanks and assur'd him she shou'd never forget the generous manner in which he espous'd her Interest but as  Abelhamar  's Proposals requir'd some Consideration she desired her Answer might be suspended till the next Day then  Mula  withdrew and left the Prince there who took so great a Pleasure in entertaining the Queen that he did not retire till it was late which gave time to the Prince of  Carency  and his Mistress to take some Measures relating to their particular Affairs  Mahomet  having taken leave of the Queen she immediately went to the Grotto where being enter'd  Leonida  out of Respect retir'd and left her alone with the Prince of  Carency  This lovely Captive was walking in the Wood with her Thoughts entirely imploy'd on the Happiness she propos'd to herself thro' the means of her faithful Lover but alas Fate was preparing a New Tragedy  Casilda  still under a Man's Disguise distracted with Jealousy at what she had just heard and seeing her Rival walking alone thought she might easily pierce her Heart before any one cou'd come to her Assistance so running up to her like a Fury she drew out her Poinard and plung'd it into  Leonida  's Breast who fell with the Blow crying out for help and calling the Prince of  Carency  at which Name  Casilda  was possess'd with such inhuman Rage that she repeated her Blows The Grotto not being distant the Prince was struck at the mournful Accents of his wounded Mistress  and leaving the Queen suddenly he made haste toward the Place where he heard  Leonida  's Voice he saw her lying on the Ground bath'd in Blood and perceiv'd  Don Sanche  running away which convinc'd him that he was the Murderer he immediately pursu'd him and with his Sword run him through After he had thus reveng'd unfortunate  Leonida  he came up to her but oh what a lamentable Condition did he find her in She express'd herself with painful Sighs and had searce Strength enough to take her Lover's Hand which made him fear her beauteous Eyes were going to yield up all their Charms to that universal Conqueror Death  How shall I here paint the disconsolate State of our unhappy Prince he was resolv'd not to survive so great a Misfortune and had already turn'd the Point of his Sword to his Breast when the Queen who had follow'd him out of the Grotto interpos'd and prevented him from acting his own Death She repeated her Shrieks in so pressing a manner that the Guards immediately came up to her and soon after most of her Attendants with a great Number of Flambeaux which shew'd all the Horror of this Tragick Scene It was not long before they were inform'd of it at the Palace of  Alhambro  The two Princes  Mahomet  and  Osmin  came to the  Abbaicyn  with  Mula  and another Gentleman who had accompanyed him in his Voyage from  Sallee  In short the Wood was full of People who were in  a strange Consternation  Leonida  wounded lying in the Arms of a despairing Prince who was near losing his Mistress mov'd all Hearts with Compassion  On the other hand  Casilda  that wretched Creature was tearing open her Wounds to hasten her deserv'd Death  Zulema  approach'd her and still thinking she was a Man Ah Barbarous Villain that you are cry'd he to her what  Daemon  urg'd you to commit a Crime so black Tell me what had innocent  Felicia  done to you and how came you to murder her in this cruel manner I am  Casilda  reply'd she with a furious Air and she was my Rival go to your Friend and he will tell you the rest These were the last and only Words she pronounc'd with her expiring Breath  Tho'  Leonida  's Life was despair'd of yet the Surgeons were sent for who us'd all their Skill to stop the bleeding of her Wounds which they dress'd and having assisted her with proper Remedies her Spirits began to revive She open'd her weak Eyes then fix'd them on the Prince who held her in his Arms and appear'd in as great want of Relief as his dying Mistress At last they took her from him and carry'd her by the Queen's Order to her Chamber where she was laid in Bed and  Inea  who had a tender Affection for  Leonida  staid by her almost inconsolable for the unlucky Accident which had happen'd to her illustrious Companion She was so sensibly touch'd  at it that even the Presence of  Don Ramire  cou'd not mitigate her excessive Grief He was just arriv'd from  Fez  where he had been in Expectation of finding his dear  Inea  who had sent him a Letter whilst he was at  Morocco  to acquaint him with her Captivity But before he cou'd reach  Sallee  the Queen was embark'd which oblig'd him to wait there for a favourable Opportunity of coming over to  Granada  and as about this time  Mula  was setting out for that Kingdom he took his Passage in the same Ship  Osmin  who had a real Passion for  Leonida  was thoroughly concern'd at her Misfortune and as for the Queen of  Fez  she cou'd not help being mov'd at this dismal Adventure tho' she prudently conceal'd her Thoughts The Prince of  Carency  's mournful Complaints too well confirm'd her Suspicions in relation to his Sentiments for  Leonida  and she saw him possess'd with so violent a Despair that she had no room left for any hopes no not even to come to an Agreement with  Abelhamar  for in the first Place she was convinc'd that shou'd  Leonida  die of her Wounds her Death wou'd render his Proposals of no Effect and on the other Hand she foresaw that if she recover'd the Prince wou'd claim her as one perhaps he had lov'd a long time and whom he intended to marry  As for  Mula  he was so amaz'd that he cou'd scarcely believe his own Eyes for tho' he was present when his Master fought the  brave Count of  La Vagne  and kill'd him and that he saw him give up his last Breath in  Olympia  's Arms yet he cou'd not be persuaded but the Prince of  Carency  was that same Count so great was their Resemblance  The Prince all this while was like a Man whose Senses had abandon'd him and in that Condition the Queen of  Fez  gave Orders that he shou'd be carry'd into one of the Apartments of the  Abbaicyn  where being laid on a Bed his Wound open'd afresh and there gush'd from it a great Quantity of Blood which alarm'd all his Friends particularly  Osmin  who look'd on him as his Rival and notwithstanding shew'd a sincere Trouble for his Misfortune as well as his generous Friend  Zulema  No body cou'd now tell who was in the greatest Danger the Prince of  Carency  or  Leonida  they both continu'd extremely ill His excessive Grief for the Condition of his beloved Mistress retarded his Recovery till they assur'd him there was Hopes of her Life which agreeable News caus'd so wonderful an Effect in him that his Wound was soon heal'd and in a few Days he was able to visit her who was also in no small Concern for the State of her Lover's Health The Presence of this lovely Prince had so great an Influence on her that it contributed likewise to her speedy Recovery His daily Attendance and tender Care gave her more Relief than all the Remedies which  the Surgeons apply'd to her Wounds and it may be said that as Love was the Author of the Pains and Disasters of these constant Lovers he was also their Physician and Comfort No Satisfaction cou'd be equal to theirs not is it possible to conceive the endearing Expressions they mutually exchang'd during their Illness  By this time it was known thro' the means of  Inea  that  Leonida  was Daughter to  Don John  of  Velasco  and  Zulema  having mention'd  Casilda  's Name she also inform'd the Court of her being of the Family of the  Benavidez's  and related to them the whole Story as she had heard it from  Leonida  As to the Prince of  Carency  's Name it was not long kept a Secret  Celima  told the King of  Granada  who he was which added so much to the Esteem he had already acquir'd thro' his personal Merit that he receiv'd all possible Marks of Honour from the King who went often to see him after this unhappy Adventure and endeavouring to console the Prince amongst other obliging Expressions he told him he restor'd him to his Liberty for which he desired no other Ransom than his Friendship and that had he known sooner of his being of the House of  Bourbon  he wou'd have shewn him all the Distinction that was due to so illustrious a Family  The Prince who now saw  Leonida  out of Danger was very willing to retrieve his Liberty  at any rate He readily accepted of the King of  Granada  's generous Offer and return'd him Thanks for that and the many other Favours he had confer'd on him since the time he was taken Prisoner  Celima  notwithstanding  Leonida  was her Rival extremely pity'd her and order'd that all the Attendance imaginable shou'd be given her She also visited the Prince who laying aside the Respect due to her Rank receiv'd her with so much Indifferency that she resolv'd never more to speak to him of his Unknown of  Nicopolis  The mean while the King of  Granada  who was desirous to compleat the Prince of  Carency  's good Fortune and had a Design at the same time to oblige the  Spaniards  thought on means to procure  Leonida  her Liberty he therefore address'd himself to the Queen of  Fez  offering her whatever Sum she wou'd please to demand for the Ransom of that young Lady But  Celima  whose Greatness of Spirit was equal to her Passion resolv'd no Sovereign shou'd surpass her in Generosity the Prince of  Carency  being a Christian and in Love with her Slave was enough to make her determine never to think of him more She told the King of  Granada  that far from requiring any Ransom for  Leonida  she desired he wou'd accept and dispose of her as he thought fit and that not only  Leonida  but all the rest of her Slaves were at his Command if agreeable to him The King heard with Pleasure  Celima  's Answer and in his Turn gallantly  presented  Leonida  to the Prince of  Carency  who receiv'd her with inexpressible Marks of Joy and Gratitude but cou'd not find Words to make a Retribution suitable to the Present  The chief and only Care of these happy Lovers consisted now in giving each other daily Proofs of their tender Affection Their long and cruel Disappointments made their Felicity the greater and tho' they were not as yet Perfectly recover'd they were proposing Means to leave  Granada  in order to perform the Promise which their Parents had made for them in their infant Years The Prince wrote to  Don John  of  Velasco  at  VillaReal  acquainting him with the Particulars of his and  Leonida  's Fortune and withal that he hop'd soon to be the happiest of Mankind  Mula  seeing his Master's Designs were render'd impracticable through this Adventure between the Prince of  Carency  and  Leonida  went back to  Sallee  and gave  Abelhamar  an Account of what had pass'd which News so cruelly affected him that the Loss of his Mistress had like to have made him act his own Death but as an Evincement of the Greatness of his Passion he took a Resolution proportionable to it for having renounc'd to the Crown of  Fez  he retired to a Castle on the Seaside where he consecrated the Remainder of his Life to the dear Memory of his  Felicia Celima  soon receiv'd Advice of this unexpected Change and as  Mahomet  was extremely sollicitous to serve her in so favourable a  Conjuncture he intreated the King of  Granada  his Father to give him a Fleet and some Forces in order to reinstate the Queen of  Fez  which being granted he took the Command entirely upon himself and convoy'd her to  Sallee  where far from meeting with any Opposition she found all Things in a perfect Tranquility By this time her Mind was more at Ease for having consider'd that she cou'd no longer hope to receive an obliging return to the Passion she had for the Prince of  Carency  she thought nothing wou'd sooner effect it's Cure than approving  Mahomet  's Vows therefore being of too haughty a Temper to bear with the Disdain of the one and Gratitude pleading in behalf of the other she at once resolv'd to give her Hand and all her Affection to  Mahomet  who by this Alliance saw his Love and Ambition satisfy'd  Celima  before she parted from  Granada  restor'd  Inea  to her Liberty and  Don Ramire  took her with him to  Toledo  where these two Lovers by a happy Union receiv'd the Reward of their Constancy  What I have farther to add relating to the Prince of  Carency  and  Leonida  is that as soon as they were in a Condition to set out on their Journey they took leave of the King of  Granada  who made them considerable Presents and order'd several Noblemen with a strong Detachment of his Guards to conduct them as far as the Frontiers of  Spain  whence they proceeded to  Villa Real  where they were receiv'd  with a Satisfaction equal to the Occasion Their long Sufferings intitled them to such Blessings as hardly any who wore the Chains of Love cou'd expect  Leonida  in whom so many Perfections were assembled was too great a Prize for an indifferent Heroe and the Prince of  Carency  whose Accomplishments render'd him one of the finest Gentlemen of his time might justly claim a Place in her Affection In short where so much Virtue and Merit was united Love must be triumphant Then let us leave the Prince and  Leonida  to the bounteous Care of  Hymen  whose soft Endearments cou'd only recompence their past Misfortunes and crown their Days with true Felicity  FINIS
