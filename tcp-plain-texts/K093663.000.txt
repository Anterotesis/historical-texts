 AN ACCURATE AND DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE OF THE SEVERAL PAINTINGS IN THE KING OF SPAIN's PALACE AT MADRID WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF THE PICTURES IN THE BUENRETIRO  By RICHARD CUMBERLAND Author of The Anecdotes of Eminent Painters in Spain  LONDON Printed for C DILLY in the Poultry AND J WALTER CharingCross MDCCLXXXVII  ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER  THIS Catalogue was made at my request by the Gentleman who has the superintendance of the Royal Collection in the Palace at Madrid and by his favour transmitted to me after my return out of Spain but too late to be inserted in my  Anecdotes of Spanish Painters  There can be no doubt therefore of its being accurate and I have accordingly so stated it in the title of this publication If the  descriptive  part had been executed by  the same hand I might have safely re∣commended this performance even to  Professors  of the Art I must now ad∣dress it to the  Lovers  only and sub∣mit my weak attempt with all its errors to the candour of the Public  CATALOGUE OF PAINTINGS IN THE NEW PALACE  FRESCOS  Great StairCase by D Cor∣rado Giaciunto  THE composition of this bril∣liant ceiling represents the rising of the Sun Apollo sur∣rounded by various allegorical fi∣gures and emblems gives life and motion to the Elements Spain as a matron habited in an imperial  mantle with several attributes and insignia proper to her character The colouring drawing and design very masterly  The staircase itself is a very magnificent work projected and executed by the celebrated  Sabatini  a Neapolitan Architect to His Ca∣tholic Majesty  Great GuardChamber by D Juan Bautista Tiepolo  Vulcan forging the armour of Aeneas at the request of Venus Mars in a triumphal character su∣perintending and protecting the work Various figures emblema∣tic of the Provinces Religion Va∣lour Victories and Productions of Spain  BallRoom by Corrado  In the center of this ceiling Re∣ligion is seated and the Church triumphant enthroned amidst the clouds to which Spain is offering gifts and incense in an attitude of adoration The nations subject to her empire are introduced with their respective emblems In the four corners are the Elements in medallic compartments Over one of the entrances there is a group of various figures with Boys em∣ployed in placing crowns of palm upon the principal characters Over another entrance Hercules is de∣scribed in the act of pulling down his pillars at the command of Nep∣tune who in his chariot passes the  Streights making his way through the barrier of antient navigation This is a very brilliant design rich and glowing in colour and execu∣tion and producing a very superb and striking effect  King's AntiChamber by Tie∣polo  The Monarchy of Spain as a majestic Matron in an imperial mantle with a Lion at her side An attendant figure in the act of placing a crown on her head Apollo with his lyre and the Muses form a separate group Castile in the character of a female with her proper attributes Hercules break∣ing down his pillars for the purpose of laying open the barrier of Africa  Sacrifices and Oblations repre∣sented in four medallic compart∣ments and addressed to the Deities who appear in the principal com∣position  Grand Saloon by the same Master  The painter has here personified the various characters of the Spa∣nish monarchy The figures are emblematic of Power Religion Wealth Plenty Victory c c The provinces of Spain are disposed over the cornice with their proper attributes The medals in the an∣gles are by the same master but the Boys that support them and the naked RiverGods as likewise the gilt compartments where the Ele∣ments  are represented are by the hand of  Robert Mitchell  This ceil∣ing and all the embellishments are profusely rich and splendid  Tiepolo  was a student of the Ve∣netian school and died at Madrid in the king's service on the th of March  King's DiningRoom by A R Mengs  The Apotheosis of Trajan  The deified Hero is seated on a throne of resplendent glory The virtues and attributes of a perfect monarch surround his throne A chaplet of laurel is supported in the air by five imaginary beings under which the artist has contrived to deli∣neate the victories of this imperial  Spaniard The temple of Immor∣tality appears in view and the choir of Muses are seen in the act of ce∣lebrating his glories Other alle∣gorical figures are interspersed in the composition with extraordinary judgment and contrivance  King's SupperRoom by the same  The Apotheosis of Hercules  He is conducted by Mercury to Jupi∣ter who invests him with the crown of immortality as a reward for his labours and conquests A group of Deities assist in the ceremony the distinguishing characteristics of the several Deities male and fe∣male are marked with great taste and much classical precision The  artist has given proof of his pro∣found study and experience in the antique The colouring perspec∣tive and general disposition of these two ceilings are inimitable There is no crowd flutter or deficiency in the whole or part the several groups conspire and harmonize in the most perfect and beautiful man∣ner the eye is not distracted by any predominance of detached parts but receives the whole magnificent composition as one compleat pic∣ture at a glance  These Frescos especially the Apotheosis of Trajan are as I conceive far superior to his Paint∣ings in oil and in this province of his art Mengs appears a very ca∣pital master I have never seen any  thing equal to them and so admi∣rable they appeared to me upon re∣peated visits that I must believe there are few productions in art which can better gratify the curio∣sity of a traveller One thing is clear that  Mengs  's colouring in fresco is totally of another cast from what he practised upon can∣vass  King's RetiringRoom by Tiepolo  Juno in her car with her proper attributes c  Queen's first AntiChamber by Luis Velasquez  The four Cardinal Virtues with several allegorical accompaniments  This painter must not be confound∣ed with the famous  Diego Velas∣quez  Queen's second AntiChamber by Antonio Velasquez  The subject nearly corresponds with the above and the artist has treated it pretty much in the same manner Both are respectable per∣formances  Antonio  was the bro∣ther of  Luis Velasquez  Queen's DiningRoom by Francisco Bayeu  The Conquest of Grenada  PresenceChamber by Ant Velasquez  Christopher Columbus in the act  of offering the newdiscovered World to the Catholic Sovereigns The four compartments in the an∣gles represent the provinces of Mexico Peru Chili and the Phi∣lippines  State BedChamber by Mengs  Another beautiful composition of this master representing Aurora going forth in her car drawn by horses All the emblems of Morn∣ing are exquisitely conceived The breaking forth of Light which is personified the accompaniment of the Hours the group of Night and her attendant emblems in the rear of the procession and all the cor∣respondent embellishments in high  relief are finely executed In these are represented the four Seasons of the year and the Elements  Prince of Asturias's Chamber by Tiepolo  The Conquest of Vellocino  Prince's DiningRoom by the same  Hercules in a car drawn by Centaurs The Muses and Graces celebrate his victories  Prince's Saloon by Domingo Tiepolo  Diana in the chace  Domingo  was the brother of  Juan Bautista Tiepolo  Prince's DressingRoom by Mariano Maella  The Choice of Hercules  Maella  was a disciple of  Mengs  and is now in the service of the King as Royal Artist He has made several portraits of the royal family I have seen some good original compositions of this mas∣ter and several copies from  Mengs  and the elder painters of great me∣rit and truth I am convinced he is a man of talents and candour and could refer to a striking in∣stance of his honour and integrity I would recommend it to any ar∣tist or lover of art who shall visit Madrid to introduce himself to the acquaintance of  Maella  from whose  courtesy I am persuaded he will receive all possible good offices and assistance  Princess of Asturias's AntiChamber by Gonzalez  The Arts  Princess's PresenceChamber by Bayeu  The Fall of the Giants  Princess's Cabinet by Maella  Juno solicits Aeolus for the Winds  Princess's Drawing Room by Bayeu  The Deification of Hercules The Virtues and Sciences attend  Infant Don Gabriel's DiningRoom by the same  Religion and the concomitant Virtues  Infant's DrawingRoom by Luis Velasquez  Allegorical composition relative to the kingdom of Spain  Infant's Cabinet by Domingo Tiepolo  A group of Birds with great variety of composition and deli∣cately executed  PICTURES  King's AntiChamber  Titian  Two large pictures of Sisyphus and Prometheus in their torments the figures above hu∣man size They were painted by this master in Spain and are fi∣gures of great force colouring and expression The manner of treat∣ing the Prometheus much resembles that of a celebrated picture on the same subject at Kimbolton Castle As the noble owner has no deter∣mined tradition of its author I shall hazard a conjecture that it  was painted by  Rubens  upon the idea of this figure of  Titian  's after that artist had visited Spain  Titian  Four halflength pour∣traits of Women not in his bright∣est manner  Titian  Four pourtraits of Men seemingly of the same period one of which is a pourtrait of the great artist himself in his advanced age a grand and venerable piece  Titian  A pourtrait of a Boy full length Correct and beautiful nature  Titian  Two fancy composi∣tions companions the figures half length One two Bacchants the other a Venus admiring herself in a  Mirror which Cupid holds up to her face With one of her hands she presses her bosom which is un∣covered and the action is delicately expressed These pictures hang level with the eye on each side of a door fronting the great entrance the effect is remarkably striking the relief bold and the colouring nature itself but perhaps the exe∣cution has not that finished delica∣cy which many of his earlier com∣positions have The characters both of one and the other are cer∣tainly of a wanton cast the per∣son halfuncovered halfconcealed with such a studied negligence of dress and so much playfulness of expression and attitude that the draperies seem introduced sor no  other purpose but to attract the at∣tention more strongly to the charms they do not serve to hide  Titian  Venus presents a cup to a Nymph Two Satyrs in the back ground with baskets of fruit This like the former is the  Venus lasciva  The contrast of hues between the prominent figure and the Satyrs in shades is managed with masterly address  All who are conversant in the works of this master will better conceive the striking effect of these three compositions than any de∣scription of mine can convey In whatever collection they hung they would certainly be very dangerous neighbours to most other colourists who came in contact with them  Titian  Adam and Eve in Pa∣radise the size of life a very ca∣pital picture upon a large canvass both figures of consummate beauty and of a sublime and chaste charac∣ter their attitudes simple natural without any trace of the Academy in their disposition The carna∣tions are not florid and the whole hue of the piece rather duskier than is usual with this master The background presents a noble land∣scape the scenery finely character∣ed and in beautiful harmony  Rubens  A copy of the above on a cloth of the same size this copy hangs between the windows in an unfavourable light and op∣posite to the original It is a mas∣terpiece of colouring and though  it has missed the delicacy of the model I am inclined to think it has surpassed it in force and effect It is evident that Rubens has put his whole strength to the work and as his efforts have been decidedly ad∣dressed to the colouring his figures have a broader nakedness if I may so express it than they have in the original whereas there is a purity in Titian's nakedness which is in character with the subject and fully corresponds with the most refined conceptions of human nature in it's primitive state of innocence and beauty When we contemplate Titian's Adam and Eve we are convinced they never wore cloaths turn to the copy and the same per∣sons appear to have laid theirs  aside and exposed themselves to shame for the credit of the painter  Tintoret  Two noble composi∣tions from sacred history compa∣nions The one a Judith with the head of Holofernes the other a Martyrdom of Saint Ursula and her companions The characters in both are of great grandeur finely conceived and executed with pecu∣liar brilliancy and spirit  Paul Veronese  Two charming pictures and the subjects beautiful One a Venus and a Sleeping Ado∣nis the other Cephalus and Pro∣cris both natural size  Juan Labrador  Two flowerpieces of the best master Spain ever  produced in this stile of painting These pieces are held in high es∣teem and though in company with works of a superior cast will attract the admiration of the be∣holder It has never been my chance to meet with any paintings of the like sort which I have thought comparable to these of  La∣brador  He died at Madrid in at a very advanced age See  Anecdotes vol i p    Pedro Orrente  A Nativity a capital composition This picture was removed from the chapel  de los Reyes nuevos  belonging to the ca∣thedral of Toledo Orrente was a familiar of the Inquisition and died in very old He was a dis∣ciple of Bassan and greatly sa∣voured  and employed by the mi∣nister Olivares  "He coloured in the stile of his master but in his choice of nature did not imitate his vulgarity of taste in correct∣ness of drawing he has rarely been exceeded He was buried at Toledo where he died and is deservedly to be numbered amongst the most eminent Spa∣niards of his profession"    See  Anecdotes vol i p  Bassan  Nine pictures of this master viz  Adam  naming the brute crea∣tion  Noah  introducing them into the Ark its companion both charm∣ing pictures  Two upon scripture subjects  Four of rural and domestic scenes  One very beautiful of  Orpheus  harping to the beasts  These pictures have been drawn from the great collection of  Bassans  in the  Buen Retiro  but it does not appear to have been a very ju∣dicious selection for they have certainly left many there of a supe∣rior merit to these particularly some upon historical subjects in a great stile and which are probably the most capital of their master any where to be met with  King's DiningRoom  Velasquez  Five magnificent pourtraits by this greatest of all the Spanish masters adorn this stately  chamber It is altogether one of the most striking spectacles that can meet the eye few scenes are to be found that can better repay the curiosity of a traveller and a stran∣ger to the works of this great paint∣er The magnitude of these ob∣jects the force and vigour of their colouring the proud character they are displayed in the profuse splen∣dor of the draperies and more than all the stately horses on which they are mounted dressed out with such redundancy of embel∣lishment conspire to produce an astonishing effect of these pour∣traits four are of royal person∣ages  viz  Philip III and IV and their re∣spective Queens  The last and best is the pourtrait of the  Conde Duque de Olivares  minister of Spain and patron of the artist There are etchings of all these pourtraits copies of which I brought over from Spain  Rubens  Philip the Third on horseback A very noble pour∣trait  Vanlo  Philip the Fifth on horseback and Queen Isabella on foot The inferiority of this artist is rendered very conspicuous by the contrast of the capital pictures a∣bovementioned  Rubens  Four compositions of this master hang over the doors  viz  A Hercules resting from his la∣bours  The Judgment of Paris  Pluto in his car  Apollo in his course capital pieces  The sculptures in this and the antichamber above described are numerous and fine In the former there is a remarkable bust of Sene∣ca by Bernini and in this several of Roman emperors and empresses antique an infant Hercules sleep∣ing of exquisite workmanship c c  King's SupperRoom  Velasquez  The famous Familypiece of the  Infanta D  a  Margarita of Austria  afterwards empress of  Germany with various other per∣sons in different employments a large group The painter has intro∣duced two dwarfs and what adds greatly to its value he is repre∣sented in person in the act of paint∣ing the Infanta whose pourtrait ap∣pears upon the easel  "It is related of this picture that King Philip with his own hand painted the order of Santiago upon the dra∣pery of Velasquez's figure which order he was not till then possess∣ed of When Charles the Se∣cond of Spain shewed this pic∣ture to Luca Jordano he ex∣claimed with rapture and surprize Sen̄or  esta es la Theologia de la pintura  "  Anecdotes vol ii p  A copy of this famous picture upon a small scale was taken for the late Lord Grantham when he was ambassador in Spain and brought over by his Lordship to England It is to be hoped his successors in that station will follow his example and obtain copies or drawings of other capital pictures in that kingdom  Titian  Charles V in complete armour his lance in his hand his vizor up and himself mounted on a beautiful horse he is preparing to pass his troops over a river which is described in the scenery of the background of the size of life upon a very large canvass This picture sets all description at de∣fiance  at least all such description as I can attempt I cannot doubt its being the most capital pourtrait of the master and has been so es∣teemed by the best judges who have seen it there is reason to believe that Titian rated it as such him∣self  In the countenance of the mo∣narch we read his history or which perhaps is nearer to truth recol∣lecting his history we acknowlege the agreement of character in every line and in the reflection of his features we find the painter has re∣corded the annals of his life Ne∣ver was more expression of a mind committed to canvass A pensive dignity prevails traced with marks of pain and bodily decay He is  deep in thought his eyes gloomy and severe the lids heavy inflated and remarkably low over the eye∣balls the underlip projecting and the mouth characteristic of revenge and resolution He is advancing to give battle to the unfortunate Elec∣tor of Saxony and the Landgrave those opposers of his power and of his faith external objects have no share in his attention the whole man is engrossed by the deepest meditation His lance is poised pa∣rallel with the ground and ranges along the side of his horse with the point advanced beyond its breast the action of the animal harmonizes with the character of his rider slowly and composedly stepping forward the head low  and submitted and the eye expres∣sive of the most resigned obedience to his imperial master All is calm and still in the scene no flutter or disturbance in the objects the co∣louring drawing and perspective are the life itself the whole is such perfect nature that art seems extin∣guished by its own excellence  Titian  Philip II in armour his infant Son raised in his arms whom he is devoting to Fame which is represented as descending from the skies in the act of crown∣ing the newborn prince with a wreath of palm On a scroll are these words  Majora Tibi  The artist has put his name to this pic∣ture in the following words  Titianus Vecellius Eques Caesaris fecit  Vandyke  The Infant Don Fer∣dinand on horseback  Castiglione  Gladiators very fine and spirited This picture is doubt∣fully ascribed to Castiglione but my catalogue gives it to him with∣out any remark  Cavallero Maximo  Gladiators its companionThese two pictures hang over the doors and have both great merit  Titian  Venus and Adonis and Europa on the Bull its companionThese also hang over the doors and are beautiful pic∣tures Every spectator must regret that they are not brought down  nearer to the eye but these and many other instances occur of over∣sights in the hanging of this collec∣tion which I am informed was ar∣ranged by Mengs and as it should seem with some partiality to his own performances  King's DressingRoom  Velasquez  A group of Spaniards carousing These rustic Bacchana∣lians are evidently sketched from nature Bacchus is introduced sit∣ting on a cask putting a garland on the head of a Peasant who kneels at his feet On his left hand is a group of five other rustics one of which holds a goblet of wine ano∣ther a can and another has a lea∣ther bag slung across his shoulder  their faces are grotesque and savage and strongly marked with the Cas∣tilian cast of features On the right hand of Bacchus are two fi∣gures attendant upon him one of these is naked and sits at his back leaning on one elbow and in the other hand holding a narrowbot∣tomed drinking glass with wide lips the other is in strong shade in the foreground his face turned from the spectator in a crouching attitude embracing a large earthen amphora which stands on the ground both these figures are crowned with wreaths of vine and the God who has a mantle loosely thrown over his waist has his whole head covered with a large cluster of broad vine leaves  in a grand and picturesque stile His countenance is strongly charac∣tered in the Moorish or Andalusian cast with a broad nose full lips wide mouth and black sparkling eyes The figures are of the size of life A very capital compo∣sition  Velasquez  A composition on the subject of Mercury and Argos Its companion  Velasquez  The Forge of Vul∣can The Cyclops are at work and Apollo is introduced who is disclosing to Vulcan the intrigues of Venus with Mars The painter has here chosen a subject which enables him to display his art in its sullest extent and he has per∣sormed  it with consummate address The effect of light and shade from the reflection of the forge and the sparks which fly from their ham∣mers produce a striking effect The athletic forms and dusky hues of the Cyclops are artfully contrast∣ed with the beautiful proportions and fine tints of Apollo's person The character of Vulcan is finely conceived the story well told and the group disposed with great judgment  Velasquez  The celebrated pic∣ture of the Tapestryworkers or women weaving tapestry a won∣derful representation of nature in the best stile of the master and of his clearest colouring  Velasquez  The famous Aqua∣dor or Waterbearer of Seville One of his earliest productions See  Anecdotes vol ii p    Velasquez  Two pourtraits of Dwarfs sitting on the ground These Dwarfs belonged to Philip IV One has a large volume be∣fore him and is turning over the leaves by his side are pen and ink and a commonplace book A correct resemblance of deformed nature  Velasquez  A fulllength pour∣trait of an Old Man with papers in his hand said to be the Alcalde  Ronquillo  Velasquez  Two fulllength  pourtraits of dignified characters Very fine  These compleat the number of ten pictures by this master here brought together and though there may be superior pictures of Velas∣quez in this palace in the Escorial and particularly the Dead Christ on the Cross in the monastery of San Placido yet there can no where be seen such a collection of his works under one view and whatever lover of the art shall enter this room I am persuaded he will not depart from it without a very high respect for this illustrious Spaniard  Murillo  Two large and fine compositions on scriptural subjects  viz  The Annunciation and  The Nativity  Murillo  Two small ditto very delicately touched and finely co∣loured  viz  The Espousals of Ma∣ry the Mother of Christ and  An Infant Jesus sleeping  Murillo  A Jesus with St John the Baptist in his last and best manner An exquisite piece mid∣dle sized  Murillo  A Holy Family large size  Murillo  A Virgin halflength with the Infant Jesus entire stand∣ing  Lanfranc  An Assumption with a Glory of Angels small size very beautiful Ponz in his Di∣rectory calls this a Guido  Vandyke  Two pourtraits of La∣dies of the Austrian house in the religious habit of the Royal Carmel∣itish convent One of them appears to be the Infanta Don̄a Margarita Both halflengths  Titian  Three halflength pour∣traits of noble persons  Spagnolet  Saint John  Saint Bartholomew  Mary Magdalene and  Mary of Egypt  Exquisite samples of a master whose merit cannot be fully known but to those who have seen his works in his native country  Luca Jordano  The Flight into Egypt  Abraham sacrificing his Son its companion  David Teniers  Four landscapes with a great variety of figures ex∣cellent  There is also a picture by a master unknown in the Flemish stile a composition of great labour and minuteness after the manner of Brughel representing a cabinet surnished with a variety of pictures statues flowers and articles of dif∣ferent sorts highly finished  Mengs  A Nativity the figures of the size of life  This is his celebrated picture which the king has covered with a magnificent plate of glass It was painted at Rome and sent from  thence to Madrid In the person of one of the Shepherds the artist has introduced his own pourtrait The whole is laboured with amaz∣ing care and study and very ten∣derly coloured His miniatureedu∣cation is conspicuous in this per∣formance and the Infant is remark∣ably diminutive and delicate The subject perhaps precludes origina∣lity and it does not seem to be attempted It is scarce necessary to add that this picture is a great courtfavourite all the works of  Mengs  are generally extolled in Spain and this the most I have observed however that the opi∣nions of mankind at large with re∣gard to his rank in the list of artists run much into opposite extremes  and this is generally the fate which eminent men experience in the judgment of their contemporaries This does not seem to proceed from any want of present capacity to as∣certain the degrees of merit in men before Time has pronounced upon them with more authority but is rather owing to the good and evil passions of mankind to their lik∣ings and their antipathies to an affectation of singularity and a vanity to be thought a leader in taste and a discoverer of latent merit surprised by these motives into sudden applause we commit ourselves to it with a warmth which though it frequently cools we dare not disavow and thus become par∣ties  in the reputation we are pledg∣ed to support  Mengs  An Incarnation its companion This also was painted in Rome and transmitted from thence  King's Closet  Teniers  Twentyfour pictures of this muchadmired master small in size but of admirable execution hang in this room and form of themselves a most valuable collec∣tion  Two of these are satirical and lu∣dicrous allegories on the subject of the Arts  Two others are much in the same  stile and represent the temptations of Saint Anthony  The rest are landscapes of vari∣ous sorts with figures and cattle Of these I shall not offer any de∣scription which scenes of this sort do not admit of like pictures upon historical subjects The eye of the artist will dwell upon them with de∣light If we may suppose for a mo∣ment that this whole magnificent collection was at sale perhaps these pictures of Teniers would be a∣mongst the very first that modern virtuosi would reach at  Wouvermans  An exquisite picce The landscape a most beautiful country with men and women dogs and horses and all the concomitants  of a rural wake and merrymak∣ing  Segers  A grand Flowerpiece  Brughel  Eight beautiful pic∣tures Three of these are Flowerpieces the other five small fabu∣lous compositions with nymphs adorned with garlands of flowers and various embellishments rich and luxuriantly coloured The whole a most captivating collection of a favourite master  In this closet is a painted Cabi∣net which would demand longer examination than I could devote to it it is by a Flemish hand but the master's name has escap∣ed me and my manuscript cata∣logue does not mention it It  is esteemed a masterpiece in its kind  PassageRoom to the King's BedChamber  Alonzo Cano  A Dead Christ supported by an Angel  This noble Spaniard may be styled the Michael Angelo of Spain for he was architect statuary and paint∣er and excelled in each For his life which is curious  See Anecdotes vol  ii  p  c  Murillo  Head of an Ecce Homo  D  o  of a Madona both small pieces very fine  A single figure of the tutelar Saint James to the knees excel∣lent  in his best and brightest man∣ner  Spagnolet  Saint Francis de Asis halflength  Saint Geronimo a companion  Amongst all the works of this artist whether here or in the Esco∣rial I have not met one which did not engage my admiration and I was surprised to find him as great a master of grace and beauty as he is of effect  Cavallero Maximo  A Magda∣lene halflength  Mengs  A Holy Family large size  Baroccio  A Last Supper small and of exquisite delicacy  Leonardo da Vinci  Herodias with the head of John the Baptist halflength small size very fine but its originality doubtful  Luca Jordano  A Madona halflength with the Child sleep∣ing Saint John kissing his feet and Saint Joseph in the back∣ground An oval painted in the manner of Raphael a charming piece A very curious sample of the imitative powers of this inge∣nious painter  Joseph de Arpino  The Martyr∣dom of Saint Ines a glory with Saints and the Blessed Virgin in the clouds Clement VIII made this painter a knight of Christ and Louis XIII of France gave him  the order of Saint Michael He died at Rome in aged eighty years  This chamber being only a pas∣sageroom between the dressingroom and bedchamber is lighted only from the glass doors and very unfavourable to the excellent pic∣tures it contains  King's BedChamber  Mengs  The king has here strongly marked his predilection for Mengs by admitting none but his paintings to hang in this cham∣ber These consist of six composi∣tions of the size of life and two small ones  viz  A Descent from the Cross  both the Marys and Saint John are re∣presented  The air and expression of the head of Saint John very ca∣pital but closely copied from the Elder Mary in a painting of  Van∣dyke  's on the same subject which was long in Mengs's hands and now in my possession In my opi∣nion this composition is far the best of all his paintings in oil that are in this palace  The Eternal Father  enthroned amongst the Angels in heaven This hangs over the picture abovementioned  Christ praying in the Garden  Christ appearing to Mary Magda∣len  Christ falling under the Cross  Christ scourged  These four hang over the doors  Two small pictures one a Saint John the other a Magdalen highly finished and well coloured Of the pictures over the doors I cannot speak in commendation  King's RetiringRoom  Vandyke  Pourtrait of a woman small size  Guido  An Ecce Homo a head very fine  Velasquez  A Boy fulllength with a dog  Peasant Boys eating and drink∣ing of the size of life halflength In the background a clear and beautiful landscape  Paul Veronese  Two small pour∣traits  Titian  Two small pourtraits  Poussin  An old Bacchanal ini∣mitable A landscape in the background  Brughel  A most beautiful col∣lection of landscapes with historical figures eight in number amongst these there is a Venus and Vulcan very fineThe ArtsA Saint John the Baptist preaching ca∣pitalThe Baths of Diana the scenery most charming  Teniers  Twenty small compo∣sitions of this master which with the others above mentioned make this cabinet inestimable  Berbedel  A small picture of a Dead Christ very fine  Queen's first Antichamber  Lanfranc  A large and capital composition representing a Royal Funeral supposed to be that of A∣lexander whose body is laid out in state and in front a fight of Gladia∣tors of the size of life  Lanfranc  The Election of a Successor in which is introduced another combat of Gladiators Both noble performances in the best stile of the Master  Lanfranc died at Rome in aged years  Guido  Love and Avarice per∣sonified in the characters of two Boys very beautiful  Poussin  A very celebrated com∣position representing a grand Bac∣chanalian Sacrifice priestesses per∣forming rites at the altars of Bac∣chus and Priapus The landscape undescribably rich and fine a largesized picture  What a noble subject had this been for our late incomparable Woollet What a study for Ar∣tists a picture formed to captivate all beholders  Jordaens  Two allegorical Paint∣ings over the doors  viz  Wantonness in the character of a Fawn  Plenty described by sundry fe∣male figures bearing fruits and flowers very like Rubens  Titian  Philip the Third

Story of Cephalus and Procris  Rubens  A large and capital composition on the subject of Or∣pheus harping to the Brutes  This is truly an inestimable pic∣ture giving such a display of co∣louring as can hardly be conceiv∣ed It was painted by him in Spain in his best age and manner  Flemish Painter unknown  Three landscapes and one large d  o    Queen's Second Antichamber  Lanfranc  Julius Caesar haran∣guing his Soldiers large size This picture does honour to the school of the Caraccis  French School  Painter unknown Two large compositions a public entry as it should seem of some ambassador  Luca Jordano  Esau selling his birthright to Jacob  Bathsheba in the bath  Carlo Maratti  Two halflengths of women with baskets of flowers very beautiful  Cavallero Maximo  A sacrifice for Bacchus  Andrea Vasari  The Life of St Catherine in four compositions  A Magdalen  Spagnolet  A Saint Barthole∣mew halflength horribly fine  Corrado  Two original Sketches of Frescos  Two large Landscapes over the doors of great merit  Brughel  Two most charming Flowerpieces  Jordaens  A capital composi∣tion of Fruits and Flowers with a Female Figure to the knees  Queen's Dining Room  Luca Jordano  The Martyr∣dom of St Lawrence large size four compositions from the History of the Blessed Virgin  A Saint Peter  A Mary Magdalen  A Transfiguration  A Saint Michael being the ori∣ginal design for the great alterpiece in the King's chapel  A Battlepiece  Vasari  Two small compositions from the Story of Saint Cay∣etan  Corrado  Three original Sketch∣es of Frescos  Teniers  An Armoury very fine  Teniers  A very curious and ca∣pital picture in which the Artist has drawn himself sitting in his paintingroom where is a grand collection of statues pictures and designs which without doubt is a pourtrait in all particulars  Of all the pictures of Teniers I have ever seen this I think the most to be coveted and admired Another excellent subject for an engraving  Brughels  Four fine Sea Pieces  Two Landscapes  One d  o  of a large size  Three small Flowerpieces a very valuable collection  Queen's Great Sa  Titian  A fulllength pourtrait of the Emperor Charles V on foot with a large mastiff painted at Bo∣logna before Titian entered into his service and as he was on his way to Rome To this pourtrait Titian applied his utmost art and his success paved the way to the favour in which he was ever after held by the Emperor  Zelma  a Spanish Artist of great merit has engraved this pourtrait very finely It is bound up with the new publication of  Sepulveda  's Works in which is contained the History of Charles V written in pure Latin with other matters historical and miscellaneous of a  very curious nature This work is comprised in four quarto volumes and was published whilst I was in Spain  Titian  Philip the Second of Spain a capital pourtrait  Pourtrait of a man halflength  D  o  of a woman d  o    Rubens  The Rape of Proser∣pine a capital composition  A Garden Scene in which he

priest is  mounted on a horse which is led by a count of Augsberg  This is one of the many ca∣pital pictures of this master to be found in Spain which have con∣spired to impress me with the high∣est veneration for his talents Per∣haps I have already tired the reader with too many attempts at describ∣ing objects which interested my feelings upon the contemplation of them and therefore altho' few occasions can offer which might better warrant the endeavour I shall venture upon nothing more than to recommend it to the tra∣veller who shall visit this collec∣tion if he condescends to take this Directory in his hand to stop at this picture and if he bestows his  attention upon it I am persuaded he will not withhold his admi∣ration  Velasquez  Four capital pour∣traits fulllength  viz  Margaret of Austria  Philip the Second  Philip the Third of Spain  An African commander suppos∣ed to be the famous Barbarossa  Luca Jordano  Four great His∣torical Pieces on the subject of Solomon  Three sabulous compositions  viz  Pluto in his car Jupiter and a Daedalus  Jordaens  Still Life Fruits and various Viands  Corrado  Sketches of emblema∣tic Figures Justice Peace c  Flemish  Two large and fine Landscapes  Queen's BedChamber  Vandyke  Christ betrayed and seized by Judas and his followers a nightpiece  Mengs  in his Observations upon the Royal Collection particularizes this picture and says it is painted with great taste and coloured to as great a perfection as the scene which is by night will admit of Undoubtedly it merits the warmest admiration and is a very capital picture of the master  Luca Jordano  Four Histories from the Life of St Anthony  Two from that of Solomon  Two of the Blessed Virgin  Two of St Nicholas de Bari and St Francis Xavier  Two others of the Incarnation  Pedro Orrente  Orpheus harp∣ing to the Brute Creation very fine  Of the School of Guido  Christ laid in the Sepulchre  Vasari  The four Cardinal Vir∣tues  St Rosalia supported by An∣gels

Asturias's Saloon  Luca Jordano  Four small Pic∣tures two of which are Battle∣pieces one a Rape of the Sabines and the other a Curtius leaping the gulph  A Seneca expiring in the bath dictating to his disciples in his last moments  I believe the picture at Burleigh is a  facsimile  of this but I did not carry it sufficiently in mind to be sure of the assertion  Velasquez  St Anthony convers∣ing in the Desart with St Paul the Hermit  A celebrated figure of the God Mars both capital  Spaniolet  Esau selling his Birth∣right finely treated with great ef∣fect of light and shade and strong expression

Rubens  Mercury and Argos  Satyrs  School of Rubens  A Triumph in which is introduced a combat of Gladiators male and female  Two compositions upon the Al∣legories of the Senses and Ele∣ments  Jordaens  A Pomona the sce∣nery very beautiful  Prince's DiningRoom  Velasquez  Vulcan at his Forge  The Prince of Spain mounted on a beautiful Spanish Jennet in full speed The spirit which the paint∣er has thrown into this pourtrait and the truth with which it is drawn and coloured render it a most admirable piece of art I have an etching from this pour∣trait  Velasquez  A grand and cele∣brated piece of history upon a very large canvas representing the fa∣mous General Pescara receiving the keys of a Flemish citadel from the Governor of the place the groupe of Generals Soldiers Citi∣zens Horses c and the striking effect of the town and landscape in the background all in the most harmonious perspective have esta∣blished the fame of this noble pic∣ture in the opinion of judges as one of the first if not the very first production of the master  Mengs  says decidedly that it is the chef∣d'oeuvre of  Velasquez  and has pro∣nounced it to be faultless except in the circumstance of the soldiers' lances which he criticises as being  too long Surely this is a very trivial remark to fall from the pen of so great authority and trivial as it is there is great reason to doubt if it is founded in truth Af∣ter all if the painter has enlarged upon the actual height of Pescara's lances for the purpose of effect who would expect that any eminent critic after pronouncing the com∣position faultless in every noble part would seriously state this re∣mark as a single exception Let us therefore admit with  Mengs  that  Velasquez  has taken a wrong mea∣sure of Pescara's lances but at the same time let us take his word for the perfection of the picture in every other respect If any lover of the art who resorts to this col∣lection  should at the same time dis∣cover that there is one foot in the famous  Pasmo de Sicilia  more than can be accounted for I hope for his sake it will not abate the rap∣ture he would else receive in the contemplation of such unrivalled compositions  Velasquez  Philip the Second of Spain  Philip the Third both fulllength pourtraits by the same great master and both very fine  Two fulllength characters of Aesop one and the other of Mae∣nippus of the strongest expression and in a great stile Of these two I have etchings  Two halflength pourtraits one  of which is a very interesting and curious picture of the unfortunate Antonio Perez It hangs near the pourtrait of Philip the Second  A View of the Palace of the Par∣do in which he has introduced the persons of Philip IV and the Prin∣cess Margaret of Austria This compleats a list of ten paintings by  Velasquez  in this chamber few apartments can be more royally furnished  Pedro Mazo  A perspective View of the City of Saragossa with the course of the river Ebro and a group of figures a fine and ela∣borate piece  Titian  Six pourtraits four of men and two of women all halflengths  Titian  An Orpheus this pic∣ture is highly celebrated Of his best age and manner  Tintorett  Judith and Holofernes capital  Solimena  Six histories of Solo∣mon over the doors  Murillo  An Old Woman sell∣ing grapes  A Countryfellow selling wine both halflengths  These are reputed to be the most finished heads  Murillo  ever painted they are the nature itself coloured to a miracle  The Infant Don Gabriel has co∣pied them in sifted cloth with great truth and exactness and has hung  them in his lodge at the Escorial There are also good engravings of them taken in Spain of which I have copies  Antony Coypel  The Elders ac∣cusing Susanna  Spagnolet  A small copy from Raphael  Wouvermans

fi∣gures personating Peace and Plenty  Flemish  Still life Fish and sundry Viands  Prince's DressingRoom  Raphael  The celebrated pic∣ture called PASMO DE SICILIA purchased by Philip the Fourth of the Monks of Palermo and by him termed  La Joya  in preference to all others An annualrent of one thousand scudi was the price at which the king purchased it of the monks of our Lady dello Spasimo and hence it got the name of  Pasmo de Sicilia Vasari  and the cele∣brated canon of Valencia  Don Vi∣cente Victoria  and in late times  Mengs  have all written largely in testimony of its unrivalled excel∣lence and there seems a general  concurrence amongst the judges of the art to set it down as the masterpiece of Raphael In my second volume of the Anecdotes of Spanish Painters I have collected several cir∣cumstances relating to this famous picture and attempted a description of it which if the reader is disposed to refer to will be found in  vol ii from page    to    inclusive  Rubens The Adoration of the Magi  This picture like the  Last Supper  of  Titian  in the Refectory of the Escorial is the standard work of its master It was begun in Flanders enlarged retouched and finished during his embassy in Spain no∣thing that his art genius and in∣dustry  could effect is omitted In grandeur of design display of colour∣ing dignity of character in com∣position drawing perspective har∣mony it is a model of excellence Rubens in putting his last hand to it has inserted his own pourtrait amongst the groupe of the Magi the noblest signature that could be set upon his canvass  The figures are the size of life  Rubens  A Holy Family a groupe of Female Saints and Boys in vari∣ous employments The scenery and embellishments of this rich and noble composition are admirable  Vasari  Five historical pieces taken from the Story of Saint Caye∣tan companions  Murillo  A large Holy Family the Mother and Saviour to the knees  Spagnolet  A celebrated picture representing the Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew a masterpiece of ana∣tomical art and terrible expression  A Saint Benito and a Saint Ge∣ronimo both penitential characters finely designed and of the tenderest expression a striking contrast to the Saint Bartholomew  A Mary Magdalen a touching and most delicate design conceived and executed with all the grace of the Italian student and all the na∣ture of the Spanish master  The genius of Spagnolet like his fortune seems always to be engaged on subjects either of terror or of pity  he never draws but with a tragic pencil and so truly that he gives the nature itself upon his canvass In melancholy grace and penitential beauty he is equal to  Guercino  in anatomical science and muscular correctness he ranks with  Leonardo de Vinci  and in the sublime and terrible approaches to  Michael An∣gelo  The examples of his art which he has left in Spain if they were generally known would I am per∣suaded warrant what I now venture to say and for his life and misfor∣tunes which are very interesting I beg leave to refer once more to the  Anecdotes vol i page    Andrea Sacchi  A Nativity a large and capital composition  Mengs  A Nativity large size  Luca

of small size embracing the Child  Corregio  Christ praying in the Garden  A small picture but of inexpres∣sible beauty and magical effect of colouring It has been particularly celebrated by  Mengs  in his Remarks The figure of Christ receives its light from a Glory the scene is by night a reflected light from the Sa∣viour  strikes on the Angel who is attending for his consolation The manner in which this emanation is reflected and diffused through the piece to the extremities of the back∣ground and the exquisite gradations observed in its distribution are in the highest degree characteristic of the master  Mengs  remarks that Christ and the Ministering Angel are the only figures which meet the eye upon a first view a closer examina∣tion brings forward many other ob∣jects and much beautiful scenery This is truly observed for the Troop that come to seize our Saviour the Apostles standing aloof under the shade of Trees the Foliage of the Grove the Herbage of the Garden a Crown of Thorns a Cross fixt in the  earth and several other emblematic objects suitable to the action come by degrees into view and start up like visions created by the fancy of the spectator rather than by the pencil of the artist  Corregio  A Madona and Child with Saint Joseph at a distance  Mengs  observes that this may be called a sketch as it plainly appears that the attitude and action of the Mother and Child have undergone several alterations in point of dispo∣sition by a peculiar management of the middle imperceptible tints in this small yet inestimable paint∣ing there is produced a very won∣derful effect of size and grandeur from figures which do not measure  two inches  Mengs  pronounces that  Corregio  possest this art of treating lights and shades in the first degree  Velasquez  in the second to  Corregio  and  Rembrandt  next to  Velasquez  He adds that the Child in this sketch is a model of consummate excel∣lence not only from the incom∣parable management of the  Clearobscure  but also from the colour∣ing character drawing and divine grace Of the outline he speaks with rapture and remarks that  Corregio  in this most difficult branch of his art was never equalled by any but the great  Michael Angelo  and  Ra∣phael Urbin  Corregio  A Head of Saint John of a sweet character and beautifully treated  Leonardo de Vinci  A Madona and Child small size  A

size  Claudio Coello  Saint Fernando worshipping the Virgin who is seated on a Throne with the Infant Jesus in a rich and splendid Apartment a beautiful Landscape is discovered in the background A large and fine composition painted with great  expression and effect in the best manner of the master  This painter was a native of Spain out of which he never tra∣velled a disciple of Francisco Ricci and royal artist in the court of Philip IV His pictures are highly esteemed in Spain and I have met some admirers of them who do not scruple to prefer him to  Murillo Spagnolet  and even to  Velasquez  His masterpiece is the great picture in the sacristy of the Escorial upon which he expended seven years la∣bour Of this and many other anecdotes of his history I have given an account  vol ii page    c  Paul Veronese  Jesus disputing with the Doctors in the Temple This  I conceive to be a picture of great beauty majesty and effect the com∣position is full and finely disposed the characters sublime and majestic marked with striking discrimination and contrast The architecture is superb the colouring clear and of a most captivating brilliancy The character of Christ is divinely con∣ceived and of matchless beauty The picture is of large size and a most capital performance of the master  The Receiving Room  Rembrandt  Cleopatra receives the Cup of melted Pearl from the Hands of a Female Slave An in∣estimable picture in his finest stile large size  Spagnolet  A Combat of Gladi∣ators This picture is esteemed one of the very best of the master it is a study for an Academy The atti∣tudes of the Combatants the spirit of their characters and the great truth and correctness of drawing cannot be too much admired The subject was well chosen to display the science of the painter in the muscles and proportions of the hu∣man figure naked and in the strongest exertion of manly vigour  Murillo  A Judith with the Head of Holofernes a Female Servant with a Light halflength This is managed with great skill and effect it is a study from nature admirably executed  Titian  Two most capital com∣positions celebrated through Eu∣rope and justly recorded by  Mengs  as the most consummate models of beauty One represents a group of Boys and Cupids the other of Bac∣chanals companions  "The figures in each are of the third part of the natural size In the foreground of the group of Bacchanals there is a young Female Reveller sleep∣ing of which  Mengs  speaks in rap∣tures of admiration and concludes his remarks on this picture by ob∣serving that all the harmonious accompaniments of Sky variegat∣ed Ground with deep and tender shades of the Trees form such an assemblage of beautiful objects in nature perfectly imitated that he  does not think the world possesses a better picture in this stile The Boys and Cupids in the other piece are grouped with wonderful variety of attitudes they are en∣gaged in puerile sports under a Grove of Appletrees the fruit of which they have scattered on the ground and are playing with it in the most gay and natural manner It is equally excellent with its companion These pictures were formerly in the Ludovici palace at Rome and were a present to the king of Spain  Sandrart  re∣ports of this group of Cupids that it served for a study to  Do∣meniquino Poussin  and  Flameneco Albano  has taken part of it into a composition of his painting and  there are copies of both these com∣panions by  Rubens  in the palace Of these  Mengs  says that  they are like an elegant author translated into Dutch where the sentiments of the original may be guessed at but all the grace is vanished  "  Anecdotes vol i p  What subjects for an eminent engraver  Titian  Three pourtraits halflength one of a Man another of a Woman and a third of a Girl

by Murillo  Villa Vicenzi  A Scriptural Com∣position companion in size with the above in the stile of Murillo The name of this painter was Pedro Nu∣n̄ez a disciple of Mathias Preti commonly called El Cavellero Ca∣labrès He died at Seville in  Flemish  A beautiful group of Fruits and Flowers painter un∣known  Mazo  Philip IV with his Queen and Dames of Honour Mazo was a disciple of the famous Velasquez  I have now gone through the Ca∣talogue of this noble collection and as I have reason to think it is the only correct and entire account yet  published I hope it will be accept∣able to the curious reader Mengs's remarks only go to a few pictures and the account of them in the  Viage de Espan̄a  by  Don Antonio Ponz  is very far from perfect though it is a work otherwise replete with in∣teresting information and as a ge∣neral directory to travellers in Spain no book can be better contrived  If the lovers of the art are curi∣ous to analyze this account and se∣parate the respective works of the several great masters they will find it to be a vast collection which the Spanish monarchs Charles V Phi∣lip II III and IV amassed within the periods of their reigns And if we add to this the great collection in the Escorial that of the BuenRetiro  the many fine pictures which were burnt in the Pardo and some of the most capital which have been discarded in the present reign the amount will appear prodigious and I apprehend is not to be equalled by any other single collection in Europe  Of  Titian Velasquez Rubens Mu∣rillo  and  Spagnolet  I find above one hundred and forty pictures in this sin∣gle Catalogue fortythree of which are by the hand of  Titian  I must take the liberty notwithstanding to suggest that this collection would still allow of many draughts to be made and if these vacancies were filled up from the BuenRetiro only not to mention the Escorial it would be much more perfect  Some of  Luca Jordano  's pictures might well be spared  Corrado  's sketches the pourtraits of  Vanlo  and  Ynza  and some of  Mengs  's inferior performances would be well ex∣changed for a select number of  Bas∣san  's from the old Palace for a ca∣pital  Lucretia  by  Guido  which hangs there in obscurity and many others that might be named  It is also to be regretted that  Ve∣lasquez  's famous picture of Jacob re∣ceiving the bloody Coat of his Son Joseph and a very fine  Guercino  on the subject of Susanna and the El∣ders both which now hang in a wretched hole in the Escorial not appropriated to any sacred uses should not be removed from thence and added to the royal collection  Advantageous changes might also be made in the arrangement of the pictures for in the quarter belong∣ing to the Prince and Princess many capital pictures of  Raphael Corregio Leonardo de Vinci Julio Romano An∣drea Sacchi Andrea del Sarto  and others are very unfavourably hung the chamber in which the principal pieces are being a mean obscure room filled with lumber and not in the suite of great apartments The masters are classed in general with∣out much scientific attention to their stiles of colouring so that the florid pictures oftentimes browbeat the more tender and the cold laboured regularity of Mengs ill contrasts the warm and glowing canvasses of  Ti∣tian Rubens  and  Velasquez  But if  this remark holds good against the sorting of the pictures in this palace how much more to be lamented is the condition of the capital pictures in the Escorial where the inimitable  Perla  of  Raphael  the Holy Family of  Andrea del Sarto  and the famous  Tintorett  of Christ washing his Disciples' Feet hang aloft in dust and darkness over the presses that contain the Reliques in the Sacristy and are almost totally out of sight This must be painful to every lover of the art but to the English tra∣veller more than any who will na∣turally cast a look of pity and af∣fection towards these interesting ob∣jects once in the possession of an elegant and unhappy monarch who left them as monuments of his  taste to be alienated from his crown and nation by an unfeeling crew of fanatics as barbarous as they were bloody  It is to be regretted that so few engravings have been taken from the capital pictures in Spain I procured all that were to be had and the col∣lection is very small Two more may be soon expected by the hand of  Zelma  an eminent artist viz of the  Pasmo de Sicilia  and the  Perla  The  Nra  Sen̄ora del pez  has been en∣graved by Bartolozzi It were greatly to be wished that proper encourage∣ment should be given to our young artists of talents to take drawings of some of these pictures above de∣scribed in which I am confident they would meet every possible fa∣vour  and protection from the royal owner of the collection Several pictures might be pointed out in this Catalogue and elsewhere which would be admirable subjects and raise the credit of our artists already so high in estimation At the same time that I venture to recommend this undertaking I am not without some grounds to hope that it is in contemplation  I should here take notice that in the above Catalogue no account is taken of the pictures in the apart∣ments of the Infants Don Gabriel Don Antonio and Don Luis In the former there are six Sacred Histories by  Luca Jordano  from passages in the Life of the Virgin Mary also an Absalom and a small sketch by  the same hand two sketches by  Cor∣rado  a Saint Joseph with the young Jesus about ten years of age by  Spagnolet  a Saint Sebastian and a Magdalen by the same Charles V haranguing his Army by  Titian  Or∣pheus harping to the Beasts by  Ru∣bens  and a Vulcan by the same ma∣ster with a large Flemish painting of Still Life finely coloured and capital in its stile  In the quarter of Don Antonio there are several by  Luca Jordano  on sacred as well as fabulous story A pourtrait of a Youth in Armour by  Vandyke  another of  Carreno  after  Velasquez  and a composition after  Rubens  on the subject of Moses and Pharaoh's Daughter  In the apartments late appropri∣ated to Don Luis we find the copies which  Rubens  made of  Titian  's fa∣mous pictures of the Cupids and Bac∣chanals above described and which  Mengs  so tauntingly compared to a Dutch translation There are several others of the same master particu∣larly a Saint George slaying the Dragon of the size of life coloured with surprising brilliancy but in a gaudy stile and flattering Amongst the works of  Rubens  there is an Ar∣chimedes a Mercury Hercules kil∣ling the Hydra Apollo and Pan and two pourtraits of Ladies of the House of Medici with some sketches two pourtraits by  Vandyke  one very capital of the Infant Don Ferdinand There is a Woman with  several boys in the manner of  Leo∣nardo de Vinci  a Scriptural Piece by  Paul Veronese  a Christ of the size of life with the Cross by  Guido  a pourtrait of a Woman by  Titian  of a Man by  Vandyke  and some beautiful Flowerpieces by  Brughel  Having mentioned some pictures cast out of the royal collection which I saw in the custody of an artist belonging to the king it may be proper to observe that they con∣sist of five capital  Titians  the first of which is his inestimable  Venus  once the property of King Charles I of England described in the  Anecdotes    vol i p  the greatest model of beauty and perfection in the world A  Venus and Cupid  with a Per∣son in the background playing on  an Organ the Venus recumbent on a couch A  Venus  of the same size attitude c with the addition of a little Dog which she is caress∣ing A  Venus  in the action of holding back  Adonis  in her embrace who is setting out for the chace with his dogs c A  Danae  naked re∣ceiving the golden shower There is also a halflength pourtrait of  Ti∣tian  by his own hand Besides these there is a  Venus  by  Paul Ve∣ronese  and an  Adonis  and  Cupid  by  Annibal Caracci  an  Atalanta  and  Hippomenes  in the Race by  Guido  of consummate beauty The figures are of very tall life the outline as glittering as  Corregio  the limbs di∣vinely graceful and the air of the heads unspeakably elegant and ex∣pressive  the attitudes perhaps have more of the academy than might be wished the colouring warmer than his usual hue Of  Rubens  there are several and such as would dignify the first collections in Europe viz  The Rape of the Sabines The Baths of Diana  a  Bacchanalian Tri∣umph  wherein several Bacchants are plucking fruits and the figure of Bacchus himself in a capital stile a  Perseus and Andromeda  which is a wonderful picture a group of  Juno Minerva  and  Venus Paris carrying away Helen  capital and  The Judg∣ment of Paris  with the Rival God∣desses a matchless piece of colour∣ing all of the size of life and the very best of the master There are  also two beautiful pictures by  Al∣bano  one of them  The Judgment of Paris  the other a  Venus  coming out of the Bath and a  Lot and his Daughters  by  Andrea del Sarto  I need not observe what an accession these inestimable pictures might be to the collection in the palace  The royal chapel of the palace is a very beautiful piece of archi∣tecture supported by vast columns of Biscayan black and white marble each of one entire block and in the sacristy and chaplain's room there are several fine pictures by  Spagnolet Murillo Luca Jordano Corrado Cambiaso Alonzo Cano  and other Spanish masters besides which there is a Descent from the Cross by  Al∣bert  Durer  and a Conversationpiece of Saint Anthony and Saint Paul the Hermit by  Andrea Sacchi  Old Palace of the BuenRetiro  In the chamber called  de los Rey∣nos  there are twelve large Battlepieces by Spanish masters and the Labours of Hercules boldly exe∣cuted by  Francisco Zurbaran  In the antichamber to the queen's apartment there are two large pic∣tures by  Luca Jordano  some by  Rico  a Neapolitan and the representation of an Auto de Fé by  Francisco Rizi  a Roman Triumph by  Bor∣giani  and a fine pourtrait of Hen∣ry II of France ascribed to  Titian  also pourtraits of  Ferdinand  and  Isa∣bella  In the chamber of Castrillo a Tantalus and an Ixion both by  Spagnolet  colossal and of striking expression a view of Saint Peter's in Rome Saint Mark's Place in Venice and the Vatican with the Pope and Cardinals in procession  In a passageroom leading from this chamber there are some noble pictures of  Snyders John Tillen  and  Peter de Vos  in the Huntingpieces of  De Vos  there are several persons introduced with wonderful spirit and expression A capital composition by  Rubens  of Hercules slaying the Hy∣dra the Queen Mother of Charles II of Spain two fulllengths of Charles V by  Juan Pantoia de la Cruz  two of Philip IV of different ages and one of a Buffoon in the  stile of  Velasquez  several Sacred Histories finely executed by Bassan and some by  Estevan Marc  In a large room adjoining are two grand Historical Compositions by  Pedro de Cortona  in both which he has introduced Pope Urban VIII with his Cardinals and views of the Vatican two small compositions on the subject of Diana by  Titian  painted in his latter age a Mercury and Argos by  Jordaens  and several excellent  Bassans  and some land∣scapes by  Marc  In the Courtroom many pic∣tures by  Luca Jordano  a large Bac∣chanalian piece by  Cornelius de Vos  a large Fruitpiece of unparalleled execution and variety representing  the Golden Age by  Adrian Van Utrecht  with nine figures of the School of  Rubens  also another ad∣mirable piece of Fruits Birds c to which  Van Utrecht  has set his name and the date of the year Orpheus redeeming Eurydice from Hell by  Rubens  a capital Land∣scape signed with the Name of  Jor∣daens  in which he has represented Vertumnus and Pomona naked figures  In a small room next to this some copies by  Luca Jordano  and a su∣perb picture by  Rubens  representing the Fall of the Giants a Saturn de∣vouring a Child by the same A fine composition by  Nicholas Poussin  with an Amphitheatre and many  figures amongst which are four Ele∣phants and several other pictures which I forbear to enumerate  In one of the private chapels there is a fine Altarpiece by  Vasari  with the Holy Family at fulllength admirably executed other pictures by  Luca Jordano  and the Spanish masters  In the passage to this chapel hangs an original drawing by  Raphael  of his famous Battlepiece of Constan∣tine and Maxentius now in the Va∣tican an exquisite  Parmegiano  of the Espousals of Christ with Saint Catherine the Centurion at the Feet of our Saviour a fine picture by  Paul Veronese  a grand Head of Saint Jerom by  Guido  the four Evangelists by  Rubens  and sketches  of the famous pictures he made for the Convent of Loeches by com∣mission from Olivarez some heads of Martyrs by  Spagnolet  several pictures by  Corrado  and a very fine composition by  Marc  All these va∣luable pieces are buried in a dark lobby and every spectator who has a feeling for merit in obscurity will regard them with a mixture of ad∣miration and regret  In the apartments of the Infants we again meet with several very fine Scriptural Histories by  Bassan  in a stile superior to any thing I have elsewhere seen of that master some landscapes by  Claud Lorrain  several large compositions by  Sneyder  and a variety of pictures of the Spanish School  In the passage to this apartment many curious pieces will be found amongst them a Saint J  es by  Paul Veronese  very fine a beautiful Ver∣tumnus and Pomona by  Rubens  a halflength of a Woman with a basket on her arm by  Spagnolet  a Saint Francis by the same some excellent pourtraits by  Leonardo de Vinci  and other old masters a Boy and an old Woman a candlelight very capital by  Rembrandt  Pilate washing his Hands by  Guercino  a noble picture and a Sacrifice to Po∣mona exquisitely finished by  Jacobo Jordaeno  In a room adjoining there is a great collection of  Sneyders Bassan Golze Bosco Dominichino Francisco Perez Luca Jordano  and others  A Lucretia by  Guido  full length of the size of life in the act of selfdestruction a matchless picture that would dignify the first collection in Europe  In this deserted palace are to be seen the celebrated frescos of  Luca Jordano  supposed to be the very best of the master The climate at least has been favourable to them for they are in fresh and perfect pre∣servation  In the queen's chamber are some incomparable performances of  Gas∣par Poussin  a Firework in the Spa∣nish Square at Rome finely painted by  Sebastian Conca  an Herodias by  Caravagio  a Hercules by  Caesar Tracarzane  and many others worth attention  There is a grand sketch of  Tinio∣rett  's famous Last Supper in the quarter of the late Infant Don Luis some fine  Spagnolets  and two very curious Histories of Adam and Eve the size of life signed as fol∣lows  Albertus Durerus Almanus fa∣ciebat post Virginis partum    The Theatre though now in dis∣use is extremely fine and so con∣trived as to admit of the whole back scene to be occasionally drawn off and laid open to the garden The paintings are by  Amiconi  From this imperfect account of the paintings in this deserted palace it will readily be acknowledged that it still contains a very respect∣able collection and that a superb gallery might be furnished by  draughts of the capital pictures still remaining in it  In the little suburban palace called  The Caso del Càmpo  are some curious Caprichios of the noted  Ja∣cobo Calot  representing the Temp∣tations of St Anthony and an alle∣gorical invention of  Geronimo Bosch  which in wildness of idea exceeds every thing that ever fell from the pencil of an artist The design is the Creation of Man and the state to which his nature may be reduced by vice the painter having described the human passions by a vast multi∣tude of symbolical figures of Birds Beasts and monstrous compounds The conceits of this moral and sa∣tyrical humourist are infinite a man of curiosity may amuse a leisure hour  in the examination of them but I am persuaded the reader will readily excuse me from attempting to de∣scribe them  The churches and convents of Madrid are possessed of very many fine paintings and it is in them the works of the Spanish masters will be found in the greatest number and perfection Several of them how∣ever contain very capital produc∣tions of the best Italian painters and in particular the Convent of San Pasqual on the Prado to which Cabrera great admiral of Castile bequeathed his whole valuable col∣lection There is a large Altarpiece by  Guercino  superlatively fine and several capital paintings on the  altars and in the sacristy by  Jacobo Palma Leonardo de Vinci Titian Andrea Schiavone Paul Veronese Guercino Vandyke Bassan Luca Jor∣dano  and  Spagnolet  A lover of the art must not omit to visit the Con∣vent of San Placido if it were only for the purpose of contemplating that wonderful picture of the Dead Christ on the Cross painted by Ve∣lasquez in the year though he will find further gratification for his curiosity in the same convent which possesses two of the very best pictures which  Claudio Coello  ever composed  As these churches and convents are very numerous the research would be much too intricate and la∣borious without a clue but this will  be so readily had in the  Viage de Espana  before mentioned that a tra∣veller has only to provide himself with those volumes and he will there find an excellent guide for his curiosity  FINIS
