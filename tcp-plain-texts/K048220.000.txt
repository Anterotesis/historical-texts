to raise but a little money Oh for a few beards to mow even at an asper a chin If IWhat's this  looking on the ground takes the letter up which Zebede dropt Reads the superscription  For his Highness the Bassa of Bagdad  trod under foot  Now if I could deliver this letter to the Bassa myself he'd probably give me a reward sufficient to defray the charges of my wedding How the deuce shall I get ad∣mission though My old Uncle has always kept me at such a distance that I'm not even known at the palace and the attendants there are so saucyNo they'll never let a poor strange barber pass the antichamber  Crumpy sings without  Odso here comes little Crumpy the Bassa's favourite Hunchback jester he's a goodnatur'd fellow and from my saving him from a beating in the street quarrel that his jokes brought him into the other nightIf I could prevail on himhe has high interest at court and  enter Crumpy singing and dancing  How do you do Mr Crumpy  Crumpy  Fellow  proudly but changes on recollecting Absalom  Ha my gay spiritedmy little finger  holds out his hand  don't slip my ring off Your prowess in that reencounter when those villains attacked me the other night savedDid you ever see the like The fellows thresh'd me as if I was a wheatsheaf had I the lives of seven cats they'd have hammered them out for there I lay like a little anvil and the rascals laid on me like so many Cyclops turn'd me about as if was a threepenny nailonly for your passing by just at the nick those ruffians would have broke my bones Yes they'd have crack'd my ivory their heads were so hard and their fists so heavy that my great wit and little bodyOh dear  Abs  Going to the palace I presume Sir  Crumpy  Ay his Highness has got into a merry mood and just sent for me  Abs  Then Sir that horse with the fine trappings that I saw the slaves take by just now was to carry you to court  Crumpy  Yes they had the insolence to think I'd peck upon a poney but if I must ride to court it shall be on an elephant  Abs  Certainly Sir  Crumpy  By virtue of my high office lord chief jus∣tice joker I am obliged when called upon to be pro∣vided with some comical story to divert him entre nous though my wit is as ready as any man's I am some times plaguily put to it but as I'm determined to keep my place to pick up novelty and character I get upon those night rambles in the street which often with a little of my ingenuity in dressing up furnish a good merry tale or pleasant incident for the Bassa to laugh at the next morning  Abs  I thought Sir you statesmen was too wise to laugh  Crumpy  He that's wise enough to refuse a good hearty laugh in this world will be cursedly bob'd if there should be no laughing in the next Here he has sent for me now takes me a little unprovided so I'll go make my bow and retire  Abs  What a prodigious favourite you are Sir  Crumpy  Ay ay the Circassian beauties dance am∣bassadories black blue and yellow pay compliments courtiers smile cringe and tell

Crumpy  Only one real t'other was pluck'd off by the roots in that affray this is false a favourite lock fell from the forehead of a celebrated beauty at the last ball I pick'd it up and stuck it on with a little gum and it graces the lip of her humble admirer Ha ha ha  Abs  How gallant  Crumpy  Yet the courtiers smil'd the ladies teehee'd but  Honi soit  I should not wonder if the circumstance gave birth to an order of knighthood and the black eagle and golden fleece give way to the knights of the whisker  Abs  Ha ha ha Sir I've a letter here for the Bassa and  Crumpy  A petition Give it me I'll deliver it into his Highness's own hand  Abs  Ah Sir if you'd only procure me the honour of laying it at his Highness's own feet  Crumpy  You serv'd me I will be grateful you shall have an audience come along my noble shaver  going  Abs  Ay but will his Highness condescend to listen to so poor a fellow as I  Crumpy  What don't you know our Bassa has tra∣velled through Europe been at the English court whose king has been the model for all his noblest actions like their gracious monarch the father of his people he is above the little consideration of the co∣lour of a face or the sod where a man first drew breath when diftress is to be relieved or merit rewarded  Abs  But Sir if any of the grand officers in waiting should stop me  Crumpy  What when I take you by the hand  Abs  These court eunuchs are such great men  Crumpy  They great men the rascals slaves ah hah trip skip come tol lol lol  Exit singing and dancing Absalom follows admiring him  SCENE II An Antichamber of

within three hours after the receipt of this you have yourself strangled but first leave orders for your head to be cut offand sent to us This fail not to do on pain of our high displeasure  Ha ha ha  Zeb  Well I did not think that strangling and be∣heading was so good a joke  Bassa  Yes he does not know that I am in pos∣session of this other letter that countermands this order  reads  Given at our Sublime Port  th year of the Hegira ACI  T  Since my Emperor thinks I should die I obey    isses the letter  and this night I sup with Mahometto  my very careful steward  aside  I'll first settle my worldly affairs instantly prepare your accounts for my inspection  Zeb  Oh the devil I have cheated him so dam∣nably that my head goes off if he finds out my rogue∣ries  aside  Sir you'd best think of nothing now but obeying the Emperor's command he may be angry indeed he says instantly send me your head on pain of our high displeasure  Bassa  Now I'll put his fidelity to the full proof  aside  I am surprised my friend the Vizier would not inter∣pose in my behalf not even to condole or comfort me Pray was there no other letter came with this  Zeb  No as I am an honest man this is all the letter I gotExcept the one I dropp'd  aside  Bassa  Then I must die  Zeb  Do my Lord it will prove your great loyalty and your readiness to oblige the Grand Signior dear yes my Lord and here your

you go sup with him in my stead  Zeb  Thank you Sir but I eat no supper nowadays  Bassa  Refuse the honour of supping above with our great prophet  Zeb  'Tis a great honour but I'd rather eat even a pork chop here below than partake of the finest feast that was ever prepar'd above for Mahomet's table  Bassa  Changing to firm resentment  Where's the other letter you received for me  Zeb  Ruin'd Somebody's told him  aside and terrified  Oh mercy my lord as I hope for heaven I dropt it out of my pocket  Bassa  Then heaven shall be your reward first for your negligence of such a precious charge

 The important service of bringing me that letter lost by his negligence has a claim much beyond that promise Live  to Zebede the mutes quit him  Zeb  Gracious Highness  with great joy  Oh my dear
