of Divinity And some Remarks on the VERSION  LONDON  Printed for  T Boreman  at the Cock on  LudgateHill  and sold by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster  Price One Shilling  TO  ALEXANDER POPE  Esq  SIR  _I Have so great a Trust in your Indulgence toward me as to believe you cannot but Patronize this Imitation so much in your own Manner and whose Birth I may truly say is owing to you In that Confidence I would not suppress the Criticisms made upon it by the  Reverend Doctor  the rather since he has promised to  mend the Faults  in the next Edition with the same Goodness he has practised to  Milton  I hope you will believe that while I express my Regard for you it is only out of Modesty I conceal my Name since tho' perhaps I may not profess myself your Admirer so much as some others I cannot but be with as much inward Respect Goodwill and Zeal as any Man  Dear Sir  Your most Affectionate AND Faithful Servant  Q HORATII FLACCI  SERMO II L I  TEXTUM  Recensuit  V R
