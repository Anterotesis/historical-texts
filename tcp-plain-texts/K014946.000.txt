I  TO Sir RICHARD TEMPLE Lord COBHAM  ARGUMENT Of the Knowlege and Characters of MEN  THAT it is not sufficient for this knowlege to consider man in the  abstract books  will not serve the purpose nor yet our own  experience  singly  v  General maxims unless they be formed upon  both  will be but notional  v  Some peculiarity in every man characteristic to himself yet varying from himself  v  Difficulties arising from our own passions fancies faculties  etc v  The shortness of life to observe in and the uncertainty of the  principles of action  in men to observe by  v etc  Our  own  principle of action often hid from ourselves  v  Some few characters plain but in general confounded dissembled or inconsistent  v  The same man  utterly different in different places and seasons  v  Unimaginable weaknesses in the greatest  v etc  Nothing constant and certain but God and Nature  v  No judging of the  motives  from the actions the same actions proceeding from contrary motives and the same motives influencing contrary actions  v II  Yet to form  characters  we can only take the  strongest actions  of a man's life and try to make them  agree  the utter uncertainty of this from  nature  itself and from  policy v Characters  given according to the  rank  of men of the world  v  And some reason for it  v Education  alters the  nature  or at least  character  of many  v Actions passions opinions manners humours  or  principles  all subject to change No judging by  nature  from  v  to  III  It only remains to find if we can his  RULING PASSION  that will certainly influence all the rest and can reconcile the seeming or real inconsistency of all his actions  v  Instanced in the extraordinary character of  Clodio v  A caution against mistaking  second qualities  for  first  which will destroy all possibility of the knowlege of mankind  v  Examples of the strength of the  ruling passion  and its continuation to the last breath  v etc  EPISTLE I  YES you despise the man to books confin'd  Who from his study rails at human kind  Tho' what he learns he speaks and may advance  Some gen'ral maxims or be right by chance  The coxcomb bird so talkative and grave  That from his cage cries cuckold whore and knave  Tho' many a passenger he rightly call  You hold him no philosopher at all  And yet the fate of all extremes is such  Men may be read as well as books too much  To observations which ourselves we make  We grow more partial for th' observer's sake  To written wisdom as another's less  Maxims are drawn from notions those from guess  There's some peculiar in each leaf and grain  Some unmark'd fibre or some varying vein  Shall only man be taken in the gross  Grant but as many sorts of mind as moss  That each from other differs first confess  Next that he varies from himself no less  Add nature's custom's reason's passion's strife  And all opinion's colours cast on life  Our depths who fathoms or our shallows finds  Quick whirls and shifting eddies of our minds  On human actions reason tho' you can  It may be reason but it is not man  His principle of action once explore  That instant 'tis his principle no more  Like following life thro' creatures you dissect  You lose it in the moment you detect  Yet more the diff'rence is as great between  The optics seeing as the objects seen  All manners take a tincture from our own  Or come discolour'd thro' our passions shown  Or fancy's beam enlarges multiplies  Contracts inverts and gives ten thousand dyes  Nor will life's stream for observation stay  It hurries all too fast to mark their way  In vain sedate reflections we would make  When half our knowlege we must snatch not take  Oft in the passions' wild rotation tost  Our spring of action to ourselves is lost  Tir'd not determin'd to the last we yield  And what comes then is master of the field  As the last image of that troubled heap  When sense subsides and fancy sports in sleep  Tho' past the recollection of the thought  Becomes the stuff of which our dream is wrought  Something as dim to our internal view  Is thus perhaps the cause of most we do  True some are open and to all men known  Others so very close they're hid from none  So darkness strikes the sense no less than light  Thus gracious CHANDOS is belov'd at sight  And ev'ry child hates Shylock tho' his soul  Still sits at squat and peeps not from its hole  At half mankind when gen'rous Manly raves  All know 'tis virtue for he thinks them knaves  When universal homage Umbra pays  All see 'tis vice and itch of vulgar praise  When flatt'ry glares all hate it in a queen  While one there is who charms us with his spleen  But these plain characters we rarely find  Tho' strong the bent yet quick the turns of mind  Or puzzling contraries confound the whole  Or affectations quite reverse the soul  The dull flat falshood serves for policy  And in the cunning truth itself's a lye  Unthoughtof frailties cheat us in the wise  The fool lies hid in inconsistencies  See the same man in vigour in the gout  Alone in company in place or out  Early at bus'ness and at hazard late  Mad at a foxchace wise at a debate  Drunk at a borough civil at a ball  Friendly at Hackney faithless at Whitehall  Catius is ever moral ever grave  Thinks who endures a knave is next a knave  Save just at dinnerthen prefers no doubt  A rogue with ven'son to a saint without  Who would not praise Patritio's high desert  His hand unstain'd his uncorrupted heart  His comprehensive head all int'rests weigh'd  All Europe sav'd yet Britain not betray'd  He thanks you not his pride is in picquette  Newmarketfame and judgment at a bett  What made say Montagne or more sage Charron  Otho a warrior Cromwell a buffoon  A perjur'd prince a leaden saint revere  VER  A perjur'd prince  Louis XI of France wore in his hat a leaden image of the Virgin Mary which when he swore by he feared to break his oath  A godless regent tremble at a star  The throne a bigot keep a genius quit  VER  The throne a bigot keep a genius quit  Philip V of Spain who after renouncing the throne for religion resumed it to gratify his queen and Victor Amadeus II king of Sardinia who resigned the crown and trying to reassume it was imprisoned till his death  Faithless thro' piety and dup'd thro' wit  Europe a woman child or dotard rule  And just her wisest monarch made a fool  Know GOD and NATURE only are the same  In man the judgment shoots at flying game  A bird of passage gone as soon as found  Now in the moon perhaps now under ground  In vain the sage with retrospective eye  Would from th' apparent what conclude the why  Infer the motive from the deed and shew  That what we chanc'd was what we meant to do  Behold if fortune or a mistress frowns  Some plunge in bus'ness others shave their crowns  To ease the soul of one oppressive weight  This quits an empire that embroils a state  The same adust complexion has impell'd  Charles to the convent Philip to the field  Not always actions shew the man we find  Who does a kindness is not therefore kind  Perhaps prosperity becalm'd his breast  Perhaps the wind just shifted from the east  Not therefore humble he who seeks retreat  Pride guides his steps and bids him shun the great  Who combats bravely is not therefore brave  He dreads a deathbed like the meanest slave  Who reasons wisely is not therefore wise  His pride in reas'ning not in acting lies  But grant that actions best discover man  Take the most strong and sort them as you can  The few that glare each character must mark  You balance not the many in the dark  What will you do with such as disagree  Suppress them or miscall them policy  Must then at once the character to save  The plain rough hero turn a crafty knave  Alas in truth the man but chang'd his mind  Perhaps was sick in love or had not din'd  Ask why from Britain Caesar would retreat  Caesar himself might whisper he was beat  Why risk the world's great empire for a punk  Caesar perhaps might answer he was drunk  But sage historians 'tis your task to prove  One action conduct one heroic love  'Tis from high life high characters are drawn  A saint in crape is twice a saint in lawn  A judge is just a chanc'lor juster still  A gownman learn'd a bishop what you will  Wise if a minister but if a king  More wise more learn'd more just more ev'ry thing  Courtvirtues bear like gems the highest rate  Born where heav'n's influence scarce can penetrate  In life's low vale the soil the virtues like  They please as beauties here as wonders strike  Tho' the same sun with alldiffusive rays  Blush in the rose and in the di'mond blaze  We prize the stronger effort of his pow'r  And justly set the gem above the flow'r  'Tis education forms the common mind  Just as the twig is bent the tree's inclin'd  Boastful and rough your first son is a 'squire  The next a tradesman meek and much a lyar  Tom struts a soldier open bold and brave  Will sneaks a scriv'ner an exceeding knave  Is he a churchman then he's fond of pow'r  A quaker sly A presbyterian sow'r  A smart freethinker all things in an hour  Ask men's opinions Scoto now shall tell  How trade increases and the world goes well  Strike off his pension by the setting sun  And Britain if not Europe is undone  That gay freethinker a fine talker once  What turns him now a stupid silent dunce  Some God or Spirit he has lately found  Or chanc'd to meet a minister that frown'd  Judge we by nature Habit can efface  Int'rest o'ercome or policy take place  By actions those uncertainty divides  By passions these dissimulation hides  Opinions they still take a wider range  Find if you can in what you cannot change  Manners with fortunes humours turn with climes  Tenets with books and principles with times  Search then the RULING PASSION there alone  The wild are constant and the cunning known  The fool consistent and the false sincere  Priests princes women no dissemblers here  This clue once found unravels all the rest  The prospect clears and Wharton stands confest  Wharton the scorn and wonder of our days  Whose ruling passion was the lust of praise  Born with whate'er could win it from the wise  Women and fools must like him or he dies  Tho' wond'ring senates hung on all he spoke  The club must hail him master of the joke  Shall parts so various aim at nothing new  He'll shine a Tully and a Wilmot too  VER John Wilmot E of Rochester famous for his wit and extravagancies in the time of Charles the second  Then turns repentant and his God adores  With the same spirit that he drinks and whores  Enough if all around him but admire  And now the punk applaud and now the fryer  Thus with each gift of nature and of art  And wanting nothing but an honest heart  Grown all to all from no one vice exempt  And most contemptible to shun contempt  His passion still to covet gen'ral praise  His life to forfeit it a thousand ways  A constant bounty which no friend has made  An angel tongue which no man can persuade  A fool with more of wit than half mankind  Too rash for thought for action too refin'd  A tyrant to the wife her heart approves  A rebel to the very king he loves  He dies sad outcast of each church and state  And harder still flagitious yet not great  Ask you why Wharton broke thro' ev'ry rule  'Twas all for fear the knaves should call him fool  Nature well known no prodigies remain  Comets are regular and Wharton plain  Yet in this search the wisest may mistake  If second qualities for first they take  When Catiline by rapine swell'd his store  When Caesar made a noble dame a whore  In this the lust in that the avarice  Were means not ends ambition was the vice  That very Caesar born in Scipio's days  Had aim'd like him by chastity at praise  Lucullus when frugality could charm  Had roasted turnips in the Sabin farm  In vain th' observer eyes the builder's toil  But quite mistakes the scaffold for the pile  In this one passion man can strength enjoy  As fits give vigour just when they destroy  Time that on all things lays his lenient hand  Yet tames not this it sticks to our last sand  Consistent in our follies and our sins  Here honest nature ends as she begins  Old politicians chew on wisdom past  And totter on in bus'ness to the last  As weak as earnest and as gravely out  As sober Lanesb'row dancing in the gout  VER  Lanesborow  An ancient nobleman who continued this practice long after his legs were disabled by the gout Upon the death of prince George of Denmark he demanded an audience of the queen to advise her to preserve her health and dispel her grief by  dancing  Behold a rev'rend fire whom want of grace  Has made the father of a nameless race  Shov'd from the wall perhaps or rudely press'd  By his own son that passes by unbless'd  Still to his wench he crawls on knocking knees  And envies ev'ry sparrow that he sees  A salmon's belly Helluo was thy fate  The doctor call'd declares all help too late  " Mercy cries Helluo mercy on my soul  " Is there no hopeAlasthen bring the jowl"  The frugal crone whom praying priests attend  Still tries to save the hallow'd taper's end  Collects her breath as ebbing life retires  For one puff more and in that puff expires  " Odious in woollen 'twould a saint provoke  Were the last words that poor Narcissa spoke  VER  the last words that poor Narcissa spoke  This story as well as the others is founded on fact though the author had the goodness not to mention the names Several attribute this in particular to a very celebrated actress who in detestation of the thought of being buried in woollen gave these her last orders with her dying breath  " No let a charming Chintz and Brussels lace  " Wrap my cold limbs and shade my lifeless face  " One would not sure be frightful when one's dead  " AndBettygive this cheek a little red"  The courtier smooth who forty years had shin'd  An humble servant to all human kind  Just brought out this when scarce his tongue could stir  " Ifwhere I'm goingI could serve you Sir"  " I give and I devise old Euclio said  And sigh'd "my lands and tenements to Ned  Your money Sir"My money Sir what all  " Whyif I mustthen wept I give it Paul  " The manor Sir"The manor hold he cry'd  " Not thatI cannot part with that"and dy'd  And you brave COBHAM to the latest breath  Shall feel your ruling passion strong in death  Such in those moments as in all the past  " Oh save my country heav'n" shall be your last  VARIATIONS  After v in the former editions  Triumphant leaders at an army's head  Hemm'd round with glories pilfer cloth or bread  As meanly plunder as they bravely fought  Now save a people and now save a groat  VER in the former editions  Ask why from Britain Caesar made retreat  Caesar himself would tell you he was beat  The mighty Czar what mov'd to wed a punk  The mighty Czar would tell you he was drunk  In the former editions v  Nature well known no Miracles remain  MORAL ESSAYS  EPISTLE II  TO A LADY  Of the Characters of WOMEN  NOTHING so true as what you once let fall  " Most women have no characters at all"  Matter too soft a lasting mark to bear  And best distinguish'd by black brown or fair  How many

sinner it or saint it  If folly grows romantic I must paint it  Come then the colours and the ground prepare  Dip in the rainbow trick her off in air  Chuse a firm cloud before it fall and in it  Catch ere she change the Cynthia of this minute  VER Instances of contrarieties given even from such characters as are most strongly marked and seemingly therefore most consistent as I In the Affected ver etc  Rufa whose eye quickglancing o'er the park  Attracts each light gay meteor of a spark  Agrees as ill with Rufa studying Locke  As Sappho's di'monds with her dirty smock  Or Sappho at her toilet's greazy task  With Sappho fragrant at an ev'ning mask  So morning insects that in muck begun  Shine buzz and flyblow in the settingsun  VER and II Contrarieties in the Softnatured  How soft is Silia fearful to offend  The frail one's advocate the weak one's friend  To her Calista prov'd her conduct nice  And good Simplicius asks of her advice  Sudden she storms she raves you tip the wink  But spare your censure Silia does not drink  All eyes may see from what the change arose  All eyes may seea pimple on her nose  VER and II Contrarieties in the Softnatured  Papillia wedded to her am'rous spark  Sighs for the shades"how charming is a park"  A park is purchas'd but the fair he sees  All bath'd in tears"oh odious odious trees"  Ladies like variegated tulips show  'Tis to their changes half their charms we owe  Fine by defect and delicately weak  Their happy spots the nice admirer take  VER III Contrarieties in the Cunning and Artful  'Twas thus Calypso once each heart alarm'd  Aw'd without virtue without beauty charm'd  Her tongue hewitch'd as odly as her eyes  Less wit than mimic more a wit than wise  Strange graces still and stranger flights she had  Was just not ugly and was just not mad  Yet ne'er so sure our passion to create  As when she touch'd the brink of all we hate  VER IV In the Whimsical  Narcissa's nature tolerably mild  To make a wash would hardly stew a child  Has ev'n been prov'd to grant a lover's pray'r  And paid a tradesman once to make him stare  Gave alms at Easter in a Christian trim  And made a widow happy for a whim  Why then declare goodnature is her scorn  When 'tis by that alone she can be born  Why pique all mortals yet affect a name  A fool to pleasure yet a slave to fame  Now deep in Taylor and the Book of Martyrs  Now drinking citron with his grace and Chartres  Now conscience chills her and now passion burns  And atheism and religion take their turns  A very heathen in the carnal part  Yet still a sad good Christian at her heart  VER V In the Lewd and Vicions  See sin in state majestically drunk  Proud as a peeress prouder as a punk  Chaste to her husband frank to all beside  A teeming mistress but a barren bride  What then let blood and body bear the fault  Her head's untouch'd that noble seat of thought  Such this day's doctrinein another fit  She sins with poets thro' pure love of wit  What has not fir'd her bosom or her brain  Caesar and Tallboy Charles and Charlema'ne  As Helluo late dictator of the feast  The nose of Hautgout and the tip of taste  Critiqu'd your wine and analyz'd your meat  Yet on plain pudding deign'd at home to eat  So Philomede lect'ring all mankind  On the soft passion and the taste refin'd  Th' address the delicacystoops at once  And makes her hearty meal upon a dunce  VER Contrarieties in the Witty and Refin'd  Flavia's a wit has too much sense to pray  To toast our wants and wishes is her way  Nor asks of God but of her stars to give  The mighty blessing "while we live to live"  Then all for death that opiate of the soul  Lucretia's dagger Rosamonda's bowl  Say what can cause such impotence of mind  A spark too fickle or a spouse too kind  Wise wretch with pleasures too refin'd to please  With too much spirit to be e'er at ease  With too much quickness ever to be taught  With too much thinking to have common thought  You purchase pain with all that joy can give  And die of nothing but a rage to live  Turn then from wits and look on Simo's mate  No ass so meek no ass so obstinate  Or her that owns her faults but never mends  Because she's honest and the best of friends  Or her whose life the church and scandal share  For ever in a passion or a pray'r  Or her who laughs at hell but like her grace  Cries "Ah how charming if there's no such place"  Or who in sweet vicissitude appears  Of mirth and opium ratafie and tears  The daily anodyne and nightly draught  To kill those foes to fair ones time and thought  Woman and fool are too hard things to hit  For true nomeaning puzzles more than wit  But what are these to great Atossa's mind  Scarce once herself by turns all womankind  Who with herself or others from her birth  Finds all her life one warfare upon earth  Shines in exposing knaves and painting fools  Yet is whate'er she hates and ridicules  No thought advances but her eddy brain  Whisks it about and down it goes again  Full sixty years the world has been her trade  The wisest fool much time has ever made  From loveless youth to unrespected age  No passion gratify'd except her rage  So much the fury still outran the wit  The pleasure miss'd her and the scandal hit  Who breaks with her provokes revenge from hell  But he's a bolder man who dares be well  Her ev'ry turn with violence pursu'd  Nor more a storm her hate than gratitude  To that each passion turns or soon or late  Love if it makes her yield must make her hate  Superiors death and equals what a curse  But an inferior not dependant worse  Offend her and she knows not to forgive  Oblige her and she'll hate you while you live  But die and she'll adore youthen the bust  And temple risethen fall again to dust  Last night her lord was all that's good and great  A knave this morning and his will a cheat  Strange by the means defeated of the ends  By spirit robb'd of pow'r by warmth of friends  By wealth of follow'rs without one distress  Sick of herself thro' very selfishness  Atossa curs'd with ev'ry granted pray'r  Childless with all her children wants an heir  To heirs unknown descends th' unguarded store  Or wanders heav'ndirected to the poor  Pictures like these dear madam to design  Asks no firm hand and no unerring line  Some wand'ring touches some reflected light  Some flying stroke alone can hit 'em right  For how should equal colours do the knack  Chameleons who can paint in white and black  " Yet Cloe sure was form'd without a spot"  Nature in her then err'd not but forgot  " With ev'ry pleasing ev'ry prudent part  " Say what can Cloe want"she wants a heart  She speaks behaves and acts just as she ought  But never never reach'd one gen'rous thought  Virtue she finds too painful an endeavour  Content to dwell in decencies for ever  So very reasonable so unmov'd  As never yet to love or to be lov'd  She while her lover pants upon her breast  Can mark the figures on an Indian chest  And when she sees her friend in deep despair  Observes how much a chintz exceeds mohair  Forbid it heav'n a favour or a debt  She e'er should cancelbut she may forget  Safe is your secret still in Cloe's ear  But none of Cloe's shall you ever hear  Of all her dears she never slander'd one  But cares not if a thousand are undone  Would Cloe know if you're alive or dead  She bids her footman put it in her head  Cloe is prudentwould you too be wise  Then never break your heart when Cloe dies  One certain portrait may I grant be seen  Which heav'n has varnish'd out and made a Queen  THE SAME FOR EVER and describ'd by all  With truth and goodness as with crown and ball  Poets heap virtues painters gems at will  And show their zeal and hide their want of skill  'Tis wellbut artists who can paint or write  To draw the naked is your true delight  That robe of quality so struts and swells  None see what parts of nature it conceals  Th' exactest traits of body or of mind  We owe to models of an humble kind  If QUEENSBERRY to strip there's no compelling  'Tis from a handmaid we must take a Helen  From peer or bishop 'tis no easy thing  To draw the man who loves his God or king  Alas I copy or my draught would fail  From honest Mah'met or plain parson Hale  VER  Mah'met  servant to the late king said to be the son of a Turkish Bassa whom he took at the siege of Buda and constantly kept about his person  But grant in public men sometimes are shown  VER  But grant in public etc  in the former editions between this and the foregoing lines a want of connection might be perceived occasioned by the omission of certain  examples  and  illustrations  to the maxims laid down and though some of these have since been found  viz  the characters of Philomede Atossa Cloe and some verses following others are still wanting nor can we answer that these are exactly inserted  A woman's seen in private life alone  Our bolder talents in full light display'd  Your virtues open fairest in the shade  Bred to disguise in public 'tis you hide  There none distinguish 'twixt your shame or pride  Weakness or delicacy all so nice  That each may seem a virtue or a vice  In men we various ruling passions find  VER The former part having shewn that the  particular characters  of women are more various than those of men it is nevertheless observed that the  general  characteristic of the sex as to the ruling passion is more uniform  In women two almost divide the kind  Those only fix'd they first or last obey  The love of pleasure and the love of sway  That nature gives and where the lesson taught  VER This is occasioned partly by their  nature  partly their  education  and in some degree by  necessity  Is but to please can pleasure seem a fault  Experience this by man's oppression curst  They seek the second not to lose the first  Men some to bus'ness some to pleasure take  But ev'ry woman is at heart a rake  Men some to quiet some to public strife  But ev'ry lady would be queen for life  VER What are the  aims  and the  fate  of this sexI As to  power  Yet mark the fate of a whole sex of queens  Pow'r all their end but beauty all the means  In youth they conquer with so wild a rage  As leaves them scarce a subject in their age  For foreign glory foreign joy they roam  No thought of peace or happiness at home  But wisdom's triumph is welltim'd retreat  As hard a science to the fair as great  Beauties like tyrants old and friendless grown  Yet hate repose and dread to be alone  Worn out in public weary ev'ry eye  Nor leave one sigh behind them when they die  VER II As to  pleasure  Pleasures the sex as children birds pursue  Still out of reach yet never out of view  Sure if they catch to spoil the toy at most  To covet flying and regret when lost  At last to follies youth could scarce defend  It grows their age's prudence to pretend  Asham'd to own they gave delight before  Reduc'd to feign it when they give no more  As hags hold sabbaths less for joy than spight  So these their merry miserable night  Still round and round the ghosts of beauty glide  And haunt the places where their honour dy'd  See how the world its veterans rewards  A youth of frolics an old age of cards  Fair to no purpose artful to no end  Young without lovers old without a friend  A fop their passion but their prize a sot  Alive ridiculous and dead forgot  VER Advice for their true interest  Ah friend to dazzle let the vain design  To raise the thought and touch the heart be thine  That charm shall grow while what fatigues the ring  Flaunts and goes down an unregarded thing  So when the sun's broad beam has tir'd the sight  All mild ascends the moon's more sober light  Serene in virgin modesty she shines  And unobserv'd the glaring orb declines  Oh blest with temper whose unclouded ray  Can make tomorrow chearful as today  She who can love a sister's charms or hear  Sighs for a daughter with unwounded ear  She who ne'er answers till a husband cools  Or if she rules him never shows she rules  Charms by accepting by submitting sways  Yet has her humour most when she obeys  Let fops or fortune fly which way they will  Disdains all loss of tickets or codille  Spleen vapours or smallpox above them all  And mistress of herself tho' China fall  And yet believe me good as well as ill  Woman's at best a contradiction still  Heav'n when it strives to polish all it can  Its last best work but forms a softer man  Picks from each sex to make the fav'rite blest  Your love of pleasure our desire of rest  Blends in exception to all gen'ral rules  Your taste of follies with our scorn of fools  Reserve with frankness art with truth ally'd  Courage with softness modesty with pride  Fix'd principles with fancy ever new  Shakes all together and producesyou  Be this a woman's fame with this unblest  Toasts live a scorn and queens may die a jest  This Phoebus promis'd I forget the year  When those blue eyes first open'd on the sphere  Ascendant Phoebus watch'd that hour with care  Averted half your parent's simple pray'r  And gave you beauty but deny'd the pelf  That buys your sex a tyrant o'er itself  The gen'rous god who wit and gold refines  And ripens spirits as he ripens mines  Kept dross for duchesses the world shall know it  To you gave sense goodhumour and a poet  VARIATIONS  VER  What has not fir'd etc  in the MS  In whose mad brain the mixt

their high places and change my subject from their pride to their meanness from their vanities to their miseries and as the only certain way to avoid misconstructions to lessen offence and not to multiply illnatured applications I may probably in my next make use of real names instead of fictitious ones"  P  WHO shall decide when doctors disagree  And soundest casuists doubt like you and me

strange the miser should his cares employ  To gain those riches he can ne'er enjoy  Is it less strange the prodigal should waste  His wealth to purchase what he ne'er can taste  Not for himself he

designs of Inigo Jones and the antiquities of Rome by Palladio  And pompous buildings once were things of use  Yet shall my lord your just your noble rules  Fill half the land with imitatingfools  Who random drawings from your sheets shall take  And of one beauty many blunders make  Load some vain church with old theatric state  Turn arcs of triumph to a gardengate  Reverse your ornaments and hang them all  On some patch'd doghole ek'd with ends of wall  Then clap four slices of pilaster on't  That lac'd with bits of rustic makes a front  Shall call the winds thro' long arcades to rore  Proud to catch cold at a Venetian door  Conscious they act a true Palladian part  And if they starve they starve by rules of art  Oft have you hinted to your brother peer  A certain truth which many buy too dear  Something there is more needful than expence  And something previous ev'n to taste'tis sense  Good sense which only is the gift of heav'n  And tho' no science fairly worth the seven  A light which in yourself you must perceive  Jones and Le Notre have it not to give  VER Inigo Jones the celebrated architect and Mr Le Notre the designer of the best gardens of France  To build to plant what ever you intend  To rear the column or the arch to bend  To swell the terras or to sink the grot  In all let nature never be forgot  But treat the goddess like a modest fair  Nor overdress nor leave

where the greatness and nobleness of the piece is lessened by being divided into too many parts with scrolled works and beds of which the examples are frequent  With all the mournful family of yews  VER  mournful family of Yews  Touches upon the ill taste of those who are so fond of evergreens particularly Yews which are the most tonsile as to destroy nobler foresttrees to make way for such little ornaments as pyramids of darkgreen continually repeated not unlike a funeral procession  The thriving plants ignoble broomsticks made  Now sweep those alleys they were born to shade  At Timon's Villa let us pass a day  VER  At Timon's Villa  This description is intended to comprize the principles of a false taste of magnificence and to exemplify what was said before that nothing but good sense can attain it  Where all cry out "What sums are thrown away  So proud so grand of that stupendous air  Soft and agreeable come never there  Greatness with Timon dwells in such a draught  As brings all Brobdignag before your thought  To compass this his building is a town  His pond an ocean his parterre a down  Who but must laugh the master when he sees  A puny insect shiv'ring at a breeze  Lo what huge heaps of littleness around  The whole a labour'd quarry above ground  Two Cupids squirt before a lake behind  Improves the keenness of the northern wind  His gardens next your admiration call  On ev'ry side you look behold the wall  No pleasing intricacies intervene  No artful wildness to perplex the scene  Grove nods at grove each alley has a brother  And half the platform just reflects the other  The suffring eye inverted nature sees  Trees cut to statues statues thick as trees  With here a fountain never to be play'd  And there a summerhouse that knows no shade  Here Amphitrite sails thro' myrtle bow'rs  There gladiators fight or die in flow'rs  VER The two statues of the  gladiator pugnant  and  gladiator moriens  Unwater'd see the drooping seahorse mourn  And

to understand them Many delight chiefly in the elegance of the print or of the binding some have carried it so far as to cause the upper shelves to be filled with painted books of wood others pique themselves so much upon books in a language they do not understand as to exclude the most useful in one they do  In books not authors curious is my lord  To all their dated backs he turns you round  These Aldus printed those Du Sueil has bound  Lo some are vellom and the rest as good  For all his lordship knows but they are wood  For Locke or Milton 'tis in vain to look  These shelves admit not any modern book  And now the chapel's silver bell you hear  That summons you to all the pride of pray'r  Light quirks of music broken and uneven  Make the soul dance upon a jig to heav'n  On painted

Who never mentions hell to ears polite  This is a fact a reverend Dean preaching at court threatened the sinner with punishment in  "a place which he thought it not decent to name in so polite an assembly"  But hark the chiming clocks to dinner call  A hundred footsteps scrape the marble hall  The rich buffet wellcolour'd serpents grace  VER Taxes the incongruity of  ornaments  though sometimes practised by the ancients where an open mouth ejects the water into a fountain or where the shocking images of serpents etc are introduced in grottos or buffets  And gaping Tritons spew to wash your face  Is this a dinner this a genial room  VER  Is this a dinner etc  The proud festivals of some men are here set forth to ridicule where pride destroys the ease and formal regularity all the pleasurable enjoyment of the entertainment  No 'tis a temple and a hecatomb  A solemn sacrifice perform'd in state  You drink by measure and to minutes eat  So quick retires each flying course you'd swear  Sancho's dread doctor and his wand were there  VER  Sancho's dread doctor  See Don Quixote chap xlvii  Between each act the trembling salvers ring  From soup to sweetwine and God bless the king  In plenty starving tantaliz'd in state  And complaisantly help'd to all I hate  Treated caress'd and tir'd I take my leave  Sick of his civil pride from morn to eve  I curse such lavish cost and little skill  And swear no day was ever past so ill  Yet hence the poor are cloth'd the hungry fed  VER  Yet hence the poor etc  The  moral  of the whole where PROVIDENCE is justified in giving wealth to those who squander it in this manner A bad taste employs more hands and diffuses expence more than a good one This recurs to what is laid down in Book I Ep ii ver and in the epistle preceding this ver etc  Health to himself and to his infants bread  The lab'rer bears what his hard heart denies  His charitable vanity supplies  Another age shall see the golden ear  Imbrown the slope and nod on the parterre  Deep harvests bury all his pride has plann'd  And laughing Ceres reassume the land  Who then shall grace or who improve the soil  Who plants like BATHURST or who builds like BOYLE  'Tis use alone that sanctifies expence  And splendor borrows all her rays from sense  His father's acres who enjoys in peace  Or makes his neighbours glad if he encrease  Whose chearful tenants bless their yearly toil  Yet to their lord owe more than to the soil  Whose ample lawns are not asham'd to feed  The milky heifer and deserving steed  Whose rising forests not for pride or show  But future buildings future navies grow  Let his plantations stretch from down to down  First shade a country and then raise a town  You too proceed make falling arts your care  Erect new
