 A SERMON Preach'd before the ARCHBISHOP Bishops and Clergy OF THE  Province of CANTERBURY  MET IN CONVOCATION At the Cathedral Church of St  Paul  on  Monday February    By  W HAYLEY  DD Dean of  Chichester  Published by Command of His Grace the Archbishop of  Canterbury  Done into  English  from the  Latin  Original By  W JONES  AB  LONDON  Printed for  J Tonson  under  Gray  'sInnGate in  Gray  'sInnLane MDCCI  THE TRANSLATOR TO THE READER  THE following Discourse having been deliver'd in a  Learned Language  to a  Learned  and  Venerable Auditory  and upon a  solemn Occasion  many welldisposed Persons who are not acquainted with the  Latin  Tongue may be curious of knowing what is contained in it For the Satisfaction of These Men and for the sake of those two most desirable Things which are here treated of  Peace  and  Edification  I have ventur'd to hand it into the World in our MotherTongue  W J  A SERMON Preach'd to the CONVOCATION  ROM xiv  Let us follow after the things which make for Peace and things wherewith one may edifie another  THESE Words of St  Paul  recommend two things to us  Peace  and  Mutual Edification  very proper to be discours'd of at this Time as well as to be pursu'd throughout our whole Lives To the  One  we owe whatever is Pleasant and Grateful to us in this Life and to the  Other  all the Happiness we hope to enjoy in the Next  Nor does the Apostle alone join these two together but even God himself and the Nature of Things require such a Connexion For while we live in  Peace  we are more Ready in Finding out more Happy in Executing and more Successful in Promoting those Things that  tend to  Edification  and whilst we study  Edification  Tranquillity of Mind and Brotherly Love flow in of course From hence it seems very evident that he will never attain to either who doth not prosecute Both and that the One can never be true and genuine without the Other That  Peace  is false and impious which obstructs  Edification  and he is not the Servant of  Christ  but of  Satan  who under pretence of  Edification  violates  Peace  For thus St  James  argues  Jam iii  V    Who  says he  is a wise Man and endued with Knowledge amongst you Let him shew out of a good Conversation his Works with Meekness of Wisdom But if ye have bitter Envying and Strife in your Hearts glory not and lie not against the Truth This Wisdom descendeth not from Above but is Earthly Sensual Devilish  That therefore  Peace  and  Edification  should every where and in all Ages of the Church go hand in hand together is highly necessary and our Apostle in this his Epistle to the  Romans  recommends  Both  for a special Reason For the Church planted at  Rome  was then but young and tender its Root not firm and deep and yet was expos'd to the Insults both of  Jews  and  Gentiles  There were in that City several  Weak  Brethren who were not well acquainted with the true Bounds of a  Christian Liberty  V    V    One believed that he might eat all things another who was Weak eat Herbs  And  one Man esteem'd every day alike whilst another esteem'd one day above another  having not as yet sufficiently shaken off the Yoke of the  Mosaical  Dispensation From both these Extreams therefore very dangerous Consequences were to be expected On one side it was to be fear'd lest the better Instructed Christians should by a vain Ostentation of their Liberty draw over the Weaker to do that with which their Conscience could not as yet comply  which could never be consistent with  Edification  Hence the Apostle advises  V    Judge this rather that no Man put a Stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his Brother's Way I know  adds he  and am perswaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of it self But to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him it is unclean But if thy Brother be grieved with thy Meat now walkest thou not Charitably Destroy not him with thy Meat for whom Christ died  The Danger that threatned on the other hand was lest the mutual Contests and Offences arising about these Matters should both disturb the Peace of the Church and give the common Enemy an opportunity of scattering the Flock of Christ For it was very natural for the  Weak  to condemn those as  Sinners  who made use of a Liberty which they look'd upon as Criminal and it was as natural for those who were puff'd up with Knowledge to despise them as  Ignorant  who declin'd that Liberty which they knew to be allowed by Christ himself Now what else would have been the Issue of these Contests but that the Weakerminded would either have return'd back again to  Judaism  or have torn the Church to pieces by Schism And that the Enemies of Christianity would have taken occasion from the Censure which each Party pass'd upon the other to have crush'd them Both cutting off those who made use of their Liberty as being wicked Men by the Testimony of the Weak and oppressing the Weak who in the Judgment of their Brethren were a foolish and inconsiderable sort of People For how mean an Opinion must the Infidels needs have conceiv'd of that Church which by the Confession of Christians themselves was made up of  Ignorant  and  Impious  Persons  Hence it is that St  Paul  as a faithful Minister of Christ and one who regarded the Salvation of Both Parties earnestly exhorts them in the first place to a mutual Forbearance  V    Let every Man  says he  be fully perswaded in his own Mind But why dost thou judge thy Brother or why dost thou set at nought thy Brother every one of us shall give account of himself to God let us not therefore judge one another any more  Then he perswades those who had a right Notion of Christian Liberty  not to put it on as a Cloak of Maliciousness but as the Servants of God  so to temper it with Charity that disregarding Matters of lesser Moment they would chiefly mind those things that promote the Glory of God and the good of Souls After this he tells them that by these Means the Church would gain to it self Protection from God and Goodwill from Men  V    Let not then  says he  your Good be evil spoken of for the Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink but Righteousness and Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God and approved of Men  And then he subjoins the Admonition here in the Text  Let us therefore follow after the things which make for Peace and things wherewith one may edifie another  The Christian Religion through the Goodness of God was planted very early in these  British  Islands And the same good hand of Divine Providence to the Glory of God be it spoken has convey'd it down to us Reform'd in the last Age rescued from imminent Danger in our Times and at present establish'd and in a flourishing Condition These are such Instances of the Divine Favour as cannot be sufficiently acknowledg'd or proclaim'd However the present state of our Church is not so much better than that of the  Roman  in the  Primitive Times but that this Advice of the Apostle may be as applicable to  Us  as it was to those  Romans  The Church of  Rome  has so far departed from the Ancient Doctrine of St  Paul  that having trampled under foot that true Faith for which that Church was formerly so famous throughout the whole World it is now become the bitterest Enemy of our Pure and Primitive Religion Heathen  Rome  it self not being more inveterate against the First Christians than  Christian Rome  with Shame be it spoken is at present against the modern Asserters and Maintainers of that Ancient Faith It seems to be the sole End and Design of the Abetters of that Tyrannical See either to reduce the Purer Churches of Christ to Slavery and Error or else to extirpate them by Conspiracies War and Bloodshed In the mean time into how many Sects and Parties are  We Protestants  crumbled too secure alas under all those Dangers that hang over our Heads With how many Contests and Disputes many of which are of the same nature with those treated of by St  Paul  in this Epistle are we constantly perplexed And all this while the Enemies both of the  Christian  and  Reformed  Religion triumph openly the  One  railing against  Religion  it self as the Source of Contentions and the  Others  arming  Protestants  against one another that so all of them in their turn may at last without the Interposition of Providence fall a Sacrifice to  Roman  Cruelty  Not One of us therefore singly can imploy his private Thoughts and Endeavours better nor can All of us together who are met in this  Venerable Synod  direct our joint Wishes and Counsels to a nobler End than  the following those things which make for Peace and mutual Edification  If we neglect the  Latter  we shall have a Corrupt Church and if we take no Care of the  Former  we shall have a Divided and Weak One or perhaps None at all  Wherefore my main Design at present is to lay before you  Fathers  and  Brethren  these things which are more especially necessary being recommended by the Authority of the Great Apostle that upon a thorough View of their Weight and Value in the Church we may all of us be constantly so far concerned for them as to seek them with our Prayers promote them by our Counsels and prosecute them by our Endeavours And to this End I shall make use only of such Arguments as occur to my Thoughts upon considering the Nature of the Things themselves and the present State of the  Reformed Church  I shall speak first of those that relate to  Peace  and Secondly of such as belong to  Edification  I In discoursing of  Peace  these two Things deserve our particular Enquiry What sort of  Peace  that is which we ought to follow Of what Moment such a  Peace  is our present Circumstances consider'd  I  First  for the right understanding what sort of  Peace  that is which we ought to follow we must distinctly consider with whom it is to be made because the Bonds or Obligations of  Peace  vary according to the Variety of the Persons with whom we are to make it For by how much the closer Men are apt to be united by having the same Countrey or Faith or Discipline so much the more intimate ought to be their Union who have all these things in common provided always that we take care if we meet with any with whom we cannot agree in all things yet we be still ready to agree with them as far as we can following  herein the Apostle's Rule  Phil  Nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same Rule let us mind the same thing  And then 'tis to be hoped that at last  if in any thing we be otherwise minded God shall even reveal this unto us  That there are some even among those who call themselves  Christians  unworthy of  Peace  the Holy Scriptures inform us And these the Apostle both by Precept and Example orders to be cast out of the Church Such for Instance are they who deny the Fundamental Articles of our Faith or who openly allow of Practices contrary to the Christian Profession Of the former kind were  Hymeneus  and  Alexander  Tim  who opposed the Doctrine of the Resurrection and whom St  Paul  himself  delivered unto Satan  Tim  that by being chastiz'd  they might learn not to blaspheme  Of the Latter was that  Corinthian  Teacher who was guilty of Incest whom the Apostle ordered to be punished after the same manner  Cor  Let such an one  I say  be delivered unto Satan for the destruction of the Flesh that the Spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord Jesus therefore put away from among your selves that wicked Person  We have too many of such Christians falsely so called among our selves who not only deny the Resurrection of the Flesh but even that Christ is come in the Flesh who do not acknowledge  Father Son  and  Holy Ghost  the One True God of the Christians in whose Name we were baptized Some we have who take away the Merits and Satisfaction of our Saviour and others who pretend their own are equal to his On one side we meet with those that reject the Authority of the Scriptures on the other with those that make their own Traditions equal with them and impose upon us their private Fictions of Purgatory worshipping of Saints and Images  and the Infallibility of the Pope as Articles of Faith necessary to Salvation Nor is it any Wonder that the  Manners  of these Men are like their  Doctrines  Hence it is that the Church of God has been either rent into Factions or oppress'd by a Tyrannical Power That Magistrates have been divested of their Authority tho' deriv'd to them from God himself That the Innocent have been exil'd tortur'd and put to death And lastly that at the Will and Pleasure of the Bishop of  Rome  Kings have been depos'd the People robb'd of their Laws and Estates and at last massacred But such Doctrines and such Practices can never belong to the Church of God Nor can any Peace be observed with those who teach and avow such things but the utmost Care ought to be taken that the Peace of the Church be not destroyed by their Contrivances  I own indeed that a Christian Charity is to be exercis'd even towards these Men how little soever they may deserve it and that all Methods ought to be us'd to bring them to a better Mind 'Tis the part of a goodnatur'd Man and a Christian Pastor to convince such Persons of their Error to represent the Danger they are in and to admonish exhort and beseech them to return into the right way And such of them who through an invincible Ignorance or the Prejudice of Education or the Craftiness of their Teachers have been so far seduc'd as to do they know not what may lay claim to a gentler sort of Usage Herein we follow the Rule prescribed us by St  Jude  while  Jud v  we save them with Fear plucking them out of the Fire  tho'  hating even the Garment spotted by the Flesh  Nor is it to be denied but that a Man who is a true Christian may in some Cases act in Conjunction with the Enemies  of his Religion as for Instance in Trade Civil Offices the Defence of ones Countrey and the like Neither will it be unbecoming us to carry our selves peaceably towards them in common Conversation and the Affairs of this Life for this will make them sensible that the Reason why we differ from them in Matters of Religion is the Obligation of Conscience and not a Humour of Opposition However they are to be excluded from the Communion of our Church from partaking with us in our Sacraments and from joining with us in our Publick Prayers For neither our Temples nor the Worship of God are to be prophaned by the Enemies of our Religion According to that Precept of the Apostle  Cor  Be ye not unequally yok'd together with Unbelievers for what Fellowship hath Righteousness with Unrighteousness and what Communion hath Light with Darkness And what Concord hath Christ with Belial Or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel  The Apostle therefore does not admonish us to  follow Peace  with those that subvert either the  Faith  or  Manners  of Christians but with such who agreeing with Us in the Fundamentals of Religion are of different Opinions from us in other Matters of lesser moment With these he perswades us to maintain as strict an Union as possible and not to divide into Parties but to stand by one another in a mutual Defence against the common Enemies of Christianity He informs us that such weak Persons as these are to be esteemed as Brethren and that provided the Substance of Religion be secured we should not give way to Passion and Dissention upon the Account of some trivial Differences in Opinions  But because as was hinted before in the same Church some may happen to be united to others with more and closer Ties than ordinary we are to consider what sort of Peace is to be kept according to the Variety of the several Persons with whom it is to be maintained  In the first place then it certainly becomes  Us  who are  Pastors of the same Flock  and  Ministers attending at the same Altar  not only to be united together by the Bonds of  Peace  but by the closest Ties of  Love  and  Affection  By this means we shall be the more firm and constant in opposing the Enemies of our Religion and Function and teach our respective Flocks to demean themselves after the same manner towards All of us as we behave our selves towards one another For what Thoughts would an Atheist or an Infidel or a weaker Christian have of the whole Body of the Clergy if there should scarce be found one among them famous for his Writings his Dignity or the Post he holds in the Church whom some of his Equals do not charge with Ignorance Craft or Impiety And how can it be expected that the People should esteem us as Pious and Faithful Ministers of Christ unless we our selves who 'tis reasonable to suppose should know one another best testifie to the World both by Word and Deed that we have really the same Thoughts of one another  The Church of  England  by the special Providence of God has a double Advantage which the Unhappiness of the Times in the Beginning of the  Reformation  denied to many of our Neighbours The One that  Episcopacy  is preserved among us the Other that our  Ordination  is in all respects perfect and handed down to us from the  Apostles  themselves To testifie how much  we prize the former Advantage let us honour respect and obey our Bishops and that they may govern and protect us with the Affection of  Fathers  let us behave our selves towards them with the Affection and Duty of  Sons  If as it sometimes happens in Human Affairs we should engage in any Controversie with them let us beware lest by any undecent Reflections on their  Persons  we vilifie their  Order  bearing all due Respect to the Dignity of their Station and being fully perswaded that whatever Disgrace is cast upon the  Fathers  will reflect upon the  Sons  And that the Christian World may perceive how highly we value our  Ordination  let us honour and esteem all those who have received the same Holy Orders with our selves Let us imitate our Ancestors on whom the Apostles laid their Hands and let us be animated by the same Spirit of mutual Love with which they were  Rom  being kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly Love in honour preferring one another  as St  Paul  expresses himself So long as we all preach sound Doctrine let us neither envy nor censure those who do it either more or less dexterously than our selves Nor let us account him as an Enemy who when his Belief of what God has revealed to us be the same with ours yet is not so happy as to explain himself exactly in the same Terms with us But above all things this Caution is more especially necessary That when we engage in any Controversie in Divinity we do not come to it with exasperated Minds If any Doubts arise let them be seriously weighed accurately discussed solidly handled and let Truth be established by Dint of Argument not by opprobrious Language But in case as it often happens that neither Party can be convinc'd by the force of the Arguments on the other side it will become them  Both to consider that being Members of a well regulated Church they ought to lay aside all Contention and Reflections and leave the Point in question to be examined and determined by their Superiours In doing thus we shall follow the Apostle's Advice  Eph  Let no Corrupt Communication proceed out of your Mouth but that which is good to the use of Edifying  And again  Let all Bitterness and Wrath and Clamour and Evilspeaking be put away from you with all Malice  For the maintaining sincere Peace among all those who profess themselves Sons of our Church it is necessary that they as Members of the same Body should be so intimately united as both to join with their Pastors and with one another as well in the Publick Worship as in Brotherly Love True it is that the Variety of Customs the several Ways of Living the particular Constitution of our Bodies and the like do occasion Variety of Opinions and different Modes of Acting in divers Instances One is for leading a Life of Austerity whilst another thinks that he may take his Freedom in those things that are innocent Some are for the Exercise of a severer Discipline towards Offenders whilst others would have gentler Methods to be applied Some are of Opinion that it would be best for the Security of the Church if those things that are established already remain as they are and those Persons be kept at a distance from her who are not fully satisfied in every Particular Whilst others on the contrary think it more adviseable that things should be varied according to the Diversity of Times and Occasions That some Allowances should be made to Mens Prejudices and that the Terms of Communion should be enlarged for the Reception of Weaker Brethren into the Bosom  of the Church But in these and such like Instances which are Matters of  Prudence  rather than  Religion  we may easily bear with one another whilst we all hold the same Faith and all make use of the same Prayers Sacraments Worship and Discipline The Church is but little beholden to those Men who are for excluding out of it All that cannot in every thing think as they do and look upon them as Enemies who are not Friends just in their own way Besides there are many things which God has not been pleas'd to reveal to us Several others which perhaps it is our Interest to be Ignorant of and some still wherein we have no Concern on which side the Truth lies In such cases if Men differ in their Opinions it is not to be wonder'd at nor ought any Offence to be taken from thence Such Varieties of Opinions should not divide us into Sects and Parties for the Church suffers no real detriment by them They seem to be too fond of Quarrelling who upon the Account of such trivial Matters violate Brotherly Love and Christian Communion  There are many  Protestant  Churches  Abroad  who hold the same Fundamental Articles of Faith as we do tho' they make use of different Ceremonies and Discipline It were to be wish'd that they were better united among themselves and that All of them were in a closer Union with the Church of  England  than hitherto they have been that so tho' distant one from another in Place and differing in some things yet they might be truly joyn'd together in Christian Peace and Communion It is indeed to be own'd that some of these might rectifie their Sentiments in particular Instances and 'tis matter of great concern that some others of them are so unhappy as to want that  Ecclesiastical  Hierarchy  which has flourish'd down from the Apostle's Times Hence it comes to pass that they commonly decline Communion with one another and if at any time the Members of those Churches happen in the same Places to meet with the Members of our Church they do not without some Difficulty join together in the same External Worship And hence arises that Alienation of Affections that Disunion of Strength and that unsteady Friendship which is to be observed among  Protestants  It would certainly be worth our while and perhaps not unworthy the Thoughts of this Holy Synod to consider how we might all become One Body But by what Means this might be effected what Abatements or Allowances in order thereunto might be made on either Side is not Mine nor any private Man's Province to determine only thus much we may be allow'd to wish that for the Honour of the  Christian  and the safety of the  Reform'd  Religion such an Union may some time be brought about and that God in his Mercy would teach all the  Protestant Churches  in general  Luk xix  to know at least in this their Day the things that belong to their  mutual  Peace before they be hid from their Eyes  that so at length that Reproach may be remov'd which is so often cast upon us by the  Romanists  of our not being the  Sons of Peace  who cannot tell how to agree even among our selves and that other Means proving ineffectual we may at last be instructed by our Misfortunes with Brotherly Love and united Force to defend one another against the Subtilty and Power of the Common Enemy or if at any time which God prevent the same Calamity should overtake any other of the Reformed Churches which has in our days befal'n the  French  that in such case the Dispers'd and Exil'd Brethren  may by a Communion both in  Temporals  and  Spirituals  find their own  Country  and  Church  in every  Protestant  Region into which they come  But the most difficult Question is still behind  viz  What sort of Peace is to be maintain'd with those who having the same Country Laws and Religion in common with us yet for some Reasons not proper to be enquired into at present are dissatisfied with our  Discipline  or our  Liturgy  and upon that account divide into Parties choose themselves Pastors and form themselves into separate Communions Their Case is different from that of the  Foreign Protestants  these Latter would have been glad of our Church Government if they could have had it at least they do not condemn it they are at liberty to use their own Customs and Ceremonies whilst the Former withdraw themselves from the Pastors of their own Church and oppose that Discipline which is established by Lawful Authority  We do indeed maintain some sort of Peace with these for no open War or Persecution is carry'd on against them And herein the truly laudable Charity and Moderation of the  Church of England  is made manifest to the Christian World that constant Pains are taken by Preaching Writing and Conference to satisfie the Weaker of them And Matters are manag'd with so much Gentleness towards our  Dissenting Brethren  that without exasperating their Minds we chuse rather to gain them over into a willing Compliance with  the Meekness of Wisdom  and yet there are still remaining separate Congregations distinct Pastors and a different sort of Discipline However it does not seem adviseable or Christianlike to cast off so great a Body of our People as lost and undone That they are not  as yet past reclaiming is the Opinion of Many good Men and that they may be reclaim'd is the hearty desire of All Let us therefore put up our Constant Petitions to the Father of Lights that he would at last vouchsafe to open their Eyes that they may see what a gross Error they lie under with what a deep Wound they tear and weaken the Church and what encouragement they give to our Common Enemies by their Separation  Nor ought we to despair but still to add our farther Endeavours that at one time or other this so Pious and Beneficial a Design may be accomplish'd The happy Day may come which may produce what an Age has deny'd us and at last a Way be open'd to us whereby we may satisfie the Scruples of the Dissenters without prejudicing the Doctrine Authority or Discipline of the Church and they may return into the Bosom of their Mother after too long an Alienation from her Than which nothing certainly could be more desirable to a Christian or more fortunate to this Church Then we should have perfect and entire Peace among our selves which is at present so lamentably broken and disturb'd by separate Assemblies and mutual Jealousies  It is not my present Business to enquire by what Methods this most desirable Peace may be obtain'd This is to be left to the Piety and Prudence of this Venerable Synod under the Divine Conduct of the Spirit of Peace and the Author of Concord whenever they shall think fit to enter upon the Consideration of these weighty Concerns Having thus shewn what sort of Peace is to be follow'd and with whom all that remains under this Head is to excite you to  a vigorous Prosecution of it which I cannot do better than by desiring you according to my proposed Method  II To observe of what great Moment this  Peace  is to us our present Circumstances consider'd Now 'tis of so great Moment that almost the Whole of Religion depends upon it nor can it rationally be expected according to the present State of Affairs that we should long have any Church at all but by the means of Unity and Peace For the confirmation of this among many other Arguments which the time does not permit me to run through I shall only produce these Four  The Church of  Rome  most implacable to Protestants has never shewn her self more eager in contriving our Ruin both by secret Conspiracies and open Force than at this time I need not tell you what Fury it has exercis'd against Some nor what Arts it makes use of against Others of the  Reformed Churches  these things are but too manifest to every one who reads any thing of the Transactions of  Europe  In  France  in  Bearne  and in  Piedmont  the very Name of  Protestant  is almost extinct every Day we hear of many in those Places condemn'd to Prisons to Gallies and to Tortures the rest who have made their Escape are reduc'd to live upon Charity and compell'd to seek new Places of Abode either here or elsewhere Nor are we ignorant of the Danger which threatens the Protestants of the  Palatinate Hungary  and  Transylvania  By these Disasters we have lost Some of the Reformed Churches and from these Dangers we are in fear for Others And if once the Ruin of those Remoter  Churches shall be totally accomplish'd This of ours will become an easie Prey to the Tyranny of  Rome  Nor can we otherwise be safe unless with united Force we make so vigorous an Opposition as to let our Enemies know that whilst they exercise their Cruelty towards our Brethren we look upon it as if done to our selves  That such a  Peace  and intimate Union among  Protestants  is highly necessary is what hardly any one can be insensible of but some perhaps will be apt to suspect that now 'tis too late and so it is to be fear'd it will be if in such a weighty Concern we do not take some early Care Let us then be prevail'd upon without delay to do our Part towards the attaining of this End that by being at Peace among our selves we may open a Way to an  Universal Peace  If ever by the Providence of God the Churches Abroad should unite one may very fairly suppose that such a Thing would hardly be done but by the Mediation of the Church of  England  but how shall others make use of our Counsels for the Composing their Differences if we can find out no Remedy to our own  Gal v  All the Law  as the Apostle speaks and all our Safety  is fulfilled in one Word Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self but if  instead of mutual Love  we bite and devour one another let us take heed that we be not consumed one of another  and all of us together by our Common Enemy  Matt xii  For every Kingdom divided against it self is brought to Desolation and every City or House divided against it self shall not stand  The  Faith  it self is endanger'd by mutual Contentions and whilst warm Debates and angry Disputes are carry'd on among Brethren about the Punctilio's of  Religion the Blow really tho' not designedly falls upon Religion it self It often happens that they who believe one and the same Article of Faith do differ in their manner of explaining it and whilst Both are pleas'd with their own Explanation One contends that it cannot be True in the others way of Expressing it and the other that it must be true his way or not at all in the mean time the Enemies of Religion borrowing Arguments from each Party do infer that it must be certainly False and cannot be at all Thus whilst some contend about the Shadow they occasion others to lose the Substance It would certainly be much better when the Substance of our Doctrine is the same to be less solicitous about other Matters for whilst we are agreed in those things which God himself teaches it is not becoming either a Modest Man or a Christian to contend eagerly about his own Illustrations Let the Enemies of our Faith rather perceive that we aim not at our Own but at the Glory of God and that we never fall out with those who together with our selves embrace the Scripture Revelation upon the account of our own private Opinions  But from these Contentions if they happen among Pastors themselves a farther danger arises to the Faith For we know that Religion is planted increases and flourishes by their Care and Labours and that the greater esteem Men have for them the more easily will they be perswaded by them Now if they themselves charge each other with Ignorance and Error what else can be the Issue but that the People mov'd by these Reflections will despise or hate them and by degrees fall from despising the Pastor to contemn Religion it self It would certainly be more adviseable for Both Sides to consult their Mutual Honour and Reputation  and if there should be a Mistake in any case to conceal it rather than by exposing the Weakness of particular Persons to frustrate the Success of their common Endeavours  Unless we maintain  Peace  farewel to Discipline and GoodManners without which the Church cannot stand long for whilst Factions prevail Justice for fear it should seem to be severer on one side than the other is apt to proceed too timerously and ill Men either conceal their Vices in the Mist of Contention or if they be too manifest to be conceal'd then they shelter 'em by their Zeal for one of the contending Parties Whilst the Quarrel on both Sides is manag'd with an immoderate Heat neither Party examines of what Life or Faith the Men of their own Side are but only how they stand affected towards the Party Nor is there any concern whether they be Good Men or no but only whether they be on our Side But if these Contentions are heighten'd into Schisms the Case is still worse for then the worst of Men even the Corrupters of our Faith and Manners by leaving one Communion for another as occasion serves equally escape the Censure of all But what sort of Manners can we expect where there is no Discipline and what sort of Face is the Church like to have when 'tis stain'd with corrupt Manners How valuable soever a pure Faith is yet a pure Life will be always brighter and more esteem'd Vices pollute the Soil in which they grow nor will any Church preserve its Honour whose Members are  Christians  by  Name  but  Infidels  in  Practice  Peace therefore is to be follow'd that we may prosecute Vice and Friendship maintain'd among Good Men that we may turn our whole Force against Impiety an Enemy  both to the Salvation of our Souls and to the Peace of the Church For neither can a Church flourish or be secure unless Care be taken of Mens Manners nor can there be any Regulation of Manners unless Peace be preserv'd  By the Loss of  Peace  we together with it lose  Edification  For there is no room for Perswasion in the midst of Heat and Passion Nor do those whose Minds are possest with the Prejudices of contending Parties easily attend to him that preaches Faith in Christ or Piety towards God or the Love of Vertue When Passion is laid the Understanding is more apt to receive the Truth and the Will is the more easily moved by the weight of Arguments If one side is angry so is the other nor does either of them consider what becomes Themselves but what may prejudice their Adversaries There is therefore need of Peace both for the Planting Faith in our Minds and also for promoting the Fruits of Faith Integrity of Life and the Care of our Souls Conformable to this is what we meet with in Scripture  Act ix  Then had the Churches rest throughout all  Judea  and  Galilee  and  Samaria  and were edified and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost were multiplied  Whilst we enjoy the Gentle Gale of Peace Unbelievers are easily perswaded to embark in the same Bottom with us if we are driven to and fro by our Differences they had rather be at quiet in their own Errors than be toss'd about by our Contentions Nor can the Church it self in the midst of perpetual Storms hold out always against the Violence of the Waves It must sometimes come into Port to refit it will want frequent Repair to secure it from Shipwreck and the Care and Vigilance of the  Builder  must be constantly  employed for its Safety and Preservation And this brings me to the other General Head of my Discourse  viz  To treat of the  Edification  of the Church  II This  Edification  has a regard to two things  Faith  and  Manners  both of them absolutely necessary to our Salvation We have already seen that whilst we follow Peace we take the wisest Course to secure both our  Faith  and  Manners  but it still remains under this Head of  Edification  that we enquire how much it is our Interest to take care of these things and by what other Methods they may be preserv'd and maintained  I As to  Faith  the more it is in Danger the greater Care ought to be taken of it But hardly in any Age of the Church have we heard of more Shipwrecks made of the Faith than are to be seen in our Days To call in question the Doctrines of the Gospel to throw aside all Revelation as a Cheat nay to deny the Existence of God or which amounts to the same thing to disown his Providence is grown so fashionable that those who openly do so are no longer as formerly they were looked upon as Monsters That only is reckoned Liberty to think not what is most probable but what every one has the most mind to Every Man sets up his own private Opinion for his Religion and 'tis reckoned a Meanness of Spirit to suffer ones self to be directed by the Word of God and the Light of Revelation  n so corrupt a State of things it is somewhat Heroical to be inspired with the Warmth of  Elijah  and while almost all the House of  Israel  follow after  Baal to be very jealous for the Lord God of Hosts  Kin  Patiently to suffer so many Souls in Danger To be fainthearted or to permit the Lord's Vineyard to be trodden under Foot of wild Beasts this I say is a false way of following Peace Our Force and Courage is rather to be rallied under such an imminent Danger and it will be our Duty as becomes the Soldiers of Christ to find out attempt and execute to the utmost of our Power whatever may reduce Men to a sounder Mind and to the Communion of the Church  For the more remiss we are in defending the  Faith  the more will the Enemies and Corrupters of our Religion exalt themselves the more securely will Satan the Betrayer of Man's Salvation sow his Tares in the Field of  Christ  and it may be at last just with God in Judgment to take away from us that Faith which we have been so negligent in keeping and the Light of the Gospel being removed to suffer this ungrateful Nation to fall back again into the Darkness of  Infidelity  or  Popery  But that we may escape such an unspeakable Calamity having called upon God for his Assistance that he would be pleased to enlighten those who are in Error with the Grace of his Holy Spirit  In the first place we must endeavour by Conference by Perswasion  Tim  by preaching the Word by being instant in season out of season by reproving rebuking exhorting with all longsuffering and Doctrine  to convince the Erroneous and reclaim them to the Truth  We must endeavour to return such Answers to the Corrupt Books which wicked Men disperse abroad as may at once shew our Temper and their Fallacies detect their Errors instruct our Flock and defend Religion How successfully this was done in the late Times when  Popery  was growing upon us and upon other Occasions we have found by Experience to the great Honour of our Clergy and to the Good of the Church  We should very plainly and clearly in our Discourses from the Pulpit explain the Articles of our Faith to the People prove them out of the Scriptures themselves and constantly teach of what use these Doctrines are in this and how much they conduce to the Happiness of the other Life  We should take care as far as in us lies to encourage the setting up of Schools wherein the Poorer Youth may be taught to read the Bible and to understand the first Rudiments of Religion and to retain them in their Memory  That those of riper Years be more fully instructed in order to their being confirmed by the Benediction of the Bishop  Pet  That they may be ready always to give an Answer to every Man that asketh them a Reason of the Hope that is in them  And that they may not for want of a solid Foundation be born down by the Attempts of Deceivers  Eph  nor be any more Children tossed to and fro and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine by the slight of Men and cunning Craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive  And all these things by the Blessing of God are generally practised among us both to the Good of Souls and the Honour of this Church One thing is still to be wish'd and how it might be obtained I leave to the Judgment and Prudence of my Superiours  viz  that some Method may be found out whereby all those who are Eminent for their Birth Station or Wealth may be obliged to instill betimes these important Matters into the Minds of their Children and to instruct them throughly as they grow up in the Christian Religion to teach them what the Articles of our Faith are on what Foundations they are built and by what Arguments defended against Atheists Hereticks and Infidels For the Rise and Growth of our Misfortune is chiefly owing to this that these young Gentlemen except some few on whom the Care of their Parents or the Discipline of an University bestow a more happy Education neglecting the Business of Religion conform themselves to the Manners of the Age and being furnished with a little humane Learning or rendred more confident by a Smattering in Philosophy think it genteel to doubt of Sacred Truths to laugh at Revelation and to form each for himself a new or no Religion as the Fancy takes him From these the Infection descends to the People for they are the Persons whom when  young  those of the same Age imitate and whom when  grown up  All Men make their court to God grant that some suitable Remedy may be applied to this Unhappiness that Religion may not be run down chiefly by those who are more indebted to God than others by whose Authority the Vulgar ought to  be kept within the Bounds of their Duty and by whose Example they should be taught to lead regular Lives and to reverence things Sacred  II The Second and withal the most necessary Part of  Edification  is that which relates to  Manners  For let our Faith be never so Sound and Orthodox if in our Manners we act counter thereto our Church will never be esteemed as truly Christian All Men cannot pretend to judge of Opinions but all may be Judges of our Lives The wiser sort may perhaps come over to us for the sake of Truth but to win over the Vulgar we must adorn the Purity of our Doctrine by Integrity of Life 'Tis true indeed in the Reformation of Manners we are to struggle with a very corrupt Age But the more corrupt the Age is the more Occasion is there for us to endeavour in the first Place that things may not grow worse and then that they may alter for the better Nor can we bestow our Pains on a Work more acceptable to God more becoming our selves or more beneficial to our Flocks The Church of  England  was reformed by our Ancestors from the Corruptions of  Popery  in Matters of  Faith  How much will it be for our Glory to be instrumental in transmitting it down to Posterity purg'd at last from a  Practice  unsuitable to its  Doctrine  But that these our Attempts may meet with a happy Issue Endeavours ought to be used  That  Ecclesiastical Discipline  may be restored that we may obtain this Favour at least of the Secular  Power that they would not weaken but rather strengthen our Hands whilst they are employed in promoting the Publick Safety For the Corruption which we labour under both in  Faith  and  Manners  is to be imputed to the Loss of our Discipline  That we procure as far as may be good Laws to be enacted against publick and scandalous Vices especially and that such Men may be afraid of the Civil Sword who do not stand in awe of the Censure of the Church  That Magistrates be excited to add Life to the Laws already in force against ill Manners by putting them into Execution that they may not by their Remissness suffer Vice to grow headstrong whilst the Remedy grows weak  That we constantly shew the People the Necessity of a Holy Life in our Discourses Writings and Preaching and fully convince them that there is no hope of Pardon without a sincere Repentance nor any way to Salvation but by Holiness of Life  I shall add only this one thing more which is of the highest Importance That the Clergy would by their Examples give Life and Strength to all these things and stir up the People committed to their Charge by shewing that themselves are concerned for these weighty Matters not only in their Preaching but in their Hearts and Practice Nothing will  have a greater Influence upon the Common People to incline them to perform all the Parts of a good Life  Piety  towards God  Obedience  towards the King  Justice  and  Charity  towards their Neighbours and  Sobriety  and  Modesty  towards themselves than the perceiving that all these Duties are not only recommended by the Discourses of their Pastors but visibly proposed to our Imitation in their Lives and Actions  Let me therefore  Reverend Fathers  and  Brethren  Exhort you I do not say to do these things for I am fully perswaded that this is your constant Practice and I make no question but your Flocks will readily acknowledge it but rather that you would be earnest in your Prayers to God that all these things may be constantly and stedfastly performed both by our selves and through the Influence of our Example by the whole Body of the Clergy  That our  Piety  may be eminently conspicuous to our Flocks through all the Parts of the Sacred Ministry that in celebrating the Publick Prayers in the Administration of the Sacraments in preaching the Word of God and in all the other Divine Offices we may demean our selves with so much Care Gravity and Diligence as may make it appear that we have always God in our view that we make his Glory our only Aim and that as becomes faithful Ministers of Christ we look upon no Labour and Vigilancy too much that is bestowed in the taking care of Souls  That we still may preserve that Reputation of  Loyalty  towards our  King  for which the Church of  England  has been so famous throughout the whole World We do not find in all our History that God ever bless'd us before with a Prince who deserv'd more of the Reform'd Religion in General and of our Church in Particular May there not be met with in the Annals of Posterity any Instance of a more grateful and Dutiful Clergy We are sufficiently sensible of the Envy of ill Men and have found by Experience that there are some who would have us pass for suspected Persons and such as have not a steady affection for the Government Let us by an openhearted Loyalty and Obedience stop the Mouths of these Malicious Persons and let it appear that they are only the Enemies of Religion it self who calumniate the Ministers of our Religion as defective in their Love Affection and Duty to their Prince  That we may recommend  Justice  and  Mutual Love  to our People it is to be wish'd that we may always demean our selves justly and affectionately one towards another that we who are  Sons  may be ready to pay all due Obedience and Honour to our  Fathers in Christ  and that the  Fathers  themselves may not oppress those who are under them but govern them with Kindness and Lenity  Pet v  Not as being Lords over God's Heritage but being ensamples to the Flock  That if at any time it shall happen that we meet and consult together in one Body Matters may be discussed calmly and deliberately without Noise or Clamour and that it may be evident that the sole Good of the Church not  any private disgust does influence our Debates And that whilst we act separately in our ordinary Stations we may always be so far united in mutual Kindness Affection and Assistance that our  Hearts  may conspire in finding out and our  Hands  be ready to join in executing whatever conduces to the Honour of God and the Salvation of Souls    Lastly  Let us beseech God that he would vouchsafe to grant us All the special Grace of his Holy Spirit that Sobriety Modesty Temperance and the Contempt of Worldly Things may shine forth in us that our Flocks may be convinced that we are heartily solicitous about our own Souls and are not overfond of this World whilst we preach to them of another to come but that  Cor  We bring into Subjection our Bodies  and Desires  lest that by any Means when we have preached to others we our selves should be Castaways  Let us walk before them with such uprightness of Manners and Sanctity of Life that they may say that  God is in us of a Truth  Such Manners will give weight to our Sermons and Counsels By this Means whatever we jointly decree will carry its Authority whatever we publickly Preach will have its Force and whatever private Admonitions we give will be accompanied with a pleasing sort of Command over the Minds of Men By such an Example as This we shall truly edifie the  Church  render it flourishing in our Times and durable to afterAges and every one of us after the finishing of his Pious Labours in the Lord's Vineyard shall close his Days with the same Consolation wherewith our Holy Apostle St  Paul  says that he supported himself  Tim  I have fought a good Fight I have finish'd my Course I have kept the Faith Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness which the Lord the Righteous Judge shall give me at that Day  To whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost The One True and Eternal God be Praise and Glory for ever and ever  Amen  FINIS
