 TRAVELS FOR THE HEART VOL I  TRAVELS FOR THE HEART WRITTEN IN FRANCE BY COURTNEY MELMOTH IN TWO VOLUMES VOL I  LONDON PRINTED FOR JOHN WALLIS No LUDGATESTREET  TO THE HEART OF HIS EXCELLENCY LORD STORMONT AMBASSADOR AT THE COURT OF FRANCE THESE TRAVELS ARE INSCRIBED BY HIS MOST DEVOTED MOST OBEDIENT AND MOST OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT  THE AUTHOR  PREFACE  THE motive by which I am urged to write a Preface to this little book of running remarks is chiefly to enter a caveat against a charge which precipitate readers may be pleased to bring against it upon account of my having admitted  trifles  that at first sight seem not worthy so much notice  This certainly I should not have done had I not been fully persuaded that these very trifles light airy and unsubstantial as they appear more forcibly mark a character develope an action however entangled by circumstances and serve as a clue to unfold the mazes of the heart than any of those elaborate performances which have for their objects the mighty the marvellous and the magnificent  Those who have at any time done me the honour to make my former writings a part of their amusement will see and recollect that I was long ago of this opinion and as I grow older in the world and more experienced in its manners I have still greater reason to imagine it is solidly founded  Were not long prefaces a large evil the defence of what appear to be  trifles  in literature and in  life might lead into a pleasing speculation But this is in part unnecessary as many sentiments on this very subject are interwoven into the body of the book itself a few  others  however press upon me just now to introduce them and the reader is therefore invited to receive them courteously  In calling to mind a concise list of the most celebrated of those writers who justly reflect so much credit on the genius of the country to which after all migrations of  business of pleasure and of curiosity I shall return with joy as to the dear soil of my nativity I find they are indebted for the lustre of their literary character rather to the art of embellishing trifles than to any formal description of the great the grand or the extraordinary  But this does not arise entirely as some might suspect from the superficiality of the age which is said to take a delight in unimportant publications nor does it proceed  from want of depth in the genius of the writer On the contrary it is in both cases rather a matter for compliment than of censure The proof of this requires no sophistry but lies upon the surface open to every man's observation That which is too obvious and very many things are so requires only a halfglance of the most lacklustre eye to be discovered For instance the spacious building the stupendous mountain which seems ambitious of Heaven the castle whose emulous spire cleaveth  the clouds the forest which fills the eye as far as it can sweep and the appearance of an huge metropolis like that of London Constantinople or Paris taken on the expanded scale with all their towers hospitals palaces and public buildings are objects too unweildy to be missed insomuch that he who is not wont to observe must perforce run his nose against them Thus things which are seen too plainly are seen by every body and scarce regarded by any body A citizen of London who hath many  years resided in that metropolis shall survey such a prodigious object as St Paul's and a native of Paris look upon the Louvre and slightly tell you that they are superb edifices and the admiration of the world but these praises are indeterminate and make no durable impressions Now were we to take these two citizens into the body of these separate buildings and imagine one of them to be an organist and one a painter they would discover their profession and their hearts in five minutes The organist  would sound the keys of the instrument and with the ear of a connoisseur be either pleased or pained as it happened to be in or out of tune and the painter would execrate a picture for bearing marks and almost imperceptible touches of awkwardness although a common person by looking at the picture and hearing the organ would say of the first that it was beautiful and of the second that it was harmonious The reason is that the heart is generally in love with  its old habits and artists attend to the minutiae  But what in my opinion makes more against those ostensible and glaring facts which look us full in the face is that it is impossible from the very nature of their public situation upon the globe that they should be favourable either to industry or to ingenuity They afford scope neither to genius labour imagination nor the heart and without there is somewhat of heart beating briskly through every  undertaking whether it be of the pen or pencil I leave you to judge if it must not be all poverty stagnation stupidity and wretchedness Destitute of the animating vibrations of that most enchanting machinery which is every hour shifting the scene in our bosom every thing must of necessity be sordid dull dispirited  Like the earth in the absence of that sun who is now darting his ray vertically over my head vegetation is enwrapped in gloom and for the  time being a garden is the very last thing in the world into which one would go for good spirits  Now without relying on the gaiety of this simile which is made on Mayday when every body knows similes vegetate so fast that they can almost make themselves without any assistance from the author without I say depending on this Maybush of a simile it is I conceive clearly deduceable from the preceding sentiments in plain prose that it is the heart which informs  inspires and animates all literature that all its powers properties propensities and passions are best seen by penetrating into its recesses that it is the business of a moral writer to take it as it were by surprise while at one moment it is beating with apprehension struggling at another with concealed anxiety throbbing with expectation trembling with fear or panting with hope that little is to be known by taking a man's mind in the lump We should follow the example of surgeons who think  nothing of his body while they are only gazing upon it as an entire carcase We should take up the incisionpen call the utmost keenness into our eye and begin to dissect and to dismember a thousand curious turnings difficult labyrinths and critical meanders various as the veins and twined into branchings equally multiplied are all to be noted by him who looks at his subject especially when that subject is the human heart in an unsuspicious moment  When the heart on the contrary is dressed our for great actions which are to be done in the eye of the world the whole matter is  premeditated  and the heart is in that case in the situation of a stageplayer who sits deliberately down to his lookingglass to assume for the hour that he is to strut precisely that sort of gesture which suits his character but then these gestures form no part of the actor's private disposition which although it is now the representative of every  amiable quality may possibly when the robes of the theatre are laid aside be deformed by all that is odious and contemptible I would no more form any conclusions of either the goodness or badness of a man's heart from his doing any particular business before twenty spectators supposing him to have had a week's or even a day's  preparation  in which time if he is not an ideot he certainly may be perfect in his part be it what it will than I would pretend to determine of a woman's beauty or ugliness  whose face is covered with a veil Faces like hearts are so differently formed that  under a veil  there is no possibility of seeing the truth That fine rubied tint that seems to glow in the cheek may for ought I can tell be the blush of nature or the brush of art the clearness that appears to adorn the complexion may be the true transparency of beauty or  tout au contraire  it may be a kind of white powder more poisonous than arsenic Those gentle sinkings moreover which look beneath this umbrage like  the beds of the dimples may be those horrid pits which have been dug in the cheek by the smallpox In short as soul and body very often club together to carry on any farce for which they are prepared I wholly renounce any sort of sagacity when I look at them in such situations It is like a naked man fighting two others armed capapee No it is from quiet unlookedfor minute surveys and those upon little circumstances in which men are little guarded as thinking that they betray nothing  it is from watching the lucky crisis and catching it up as the golden opportunity to pry into those nooks corners and byeplaces of the heart that are incautiously left open that its true state must be ascertained to the hundreth part of a vibration  Many of our English writers have rested their fame on the swell of heroic actions and on the pomps of those gigantic circumstances which belong to them Such exhibitions while they are yet new arrest the  streams of life in their progress and give exactly that sort of stupendous sensation which strikes us upon suddenly lifting the eye to a prodigious ridge of rocks or pile of buildings especially if the latter should happen to be ornamented with all the great strokes of sculpture and oversized figures such as mice bigger than men and men larger than elephants we open the mouth and declare it is very extraordinary but presently nature is weary of such disproportions and we turn from them to the  minutiae from the exactitude of which we can draw our inferences with accuracy and precision Let it be taken into consideration however that when the eye hath once ached at gratifying its astonishment upon these occasions it will not risk a second pain There is no recompense so that after the first sally the circulation proceeds in its usual course without ever again exciting an emotion either of pleasure or of pain  Other authors have rejected the mighty and monstrous for the trifling and minute  From those who stand foremost in the British list amongst the moderns we find the names of Fielding and Sterne These drew figures from the life Like true and impartial painters they considered the heart exactly as it was every feature they faithfully preserved They dealt in the most delicate facts they followed their  object from the street from the theatre and from bustling societies into his own house they watched the process of his afterreflections his conduct to servants children wife connections they looked at his heart in the moment of success and in that immediately after disappointment They regarded not the meagre description of houses towers turrets steeples or fortifications in the gross but they separated one part from another they discriminated they divided subdivided united and lastly having  patiently marked the smaller actions they were able to pronounce with certainty of the greater till in the end the truth of the whole became evident and distinguishable  For my own part I have here written travels which I wholly dedicate to the reader's  heart  No one hath ever travelled in the same way but the pathetic Yorick and Yorick hath by no means exhausted the observations to be picked up in a tour through France I put my name to these little volumes with  equal pleasure and confidence because every page in them was written in the ardour of relating some event which really happened and the true impressions  of the heart  are given in every sentence  To obviate all objection that might arise from the notion of the  idea  of these volumes being borrowed from that beautiful work called The Sentimental Journey it is requested that the reader will  peruse  the performance before he  judges  of it and then he will find that the very  PLAN of these Travels and those of Yorick agree in no part so much as that they were both written to  amuse the heart  and with  a design to be printed  SUMMARY OF CONTENTS OF VOL I  PREFACE  CONTAINS remarks on what are commonly called  trifles  Proofs brought of their importance in all

of temptation when he thinks fit to make it the end of the first volume of these  Travels for the Heart  P  TRAVELS FOR THE HEART  THE AUTHOR's CASE  THE finger and thumb of my physician who is of the people called Quakers were applied affectionately to my right wrist  I could see by his eyes he did not like the vibrations they anticipated  by two or three sagacious turns of the pupil the alarms of his heart  "The irregularity and skiey influences of this country said he the damps and dews drizzlings and drippings of this realm of vapours will not do for thee Thou canst not humour their caprices"  "Now France continued he France with all her balmy breezes the hilarity of her chearful childrenthe resisting spirit of joy which they profess to repel the invasions of that disconsolation which would otherwise seise upon the heartand  the attracting novelties of a journey so salient and undertaken at a season of the year in which a blossom is peeping from almost every bush to salute theeFrance I say whose patient sons and lighthearted daughters like thy own philosopher Lemuel  A character in the sixth Volume of LIBERAL OPINIONS  always take things as they find themsuch an excursion to such a country might  The prolixity of this advice first shewing me the object and then artfully adorning it now tempting my curiosity and now  firing my fancy did the business ten times better than all the downright persuasions in the world In truth advice of every kind is  physical  and must before it can be received without disgust be purged of its natural bitterness smoothed softened and prepared with the most delicate skill of composition  The dose now gently administered by my physician was perfectly palatable It was made up by one of the best and gentlest of the human race and as a proof that I discovered nothing of the  medicinal  in it which whether in cathartics  of the soul or body are equally hateful and recoiling I was so eager to take it off hand that I interrupted him towards the close of his sentence and prematurely drew the inference from a competent knack which belongs to me of translating his looks  I am positive my translation was true to the letter and sense of the original for as my physician talked upon the benefits of a tour to the Continent there were so many points symptomatic of his meaning that any man very moderately skilled in physiognomy must have interpreted correctly The symptoms  were these a sparkling eye an expanded brow brightened features and over his face particularly in the center of the cheeks that gentle diffusion of blood which is the genuine tincture of a pleasure streaming from the heart and characterises the moment of entire complacency  Entering therefore into the spirit of translation I drew my conclusion in the following mannerFrance you would say assisted by her train of salutary airs songs serenades and dances might restore nature to her healthy tone again There you imagine I might breathe a more  benignant temperature there reestablish that shattered system of the nerves which has long been subjected to the whimsical shocks of a less genial element  He was still pressing his thumb gently upon the artery  "The very idea of this excursion said he hath been friendly to the pulsations of this little pendulum of lifeIts movements approximate much more to what they should be than before thou wert journeying in imagination  Thy case is purely hypochondriacal France knows nothing of these disorders"  "I will set off directly said I one ounce of that health which I originally enjoyed turns the tremblings of the balance against all the mines that are enclosed within the bowels of the earth Ah invaluable treasure thou who givest fresh lustre to the beams of the sun and fresh radiance to the skies of Heavenwho bestowest a more balmy odour on the breath of morning and deepeneth the richness of that tincture which flushes over  the roseAh Health thou prime source of pleasure and vivifying soul of every felicity beneath the moonfor thee and thy inspiring influence I would travel were I assured of meeting thy rewarding smiles into the heart of the most uncheary and unpeopled climes Instead of going forth amidst the fragrancies and fertilities of France I would be contented to pursue thy footsteps through the burning shores of Africa or through the depth of those sterile regions which deform Arabia With what a fervent alacrity doth the sick man leave even his velvet couch and downy pillow to court those breezes and those vales  however distant and obscure which thou deignest to frequent No desert can long deserve that name or long remain barren which is honoured by thy radiating presence Wherever thou journeyest plenty and pleasure are thy harbingers the thorn is softened to a flower and from the barren rock issues at thy bidding the most copious streams of running water In thy train are all the graces and the gayest assemblage of those enchanting ideas which those graces inspire Imagination fancy poesy and every power belonging to her divine and ingenious sisters are thine They describe sing design paint and regulate  their seperate arts each allied to the other only under thy immediate auspices  If then thou art to be found oftener in the kingdoms of Louis of Bourbon than of George of Britain I rise with all the strength and energy that nature hath left me to carry this person nearer to the Seine With the blessings of health come spontaneously the blessings of correcter remarkthe eye acquires a clearer light of its objectthe intellect is cleansed of those cloudy films which before entangled itand the ways of mentheir mannersand their hearts are more easily read and  more easily written uponIn short the longer I contemplate this journey the more comforts shall I find arising from it and so to cut short the whole matter by one decisive sentenceI will set off for Dover this very evening  Nothing could possibly be a stronger testimony of genuine goodnature than what was now exhibited by my physician who with incredible temper sat out my apostrophe and I doubt not would have suffered me to figure away uninterruptedly had I gone on to the last tick of the twelfth hour although he held in his hand and  once or twice put to his ear one of those machines which reminds every man how much time remains for him to do his business Apostrophies however and more especially where imagination is invited to dress up and trick out any amiable images are too delightful to admit any thing that diminishes their loveliness or robs them of the beauty which they acquire from ornamental personification  If I were not in a violent hurry to get forward in my journey I could here say a great many things on the art of personifying and apostrophising but as these points  may perhaps come in sufficiently apropos in any other part of these travels which I hope  so  to write as to make the heart of every reader of every sex and complexion go willingly along with me whether I lead him first to the confines of France from thence to the foot of the Pope and then onward as far as foot either of man or horse can journey I shall rest contented at present with first noteing that in these cases when a man warms in his apostrophewhenmoreover he kindles in the course of personifying an object so attracting as the goddess of health all human things around him are for the time being  compleatly annihilated and the apostrophiser obliviates every article in the place where his  body  happens to behis soul is on the wingwhether those articles are of wood or stone or brick or mortar or flesh or blood  My physician recollecting the happiness I was enjoying in these brisk sallies of the imagination and well aware of the fine activity in which all the vessels that either feed or are fed by the heart were voluptuously regaled sat quiet and when I finished examined once more the flutterings of the pulse after which ceremony being the  third of the same sort he left me with an assurance that I had only to think myself happy and to be so for that he cordially congratulated me on safely dismounting after so successful a gallop through the plains of fancyHe stopped however and turned short round as he got to the door just to beg of me not to use the whip and spur with too much energy at first setting off since it was easy to perceive if I went on upon the stretch as I began all the terra firma as well as all the water in the universe must be overtraversed after a few airings and I should get to the end of the world  ideally  before I had  according to the slow order of  actual  travel turned round my chaise and first given the gehew  THE CABINET  A NEW scheme aptly projected and in the right moment is as the morning sun which brighteneth more and more unto the perfect day From the time it takes possession fancy begins the business of decoration and mixes up her most beautiful colours with the nicest art and ingenuity Every body who hath either a head to conceive or a heart to feel can tell fancy is a fine though a flattering painter but then her portraits like those of the artist who pleased everybody become  delightful from the delicacy of certain adulatory touches which throw an air of complacency into them so that it is impossible for any one to be disgusted but those surly and sordid mortals who are only to be satisfied by the downright fulllength drawings of reason an artist who piques herself upon etching correctly from the life but whose pictures nevertheless like the unseasonable truths which run at random from the lips of blunt and illbred people offend even from their very accuracy Fancy on the contrary softens the rigid and improves the elegant At least she was now in the humour to oblige  in the greatest degree and threw figures into such attitudes postures and positions that hypochondriacism fleeted away like the dreary shadows of the December night and spleen withdrew to that Erebus in which she was engendered  Many things contributed to this unusual gaiety of heart At the corner of a little apartment I at this time occupied stood a small cabinet inlaid with ebony and slips of cedarIt descended to me in a right line from the male part of my ancestors and had been preserved entire with all that caution which we bestow upon a favourite  It became now not only a relick of family but a curiosity from its antiquity Both these adjoined to some other circumstances traditionally tendersuch as its having contained in one of the drawers those little golden circles which united three of my relations from whose fingers they were taken after death had dissolved the connectionlocks of hair also cut with a trembling hand by the disconsolate survivors as a last testimony of conjugal recollectionThese circumstances I say and ten thousand more which belong  to the heart  made this little pittance of patrimony so inexpressibly dear to me that whether  I resided in town or country and indeed whithersoever I went this was sure to be my travelling companion Its size was luckily favourable to such purposes but notwithstanding this avowed partiality it never would have been brought forward to the notice of the world had it not been necessary to introduce something  for the heart  In the centre drawer of this little cabinet was deposited in a case of velvet the portrait of a lady dear to me by every sensibility that attracts one heart to another I drew it from the case where  with all the jealousy of passion it was concealed equally from the breath of Heaven and the dust of the earth To tell you that the original was absent and then that I kissed the resemblance would be too cold too common and too unimpassioned a relation of the fact unless I acquainted you with all the tender ceremonies that preceded such a salutation and yet to make you acquainted with these is so far beyond the scope of any language in which I have any skill and I much fear so much beyond the scope of any language now in use amongst men that I shall not rob the best of sensations in the softest  of moments by any description whatever  Be assured the salutation was of that sort my eyes were darted upon the fair similitude with such a fervour and it was pressed to my bosom which throbbed at the junction with a feeling so far above the things of this world that nothing but the power who allowed the sensation could create words to express it  "And thou fair creature said I as well as that form which as much surpasseth thee as the masterpieces of God surpass the masterpieces of  man shall be the companions of my journey"  At this time the servant came to inform me my physician was at the door in the chariotI put the miniature into its case and descended with it into the parlour  THE HYPOCHONDRIAC  WHEN the doctor saw me enter with an air of chearfulness he again felt the pulse whose beatings he liked so well that he left me to pack up my things under a persuasion that the sooner I was gone and the more I engaged in these little sallies of activity in which hand head and heart are all at workthe better  But when a nervous mortal sets out in a hurry he runs himself downlike a watch injured in  those springs which sustain the wheels on their centrelong before the twelve hours and the transactions belonging to such a quantity of life are duly noted and performed  Lassitude of body produces fatigue of soul After all this vehement agitation forcibly carried on for more than sixty minutes in which I had more precipitately bestired myself than was either necessary to the occasion or consistent with the peace and quietness of any man's fibres unless they had been bound up with bracings of iron after all this I say heaviness came upon me and I  had sudden recourse to that benign Power who repairs this fragil tenement of nature which we carry about us a power whose obliviating draught every son of Adam and every being on the mortal scale whether an atom or a giant fondly thirsts for But even the slumbers of weariness are not sound and extreme lassitude is inconsistent with that serenity which produces after the decays and waste of the day a perfect repose  Be my body however in whatever state it might my mind asserted its immortality and assisted by imagination carried me in a  vision of the night from one room to another from the top of the house to the bottom of itfrom the drawer which contained my treasure in a small silken purse to that which held my apparel till I had fairly filled to the brim a responsible travelling trunk which being so well studded with nails and preserved by iron and leatherwork looked as if it belonged rather to  my Lord Anglois  than to an author  In the heyday of this visionary and violent exercise just upon the point as it were of ravishing the maidenhead of a  nouvelle  pursuit I represented the luggage as fastening  before me on the chaise into which I got with the dispatchful step of eager resolution  Methought the carriage was infinitely too largetoo commodious too roomyit appeared to my fancy like entering alone into a prodigious apartment without a single piece of valuable furniture It wanted something I rocked myself backwards and forwards upon the seat till the whole machine tossed upon its traces like a vessel in a tempest Never surely was there a more melancholy moment of seesawWhat can possibly  be the matter with this strange confound  The seesaw assisted by my more vehement movements encreased so much that every syllable jerked in its articulation  "What can possibly be the matter said I with this confounded rumbling miserablehung villain of a chaise It is like taking a journey on the rack" I bid the postillion go forwards a little Worse and worse The swing of the vehicle shook me to pieces What was before tedious was now unsupportable In hopes  that after I had passed the rugged stones of London all would go on smoothly I directed the driver to proceed  I reached a road more level than the green sward Still shocking and nothing in prospect but rock morass and desart Unable to find out the cause I grew angry as most people do  I could not tell why  and choosing to impute the whole matter to the carriage itself I insisted upon getting out and having it immediately changed so without more ado I opened the door myself and then shut or rather slapped it too as the only reasoning animal  does when he is in a passion after which pleasant testimony of the state of my temper and the amendment of my nerves I walked home with a speed which still farther signified that if a man had any little address to make to my heart he had better keep out of the way Just as fancy who had been playing these vagaries with a poor fellow who never offended herconducted me to the door of my apartment I was so thoroughly vexed with the seesaw of that same infamous machinewith the caitiff of an artizan who put it so pitifully together and with the proprietor at the livery stables who could have the heart  and conscience to send an hypochondriacal man the first stage of a long journey in a vehicle which must inevitably knock him up at once that I stamped my right foot against the floor till I fairly awoke and in waking loIt was a dream  It is fabled that dreams descend from Jove Presently it will be seen whether I have any reason for assenting to such an opinion But before this I have another stroke  for the heart  Weariness is not very delicate in the choice of her restingplace any  more than hunger is precise in the choice of her viands The one closes her eye upon the first shelter she can find as the other diets contentedly upon whatever presents itself I had thrown myself upon the departure of my physician upon a small sopha which not allowing me to extend myself in all the luxury of a bed at full length I was obliged to contract myself till my head hung uneasily over the edges of the sopha  Readers who are punctilious will insist on being informed how I came to know this when I tell them that I neither recollect the posture  in which I lay down and that I did not find myself in the position above described when I got up In all my writings it has been a maxim to request the reader will allow me the reasonable priviledge of telling a story introducing a circumstance and relating a fact my own way promising not ultimately to leave him in the dark although it might not be expedient to throw at first sight so much commentary on the text as he might imagine necessary This priviledge I still claim and indeed cannot find it in my heart to give it up but with the faculty which enables  me to fabricate the sentiments and set it down upon paper  I remain moreover more and more convinced that in adhering to this practice I equally consult my own ease as well as that of the reader Now had I told him for instance that some time after my waking from so perturbed a slumber I learned from the lips of that excellent creature from whose native graces were copied the fainter traits of the miniature in the velvet case that I was a little while ago found sleeping without a pillow or wherewithal to lay the head of an invalidHad I told the reader such  a tale without telling him at the same time or even previously that out of such disquieting attitudes I was removed by the tender care of that very lady who had laid my head upon her arm and was surveying me in a silent fondness which characterises the tenderness of a young mother when she superintends the slumbers of her sleeping son  The whole truth of the matter became from this moment apparent and I saw plainly into the nature of my dream which thus with the accuracy of a Joseph I proceeded to interpret  "Beshrew me said I if all the faults I imputed to the chaise were not to be imputed to  myself  to my own imprudence in entering it alone alone ahfoolish idea the chariot of the cloudseven that which Jupiter is wont to mount in his progress through the skies must have been uneasy unless the divine Juno was sitting beside himAlbeit that illustrious dame is said to have pealed in his celestial ears the domestic thunder of a wifestill it was societyit was still better than cutting through the other in solitary majesty"  And was I even though in vision about to traverse through unknown countries without societywithout  that  society which was most dear to me without one kind bosom to soothe me in the hours of accident or anxiety should either of them befal me on the way or one gentle soul to share my pleasures should pleasures be bestowed how forlorn is the path of the traveller in the gayest and most chearful climes How barren are prospects of the most ample expansion and most florid aspect if they are ranged over aloneEvery heart hath some delicate attractions on which it  relies in every situation of joy or sorrow for relief smiles and tears the sunshine and the showers of life must all be divided It may indeed sometimes be allowable to seek out a corner wherein to  weep  for there is a delicacy to be observed in the communication of  distress  but he who is a niggard of his  joy  and can be avaricious in his happier sensations is unfit for the more elegant connections and deserves to have his dreams invaded and his slumbers disturbed by disagreeable seesaws all the days of his pilgrimage through the difficult journey of life  This ejaculation supported as it was by the smiling countenance that was before me and by a touch of the hand that thrilled a feeling felicity to the very end of the fingers put the whole matter into a new train and made the second excursion of fancy when she was broad awake so inexpressibly pleasing that she once more tript with me into one of those carriages which she hath always ready harnessed at a moment's warningindeed it was the same I had before execrated and methought no chaise was ever hung on its springs so easily nor did I ever anticipate any thing with  so true a relish of expected pleasure as the moment of setting off upon a journey of near three hundred miles  ANATOMY OF THE HEART  THE reader hath now been brought as a witness that the person who sat for the picture was no longer absent and that she was certainly to be the companion of my migrations to whatever shores they were directed Fresh matter of surprise will it therefore be to him if he happens not to be quite so retrogade in his motions as the author of these pages against the likelihood of which indeed the odds are considerable He will wonder at that spirit of Quixotism  which enabled me to proceed in my plan without informing of it the only person who was not only most nearly interested in this event but in every turn twist and angle I should make in the journey of life  Peradventure the matter will appear even more mysterious yet should I with any face of seriousness assert which here I solemnly do that I took propensly the opportunity of this dear person's going out on a visit to pack up my travelling parcels and go on in the same snug obscure way even  to the last preparation of ordering a chaise to receive them  Curiosity whose eyes ears and mouth are always open would like to know the reason of this Now these pages being addressed to the heart I shall for the sole use of students therein enter into an elaborate dissertation in which I shall dissect that irregular part of humanity and by so doing settle the intricacy that seems to be involved round the enigma before us To such however as know any thing about nature or can any way account for the thousand whimsical traits which go to the making up a  single man's characterand of all others that of an Englishmanit will seem no enigma at all But my pen itches to begin the anatomy and I invite every stripling who is beginning to study the heart to be very attentive to the lecture which I am now going to read upon it  Minds there be to whom a scheme is delicious There is more of soul than body in it and very frequently the principal pleasure of it is carrying it on progressively to the conclusion with as much secrecy care and circumspection as would be necessary to carry on a  conspiracy It is amongst the chief of natural curiosities to take a view of a person engaged in a business of this kind Every faculty from the blood which flows to the heart which beats hath something to do and puts forth the best ability to the workThe idea once born with what parental vigilance a man cherishes the new creation How fondly he feeds it with the pap of imaginationHow assiduously he nurses it into strength and activity and how enchantingly does he adorn the fullblown folly with fragrance and with flowers that bloom for ever I wish with all my soul I could do perfect justice  to a delicate part of my subject which I am about to treatnamely  the doctrine of pleasing surprises  to manage which as they constitute the chief happiness of life demands a nicety and address to which few of either sex are equal  The most charming circumstances are generally the most unexpected Those which have been anticipated are despoiled of their virgin beauties and are sadly tarnished before they come into possession but in the true crisis to come upon the heart when perhaps it declines from the desireable medium and gravitates towards the extreme of sorrowin  such a season to steal imperceptibly upon the senses and gladden them with an unlookedfor enjoyment eclipses in lustre all the formal preliminaries and cold expectancies of a proposed pleasure that ever were made A long antidated pleasure dimly seen at a distance tedious in its advances and all its novelty gone before it comes within reach is the dullest of all things which are unworthily thrust into the list of delights it is like the certainty of the sun shining with uniform radiance through the year in which case his orb might rise and set without the least regard or homage The hearts for which I  am writing revolt from transports so villainously forestalled "Give me say theyI shall truly translate their beating give us the lustre which breaks upon us unawares Let  us  relish the blessing of that glorious luminary who is paramount lord of the aether when the storm the tempest the cloud impends horridly over our headsjust in the moment when we have given up a prospect of pleasure which depended on the elements When the rain and hail of disappointment descends upon us then let his beams produce his lucid wonders to dispel the collected gloom and shew us that  the homage of the human heart is ensured by surprise"  This point still admits of brighter illustrations  I no sooner discovered myself supported by the lady as above described than depending fully upon the success of surprise I began a congratulation on the near prospect of a trip to Paris "A trip dear lady said I elevating my tones in conformity to the charms of the intelligence for more than half whether of joyful or sad tidings depends upon the tones a trip dear lady for the tender feelings  an excursion purely calculated to draw forth all the finer affections an excursion moreover in which though we omit the description of hotels and streets and towns and towers with all the tiresome etcetera of the plodding travellerall that is novelle characteristic and curious all that is allied to the movements stops and meanders of the heart shall attract us on the way"  I need not have rambled into such a length of recommendation dear lady let us make a tour to Paris would have been enough Never was idea more complexed and fashion hath now associated with  the very name of that city such soothing opinions with respect to the urbanity smoothness politesse and courtesy of its people that a journey thither might have drawn a Penelope from her web and made her a downright gossip The most mild and moderate women in Christendom might be allowed some emotions upon so apt a piece of news coming too with such a direct stroke upon the nerves the more particularly as in the crisis of general vegetation when every part of nature acquires fresh sensibility one is more inclined to perigrinate  Let it not therefore be turned or twistest by any mortal who is hackneyed in crooked ways of misrepresentationah let it not be turned against the gentle sex if in the candour of my fidelity towards the readerwith whom I resolve to deal notwithstanding that I am on my travels according to the entire truth that is in melet it not I a third time charge the reader be turned against the fairest and best part of the creation should I observe that this notion of a trip to Paris was received with one of those jumps of ineffable approbation and acquiescence in which every limb  artery fibre and membrane leaps in concertin one sentence every atom that makes up the woman danced in tune to the harmony of the proposal  Readers unacquainted with  the heart  may nevertheless imagine there was an objection against this proposal on account of its  instantaniety  although so much pains hath already been taken to make it palpable as the light of Heaven that suddenness is the very sublime of a surprise To know the heart is as difficult a science as ever was studied Finespun subtle and delicate are the intellectual threads  which fasten and connect the corresponding thoughts one to another In a female subject these threads are so extremely fine that although every link is distinctly separated yet the whole chain which wreaths itself round the heart seems at first sight a chaos of confused matter unadjusted by any sort of oeconomy But to have any sound notion of this philosophical anatomy in which neither Galen Hippocrates or Machaon appear to have been adequate adepts it is necessary to know first that the sensibilities of the beautiful sex are not only more transparent and impressive than those of the male  part of the human species but lie as it were in a trainare engaged in the closest union and reciprocally maintain the most harmonious alliance  Secondly it is proper to understand that the affections of the sex are divided into two capital classes one class keeping jure divino full possession of the right side and one by virtue of the same authority of the left side of  The Heart thus  Affections of Pain  Affections of Pleasure  The least and gentlest touch upon either of the chords which regulate  these sets the whole fearful and wonderfullymade machine in motion There is besides at particular periods an exquisite andI had almost said divine irratibility in the sensations that torment transport or tranquillity a smile or a frown tears or laughter are produced in a moment It is but hitting off the critical situation to be master of the science that leads directly to a true knowledge of the heart  Thus for instance if a lover looks sombre a lapdog is sick or a ruffle is lacerated that nerve upon which as upon a main spring  is hinged the painful associations begins to distress the poor lady till a softer stroke on the nerve which directs the affections on the opposite side of the heart strikes up a tune of gayer emotions and makes all that was jarring again concordant Hence it appears as plain as the page which you are now reading that women require none of those tedious preparations which throw a damp over the face of enjoyment and which men of books and business too often demand before their sluggish abstract or Changealley hearts into feelings suitable to a pleasurable surprise And herein consists the indiscribeable  superiority of the female organization Every artery about them is hung more airily the avenues which nature hath opened to the heart though perhaps more involved in mazes are yet so like a wilderness of sweets that we have many more inducements to clear the way and examine them add to all this that certain voluptuous particles swim along the beautiful labyrinths that are formed by the veins and always fit them for a spirited proposal at a moment's notice  The per contra of this argument may even yet furnish corroborations still more indisputable Had a  Londonbred Lombardstreet citizen flush from the Change been accosted with a direct invitation to step into a postchaise to make an excursion to Paris those who have seen the workings of a merchant's heart will represent him as dropping his jaw uplifting his eyes and opening his mouth as if his whole sordid body of negociation was put to a silent stand"To Paris when he recovered that breath which surprise had alarmed he would exclaim ParisGod of my fatherswhat do you take me for Leave my own incomparable countrythe country in which I was begat in which I was born in which I grew in  which I prosperedLeave my gettings my gleanings my clubs my meetings my friendsLeave the Change the Jerusalem coffeehouse Lombardstreet and London Leave England the unparalleled Englandthe nonpareil of nations a land flowing with milk and honeyLeave all these joys and advantages for Paris a city of whip sillabubsthe capital of coxcombsa tawdry town made up of tinsel pomatum paint and petits maitresand would you persuade me to go from hence to such a countryno no noEngland England Old England for ever"  Oh Prejudice Prejudicewhat a monster art thouHow blind how lowthoughted uglier even than thy sister PartialityThou hast the vanity and ignorance to think that the handful of inhabitants scattered over the surface of thy own country are only in favour with the god of all countries and that all the other parts of the world are the wretched offals of nature unworthy the protection of providence Most irreligious suggestion most unbenevolent and unmanly Does nature bloom into luxuries Does spring burst into verdure and summer ripen into  blossoms for only one of the most diminutive proportions of the universe In what abject corner of thy heart didst thou find lurking this miserable system Be certain that the great Governor of Nature despises every illiberal tenet and thou canst not do better than to root it out of thy bosom for ever The bounties of Heaven and earth circumscribed by such an atom upon the scale as thou art forsooth The very mite that engenders in the pores of thy skin for whose banqueting thy personal beauties were partly made might laugh thee to scorn for such presumption Does not the sun with a lustre equally  lavish and luxuriant invigorate the vegetation Do not spirits equally cordial and cheary do not hopes and wishes equally ardent inspire and adorn other places and other people beside thee and thine Try a little I prithee to enlarge and to expand thy heart Venture for once to let thy fancy or thy reason or what else it is by which thou art distinguished as amongst the order of rationals to make an excursion beyond the confines of thy own kingdom Walk onward to the beach that presents to you the beginnings of that ocean which divides one part of the human race from common intercouse with another  and then casting thine eye the eye of the soulbeyond the waters be liberal in thy conclusions People of all manners all modes and all persuasions as well as of all languages pass in prospect before thee the Turksthe Jewthe Capodocianthe Neopolitanthe Genoese the Tartan the Swiss the Spaniardthe Frenchmanthe Laplanderthe Hottentot and the Arab Most of these differ from thee in ceremonies in habits in customs peculiar either to place or people but the great characters of the heart admit of small variations they all like thee have friends who are dear and foes who are  obnoxious their anxiety is expressed by tears and their felicity is marked by a smile Gentle tempers are every where complacent elegant social and pathetic and Fury is true to her characteristics and hath her eye of fire her tongue of venom and her arm of vengeance in all countries of the world Every heart too in every clime is susceptible of that softer sensation which not only draws body to body but soul to soul The tender sighs of passion the languor of disappointed love the agony of hope deferred seizes with equal force upon the Greenlander in his hut that is hemmed in by the ice and the panting  Indian who is buried in the foliage of his forest to avoid the burnings of the sun The ties of friendship too have a resistless magnetic power throughout the globe Charity philanthrophy goodwill also abound wherever men have assembled and wherever they have fixed only a temporary residence  No degradation to thy native land to say this Thy native land is distinguished by many excellencies Her soil is fruitful her sons are generous and her daughters are fairbut what of that Neither fertility nor generosity nor beauty are confined to her alone How  might the God of all government be accused How would the natives of other nations rise up with unanimous rebuke against him if he had limited his benignity in the manner thou would'st insinuate Nay how much reason would the tenderhearted even of thine own country have to complain were this the case The stubborn trader that hangs about thy heart is I should in charity hope by this time softened The man of the world and the ruggedness which is contracted by the pursuit of money is perhaps worn smooth by the force of social arguments and upon this persuasion I will venture to  ask thee whether even thou couldst avoid murmuring against such partial distributions Could'st thou withhold thy tears Nay couldst thou enjoy the smiles of prosperity were it possible for thee seriously to suppose that all that is good and fair and happy and amiable was resident only in Britain and consequently that all the other divisions of the globe were deserted by nature and abandoned by her director I make a solemn appeal to thy  heart  man of gain to know if thou  could'st  enjoy this  "For the joys of wealth I could" replies my hero of the Royal  Exchange "For Lombardstreet London and the roast beef of Old England so could I" echoes one of those chimneycorner characters who hath cultivated the clods from whence he grew and to which he shall return after fifty years insensibility just as wise as liberal and as serviceable as he was born  Fie fie and a thousand blushes upon such for the poorness of their heads and the pitylessness of feelings but I am writing  for the heart  and have therefore no leisure to address those who are without one  THE CONTRAST  FOIL opposed to jewel is the life and soul of brilliance The last pages should be set off by a contrast  "In that trunk said I Amelia I have without any ceremony put up your things with mine and with as little ceremony we will if you please set off directly for Dover in our way to Paris"  At this very moment the crack of the postboy's whip announced the arrival of the chaise  Had I talked to eternity with the eloquence of a Seraph nothing could have been so perfectly argumentative as the advances of this chaise at this periodIt did not leave a single word more to be said upon the subject As Heaven would have it too the evening sun shot his rays more merrily upon us and at the back of all this entered a person who by way of one of those surprises I have just celebrated paid me in the lawful money of  Great Britain sufficient of itself to weigh down all scruples had there been any feathers of objection remaining I could easily see that that side of the heart was touched which contains those vessels that feed the passions of pleasureI saw consent bloomingly written on every featureI took my little cabinet under my arm handed Amelia into the chaise and heard with pleasure the wheels rattle over the pavement  THE APOLOGY  ONE can scarce look attentively at any object in nature if we have but the policy to turn it in on all sides and place it in every point of view where it may be fairly seen without finding sufficient scope to engage the heart and its affections To such as are willing to exercise their better sensibilities there is not room in the whole universe for so much blank as might be crouded speaking figuratively upon the point of a needle Every part of the globe and all which it inherits  teems with subjects of meditation and I pity from my soul that poor creature who goes to sleep in his armchair of indolence upon the false pretence of filling up the hiatus which he would persuade us opens its jaws before him  Let no man therefore say I have been too tedious in my outset He who travels for the benefit of the human heart and designs to see how it beats what it is propense to and against what it recoils in the bosoms of a strange people must take care what he is about Besides which it is to be noted that although I was a little agitated so  that the nerves could scarce bear the concussion of the first idea of such a journey yet when one is cool enough to put circumstances into a regular train the necessity of "hastening slowly" is more obvious  I do not deny having made large strides towards the middle of the first volume of my travels before I have made any great progress towards the first place of my destination nay I farther own that the chaise is only now wheeling from the doorbut what of all this The preparations of the heart are manifold especially when it bids  adieu to its native country Those preparations however are all interesting and if related in a tolerable manner can leave no room for discontent Common journeys indeed whether to the farthest inn or to the nearest cakehouse undertaken upon the common principles of perigrination have few matters to settle besides the folding of silks emboxing of laces disposition of trinkets and other flattering fripperies which belong to the paraphernalia of trifling people All these are too superficial and skim about on the surface of the fluids without affecting the solids of a philosophical heart This last  sentence is by no means expressed to my wish but it may do to shew that I have not lingered unnecessarily On the contrary I hope the knowledge  of the heart  hath been manifest in every minute circumstance which hath interrupted me It is no small matter to fit out the heart of man for a long journey however it may at first leap at the notion of travel In one part of his house he sees one thing which presses hard upon his affectionsin another part he observes something else which whether dead or alive lays claim to his last attentionsthe cat purs for notice the dog fondles for his share of  courtesythe domestics which are left behind will at such a time venture to tug a little boldly at the feelings and the very household furniture seems to say unto us as it stands disordered about the rooms "God send thee a safe deliverance to the land of thy fathers" The tender impediments which happened to  me  I have honestly and frankly related I am now takingyou will allow me the retrospectI am now taking my farewell of the beautiful Thames from the elevation of one of the noblest bridges of the world which I am just mounting and if the reader is considerate enough to be satisfied that it was impossible  for me with any decency to get any farther I shall now invite him to let his heart travel with mine and Amelia's upon that road which leads to one of the boundaries of the British empire  SCHEME OF A NEW DICTIONARY FOR THE HEART  I HAVE already celebrated the beauty of the evening in which we set out Nature and art appeared indeed to be contending for the mastery and in the struggles of this very contention the elegancies of both became more apparent Who will not therefore forgive me if even yet I detain him with that animated apostrophe which broke from me at a time when I was leaving my native country  Farewell beautiful villagesscenes of luxuriant herbage pleasing prospects and magnificent mansionsFarewell too to thee imperial Londonto thy gorgeous edifices cloudcapped towers ample streets and multiplied amusements oh farewell  The spectator who hath not used his eyes to a keen purpose and who hath not indeed travelled far enough into the labyrinths of human nature or gone close to the confines of  the heart  can have no conception how much those clouds which either  beautify  or  deform  our day depend  upon accidents the most adventitious and circumstances the most minute One malapropos syllable is sufficient to turn smiles into tears and change the entire countenance of society Prithee reader grudge not the time thou wilt be taken up in looking into this subject  of the heart  Those partitions which seperate felicity from woe are so transparently thin and the powers the genii the passionsthe deitiesthe demons or whatever they really be which preside over the misery and the joy of life are so constantly at work that they alternately have their triumphs and their disgraces so often there seems to be in fact  no positive separation at all In the gayest moment of pleasure while we are yet plucking the rose which if it ever blooms at all blooms more charmingly in the May of our existence than at any later period how cautious should we be even in the act of cropping it least the thorns which are beneath it diminish not our ideas of its fragrance If I could either satisfy myself or those good people who may hereafter travel with me through these pages I would not fail to introduce in this place a chapter upon  words  Even as it is I must throw out a few hints just to put the reader's mind  into a track which may then be better pursued by himself  The  use of words  in the sense I mean to speak of them is not so much what philogicians and dictionarymakers interpret as what  Divines  express in relation to them  That which in the phrase of ecclesiastics is designed by  the government of the tongue  comes the nearest to what I would say upon the matter Let us suppose ourselves sitting at a banquet where festivity and hospitality have joined every hand and united every heart The tender caress the sentiments of  cordiality and the smiles of the face produced by those of the heart are before us What a feast were this for a man of any goodness or goodnature  He will not look upon such an occasion too near at least he will not  seem  to look too near to that source from whence flow the streams of pleasure and of▪ pain He will not in such a case  anatomise  The general aspect of benignity which brightens around him he will kindly imagine to be sincereand thatat least till the banquet is overanxiety of every sort is  with the dusky robe of drudgery hung up at home and forgotten  Let the man of mere goodness and good nature I say take all this for granted and let his soul sit down amongst them in perfect felicity Harkhark as the generous spirit of Bacchus begins to sparkle the wit and hilarity which he inspires becomes proportionably brilliant If haply the sable wing of sorrow hovered over any heart before all is now well again and the plumes of the dove cannot be more soft or more fair than the present moments but every moment beyond thesehowever white these  may bemay become a moment of agony and to prevent their really being such require the most delicate skill as well as the most consummate discretion in the  use of words  At this crisis just as the hilarity of the circle is mantling to the brim without overflowing let the sagebut without a sage's brow who travels for the information  of the heart  enter into the society as a willing and invited guest So long as the harmony lasts every key that winds up the feelings of sympathy must needs be in tune But alas how soon do the notes begin to jar the sound to flatten  and the strings to fly till the whole instrument becomes an instrument of discord Perhaps in less time than I am obliged to employ in the sentence that relates it one friend may wound another in the most intolerable part the peace of a fatherthe honour of a sonthe purity of a daughterthe continence of a wife may be destroyedThe credit of a merchant may be tainted and those hands which were before joined in friendly unanimity as if in the embrace they grew together may be stained with blood  Now all these misfortunes which very well might happen and a  thousand similar to them which  do  come to pass allor by much the greatest part proceed from not understanding the  use of words  Amongst all our dictionaries we have not yet one  for the heart  Ingenuity and excessive labour have employed themselves to instruct the illiterate world in the necessary points of verbal criticism and the arts have all been assisted by such means Human nature only hath been neglected and yet even Locke could not have engaged his abilities in a better cause  As words are to convey thoughts and as thoughts come from the heart  every pain or pleasure produced by words in fact originates from the heart Indeed how much and how often then gracious God are we in the power of each other What delicacy what oeconomy what conduct should we use in the  arrangement  of every sentence  Does the happiness of any man's heartdoes the character of any woman's famedo their pursuits successesdisgraces depend on  me  Have I all their hopes and fears as it were at will and can I dispense to the first joy or to the last anxiety only by the proper or the malicious turn of an expression  If this be the case should there not be one more dictionary still added to the listtediously long as it isin order to explain the language of the heart or rather to shew what terms it can and what terms it cannot bear To genius rather than to labour is this work recommended He who undertakes it must have mixed amongst men must have noted manners and must be at no loss to account for a thousand seeming contradictions that happen in society Thus equipped for the task he might enter upon the subject with all the address and nicety which it deserves Might it  not pursue some such plan as the following which I offer by way of hints Let us first touch upon the article  honour  and our explanations of this as well as of all other words must be exactly suited to the customs of the climate and the feelings of the heart For instance  H HONOUR  The heart takes this word in several senses though they all have a correspondence I With the hearts of young men it implies a quick sense of resentment with which is connected an high notion of dignity  independence c c It must always be used with great caution in the company of military people and in conversation about women nay the very tone with which it is articulated must be correctly and complacently in tune otherwise many fatal accidents may happen II The heart takes this word to imply amongst persons in business a sense of probity integrity fairdealing and common honesty so that it should in this case be always pronounced with a full copious unsuspicious and liberal utterance as the least reserve in the pronunciation may be attended with the destruction of the object whom  it describes The adoption of any expressions like those which are used by Hamlet such as we could an we would a significant wag of the finger an arch turn of the eye or a shake of the head as much as to say we know what we know any of these at the time of pronouncing the word honour is enough to make it necessary to take out a commission of bankruptcy  Let our second example of this new Dictionary be upon the article Society under the letter  SOCIETY  THE ideas which the heart associates with this word are complex sometimes considering it as extending largely to the whole species and sometimes to a few beloved individuals whom opportunity and the affections of the heart have selected from the rest It also signifies that convivial circle which bound by the most chearful cement is closely compacted for now and then an occasional hour merely to dissipate the cares of life and lay its ruggedness level by sporting  relaxations But in which ever import it is understood the greatest delicacy both in the choice and arrangement of words as well as in their application and the tones in which they are delivered is necessary As in the case of Honour so in the present of Society a syllable too much or too little a wink a nod a look the hundredth part of a false cadence or the most trifling variation from the keynote of philanthropy good will politeness or propriety are more than sufficient to ruin the system of the most agreeable society that ever was formed Nay farther still those who would desire to have precise  notions of the word Society should take care to enter fully into all the niceties proper to be used in articulating the word  SYSTEM  BY which the heart comprehends not only the different theories of Religion Politics Theology Mathematics and Philosophy but also different Systems of Taste Pain Pleasure Temper Humour Inclination Genius c c c Every man breathing hath his System and scarce two men in the universeand not by any means two women in itagree in their Systems exactly One man delights for instance in the slim genteel shape of his mistress and admires  her for a faint and voluptuous languor that he sees in her features another perhaps finds attraction in the same sort of form but then instead of a languid delicacy he chooses to have it animated by a vivacious and brisk power of the eye Lucius one day suddenly met Avarus who bore such an affection for Lucius that he found more pleasure in serving him whenever his situation called for accommodation even than in hoarding up his money in an iron cabinet that he venerated to the rust that was contracted over its surface It was therefore you see his System to oblige Lucius Lucius one day sent to his friend at half  an hour's warning for a supply of cash to the amount of an hundred and sixteen pounds which Avarus complied with in the following way to witOne hundred pounds by bank bill another bill of fifteen pounds payable at sight half a guinea in gold nine shillings in silver fourpence in copper and the residue in farthings  To scrutinize this mode of making up a sum through the formal spectacles of business it might certainly be censured as fantastical but besides that Lucius had no right to look with so accurate an  eye at a favour I shall enter a substantial caveat against all future objections by observing that it was consistent with the lender's System to pay it in this way and if it had contained two thousand times as many divisions subdivisions halveings and quarterings more till the whole sum was frittered into farthings still I say Lucius was the last man upon earth to cross his friend's humour He should have received the purse gratefullytell it over not with extreme caution unless he suspected the messenger never have the baseness but for the same reason to put a single guinea  into the scale and feasted his heart upon the firmness of a friendship so dear to him We are now coming to the crisis  It happened that in the fraction of the copper Avarus had made a mistake for by the account of Lucius there was an extra farthing and the interview which Avarus now had with Lucius was the first since the mistake was committed  Lucius meeting Avarus therefore said to him without any regard to the heart  "How much have you obliged me my very dear Avarus in that last supply it has answered all my exigences and made me entirely an easy man but apropos I must set you right in your calculation There is a small balance in your favour and I must insist upon giving it you"  Avarus who although a miser to all the rest of the world was to the last degree generous to Lucius because it belonged to his System so to be imagined there might have been some miscount of the black word that characterizes  the value of a British bank bill for which reason but even then not in the tone of eager apprehension he requested to be set right  Lucius for the want of a Dictionary of the Heart to set him right putting his hand into his breeches pocket but forgetting to put upon his face a smile at the same time which would at worst have compromised the matter with his friend's heart replied  "A farthing is coming to you"  He presented it to Avarus who started two steps back lifting up  both his hands and throwing them forward in the attitude of declining an offer  "A farthing coming to me said Avarus a farthing"  Nothing in the whole world not the most industrious efforts which malice could have used could have torn up a man's System so entirely by the roots Had Lucius made a sudden retreat into another country had he pretended that the draft upon the banker was five instead of fifteen pounds had he spurred liberality by a fresh application in short had he done or said  any thing but what he  did  say and do the Heart possibly might by some courteous interpretations have found a palliative if not a pardon but as it was assisted too by an half note of triumph as to the point of calculation some degree of ridicule and irony in the tones and an undue stress upon the first syllable of the word  far  thingconsidering I say all these heightenings the whole transaction was unpardonable  "A sarthing did you say coming to me exclaimed Avarus in rather a bolder note and with somewhat of a severer emphasis A FARTHING  Unhappy Lucius How could'st thou have been so ignorant of an old friend's System Better hadst thou buried the paltry the pitiful ballance in the bowels of the earth What inacquaintance with every finer operation of the heartnay what poverty in the circumstances that pass within thy own breast not to know that so wretched a punctilio so ungenerous an exactness at such a period must inflame every principle and every sentiment against thee A  farthing  Oh God of caution was there ever shewn from friend to friend so little policy or so large an insult"  The will of Avarus was in the amplest degree in favour of Lucius "A farthing coming to me repeated he as he went home after his interview with Lucius neither more nor less than a farthing" Upon his arrival he twitched up a pen and with a hand of hurry wrote as follows  TO LUCIUS  Sir  This is written to acquaint you that the sums of money you have from time to time had of me are discharged You will consider  this letter therefore first as a solemn deed of settlement which closes our connection and secondly as a receipt in full for the sums above alluded to That you may not be put upon my  account  to a FARTHING'S expence I send this by an especial messenger  I am Sir Your humble servant AVARUS  Some few years after this transaction the writer of this letter died His heart was so sorely hurt and his System so shaken that he  recollected Lucius amidst the afflictions of a tormenting distemper Yet he pitied his condition which after the quarrel became more wretched yet his sense of the injury struggled with the emotions of his pity He gratified however upon his deathbed both the passions that were contending in his heart Two distinct codicils for this purpose were added to his will and thus they ran  I For the satisfaction of those feelings about my heart which plead for the man who was once so near it I bequeath the sum of ten thousand pounds to Lucius  II For being too good a mathematician and not suffering an old friend to do a tolerable action his own way I bequeath to the said Lucius one farthing sterling of the lawful money of Great Britain bearing date on the impression in the reign of George the first to be paid to him the said Lucius precisely at three quarters and three clicks lacking of twelve o'clock at night by my gold repeater which I also bequeath him  THE RELAPSE  I CONFESS the preceding chapter is a very long one but I deny that it is a digression On the contrary it is perfectly in point and I desire your patience only for five minutes to prove this Allow me to step back a few pages  "Farewell beautiful villages scenes of luxuriant herbagepleasing prospects and magnificent mansionsFarewell too to thee imperial Londonto thy gorgeous edifices cloudcapped towers ample  streets and multiplied pleasures oh farewell"  In the course of these fervent compliments to my country I was unlucky enough to kindle as I went along till towards that part of them which addresses an adieu not only to the capital but the various  pleasures  in it I became perfectly enthusiastic  A glowing exclamation in the harmonious moment when every body within reach of it enjoys a benign tranquility is enchanting It may then be considered as an ardour of the soul aspiring beyond  the clouds but when it bursts forth as it did in the present case unseasonably nothing can be more irksome  As I articulated the tender word  farewell  there was more of the pathetic in the tones and more of regret in the motion of my lefthandwhich I waved in salutation as if addressing myself to the little hedgerow that was vegetating on the lefthand side of me than either prudence or the season in which the thing was done could fairly allow The epithets also as well as the images which they were calculated to embellish were exceedingly  malapropos To mend the matter they began with a degree of attracting moderation and went on in an ascending series of eulogy forming in the end a sort of complimental climax which when the summit was once gained no mortal soul could resist The transient reader who is in a hurry to get to the end of his stage that he may have the pride and pleasure of ordering fresh horses to carry him towards Paris misses all these strokes although they belong as truly to the heart and an hundred times better discover whereabout it beats than all the precipitation scamper or wear and tear of wheels  in the universe Now a deliberate traveller who whether he journeyeth in books or otherwise hath the patience to go as his driver or his author chooses he can accommodate himself with perfect ease to all the accidents and events of travel He knows very well that when heart and body set out together to make an excursion though it were but the tour of a week much more is to be done than if a man travelled in the ordinary way with the light luggage of a shallow head and animal carcase He knows likewise that when  two  hearts and  two  bodies incorporate and consolidate as was the present truth attention becomes  more complex and to expect a full gallop with such a weight were to believe it impossible for a couple of spiders to twist their threads into traces and so harnessed run off with the dome of that celebrated St Peter whose temple before my return I am resolved to see  No bad hint this methinks to the public who will by this time guess I shall not suffer any thing to escape meI mean so far as objects belong  to the heart  that I deem worthy their notice or protection  I must farther observe that the kind of deliberate traveller I have just spoken about will not only take into consideration all the  above  circumstances but many other equally cogent in order to account for the many stops and stays that attack him He is not ignorant that where the heart is much gratified the checkstring is pulled without any ceremony and the prospect is analized acre by acre and hedge by hedge let the postilion think what he pleases about it The heart is caught by innumerable small sweet incidents which pass wholly unobserved by the schoolboy who is  sent into a foreign country as a specimen of the worst and most unfinished crudities of our own The body of a British booby who is thrown into this world to tarnish a title though his mouth is usually as wide open as his eyes and who is all agape  for to see a fine town  is ten times blinder than the mole and crawls in a more abject manner on the ground at most he just earths the surface He traverses the fairest climes and is from top to toe  corporeal  not one ray of  heart  ever illumined him Like a being compounded of mere flesh and blood and on whom fortune hath lavished her favours in some measure to  compensate the desertion of nature he is drawn about the globe in a glittering equipage in which he either lolls with ridiculous supineness or sits upright with pert and perpendicular vacuity  Ask him upon his return to his native country with the worst of coxcombries collected from the trash of every different place through which he has past what he has seen  'He hath seen the world'  So seeth a fly seated upon one of the shelves of a library all the  science and learning it contains without comprehending a letter as to that insect the whole alphabet is a chaos which he can by no means call into sufficient order to spell his own name so to such a traveller the road from the spot on which I am now writing although it is blooming with all the odours of May to that which leads into countries infinitely fairer still is all an immeasurable sweep of heathground where the eye when disgusted with sterility is relieved by the verdure of nettlebeds and when weary of that must seek a last resource in the faminestruck  flowers which eject in ragged blossoms from the rocks  Not so the traveller of temper and deliberation His heart beats "tremblingly alive" to every thing which he meets upon the way Does the poor shoeless creature shrink as he presses his tender foot upon that earth which hath wounded him Happily a very moderate covering of some sort may lie at the top of the trunk and even if it lay at the bottom would not the heart direct the hand to take it out Would any reader be angry at this delay even though he should be so far benighted before  he got to the end of the first stage and to double down the leaf and sleep upon the road till the next morning If peradventure he should be apt to indulge fancy in vision with the last thing which occured in the dayand that last should chance to be such a thing as thiswhat an elysium dream would reward him  Is the traveller attacked by a poor wanderer who toils through the glow of noon upon the stony pavement of France with an infant clinging to her bosom and hath the traveller's heart nothing to say or to do upon such an occasion  Shall it be minute and extreme to mark what she hath done amiss Shall it be either lasciviously or insolently inquisitive who begat the child and whether it claimed protection by being born in wedlock or whether on the contrary virtue was to frown upon its birth and pass on for the love of chastity  Vile curiosity Is poverty and mischance the less pitiable then because they have not had either luck or the prudence to escape the snare which design is always setting against the simplicity of a woman Is she to be rejected because she  wants that sense of triumphant resistance which could alone support the fallen Bring me oh God of mercy these taunters into situations equally severe try them but a little by the magic wand of temptation throw in their way but one delightful trespass set for them thou power of trial but a single net only taking care that it be spread out by the hand of pleasure with threads of silk and knots of gold and then if these boasters glide not into it with the most easy captivity I will then believe thou can'st forgive the traveller who passes on without one moment's pause of pity and redress when the  charity of his heart is commanded by such a form to deliver what the condition of his life and fortunes permit him to bestow  The man who goes upon a Tour of the Heart hath also many oddities as well as many sensibilities to indulge He hath his  system  to thwart which is to destroy his happiness and cross him for the whole journey  There are upon a just calculation taking one man with another pretty nearly an equal number of singularities and virtues in the  best  and brightest characters and indeed  generally speaking the better and the brighter the more singular the singularity People who stay at home shew off these only to friends and as the world goes he who is not content to take a virtue and an oddity together when his heart is trafficking for an honest bargain deserves to be cheated  Travellers have a multitude of opportunities to gratify every trait with which their characters may happened to be tinctured In one intercourse with men he who imagines he shall be able either by his circumspection his cunning or his experience to purchase the pure  gold of virtue without some small drossy particles of peculiarity which eternally stick more or less to the figure of the character and indeed upon the impression which God himself hath made upon the man's heart is too great a fool to have any dealings with and I would not be condemned to trade with his heart for a single courtesy though he were a monarch  NoSuch crowned skulls I dare not so far violate truth as to talk about  heads  such regal caput mortuums having nothing to recommend them  within  are very properly decorated  without  and  when tricked off like the maukin of a milliner for mere spectacle are mighty pretty gaylooking things to which in their proper places at due and decent distance I have no sort of objection On the contrary mine eyes have very great respect unto them as objects of shine and shew nor ever did mortal I trust make a more loyal or essential difference or draw a deeper and broader line of distinction than myself betwixt such gentlefolks of greatness and glitter and those qualities which go in my less glaring idea of the things finite to the making up of amanwitha heart  As furthermore to the matter of that mixture of singularity and virtue it is too much  in grain  ever to rub out while we are on this imperfect side of the sun Nor is it at all necessary A virtuous man hath no vicious singularity nay very often the oddities and greatnesses which like the silk and worsted of different colours which are woven together into the web of tapestrywork are absolutely necessary to the beauties of the figure For my part I would not give a single sixpence for a character all of one colour I had rather see him so as he keeps out the  black    which neither in a moral or natural sense can be ranked as any colour at allI had rather see him I say of all the hues in which Iris is habited when she shews herself to us after a shower There is in every character as in every picture light and shade and lights and shades too of different degrees If there does not  seem  to be these depend on it there is some of the tints bad at the bottom they may be wiped out with a wet finger Let us be indebted to the goddess Iris a little longer Her bow is the aptest that could possibly be made use of I desire my reader to select from his friends the most perfect  man he knows and to place him in his imagination immediately under this most beautiful arching as it takes its sweeping semicircle across the Heavens  This being done look attentively first at the rainbow and then at the manthen compare both  Well you have placed him in all the positions of which he is susceptible you have allowed proper scope for the different attitudes of his heart and looked keenly at the colourings of his character  Now then tell the where is the difference betwixt the man and the rainbow Both are of all hues some are more amiable than others sometimes they blend and assist the brightness of each other now they disunite and now again they mix rays the blueish tints are touched more elegantly by still bluer the fervid red is softened by a fainter rose colour here a few streaks leave as it were the overcastingwork of a thin cloud they may now and then possibly assume an unwonted gloom they may be every thing but positively dark but it is all the works of a moment  the gloom passeth away and is no more The comparison is exact  Dispute then no longer against singularities The most suspicious man is the character which is without them but the truth is there never was any character either good or bad without many  Blessed be that benign providence who hath bestowed upon  me  a most plentiful variety of these singularities they are as the balm to lighten the lump of existence which but for these would sometimes be intolerably heavy I cherish them as I cherish the sensibilities upon  which they attend I take them with me in all my migrations and consider them not less necessary to me than my little patrimonial cabinet They have I acknowledge detained me upon the road to survey objects which others might have suffered to elude their examination Peradventure they shall detain me still and if they should I shall never lose sight of the amusement of the heart which after what has been said is surely a promise that will reconcile the reader to my  system of travelling  THE RELAPSE  ACCORDING to the order of common journals I should have compleated all that related to the title of one chapter before I proceeded to another but as my system of travelling is somewhat peculiar and as the reader very well knows subject to a few singularities he must not deem it strange if in obedience to the prevailing pulsation of the moment I should sometimes break off abruptly or pause on the middle of a hill or make a dead stop in a valley or turn short round  a cramp corner when the level road seemed to allure me right on The reader's heart would be poorly entertained by my sensibility if he was not a little supported in his progress by my singularity  A few chapters backward shewed me happy in the resolution of pursuing my journey The business of the last chapter set out very calmly to account for a  relapse  in this resoluion The wanderings of the heart took me considerably out of the road I made a digression or rather interwove liberally into my plan of pleasing the heart all the variety of the rainbow But  curiosity hath had her vagarie and if any of my fellow travellers think it demands an apology I here not only seriously ask it but turn the rein and promise to offend no more  The  relapse  which threw my resolutions so much off their centre and which threw my fair fellow traveller so much farther  still  off  hers  was as before observed brought about by that illtimed ejaculation of the heart made so much worse by animated emphasis  I sincerely invite the reader's pardon for being obliged to repeat  this ejaculation once more but I solemnly declare it is necessary  "Farewell beautiful villages scenes of luxuriant herbagepleasing prospectsmagnificent mansions Farewell too to thee imperial London to thy gorgeous edifices cloud capped towers ample streets and multiplied  pleasures  oh farewell"  The stress which I unfortunately laid upon the word  pleasures  brought in retrospect  those  pleasures which Amelia was about to leaveperhaps for everand the tears came into her eyes  The wrong side of the heart was smitten every vessel confessed the blow the veins were affected through all their labyrinths and at length the ideas which pressed hard for gratification burst forth into language  "Pleasures  my good God Pleasuresthe Pleasures of London of that superb city to whose shining countenance we have just bidden an adieu Wherefore talkest thou of villages sylvan scenes or ample prospects What are these but the mere avenues to those ten thousand more enchanting pleasures to which  they lead Why should I distract my memory or distress my heart by breaking in upon the charming catalogueWhy in so perfect a paradise should I enumerate any particular beauty Why speak of the heavenly round of Ranelagh The parading of the Parkthe magic novelties of the ingenious Cornely's the Pantheon Almack'sor the delicious indolence and cell of luxury peculiar to the PlayhouseWhy to these should I subjoin that radiant etcetera which like the glittering sparks in the train of a meteor all  depend  on these wherefore I say should these elegant certainties all be quited  for a country unknown and a people that are bound to my interest by no tie either of tenderness or nationsAh England England Old England for ever  Now although the hero of the Royal Exchange displayed more the heart of  business  than that of  pleasure  in his arguments against this Parisian expedition those arguments were not more characteristic of that wonderful whimsicalness which belongs to human nature than Amelia's the only indifference indeed was the merchant betrayed the variableness of man and the lady the variableness of  woman It is a most interesting speculation to look at nature in these her fantastical operations Perhaps those philosophers may imagine they have hit off this same Human Nature to a nicety who assure us that though the heart is an inconsistent thing providence hath given an adequate strength of reason at all times able to correct it This is  Reason  say they which like an expert ballancemaster can if she is seriously called upon sustain as a monarch all the subject passions on their proper equilibrium I shall not be so disloyal as to advance a syllable against the sway or sovereignty of Reason much less  shall I presume to dispute the truth of these carpenterlike philosophers who measure the lengths and breadths of the heart by the rule and square of professional formality for ought I know to the contrary they may be very good workmen and labour in their vocation with diligence and success Heaven forefend that I should gainsay so large and respectable a body It is only my humble wish in these Travels to observe that Human Nature is after all the exertions of Reason as constant to her objects as the wind of Heaven to any single point in the thirtytwo of the compass that the heart of man woman and  child like a bee in summer flies briskly through the garden of life hastily extracts what it is pleased to call honey from every flower of every colour without ever setling upon any and lastly that this very heart which is so wisely governed by the edicts of Reason is neither to be limited by land or water but without so much as asking a furlow of absence leaves Reason to enjoy her crown and sceptre in some obscure corner while it traverses the most splendid parts of the globe with a gayer companion and as if it was perfectly its own master doth  "Like the poet's eye in a fine phrenzy rolling  Glance quick from Heaven to earth from earth to Heaven"  This I readily allow is very rebellious and enough to make this same illtreated Majesty hang up the human heart and that human nature which so taints its allegiance as incorrigible traitors The truth is besides that Reason is somewhat too frigid and the heart which ought to be subject to her is too ardent besides this constitutional difference by which is destroyed that most cordial and excellent medium of excellent properties of which temperament the elements  are composed such as wellcontrived portions of air fire earth and water Reason by some means or another hath from the beginning of her reign which we are told was soon after the beginning of the world and I much fear will so continue to the end thereof been obnoxious to all the subjects of her realm The parliament of the  passions  are also flat against her and though these passions are the very powers when she was chiefly created and enthroned to discipline reform and regulate yet there is scarce one of them who does not so far from obeying oppose her edicts and laugh at her laws  nay so utterly is all the authority of this imperial dictatress renounced that each passion propensely abjures her council and though its rigid propriety is often confessed it will even suffer all the pains and penalties as well as the pleasures of disloyalty rather than submit  Love  contrary to the admonitions of  Reason  even though in the form and with the tenderness of a parent yields up the melting heart to irresistible affection  Nature  with all her address her force her enchantment first shews the virgin the Paradise she is delighted at the prospect one figure from all the  millions that swarm upon the earth appears all accomplished before her Nature threw them in each other's company Nature and even Reason suggests they are of different sexes Nature commanded their eyes to meet Every interview is more charming The gentle languor of the eye the fine suffusion of brighter blushes that pass over the countenance refusing long to tarry or to be long absent the delicate and stolen touch of the hand which sets the whole heart a trembling the halflook the whisper that sends forth the soul and all its wishes in one eloquent sigh the disagreements the reconciliations  the transports and terrors which all happen in him "ah these symptoms I say and many more too delicate for description too refined for language and only to be  felt  betray how far  Nature  hath carried on her intrigue Presently the moment arrives when the passion is grown to its utmost maturity and admits no longer delay Every artery labours for enjoyment Nature now colours the prospect brighter still Instead of a gentle languor she arms the eyes of the lovers with animated fire the sigh which before was conveyed in a whisper scarcely to be heard now bursts violently forth as if the heart  were breaking the blood which before coursed over the cheek in streams of serene ruby with untumultuous emotions now assumes a greater vehemence and rushes along in a tide of deeper crimson the stolen touch too which thrilled only a soft sensation to the source of feeling while the passion was yet growing now flings a feverish agony from its contact and is no longer to be endured  Poor victims of Nature what shall ye do or whether shall ye fly for relief in this exigence To enjoyment Ah no Reason with a frown upon her brow and a rod  of iron in her hand forbids it But Nature say you made us Nature misled us and Nature must answer for whatever guilt it is possible there should be in yielding to the tendernesses of love For our parts we are determined to be as happy as love can make us If we are right so much the better if wrong be it at the peril of Nature  Reason now assumes greater severity she threatens infamy disinheritance loss of honour and the hisses of society The children of Nature are obstinately deaf to all her remonstrances and while the sun is yet looking upon them in  full lustre from the Heavens they determine to give Reason the slip Love is ingenious and the following appointment is sealed with a kiss  On the left side of that field waving with the wheat luckily for our privacy not yet ripe for the sickle is a grove which that Nature whom they find such fault with hath just at this period imbellished with the most beautiful arborage you ever saw The trees my dear form themselves into so thick an alcove and the boughs meet salute and throw their arms about each other with so amorous a luxuriance that it seems the lovescene of vegetation  itself Besides this did you not observe when sometime ago we walked here arm in arm with Naturedon't blush fair creature she commanded us to walk arm in arma little to the right of a cluster of Maybushes we saw a bank of so peculiar a verdure and made so fragrant by the primrose and violet that Nature said we might rest upon it awhile as we were doing thisdon't you recollect the accident that happenedWas there not a lamb sporting with its mother just before us and did you not say in a whisper that next to those beautiful babes which are the  riches of happy parents lambs were the sweetestthe prettiest  To this grove then let us secretly repair Nature shall be our guide and as for Reason even if she should suspect us she is so slow a traveller that we shall have followed the advise of Nature before our enemies arrival let her advice be ever so difficult  Ah fatal assignation Reason is told of it The world is made acquainted with the tale All the menaces come to pass in agonizing succession and as to Nature barbarous nature the crimes of the  parent are visited upon her children to the seventh generation  But love is not the only passion whom Nature causes to revolt from the empire of Reason Revenge dies her hands in the blood of a brother and shews Reason either to be on a journey or in a sleep or else present and powerless The poor Maniac she gives voluntarily over to the whip the iron cage and the bed of straw Jealousy defies reason and stabs  her  whom he loves to the heart and often for no better reason than that "he suspects for that he suspects" Ah cruel Reason why would'st thou not set  Nature right in such a case How many lives might by so courteous an act be saved Hate also in despite of Reason seises her victim and the whole truth of the matter is that it were to be wished nature was less cunning Reason less weak and Passion less strong  This also accounts for the Doctrine of Relapses for none of the passions are consistent even with themselves The lover's heart though raging before often changes its object The revengeful man kills his friend and then kills himself to shew his remorse Jealousy throws his bleeding bosom upon that of  his injured wife and Madness sometimes recovers its senses till it has more to do with Reason than any of the rest  What inexplicable mystery is here I hope there is no man so great a foolI should say philosopher to set calmly down to account for this I wish with all my soul Reason was a little stronger  The  relapse  had like to have brought about a fresh  resolution  viz that of turning our horses heads again towards London  "At this rate said I if we pay strict attention to such a pack of rascally buts and ifs whys and wherefores we shall never be able to get on Amelia Let us be at least silent upon the subject and turn it over and over again in our minds without saying another word or communicating another idea till we get to Dover and then let us calmly discuss the whole matter over a dish of coffee at the inn where we will freely impart our sentiments to each other and either go quick back again or else proceed in our journey very much contented with having even in the course of less  than eighty miles seen  the heart  in to many different positions"  The proposition was pleasing and the bargain struck upon the spot It would have been humourous enough for a third person to see the trial which we had imposed on ourselves pushed at by mischievous Nature with all her adroitness of besieging in order to throw us from our guard We never had so much inclination to break a treaty or to talk in our whole lives A thousand little arguments which were not started before the inhibition took place now occurred The muscles of Garrick were never  more legible than ours at this juncture Every look might have been translated to the correctness of a syllable and as all other intercourse was forbidden we had ingenuity enough to sit parallel as well as the seat would allow and in this situation our faces entered into a very long and serious dialogue  The articles were preserved entire till we got to Canterbury where it was contrived by our luckless stars to dine upon one of those joints to which an English appetite beats the alarm of gratification To give it all the graces of my native  language never did a fine buttock of beef appear at so critical a period The Corn Wine and Oil of Old England were visible in the very grain of it I recollected that France had no idea of such oversized and underroasted enjoyments If I had made a contract with Heaven I doubt this would have been the time in which it must have gone hard with my fidelity As it was only a mortal promise it returned to the mortal dust of which it was formed  "And so this then said I this is the last fat of the land I am for some time to behold in Canaan"  All the horrors of famine and soupmaigre were in the thought and Amelia without thinking about the treaty contributed her share to its destruction"Eat then replied she eat heartily of that which the Lord hath commanded to be received today for if we journey on peradventure tomorrow we look in vain for the luxuries of Canterbury"  Amongst the number of things intolerable is a  relapse  When once the links are broken that tied a man's system happily and tightly together then all  "Within is anarchy and uproar"  After dinner as we were sitting in opposite chairs upon the very edge of ordering our rout to be changed He who hath the directing of all things in all places decreed that we should receive no benefit from banqueting so largely on the Corn Wine and Oil of  Old  England Providence in the shape of a deep sleep the consequence of these things came suddenly upon us and when we awoke the point was settled so perfectly that all our former objections were as vapours before the dawn and as shadows that glide away with the glooms of  the night A sickness like that of indigestion succeeded sleep and this brought on a train of physical reflections  "This vile practice cried we with some degree of asperity in the tones this vile practice which the English have got of feeding on such gross canibal food certainly brings about ten thousand distempers We live in a nation of Hottentots Would we were in France for  her  sons like our first parents in Paradise are  Airy light  From pure digestion bred  The rebuking watch furthermore for arguments love to come in a bodyinformed us that we had closed our eyes on more sunshine than would have been necessary to carry us to the next stage Convictions of this sort which although the honey of truth is in their lips the sting of remorse is in their tail never please us and when we are not pleased with ourselves Heaven take into its tender mercies and keep from the frown of our displeasure those about us especially such as might seem to lead us into the error We could have quarrelled with our teeth for eating  our eyes for closing and our watches for both as exactly as provokingly agreeing in the same story yea even to the tenth part of a click "A few of these farewell dinners said I giving my watch chain an angry shake would oblige us to take our leave of Old England with a vengeance"  "And of the great globe itself too" replied Amelia revenging herself upon a poor innocent fly which she briskly filliped from a flower on her apron where it had for the curiosity of its little heart just settled  The ball of retort being now up and the heart in a right humour to bandy it about stoutly to and fro we found it in the end a very salutary exercise for besides that it brought round our powers to their proper tone a  moral  reverberated from every stroke"If thou would'st avoid both illnature and illhumour eat not too heartily either of the boiled or the roast beef of  Old  England said one "If thou would be chearful and lively indulge not sleep after dinner in Old England" echoed a second "Beware of a dropsy" cried a third "The food of France is better because  cause it is not so good" exclaims a fourth  To conclude the whole never were two hearts more firmly persuaded that a ride in a chaise to the next stage would set all right again Astonishing as it may seem the heart neither of man nor woman experienced a single wandering from its point in travelling sixteen miles which is precisely the distance from Canterbury to Dover  Upon our arrival at Dover in high and happy spirits I asked my fellowtraveller wherefore in the  earlier part of the afternoon we had been so much out of temper  "Pshaw said she smiling you are hypochondriacal you know and for my partI ama woman Let us now make the best of our way I had rather go to Paris than to Paradise"  Whether Amelia closed her last sentence so ardently and in such terms for the sake of the alliteration or because it came from her heart I know not but there was a something in the wording of it which threw all former objections at a distance and so without attempting  tempting to answer it I walked about the parlour or the inn humming a tune of acquiescence and in the very next minute looking through the window observed that the pendants of the vessels which were ranged along the quay were pointed to the shore of Calais  THE PROSPECT  NEVER were the Heavens bluer the breezes milder the face of the earth more verdant nor did the sun ever go down to the westward in more serenity than upon my arrival at Dover I walked forth upon the quay to take a survey of that water which divides the shore of France from that of England Curiosity or perhaps some more contemplative principle induced me to borrow a glass from a gentleman who stood near me I levelled my eye to the  mirrour and either discerned or imagined that I discerned the spires of Calais  The intelligence was that moment conveyed with inconceivable rapidity from the eye to the heart which had a great deal to say upon the subject I directly interpreted its vibrations Thus it beatThe land of an old and very formidable enemy to thy native country is before thee The towers of those temples that are consecrated to a form of devotion and in which are practised ceremonies dissimilar to thine are in prospect That clustering mist which like a vapourish exhalation seems  to rise from the earth and settle on the shore is the smoke of houses inhabited by to thee an unknown people who speak a different language and are subject to different laws pursuits and manners The land from whence the eye is now taking its survey and that which it is surveying are both defended by garrisons fortified by men of arms who constantly keep a jealous and wary eye upon the motions of each other  Here the heart required a pause and I returned the glass to its owner that I might leisurely take a circuit round the quay alone  Five seconds of solitude at such a period when every thing about one conspires to nurse the multiplying images that are arising are worth a whole year of vacant society where there is not even room enough to think If there ever was a goddess of contemplation she must now have swum upon the still air with her serene wings expanded directly over my head  "To  sail  or  not  to  sail  was now the question"  I could not have desired a fairer opportunity to enter into all the  niceties  of this question which instead  of putting to the purse I put immediately to the heart  The grey sobriety of twilight came on apace the sun had left in the element only a few scattered flushings to welcome in the moon and even the moon was unusually softened into a lanquor that in the contrast made her more femininely fair so that the heart had every help with respect to scenery it could possibly wish  Upon a solitary angle that jutted from the quay apparently intended as a covering for the mariner upon his landing I sat me down There  was an arching of stone over my head in the style of a rude shellwork Every minute circumstance propitiated meditation more and more On the one hand the distant dashing of an oar harmonious by the regularity of its strokes played in perfect tune upon the ear on the other the waves which were saluted by the seabreeze sported with an air of friendliness as if to ratify the bonds of peace which were now enjoyed by the neighbouring nations  In such a situation the heart travels far in the climes of fancy  truth also is summoned occasionally but not very often  "Yonder vessel said I which is now riding calmly at its anchor whose sails shall presently be loosened to the gale and whose pennant is now streaming in passive obedience to the whimsies of the wind yonder vessel perhaps is destined to carry me from England to France  Francefrom England to France and wherefore did these ample beds of water divide one land from another but to divide also people from people man from man and  beast from beast What hath the elephant to do in the groves of the English linnet or what absurd principle would direct the British wren to the forest or cavern which is governed by the African lyon Why then I say this separation but to serve as a watermark in order to keep sacred that tract of territory which the author both of earth and ocean hath allotted to different nations Wherefore too this difference of religious opinion Whyalthough the Protestant and the Roman are kept asunder by only a slight arm of the sea why all this dissimilarity of devotional ceremony A thin transparent  partition of property this to occasion such a change even in points of faith But there is yet another article of this question to be examined Wherefore in the space of twentyone miles all this confusion of tongues Wherefore but to confine the wanderings of the heart and make every man contented with the society laws customs and religion of the country in which he was born  See we not also that storms and calms rocks quicksands and a thousand other perils daily happen to alarm those who have the hardiness to venture upon the bosom of  the capricious deep May not this arise in providential punishment of that curiosity and of that ridiculous ambition which can neither be bounded by the scope of a nation extending even in length several hundred miles nor terrified by the dangers of penetrating into the property of a foreign people"  I had worked myself up so exceedingly near to the top that I looked at the packet which now began to toss with the return of the tide till I heartily despised the very idea of tumbling about those different parts of the watery world where I had no actual business in  a wooden vehicle merely to have the pride of saying  Let no dog bark when I speak  For I am a  traveller  I cast my eyes after these reflections upon the waves and when I had listened a moment with ears which were  prepared  to be disgusted I imagined their sportive murmurs were augmented into roarings to reproach me  "Pshaw pshaw beshrew the folly of travel said Iearly convinced of the vanity and vexation of it I thank Heaven for the  impressions of patriotism and propriety that are written upon my heart and I will return quietly back to my own chimneycorner Yes yes there is sunshine enough in my native country to warm into blossoms and ripen into fruitage the few wholesome vegetables of which I shall at any time be master In any part of the empire I shall find a little cultivated corner not utterly barren of arborage A small shrubberry is easily twisted into a bower The pagle the violet and the primrose flourish under the humblest hedge haply too some plumy friends neither contemptible in feather nor song may both build  and warble round my cottage There too imagination may have as an associate the fairest of the fair Good God how she will add her enchantments to the scene It is now blooming full upon me I approve its proper distance from the din of London The cottage looks down from the slopings of a gentle hill Sweet is the salutary breeze that embalmed by the breath of the morning comes fresh from the Heavens I rise with the sun and feel his restoring ray animate my frame The honeysuckle and woodbines are precipitating their growth and promise peculiar fragrance as if anxious to  make the soil on which they grow agreeable to my heart And shall I quit a scene like this A scene which a very small expenditure might procure me Shall I quit it too for storm and rock a ship a long journey and the hurry of a huge city at the end of it  No no I am resolved upon a wiser conduct France quotha Not a foot farther will I advance towards thee and as to the portion of wastemoney that hath taken unto itself wheels and run away in order to bring us to this limit of England I calmly set it down to the account of that quantum of cash  which every man should keep in his purse to defray the absurdities of the year Indeed to pay somewhat smartly for having done a very foolish thing is not unreasonable Satisfied that the offence deserves the punishment I submit to it with the best grace imaginable I have only gone to the last limit of my native land I have not yet gone  beyond  it Happy is he who only treads upon the border of a bad action It is like walking on the extremest verge of a precipice The eye discovers the danger and we cautiously turn away the foot to prevent it"  Fully resolved to go back by the light of the morning I walked briskly to the inn to my Amelia anxious till I had made  her  as much in love with my prudence as myself  RESOLUTIONS BROKEN  SHE saw solicitude in my air on my entrance into the room of the inn and with a tenderness which was peculiar to her enquired into the cause On my coming into the room she was employed at the fire in warming a wrapping cloak in which she insisted upon it I was to enfold myself when I got into the ship A cap too which she had been airing would she said be absolutely necessary A small bottle of cordials to recover the agitated or exhausted spirits  after sickness her caution had likewise provided as it had also drops of hartshorn to remove those faintings to which I was subject  All these little preparations of her tenderness were like so many fair and favourable breezes spread forth to tempt me to the enterprize and waft over my heart To strengthen the whole in came the captain of the packetboat with all that hardyhood and jolly roughness in the tones of his voice as well as that tarlike twist in the tie of his silkhandkerchief which sufficiently mark those who are seasoned to that element which nature seems to have  prepared rather for fishes than men  It was written legibly in the chapter of the captain's countenance that the wind blew kindly from the Heavens and that with the advantage of the next tide we should certainly sail  Never was any thingnot absolutely utteredmore near to the tip of the tongue than a flat refusal to go along with him The picture of the heart must have been admirable What a pity it is Reynolds was not at my elbow to copy it I began with substantially  purseing my front into the deepest wrinkles of denial resolved to cut my way through all arguments and temptations When I had thrown as much ruggedness and severity as I thought proper into my features I turned round just upon the edge of declaring that I should not go  Amelia was at that very moment pouring some of the hartshorn drops upon the handkerchief which might refresh me in case of any sickness What a check was here to a man's intentions I felt the contracted muscles unbend and relax into the yielding softness of  compliance The heart was going as fast as it could to give up the point but after much suspicious stammer and hesitation it just allowed me fortitude enough to say to Amelia "I think my good girl we had better have the prudence  to  TO TO I say my dear traveller I do take upon me to say  that  THATTHAT"  The pauses which were made at these monosyllables could not have been avoided  Let the most rigid reader that ever was born tell me if they could  Immediately parallel to my eye hung a map of the continent of France and a little above that a chart of Paris with all its scenery gaieties and attracting magnificence The eye treacherously dwelt upon these prospects now surveying the city and now the luxuriances of a new and fruitful country It was scarce a moment's business  for the heart  which with the wings of imagination travels with the rapidity of light to pass through all the land that is governed by Louis I saw the grapes ripen under the sun that glows upon the vineyards of Burgundy As I traced the  course of different countries as they were marked by meandering lines upon the map I beheld the clusters of Champaigne burnish around me I felt also the atmosphere gradually brighten into benignity and all that can gladden the heart of an invalid as I penetrated into the softness of the south and after I had taken into my prospect all the beauties of the Seine and Loire omitting not whatever fancy imagined might contribute to the flowers and buildings which embellish their banks I looked for some relief from these insupportable temptations at the face of Amelia There however  instead of relief I was attacked by the artillery of arguments still more potent Her eyes sparkled as I ran my fore finger along the map as much as to signify if this is only the beautiful shadow how delicious must be the substance I wish it was the moment of departure with all my heart  A fig for the world's opinion of my weakness There are times and seasons when weakness is graceful I believe about this period my face was as smooth as the lucid stream in which Eve surveyed herself but had a few stoic wrinkles still preserved their inflexibility  they would have been presently erazed by one of those smiles which from the beginning of the world to this very hour have decided the most difficult points in an instant And as if all this was not enough she added the reinforcement of that eloquence which when it flows from a thin and rubied lip talks down every trace of the most abstract philosophy  "What pleasure shall I enjoy said my fair fellow traveller gently and as a friend pressing my right hand which was next to her what pleasure shall I indeed enjoy if in our tour to this paradisaical  land of promise health should deign to be the companion of our journey The same beams which are darted upon the grape and make it so much richer and brighter than the scanty vintage which clings reluctant to the walls of Britain may animate also the declining man Added to this how agreeable will it be to look at the customs and general air of a country so conspicuous and which makes so brilliant a figure in the map of the world as France but what is yet moreto have visited the metropolis of that gay country To have been at Paris at Paris my dear Sir which is the seat of  entertainment the circuit of delight the centre of softness elegance pleasure politesse and the Heaven of women Oh that the packet was this moment under sail I can scarce bear the delay Sure this is the longest night in the year Ah my friend try to take from the hours some part of the anguish which I feel from their delay Fill up the horrid interval with something that may draw upon the treasury of our future amusements Let every deity who delights in water be invoked to favour our passage Supplicate Neptune Thetis with all the Tritons  Amphitritons Naiads Neriads and Seanymphs in their train Promise even now while the prayer may be best formed in the enthusiasm of the heart to erect temples of unparelled shellwork to the dewylocked Sabrina Promise to rebuild her chariot of entire pearl on our safe arrival Pray with still greater fervor that the demon Hypochondriasis may be the only thing which is thrown overboard in our passage and that none of the powers may want the homage or the deference which is due to them petition the gentle Zephyrus and all his breezy companions to  spread out our canvass and indulgently direct us to the port of Calais"  So much am I the child of nature and the heart that so far from checking this torrent of a rhapsody like a man who had made up his mind upon the subject that I was almost as much affected as the speaker of it Towards the middle of the invocation to the seagods I gave three jumps with the agility of a Frenchman and I think my nerves were all the better for the concussion  When she pointed to the environs of Paris as if to the text of her voluptuous commentary upon the charms of that city especially as her wrist was not without a bracelet and that bracelet not without a flattering figure by no means in the attitude of refusal the animal spirits coursed along the veins with such celerity that I felt them throb at the very ends of my fingers and at the conclusion every thing within me played a tune so brisk and vivacious that had every wave been a rock I do verily think so wrought upon  as I was I could not have thrown the cold water of refusal upon the beautiful warm blood which glowed on the face of these animated hopes of the heart  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
