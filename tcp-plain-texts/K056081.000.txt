 AN ESSAY ON THE JUSTICE OF GOD  Verily there is a reward for the righteous verily he is a God who judgeth in the earth  PSALMS  LONDON  Printed for J JOHNSON at No in  St Paul's ChurchYard    Price SIXPENCE  An ESSAY c  MEN in delineating the divine attributes have too generally blended with them all their own imperfections Their several separate interests and contradictory passions have led them even under the character of  the One God  to represent to us almost as many different gods as impeached the wisdom disgraced the worship and sullied all the glory of the antient Greeks and Romans Nay the same persons in their very  Harmonies  have represented one attribute as a flat contradiction to another Blind and presumptuous creatures It is well for yourselves that your jarring systems cannot at all affect the real character of the Supreme Being To the joy of the whole universe whatever you have said and whatever you may still say  God is the same yesterday today and for ever  But should it be still asked To what causes are we to ascribe the monstrous misrepresentations of the Deity which daily occur After what has been said above I need only reply Is not the cause quite obvious Or if desired to explain myself more particularly I would observe That men  instead of seriously consulting the works and will of God and hence inferring what his perfections are have on the contrary regarded only their own tempers and inclinations and to vindicate all the follies and impieties arising from these have endeavoured to persuade the world that the peerless Jehovah is  altogether such a one as themselves  As men have been interchangeably actuated with different malignant passions they have proportionably represented to themselves a God who would be pleased with such worshippers And thus have they at different times endeavoured to divest him of his most honourable perfections they have repeatedly indeed been so glaringly inconsistent with themselves as to adore him in the same breath as  the Father of all mercies  and as  a Being without any mercy at all  that is a  reprobating God  But of all the perfections of the ever blessed God his justice has perhaps in general been the least understood However under no other characteristic whatever has he been so shockingly misrepresented and blasphemed The justice of God indeed has been frequently described in such a light as supposed him dispossessed of every endearing excellency as declared him not the Friend and Father but the merciless Tyrant of the universe and as led us to think upon his holy name not with hope confidence and joy but with all the trembling horrors of despair Men in vindicating what they called the Justice of God have too often lost fight of his goodness nay have entertained and propagated such ideas of justice as absolutely militated against the possibility of goodness and as forbad us to consider him as at all merciful gracious compassionate forbearing and longsuffering This has been always the case  when justice has been represented as an essential obligation or unchangeable disposition in the Supreme Being to punish every the least offence iniquity transgression or sin in every rational creature or when by saying that  God was just  it was meant that  there was no forgiveness with him without an equivalent satisfaction  But the bare mention of such an idea of justice must I should think convince every rational being that it is false It must be plainly seen that justice in this light or rather in this darkness is only another term for rigour for inflexible rigour and implacable severity a character that we detest even in man and which we cannot therefore apply to the infinitely adorable God without being guilty of the most outrageous impiety It must I say plainly be seen that if justice signified rigour God could not be just and good at the same time for the one is as contrary to the other as light is to darkness This will be evident from the universally allowed acceptation of the terms  In the first place then goodness implies it is well known that benefits are bestowed without the prospect of any return But rigour implies as the proverb goes that  nothing is done for nothing  Again the goodness of God implies that he is not strict to mark our iniquities But rigour if this could be supposed to be one of his attributes must make him punish with exact weight and measure every failing not excepting the smallest of which any being is guilty Hence then it is obvious that those who understand by the justice of God his unchangeable disposition not to pardon the least violation of his laws without an equivalent satisfaction inasmuch as they thus declare that  there is no forgiveness with him expressly declare at the same time that he is neither merciful nor good Nor do they at all alter the case by supposing that he will accept that debt from another which the delinquent himself is not able to pay for this is still supposing that there is no forgiveness with him or that there is no goodness with him for a good being must have forgiveness in himself Accordingly we never ascribe forgiveness or goodness to the man who insists upon the whole of his debt and who will never be satisfied until the whole is paid though he should consent at the same time to accept this debt from another besides the person who owes it for by accepting it even from another he has all he could demand and all he could form any pretensions to have a right to receive Nor do we ever ascribe any merit or praise to such a man these are due only to him who paid the debt not at all to him who received it to the full though from the hand of a third person Surely then we cannot compare the ever blessed God to such a man we cannot divest him of goodness we cannot represent him in a light that would fix a reproach upon any of his imperfect creatures We cannot suppose that there is any goodness or mercy in the universe if not with him the fountain of the whole We cannot suppose that any of his creatures are more benevolently disposed than the great Creator We must suppose that if there be any love any tenderness or compassion in any being whatever these must reside in their infinite fullness in the Almighty and everlasting God Rigour therefore cannot be one of his attributes His justice must be such as renders him the object of our most delightful contemplations  and as is consistent therefore with all his other most glorious perfections This I shall now endeavour to shew is not only the doctrine of reason but is likewise deducible from the whole volume of scripture  To this purpose then a fine field for satisfying all our enquiries is opened to us in the eighteenth chapter of the book of Genesis which from the twentieth to the end of the thirtysecond verse expressly treats of the justice of God  The LORD said  to Abraham  because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grievous I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not I will know  Mere cavillers only can object to the familiarity of the language used in this passage    And Abraham drew near and said Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city wilt Thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are  therein  That be far from Thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee SHALL NOT THE JUDGE OF ALL THE EARTH DO RIGHT And the Lord said If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city then I will spare all the place for their sakes And Abraham answered and said Behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD who am but dust and ashes Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy all the city for  lack of  five And he said If I find there forty and five I will not destroy  it  And he spake unto him yet again and said Peradventure there shall be forty found there And he said I will not do it for forty's  sake And he said unto him O let not the LORD be angry and I will speak Peradventure there shall thirty be found there And he said I will not do it if I find thirty there And he said Behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD Peradventure there shall be twenty found there And he said I will not destroy it for twenty's sake And he said Oh let not the LORD be angry and I will speak yet but this once Peradventure ten shall be found there And he said I will not destroy it for ten's sake  Now there is not a single circumstance in this history which can lead us to conclude that the Justice of God is repugnant to his merey but only that it essentially belongs to him as a just being to make a distinction between the righteous and the wicked and not to destroy the innocent with the guilty Abraham intreated God not to punish but to spare to spare even the guilty if it should seem good to his infinite wisdom or if they were found to be past hopes to be incorrigibly hardened and impenitent to vindicate his justice by sending redemption to the righteous Nor did the LORD threaten to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah because the inhabitants were imperfect creatures or because they had fallen into involuntary errors or because that though they might be then penitent they had formerly been wicked but because that they were totally depraved because they had irreclaimably given themselves up to the foulest vices that could be perpetrated or invented and that no means of salvation that were offered them could work a reformation in them  And the Lord said because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is  great  and because their sin is  very grievous  I will see whether they have done according  to the cry of it that is come unto me  From which it may be concluded that if their sins had not been of the deepest dye and such as admitted of no sort of extenuation and had they not resolved to continue in them too against all possible means of conviction God would still have been gracious to them and granted them a space for repentance We learn accordingly that after the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah had been greatly corrupted sentence was not suddenly executed against them but that Lot on the contrary was sent to sojourn among them to reprove them for their impieties and to admonish and persuade them if possible to repent and live and it was not until they had rejected these means of grace abused the divine forbearance and longsuffering waxed still worse and worse and wholly given themselves up to work all iniquity with greediness that the impending judgments of God were let loose upon them In his whole conduct towards this people his justice did not at all interfere with his mercy his justice did not hinder the calls of grace and reconciliation for a longtime to take place his mercy was extended towards them until the farther extension of it could be of no use to them indeed until mercy and goodness to other nations rendered their destruction necessary Abraham therefore did not address God saying that his justice required immediate vengeance upon all his adversaries or that his justice was irreconcileable with his pardoning or forbearing to punish any criminal  This however must have been his language had he entertained the common shocking ideas of the divine justice or any ideas of this divine attribute at all similar to these  but that his justice could not suffer any evil to befal  the righteous  Abraham drew near and said Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein That be far from thee to do after this manner and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee Shall not the judge of all the earth do right  Here the line of justice is exactly drawn And it has not we see the least respect to any kind of implacability in the Divine Mind nor does it suppose that God cannot  freely  pardon the truly penitent in perfect consistency with the full exercise of his justice but is wholly confined to this rule that God will make a proper distinction between the righteous and the wicked and that he will punish none more than their iniquities deserve In other words the Justice of God signifies that he is a being of absolute and unchangeable rectitude and that there is not the most distant shadow of any kind of injustice with him or as Moses describes him cloathed with this attribute that  he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are judgment a God of truth and without iniquity just and right is he  But here it should be particularly observed when we say that the Justice of God signifies that there is no  injustice  with him that forgiveness of sin is not to be included in our idea of injustice for if it was what should become of the whole universe of dependant beings God chargeth his very angels with folly and as to the rational beings in this world  what man is he that liveth and sinneth not  If God was therefore strict to mark our iniquities or if his justice and pardoning mercy were at variance misery must inevitably be the portion  of the whole human race But it is our comfort that God is not strict to mark our iniquities that he delighteth not in the death of a sinner that he is gracious forbearing and longsuffering towards us and not willing that any should perish It is our comfort that his justice is in no respect repugnant to his goodness that his justice freely admitteth of the infinite riches of his grace that his justice does not at all imply that he is  an inflexibly rigorous judge  but only that  he will make a proper distinction between the righteous and the wicked that he will not punish the wicked more than their iniquities deserve that he will not disappoint the hopes nor frustrate the expectations that he has raised in his creatures and that he is no respecter of persons  In the first place  The Justice of God implies that he will make a proper distinction between the righteous and the wicked  That the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from God Shall not the judge of all the earth do right It would be obviously wrong to slay the righteous with the wicked or to put the wicked on a level with the righteous and it would be more wrong still it would be truly diabolical to prefer any of the wicked to any of the righteous and merely to display his power to introduce any of the wicked to a place of happiness and to consign any of the righteous to a place of misery God therefore as a just being cannot admit the wicked to the joys of the righteous a distinction must take place and a distinction among the righteous themselves according as they severally have been more or less obedient to his voice But then it can be no injustice to the righteous to grant the wicked a space for repentance nay to bear long  with them to see if they will turn from their evil ways and to give them peace and reconciliation when influenced by that wisdom which descended from above and following the innate dictates of their own minds they truly  seek the Lord and find him  If this was injustice the righteous themselves could have no hope for they have not been always found perfect before God they could therefore only look in this case for a less degree of punishment than would be inflicted on the wicked But all the ends of justice must it is obvious be completely answered by rewarding the righteous according to their sincere though imperfect obedience and by punishing the wicked only when their punishment becomes necessary when they become reprobate to every good work when therefore farther forbearance towards them not being sufficient to reform them could be of no use to themselves and might be cruelty to the rest of the creation  Secondly  The Justice of God implies that he will not punish the wicked more than their iniquities deserve  This is obvious at first view for strict justice can never exceed in its sentence the proportion of guilt in any offender God therefore as a just being cannot punish us for what we could not do nor for what we could not avoid doing nor for any iniquities of others to which we were no way accessary nor consenting On the contrary as the most just of all beings he may be longsuffering towards us and delay his judgments until the ruin of the innocent would be the consequence of any farther delay and as the most holy of all beings he may likewise graciously accept the returning penitent How infinitely injurious is it to his justice therefore even to insinuate that he will inflict endless  torments upon a very great majority of his creatures for a crime that was committed before they existed six thousand years before  many  of them existed and that  there are millions of infants in hell not a span long  I cannot so much as mention this doctrine of devils without the utmost horror Nor should I mention it at all it reflects such dishonour and reproach upon the children of men to suppose that any individual of them is capable of believing it was it not known that there are still some who zealously maintain and propagate it Let such enjoy their sentiments if they can But while reason and revelation have any influence upon the human mind their God will be considered as a fictitious being the work of a bewildered imagination and as such will be discarded out of the world  But thirdly  The Justice of God requires that he will not disappoint the hopes nor frustrate the expectations which he has raised in his creatures  Justice even among mankind requires that we should perform all our obligations to the full that if we have made any promises we should keep them that if we have cherished any particular confidence in us if we have even encouraged offenders to hope for our favour we should not cruelly deceive them Therefore the Justice of God requires that he will fulfil all those expectations which we are emboldened to form of his goodness Though Justice could not oblige him to promise immortality to those who never deserved it yet justice ensures immortality to the righteous after it is promised and justice ensures pardon to the truly penitent after they are once encouraged to hope for it at the throne of grace Justice therefore must satify those desires of living beyond the  grave which for ever animate us must crown us with unfading glory and honour if we live up to the terms of the blessed gospel must give us at all times free access to the throne of mercy and crown all our  sincere  though  imperfect  endeavours to humble ourselves before God and to serve him in spirit and in truth with all those rewards that are represented to us in the sacred treasury of his word The apostle therefore says  God is not  unrighteous  to forget your labour of love  signifying that after God has encouraged us by a patient continuance in well doing to seek for glory honour and immortality he cannot consistently with his justice disappoint the hopes of his faithful servants  But lastly  The Justice of God requires that he should be no respecter of persons  Justice in the distribution of gifts or rewards can only consider the worthiness or unworthiness of any particular person cannot respect any one man in preference to any other man of exactly the same pretensions to favour In the court of justice the rich and the poor the bond and the free the prince and the peasant must be upon the same common level In the court of justice there can be no taking of bribes nor distinction of country fect or party And here the good that we would have done but could not must set us in the same light with those who had the opportunity and ability as well as the will to do the same good God therefore as a just being▪ can have no favourites among his children independently of their devotedness to his service He cannot respect their persons nor be biassed by pompous appearances but as he has made of one blood all nations of men to dwell upon the face of the whole earth  whether you be Jew or Greek ruler or subject master or servant born in the first or in the last ages of the world it makes no difference in his eye The only difference that he can make must arise from the different circumstances in which mankind have been placed But this difference he must make as no respecter of persons He cannot require brick where there was no straw He can only require a benevolent heart where there is neither silver nor gold and he cannot judge those by the law who had not the law nor those by the gospel who had not the gospel Where he has given ten talents though there he must be expected to look for the improvement of ten yet where he has given only five talents he can only look for the improvement of five and where he has given only two talents he can only look for the improvement of two In short the equally sincere and upright in his service all the advantages or disadvantages of their situation being considered must be equally acceptable with him and equally rewarded by him  Having thus endeavoured to give the reader right apprehensions of the divine justice and such as represent the great God to us not in a forbidding but in an amiable and endearing light I shall now proceed to shew that the justice of God is and must be such as I have here described it  This I shall first endeavour to shew upon the principles of reason from his other perfections and secondly from the scriptural account of his dealings with the children of men  There can then it is obvious in the first place be no temptation to injustice but from dependency or want or from motives of benefitting ourselves at the expence of others God therefore  being supremely exalted above all principalities and powers the fountain of all being the Lord of the whole creation and possessing in himself an infinite and independant fullness of all possible bliss and it being impossible that he can derive any benefit from the oppression or total extinction of any or of all his creatures God therefore I say cannot possibly do an unjust thing As all men in common are equally his own offspring so far he can make no distinction between them but every one man must be as much the object of his care and bounty as every other man And as he could have no possible motive to create any being but to make that being happy he therefore cannot possibly take pleasure in the misery of any creature nor suffer any creature to labour under oppression without sufficient reason unless it be its own fault or he should know perplexed and cloudy circumstances to be necessarily conducive to improve it in knowledge virtue and happiness Farther as the infinite mind must delight in those perfections in others which he exerciseth himself must love his own image in his creatures must approve of the grateful and upright heart must consequently disapprove of the profane and disobedient wretch he must therefore make a proper distinction between the righteous and the wicked must crown the righteous with greater or with lesser dignity and glory according to their several attainments in holiness and perfection and must debar the wicked of the joys of the righteous But that the justice of God at the same time is in no case repugnant to his mercy is demonstrable from our own existence from the numberless unceasing blessings which we daily receive and from the animating hopes we are taught to entertain of more enlarged  communications of the divine favour in a future scene We know that we have all sinned against him and that if he should strictly deal with us  after our transgressions  or determine not to pardon any of our trespasses against him we must long ago have been consumed We know therefore that his justice and mercy are not at variance that his justice is consistent with his patience forbearance and longsuffering that his justice can be slow to punish and ready to pardon and that it can spare the guilty themselves until they have repeatedly rebelled against the divine laws thrown off the divine government entirely and rejected all those means of conviction and salvation that could be reasonably extended towards them or be reasonably expected from infinite benevolence Once more as the only end of deferring punishment can be the reformation of the offender and as we have a relish for and are taught to look forward to a future and everlasting state of happiness upon our sincere though imperfect endeavours to serve God God therefore because so great so glorious and independant a sovereign could have no possible motives to mock the creatures of his power but certainly intendeth us for such a state and certainly will introduce us to such a state if we make the best preparations in our power for it Those hopes of the righteous  these longings after immortality  which his infinite goodness without any claim or merit on our part originally infused into the soul his infinite justice must fully satisfy He cannot as the universal Father and the allsufficient God disappoint any of those expectations which he has raised in his rational creatures His justice I say must complete those views and if we live up to the dictates of his wisdom satisfy  those boundless desires with which his adorable and infinite goodness has inspired us  These are the sentiments of reason upon this subject and in perfect harmony with these are the history of God's dealings with the children of men from the beginning of the world and the plain declaration of his revealed will which are recorded for our instruction in the holy scriptures The first man Adam experienced no kind of repugnancy between the divine justice and the divine mercy It was said even to Cain after he  was very wroth and his countenance fellIf thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted  Nay the justice which afterwards punished him for his great wickedness admitted of the extension of mercy upon his repentance and his punishment seems to have been purposely calculated to lead him to repentance The doctrine which I have been endeavouring to establish is still farther confirmed from the history of David Manasseh and many other remarkable delinquents But as it would be an endless work so it does not seem necessary to examine the divine dispensations towards each individual whose virtues or vices or whose virtues and vices together are held up to our observation in the scriptures The history of the antediluvian world the whole history of the Jews from the beginning to end the history of Nineveh and Babylon and Tyre and Sidon and the deplorable state of the world when the man Christ Jesus revealed all the riches of God's grace to his most abandoned offspring are all to my purpose To my purpose likewise are the innate sentiments of the human mind as these are successively represented to us in the scriptures  Doth God pervert judgment says Bildad or doth the Almighty pervert justice  Meaning that God could not do an unjust thing  Is it good unto thee  says Job  that thou should'st oppress that thou should despise the work of thine hands and shine upon the council of the wicked He is excellentin plenty of justice  says Elihu  he will not afflict  but according to wisdom and equity  and he shall judge the world in righteousness  says the Psalmist not meaning with rigour but without injustice  he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee for thou LORD hast not forsaken them that seek thee  Again the Psalmist says  Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne mercy and truth shall go before thy face  In like manner God is represented by the prophet Jeremiah as proclaiming his own character  I am the LORD who exercise loving kindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these things I delight saith the LORD  Here  lovingkindness  can evidently bear no opposition to  righteousness  or  justice  though God will make a distinction between the righteous and the wicked and inflict tremendous punishments upon the incorrigibly wicked according to the preceding and following verses This is also the sentiment of Eliphaz when he says  Shall mortal man be more just than his Maker  Farther the ideas which I endeavoured to convey of the  impartial  justice of God are likewise uniformly handed down to us by the sacred penmen  He accepteth not the persons of princes nor re gardeth the rich more than the poor  Job  xxxiv  Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me O  children of Israel saith the LORD  Of a truth I perceive says Peter that God is no respecter of persons  Paul repeatedly says the same thing and asks the Romans  Is he the God of the Jews only Is he not also the God of the Gentiles Yea of the Gentiles also  Again that the Justice of God implies that he will fulfil those expectations which he has raised in his creatures is likewise expressly asserted in the scriptures  I will not leave thee  said he to Jacob  until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of  Thy councils of old are faithfulness and truth  Isa  xxv  All the promises of God in him are yea and in him amen unto the glory of God    Cor  i  The LORD thy God he is God the faithful God  Deuteron  vii  More testimonies from the sacred writings will come in our way as we proceed At present we see that the scriptural accounts of the Justice of God do not any more than the positive deductions of Reason represent him in a forbidding but on the contrary in an endearing light encourage our trust and confidence in him and lead us if we love him and keep his commandments to cast all our cares and burthens upon him If we search the scriptures from beginning to end we shall not meet with a single passage which informs us that he cannot pardon the least transgression without a proportionable recompence but on the contrary that  he knoweth our frame and remembereth that we are dust  that he will not therefore make a rigorous enquiry into our past transgressions but that  if we turn unto him he will turn unto us  and that if the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness which he has committed He  will  abundantly pardon and save his soul alive  In the scriptures the Justice of God is no where represented as the cause of confusion and terror to the righteous but as their strong hold and security that they shall never be moved Thus we have al+ready seen that Abraham understood it when he pleaded for the people of Sodom and expressed his confidence in God as the Righteous judge of all the earth He did not mean in any part of his address that those righteous persons for whom he pleaded had never sinned in thought word or deed He only supposed that their hearts were right towards God for the present and that of whatever imperfections they had been guilty in time past they were now sincerely devoted to his service Upon this foundation he presumes that it would be  unjust  in God to involve them in the same destruction with the inflexibly impenitent To the same purpose Jehosaphat instructed the judges of Israel  There is no iniquity with the LORD our God nor respect of persons nor taking of gifts  by which he did not mean that the judges should punish with the utmost rigour every misdemeanor in those delinquents that should come before them but only that they should not be biassed by any rewards to wink at the oppression of the innocent or to patronize the evildoer Besides we are repeatedly told that God  delighteth not in the death of a sinner but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live  which could not be the case if the Justice of God was at all repugnant to his mercy Nay when God himself appeals to his justice he not only shews that it was tempered with mercy but that it was wholly regulated by the most tender boundless mercy  Judge I pray you  says he  between me and my  vineyard What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it  Where he signifies that the glory of his justice consists in kindness and compassions and in applying every reasonable means that can be offered for the recovery and salvation of his backsliding people Words cannot more strongly express this sentiment than we find it in  Ezekiel  xviii  Hear now O house of Israel is not my way equal  The  way  or  dispensation  of God referred to here is that the children should not bear the iniquities of the fathers that the soul which sinned alone should die and that God has not any pleasure at all that the wicked should die but rather that they should turn from their evil ways and live Are not my ways equal Am not I just when instead of punishing one for the iniquities of another or rigorously marking every iniquity committed against my authority I am even willing to pardon all the transgressions however enormous and inexcusable of the truly penitent But as full a proof as can be given that no implacability is to be included in our ideas of the divine justice is to be drawn from the directions that are given us for our own conduct We learn then that to please God we must not only do justly but likewise love mercy and exercise forgiveness Now here it is evident that if  to do justly  was to punish with rigour every offence committed against us then if we would please God by doing justly we could cxercise no mercy or forgiveness Doing justly therefore can only signify that we do no violence ourselves that we should deprive no fellowcreatures of their rights and privileges but do unto all others as we would that they should do unto us And in this light we are to view the divine justice it is slow to wrath  and keepeth the door of mercy for ever open to the penitent  Because God is LORD of all  as the author of the Book of Wisdom says  it maketh him to be gracious to all  And this  grace  is without respect of persons He regardeth not the high more than the low but as the Apostle Peter says  In every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him  It is not till after repeated trials and men have been guilty of the most daring impieties and become totally abandoned that his judgments take place He is not speedy in executing sentence upon them but chasteneth them by little and little that they might fly from the wrath to come And when he comes forth to judgment we are told and may be assured that every mouth shall be stopped and that none shall be able to accuse him of unrighteousness  He will judge the world in righteousness and the people with equity  When this grand and important day arrives  salvation and glory and honour and power  shall be ascribed  unto the Lord our God for his true and righteous judgments  and it will then be found beyond all question I dare say that God inflicteth punishment even upon the incorrigibly wicked not because his justice cannot pardon but because mercy to the universe renders their punishment necessary and because too perhaps there can be no way consistent with infinite wisdom of making the wicked happy Besides God in punishing the wicked will eminently display his justice in proportioning the punishment of every particular criminal to his lesser or greater degree of impenitency and hardness of heart Those that have sinned without law shall also perish without law and while some are beaten  with many stripes others comparatively speaking shall be beaten with few stripes  With the judgment they judge they shall be judged and with the measure they mete it shall be measured to them again  The same justice also will display itself in rewarding the righteous To some it will be said  Come up hither  He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully While all shall be exempted from every labour pain and sorrow the joy of some shall transcendantly exceed that of others  They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that have turned many to righteousness  and have been righteous themselves  as the stars for ever  The Justice of God will pardon all their infirmities and all their transgressions of which they have repented that is from which they have turned away and according to the works of righteousness which they have done  he will divide to each his portion  His goodness has promised this His justice therefore will bring it to pass Yes Though we have sinned yet if we have forsaken our sins acquired a new heart and a new spirit and approved ourselves holy in all manner of conversation and godliness if in preference to all the honours and riches and pleasures of the world we have by a patient continuance in welldoing sought for glory and honour and immortality then notwithstanding those doings that have not been good and which we have seriously amended God will grant us all we want all the riches of eternal life  He is not unrighteous  as we have already affirmed with the apostle  to forget our labour of love  He is faithful in all his promises and cannot disappoint those hopes nor frustrate those noble expectations which he has raised Nay he will not  only not frustrate those expectations not only give us the victory over death and the grave and introduce us to happiness but  eye has not seen nor ear heard neither has it entered into the heart of man to conceive the things which God has prepared for them that love him Thy righteousness  O Lord  is an everlasting righteousness and thy law is the truth  The heavens  shall declare his righteousness for God is judge himself Lord God of Israel there is no God like thee in heaven above or on earth beneath who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts  Such are the notions which reason and scripture clearly I think lead us to form of the divine justice A great variety of objections however it will possibly be said may still be urged against it With all my heart say I if the objections will go upon the same ground upon which I have endeavoured to tread that is if reason and scripture be the testimonies to which they appeal But the most common objection to this doctrine or the most common argument by which the contrary doctrine is supported is nothing more than an impertinent quotation from the apostle Paul A man rises up and harangues to me upon a multitude of  unintelligibles  ascribes certain random arbitrary decrees to the infinitely wise governor of the universe then describes his justice to be such as I have shewn must be an absolute bar to mercy and after working himself into a tolerable heat by much speaking  Who art thou  says he  that repliest against God  Now to such a reasoner I have only to say  Infallible Sir though thou art a God to thyself thou art not my God  But farther it cannot be seriously objected to the doctrine I have been vindicating  that the wicked frequently bear rule in this life  and that their eyes stand out with fatness while the righteous are afflicted and mourn and sometimes go down to the grave labouring under the rod of oppression and sorrow  This I say cannot be seriously objected because this is the very nature of a state of trial Besides amply to satisfy us upon this head it is enough to say that all these things will be set right on a future day and that for every suffering into which we have fallen for righteousness sake or for the trial of our faith we shall be infinitely recompenced at the resurrection of the just Besides we are often in our prosperity too apt to forget God but adversity naturally leads us to the rock that is higher than we The Psalmist therefore said that it was good for him to have been afflicted because that before he was afflicted he went astray Solomon says to the same purpose  My son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be weary of his correction for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth even as a father the son in whom he delighteth  And our own experience testifies that scenes of sorrow naturally humble the mind arrest our wandering desires and dissipated thoughts admonish us of our follies and transgressions and point out to us our true duty and happiness and our only refuge from every calamity It would be unnecessary I hope to make a formal reply to many other equally frivolous objections which the reader can answer as soon as they occur I shall now therefore only conclude with some obvious reflections which naturally arise from what has been said  I would observe first of all that the Justice of God as I have here endeavoured to represent it is like all his other perfections glorious It is not  strict to mark our iniquities It admitteth of grace and reconciliation It is founded on mercy and goodness It is a security to the righteous that they shall never be moved And it is a pledge to the truly penitent of their future crown It is therefore endearing and adorable our refuge in difficulties our hope in trouble our haven of rest from all the storms of life and our tower of defence against every enemy  while we incline our hearts unto the law and to the testimonies  The man whose heart does not condemn him says Abernethy has a confidence toward God because he is a perfectly just governor by whom no service sincerely performed to him nor instance of respect to his commandments will ever be forgottena selfapproving mind is naturally secure supported by this persuasion that right shall finally prevail in the universe and therefore looks forward without consternations to the last result of things when all irregularities shall be rectified when the proud shall be no more prosperous nor innocence oppressed but all men shall receive according to their deeds done in the body and not according to their outward actions only but the prevalent affections and purposes of their hearts  See the following note but one at the beginning    But secondly we should learn from this description of the divine justice what ought to be the rules of justice among men It should have no likeness we see to that narrow unfeeling vindictive spirit which actuates the  priestly  magistrate when the trembling wretch who wanted a morsel of bread is brought before him It should exert its strength against tyranny and oppression against villainy in power And if it should not be allowed to pull down the despotic monarch from his throne and should at the same time most inconsistently and unmercifully wave its heavy scourge over the necessitous delinquent it should not however  transgress the boundaries of plain equity But it is manifestly unjust it is most cruel and iniquitous to put the life of one man upon a level with the property of another to murder the fellowcreature who though wantonly and must unjustifiably and wickedly hath made inroads upon the property of his neighbour This is punishing beyond the utmost stretch of  rigour  and much more beyond the line of  justice  Ye shedders of blood what motives can ye have for still preaching up the doctrine of capital punishments and putting your doctrine in practice Ye cannot plead the prevention of crimes for experience must convince you that all your sanguinary laws are but a feeble fence against the worst crimes And the reason of this is evident Labour and not death is the great evil which the malefactor dreads Make then the malefactor work and you will have no malefactors Nor will ye then while ye would be accounted the servants of Christ most shamefully oppose both the example and the laws of Christ He came not to  destroy  men's lives but to  save  them not to deprive sinners of the power of repenting but to call them to repentance Farther as lewdness debauchery and gambling  these works of dishonesty  lead to the commission of all those other offences that disturb the peace of society let not the example of those in superior stations countenance and encourage those destroying vices Let those of distinguished rank who are too often as eminently infamous once shew themselves  men  and they will find none but  men  among their inferiors  And the divine justice is so far from bearing any kind of similitude to this that it is we have seen entirely contrary to it The divine justice is slow to punish even sinners according to their deserts is forbearing and longsuffering towards them at first only punisheth them with the accusations of conscience to try to reform them time after time useth every possible means to bring them back to their duty and obedience and if they will reform cease to do evil and learn to do well is  ready to blot out all their iniquities to receive them into favour and to admit them to the riches of eternal life We should therefore to copy after the divine justice proportion our mode of punishment to the offence that is committed we should aim at the reformation of the sinner and endeavour to make his situation such as will both answer this end and at the same time repay society for the wrongs he has done Or while we do  justly  towards all and injure no man in body or estate we should likewise shew  mercy  to the guilty and forgive them when they repent  After the author had written these sheets he turned to a discourse of the great Abernethy upon the same subject from whom he has transcribed the following passage being in his apprehension perfectly in point with the sentiments delivered in the above paragraph  God in his justice  said this most learned and excellent man  as well as his other moral perfections is the best example for us to imitate as far as the frailty of our nature will allow It is our glory as reasonable creatures to be capable of imitating him and as our consciences bear as full testimony to the rectitude of this as to any other part of his law written in our hearts we must be selfcondemned and therefore unhappy in acting contrary to it The exercise of human authority should as exactly as possible follow the pattern of that perfect righteousness that governs the world Princes  and magistrates  are called Gods upon earthShall they govern by arbitrary will or by caprice and passion instead of justice  Shall they But how shall we prevail with them or those around them to take the trouble of thinking what is right or of amending what is wrong  But thirdly from the view that we have here taken of the divine justice we may see that there was none occasion for that infinite satisfaction for sin which among many other strange inventions the busy children of men have found out and still confidently proclaim to the world The divine  justice is surrounded with mercy The divine justice therefore is fully satisfied with the reformation of the offender The divine justice sitteth upon a throne of grace to which every contrite sinner has free access has  always  free access And if mercy was not to be obtained thence where else could it possibly be found Could any other being could all the other beings in the universe overpower the infinite mind Could any other being be more benevolent than he Or indeed dare any other being presume to direct him to alter the purpose he had formed But there was not any occasion for any other being to attempt this God was  of himself  eternally disposed to have mercy upon us and was  never  willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance and eternal life Nay so far was he from being irreconcileable to his creatures or from demanding an infinite satisfaction for every sin that he  of his own will gave us his only begotten son  to assure us that upon our sincere repentance all our sins should be blotted out and that upon our renewed obedience we should be made partakers of eternal life  God  so loved the world that  he  gave us his only begotten son that whoever believeth in him might not perish but have everlasting life  Or this is his covenant with us  Repent and live ye  and  turn unto me and I will turn unto you  The blessed Christ has sealed or ratified to us this covenant with his own blood that is by his death and resurrection The everlasting Jehovah has raised Christ from the dead to assure us that he has sent him and that he will consequently fulfil to the truly penitent all those promises of pardon peace and love and everlasting salvation  in the heavens which are given to us in his holy word  Why if such a doctrine has any foundation in truth have we no account in the scriptures of this infinite satisfaction for sin Why if this be necessary to salvation is it not so much as mentioned in those books that are able to make us wise unto salvation Why did not Nathan when he was sent to David to display to him the pardoning mercy of God refer him to such a satisfaction as the only means of escaping the wrath to come Why did not David himself when he humbled himself before God for his great transgression rely upon any such satisfaction nor speak of any such satisfaction but pray for  a clean heart and a right spirit  Why after Christ died did all the apostles instead of referring sinners to such a satisfaction teach them  that denying ungodliness and worldly lust they should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world  Why did Paul in particular who gloried so much in preaching Christ expresly declare that  if while we seek to be justified by Christ we ourselves are found sinners we deceive ourselves  Without shewing at large that this notion of a satisfaction destroys all distinction of character and expunges every idea of the malignity of evil why did not our Lord himself who was the true way to eternal life ever recommend any other means of attaining the mercy of God than a sincere repentance and a thorough reformation He certainly foreknew that he was to suffer death and repeatedly intimated this to his disciples but in none of his conversations upon this subject did he in the least insinuate that his death would be necessary to satisfy the justice of God or that it was to be considered as an indispensable prerequisite to appease his wrath Accordingly he did not pray to God that sinners might learn to rely upon the merits of his blood but that the apostles might be kept from falling and he prayed for all who should believe on him through their word He likewise in the last scene of all prayed for very murderers  Father forgive them for they know not what they do  But to what purpose any of these prayers if the justice of God was fully satisfied by the death of his son Our Lord would not then surely have prayed for criminals but would as he had the spirit above measure and as he could not therefore be deceived have demanded their forgiveness as his purchased right  But finally the doctrine we have been considering can afford no kind of encouragement to the sinner On the contrary the goodness forbearance and longsuffering of God should above all things lead him to repentance Besides though God is gracious slow to anger and ready to forgive yet he will at last take vengeance upon his adversaries upon those who despised his grace and rejected all the offers of his mercy This he hath repeatedly and solemnly declared  There is no peace  saith my God  to the wicked  and  all the workers of iniquity shall be destroyed  If any man serve me  says our Lord  let him follow me and where I am there also shall my servant be If any man serve me him will my Father honourand except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven  Paul says accordingly  If ye live after the flesh ye shall die  and  whoremongers and adulterers God will condemn  And John and all the prophets and apostles teach that  he only who doeth righteousness is righteous  or shall find acceptance at the throne of grace  Since these then are his declarations since judgment will be his work we may assure ourselves that infinite mercy will render judgment necessary and that infinite goodness will execute all the threatenings denounced against the finally impenitent And oh what an aggravation of the wretchedness of the sinners doom will it be that infinite mercy itself could not save him  Let us think of this and as we know not what a day or a night may bring forth let us now in the accepted time seek the Lord while he may be found desire his favour better than life and run with pleasure in the way of all his commandments that we may hereafter receive those crowns which  he has promised and prepared for those that love him that we may drink for ever at the river of his pleasure  Praise our God all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great  Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth Let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him  Let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad let the sea roar and the fulness thereof let the field be joyful and all that is therein then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord for he cometh for he cometh to judge the earth HE SHALL JUDGE THE WORLD WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE PEOPLE WITH HIS TRUTH  FINIS
