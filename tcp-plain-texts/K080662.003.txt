summer it retires northward to breed continues the whole year in the  Orknies  and has been shot in the  Hebrides  in summer it frequents rivers and lakes and feeds on fish In winter it appears about  Sandwich  with the Smew Redbreasted Merganser and other water birds  It is common in the northern parts of the Continent of  Europe  and  Asia  In summer is found in  Iceland Greenland Lapland  and other  Arctic  regions where it rears it's young but migrates towards the south as the winter season approaches In  America  also it aban∣dons the more northern parts in winter  Length of this Bird is twentyeight inches breadth forty weight nearly four pounds  The Bird we have figured is generally considered as the male and the DunDiver as the female of the same species and among the more respectable Naturalists who have held this opinion we must place Linnaeus and since his time Mr Pennant  Willoughby does not seem inclined to adopt this opinion implicitly he says "In the  DunDiver  which we take to be the  female  of the  Goosander  we found a  large laby∣rinth  so that we will not be very confident that the  Goosander  and  DunDiver  differ no more than in sex"  Orn p    Mr Latham  to whose abilities and attention the science of Ornithology is so much indebted has however endeavoured to prove not only that they are two distinct species but that the Mergus Castor of Linnaeus is a mere variety  The specimen Mr Latham describes was killed on the coast of  Suffolk  it was no bigger than the  Smew  but agreed in the general colour of its plumage with the  DunDiver  except the neck which had a greater mixture of ashcolour and that it had a pale streak between the nostrils and eye  of the DunDiver or supposed female of the Mergus Merganser our present species  Mr Latham also observes among other minute particulars that the DunDiver is ever less than the Goosander and individuals of that bird differ greatly in size that in one specimen the crest of the sup∣posed female was longer and fuller than in that thought to be the male a circumstance observed in no other bird that is furnished with a crest for in such the females in many cases have not even the rudiment of one He says also on the authority of Dr Heysham that the DunDiver is infinitely more common in  Cum∣berland  than the Goosander at least ten or fifteen of the first to one of the last And he farther adds in the Supplement "I have been lately informed by Dr  Heysham  that he some time since dis∣sected two  DunDivers  the one weighing about two pounds this proved a  female  the eggs numerous and appearing very distinct The other bird being much larger weighed full three pounds The crest in this was longer than that of the other and the belly of a bright buff colour This proved on dissection a  male  "  PLATE L EMBERIZA MILIARIA COMMON BUNTING PASSERES  Bill conic pointed Nostrils oval broad naked  GENERIC CHARACTER  Bill conic angular on each side a hard knob within the upper

in  Shrewsbury  on the banks of the  Severn  This account together with a general description and drawing of the bird was communi∣cated by Mr  Plymley  of  Lagnor Shropshire  to Mr Pennant who inserted them in the Appendix to his British Zoology  Published in    Additional authority is also given to this circumstance by Mr Latham in the fifth volume of the Synopsis of Birds he says "another specimen was killed in near  Christ Church  in  Hampshire  now    in the Museum of Mr  Turnstall  " He observes they have been found frequently in Arabia but are scarce in other parts In  France  are

were shot in Scotland another was shot a few years ago on  StantonHarcourt  Common near Oxford  Pennant Br Zool  and Mr  White  bookseller of Fleetstreet has a specimen which was shot out of a flock of six or seven in  Frenchmanponds  in  Hampshire  This bird does not perfectly agree in it's plumage with our specimen but is no doubt only a mere difference in the sex  According to Latham it is common in  Egypt  plentiful about the salt lakes and often on the shores of the Caspian Sea and in the southern deserts of  Independent Tartary  Found also at  Madras  in the  East Indies  and in the

the water it lays five or six eggs of a dirty yellowish white colour which are kept constantly wet by the water that rises through the nest the natural warmth of the Bird when sitting excites a

four feet six inches weight sixteen pounds  It is far from common on our shores and is entirely confined to the northern parts of the island except in very severe winters If we consider the authority of Albin worth quoting on this occasion we may conclude it was scarcely known as a native of this country in his time he has given a figure of it in the third volume plate and says "It was brought from  Newfoundland  and presented to the  Right Honourable the Lord Ilay  who was pleased to lend it me to draw its picture" Willoughby mentions one being taken in the island of Jersey and Latham in a note says "One of these was caught alive near  Keswick  in  Cumberland  in  July  It was as is supposed making for the lake but grew tired before it had power to reach it  Dr Heysham  "  This last circumstance is very remarkable as it lives for the most part on the open sea and except in the breeding season seldom frequents fresh waters nor are we certain whether it breeds on our coasts as many water birds migrate to  Norway Iceland Greenland  c to breed and this species is always found common in those northern regions  Pennant  says in  Scotland  it is called  Murbuachaill  or  Herdsman  of

craggy rocks on our coasts They appear in the British seas early in February but do not inhabit their breeding places till May The female lays only one egg but that is of an extraordinary size compared with the bird being three inches long it is of a pale sea green irregularly spotted with black sometimes the ground colour is white They build no nest but lay the egg on the bare rock so close to the verge of the precipice that if it is the least disturbed human ability can rarely place it on its former equilibrium If the first egg is destroyed or taken away it lays a second and sometimes a third if the second is missing  These eggs are so eagerly sought after by the inhabitants of the sea coast that they often brave the greatest dangers to find them and not unfrequently sacrifice their lives in the attempt The usual method of taking them is for two persons having a rope tied round  the middle of each to stand close to the edge of the precipice and one to lower the other down gradually the person above holding the rope as fast as possible whilst the other collects the eggs It however often happens in this perilous situation that the weight of the lowest overbalances the strength of his companion above and both are forced down the precipice where they must inevitably be dashed to pieces  The Razorbill is found very common in the north of Europe in  Iceland Greenland  c They extend along the  White Sea  into the  Arctic Asiatic  shores and from thence to  Kamtschàtkà  and the gulph of  Achotka  Latham Arct Zool c    Latham mentions in his Supplement the following curious par∣ticular of this species "The method this bird takes in fishing is rather singular often diving and catching several small fish which it is observed to range on each side of the bill with the head in the mouth and the tails hanging out on each side of the bill and when the mouth can hold no more the bird retires to the rocks to swallow them at leisure"  PLATE

them as the two sexes of Mergus Merganser and the authority of Linnaeus may also be quoted to sanction this opinion Yet Latham has endeavoured to prove by the most satisfactory experiments that they are distinct species and that  Mergus Castor  is only a variety of the DunDiver Thus perplexed between such opposite opinions both of which are advanced by the most respec∣table naturalists we can scarcely determine to which opinion we should incline but as the observation of Dr Heysham  Vide Description of Mergus Merganser pl    most evi∣dently  tends to confirm the opinion of Mr Latham we

they perfectly agree this part which is about three inches and a half long is of a substance like whalebone it is very slender and compressed is flexible and unlike the bills of other birds turns up towards the end and tapers to a point  This bird is common in winter on the eastern coasts of this king∣dom particularly on those of  Suffolk  and  Norfolk  and sometimes on the lakes of  Shropshire  They are found in great plenty in the breeding season in the fens in  Fossdike Wash  in  Lincolnshire  and in the fens of  Cambridgeshire  and  Suffolk  They feed on worms and insects which they scoop out of the mud and sand and are some∣times observed to wade or swim but always close to the shores  They lay two eggs about the size of those of a pigeon  Pennant  says they are white tinged with green and marked with large black spots In the description given by  Latham  he observes they are of a cinereous grey whimsically marked with deep brownish black patches of irregular sizes and shapes besides some under markings of a dusky hue  The Avoset is far more frequent in some parts of Europe than in England Albin says in  Rome  and  Venice  they are common Salerne writes in the breeding time they are so plenty on the coasts of  Bas Poictou  that the peasants take their eggs by thousands They are found also in  Russia  and  Siberia Denmark Sweden  and other northern countries  PLATE

they are so exquisitely softened neatly speckled and elegantly interspersed and varied with streaks and waves of black that no description can convey a just idea of its beautiful appearance  It has many characters of the Swallow tribe Klein has placed it in that genus and distinguishes it by its undivided tail from the other species and Pennant says it may with justice be called the  Nocturnal Swallow  as it differs from the Swallows chiefly in the time of its flight the latter being on the wing in the day and the GoatSucker only in the evening It agrees in several re∣spects also with the Owl tribe Its manners are much the same in most countries in Europe it retires into some dark recess in forests woods or among rocks and never ventures out in the day time but in very gloomy weather or when disturbed As it can see best in the twilight it comes out in the dusk of the evening and morning and collects its food this it does chiefly on the wing when it finds abundance of moths and other insects stirring In the month of July it is said to live entirely on the dorr beetle or cockchaffer  Scarabaeus Melontha  and from this circumstance Charlton has called it the DorrHawk  The notes of this bird are of two kinds "the loudest" says Pennant "so much resembles that of a large spinningwheel that the Welch call this bird  aderyny droell  or the  Wheel Bird  " And he farther adds "it begins its song most punctually on the close of  day sitting usually on a bare bough with its head lower than the tail the lower jaw quivering with the efforts The noise is so very violent as to give a sensible vibration to any little building it chances to alight on and emit this species of note The other is a sharp squeak which it repeats often this seems to be a note of love as it is observed to reiterate it when in pursuit of the female among the trees"  The male is distinguished from the female by a large oval white spot situated on the inner web of the first three quill feathers and another at the ends of the two exterior feathers of the tail  The bill is alike in both male and female it is short but the gape is remarkably wide It is probably from the structure of the mouth that the ancients supposed this bird sucked the teats of goats In the days of Aristotle this ridiculous notion was generally preva∣lent but among modern naturalists none except  Scopoli  seems in∣clined to credit such an opinion  The female makes no nest but lays her eggs on the bare ground They are usually two in number of a whitish hue and marbled with brown  This is a very confined genus Latham enumerates including his supplementary volume but seventeen species and of these we find only our present subject mentioned as a native of Europe It appears to be an inhabitant of every country on the continent but is very sparingly diffused in some parts and no where common it is also said to inhabit  Africa  and  Asia Sonnerat  met with one on the coast of Coromandel With us it is a bird of passage and arrives about the latter end of May It entirely disappears in the northern  parts of the kingdom in August but does not quit the southern parts till September  The size of this species is ten inches and a half breadth twenty two inches and a half weight two ounces and three quarters  PLATE LXVIII PODICEPS CRISTATUS CRESTED GREBE ANSERES  Bill obtuse covered with a thin

This is the largest bird of the genus that inhabits Great Britain its length is twentythree inches weight two pounds and a half  The extraordinary length of the neck and remarkable structure of the feet give it a most aukward yet singular appearance The breast and belly is of a very beautiful silvery white intermixed with shades of pale ferruginous colour and has a gloss like sattin these skins are in much request and like those of the Grebe of Geneva are made into muffs tippets c In February the skins lose the bright co∣lour and in the breeding time the breast is almost bare  Mr Latham gives a minute account of the plumage of this species in several stages of life he says "At first they are perfectly downy and striped especially down the neck with black after this when about half grown the stripes on the neck are less distinct being rather mottled than striped and the under parts though white is clouded with dusky at this period a fullness round the head is ob∣served as the bird advances still further towards perfection the brown and white appears clear and distinct the head becomes much tufted and the horns are a little elongated But we have great reason to believe that the bird does not obtain the full and perfect crest till the second year at least"  This species is common in some parts of this country They breed in the meres of  Shropshire  and  Cheshire  and in the  east  fen of  Lin∣colnshire  They are called by the country people of this part  Gaunts  The female lays four white eggs the size of those of a pigeon the nest in which they are deposited like others of the Grebe kind are composed of different kinds of water plants such as the stalks of the  Water Lily Pond Weed  c carelessly put to∣gether and left floating on the water among the flags and rushes The old bird feeds on small fish when the young brood is hatched  they are fed upon small eels This bird is rarely seen on the land and though common it is very difficult to be shot as it darts into the water on the least appearance of danger and seldom flies farther than the end of the lake it frequents  Pennant    PLATE LXIX PARUS MAJOR GREAT TITMOUSE PASSERES  Bill conic pointed Nostrils

it's feet it differs from all other birds of prey the outer toe turns backwards and the claw belonging to it is larger than that of the inner toe  It frequents the seashores rivers and lakes Some authors say it feeds on waterfowl but its chief food is fish and these it does not take by swimming but hovering in the air with its eye directed into the water it soon discovers it's prey when precipitating like light∣ning upon it it brings the fish up in its talons and retires to a dis∣tance to devour it The Italians call it the  Leaden Eagle  because it descends with so much violence on its prey and Latham has adopted with an among his synonyms the account of  Kolben  of a bird he supposes the Osprey  Kolben  observes "That it is of all birds the most destructive to the  Flyingfish  taking them during their rise from the water"  Pennant says it builds it's nest on the ground among reeds and lays three or four white eggs of an elliptical form rather less than those of a hen  Ancient writers have asserted that the left foot is  subpalmated  many respectable Naturalists of late years have followed this opi∣nion and indeed the  authority  of  Linneus  had almost finally sanc∣tioned this error  Pennant  contradicts this opinion and gives a faithful description of the bird and  Latham  has added a very cu∣rious and interesting note to his account of it  "I do not believe" says Mr Latham "that there is either bird or quadruped in which each side of the body does not correspond in size and shape in a natural state though the contrary is sometimes seen in the insect tribe" He further adds "In respect to winged insects it is observed that even the marks of the wings exactly correspond on each side Indeed a singular circumstance occurs in one of the BLATTA

permanent distinctions of species"  which is cer∣tainly an apology in some measure for the mistake in the first instance since a bird perfectly according with the description given by early writers may have occurred We cannot suppose without some good authority in ancient writers Linneus would have adopted their errors  PLATE LXXI ANAS TARDONA SHIELDRAKE ANSERES  Bill obtuse covered with a thin

sixteen eggs of a roundish form and white colour These are deposited at the farthest end of the hole and are carefully covered with fine down which the female supplies from her breast The old Bird is very careful of her little brood and uses many cunning stra∣tagems to draw the attention of any disturber from her young it is even said that if she cannot favor their escape from danger by that means she will carry them away in her bill or on her back The time of sitting on the eggs is about thirty days  Some have attempted to domesticate them by bringing them up under the common Duck but they do not thrive so well as when  they are wild nor will any such attempt be likely to succecd unless it be made in the neighbourhood of the sea The flesh is very rank but their eggs are much esteemed  This
