 NOTES UPON THE TWELVE BOOKS OF PARADISE LOST  Collected from the  SPECTATOR  Written by Mr  ADDISON  LONDON  Printed for JACOB TONSON at  Shakespear's Head  overagainst  KatharineStreet  in the  Strand  MDCCXIX  NOTES Upon the Twelve Books of PARADISE LOST  SPECTATOR N  o    Cedite Romani Scriptores cedite Graii  Propert  _THERE is Nothing in Nature more irksome than general Discourses especially when they turn chiefly upon Words For this Reason I shall wave the Discussion of that Point which was started some Years since Whether  Milton  's  Paradise Lost  may be called an  Heroic Poem  Those who will not give it that Title may call it if they please a  Divine Poem  It will be sufficient to its Perfection if it has in it all the Beauties of the highest Kind of Poetry and as for those who alledge it is not an Heroick Poem  they advance no more to the Diminution of it than if they should say  Adam  is not  Aeneas  nor  Eve Helen  I shall therefore examine it by the Rules of Epic Poetry and see whether it falls short of the  Iliad  or  Aeneid  in the Beauties which are essential to that Kind of Writing The first Thing to be consider'd in an Epic Poem is the Fable which is perfect or imperfect according as the Action which it relates is more or less so This Action should have three Qualifications in it First It should be but One Action Secondly It should be an Entire Action and Thirdly It should be a Great Action To consider the Action of the  Iliad Aeneid  and  Paradise Lost  in these three several Lights  Homer  to preserve the Unity of his Action hastens into the Midst of Things as  Horace  has observed Had he gone up to  Leda  's Egg or begun much later even at the Rape of  Helen  or the Investing of  Troy  it is manifest that the Story of the Poem would have been a Series of Several Actions He therefore opens his Poem with the Discord of his Princes and artfully interweaves in the several succeeding Parts of it an Account of every Thing material which relates to them and had passed before this fatal Dissension After the same Manner  Aeneas  makes his first Appearance in the  Tyrrhene  Seas and within Sight of  Italy  because the Action proposed to be celebrated was that of his settling himself in  Latium  But because it was necessary for the Reader to know what had happened to him in the taking of  Troy  and in the preceding Parts of his Voyage  Virgil  makes his Heroe relate it by Way of Episode in the second and third Books of the  Aeneid  the Contents of both which Books come before those of the first Book in the Thread of the Story tho' for preserving of this Unity of Action they follow  it in the Disposition of the Poem  Milton  in Imitation of these two great Poets opens his  Paradise Lost  with an infernal Council plotting the Fall of Man which is the Action he proposed to celebrate and as for those Great Actions the Battle of the Angels and the Creation of the World which preceded in Point of Time and which in my Opinion would have entirely destroyed the Unity of his Principal Action had he related them in the same Order that they happened he cast them into the fifth sixth and seventh Books by way of Episode to this noble Poem  Vid the End of  Spect    ARISTOTLE  himself allows that  Homer  has nothing to boast of as to the Unity of his Fable tho' at the same Time that great Critick and Philosopher endeavours to palliate this Imperfection in the  Greek  Poet by imputing it in some Measure to the very Nature of an Epic Poem Some have been of Opinion that the  Aeneid  also labours in this Particular and has Episodes which may be looked upon as Excrescencies rather than as Parts of the Action On the contrary the Poem which we have now under our Consideration hath no other Episodes than such as naturally arise from the Subject and yet is filled with such a Multitude of astonishing Incidents that it gives us at the same Time a Pleasure of the greatest Variety and of the greatest Simplicity uniform in its Nature tho' diversified in the Execution  I must observe also that as  Virgil  in the Poem which was designed to celebrate the Original of the  Roman  Empire has described the Birth of its great Rival the  Carthaginian  Commonwealth  Milton  with the like Art in his Poem on the Fall of Man has related the Fall of those Angels who are his professed Enemies Beside the many other Beauties in such an Episode it's running parallel  with the great Action of the Poem hinders it from breaking the Unity so much as another Episode would have done that had not so great an Affinity with the principal Subject In short this is the same Kind of Beauty which the Criticks admire in the  Spanish Fryar  or the  Double Discovery  where the two different Plots look like Counterparts and Copies of one another  THE second Qualification required in the Action of an Epic Poem is that it should be an  entire  Action An Action is entire when it is compleat in all its Parts or as  Aristotle  describes it when it consists of a Beginning a Middle and an End Nothing should go before it be intermix'd with it or follow after it that is not related to it As on the contrary no single Step should be omitted in that just and regular Progress which it must be supposed to take from its Original to its Consummation Thus we see the Anger of  Achilles  in its Birth its Continuance and Effects and  Aeneas  's Settlement in  Italy  carried on through all the Oppositions in his Way to it both by Sea and Land The Action in  Milton  excells I think both the former in this Particular we see it contrived in Hell executed upon Earth and punished by Heaven The Parts of it are told in the most distinct Manner and grow out of one another in the most natural Order  THE third Qualification of an Epic Poem is its  Greatness  The Anger of  Achilles  was of such Consequence that it embroiled the Kings of  Greece  destroy'd the Heroes of  Asia  and engaged all the Gods in Factions  Aeneas  's Settlement in  Italy  produc'd the  Caesars  and gave Birth to the  Roman  Empire  Milton  's Subject was still greater than either of the former it does not determine the Fate of single Persons or Nations but of a whole Species The United Powers of Hell are joined together  for the Destruction of Mankind which they effected in Part and would have completed had not Omnipotence it self interposed The principal Actors are Man in his greatest Perfection and Woman in her highest Beauty Their Enemies are the fallen Angels The Messiah their Friend and the Almighty their Protector In short every Thing that is great in the whole Circle of Being whether within the Verge of Nature or out of it has a proper Part assigned it in this admirable Poem  IN Poetry as in Architecture not only the Whole but the principal Members and every Part of them should be Great I will not presume to say that the Book of Games in the  Aeueid  or that in the  Iliad  are not of this Nature nor to reprehend  Virgil  's Simile of the Top and many other of the same Kind in the  Iliad  as liable to any Censure in this Particular but I think We may say without derogating from those wonderful Performances that there is an Indisputable and Unquestioned Magnificence in every Part of  Paradise Lost  and indeed a much greater than could have been formed upon any Pagan System  BUT  Aristotle  by the Greatness of the Action does not only mean that it should be great in its Nature but also in its Duration or in other Words That it should have a due Length in it as well as what we properly call Greatness The just Measure of this Kind of Magnitude he explains by the following Similitude An Animal no bigger than a Mite cannot appear perfect to the Eye because the Sight takes it in at once and has only a confused Idea of the Whole and not a distinct Idea of all its Parts If on the contrary you should suppose an Animal of ten thousand Furlongs in Length the Eye would be so filled with a single Part of it that it could not give the Mind an Idea of the whole What these Animals  are to the Eye a very short or a very long Action would be to the Memory The first would be as it were lost and swallowed up by it and the other difficult to be contained in it  Homer  and  Virgil  have shewn their principal Art in this Particular the Action of the  Iliad  and that of the  Aeneid  were in themselves exceeding short but are so beautifully extended and diversified by the Invention of  Episodes  and the Machinery of Gods with the like poetical Ornaments that they make up an agreeable Story sufficient to employ the Memory without overcharging it  Milton  's Action is enriched with such a Variety of Circumstances that I have taken as much Pleasure in reading the Contents of his Books as in the best invented Story I ever met with It is possible that the Traditions on which the  Iliad  and  Aeneid  were built had more Circumstances in them than the History of  the Fall of Man  as it is related in Scripture Besides it was easier for  Homer  and  Virgil  to dash the Truth with Fiction as they were in no Danger of offending the Religion of their Country by it But as for  Milton  he had not only a very few Circumstances upon which to raise his Poem but was also obliged to proceed with the greatest Caution in every Thing that he added out of his own Invention And indeed notwithstanding all the Restraints he was under he has filled his Story with so many surprising Incidents which bear so close Analogy with what is delivered in Holy Writ that it is capable of pleasing the most delicate Reader without giving Offence to the most scrupulous  THE modern Criticks have collected from several Hints in the  Iliad  and  Aeneid  the Space of Time which is taken up by the Action of each of those Poems but as a great Part of  Milton  's Story was transacted in Regions that lie out of the Reach of the Sun and the Sphere of Day  it is impossible to gratifie the Reader with such a Calculation which indeed would be more curious than instructive None of the Criticks either Antient or Modern having laid down Rules to circumscribe the Action of an Epic Poem with any Determined Number of Years Days or Hours  Vid  Spect    But of this more particularly hereafter  SPECTATOR N  o    Notandi sunt tibi  Mores  Hor  HAVING examined the Action of  Paradise Lost  let us in the next Place consider the Actors This is  Aristotle  's Method of considering first the Fable and secondly the Manners or as we generally call them in  English  the Fable and the Characters  HOMER  has excelled all the Heroic Poets that ever wrote in the Multitude and Variety of his Characters Every God that is admitted into his Poem acts a Part which would have been suitable to no other Deity His Princes are as much distinguished by their Manners as by their Dominions and even those among them whose Characters seem wholly made up of Courage differ from one another as to the particular Kinds of Courage in which they excel In short there is scarce a Speech or Action in the  Iliad  which the Reader may not ascribe to the Person that speaks or acts without seeing his Name at the Head of it  HOMER  does not only outshine all other Poets in the Variety but also in the Novelty of his Characters He has introduced among his  Grecian  Princes a Person who had lived in three Ages of Men and conversed with  Theseus Hercules Polyphenius  and the first Race of Heroes His principal Actor is the Son of a Goddess not to mention the Offspring of other Deities who have likewise a Place in his Poem and the venerable  Trojan  Prince who was the Father of so many Kings and Heroes There is in these several Characters of  Homer  a certain Dignity as well as Novelty which adapts them in a more peculiar Manner to the Nature of an heroic Poem Tho' at the same Time to give them the greater Variety he has described a  Vulcan  that is a Buffoon among his Gods and a  Thersites  among his Mortals  VIRGIL  falls infinitely short of  Homer  in the Characters of his Poem both as to their Variety and Novelty  Aeneas  is indeed a perfect Character but as for  Achates  tho' he is stiled the Heroe's Friend he does nothing in the whole Poem which may deserve that Title  Gyas Mnestheus Sergestus  and  Cloenthus  are all of them Men of the same Stamp and Character  fortemque Gyan fortemque Cloanthum  Virg  THERE are indeed several very natural Incidents in the Part of  Ascanius  as that of  Dido  cannot be sufficiently admired I do not see any Thing new or particular in  Turnus Pallas  and  Evander  are remote Copies of  Hector  and  Priam  as  Lausus  and  Mezentius  are almost Parallels to  Pallas  and  Evander  The Characters of  Nisus  and  Eurialus  are beautiful but common We must not forget the Parts of  Sinon Camilla  and some few others which are fine Improvements on the Greek Poet  In short there is neither that Variety nor Novelty in the Persons of the  Aeneid  which we meet with in those of the  Iliad  IF we look into the Characters of  Milton  we shall find that he has introduced all the Variety his Fable was capable of receiving The whole Species of Mankind was in two Persons at the Time to which the Subject of his Poem is confined We have however four distinct Characters in these two Persons We see Man and Woman in the highest Innocence and Perfection and in the most abject State of Guilt and Infirmity The two last Characters are indeed very common and obvious but the two first are not only more magnificent but more new than any Characters either in  Virgil  or  Homer  or indeed in the whole Circle of Nature  MILTON  was so sensible of this Defect in the Subject of his Poem and of the few Characters it would afford him that he has brought into it two Actors of a shadowy and fictitious Nature in the Persons of Sin and Death by which Means he has wrought into the Body of his Fable a very beautiful and wellinvented Allegory  Vid Spect  But notwithstanding the Fineness of this Allegory may atone for it in some Measure I cannot think that Persons of such a chimerical Existence are proper Actors in an Epic Poem because there is not that Measure of Probability annexed to them which is requisite in Writings of this Kind as I shall shew more at large hereafter  VIRGIL  has indeed admitted  Fame  as an Actress in the  Aeneid  but the Part she acts is very short and none of the most admired Circumstances in that Divine Work We find in MockHeroic Poems particularly in the  Dispensary  and the  Lutrin  several allegorical Persons of this Nature which are very beautiful in those Compositions and  may perhaps be used as an Argument that the Authors of them were of Opinion such Characters might have a Place in an Epic Work For my own Part I should be glad the Reader would think so for the Sake of the Poem I am now examining and must further add that if such empty unsubstantial Beings may be ever made Use of on this Occasion never were any more nicely imagined and employed in more proper Actions than those of which I am now speaking  ANOTHER principal Actor in this Poem is the great Enemy of Mankind The Part of  Ʋlysses  in  Homer  's  Odyssey  is very much admired by  Aristotle  as perplexing that Fable with very agreeable Plots and Intricacies not only by the many Adventures in his Voyage and the Subtilty of his Behaviour but by the various Concealments and Discoveries of his Person in several Parts of that Poem But the crafty Being I have now mentioned makes a much longer Voyage than  Ʋlysses  puts in Practice many more Wiles and Stratagems and hides himself under a greater Variety of Shapes and Appearances all of which are severally detected to the great Delight and Surptise of the Reader  WE may likewise observe with how much Art the Poet has varied several Characters of the Persons that speak in his infernal Assembly On the contrary how has he represented the whole Godhead exerting it self towards Man in its full Benevolence under the Threefold Distinction of a Creator a Redeemer and a Comforter  NOR must we omit the Person of  Raphael  who amidst his Tenderness and Friendship for Man shews such a Dignity and Condescention in all his Speech and Behaviour as are suitable to a superior Nature The Angels are indeed as much diversified in  Milton  and distinguished by their proper Parts as the Gods are in  Homer  or  Virgil  The Reader  will find nothing ascribed to  Ʋriel Gabriel Michael  or  Raphael  which is not in a particular manner suitable to their respective Characters  THERE is another Circumstance in the principal Actors of the  Iliad  and  Aeneid  which give a peculiar Beauty to those two Poems and was therefore contrived with very great Judgment I mean the Authors having chosen for their Heroes Persons who were so nearly related to the People for whom they wrote  Achilles  was a  Greek  and  Aeneas  the remote Founder of  Rome  By this Means their Countrymen whom they principally proposed to themselves for their Readers were particularly attentive to all the Parts of their Story and sympathized with their Heroes in all their Adventures A  Roman  could not but rejoice in the Escapes Successes and Victories of  Aeneas  and be grieved at any Defeats Misfortunes or Disappointments that befel him as a  Greek  must have had the same Regard for  Achilles  And it is plain that each of those Poems have lost this great Advantage among those Readers to whom their Heroes are as Strangers or indifferent Persons  MILTON  's Poem is admirable in this respect since it is impossible for any of its Readers whatever Nation Country or People he may belong to not to be related to the Persons who are the principal Actors in it but what is still infinitely more to its Advantage the principal Actors in this Poem are not only our Progenitors but our Representatives We have an Actual Interest in every Thing they do and no less than our utmost Happiness is concerned and lies at Stake in all their Behaviour  I shall subjoin as a Corollary to the foregoing Remark an admirable Observation out of  Aristotle  which hath been very much misrepresented in the Quotations of some Modern Criticks  'If a Man  of perfect and consummate Virtue falls into a Misfortune it raises our Pity but not our Terror because we do not fear that it may be our own Case who do not resemble the suffering Person'  But as that great Philosopher adds  'If we see a Man of Virtue mixt with Infirmities fall into any Misfortune it does not only raise our Pity but our Terror because we are afraid that the like Misfortunes may happen to our selves who resemble the Character of the suffering Person'  I shall only remark in this Place that the foregoing Observation of  Aristotle  tho' it may be true in other Occasions does not hold in this because in the present Case though the Persons who fall into Misfortune are of the most perfect and consummate Virtue it is not to be considered as what may possibly be but what actually is our own Case since we are embark'd with them on the same Bottom and must be Partakers of their Happiness or Misery  IN this and some other very few Instances  Aristotle  's Rules for Epic Poetry which he had drawn from his Reflections upon  Homer  cannot be supposed to square exactly with the heroic Poems which have been made since his Time since it is evident to every impartial Judge his Rules would still have been more perfect could he have perused the  Aeneid  which was made some hundred years after his Death  IN my next I shall go through other Parts of  Miltan  's Poem and hope that what I shall there advance as well as what I have already written will not only serve as a Comment upon  Milton  but upon  Aristotle  SPECTATOR N  o    Reddere personae scit convenientia cuique  Hor  WE have already taken a general Survey of the Fable and Characters in  Milton  's  Paradise Lost  The Parts which remain to be consider'd according to  Aristotle  's Method are the  Sentiments  and the  Language  Before I enter upon the first of these I must advertise my Reader that it is my Design as soon as I have finished my general Reflections on these four several Heads to give particular Instances out of the Poem now before us of Beauties and Imperfections which may be observed under each of them as also of such other Particulars as may not properly fall under any of them This I thought fit to premise that the Reader may not judge too hastily of this Piece of Criticism or look upon it as imperfect before he has seen the whole Extent of it  THE Sentiments in an Epic Poem are the Thoughts and Behaviour which the Author ascribes to the Persons whom he introduces and are  just  when they are conformable to the Characters of the several Persons The Sentiments have likewise a Relation to  Things  as well as  Persons  and are then perfect when they are such as are adapted to the Subject If in either of these Cases the Poet endeavours to argue or explain to magnifie or diminish to raise Love or Hatred Pity or Terror or any other Passion we ought to consider whether the Sentiments he makes Use of are proper for those Ends  Homer  is censured by the Criticks for his  Defect as to this Particular in several Parts of the  Iliad  and  Odyssey  tho' at the same Time those who have treated this great Poet with Candour have attributed this Defect to the Times in which he lived It was the Fault of the Age and not of  Homer  if there wants that Delicacy in some of his Sentiments which now appears in the Works of Men of a much inferior Genius Besides if there are Blemishes in any particular Thoughts there is an infinite Beauty in the greatest Part of them In short if there are many Poets who would not have fallen into the Meanness of some of his Sentiments there are none who could have risen up to the Greatness of others  Virgil  has excelled all others in the Propriety of his Sentiments  Milton  shines likewise very much in this Particular Nor must me omit one Consideration which adds to his Honour and Reputation  Homer  and  Virgil  introduced Persons whose Characters are commonly known among Men and such as are to be met with either in History or in ordinary Conversation  Milton  's Characters most of them lie out of Nature and were to be formed purely by his own Invention It shews a greater Genius in  Shakespear  to have drawn his  Calyban  than this  Hotspur  or  Julius Caesar  The one was to be supplied out of his own Imagination whereas the other might have been formed upon Tradition History and Observation It was much easier therefore for  Homer  to find proper Sentiments for an Assembly of  Grecian  Generals than for  Milton  to diversifie his infernal Council with proper Characters and inspire them with a Variety of Sentiments The Loves of  Dido  and  Aeneas  are only Copies of what has passed between other Persons  Adam  and  Eve  before the Fall are a different Species from that of Mankind who are descended from them and none but a Poet of the most unbounded Invention and the most exqu site  Judgment cou'd have filled their Conversation and Behaviour with so many apt Circumstances during their State of Innocence  NOR is it sufficient for an Epic Poem to be filled with such Thoughts as are  natural  unless it abound also with such as are  sublime Virgil  in this Particular falls short of  Homer  He has not indeed so many Thoughts that are low and vulgar but at the same Time has not so many Thoughts that are sublime and noble The Truth of it is  Virgil  seldom rises into very astonishing Sentiments where he is not fired by the  Iliad  He every where charms and pleases us by the Force of his own Genius but seldom elevates and transports us where he does not fetch his Hints from  Homer  MILTON  's chief Talent and indeed his distinguishing Excellence lies in the Sublimity of his Thoughts There are others of the Moderns who rival him in every other Part of Poetry but in the Greatness of his Sentiments he triumphs over all the Poets both Modern and Ancient  Homer  only excepted It is impossible for the Imagination of Man to distend it self with greater Ideas than those which he has laid together in his first second and sixth Books The seventh which describes the Creation of the World is likewise wonderfully sublime tho' not so apt to stir up Emotion in the Mind of the Reader nor consequently so perfect in the Epic Way of Writing because it is filled with less Action Let the judicious Reader compare what  Longinus  has observed on several Passages in  Homer  and he will find Parallels for most of them in the  Paradise Lost  FROM what has been said we may infer that as there are two Kinds of Sentiments the Natural and the Sublime which are always to be pursued in an heroic Poem there are also two Kinds of  Thoughts which are carefully to be avoided The first are such as are affected and unnatural the second such as are mean and vulgar As for the first Kind of Thoughts we meet with little or Nothing that is like them in  Virgil  He has none of those trifling Points and Puerilities that are so often to be met with in  Ovid  none of the Epigrammatick Turns of  Lucan  none of those swelling Sentiments which are so frequently in  Statius  and  Claudian  none of those mixed Embellishments of  Tasso  Every Thing is just and natural His Sentiments shew that he had a perfect Insight into humane Nature and that he knew every Thing which was the most proper to affect it  Mr  Dryden  has in some Places which I may hereafter take Notice of misrepresented  Virgil  's Way of Thinking as to this Particular in the Translation he has given us of the  Aeneid  I do not remember that  Homer  any where falls into the Faults abovementioned which were indeed the false Refinements of later Ages  Milton  it must be confest has sometimes erred in this Respect as I shall shew more at large in another Paper tho' considering all the Poets of the Age in which he writ were infected with this wrong Way of Thinking he is rather to be admired that he did not give more into it than that he did sometimes comply with the vicious Taste which still prevails so much among modern Writers  BUT since several Thoughts may be natural which are low and groveling an Epic Poet should not only avoid such Sentiments as are unnatural or affected but also such as are mean and vulgar  Homer  has opened a great Field of Raillery to Men of more Delicacy than Greatness of Genius by the Homeliness of some of his Sentiments But as I have before said these are rather to be imputed to the Simplicity of the Age in which he lived to  which I may also add of that which he described than to any Imperfection in that Divine Poet  Zoilus  among the Ancients and Monsieur  Perrault  among the Moderns pushed their Ridicule very far upon him on Account of some such Sentiments There is no Blemish to be observed in  Virgil  under this Head and but a very few in  Milton  I shall give but one Instance of this Impropriety of Thought in  Homer  and at the same Time compare it with an Instance of the same Nature both in  Virgil  and  Milton  Sentiments which raise Laughter can very seldom be admitted with any Decency into an heroic Poem whose Business is to excite Passions of a much nobler Nature  Homer  however in his Characters of  Vulcan  and  Thersites  in his Story of  Mars  and  Venus  in his Behaviour of  Irus  and in other Passages has been observed to have lapsed into the Burlesque Character and to have departed from that serious Air which seems essential to the Magnificence of an Epic Poem I remember but one Laugh in the whole  Aeneid  which rises in the fifth Book upon  Monoetes  where he is represented as thrown overboard and drying himself upon a Rock But this Piece of Mirth is so well timed that the severest Critick can have Nothing to say against it for it is in the Book of Games and Diversions where the Reader's Mind may be supposed to be sufficiently relaxed for such an Entertainment The only Piece of Pleasantry in  Paradise Lost  is where the evil Spirits are described as rallying the Angels upon the Success of their new invented Artillery This Passage I look upon to be the most exceptionable in the whole Poem as being nothing else but a String of Puns and those too very indifferent  Satan beheld their Plight  And to his Mates thus in Derision call'd  O Friends why come not on these Victors proud  Ere while they fierce were coming and when we  To entertain them

captet  Hor  HAVING already treated of the Fable the Characters and Sentiments in the  Paradise lost  we are in the last Place to consider the  Language  and  as the learned World is very much divided upon  Milton  as to this Point I hope they will excuse me if I appear particular in any of my Opinions and encline to those who judge the most advantagiously of the Author  IT is requisite that the Language of an Heroic Poem should be both Perspicuous and Sublime In Proportion as either of these two Qualities are wanting the Language is imperfect Perspicuity is the first and most necessary Qualification insomuch that a goodnatur'd Reader sometimes overlooks a little Slip even in the Grammer or Syntax where it is impossible for him to mistake the Poet's Sense Of this kind is that Passage in  Milton  wherein he speaks of  Satan  God and his Son except  Created thing nought valu'd he nor shunn'd  And that in which he describes  Adam  and  Eve  Adam  the goodliest Man of Men since born  His Sons the fairest of her Daughters  Eve  IT is plain that in the former of these Passages according to the natural Syntax the Divine Persons mentioned in the first Line are represented as created Beings and that in the other  Adam  and  Eve  are confounded with their Sons and Daughters Such little Blemishes are these when the Thought is great and natural we should with  Horace  impute to a pardonable Inadvertency or to the Weakness of Human Nature which cannot attend to each minute Particular and give the last finishing to every Circumstance in so long a Work The Ancient Criticks therefore who were acted by a Spirit of Candour rather than that of Cavilling invented certain Figures of Speech on purpose to palliate little Errors of this Nature in the Writings of those  Authors who had so many greater Beauties to attone for them  IF Clearness and Perspicuity were only to be consulted the Poet would have nothing else to do but to cloath his Thoughts in the most plain and natural Expressions But since it often happens that the most obvious Phrases and those which are used in ordinary Conversation become too familiar to the Ear and contract a kind of Meanness by passing through the Mouths of the Vulgar a Poet should take particular Care to guard himself against Idiomatick Ways of speaking  Ovid  and  Lucan  have many Poornesses of Expression upon this account as taking up with the first Phrases that offered without putting themselves to the Trouble of looking after such as would not only be natural but also elevated and sublime  Milton  has but a few Failings in this kind of which however you may meet with some Instances as in the following Passages  Embrio's and Idiots Eremites and Fryars  White Black  and  Grey  with all their  Trumpery  Here Pilgrims roam  A while Discourse they hold  No Fear least Dinner cool  when thus began  Our Author  Who of all Ages to succeed but feeling  The Evil on him brought by me will curse  My Head ill fare our Ancestor impure  For this we may thank  Adam  The great Masters in Composition know very well that many an elegant Phrase becomes improper for a Poet or an Orator when it has been debased by common Use For this Reason the Works of Ancient Authors which are written in dead Languages have a great Advantage over those which are written in Languages that are now spoken Were there any Mean Phrases or Idioms in  Virgil  and  Homer  they would not shock the Ear of the most delicate Modern Reader so much as they would have done that of an old  Greek  or  Roman  because we never hear them pronounced in our Streets or in ordinary Conversation  IT is not therefore sufficient that the Language of an Epic Poem be Perspicuous unless it be also Sublime To this End it ought to deviate from the common Forms and ordinary Phrases of Speech The Judgment of a Poet very much discovers it self in shunning the common Roads of Expression without falling into such ways of Speech as may seem stiff and unnatural he must not swell into a false Sublime by endeavouring to avoid the other Extream Among the  Greeks Aeschylus  and some times  Sophocles  were guilty of this Fault among the  Latins Claudian  and  Statius  and among our own Countrymen  Shakespear  and  Lee  In these Authors the Affectation of Greatness often hurts the Perspicuity of the Stile as in many others the Endeavour after Perspicuity prejudices its Greatness  ARISTOTLE  has observed that the Idiomatick Stile may be avoided and the Sublime formed by the following Methods First by the Use of Metaphors such are those in  Milton  Imparadised  in anothers Arms  And in his Hand a Reed  Stood waving  tipt  with Fire  The grassie Clods now  calv'd    Spangled  with Eyes  IN these and innumerable other Instances the Metaphors are very bold but just I must however observe that the Metaphors are not thick sown in  Milton  which always favours too much of Wit that they never clash with one another which as  Aristotle  observes turns a Sentence into a Kind of an Enigma or Riddle and that he seldom has  Recourse to them where the proper and natural Words will do as well  ANOTHER way of raising the Language and giving it a Poetical Turn is to make Use of the Idioms of other Tongues  Virgil  is full of the  Greek  Forms of Speech which the Criticks call  Hellenisms  as  Horace  in his Odes abounds with them much more than  Virgil  I need not mention the several Dialects which  Homer  has made use of for this End  Milton  in Conformity with the Practice of the Ancient Poets and with  Aristotle  's Rule has infused a great many  Latinisms  as well as  Gracisms  and sometimes  Hebraisms  into the Language of his Poem as towards the Beginning of it  Nor  did they  not  perceive the evil plight  In which they were  or  the fierce Pains  not  feel  Yet  to  their Gen'ral's Voice they soon obey'd  Who shall tempt with wandring Fees  The dark unbottom'd Infinite Abyss  And through the  palpable Obscure  find out  His uncouth way or spread his airy Flight  Ʋpborn with indefatigable Wings  Over the vast  Abrupt  So both ascend  In the Visions of God  B  UNDER this Head may be reckoned the placing the Adjective after the Substantive the Transposition of Words the turning the Adjective into a Substantive with several other Foreign Modes of Speech which this Poet has naturalized to give his Verse the greater Sound and throw it out of Prose  THE third Method mentioned by  Aristotle  is what agrees with the Genius of the  Greek  Language more than with that of any other Tongue and is  therefore more used by  Homer  than by any other Poet I mean the lengthning of a Phrase by the Addition of Words which may either be inserted or omitted as also by the extending or contracting of particular Words by the Insertion or Omission of certain Syllables  Milton  has put in practice this Method of raising his Language as far as the Nature of our Tongue will permit as in the Passage abovementioned  Eremite  for what is Hermite in common Discourse If you observe the Measure of his Verse he has with great Judgment suppressed a Syllable in several Words and shortned those of two Syllables into one by which Method besides the abovementioned Advantage he has given a greater Variety to his Numbers But this Practice is more particularly remarkable in the Names of Persons and of Countries as  Beëlzebub Hessebon  and in many other Particulars wherein he has either changed the Name or made use of that which is not the most commonly known that he might the better depart from the Language of the Vulgar  THE same Reason recommended to him several old Words which also makes his Poem appear the more venerable and gives it a greater Air of Antiquity  I must likewise take notice that there are in  Milton  several Words of his own Coining as  Cerberean miscreated helldoom'd Embryon  Atoms and many others If the Reader is offended at this Liberty in our  English  Poet I would recommend him to a Discourse in  Plutarch  which shews us how frequently  Homer  has made use of the same Liberty  MILTON  by the abovementioned Helps and by the Choice of the noblest Words and Phrases which our Tongue would afford him has carried our Language to a greater height than any of the  English  Poets have ever done before or after him  and made the Sublimity of his Stile equal to that of his Sentiments  I have been the more particular in these Observations on  Milton  's  Stile  because it is that part of him in which he appears the most singular The Remarks I have here made upon the Practice of other Poets with my Observations out of  Aristotle  will perhaps alleviate the Prejudice which some have taken to his Poem upon this Account tho' after all I must confess that I think his Stile tho' admirable in general is in some places too much stiffened and obscured by the frequent Use of those Methods which  Aristotle  has prescribed for the raising of it  THIS Redundancy of those several Ways of Speech which  Aristotle  calls  foreign Language  and with which  Milton  has so very much enriched and in some places darkned the Language of his Poem was the more proper for his use because his Poem is written in Blank Verse Rhyme without any other Assistance throws the Language off from Prose and very often makes an indifferent Phrase pass unregarded but where the Verse is not built upon Rhymes there Pomp of Sound and Energy of Expression are indispensably necessary to support the Stile and keep it from falling into the Flatness of Prose  THOSE who have not a Taste for this Elevation of Stile and are apt to ridicule a Poet when he goes out of the common Forms of Expression would do well to see how  Aristotle  has treated an Ancient Author called  Euclid  for his insipid Mirth upon this Occasion Mr  Dryden  used to call this sort of Men his ProseCriticks  I should under this Head of the Language consider  Milton  's Numbers in which he has made use of several Elisions that are not customary among other  English  Poets as may be particularly observed  in his cutting off the Letter  Y  when it precedes a Vowel This and some other Innovations in the Measure of his Verse has varied his Numbers in such a manner as makes them incapable of satiating the Ear and cloying the Reader which the same uniform Measure would certainly have done and which the perpetual Returns of Rhyme never fail to do in long Narrative Poems I shall close these Reflections upon the Language of  Paradise Lost  with observing that  Milton  has copied after  Homer  rather than  Virgil  in the length of his Periods the Copiousness of his Phrases and the running of his Verses into one another  SPECTATOR No  Ʋbi plura nitent in carmine non ego paucis  Offendor maculis quas aut Incuria fudit  Aut Humana parum cavit Natura  Hor  I Have now consider'd  Milton  's  Paradise Lost  under those four great Heads of the Fable the Characters the Sentiments and the Language and have shewn that he excels in general under each of these Heads I hope that I have made several Discoveries which may appear new even to those who are versed in Critical Learning Were I indeed to chuse my Readers by whose Judgment I would stand or fall they should not be such as are acquainted only with the  French  and  Italian  Criticks but also with the Antient and Modern who have  written in either of the learned Languages Above all I would have them well versed in the  Greek  and  Latin  Poets without which a Man very often fancies that he understands a Critick when in reality he does not comprehend his Meaning  IT is in Criticism as in all other Sciences and Speculations one who brings with him any implieit Notions and Observations which he has made in his reading of the Poets will find his own Reflections methodized and explained and perhaps several little Hints that had passed in his Mind perfected and improved in the Works of a good Critick whereas one who has not these previous Lights is very often an utter Stranger to what he reads and apt to put a wrong Interpretation upon it  NOR is it sufficient that a Man who sets up for a Judge in Criticism should have perused the Authors abovementioned unless he has also a clear and logical Head Without this Talent he is perpetually puzzled and perplexed amidst his own Blunders mistakes the Sense of those he would confute or if he chances to think right does not know how to convey his Thoughts to another with Clearness and Perspicuity  Aristotle  who was the best Critick was also one of the best Logicians that ever appeared in the World  Mr  Lock  's Essay on Human Understanding would be thought a very odd Book for a Man to make himself Master of who would get a Reputation by Critical Writings though at the same Time it is very certain that an Author who has not learned the Art of distinguishing between Words and Things and of ranging his Thoughts and setting them in proper Lights whatever Notions he may have will lose himself in Confusion and Obscurity I might further observe that there is not a  Greek  or  Latin  Critick who has not shewn even in the Stile of his Criticisms that he was a Master of all the Elegance and Delicacy of his Native Tongue  THE Truth of it is there is nothing more absurd than for a Man to set up for a Critick without a good Insight into all the Parts of Learning whereas many of those who have endeavoured to signalize themselves by Works of this Nature among our  English  Writers are not only defective in the abovementioned Particulars but plainly discover by the Phrases which they make use of and by their confused way of thinking that they are not acquainted with the most common and ordinary Systems of Arts and Sciences A few general Rules extracted out of the  French  Authors with a certain Cant of Words has sometimes set up an illiterate heavy Writer for a most judicious and formidable Critick  ONE great Mark by which you may discovet a Critick who has neither Taste nor Learning is this that he seldom ventures to praise any Passage in an Author which has not been before received and applauded by the Publick and that his Criticism turns wholly upon little Faults and Errors This Part of a Critick is so very easy to succeed in that we find every ordinary Reader upon the publishing of a new Poem has Wit and Illnature enough to turn several Passages of it into Ridicule and very often in the right Place This Mr  Dryden  has very agreeably remarked in those two celebrated Lines  Errors like Straws upon the Surface flow  He who would search for Pearls must dive below  A true Critick ought to dwell rather upon Excellencies than Imperfections to discover the concealed Beauties of a Writer and communicate to the  World such Things as are worth their Observation The most exquisite Words and finest Strokes of an Author are those which very often appear the most doubtful and exceptionable to a Man who wants a Relish for polite Learning and they are these which a soure undistinguishing Critick generally attacks with the greatest Violence  Tully  observes that it is very easy to brand or fix a Mark upon what he calls  Verbum ardens  or as it may be rendered into  English a glowing bold Expression  and to turn it into Ridicule by a cold illnatured Criticism A little Wit is equally capable of exposing a Beauty and of aggravating a Fault and though such a Treatment of an Author naturally produces Indignation in the Mind of an understanding Reader it has however its Effect among the Generality of those whose Hands it falls into the Rabble of Mankind being very apt to think that every thing which is laughed at with any Mixture of Wit is ridiculous in it self  SUCH a Mirth as this is always unseasonable in a Critick as it rather prejudices the Reader than convinces him and is capable of making a Beauty as well as a Blemish the Subject of Derision A Man who cannot write with Wit on a proper Subject is dull and stupid but one who shews it in an improper Place is as impertinent and absurd Besides a Man who has the Gift of Ridicule is apt to find Fault with any Thing that gives him an Opportunity of exerting his beloved Talent and very often censures a Passage not because there is any Fault in it but because he can be merry upon it Such Kinds of Pleasantry are very unfair and disingenuous in Works of Criticism in which the greatest Masters both antient and modern have always appeared with a serious and instructive Air  AS I intend in my next Paper to shew the Defects in  Milton's Paradise Lost  I thought fit to premise  these few Particulars to the End that the Reader may know I enter upon it as on a very ungrateful Work and that I shall just point at the Imperfections without endeavouring to enflame them with Ridicule I must also observe with  Longinus  that the Productions of a great Genius with many Lapses and Inadvertencies are infinitely preferable to the Works of an inferior Kind of Author which are scrupulously exact and conformable to all the Rules of correct Writing  I shall conclude my Paper with a Story out of  Boccalini  which sufficiently shews us the Opinion that judicious Author entertained of the Sort of Criticks I have been here mentioning A famous Critick says he having gathered together all the Faults of an eminent Poet made a Present of them to  Apollo  who received them very graciously and resolved to make the Author a suitable Return for the Trouble he had been at in collecting them In Order to this he set before him a Sack of Wheat as it had been just threshed out of the Sheaf He then bid him pick out the Chaff from among the Corn and lay it aside by itself The Critick applied himself to the Task with great Industry and Pleasure and after having made the due Separation was presented by  Apollo  with the Chaff for his Pains  SPECTATOR N  o    velut si  Egregio inspersos reprendas corpore naevos  Hor  AFTER what I have said in my last  Saturday  's Paper I shall enter on the Subject of this without farther Preface and remark the several Defects which  appear in the Fable the Characters the Sentiments and the Language of  Milton  's  Paradise Lost  not doubting but the Reader will pardon me if I alledge at the same Time whatever may be said for the Extenuation of such Defects The first Imperfection which I shall observe in the Fable is that the Event of it is unhappy  THE Fable of every Poem is according to  Aritatle  's Division either  Simple  or  Implex  It is called Simple when there is no Change of Fortune in it Implex when the Fortune of the chief Actor changes from Bad to Good or from Good to Bad The Implex Fable is thought the most perfect I suppose because it is more proper to stir up the Passions of the Reader and to surprize him with a greater Variety of Accidents  THE Implex Fable is therefore of two Kinds In the first the chief Actor makes his Way through a long Series of Dangers and Difficulties 'till he arrives at Honour and Prosperity as we see in the Story of  Ʋlisses  In the second the chief Actor in the Poem falls from some eminent Pitch of Honour and Prosperity into Misery and Disgrace Thus we see  Adam  and  Eve  sinking from a State of Innocence and Happiness into the most abject Condition of Sin and Sorrow  THE most taking Tragedies among the Antients were built on this last Sort of Implex Fable particularly the Tragedy of  OEdipus  which proceeds upon a Story if we may believe  Aristotle  the most proper for Tragedy that could be invented by the Wit of Man I have taken some Pains in a former Paper to shew that this Kind of Implex Fable wherein the Event is unhappy is more apt to affect an Audience than that of the first Kind notwithstanding many excellent Pieces among the Antients as well as most of those which have been written of late Years in our own Country are raised upon  contrary Plans I must however own that I think this Kind of Fable which is the most perfect in Tragedy is not so proper for an Heroick Poem  MILTON  seems to have been sensible of this Imperfection in his Fable and has therefore endeavoured to cure it by several Expedients particularly by the Mortification which the great Adversary of Mankind meets with upon his Return to the Assembly of Infernal Spirits as it is described in a beautiful Passage of the tenth Book and likewise by the Vision wherein  Adam  at the Close of the Poem sees his Offspring triumphing over his great Enemy and himself restored to a happier  Paradise  than that from which he fell  THERE is another Objection against  Milton  's Fable which is indeed almost the same with the former tho' placed in a different Light namely That the Hero in the  Paradise Lost  is unsuccessful and by no Means a Match for his Enemies This gave Occasion to Mr  Dryden  's Reflection that the Devil was in reality  Milton  's Hero I think I have obviated this Objection in my first Paper The  Paradise Lost  is an Epic or a Narrative Poem and he that looks for an Hero in it searches for that which  Milton  never intended but if he will needs fix the Name of an Hero upon any Person in it 'tis certainly the  Messiah  who is the Hero both in the Principal Action and in the chief Episodes Paganism could not furnish out a real Action for a Fable greater than that of the  Iliad  or  Aeneid  and therefore an Heathen could not form a higher Notion of a Poem than one of that Kind which they call an Heroic Whether  Milton  's is not of a sublimer Nature I will not presume to determine It is sufficient that I shew there is in the  Paradise Lost  all the Greatness of Plan Regularity of Design and masterly Beauties which we discover in  Homer  and  Virgil  I must in the next Place observe that  Milton  has interwoven in the Texture of his Fable some Particulars which do not seem to have Probability enough for an Epic Poem particularly in the Actions which he ascribes to  Sin  and  Death  and the Picture which he draws of the  Limbo of Vanity  with other Passages in the second Book Such Allegories rather savour of the Spirit of  Spenser  and  Ariosto  than of  Homer  and  Virgil  IN the Structure of his Poem he has likewise admitted of too many Digressions It is finely observed by  Aristotle  that the Author of an Heroic Poem should seldom speak himself but throw as much of his Work as he can into the Mouths of those who are his principal Actors  Aristotle  has given no Reason for this Precept but I presume it is because the Mind of the Reader is more awed and elevated when he hears  Aeneas  or  Achilles  speak than when  Virgil  or  Homer  talk in their own Persons Besides that assuming the Character of an eminent Man is apt to fire the Imagination and raise the Ideas of the Author  Tully  tells us mentioning his Dialogue of old Age in which  Cato  is the chief Speaker that upon a Review of it he was agreeably imposed upon and fancied that it was  Cato  and not he himself who uttered his Thoughts on that Subject  IF the Reader would be at the Pains to see how the Story of the  Iliad  and  Aeneid  is delivered by those Persons who act in it he will be surprised to find how little in either of these Poems proceeds from the Authors  Milton  has in the general Disposition of his Fable very finely observed this great Rule insomuch that there is scarce a third Part of it which comes from the Poet the rest is spoken either by  Adam  and  Eve  or by some Good or Evil Spirit who is engaged either in their Destruction or Defence  FROM what has been here observed it appears that Digressions are by no Means to be allowed of in an Epic Poem If the Poet even in the ordinary Course of his Narration should speak as little as possible he should certainly never let his Narration sleep for the sake of any Reflections of his own I have often observed with a secret Admiration that the longest Reflection in the  Aeneid  is in that Passage of the Tenth Book where  Turnus  is represented as dressing himself in the Spoils of  Pallas  whom he had slain  Virgil  here lets his Fable stand still for the Sake of the following Remark  How is the Mind of Man ignorant of Futurity and unable to bear prosperous Fortune with Moderation The Time will come when  Turnus  shall wish that he had left the Body of  Pallas  untouched and curse the Day on which he dressed himself in these Spoils  As the great Event of the  Aeneid  and the Death of  Turnus  whom  Aeneas  slew because he saw him adorned with the Spoils of  Pallas  turns upon this Incident  Virgil  went out of his Way to make this Reflection upon it without which so small a Circumstance might possibly have slipped out of his Reader's Memory  Lucan  who was an Injudicious Poet lets drop his Story very frequently for the Sake of his unnecessary Digressions or his  Diverticula  as  Scaliger  calls them If he gives us an Account of the Prodigies which preceded the Civil War he declaims upon the Occasion and shews how much happier it would be for Man if he did not feel his evil Fortune before it comes to pass and suffer not only by its real Weight but by the Apprehension of it  Milton  's Complaint for his Blindness his Panegyrick on Marriage his Reflections on  Adam  and  Eve  's going naked of the Angels eating and several other Passages in his Poem are liable to the same Exception tho' I must  confess there is so great a Beauty in these very Digressions that I would not with them our of his Poem  I have in a former Paper spoken of the  Characters  of  Milton  's  Paradise Lost  and declared my Opinion as to the Allegorical Persons who are introduced in it  IF we look into the  Sentiments  I think they are sometimes defective under the following Heads First as there are several of them too much pointed and some that degenerate even into Punns Of this last Kind I am afraid is that in the First Book where speaking of the Pigmies he calls them  The small  Infantry  Warr'd on by Cranes  ANOTHER Blemish that appears in some of his Thoughts is his frequent Allusion to Heathen Fables which are not certainly of a Piece with the Divine Subject of which he treats I do not find Fault with these Allusions where the Poet himself represents them as fabulous as he does in some Places but where he mentions them as Truths and Matters of Fact The Limits of my Paper will not give me Leave to be particular in Instances of this Kind The Reader will easily remark them in his Perusal of the Poem  A Third Fault in his Sentiments is an unnecessary Ostentation of Learning which likewise occurs very frequently It is certain that both  Homer  and  Virgil  were Masters of all the Learning of their Times but it shews itself in their Works after an indirect and concealed Manner  Milton  seems ambitions of letting us know by his Excursions on FreeWill and Predestination and his many Glances upon History Astronomy Geography and the like  as well as by the Terms and Phrases he sometimes makes Use of that he was acquainted with the whole Circle of Arts and Sciences  IF in the last Place we consider the  Language  of this great Poet we must allow what I have hinted in a former Paper that it is often too much laboured and sometimes obscured by old Words Transpositions and Foreign Idioms  Seneca  's Objection to the Stile of a great Author  Rigot ojus oratio nihil in ea placidum nihil lene  is what many Criticks make to  Milton  As I cannot wholly refute it so I have already apologized for it in another Paper to which I may further add that  Milton  's Sentiments and Ideas were so wonderfully sublime that it would have been impossible for him to have represented them in their full Strength and Beauty without having Recourse to these Foreign Assistances Our Language sunk under him and was unequal to that Greatness of Soul which furnished him with such glorious Conceptions  A second Fault in his Language is that he often affects a Kind of Jingle in his Words as in the following Passages and many others  And brought into the  World  a  World of  Woe  Begirt th' Almighty Throne  Beseeching  or  besieging    This  tempted  our  Attempt    At one slight  Bound  high overleapt all  Bound  I know there are Figures for this Kind of Speech that some of the greatest Antients have been guilty of it and that  Aristotle  himself has given it a Place in his Rhetorick among the Beauties of that Art But as it is in itself poor and trifling it is I think at present universally exploded by all the Masters of polite Writing  THE last Fault which I shall take Notice of in  Milton  's Stile is the frequent Use of what the Learned call  Technical Words  or Terms of Art It is one of the great Beauties of Poetry to make hard Things intelligible and to deliver what is abstruse of it self in such easy Language as may be understood by ordinary Readers Besides that the Knowledge of a Poet should rather seem born with him or inspired than drawn from Books and Systems I have often wondered how Mr  Dryden  could translate a Passage out of  Virgil  after the following Manner  Tack to the Larboard and stand off to Sea  Veer Starboard Sea and Land  Milton  makes Use of  Larboard  in the same Manner When he is upon Building he mentions  Doric Pillars Pilasters Cornice Freeze Architrave  When he talks of Heavenly Bodies you meet with  Ecliptic  and  Eccentric  the  Trepidation Stars dropping from the Zenith Rays culminating from the Equator  To which might be added many Instances of the like Kind in several other Arts and Sciences  Ishall in my next Papers give an Account of the many particular Beauties in  Milton  which would have been too long to insert under those general Heads I have already treated of and with which I intend to conclude this Piece of Criticism  SPECTATOR N  o    volet haec sub luce videri  Judicis argutum quae non formidat acumen  Hor  I Have seen in the Works of a modern Philosopher a Map of the Spots in the Sun My last Paper of the Faults and Blemishes in  Milton  's  Paradise Lost  may be considered as a Piece of the same Nature To pursue the Allusion As it is observed that among the bright Parts of the luminous Body abovementioned there are some which glow more intensely and dart a stronger Light than others so notwithstanding I have already shewn  Milton  's Poem to be very beautiful in general I shall now proceed to take Notice of such Beauties as appear to me more exquisite than the rest  Milton  has proposed the Subject of his Poem in the following Verses  Of Mans first disobedience and the fruit  Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste  Brought Death into the world and all our woe  With loss of  Eden  'till one greater Man  Restore us and regain the blissful Seat  Sing Heav'nly Muse  THESE Lines are perhaps as plain simple and unadorned as any of the whole Poem in which Particular the Author has conform'd himself to the Example of  Homer  and the Precept of  Horace  HIS Invocation to a Work which turns in a great Measure upon the Creation of the World is very  properly made to the Muse who inspired  Moses  in those Books from whence our Author drew his Subject and to the Holy Spirit who is therein represented as operating after a particular Manner in the first Production of Nature This whole Exordium rises very happily into noble Language and Sentiment as I think the Transition to the Fable is exquisitely beautiful and natural  THE Ninedays Astonishment in which the Angels lay entranced after their dreadful Overthrow and Fall from Heaven before they could recover either the Use of Thought or Speech is a noble  Circumstance  and very finely imagined  Vid Hesiod  The Division of Hell into Seas of Fire and into firm Ground impregnated with the same furious Element with that particular Circumstance of the Exclusion of  Hope  from those infernal Regions are Instances of the same great and fruitful Invention  THE Thoughts in the first Speech and Description of  Satan  who is one of the principal Actors in this Poem are wonderfully proper to give us a full Idea of him His Pride Envy and Revenge Obstinacy Despair and Impenitence are all of them very artfully interwoven In short his first Speech is a Complication of all those Passions which discover themselves separately in several other of his Speeches in the Poem The whole Part of this great Enemy of Mankind is filled with such Incidents as are very apt to raise and terrify the Reader's Imagination Of this Nature in the Book now before us is his being the first that awakens out of the general Trance with his Posture on the burning Lake his rising from it and the Description of his Shield and Spear  Thus  Satan  talking to his nearest mate  With head uplife above the wave and eyes  That sparkling blazed his other parts beside  Prone on the Flood extended long and large  Lay floating many a rood  Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool  His mighty Stature on each hand the flames  Driv'n backward slope their pointing Spires and rowl'd  In Billows leave i'th' midst a horrid vale  Then with expanded Wings he steers his flight  Alost incumbent on the dusky Air  That felt unusual weight  His pondrous Shield  Ethereal temper massie large and round  Behind him cast the broad Circumference  Hung on his Shoulders like the Moon whose orb  Thro' Optick Glass tho  Tuscan  Artists view  At Ev'ning from the top of  Fesole  Or in  Valdatno  to desory new Lands  Rivers or Mountains on her spotty Globe  His Spear to equal which the tallest pine  Hewn on  Norwegian  Hills to be the Mast  Of some great Ammiral were but a wand  He walk'd with to support uneasy Steps  Over the burning Marl  TO which we may add his Call to the fallen Angels that lay plunged and stupified in the Sea of Fire  He call'd so loud that all the hollow deep  Of Hell resounded  BUT there is no single Passage in the whole Poem worked up to a greater Sublimity than that wherein his Person is described in those celebrated Lines  He above the rest  In Shape and Gesture proudly eminent  Stood like a Tower  c  HIS Sentiments are every way answerable to his Character and suitable to a created Being of the most exalted and most depraved Nature Such is that in which he takes Possession of his Place of Torments  Hail Horrors hail  Infernal World and thou profoundest Hill  Receive thy new Possessor one who brings  A Mind not to be changed by place or time  And afterwards  Here at leest  We shall be free th' Almighty hath not built  Here for his envy will not drive us hence  Here we may reign secure and in my choice  To reign is worth ambition tho' in Hell  Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven  AMIDST those Impieties which this Enraged Spirit utters in other Places of the Poem the Author has taken Care to introduce none that is not big with Absurdity and incapable of shocking a Religious Reader his Words as the Poet describes them bearing only a  Semblance of Worth not Substance  He is likewise with great Art described as owning his Adversary to be Almighty Whatever perverse Interpetation he puts on the Justice Mercy and other Attributes of the Supreme Being he frequently confesses his Omnipotence that being the Perfection he was forced to allow him and the only Consideration which could support his Pride under the Shame of his Defeat  NOR must I here omit that beautiful Circumstance of his bursting out in Tears upon his Survey of those innumerable Spirits whom he had involved in the same Guilt and Ruin with himself  He now prepared  To speak whereat their doubled Ranks they bend  From Wing to Wing and half enclose him round  With all his Peers Attention held them mute  Thrice he assay'd and thrice in spite of Scorn  Tears such as Angels weep burst forth  THE Catalogue of Evil Spirits has Abundance of Learning in it and a very agreeable Turn of Poetry which rises in a great measure from its describing the Places where they were worshipped by those beautiful Marks of Rivers so frequent among the Antient Poets The Author had doubtless in this Place  Homer  's Catalogue of Ships and  Virgil  's Lift of Warriors in his view The Characters of  Moloch  and  Belial  prepare the Reader's Mind for their respective Speeches and Behaviour in the second and sixth Book The Account of  Thammuz  is finely Romantick and suitable to what we read among the Antients of the Worship which was paid to that Idol    Thammuz  came next behind  Whose annual Wound in  Lebanon  allur'd  The  Syrian  Damsels to lament his fate  In am'rous Ditties all a Summer's day  While smooth  Adonis  from his native Rock  Ran purple to the Sea suppos'd with Blood  Of  Thammuz  yearly wounded the Lovetale  Infected  Sion  's Daughters with like Heat  Whose wanton Passions in the sacred Porch  Ezekiel  saw when by the Vision led  His Eye survey'd the dark Idolatries  Of alienated  Judah    The Reader will pardon me if I insert as a Note on this beautiful Passage the Account given us by the late ingenious Mr  Maundrell  of this Antient  Piece of Worship and probably the first Occasion of such a Superstition  'We came to a fair large Riverdoubtless the Antient River  Adonis  so famous for the Idolatrous Rites perform'd here in Lamentation of  Adonis  We had the Fortune to see what may be supposed to be the Occasion of that Opinion which  Lucian  relates concerning this River  viz  That this Stream at certain Seasons of the Year especially about the Feast of  Adonis  is of a bloody Colour which the Heathens looked upon as proceeding from a kind of Sympathy in the River for the Death of  Adonis  who was killed by a wild Boar in the Mountains out of which this Stream rises Something like this we saw actually come to pass for the Water was stain'd to a surprising redness and as we observ'd in Travelling had discolour'd the Sea a great way into a reddish Hue occasion'd doubtless by a sort of Minium or red Earth washed into the River by the violence of the Rain and not by any stain from  Adonis  's Blood'  THE Passage in the Catalogue explaining the manner how Spirits transform themselves by Contraction or Enlargement of their Dimensions is introduced with great Judgment to make way for several surprising Accidents in the Sequel of the Poem There follows one at the very End of the First Book which is what the  French  Criticks call  Marvellous  but at the same Time  probable  by reason of the Passage last mentioned As soon as the Infernal Palace is finished we are told the Multitude and Rabble of Spirits immediately shrunk themselves into a small Compass that there might be Room for such a numberless Assembly in this capacious Hall But it is the Poet's Refinement upon this Thought which I most admire and which is indeed very noble in its self For he tells us that notwithstanding the vulgar among the fallen Spirits  contracted their Forms those of the first Rank and Dignity still preserved their natural Dimensions  Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest Forms  Reduc'd their Shapes immense and were at large  Though without Number still amidst the Hall  Of that infernal Court But far within  And in their own Dimensions like themselves  The Great Seraphick Lords and Cherubim  In close recess and secret conclave sate  A thousand DemyGods on Golden Seats  Frequent and full  THE Character of  Mammon  and the Description of the  Pandamonium  are full of Beauties  THERE are several other Strokes in the First Book wonderfully poetical and Instances of that Sublime Genius so peculiar to the Author Such is the Description of  Azazel  's Stature and of the Infernal Standard which he unfurls as also of that ghastly Light by which the Fiends appear to one another in their Place of Torments  The Seat of Dosolation void of Light  Save what the glimm'ring of those livid Flames  Casts pale and dreadful  THE Shout of the whole Host of fallen Angels when drawn up in Battel Array  The Ʋniversal Host up sent  A Shout that tore Hell's Concave and beyond  Frighted the Reign of  Chaos  and old  Night  THE Review which the Leader makes of his Infernal Army  He thro' the armed files  Darts his experienc'd Eye and soon traverse  The whole Battalion views their order due  Their Visages and Stature as of Gods  Their number last he sums and now his Heart  Distends with Pride and hard'ning in his Strength  Glories  THE Flash of Light which appeared upon the drawing of their Swords  He spake and to confirm his Words outflew  Millions of flaming Swords drawn from the Thighs  Of mighty  Cherubim  the sudden Blaze  Far round illumin'd Hell  THE sudden Production of the  Pandaemoniune  Anon out of the Earth a Fabrick huge  Rose like an Exhalation with the Sound  Of dulcet Symphonies and Voices sweet  THE artificial Illuminations made in it  From the arched Roof  Pendent by subtle Magick many a Row  Of Starry Lamps and blazing Crescets fed  With  Naphtha  and  Asphaltus  yielded Light  As from a Sky  THERE are also several noble Similies and Allusions in the first Book of  Paradise Lost  And here I must observe that when  Milton  alludes either to Things or Persons he never quits his Simile till it rises to some very great Idea which is often foreign to the Occasion that gave Birth to it The Resemblance does not perhaps last above a Line or two but the Poet runs on with the Hint till he  has raised out of it some glorious Image or Sentiment proper to inflame the Mind of the Reader and to give it that sublime Kind of Entertainment which is suitable to the Nature of an Heroic Poem Those who are acquainted with  Homer  's and  Virgil  's Way of Writing cannot but be pleased with this Kind of Structure in  Milton  's Similitudes I am the more particular on this Head because ignorant Readers who have formed their Taste upon the quaint Similies and little Turns of Wit which are so much in Vogue among modern Poets cannot relish these Beauties which are of a much higher Nature and are therefore apt to censure  Milton  's Comparisons in which they do not see any surprising Points of Likeness Monsieur  Perrault  was a Man of this vitiated Relish and for that very Reason has endeavoured to turn into Ridicule several of  Homer  's Similitudes which he calls  Comparaisons a longue queue Longtail'd Comparisons  I shall conclude this Paper on the First Book of  Milton  with the Answer which Monsieur  Boileau  makes to  Perrault  on this Occasion  'Comparisons says he in Odes and Epic Poems are not introduced only to illustrate and embellish the Discourse but to amuse and relax the Mind of the reader by frequently disengaging him from too painful an Attention to the principal Subject and by leading him into other agreeable Images  Homer  says he excelled in this Particular whose Comparisons abound with such Images of Nature as are proper to relieve and diversifie his Subjects He continually instructs the Reader and makes him take notice even in Objects which are every Day before our Eyes of such Circumstances as we should not otherwise have observed  To this he adds as a Maxim universally acknowledged  that it is not necessary in Poetry for the Points of the Comparison to correspond with one another exactly but  that a general Resemblance is sufficient and that too much Nicety in this Particular savours of the Rhetorician and Epigrammatist'  IN short if we look into the Conduct of  Homer Virgil  and  Milton  as the great Fable is the Soul of each Poem so to give their Works an agreeable Variety their Episodes are so many short Fables and their Similes so many short Episodes to which you may add if you please that their Metaphors are so many short Similes If the Reader considers the Comparisons in the first Book of  Milton  of the Sun in an Eclipse of the fleeping  Leviathan  of the Bees swarming about their Hive of the fairy Dance in the View wherein I have here placed them he will easily discover the great Beauties that are in each of those Passages  SPECTATOR N  o    Di quibus imperium est animarum umbraeque silentes  Et Chaos et Phlegethon loca nocte silentia late  Sit mihi fas audite loqui fit numine vestro  Pandere res alta terra et caligine mersas  Virg  I Have before observed in general that the Persons whom  Milton  introduces into his Poem always discover such Sentiments and Behaviour as are in a peculiar Manner conformable to their respective Characters Every Circumstance in their Speeches and Actions is with great Justness and Delicacy adapted to the Persons who speak and act As the Poet very much excels in this Consistency of his Characters I shall beg Leave to consider several  Passages of the Second Book in this Light That superior Greatness and MockMajesty which is ascribed to the Prince of the fallen Angels is admirably preserved in the Beginning of this Book His opening and closing the Debate his taking on himself that great Enterprize at the Thought of which the whole infernal Assembly trembled his encountring the hideous Phantom who guarded the Gates of Hell and appeared to him in all his Terrors are Instances of that proud and daring Mind which could not brook Submission even to Omnipotence  SATAN was now at Hand and from his Seat  The Monster moving onward came as fast  With horrid Strides Hell trembled as he strode  Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd  Admir'd not fear'd  THE same Boldness and Intrepidity of Behaviour discovers it self in the several Adventures which he meets with during his Passage through the Regions of unformed Matter and particularly in his Address to those tremendous Powers who are described as presiding over it  THE Part of  Moloch  is likewise in all its Circumstances full of that Fire and Fury which distinguish this Spirit from the rest of the fallen Angels He is described in the first Book as besmeared with the Blood of humane Sacrifices and delighted with the Tears of Parents and the Cries of Children In the second Book he is marked out as the fiercest Spirit that fought in Heaven and if we consider the Figure which he makes in the sixth Book where the Battel of the Angels is described we find it every Way answerable to the same furious enraged Character  Where the might of  Gabriel  fought  And with fierce Ensigns pierc'd the deep array  Of  Molec  furious King who him defy'd  And at his Chariot wheels to drag him bound  Threaten'd nor from the holy one of Heav'n  Refrain'd his Tongue blasphemous but anon  Down cloven to the waste with shatter'd arms  And uncouth pain fle'd bellowing  IT may be worth while to observe that  Milton  has represented this violent impetuous Spirit who is hurried on by such precipitate Passions as the  first  that rises in that Assembly to give his Opinion upon their present Posture of Affairs Accordingly he declares himself abruptly for War and appears incensed at his Companions for losing so much Time as even to deliberate upon it All his Sentiments are rash audacious and desperate Such is that of arming themselves with their Tortures and turning their Punishments upon him who inflicted them  No let us rather chuse  Arm'd with Hellflames and fury all at once  O'er Heav'ns high tow'rs to force resistless Way  Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms  Against the Tort'rer when to meet the Noise  Of his almighty Engine he shall hear  Infernal Thunder and for Lightning see  Black fire and horror shot with equal Rage  Among his Angels and his Throne it self  Mixt with  Tartarean  Sulphur and strange Fire  His own invented Torments  HIS preferring Annihilation to Shame or Misery is also highly suitable to his Character as the Comfort he draws from their disturbing the Peace of Heaven that if it be not Victory it is Revenge is a Sentiment truly diabolical and becoming the Bitterness of this implacable Spirit  BELIAL  is described in the first Book as the Idol of the lewd and luxurious He is in the second Book pursuant to that Description characterised as timorous and slothful and if we look into the sixth Book we find him celebrated in the Battel of Angels for Nothing but that Scoffing Speech which he makes to  Satan  on their supposed Advantage over the Enemy As his Appearance is uniform and of a piece in these three several Views we find his Sentiments in the infernal Assembly every Way conformable to his Character Such are his Apprehensions of a second Battel his Horrors of Annihilation his preferring to be miserable rather than  not to be  I need not observe that the Contrast of Thought in this Speech and that which precedes it gives an agreeable Variety to the Debate  MAMMON  's Character is so fully drawn in the first Book that the Poet adds Nothing to it in the Second We were before told that he was the first who taught Mankind to ransack the Earth for Gold and Silver and that he was the Architect of  Pandaemonium  or the infernal Palace where the evil Spirits were to meet in Council His Speech in this Book is every where suitable to so depraved a Character How proper is that Reflection of their being unable to taste the Happiness of Heaven were they actually there in the Mouth of one who while he was in Heaven is said to have had his Mind dazled with the outward Pomps and Glories of the Place and to have been more intent on the Riches of the Pavement than on the beatifick Vision I shall also leave the Reader to judge how agreeable the following Sentiments are to the same Character  This deep World  Of Darkness do we dread How oft amidst  Thick Cloud and dark doth Heav'ns allruling Size  Chuse to reside his Glory unobscured  And with the Majesty of Darkness round  Covers his Throne from whence deep Thunders rear  Mustring their Rage and Heav'n resembles Hell  As he our Darkness cannot we his Light  Imitate when we please This Desart Soil  Wants not her hidden Lustre Gems and Gold  Nor want we Skill or Art from whence to raise  Magnificence and what can Heav'n shew more  BEELZEBƲB  who is reckon'd the second in Dignity that fell and is in the first Book the second that awakens out of the Trance and confers with  Satan  upon the Situation of their Affairs maintains his Rank in the Book now before us There is a wonderful Majesty described in his rising up to speak He acts as a Kind of Moderator between the two opposite Parties and proposes a third Undertaking which the whole Assembly gives into The Motion he makes of detaching one of their Body in Search of a new World is grounded upon a Project devised by  Satan  and cursorily proposed by him in the following Lines of the first Book  Space may produce new Worlds whereof so rise  There went a Fame in Heav'n that he e'er long  Intended to create and therein plant  A Generation whom his choice regard  Should favour equal to the Sons of Heav'n  Thither if but to pry shall be perhaps  Our first Eruption thither or elsewhere  For this infernal Pit shall never hold  Celestial Spirits in bondage nor th' Abyss  Long under Darkness cover But these Thoughts  Full Counsel must mature  IT is on this Project that  Beelzebub  grounds his Proposal  What if we find  Some easier Enterprize There is a Place  If ancient and prophetic Fame in Heav'n  Err not another World the happy Seat  Of some new Race call'd  MAN  about this Time  To be created like to us though less  In Power and Excellence but favour'd more  Of him who rules above so was his Will  Pronounc'd among the Gods and by an Oath  That shook Heav'ns whole Circumference confirm'd  THE Reader may observe how just it was not to omit in the first Book the Project upon which the whole Poem turns As also that the Prince of the fall'n Angels was the only proper Person to give it Birth and that he next to him in Dignity was the fittest to second and support it  THERE is besides I think something wonderfully beautiful and very apt to affect the Reader's Imagination in this antient Prophecy or Report in Heaven concerning the Creation of Man Nothing could shew more the Dignity of the Species than this Tradition which ran of them before their Existence They are represented to have been the Talk of Heaven before they were created  Virgil  in compliment to the  Roman  Commonwealth makes the Heroes of it appear in their State of Preexistence but  Milton  does a far greater Honour to Mankind in general as he gives us a Glimpse of them even before they are in Being  THE rising of this great Assembly is described in a very sublime and poetical Manner  Their rising all at once was as the sound  Of Thunder heard remote  THE Diversions of the fallen Angels with the particular Account of their Place of Habitation are  described with great Pregnancy of Thought and Copiousness of Invention The Diversions are every way suitable to Beings who had Nothing left them but Strength and Knowledge misapplied Such are their Contentions at the Race and in Feats of Arms with their Entertainment in the following Lines  Others with vast  Typhaean  Rage more fell  Rend up both Rocks and Hills and ride the Air  In Whirlwind Hell scarce holds the wild uproar  THEIR Musick is employed in celebrating their own criminal Exploits and their Discourse in sounding the unfathomable Depths of Fate Freewill and Foreknowledge  THE several Circumstances in the Description of Hell are finely imagined as the four Rivers which disgorge themselves into the Sea of Fire the Extreams of Cold and Heat and the River of Oblivion The monstrous Animals produced in that infernal World are represented by a single Line which gives us a more horrid Idea of them than a much longer Description would have done  Nature breeds  Perverse all monstrous all prodigious Things  Abominable inutterable and  worse  Than Fables yet have feign'd or fear conceiv'd  Gorgons and Hydra's and Chimera's dire  THIS Episode of the fallen Spirits and their Place of Habitation comes in very happily to unbend the Mind of the Reader from its Attention to the Debate An ordinary Poet would indeed have spun out so many Circumstances to a great Length and by that Means have weakned instead of illustrated the principal Fable  THE Flight of Satan to the Gates of Hell is finely imaged  I have already declared my Opinion of the Allegory concerning  Sin  and  Death  which is however a very finished Piece in its Kind when it is not considered as a Part of an Epic Poem The Genealogy of the several Persons is contrived with great Delicacy  Sin  is the Daughter of  Satan  and  Death  the Offspring of  Sin  The incestuous Mixture between  Sin  and  Death  produces those Monsters and Hellhounds which from Time to Time enter into their Mother and tear the Bowels of her who gave them Birth These are the Terrors of an evil Conscience and the proper Fruits of  Sin  which naturally rise from the Apprehensions of  Death  This last beautiful Moral is I think clearly intimated in the Speech of  Sin  where complaining of this her dreadful Issue she adds  Before mine Eyes in Opposition sits  Grim  Death  thy Son and Foe who sets them on  And me his Parent would full soon devour  For want of other Prey but that he knows  His End with mine involv'd  I need not mention to the Reader the beautiful Circumstance in the last Part of this Quotation He will likewise observe how naturally the three Persons concerned in this Allegory are tempted by one common Interest to enter into a Confederacy together and how properly  Sin  is made the Portress of Hell and the only Being that can open the Gates to that World of Tortures  THE descriptive Part of this Allegory is likewise very strong and full of sublime Ideas The Figure of  Death  the Regal Crown upon his Head his Menace of  Satan  his advancing to the Combat the Outcry at his Birth are Circumstances too noble  to be past over in Silence and extreamly suitable to this  King of Terrors  I need not Mention the Justness of Thought which is observed in the Generation of these several Symbolical Persons that  Sin  was produced upon the first Revolt of  Satan  that  Death  appeared soon after he was cast into Hell and that the Terrors of Conscience were conceived at the Gate of this Place of Torments The Description of the Gates is very poetical as the opening of them is full of  Milton  's Spirit  ON a sudden open fly  With impetuous recoil and jarring sound  Th' infernal Doors and on their Hinges grate  Harsh Thunder that the lowest bottom shook  Of  Erebus  She open'd but to shut  Excell'd her Power the Gates wide open stood  That with extended Wings a banner'd Host  Ʋnder spread Ensigns marching might pass through  With Horse and Chariots rank'd in loose array  So wide they stood and like a Furnace Mouth  Cast forth redounding Smoak and ruddy Flame  IN Satan's Voyage through the Chaos there are several imaginary Persons described as residing in that immense Waste of Matter This may perhaps be conformable to the Taste of those Criticks who are pleased with Nothing in a Poet which has not Life and Manners ascribed to it but for my own Part I am pleased most with those Passages in this Description which carry in them a greater Measure of Probability and are such as might possibly have happened Of this Kind is his first Mounting in the Smoak that rises from the infernal Pit his falling into a Cloud of Nitre and the like combustible Materials that by their Explosion still hurried him forward in his Voyage his springing upward like a Pyramid of Fire with his laborious  Passage through that Confusion of Elements which the Poet calls  The Womb of Nature and perhaps her Grave  THE Glimmering Light which shot into the  Chaos  from the utmost Verge of the Creation with the distant Discovery of the Earth that hung close by the Moon are wonderfully beautiful and poetical  SPECTATOR N  o    Nec dcus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus  Inciderit  Hor  HORACE  advises a Poet to consider thoroughly the Nature and Force of his Genius  Milton  seems to have known perfectly well wherein his Strength lay and has therefore chosen a Subject entirely conformable to those Talents of which he was Master As his Genius was wonderfully turned to the Sublime his Subject is the noblest that could have entered into the Thoughts of Man Every Thing that is truly great and astonishing has a Place in it The whole Systeme of the intellectual World the  Chaos  and the Creation Heaven Earth and Hell enter into the Constitution of his Poem  HAVING in the First and Second Book represented the Infernal World with all its Horrours the Thread of his Fable naturally leads him into the opposite Regions of Bliss and Glory  IF  Milton  's Majesty forsakes him any where it is in those Parts of his Poem where the Divine Persons are introduced as Speakers One may I think observe that the Author proceeds with a Kind of Fear and Trembling whilst he describes the Sentiments of the Almighty He dares not give his Imagination its full Play but chuses to confine himself to such Thoughts as are drawn from the Books of the most Orthodox Divines and to such Expressions as may be met with in Scripture The Beauties therefore which we are to look for in these Speeches are not of a poetical Nature nor so proper to fill the Mind with Sentiments of Grandeur as with Thoughts of Devotion The Passions which they are designed to raise are a Divine Love and Religious Fear The particular Beauty of the Speeches in the Third Book consists in that Shortness and Perspicuity of Stile in which the Poet has couched the greatest Mysteries of Christianity and drawn together in a regular Scheme the whole Dispensation of Providence with respect to Man He has represented all the abstruse Doctrines of Predestination FreeWill and Grace as also the great Points of Incarnation and Redemption which naturally grow up in a Poem that treats of the Fall of Man with great Energy of Expression and in a clearer and stronger Light than I ever met with in any other Writer As these Points are dry in themselves to the Generality of Readers the concise and clear Manner in which he has treated them is very much to be admired as is likewise that particular Art which he has made use of in the interspersing of all those Graces of Poetry which the Subject was capable of receiving  THE Survey of the whole Creation and of every Thing that is transacted in it is a Prospect worthy of Omniscience and as much above that in which  Virgil  has drawn his  Jupiter  as the Christian  Idea of the Supream Being is more Rational and Sublime than that of the Heathens The particular Objects on which he is described to have cast his Eye are represented in the most beautiful and lively Manner  Now had th' Almighty Father from above  From the pure Empyrean where he sits  High thron'd above all height bent down his Eye  His own Works and their Works at once to View  About him all the Sanctities of Heav'n  Stood thick as Stars and from his Sight receiv'd  Beatitude past utterance On his Right  The radiant Image of his Glory sat  His only Son On Earth he first beheld  Our two first Parents yet the only two  Of Mankind in the happy Garden plac'd  Reaping immortal fruits of Joy and Love  Ʋninterrupted Joy unrival'd Love  In blisful Solitude he then survey'd  Hell and the Gulf between and  Satan  there  Coasting the Wall of Heav'n on this Side Night  In the dun air sublime and ready now  To stoop with wearied Wings and willing Feet  On the bare outside of this World that seem'd  Firm Land imbosom'd without firmament  Ʋncertain which in Ocean or in Air  Him God beholding from his prospect high  Wherein past present future he beholds  Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake  SATAN  's Approach to the Confines of the Creation is finely imaged in the Beginning of the Speech which immediately follows The Effects of this Speech in the blessed Spirits and in the divine Person to whom it was addressed cannot but fill the Mind of the Reader with a secret Pleasure and Complacency  Thus while God spake ambrosial Fragrance fill'd  All Heav'n and in the blessed Spirits elect  Sense of new Joy ineffable diffus'd  Beyond compare the Son of God was seen  Most glorious in him all his Father shone  Substantially express'd and in his Face  Divine Compassion visibly appear'd  Love without End and without Measure Grace  I need not Point out the Beauty of that Circumstance wherein the whole Host of Angels are represented as standing mute nor show how proper the Occasion was to produce such a Silence in Heaven The Close of this Divine Colloquy with the Hymn of Angels that follows upon it are so wonderfully beautiful and poetical that I should not forbear inserting the whole Passage if the Bounds of my Paper would give me leave  No sooner had th' Almighty ceas'd but all  The multitudes of Angels with a shout  Loud as from Numbers without Number sweet  As from blest Voices utt'ring Joy Heav'n rung  With Jubilee and loud Hosanna's fill'd  Th' eternal Regions  c c    SATAN  's Walk upon the Outside of the Universe which at a Distance appeared to him of a Globular Form but upon his nearer Approach looked like an unbounded Plain is natural and noble As his Roaming upon the Frontiers of the Creation between that Mass of Matter which was wrought into a World and that shapeless unformed Heap of Materials which still lay in Chaos and Confusion strikes the Imagination with something astonishingly great and wild I have before spoken of the  Limbo of Vanity  which the Poet places upon this outermost Surface of the Universe and shall here explain  my self more at large on that and other Parts of the Poem which are of the same shadowy Nature  ARISTOTLE  observes that the Fable of an Epic Poem should abound in Circumstances that are both credible and astonishing or as the  French  Criticks chuse to phrase it the Fable should be filled with the Probable and the Marvellous This Rule is as fine and just as any in  Aristole  's whole Art of Poetry  IF the Fable is only probable it differs Nothing from a true History if it is only marvellous it is no better than a Romance The great Secret therefore of Heroick Poetry is to relate such Circumstances as may produce in the Reader at the same Time both Belief and Astonishment This is brought to pass in a  well chosen  Fable by the Account of such Things as have really happened or at least of such Things as have happened according to the received Opinions of Mankind  Milton  's Fable is a Masterpiece of this Nature as the War in Heaven the Condition of the fallen Angels the State of Innocence the Temptation of the Serpent and the Fall of Man though they are very astonishing in themselves are not only credible but actual Points of Faith  THE next Method of reconciling Miracles with Credibility is by a happy Invention of the Poet as in particular when he introduces Agents of a superior Nature who are capable of effecting what is wonderful and what is not to be met with in the ordinary Course of Things  Ʋlysses  's Ship being turn'd into a Rock and  Aeneas  's Fleet into a Shoal of Water Nymphs though they are very surprising Accidents are nevertheless probable when we are told that they were the Gods who thus transformed them It is this Kind of Machinery which fills the Poems both of  Homer  and  Virgil  with such Circumstances as are wonderful but not impossible and  so frequently produce in the Reader the most pleasing Passion that can rise in the Mind of Man which is Admiration If there be any Instance in the  Aeneid  liable to Exception upon this Account it is in the Beginning of the Third Book where  Aeneas  is represented as tearing up the Myrtle that dropped Blood To qualifie this wonderful Circumstance  Polydorus  tells a Story from the Root of the Myrtle that the barbarous Inhabitants of the Country having pierced him with Spears and Arrows the Wood which was left in his Body took Root in his Wounds and gave Birth to that bleeding Tree This Circumstance seems to have the Marvellous without the Probable because it is represented as proceeding from natural Causes without the Interposition of any God or rather supernatural Power capable of producing it The Spears and Arrows grow of themselves without so much as the modern Help of an Enchantment If we look into the Fiction of  Milton  's Fable though we find it full of surprising Incidents they are generally suited to our Notions of the Things and Persons described and tempered with a due Measure of Probability I must only make an Exception to the  Limbo of Vanity  with his Episode of  Sin  and  Death  and some of the imaginary Persons in his  Chaos  These Passages are astonishing but not credible the Reader cannot so far impose upon himself as to see a Possibility in them they are the Description of Dreams and Shadows not of Things or Persons I know that many Criticks look upon the Stories of  Circe Polyphemt  the  Sirens  nay the whole  Odissey  and  Iliad  to be Allegories but allowing this to be true they are Fables which considering the Opinions of Mankind that prevailed in the Age of the Poets might possibly have been according to the Letter The Persons are such as might have acted what is ascribed to them as the Circumstances in which they are  represented might possibly have been Truths and Realities This Appearance of Probability is so absolutely requisite in the greater Kinds of Poetry that  Aristotle  observes the ancient Tragick Writers made use of the Names of such great Men as had actually lived in the World tho' the Tragedy proceeded upon Adventures they were never engaged in on Purpose to make the Subject more credible In a Word besides the hidden Meaning of an Epic Allegory the plain literal Sense ought to appear probable The Story should be such as an ordinary Reader may acquiesce in whatever natural moral or political Truth may be discovered in it by Men of greater Penetration  SATAN  after having long wandred upon the Surface or outmost Wall of the Universe discovers at last a wide Gap in it which led into the Creation and is described as the Opening through which the Angels pass to and fro into the lower World upon their Errands to Mankind His Sitting upon the Brink of this Passage and taking a Survey of the whole Face of Nature that appeared to him new and fresh in all its Beauties with the Simile illustrating this Circumstance fills the Mind of the Reader with as surprising and glorious an Idea as any that arises in the whole Poem He looks down into that vast Hollow of the Universe with the Eye or as  Milton  calls it in his first Book with the Kenn of an Angel He surveys all the Wonders in this immense Amphitheatre that lye between both the Poles of Heaven and takes in at one View the whole Round of the Creation  HIS Flight between the several Worlds that shined on every Side of him with the particular Description of the Sun are set forth in all the Wantonness of a luxuriant Imagination His Shape Speech and Behaviour upon his transforming himself  into an Angel of Light are touched with exquisite Beauty The Poet's Thought of directing  Satan  to the Sun which in the Vulgar Opinion of Mankind is the most conspicuous Part of the Creation and the placing in it an Angel is a Circumstance very finely contrived and the more adjusted to a poetical Probability as it was a received Doctrine among the most famous Philosophers that every Orb had its  Intelligence  and as an Apostle in sacred Writ is said to have seen such an Angel in the Sun In the Answer which this Angel returns to the disguised Evil Spirit there is such a becoming Majesty as is altogether suitable to a superior Being The Part of it in which he represents himself as present at the Creation is very noble in it self and not only proper where it is introduced but requisite to prepare the Reader for what follows in the Seventh Book  I saw when at his Word the formless Mass  This World's Material Mould came to a Heap  Confusion heard his Voice and wild uproar  Stood rul'd stood vast infinitude confin'd  Till at his second bidding Darkness fled  Light shon  c  IN the following Part of the Speech he points out the Earth with such Circumstances that the Reader can scarce forbear fancying himself employed on the same distant View of it  Look downward on the Globe whose hither Side  With light from hence tho' but reflected shines  That Place is Earth the Seat of Man that light  His day  c  I must not conclude my Reflections upon this third Book of  Paradise Lost  without taking Notice  of that celebrated Complaint of  Milton  with which it opens and which certainly deserves all the Praises that have been given it tho' as I have before hinted it may rather be looked upon as an Excrescence than as an essential Part of the Poem The same Observation might be applied to that beautiful Digression upon Hypocrisie in the same Book  SPECTATOR N  o    Nec satis est pulchra esse poemata dulcia sunto  Hor  THOSE who know how many Volumes have been written on the Poems of  Homer  and  Virgil  will easily pardon the Length of my Discourse upon  Milton The Paradise Lost  is looked upon by the best Judges as the greatest Production or at least the noblest Work of Genius in our Language and therefore deserves to be set before an  English  Reader in its full Beauty For this Reason tho' I have endeavoured to give a general Idea of its Graces and Imperfections in my six first Papers I thought my self obliged to bestow one upon every Book in particular The Three first Books I have already dispatched and am now entring upon the Fourth I need not acquaint my Reader that there are Multitudes of Beauties in this great Author especially in the descriptive Parts of his Poem which I have not touched upon it being my Intention to point out those only which appear to me the most exquisite or those which are not so obvious to ordinary Readers Every one that has read the Criticks who have written upon  the  Odissy  the  Iliad  and the  Aeneid  knows very well that though they agree in their Opinions of the great Beauties in those Poems they have nevertheless each of them discovered several MasterStrokes which have escaped the Observation of the rest In the same Manner I question not but any Writer who shall treat on this Subject after me may find several Beauties in  Milton  which I have not taken notice of I must likewise observe that as the greatest Masters of critical Learning differ among one another as to some particular Points in an Epic Poem I have not bound my self scrupulously to the Rules which any one of them has laid down upon that Art but have taken the Liberty sometimes to join with one and sometimes with another and sometimes to differ from all of them when I have thought that the Reason of the Thing was on my Side  WE may consider the Beauties of the Fourth Book under three Heads In the first are those Pictures of StillLife which we meet with in the Descriptions of  Eden Paradise Adam  's Bower  c  In the next are the Machines which comprehend the Speeches and Behaviour of the good and bad Angels In the last is the Conduct of  Adam  and  Eve  who are the principal Actors in the Poem  IN the Description of  Paradise  the Poet has observed  Aristotle  's Rule of lavishing all the Ornaments of Diction on the weak unactive Parts of the Fable which are not supported by the Beauty of Sentiments and Characters Accordingly the Reader may observe that the Expressions are more florid and elaborate in these Descriptions than in most other Parts of the Poem I must further add that tho' the  Drawings  of Gardens Rivers Rainbows and the like dead Pieces of Nature are justly censured in an heroic Poem when they run out into an unnecessary Length the Description of  Paradise  would have been faulty had not the Poet been very particular in it not only as it is the Scene of the principal Action but as it is requisite to give us an Idea of that Happiness from which our first Parents fell The Plan of it is wonderfully beautiful and formed upon the short Sketch which we have of it in Holy Writ  Milton  's Exuberance of Imagination has poured forth such a Redundancy of Ornaments on this Seat of Happiness and Innocence that it would be endless to point out each Particular  I must not quit this Head without further observing that there is scarce a Speech of  Adam  or  Eve  in the whole Poem wherein the Sentiments and Allusions are not taken from this their delightful Habitation The Reader during their whole Course of Action always finds himself in the Walks of  Paradise  In short as the Criticks have remarked that in those Poems wherein Shepherds are Actors the Thoughts ought always to take a Tincture from the Woods Fields and Rivers so we may observe that our first Parents seldom lose Sight of their happy Station in any Thing they speak or do and if the Reader will give me Leave to use the Expression that their Thoughts are always  paradisiacal  WE are in the next Place to consider the Machines of the Fourth Book  Satan  being now within Prospect of  Eden  and looking round upon the Glories of the Creation is filled with Sentiments different from those which he discovered whilst he was in Hell The Place inspires him with Thoughts more adapted to it He reflects upon the happy Condition from whence he fell and breaks forth into a Speech that is softned with several transient Touches of Remorse and SelfAccusation But at length he confirms himself in Impenitence and in his Design of drawing Men into his own State  of Guilt and Misery This Conflict of Passions is raised with a great deal of Art as the Opening of his Speech to the Sun is very bold and noble  O thou that with surpassing Glory crown'd  Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God  Of this new World at whose Sight all the Stars  Hide their diminish'd Heads to thee I call  But with no friendly Voice and add thy Name  O  Sun  to tell thee how I hate thy Beams  That bring to my Remembrance from what State  I fell how glorious once above thy Sphere  THIS Speech is I think the finest that is ascribed to  Satan  in the whole Poem The Evil Spirit afterwards proceeds to make his Discoveries concerning our first Parents and to learn after what Manner they may be best attacked His bounding over the Walls of  Paradise  his sitting in the Shape of a Cormorant upon the Tree of Life which stood in the Center of it and overtopped all the other Trees of the Garden his alighting among the Herd of Animals which are so beautifully represented as playing about  Adam  and  Eve  together with his transforming himself into different Shapes in order to hear their Conversation are Circumstances that give an agreeable Surprize to the Reader and are devised with great Art to connect that Series of Adventures in which the Poet has engaged this great Artificer of Fraud  THE Thought of  Saian  's Transformation into a Cormorant and placing himself on the Tree of Life seems raised upon that Passage in the  Ilaid  where two Deities are described as perching on the Top of an Oak in the Shape of Vulturs  HIS planting himself at the Ear of  Eve  under the Form of a Toad in order to produce vain Dreams and Imaginations is a Circumstance of  the same Nature as his starting up in his own Form is wonderfully fine both in the literal Description and in the Moral which is concealed under it His Answer upon his being discovered and demanded to give an Account of himself is conformable to the Pride and Intrepidity of his Character  Know ye not then said  Satan  fill'd with Scorn  Know ye not Me ye knew me once ne Mate  For You there sitting where you durst not soare  Not to know Me argues yourselves unknown  The lowest of your throng  ZEPHON  's Rebuke with the Influence it had on  Satan  is exquisitely graceful and moral  Satan  is afterwards led away to  Gabriel  the chief of the guardian Angels who kept Watch in  Paradise  His disdainful Behaviour on this Occasion is so remarkable a Beauty that the most ordinary Reader cannot but take Notice of it  Gabriel  's discovering his Approach at a Distance is drawn with great Strength and Liveliness of Imagination  O Friends I hear the tread of nimble Feet  Hast'ning this Way and now by glimps discern  Ithuriel  and  Zephon  through the shade  And with them comes a third of regal Port  But faded splendor wan who by his gait  And fierce demeanor seems the Prince of Hell  Not likely to part hence without contest  Stand firm for in his look defiance lours  THE Conference between  Gabriel  and  Satan  abounds with Sentiments proper for the Occasion and suitable to the Persons of the two Speakers  Satan  's cloathing himself with Terror when he Prepares for the Combat is truly sublime and at  least equal to  Homer  's Description of Discord celebrated by  Longinus  or to that of Fame in  Virgil  who are both represented with their Feet standing upon the Earth and their Heads reaching above the Clouds  While thus he spake th' Angelic Squadron bright  Turn'd fiery red sharpning in mooned Horns  Their Phalanx and began to hem him round  With ported Spears  c  On th' other Side  Satan  alarm'd  Collecting all his might dilated stood  Like  Teneriff  or  Atlas  unremov'd  His Stature reach'd the Sky and on his Crest  Sat horrour plum'd  I must here take notice that  Milton  is every where full of Hints and sometimes literal Translations taken from the greatest of the  Greek  and  Latin  Poets But this I may reserve for a Discourse by it self because I would not break the Thread of these Speculations that are designed for  English  Readers with such Reflections as would be of no Use but to the Learned  I must however observe in this Place that the breaking off the Combat between  Gabriel  and  Satan  by the hanging out of the golden Scales in Heaven is a Refinement upon  Homer  's Thought who tells us that before the Battle between  Hector  and  Achilles Jupiter  weighed the Event of it in a Pair of Scales The Reader may see the whole Passage in the d  Iliad  VIRGIL  before the last decisive Combat describes  Jupiter  in the same Manner as weighing the Fates of  Turnus  and  Aeneas Milton  though he fetched this beautiful Circumstance from the  Iliad  and  Aeneid  does not only insert it as a poetical Embellishment like the Authors abovementioned  but makes an artful Use of it for the proper carrying on of his Fable and for the breaking off the Combat between the two Warriors who were upon the Point of engaging To this we may further add that  Milton  is the more justified in this Passage as we find the same noble Allegory in Holy Writ where a wicked Prince some few Hours before he was assaulted and slain is said to have been  weigh'd in the Scales and to have been found wanting  I must here take Notice under the Head of the Machines that  Ʋriel  's gliding down to the Earth upon a Sunbeam with the Poet's Device to make him  descend  as well in his Return to the Sun as in his coming from it is a Prettiness that might have been admired in a little fanciful Poet but seems below the Genius of  Milton  The Description of the Host of armed Angels walking their nightly Round in  Paradise  is of another Spirit  So saying on he led his radiant files  Dazling the Moon  as that Account of the Hymns which our first Parents used to hear them sing in these their MidnightWalks is altogether Divine and inexpressibly amusing to the Imagination  WE are in the last Place to consider the Parts which  Adam  and  Eve  act in the fourth Book The Description of them as they first appeared to  Satan  is exquisitely drawn and sufficient to make the fallen Angel gaze upon them with all that Astonishment and those Emotions of Envy in which he is represented  Two of far nobler Shape erect and tall  Godlike erect with native honour clad  In naked Majesty seem'd lords of all  And worthy seem'd for in their looks Divine  The Image of their glorious Maker shon  Truth Wisdom Sanctitude severe and pure  Severe but in true filial Freedom plac'd  For Contemplation he and valour form'd  For softness she and sweet attractive Grace  He for God only she for God in him  His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar'd  Absolute Rule and  Hyacinthin  Locks  Round from his parted forelock manly hung  Clustring but not beneath his Shoulders broad  She as a Vail down to her slender Waste  Her unadorned golden Tresses wore  Disshevel'd but in wanton Ringlets wav'd  So pass'd they naked on nor shun'd the Sight  Of God or Angel for they Thought no ill  So Hand in Hand they pass'd the loveliest Pair  That ever since in love's Embraces met  THERE is a fine Spirit of Poetry in the Lines which follow wherein they are described as sitting on a Bed of Flowers by the Side of a Fountain amidst a mixed Assembly of Animals  THE Speeches of these two first Lovers flow equally from Passion and Sincerity The Professions they make to one another are full of Warmth but at the same Time founded on Truth In a Word they are the Gallantries of  Paradise  When  Adam  first of Men  Sole Partner and sole Part of all these Joys  Dearer thy self than all  But let us ever praise him and extol  His bounty following our delightful task  To prune those growing plants and tend these flowers  Which were it toilsome yet with thee were sweet  To whom thus  Eve  reply'd O thou for whom  And from whom I was form'd Flesh of thy Flesh  And without whom am to no end my Guide  And Head what thou hast said is just and right  For we to him indeed all Praises owe  And daily Thanks I chiefly who enjoy  So far the happier Lot enjoying thee  Praeeminent by so much odds while thou  Like Consort to thy self canst no where find  c  THE remaining Part of  Eve  's Speech in which she gives an Account of her self upon her first Creation and the Manner in which she was brought to  Adam  is I think as beautiful a Passage as any in  Milton  or perhaps in any other Poet whatsoever These Passages are all worked off with so much Art that they are capable of pleasing the most delicate Reader without offending the most severe  That Day I oft remember when from Sleep  c  A Poet of less Judgment and Invention than this great Author would have found it very difficult to have filled these tender Parts of the Poem with Sentiments proper for a State of Innocence to have described the Warmth of Love and the Professions of it without Artifice or Hyperbole to have made the Man speak the most endearing Things without descending from his natural Dignity and the Woman receiving them without Departing from the Modesty of her Character in a Word to adjust the Prerogatives of Wisdom and Beauty and make each appear to the other in its proper Force and Loveliness This mutual Subordination of the two Sexes is wonderfully kept up in the whole Poem as particularly in the Speech of  Eve  I have beforementioned and upon the Conclusion of it in the following Lines  So spake our general Mother and with Eyes  Of conjugal Attraction unreprov'd  And meek surrender half embracing lean'd  On our first Father half her swelling breast  Naked met his under the flowing Gold  Of her loose Tresses hid he in Delight  Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms  Smil'd with Superior Love  THE Poet adds that the Devil turned away with Envy at the Sight of so much Happiness  WE have another View of our first Parents in their evening Discourses which is full of pleasing Images and Sentiments suitable to their Condition and Characters The Speech of  Eve  in particular is dressed up in such a soft and natural Turn of Words and Sentiments as cannot be sufficiently admired  I shall close my Reflections upon this Book with observing the masterly Transition which the Poet makes to their Evening Worship in the following Lines  Thus at their shadie lodge arriv'd both stood  Both turn'd and under open Sky ador'd  The God that made both Sky Air Earth and Heav'n  Which they beheld the Moons resplendent Globe  And Starry Pole  Thou also mad'st the Night  Maker omnipotent and thou the Day  c  MOST of the modern heroic Poets have imitated the Ancients in beginning a Speech without premising that the Person said thus or thus but as it is easie to imitate the Ancients in the Omission of two or three Words it requires Judgment to do it in such a Manner as they shall not be missed and that the Speech may begin naturally without them There is a fine Instance of this Kind out of  Homer  in the Twenty Third Chapter of  Longinus  SPECTATOR N  o    Major rerum mihi nascitur ordo  Virg  WE were told in the foregoing Book how the Evil Spirit practised upon  Eve  as she lay asleep in order to inspire her with Thoughts of Vanity Pride and Ambition The Author who shews a wonderful Art throughout his whole Poem in preparing the Reader for the several Occurrences that arise in it founds upon the above mention'd Circumstance the First Part of the Fifth Book  Adam  upon his Awaking finds  Eve  still asleep with an unusual Discomposure in her Looks The Posture in which he regards her is described with a Tenderness not to be express'd as the Whisper with which he awakens her is the softest that ever was conveyed to a Lover's Ear  His wonder was to find unwaken'd Eve  With Tresses discompos'd and glowing cheek  As through unquiet rest he on his side  Leaning halfrais'd with looks of cordial love  Hung over her enamour'd and beheld  Beauty which whether waking or asleep  Shot forth peculiar Graces then with voice  Mild as when  Zephyrus  on  Flora  breathes  Her Hand soft touching whisper'd thus Awake  My fairest my espous'd my latest found  Heav'ns last best gift my ever new delight  Awake the morning shines and the fresh field  Calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring  Our tended plants how blows the Citron Grove  What drops the Myrrhe and what the balmie Reed  How Nature paints her colours how the Bee  Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet  Such Whispering wak'd her but with startled Eye  On  Adam  whom embracing thus she spake  O Sole in whom my thoughts find all Repose  My glory my perfection glad I see  Thy face and morn return'd  I cannot but take Notice that  Milton  in the Conferences between  Adam  and  Eve  had his Eye very frequently upon the Book of  Canticles  in which there is a noble Spirit of Eastern Poetry and very often not unlike what we meet with in  Homer  who is generally placed near the Age of  Solomon  I think there is no Question but the Poet in the preceding Speech remember'd those two Passages which are spoken on the like Occasion and fill'd with the same pleasing Images of Nature  MY beloved spake and said unto me Rise up my love my fair one and come away For lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the Earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the Voice of the Turtle is heard in our Land The figtree putteth forth her green figs and the Vines with the tender grape give a good smell Arise my Love my fair one and come away  COME my beloved let us go forth into the Field let us get up early to the Vineyards let us see if the Vine flourish whether the tender Grape appear and the Pomegranates bud forth  HIS preferring the Garden of  Eden  to that  Where the  Sapient  King  Held Dalliance with his fair  Egyptian  Spouse  shews that the Poet had this delightful Scene in his Mind  EVE  's Dream is full of those  high Conceits engendring Pride  which we are told the Devil endeavoured to instill into her Of this Kind is that Part of it where she fancies herself awaken'd by  Adam  in the following beautiful Lines  Why sleep'st thou  Eve  now is the pleasant time  The cool the silent save where silence yields  To the nightwarbling bird that now awake  Tunes sweetest his lovelabour'd song now reigns  Full orb'd the moon and with more pleasing light  Shadowy sets off the face of things In vain  If none regard Heav'n wakes with all his eyes  Whom to behold but thee Nature's desire  In whose sight all things joy with ravishment  Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze  AN injudicious Poet would have made  Adam  talk thro' the whole Work in such Sentiments as these But Flattery and Falshood are not the Courtship of  Milton  's  Adam  and could not be heard by  Eve  in her State of Innocence excepting only in a Dream produc'd on purpose to taint her Imagination Other vain Sentiments of the same Kind in this Relation of her Dream will be obvious to every Reader Tho' the Catastrophe of the Poem is finely presaged on this Occasion the Particulars of it are so artfully shadow'd that they do not anticipate the Story which follows in the Ninth Book I shall only add that tho' the Vision it self is founded upon Truth the Circumstances of it are full of that Wildness and Inconsistency which are natural to a Dream  Adam  conformable to his superior Character for Wisdom instructs and Comforts  Eve  upon this Occasion  So chear'd he his fair Spouse and she was chear'd  But silently a gentle tear let fall  From either eye and wip'd them with her hair  Two other precious drops that ready stood  Each in their chrystal sluice he e'cr they fell  Kiss'd as the gracious Signs of sweet remorse  And pious awe that fear'd to have offended  THE Morning Hymn is written in Imitation of one of those Psalms where in the Overflowings of Gratitude and Praise the Psalmist calls not only upon the Angels but upon the most conspicuous Parts of the inanimate Creation to joyn with him in extolling their Common Maker Invocations of this Nature fill the Mind with glorious Ideas of God's Works and awaken that divine Euthusiasm which is so natural to Devotion But if this Calling upon the dead Parts of Nature is at all Times a proper Kind of Worship it was in a particular Manner suitable to our first Parents who had the Creation fresh upon their Minds and had not seen the various Dispensations of Providence nor consequently could be acquainted with those many Topicks of Praise which might afford Matter to the Devotions of their Posterity I need not remark the beautiful Spirit of Poetry which runs through this whole Hymn nor the Holiness of that Resolution with which it concludes  HAVING already mentioned those Speeches which are assigned to the Persons in this Poem I proceed to the Description which the Poet gives of  Raphael  His Departure from before the Throne and his Flight thro' the Choirs of Angels is finely imaged As  Milton  every where fills his Poem with Circumstances that are marvellous and astonishing he describes the Gate of Heaven as framed after such a Manner that it open'd of it self upon the Approach of the Angel who was to pass through it  'till at the Gate  Of Heav'n arriv'd the gate selfopen'd wide  On golden Hinges turning as by work  Divine the Sovereign Architect had framed  THE Poet here seems to have regarded two or three Passages in the th  Iliad  as that in particular where speaking of  Vulcan Homer  says that he had made twenty  Tripodes  running on Golden Wheels which upon Occasion might go of themselves to the Assembly of the Gods and when there was no more Use for them return again after the same Manner  Scaliger  has rallied  Homer  very severely upon this Point as M  Dacier  has endeavoured to defend it I will not pretend to determine whether in this Particular of  Homer  the Marvellous does not lose Sight of the Probable As the miraculous Workmanship of  Milton  's Gates is not so extraordinary as this of the  Tripodes  so I am persuaded he would not have mentioned it had not he been supported in it by a Passage in the Scripture which speaks of Wheels in Heav'n that had Life in them and moved of themselves or stood still in Conformity with the Cherubims whom they accompanied  THERE is no Question but  Milton  had this Circumstance in his Thoughts because in the following Book he describes the Chariot of the  Messiah  with  living  Wheels according to the Plan in  Ezekiel  's Vision  Forth rush'd with whirlwind sound  The Chariot of Paternal Deity  Flashing thick flames wheel within wheel undrawn  It self instinct with Spirit  I question not but  Bossu  and the two  Daciers  who are for vindicating every Thing that is censured  in  Homer  by something parallel in Holy Writ would have been very well pleased had they thought of confronting  Vulcan  's  Tripodes  with  Ezekiel  's Wheels  RAPHAEL  's Descent to the Earth with the Figure of his Person is represented in very lively Colours Several of the  French Italian  and  English  Poets have given a Loose to their Imaginations in the Description of Angels But I do not remember to have met with any so finely drawn and so conformable to the Notions which are given of them in Scripture as this in  Milton  After having set him forth in all his heavenly Plumage and represented him as alighting upon the Earth the Poet concludes his Description with a Circumstance which is altogether new and imagined with the greatest Strength of Fancy  Like  Maia  's Son he stood  And shook his plumes that Heav'nly fragrance fill'd  The Circuit wide  RAPHAEL  's Reception by the Guardian Angels his passing through the Wilderness of Sweets his distant Appearance to  Adam  have all the Graces that Poetry is capable of bestowing The Author afterwards gives us a particular Description of  Eve  in her Domestick Employments  So saying with dispatchful looks in haste  She turns on hospitable thoughts intent  What choice to chuse for delicacy best  What order so contriv'd as not to mix  Tastes not well joyn'd inelegant but bring  Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change  Bestirs her then  c    THOUGH in this and other Parts of the same Book the Subject is only the Housewifry of our First Parent it is set off with so many pleasing Images and strong Expressions as make it none of the least agreeable Parts in this Divine Work  THE natural Majesty of  Adam  and at the same Time his submissive Behaviour to the superior Being who had vouchsafed to be his Guest the solemn  Hail  which the Angel bestows upon the Mother of Mankind with the Figure of  Eve  ministring at the Table are Circumstances which deserve to be admired  RAPHAEL  's Behaviour is every Way suitable to the Dignity of his Nature and to that Character of a Sociable Spirit with which the Author has so judiciously introduced him He had received Instructions to converse with  Adam  as one Friend converses with another and to warn him of the Enemy who was contriving his Destruction Accordingly he is represented as sitting down at a Table with  Adam  and eating of the Fruits of  Paradise  The Occasion naturally leads him to his Discourse on the Food of Angels After having thus entered into Conversation with Man upon more indifferent Subjects he warns him of this Obedience and makes a natural Transition to the History of that fallen Angel who was employed in the Circumvention of our first Parents  HADI follow'd Monsieur  Bossu  's Method in my first Paper on  Milton  I should have dated the Action of  Paradise Lost  from the Beginning of  Raphael  's Speech in this Book as he supposes the Action of the  Aeneid  to begin in the second Book of that Poem I could alledge many Reasons for my drawing the Action of the  Aeneid  rather from its immediate Beginning in the first Book than from its remote Beginning in the second and shew why I have considered the sacking of  Troy  as an  Episode  according to the common Acceptation of that Word But as this would be a dry unentertaining Piece of Criticism and perhaps unnecessary to those who have read my first Paper I shall not enlarge upon it Whichever of the Notions be true the Unity of  Milton  's Action is preserved according to either of them whether we consider the Fall of Man in its immediate Beginning as proceeding from the Resolutions taken in the infernal Council or in its more remote Beginning as proceeding from the first Revolt of the Angels in Heaven The Occasion which  Milton  assigns for this Revolt as it is founded on Hints in Holy Writ and on the Opinion of some great Writers so it was the most proper that the Poet could have made use of  THE Revolt in Heaven is described with great Force of Indignation and a fine Variety of Circumstances The learned Reader cannot but be pleased with the Poet's Imitation of  Homer  in the last of the following Lines  At length into the limits of the North  They came and Satan took his Royal Seat  High on a Hill far blazing as a Mount  Rais'd on a Mount with Pyramids and Tow'rs  From Diamond Quarries hewn and Rocks of Gold  The Palace of great  Lucifer  so call  That Structure in the Dialect of Men  Interpreted  HOMER  mentions Persons and Things which he tells us in the Language of the Gods are call'd by different Names from those they go by in the Language of Men  Milton  has imitated him with his usual Judgment in this particular Place wherein he has likewise the Authority of Scripture to justify him The Part of  Abdiel  who was the only  Spirit that in this infinite Host of Angels preserved his Allegiance to his Maker exhibits to us a noble Moral of religious Singularity The Zeal of the Seraph breaks forth in a becoming Warmth of Sentiments and Expressions as the Character which is given us of him denotes that generous Scorn and Intrepidity which attends heroic Virtue The Author doubtless designed it as a Pattern to those who live among Mankind in their present State of Degeneracy and Corruption  So spake the Seraph  Abdiel  faithful found  Among the faithless faithful only he  Among innumerable false unmov'd  Ʋnshaken unseduc'd unterrify'd  His Loyalty he kept his Love his Zeal  Nor Number nor Example with him wrought  To swerve from Truth or change his constant mind  Though single From amidst them forth he pass'd  Long Way through hostile Scorn which he sustain'd  Superior nor of Violence fear'd ought  And with retorted Scorn his Back he turn'd  On those proud Tow'rs to swift Distruction doom'd  SPECTATOR N  o    vocat in certamina Divos  Virg  WE are now entering upon the Sixth Book of  Paradise Lost  in which the Poet describes the Battel of Angels having raised his Reader's Expectation and prepar'd him for it by several Passages in the preceding Books I omitted quoting these Passages in my Observations on the  former Books having purposely reserved them for the Opening of this the Subject of which gave Occasion to them The Author's Imagination was so inflamed with this great Scene of Action that wherever he speaks of it he rises if possible above himself Thus where he mentions  Satan  in the Beginning of his Poem  Him the Almighty Power  Hurt'd headlong flaming from th' Etherial Skie  With hideous ruin and combustion down  To bottomless perdition there to dwell  In Adamantine Chains and Penal Fire  Who durst defie the Omnipotent to Arms  WE have likewise several noble Hints of it in the infernal Conference  O Prince O Chief of many throned Powers  That led th' embattel'd Seraphim to War  Too well I see and rue the dire event  That with sad overthrow and foul defect  Hath lost us Heav'n and all this mighty host  In horrible destruction laid thus low  But see the angry Victor has recall'd  His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit  Back to the gates of Heav'n The Sulphurous hail  Shot after us in Storm o'erblown hath laid  The fiery Surge that from the Precipice  Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling and the Thunder  Wing'd with red lightning and impetuous rage  Perhaps hath spent his Shafts and ceases now  To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep  THERE are several other very sublime Images on the same Subject in the First Book as also in the Second  What when we fled amain pursu'd and strook  With Heav'n's afflicting Thunder and besought  The Deep to shelter us this Hell then seem'd  A refuge from those wounds  IN short the Poet never mentions any thing of this Battel but in such Images of Greatness and Terrour as are suitable to the Subject Among several others I cannot forbear quoting that Passage where the Power who is describ'd as presiding over the Chaos speaks in the Third Book  Thus  Satan  and him thus the Anarch old  With faultring speech and visage incompos'd  Answer'd I know thee Stranger who thou art  That mighty leading Angel who of late  Made head against Heav'ns King tho' overthrown  I saw and hoard for such a numerous Host  Fled not in Silence through the frighted Deep  With ruin upon ruin rout on rout  Confusion worse confounded and Heav'ns Gates  Pour'd out by Millions her victorious Bands  Pursuing  IT required great Pregnacy of Invention and Strength of Imagination to fill this Battel with such Circumstances as should raise and astonish the Mind of the Reader and at the same time an Exactness of Judgment to avoid every thing that might appear light or trivial Those who look into  Homer  are surpriz'd to find his Battels still rising one above another and improving in Horrour to the Conclusion of the  Iliad Milton  's Fight of Angels is wrought up with the same Beauty It is usher'd in with such Signs of Wrath as are suitable to Omnipotence incensed The first Engagement is carried on under a Cope of Fire occasion'd by the Flights of innumerable burning  Darts and Arrows which are discharged from either Host The second Onset is still more terrible as it is filled with those artificial Thunders which seem to make the Victory doubtful and produce a kind of Consternation even in the Good Angels This is follow'd by the tearing up of Mountains and Promontories 'till in the last Place  Messiah  comes forth in the Fullness of Majesty and Terrour The Pomp of his Appearance amidst the Roarings of his Thunders the Flashes of his Lightnings and the Noise of his ChariotWheels is described with the utmost Flights of Humane Imagination  THERE is nothing in the first and last Day's Engagement which does not appear natural and agreeable enough to the Ideas most Readers would conceive of a Fight between two Armies of Angels  THE second Day's Engagement is apt to startle an Imagination which has not been raised and qualified for such a Description by the reading of the antient Poets and of  Homer  in particular It was certainly a very bold Thought in our Author to ascribe the first Use of Artillery to the Rebel Angels But as such a pernicious Invention may be well supposed to have proceeded from such Authors so it entered very properly into the Thoughts of that Being who is all along described as aspiring to the Majesty of his Maker Such Engines were the only Instruments he could have made use of to imitate those Thunders that in all Poetry both Sacred and Prophane are represented as the Arms of the Almighty The tearing up the Hills was not altogether so daring a Thought as the former We are in some measure prepared for such an Incident by the Description of the Giants War which we meet with among the ancient Poets What still made this Circumstance  the more proper for the Poet's Use is the Opinion of many Learned Men that the Fable of the Giants War which makes so great a Noise in Antiquity and gave Birth to the sublimest Description in  Hesiod  's Works was an Allegory founded upon this very Tradition of a Fight between the good and bad Angels  IT may perhaps be worth while to consider with what Judgment  Milton  in this Narration has avoided every thing that is mean and trivial in the Descriptions of the  Latin  and  Greek  Poets and at the same time improv'd every great Hint which he met with in their Works upon this Subject  Homer  in that Passage which  Longinus  has celebrated for its Sublimeness and which  Virgil  and  Ovid  have copied after him tells us that the Giants threw  Ossa  upon  Olympus  and  Pelion  upon  Ossa  He adds an Epithet to  Pelion    which very much swells the Idea by bringing up to the Reader's Imagination all the Woods that grew upon it There is further a great Beauty in his singling out by Name these three remarkable Mountains so well known to the  Greeks  This last is such a Beauty as the Scene of  Milton  's War could not possibly furnish him with  Cloudian  in his Fragment upon the Gyants War has given full Scope to that Wildness of Imagination which was natural to him He tells us that the Giants tore up whole Islands by the Roots and threw them at the Gods He describes one of them in particular taking up  Lemnos  in his Arms and whirling it to the Skies with all  Vulcan  's Shop in the midst of it Another tears up Mount  Ida  with the River  Enipeus  which ran down the Sides of it but the Poet not content to describe him with this Mountain upon his Shoulders tells us that the River flow'd down his Back as he held it up in that Posture It is visible to every judicious Reader  that such Ideas favour more of Burlesque than of the Sublime They proceed from a Wantonness of Imagination and rather divert the Mind than astonish it  Milton  has taken every thing that is Sublime in these several Passages and composes out of them the following great Image  From their Foundations loosning to and fro  They pluck'd the seated Hills with all their load  Rocks Waters Woods and by the shaggy tops  Ʋplifting bore them in their Hands  WE have the full Majesty of  Homer  in this short Description improved by the Imagination of  Claudian  without its Puerilities  I need not point out the Description of the fallen Angels seeing the Promontories hanging over their Heads in such a dreadful Manner with the other numberless Beauties in this Book which are so conspicuous that they cannot escape the Notice of the most ordinary Reader  THERE are indeed so many wonderful Strokes of Poetry in this Book and such a Variety of sublime Ideas that it would have been impossible to have given them a Place within the Bounds of this Paper Besides that I find it in a great measure done to my Hand at the End of my Lord  Roscommon  's Essay on translated Poetry I shall refer my Reader thither for some of the MasterStrokes in the Sixth Book of  Paradise Lost  though at the same time there are many others which that noble Author has not taken notice of  MILTON  notwithstanding the sublimeGenius he was Master of has in this Book drawn to his Assistance all the Helps he could meet with among the ancient Poets The Sword of  Michael  which makes so great a Havock among the bad Angels was given him we are told out of the Armory of God  But the Sword  Of  Michael  from the Armory of God  Was giv'n him temper'd so that neither keen  Nor solid might resist that edge it met  The Sword of  Satan  with steep force to smite  Descending and in half cut sheere  THIS Passage is a Copy of that in  Virgil  wherein the Poet tells us that the Sword of  AEneas  which was given him by a Deity broke into Pieces the Sword of  Turnus  which came from a mortal Forge As the Moral in this Place is Divine so by the way we may observe that the bestowing on a Man who is favour'd by Heav'n such an Allegorical Weapon is very conformable to the old Eastern Way of Thinking Not only  Homer  has made use of it but we find the  Jewish  Hero in the Book of  Maccabees  who had fought the Battels of the chosen People with so much Glory and Success receiving in his Dream a Sword from the Hand of the Prophet  Jeremiah  The following Passage wherein  Satan  is described as wounded by the Sword of  Michael  is in Imitation of  Homer  The griding Sword with discontinuous wound  Pass'd through him but th' Ethereal substance closed  Not long divisible and from the gash  A stream of Nectarous humour issuing flow'd  Sanguin such as celestial Spirits may bleed  nd all his Armour stain'd  HOMER  tells us in the same manner that upon  Diomedes  wounding the Gods there flow'd from the Wound an  Ichor  or pure kind of Blood which was not bred from Mortal Viands and that tho' the Pain was exquisitely great the Wound soon closed up and healed in those Beings who are vested with Immortality  I question not but  Milton  in his Description of his furious  Moloc  flying from the Battel and bellowing with the Wound he had received had his Eye on  Mars  in the  Iliad  who upon his being wounded is represented as retiring out of the Fight and making an Outcry louder than that of a whole Army when it begins the Charge  Homer  adds that the  Greeks  and  Trojans  who were engaged in a general Battel were terrified on each Side with the bellowing of this wounded Deity The Reader will easily observe how  Milton  has kept all the Horrour of this Image without running into the Ridicule of it  Where the might of  Gabriel  fought  And with fierce Ensigns pierc'd the deep array  Of  Moloc  furious King who him defy'd  And at his Chariot wheels to drag him bound  Threaten'd nor from the Holy One of Heav'n  Refrain'd his tongue blasphemous but anon  Down cloven to the waste with shatter'd Arms  And uncouth pain fled bellowing  MILTON  has likewise raised his Description in this Book with many Images taken out of the Poetical Parts of Scripture The Messiah's Chariot as  I  have before taken Notice is form'd upon a Vision of  Ezekiel  who as  Grotius  observes has very much in him of  Homer  's Spirit in the Poetical Parts of his Prophecy  THE following Lines in that glorious Commission which is given the Messiah to extirpate the Host of Rebel Angels is drawn from a sublime Passage in the Psalms  Go then thou mightiest in thy Father's might  Ascend my Chariot guide the rapid wheels  That shake Heaven's basis bring forth all my War  My Bow my Thunder my almighty Arms  Gird on thy Sword on thy puissant Thigh  THE Reader will easily discover many other Stroaks of the same Nature  THERE is no question but  Milton  had heated his Imagination with the Fight of the Gods in  Homer  before he entered upon this Engagement of the Angels  Homer  there gives us a Scene of Men Heroes and Gods mixed together in Battel  Mars  animates the contending Armies and lifts up his Voice in such a manner that it is heard distinctly amidst all the Shouts and Confusion of the Fight  Jupiter  at the same time thunders over their Heads while  Neptune  raises such a Tempest that the whole Field of Battel and all the Tops of the Mountains shake about them The Poet tells us that  Pluto  himself whose Habitation was in the very Center of the Earth was so affrighted at the Shock that he leapt from his Throne  Homer  afterwards describes  Vulcan  as pouring down a Storm of Fire upon the River  Xanthus  and  Minerva  as throwing a Rock at  Mars  who he tells us covered seven Acres in his Fall  AS  Homer  has introduced into his Battel of the Gods every thing that is great and terrible in Nature  Milton  has filled his Fight of Good and Bad Angels with all the like Circumstances of Horrour The Shout of Armies the Ratling of Brazen Chariots the Hurling of Rocks and Mountains the Earthquake the Fire the Thunder are all of them employ'd to lift up the Reader's Imagination and give him a suitable Idea of so great an Action With what Art has the Poet represented the whole Body of the Earth trembling even before it was created  All Heaven resounded and had Earth been then  All Earth had to its Center shook  IN how sublime and just a Manner does he afterwards describe the whole Heaven shaking under the Wheels of the  Messiah's  Chariot with that Exception to the Throne of God  Ʋnder his burning Wheels  The steadfast  Empyrean  shook throughout  All but the Throne it self of God  NOTWITHSTANDING the  Messiah  appears cloathed with so much Terrour and Majesty the Poet has still found Means to make his Readers conceive an Idea of him beyond what he himself was able to describe  Yet half his Strength he put not forth but checkt  His thunder in mid Volly for he meant  Not to destroy but root them out of Heav'n  IN a Word  Milton  's Genius which was so great in it self and so strenghened by all the Helps of Learning appears in this Book every way equal to his Subject which was the most sublime that could enter into the Thoughts of a Poet As he knew all the Arts of Affecting the Mind he knew it was necessary to give it certain Restingplaces and Opportunities of recovering it self from Time to Time He has therefore with great Address interspersed several Speeches Reflections Similitudes and the like Reliefs to diversifie his Narration and ease the Attention of the Reader that he might come fresh to his great Action and by such a Contrast of Ideas have a more lively Taste of the nobler Parts of his Description  SPECTATOR N  o    Ʋt his exordia primis  Omnia et ipse tener Mundi concreverit orbis  Tum durare solum et discludere Nerea ponto  Coeperit et rerum paullatim sumere formas  Virg  LONGINƲS  has observed that there may be a Loftiness in Sentiments where there is no Passion and brings Instances out of ancient Authors to support this his Opinion The Pathetick as that great Critick observes may animate and inflame the Sublime but is not essential to it Accordingly as he further remarks we very often find that those who excel most in stirring up the Passions very often want the Talent of writing in the great and sublime Manner and so on the contrary  Milton  has shewn himself a Master in both these Ways of Writing The seventh Book which we are now entering upon is an Instance of that Sublime which is not mixt and work'd up with Passion The Author appears in a kind of composed and sedate Majesty and tho' the Sentiments do not give so great an Emotion as those in the former Book they abound with as magnificent Ideas The sixth Book like a troubled Ocean represents Greatness in Confusion the seventh affects the Imagination like the Ocean in a Calm and Fills the Mind of the Reader without producing in it any Thing like Tumult or Agitation  THE Critick abovementioned among the Rules which he lays down for succeeding in the sublime  way of writing proposes to his Reader that he should imitate the most celebrated Authors who have gone before him and been engaged in Works of the same Nature as in particular that if he writes on a poetical Subject he should consider how  Homer  would have spoken on such an Occasion By this Means one great Genius often catches the Flame from another and writes in his Spirit without copying servilely after him There are a thousand shining Passages in  Virgil  which have been lighted up by  Homer  MILTON  tho' his own natural Strength of Genius was capable of furnishing out a perfect Work has doubtless very much raised and ennobled his Conceptions by such an Imitation as that which  Longinus  has recommended  IN this Book which gives us an Account of the Six Days Works the Poet received but very few Assistances from Heathen Writers who were Strangers to the Wonders of Creation But as there are many glorious Strokes of Poetry upon this Subject in Holy Writ the Author has numberless Allusions to them through the whole Course of this Book The great Critick I have before mentioned though an Heathen has taken Notice of the sublime Manner in which the Lawgiver of the  Jews  has described the Creation in the First Chapter of  Genesis  and there are many other Passages in Scripture which rise up to the same Majesty where this Subject is touched upon  Milton  has shewn his Judgment very remarkably in making use of such of these as were proper for his Poem and in duly qualifying those high Strains of Eastern Poetry which were suited to Readers whose Imaginations were set to an higher Pitch than those of colder Climates  ADAM  's Speech to the Angel wherein he desires an Account of what had passed within the Regions  of Nature before the Creation is very great and solemn The following Lines in which he tells him that the Day is not too far spent for him to enter upon such a Subject are exquisite in their Kind  And the Great Light of Day yet wants to run  Much of his race though steep suspense in Heav'n  Held by thy voice thy potent voice he hears  And longer will delay to hear thee tell  His Generation  c    THE Angel's encouraging our First Parents in a modest Pursuit after Knowledge with the Causes which he assigns for the Creation of the World are very just and beautiful The  Messiah  by whom as we are told in Scripture the Worlds were made comes forth in the Power of his Father surrounded with an Host of Angels and cloathed with such a Majesty as becomes his entering upon a Work which according to our Conceptions appears the utmost Exertion of Omnipotence What a beautiful Description has our Author raised upon that Hint in one of the Prophets  And behold there came four Chariots out from between two Mountains and the Mountains were Mountains of Brass  About his Chariot numberless were pour'd  Cherub  and  Seraph  Potentates and Thrones  And Virtues winged Spirits and Chariots wing'd  From the Armoury of God where stand of old  Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd  Against a solemn day harnest at hand  Celestial Equipage and now came forth  Spontaneous for within them Spirit liv'd  Attendant on their Lord Heav'n open'd wide  Her ever during Gates Harmonious sound  On golden Hinges moving  I have before taken Notice of these Chariots of God and of these Gates of Heaven and shall here only add that  Homer  gives us the same Idea of the latter as opening of themselves tho' he afterwards takes off from it by telling us that the  Hours  first of all removed those prodigious Heaps of Clouds which lay as a Barrier before them  I do not know any thing in the whole Poem more sublime than the Description which follows where the Messiah is represented at the Head of his Angels as looking down into the  Chaos  calming its Confusion riding into the midst of it and drawing the first OutLine of the Creation  On Heav'nly ground they stood and from the shore  They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss  Outrageous as a Sea dark wasteful wild  Ʋp from the bottom turn'd by furious winds  And surging waves as Mountains to assault  Heav'ns height and with the Center mix the Pole  Silence ye troubled Waves and thou Deep Peace  Said then th' Omnific word your Discord end  Nor staid but on the wings of Cherubim  Ʋplifted in Paternal Glory rode  Far into  Chaos  and the world unborn  For  Chaos  heard his voice him all his train  Follow'd in bright Procession to behold  Creation and the wonders of his might  Then staid the fervid Wheels and in his hand  He took the golden Compasses prepared  In God's eternal Store to circumscribe  This Ʋniverse and all created things  One foot he center'd and the other turn'd  Round through the vast profundity obscure  And said thus far extend thus far thy bounds  This be thy just Circumference O World  THE Thought of the Golden Compasses is conceiv'd altogether in  Homer  's Spirit and is a very noble Incident in this wonderful Description  Homer  when he speaks of the Gods ascribes to them several Arms and Instruments with the same Greatness of Imagination Let the Reader only peruse the Description of  Minerva  's  Aegis  or Buckler in the Fifth Book of the Iliad with her Spear which would overturn whole Squadrons and her Helmet that was sufficient to cover an Army drawn out of an hundred Cities The Golden Compasses in the abovementioned Passage appear a very natural Instrument in the Hand of him whom  Plato  somewhere calls the Divine Geometrician As Poetry delights in cloathing abstracted Ideas in Allegories and sensible Images we find a magnificent Description of the Creation form'd after the same manner in one of the Prophets wherein he describes the Almighty Architect as measuring the Waters in the Hollow of his Hand meteing out the Heavens with his Span comprehending the Dust of the Earth in a Measure weighing the Mountains in Scales and the Hills in a Balance Another of them describing the Supreme Being in this great Work of Creation represents him as laying the Foundations of the Earth and stretching a Line upon it And in another Place as garnishing the Heavens stretching out the North over the empty Place and hanging the Earth upon Nothing This last noble Thought  Milton  has express'd in the following Verse  And Earth selfbalanc'd on her Center hung  THE Beauties of Description in this Book lie so very thick that it is impossible to enumerate them in this Paper The Poet has employ'd on them the whole Energy of our Tongue The several great Scenes of the Creation rise up to view one  after another in such a Manner that the Reader seems present at this wonderful Work and to assist among the Choirs of Angels who are the Spectators of it How glorious is the Conclusion of the first Day  Thus was the first day Ev'n and Morn  Nor past uncelebrated nor unsung  By the Celestial Quires when Orient light  Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld  Birthday of Heav'n and Earth with joy and shout  The hollow universal Orb they fill'd  WE have the same Elevation of Thought in the third Day when the Mountains were brought forth and the Deep was made  Immediately the Mountains huge appear  Emergent and their broad bare backs upheave  Into the Clouds their tops ascend the Sky  So high as heav'd the tumid hills so low  Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep  Capacious bed of Waters  WE have also the Rising of the whole vegetable World describ'd in this Day's Work which is filled with all the Graces that other Poets have lavished on their Description of the Spring and leads the Reader's Imagination into a Theatre equally surprizing and beautiful  THE several Glories of the Heavens make their Appearance on the fourth Day  First in his East the glorious lamp was seen  Regent of day and all the Horizon round  Invested with bright rays jocund to run  His Longitude thro' Heav'ns high rode the Gray  awn and the  Pleiades  before him danced  Shedding sweet influence less bright the Moon  But opposite in levell'd West was set  His Mirror with full face borrowing her light  From him for other light she needed none  In that aspect and still the distance keeps  Till night then in the East her turn she shines  Revolv'd on Heav'ns great Axle and her reign  With thousand lesser lights dividual holds  With thousand thousand stars that then appear'd  Spangling the Hemisphere  ONE would wonder how the Poet could be so concise in his Description of the Six Days Works as to comprehend them within the Bounds of an Episode and at the same Time so particular as to give us a lively Idea of them This is still more remarkable in his Account of the fifth and sixth Days in which he has drawn out to our View the whole Animal Creation from the Reptil to the Behemoth As the Lion and the Leviathan are two of the noblest Productions in the World of living Creatures the Reader will find a most exquisite Spirit of Poetry in the Account which our Author gives us of them The Sixth Day concludes with the Formation of Man upon which the Angel takes Occasion as he did after the Battel in Heaven to remind  Adam  of his Obedience which was the principal Design of this his Visit  THE Poet afterwards represents the Messiah returning into Heaven and taking a Survey of his great Work There is something inexpressibly sublime in this part of the Poem where the Author describes that great Period of Time filled with so many glorious Circumstances when the Heavens and Earth were finished when the Messiah ascended up in Triumph through the Everlasting Gates when he looked down with Pleasure upon his new Creation when every Part of Nature seem'd to rejoice  in its Existence when the Morning Stars sang together and all the Sons of God shouted for Joy  So Ev'n and Morn accomplish'd the Sixth day  Yet not till the Creator from his Work  Desisting tho' unwearied up return'd  Ʋp to the Heav'n of Heav'ns his high abode  Thence to behold this new created World  Th' Addition of his Empire how it shew'd  In prospect from his throne how good how fair  Answering his great Idea Ʋp he rode  Follow'd with acclamation and the Sound  Symphonious of ten thousand harps that tuned  Angelic Harmonies the earth the air  Resoxnding thou remember'st for thou heard'st  The Heavens and all the Constellations rung  The Planets in their Station list'ning stood  While the bright pomp ascended jubilant  Open ye everlasting gates they sung  Open ye Heav'ns your living doors let in  The great Creator from his work return'd  Magnificent his six days work a World  I cannot conclude this Book upon the Creation without mentioning a Poem which has lately appear'd under that Title The Work was undertaken with so good an Intention and is executed with so great a Mastery that it deserves to be looked upon as one of the most useful and noble Productions in our  English  Verse The Reader cannot but be pleased to find the Depths of Philosophy enlivened with all the Charms of Poetry and to see so great a Strength of Reason amidst so beautiful a Redundancy of the Imagination The Author has shewn us that Design in all the Works of Nature which necessarily leads us to the Knowledge of its first Cause In short he has illustrated by numberless  and incontestable Instances that divine Wisdom which the Son of  Sirach  has so nobly ascribed to the Supreme Being in his Formation of the World when he tells us that  He created her and saw her and numbered her and poured her out upon all his Works  SPECTATOR N  o    Sanctius hic animal mentisque capacius altae  Decrat adhuc et quod dominari in caetera posset  Natus homo est  Ov Met  THE Accounts which  Raphael  gives of the Battel of Angels and the Creation of the World have in them those Qualifications which the Criticks judge requisite to an Episode They are nearly related to the principal Action and have a just Connection with the Fable  THE Eighth Book opens with a Beautiful Description of the Impression which this Discourse of the ArchAngel made on our first Parents  Adam  afterwards by a very natural Curiosity enquries concerning the Motions of those Celestial Bodies which make the most glorious Appearance among the six Days Works The Poet here with a great deal of Art represents  Eve  as withdrawing from this Part of their Conversation to Amusements more suitable to her Sex He well knew that the Episode in this Book which is filled with  Adam  's Account of his Passion and Esteem for  Eve  would have been improper for her Hearing and has therefore devised very just and beautiful Reasons for her retiring  So spake our Sire and by his Count'nance seem'd  Entring on studious Thoughts abstruse which  Eve  Perceiving where she sat retired in sight  With Lowliness majestick from her Seat  And Grace that won who saw to wish her Stay  Rose and went forth among her Fruits and Flowers  To visit how they prosper'd Bud and Bloom  Her Nursery they at her Coming sprung  And touch'd by her fair Tendance gladlier grew  Yet went she not as not with such Discourse  Delighted or not capable her Ear  Of what was high Such Pleasure she reserv'd  Adam  relating she sole Auditress  Her Husband the Relater she preferr'd  Before the Angel and of him to ask  Chose father he she knew would intermix  Grateful Digressions and solve high Dispute  With Conjugal Caresses from his Lip  Not Words alone pleased her O when meet now  Such Pairs in Love and mutual Honour joyn'd  THE Angel's returning a doubtful Answer to  Adam  's Enquiries was not only proper for the moral Reason which the Poet assigns but because it would have been highly absurd to have given the Sanction of an Archangel to any particular System of Philosophy The chief Points in the  Ptolemaick  and  Copernican  Hypothesis are described with great Conciseness and Perspicuity and at the same Time dressed in very pleasing and poetical Images  ADAM  to detain the Angel enters afterwards upon his own History and relates to him the Circumstances in which he found himself upon his Creation as also his Conversation with his Maker and his first meeting with  Eve  There is no Part of the Poem more apt to raise the Attention of the Reader than this Discourse of our great Ancestor as nothing can be more surprizing and delightful  to us than to hear the Sentiments that arose in the First Man while he was yet new and fresh from the Hands of his Creator The Poet has interwoven every thing which is delivered upon this Subject in Holy Writ with so many beautiful Imaginations of his own that nothing can be conceived more just and natural than this whole Episode As our Author knew this Subject could not but be agreeable to his Reader he would not throw it into the Relation of the six Days Works but reserved it for a distinct Episode that he might have an Opportunity of expatiating upon it more at large Before I enter on this Part of the Poem I cannot but take Notice of two shining Passages in the Dialogue between  Adam  and the Angel The first is that wherein our Ancestor gives an Account of the Pleasure he took in conversing with him which contains a very noble Moral  For while I sit with thee I seem in Heav'n  And sweeter thy Discourse is to my Ear  Than Fruits of Palmtree pleasantest to Thirst  And Hunger both from Labour at the Hour  Of sweet Repast they satiate and soon fill  Tho' pleasant but thy Words with Grace divine  Imbu'd bring to their Sweetness no Satiety  THE other I shall mention is that in which the Angel gives a Reason why he should be glad to hear the Story  Adam  was about to relate  For I that Day was absent as befell  Bound on a Voyage uncouth and obscure  Far on Excursion towards the Gates of Hell  Squar'd in full Legion such command we had  To see that none thence issued forth a Spy  Or Enemy while God was in his Work  Lest he incenst at such Eruption bold  Destruction with Creation might have mix'd  THERE is no Question but our Poet drew the Image in what follows from that in  Virgil  's Sixth Book where  Aeneas  and the Sybil stand before the Adamantine Gates which are there describ'd as shut upon the Place of Torments and listen to the Groans the Clank of Chains and the Noise of Iron Whips that were heard in those Regions of Pain and Sorrow  Fast we found fast shut  The dismal Gates and barricadoed strong  But long e'er our approaching heard within  Noise other than the Sound of Dance or Song  Torment and loud Lament and furious Rage  ADAM  then proceeds to give an Account of his Condition and Sentiments immediately after his Creation How agreeably does he represent the Posture in which he found himself the delightful Landskip that surrounded him and the Gladness of Heart which grew up in him on that Occasion  As new waked from soundest Sleep  Soft on the flowry Herb I found me laid  In balmy Sweat which with his Beams the Sun  Soon dried and on the reaking Moisture fed  Streight toward Heav'n my wondering Eyes I turn'd  And gaz'd a while the amply Sky till rais'd  By quick instinctive Motion up I sprung  As thitherward endeavouring and upright  Stood on my Feet About me round I saw  Hill Dale and shady Woods and sunny Plains  And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams by these  Creatures that liv'd and mov'd and walk'd or flew  Birds on the Branches warbling all things smil'd  With Fragrance and with Joy my Heart o'erflow'd  ADAM  is afterwards describ'd as surpriz'd at his own Existence and taking a Survey of himself and of all the Works of Nature He likewise is represented as discovering by the Light of Reason that he and every thing about him must have been the Effect of some Being infinitely good and powerful and that this Being had a Right to his Worship and Adoration His first Address to the Sun and to those Parts of the Creation which made the most distinguished Figure is very natural and amusing to the Imagination  Thou Sun said I fair Light  And thou enlight'ned Earth so fresh and gay  Ye Hills and Dales ye Rivers Woods and Plains  And ye that live and move fair Creatures tell  Tell if you saw how came I thus how here  HIS next Sentiment when upon his first going to sleep he fancies himself losing his Existence and falling away into nothing can never be sufficiently admired His Dream in which he still preserves the Consciousness of his Existence together with his Removal into the Garden which was prepared for his Reception are also Circumstances finely imagined and grounded upon what is delivered in sacred Story  THESE and the like wonderful Incidents in this Part of the Work have in them all the Beauties of Novelty at the same Time that they have all the Graces of Nature They are such as none but a great Genius could have thought of though upon the Perusal of them they seem to rise of themselves from the Subject of which he treats In a Word though they are natural they are not obvious  which is the true Character of all fine Writing  THE Impression which the Interdiction of the Tree of Life left in the Mind of our first Parent is described with great Strength and Judgment as the Image of the several Beasts and Birds passing in Review before him is very beautiful and lively  Each Bird and Beast behold  Approaching two and two these cowring low  With Blandishment each Bird stoop'd on his Wing  I nam'd them as they pass'd  ADAM  in the next Place describes a Conference which he held with his Maker upon the Subject of Solitude The Poet here represents the supreme Being as making an Essay of his own Work and putting to the Trial that reasoning Faculty with which he had endued his Creature  Adam  urges in this divine Colloquy the Impossibility of his being happy tho' he was the Inhabitant of  Paradise  and Lord of the whole Creation without the Conversation and Society of some rational Creature who should partake those Blessings with him This Dialogue which is supported chiefly by the Beauty of the Thoughts without other poetical Ornaments is as fine a Part as any in the whole Poem The more the Reader examines the Justness and Delicacy of its Sentiments the more he will find himself pleased with it The Poet has wonderfully preserved the Character of Majesty and Condescension in the Creator and at the same Time that of Humility and Adoration in the Creature as particularly in the following Lines  Thus I presumptuous and the Vision bright  As with a Smile more brightned thus reply'd  c  I with leave of Speech implor'd  And humble Deprecation thus reply'd  Let not my Words offend thee heavenly Power  My Maker be propitious while I speak  c  ADAM  then proceeds to give an Account of his second Sleep and of the Dream in which he beheld the Formation of  Eve  The new Passion that was awakened in him at the Sight of her is touched very finely  Ʋnder his forming Hands a Creature grew  Manlike but different Sex so lovely fair  That what seem'd fair in all the World seem'd now  Mean or in her summ'd up in her contain'd  And in her Looks which from that time infus'd  Sweetness into my Heart unfelt before  And into all things from her Air inspir d  The Spirit of Love and amorous Delight  ADAM  's Distress upon losing Sight of this beautiful Phantom with his Exclamations of Joy and Gratitude at the Discovery of a real Creature who resembled the Apparition which had been presented to him in his Dream the Approaches he makes to her and his Manner of Courtship are all laid together in a most exquisite Propriety of Sentiments  THO' this Part of the Poem is work'd up with great Warmth and Spirit the Love which is described in it is every way suitable to a State of Innocence If the Reader compares the Description which  Adam  here gives of his leading  Eve  to the Nuptial Bower with that which Mr  Dryden  has made on the same Occasion in a Scene of his  Fall of Man  he will be sensible of the great Care which  Milton  took to avoid all Thoughts on so delicate a Subject that might be offensive to Religion or good Manners The Sentiments are chaste but  not cold and convey to the Mind Ideas of the most transporting Passion and of the greatest Purity What a Noble Mixture of Rapture and Innocence has the Author joined together in the Reflection which  Adam  makes on the Pleasures of Love compared to those of Sense  Thus have I told thee all my State and brought  My Story to the Sum of earthly Bliss  Which I enjoy and must confess to find  In all things else Delight indeed but such  As us'd or not works in the mind no Change  Nor Vehement desire these delicacies  I mean of taste sight smell herbs fruits and flowers  Walks and the melody of Birds but here  Far otherwise transported I behold  Transported touch here Passion first I felt  Commotion strange in all enjoyments else  Superiour and unmov'd here only weak  Against the Charm of Beauty's powerful glance  Or Nature fail'd in me and left some part  Not proof enough such object to sustain  Or from my side subducting took perhaps  More than enough at least on her bestow'd  Too much of Ornament in outward shew  Elaborate of inward less exact  When I approach  Her loveliness so absolute she seems  And in herself compleat so well to know  Her own that what she wills to do or say  Seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best  All higher knowledge in her presence falls  Degraded Wisdom in discourse with her  Loses discountenanc'd and like folly shews  Authority and reason on her wait  As one intended first not after made  Occasionally and to consummate all  Greatness of Mind and nobleness their Seat  Build in her loveliest and create an awe  About her as a Guard angelick plac'd  THESE Sentiments of Love in our first Parent gave the Angel such an Insight into humane Nature that he seems apprehensive of the Evils which might befal the Species in general as well as  Adam  in particular from the Excess of this Passion He therefore fortifies him against it by timely Admonitions which very artfully prepare the Mind of the Reader for the Occurrences of the next Book where the Weakness of which  Adam  here gives such distant Discoveries brings about that fatal Event which is the Subject of the Poem His Discourse which follows the gentle Rebuke he receiv'd from the Angel shews that his Love however violent it might appear was still founded in Reason and consequently not improper for  Paradise  Neither her outside form so fair nor ought  In procreation common to all kinds  Though higher of the genial Bed by far  And with mysterious reverence I deem  So much delights me as those graceful acts  Those thousand decencies that daily flow  From all her words and actions mixt with love  And sweet compliance which declare unfeign'd  Ʋnion of Mind or in us both one Soul  Harmony to behold in wedded pair  ADAM  's Speech at parting with the Angel has in it a Deference and Gratitude agreeable to an inferior Nature and at the same Time a certain Dignity and Greatness suitable to the Father of Mankind in his State of Innocence  SPECTATOR N  o    In te omnis domus inclinata recumbit  Virg  IF we look into the three great Heroic Poems which have appear'd in the World we may observe that they are built upon very slight Foundations  Homer  lived near Years after the  Trojan  War and as the Writing of History was not then in use among the  Greeks  we may very well suppose that the Tradition of  Achilles  and  Ʋlysses  had brought down but very few Particulars to his Knowledge tho' there is no Question but he has wrought into his two Poems such of their remarkable Adventures as were still talked of among his Contemporaties  THE Story of  Aeneas  on which  Virgil  founded his Poem was likewise very bare of Circumstances and by that Means afforded him an Opportunity of embellishing it with Fiction and giving a full Range to his own Invention We find however that he has interwoven in the Course of his Fable the principal Particulars which were generally believed among the  Romans  of  Aeneas  his Voyage and Settlement in  Italy  THE Reader may find an Abridgment of the whole Story as collected out of the ancient Historians and as it was received among the  Romans  in  Dionysius Halicarnasseus  SINCE none of the Criticks have considered  Virgil  's Fable with relation to this History of  Aeneas  it may not perhaps be amiss to examine it in this Light so far as regards my present Purpose  Whoever looks into the Abridgment abovementioned will find that the Character of  Aeneas  is filled with Piety to the Gods and a superstitious Observation of Prodigies Oracles and Predictions  Virgil  has not only preserved this Character in the Person of  Aeneas  but has given a Place in his Poem to those particular Prophecies which he found recorded of him in History and Tradition The Poet took the Matters of Fact as they came down to him and circumstanced them after his own Manner to make them appear the more natural agreeable or surprizing I believe very many Readers have been shocked at that ludicrous Prophecy which one of the  Harpeys  pronounces to the  Trojans  in the Third Book namely that before they had built their intended City they should be reduced by Hunger to eat their very Tables But when they hear that this was one of the Circumstances that had been transmitted to the  Romans  in the History of  Aeneas  they will think the Poet did very well in taking Notice of it The Historian abovementioned acquaints us a Prophetess had foretold  Aeneas  that he should take his Voyage Westward till his Companions should eat their Tables and that accordingly upon his landing in  Italy  as they were eating their Flesh upon Cakes of Bread for want of other Conveniencies they afterwards fed on the Cakes themselves upon which one of the Company said merrily  We are eating our Tables  They immediately took the Hint says the Historian and concluded the Prophecy to be fulfilled As  Virgil  did not think it proper to omit so material a Particular in the History of  Aeneas  it may be worth while to consider with how much Judgment he has qualified it and taken off every thing that might have appeared improper for a Passage in an Heroic Poem The Prophetess who foretells it is an hungry  Harpy  as the Person who discovers it is young  Ascanius  Heus etiam mensas consumimus inquit lulus  SUCH an Observation which is beautiful in the Mouth of a Boy would have been ridiculous from any other of the Company I am apt to think that the changing of the  Trojan  Fleet into WaterNymphs which is the most violent Machine in the whole  Aeneid  and has given Offence to several Criticks may be accounted for the same way  Virgil  himself before he begins that Relation premises that what he was going to tell appeared incredible but that it was justified by Tradition What further confirms me that this Change of the Fleet was a celebrated Circumstance in the History of  Aeneas  is that  Ovid  has given a Place to the same  Metamorphosis  in his Account of the heathen Mythology  NONE of the Criticks I have met with having considered the Fable of the  Aeneid  in this Light and taken Notice how the Tradition on which it was founded authorizes those Parts in it which appear the most exceptionable I hope the Length of this Reflection will not make it unacceptable to the curious Part of my Readers  THE History which was the Basis of  Milton  's Poem is still shorter than either that of the  Iliad  or  Aeneid  The Poet has likewise taken Care to insert every Circumstance of it in the Body of his Fable The Ninth Book which we are here to consider is raised upon that brief Account in Scripture wherein we are told that the Serpent was more subtle than any Beast of the Field that he tempted the Woman to eat of the forbidden Fruit that she was overcome by this Temptation and that  Adam  followed her Example From these few Particulars  Milton  has formed one of the most entertaining Fables that Invention ever produced He has disposed of these several Circumstances among so  many agreeable and natural Fictions of his own that his whole Story looks only like a Comment upon sacred Writ or rather seems to be a full and compleat Relation of what the other is only an Epitome I have insisted the longer on this Consideration as I look upon the Dispositionand Contrivance of the Fable to be the principal Beauty of the Ninth Book which has more  Story  in it and is fuller of Incidents than any other in the whole Poem  Satan  's traversing the Globe and still keeping within the Shadow of the Night as fearing to be discovered by the Angel of the Sun who had before detected him is one of those beautiful Imaginations with which he introduces this his second Series of Adventures Having examined the Nature of every Creature and found out one which was the most proper for his Purpose he again returns to Paradise and to avoid Discovery sinks by Night with a River that ran under the Garden and rises up again through a Fountain that issued from it by the Tree of Life The Poet who as we have before taken Notice speaks as little as possible in his own Person and after the Example of  Homer  fills every Part of his Work with Manners and Characters introduces a Soliloquy of this infernal Agent who was thus restless in the Destruction of Man He is then describ'd as gliding through the Garden under the Resemblance of a Mist in order to find out that Creature in which he design'd to tempt our first Parents This Description has something in it very poetical and surprizing  So saying through each Thicket dank or dry  Like a black Mist low creeping he held on  His midnight Search where soonest he might find  The Serpent him fast sleeping soon he found  In Labyrinth of many a round selfroll'd  His head the midst well stor'd with subtle wiles  THE Author afterwards gives us a Description of the Morning which is wonderfully suitable to a Divine Poem and peculiar to that first Season of Nature He represents the Earth before it was curst as a great Altar breathing out its Incense from all Parts and sending up a pleasant Savour to the Nostrils of its Creator to which he adds a noble Idea of  Adam  and  Eve  as offering their Morning Worship and filling up the Universal Consort of Praise and Adoration  Now when as sacred Light began to dawn  In  Eden  on the humid Flowers that breathed  Their Morning Incense when all things that breath  From th' Earth's great Altar send up silent Praise  To the Creator and his Nostrils fill  With grateful Smell forth came the human Pair  And joyn'd their vocal Worship to the Choir  Of Creatures wanting Voice  THE Dispute which follows between our two first Parents is represented with great Art It proceeds from a Difference of Judgment not of Passion and is managed with Reason not with Heat It is such a Dispute as we may suppose might have happened in  Paradise  had Man continued happy and innocent There is a great Delicacy in the Moralities which are interspersed in  Adam  's Discourse and which the most ordinary Reader cannot but take Notice of That Force of Love which the Father of Mankind so finely describes in the Eighth Book and which is inserted in the foregoing Paper shews it self here in many fine Instances As in those fond Regards he cast towards  Eve  at her parting from him  Her long with ardent look his Eye pursued  Delighted but desiring more her stay  Oft he to her his Charge of quick Return  Repeated she to him as oft engaged  To be return'd by Noon amid the Bowre  IN his Impatience and Amusement during her Absence    Adam  the while  Waiting desirous her Return had wove  Of choicest Flowers a Garland to adorn  Her Tresses and her Rural Labours crown  As Reapers oft are wont their Harvest Queen  Great Joy he promised to his Thoughts and new  Solace in her Return so long delay'd  BUT particularly in that passionate Speech where seeing her irrecoverably lost he resolves to perish with her rather than to live without her  Some cursed Fraud  Or Enemy hath beguil'd thee yet unknown  And me with thee hath ruin'd for with Thee  Certain my Resolution is to Die  How can I live without thee how forego  Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd  To live again in these wild Woods forlorn  Should God create another  Eve  and I  Another Rib afford yet loss of thee  Would never from my Heart no no I feel  The link of Nature draw me Flesh of Flesh  Bone of my Bone thou art and from thy State  Mine never shall be parted Bliss or Woe  THE Beginning of this Speech and the Preparation to it are animated with the same Spirit as the Conclusion which I have here quoted  THE several Wiles which are put in Practice by the Tempter when he found  Eve  separated from her Husband the many pleasing Images of Nature which are intermixt in this Part of the Story with its gradual and regular Progress to the fatal Catastrophe are so very remarkable that it would be superfluous to point out their respective Beauties  I have avoided mentioning any particular Similitudes in my Remarks on this great Work because I have given a general Account of them in my Paper on the First Book There is one however in this Part of the Poem which I shall here quote as it is not only very beautiful but the closest of any in the whole Poem I mean that where the Serpent is describ'd as rolling forward in all his Pride animated by the evil Spirit and conducting  Eve  to her Destruction while  Adam  was at too great a Distance from her to give her his Assistance These several Particulars are all of them wrought into the following Similitude  Hope elevates and Joy  Brightens his Crest as when a wand'ring Fire  Compact of unctuous Vapour which the Night  Condenses and the Cold invirons round  Kindled through agitation to a Flame  Which oft they say some evil Spirit attends  Hovering and blazing with delusive Light  Misleads th' amaz'd Nightwanderer from his way  To Bogs and Mires and oft thro' Pond or Pool  There swallow'd up and lost from Succour far  THAT secret Intoxication of Pleasure with all those transient Flushings of Guilt and Joy which the Poet represents in our first Parents upon their eating the forbidden Fruit to those Flaggings of Spirit Damps of Sorrow and mutual Accusations which succeed it are conceiv'd with a wonderful  Imagination and described in very natural Sentiments  WHEN  Dido  in the Fourth  Aeneid  yielded to that fatal Temptation which ruin'd her  Virgil  tells us the Earth trembled the Heavens were filled with Flashes of Lightning and the Nymphs howled upon the Mountain Tops  Milton  in the same poetical Spirit has described all Nature as disturbed upon  Eve  's eating the forbidden Fruit  So saying her rash Hand in evil Hour  Forth reaching to the Fruit she pluckt she eat  Earth felt the Wound and Nature from her Seat  Sighing thro' all her Works gave Signs of Woe  That all was lost  UPON  Adam  's falling into the same Guilt the whole Creation appears a second time in Convulsions  He scrupled not to eat  Against his better Knowledge not deceiv'd  But fondly overcome with Female Charm  Earth trembled from her Entrails as again  In Pangs and Nature gave a second Groan  SKY lowred and muttering Thunder some sad Drops  Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin  AS all Nature suffer'd by the Guilt of our first Parents these Symptoms of Trouble and Consternation are wonderfully imagined not only as Prodigies but as Marks of her sympathizing in the Fall of Man  ADAM  's Converse with  Eve  after having eaten the forbidden Fruit is an exact Copy of that between  Jupiter  and  Juno  in the Fourteenth  Iliad Juno  there approaches  Jupiter  with the Girdle which she had received from  Venus  upon which he tells her that she appeared more charming and desirable  than she had ever done before even when their Loves were at the highest The Poet afterwards describes them as reposing on a Summet of Mount  Ida  which produced under them a Bed of Flowers the  Lotus  the  Crocus  and the  Hyacinth  and concludes his Description with their falling asleep  LET the Reader compare this with the following Passage in  Milton  which begins with  Adam  's Speech to  Eve  For never did thy Beauty since the Day  I saw thee first and wedded thee adorn'd  With all Perfections so inflame my Sense  With Ardor to enjoy thee fairer now  Than ever bounty of this virtuous Tree  So said be and forbore not glance or toy  Of amorous Intent well understood  Of  Eve  whose Eye darted contagious fire  Her hand he seised and to a shady bank  Thick overhead with verdant roof embowr'd  He led her nothing loath Flow'rs were the Couch  Pansies and Violets and Asphodel  And Hyacinth Earth's freshest softest Lap  There they their fill of Love and Love's disport  Took largely of their mutual guilt the Seal  The Solace of their Sin till dewy Sleep  Oppress'd them  AS no Poet seems ever to have studied  Homer  more or to have resembled him in the Greatness of Genius than  Milton  I think I should have given but a very imperfect Account of his Beauties if I had not observed the most remarkable Passages which look like Parallels in these two great Authors I might in the Course of these Criticisms have taken Notice of many particular Lines and Expressions which are translated from the  Greek  Poet  but as I thought this would have appeared too minute and overcurious I have purposely omitted them The greater Incidents however are not only set off by being shown in the same Light with several of the same Nature in  Homer  but by that means may be also guarded against the Cavils of the Tasteless or Ignorant  SPECTATOR N  o    quis talia fando  Temperet à lacrymis  Virg  THE Tenth Book of  Paradise Lost  has a greater Variety of Persons in it than any other in the whole Poem The Author upon the winding up of his Action introduces all those who had any Concern in it and shews with great Beauty the Influence which it had upon each of them It is like the last Act of a well written Tragedy in which all who had a Part in it are generally drawn up before the Audience and represented under those Circumstances in which the Determination of the Action places them  I shall therefore consider this Book under four Heads in relation to the Celestial the Infernal the Human and the Imaginary Persons who have their respective Parts allotted in it  TO begin with the Celestial Persons The Guardian Angels of  Paradise  are described as returning to Heaven upon the Fall of Man in order to approve their Vigilance their Arrival their Manner of Reception with the Sorrow which appeared in themselves and in those Spirits who are said to  Rejoice at the Conversion of a Sinner are very finely laid together in the following Lines  Ʋp into Heav'n from Paradise in haste  Th' angelick guards ascended mute and sad  For Man for of his state by this they knew  Much wond'ring how the subtle Fiend had stoln  Entrance unseen Soon as th' unwelcome news  From Earth arriv'd at Heaven Gate displeas'd  All were who heard dim sadness did not spare  That time Celestial visages yet mixt  With pity violated not their Bliss  About the newarriv'd in multitudes  Th' Aethereal People ran to hear and know  How all befell They tow'rds the Throne supream  Accountable made haste to make appear  With righteous plea their utmost vigilance  And easily approv'd when the most High  Eternal Father from his secret Cloud  Amidst in thunder utter'd thus his Voice  THE same Divine Person who in the foregoing Parts of this Poem interceded for our first Parents before their Fall overthrew the Rebel Angels and created the World is now represented as descending to  Paradise  and pronouncing Sentence upon the three Offenders The cool of the Evening being a Circumstance with which Holy Writ introduces this great Scene it is Poetically described by our Author who has also kept religiously to the Form of Words in which the three several Sentences were passed upon  Adam Eve  and the Serpent He has rather chosen to neglect the Numerousness of his Verse than to deviate from those Speeches which are recorded on this great Occasion The Guilt and Confusion of our first Parents standing naked before their Judge is touched with great Beauty Upon the Arrival of  Sin  and  Death  into the Works  of the Creation the Almighty is again introduced as speaking to his Angels that surrounded him  See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance  To waste and havock yonder World which I  So fair and good Created  c  THE following Passage is formed upon that glorious Image in Holy Writ which compares the Voice of an innumerable Host of Angels uttering Hallelujahs to the Voice of mighty Thunderings or of many Waters  He ended and the Heav'nly Audience loud  Sung Hallelujah as the sound of Seas  Through multitude that sung "Just are thy ways  "Righteous are thy Decrees in all thy Works  "Who can extenuate Thee  THOUGH the Author in the whole Course of his Poem and particularly in the Book we are now examining has infinite Allusions to Places of Scripture I have only taken notice in my Remarks of such as are of a Poetical Nature and which are woven with great Beauty into the Body of this Fable Of this kind is that Passage in the present Book where describing  Sin  and  Death  as marching through the works of Nature he adds  Behind her  Death  Close following pace for pace not mounted yet  On his pale Horse  Which alludes to that Passage in Scripture so wonderfully Poetical and terrifying to the Imagination  And I looked and behold a pale Horse and his Name that sat on him was  Death  and  Hell  followed with him and Power was given unto them over the fourth Part of the Earth to kill with Sword and with Hunger and with Sickness and with the Beasts of the Earth  Under this first Head of Celestial Persons  we must likewise take Notice of the Command which the Angels received to produce the several Changes in Nature and sully the Beauty of the Creation Accordingly they are represented as infecting the Stars and Planets with malignant Influences weakning the Light of the Sun bringing down the Winter into the milder Regions of Nature planting Winds and Storms in several Quarters of the Sky storing the Clouds with Thunder and in short perverting the whole Frame of the Universe to the Condition of its Criminal Inhabitants As this is a noble Incident in the Poem the following Lines in which we see the Angels heaving up the Earth and placing it in a different Posture to the Sun from what it had before the Fall of Man is conceived with that sublime Imagination which was so peculiar to this great Author  Some say he bid his Angels turn ascance  The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more  From the Sun's Axle they with labour push'd  Oblique the Centrick Globe  WE are in the second Place to consider the Infernal Agents under the View which  Milton  has given us of them in this Book It is observed by those who would set forth the Greatness of  Virgil  's Plan that he conducts his Reader through all the Parts of the Earth which were discovered in his Time  Asia Africk  and  Europe  are the several Scenes of his Fable The Plan of  Milton  's Poem is of an infinitely greater Extent and fills the Mind with many more astonishing Circumstances  Satan  having surrounded the Earth seven times departs at length from  Paradise  We then see him steering his Course among the Constellations and after having traversed the whole Creation pursuing his Voyage thro' the  Chaos  and entering into his own Infernal Dominions  HIS first Appearance in the Assembly of Fallen Angels is work'd up with Circumstances which give a delightful Surprize to the Reader but there is no Incident in the whole Poem which does this more than the Transformation of the whole Audience that follows the Account their Leader gives them of his Expedition The gradual Change of  Satan  himself is described after  Ovid  's Manner and may vie with any of those celebrated Transformations which are looked upon as the most Beautiful Parts in that Poet's Works  Milton  never fails of improving his own Hints and bestowing the last finishing Touches to every Incident which is admitted into his Poem The unexpected Hiss which rises in this Episode the Dimensions and Bulk of  Satan  so much superior to those of the Infernal Spirits who lay under the same Transformation with the annual Change which they are supposed to suffer are Instances of this Kind The Beauty of the Diction is very remarkable in this whole Episode as I have observed in the Sixth Paper of these Remarks the great Judgment with which it was contrived  THE Parts of  Adam  and  Eve  or the Humane Persons come next under our Consideration  Milton  's Art is no where more shewn than in his conducting the Parts of these our first Parents The Representation he gives of them without falsifying the Story is wonderfully contrived to influence the Reader with Pity and Compassion towards them Though  Adam  involves the whole Species in Misery his Crime proceeds from a Weakness which every Man is inclined to pardon and commiserate as it seems rather the Frailty of Humane Nature than of the Person who offended Every one is apt to excuse a Fault which he himself might have fallen into It was the Excess of Love for  Eve  that ruin'd  Adam  and his Posterity I need  not add that the Author is Justify'd in this Particular by many of the Fathers and the most Orthodox Writers  Milton  has by this means filled a great part of his Poem with that kind of Writing which the  French  Criticks call the  Tender  and which is in a particular manner engaging to all sorts of Readers  ADAM  and  Eve  in the Book we are now considering are likewise drawn with such Sentiments as do not only interest the Reader in their Afflictions but raise in him the most melting Passions of Humanity and Commiseration When  Adam  sees the several Changes in Nature produced about him he appears in a Disorder of Mind suitable to one who had forfeited both his Innocence and his Happiness he is filled with Horror Remorse Despair in the Anguish of his Heart he expostulates with his Creator for having given him an unasked Existence  Did I request thee Maker from my Clay  To mould me Man did I solicit thee  From darkness to promote me or here place  In this delicious Garden as my will  Concurr'd not to my being 'twere but right  And equal to reduce me to my dust  Desirous to resign and render back  All I receiv'd  He immediately after recovers from his Presumption owns his Doom to be just and begs that the Death which is threatned him may be inflicted on him  Why delays  His Hand to execute what his decree  Fix'd on this day Why do I overlive  Why am I mock'd with Death and lengthen'd out  To Deathless pain how gladly would I meet  Mortality my Sentence and be Earth  Insensible how glad would lay me down  As in my Mother's lap there should I rest  And sleep secure his dreadful Voice no more  Would thunder in my ears no fear of worse  To me and to my Offspring would torment me  With cruel expectation  THIS whole Speech is full of the like Emotion and varied with all those Sentiments which we may suppose natural to a Mind so broken and disturb'd I must not omit that generous Concern which our first Father shews in it for his Posterity and which is so proper to affect the Reader  Hide me from the Face  Of God whom to behold was then my height  Of Happiness yet well if here would end  The Misery I deserv'd it and would bear  My own deservings but this will not serve  All that I eat or drink or shall beget  Is propagated Curse O voice once heard  Delightfully encrease  and  multiply  Now Death to hear  In me all  Posterity stands curst Fair Patrimony  That I must leave you Sons O were I able  To waste it all my self and leave you none  So disinherited how would you bless  Me now your curse Ah why should all Mankind  For one Man's fault thus guiltless be condemned  If guiltless But from me what can proceed  But all corrupt  WHO can afterwards behold the Father of Mankind extended upon the Earth uttering his Midnight Complaints bewailing his Existence and wishing for Death without sympathizing with him in his Distress  Thus  Adam  to himself lamented loud  Through the still night not now as e'er Man fell  Wholesome and cool and mild but with black Air  Accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom  Which to his evil Conscience represented  All things with double terrour on the Ground  Outstretch'd he lay on the cold Ground and oft  Curs'd his Creation Death as oft accus'd  Of tardy execution  THE Part of  Eve  in this Book is no less passionate and apt to sway the Reader in her Favour She is represented with great Tenderness as approaching  Adam  but is spurn'd from him with a Spirit of Upbraiding and Indignation conformable to the Nature of Man whose Passions had now gained the Dominion over him The following Passage wherein she is described as renewing her Addresses to him with the whole Speech that follows it have something in them exquisitely moving and Pathetick  He added not and from her turn'd but  Eve  Not so repuls'd with Tears that ceas'd not flowing  And Tresses all disorder'd at his Feet  Fell humble and embracing them besought  His peace and thus proceeded in her plaint  Forsake me not thus  Adam  witness Heav'n  What love sincere and reverence in my heart  I bear thee and unweeting have offended  Ʋnhappily deceiv'd thy Suppliant  I beg and clasp thy knees bereave me not  Whereon I live thy gentle looks thy aid  Thy Counfel in this uttermost distress  My only strength and stay Forlorn of thee  Whither shall I betake me where subsist  While yet we live scarce one short hour perhaps  Between us two let there be peace  c  ADAM  's Reconcilement to her is work'd up in the same Spirit of Tenderness  Eve  afterwards proposes to her Husband in the Blindness of her Despair that to prevent their Guilt from descending upon Posterity they should resolve to live Childless or if that could not be done they should seek their own Deaths by violent Methods As those Sentiments naturally engage the Reader to regard the Mother of Mankind with more than ordinary Commiseration they likewise contain a very fine Moral The Resolution of Dying to end our Miseries does not shew such a degree of Magnanimity as a Resolution to bear them and submit to the Dispensations of Providence Our Author has therefore with great Delicacy represented  Eve  as entertaining this Thought and  Adam  as disapproving it  WE are in the last Place to consider the Imaginary Persons or  Death  and  Sin  who act a large Part in this Book Such beautiful extended Allegories are certainly some of the finest Compositions of Genius but as I have before observed are not agreeable to the Nature of an Heroic Poem This of  Sin  and  Death  is very exquisite in its Kind if not considered as a Part of such a Work The Truths contained in it are so clear and open that I shall not lose Time in explaining them but shall only observe that a Reader who knows the Strength of the  English  Tongue will be amazed to think how the Poet could find such apt Words and Phrases to describe the Actions of those two imaginary Persons and particularly in that Part where  Death  is exhibited as forming a Bridge over the  Chaos  a Work suitable to the Genius of  Milton  SINCE the Subject I am upon gives me an Opportunity of speaking more at large of such Shadowy and Imaginary Persons as may be introduced into Heroic Poems I shall beg Leave to explain my  self in a Matter which is curious in its Kind and which none of the Criticks have treated of It is certain  Homer  and  Virgil  are full of imaginary Persons who are very beautiful in Poetry when they are just shewn without being engaged in any Series of Action  Homer  indeed represents  Sleep  as a Person and ascribes a short Part to him in his  Iliad  but we must consider that tho' we now regard such a Person as entirely shadowy and unsubstantial the Heathens made Statues of him placed him in their Temples and looked upon him as a Real Deity When  Homer  makes use of other such Allegorical Persons it is only in short Expressions which convey an ordinary Thought to the Mind in the most pleasing Manner and may rather be looked upon as Poetical Phrases than Allegorical Descriptions Instead of telling us that Men naturally fly when they are terrified he introduces the Persons of  Flight  and  Fear  who he tells us are inseparable Companions Instead of saying that the Time was come when  Apollo  ought to have received his Recompence he tells us that the  Hours  brought him his Reward Instead of describing the Effects which  Minerva  's  Aegis  produced in Battel he tells us that the Brims of it were encompassed by  Terrour Rout Discord Fury Pursuit Massacre  and  Death  In the same Figure of speaking he represents  Victory  as following  Diomedes Discord  as the Mother of Funerals and Mourning  Venus  as dressed by the  Graces Bellona  as wearing Terrour and Consternation like a Garment I might give several other Instances out of  Homer  as well as a great many out of  Virgil Milton  has likewise very often made use of the same way of Speaking as where he tells us that  Victory  sat on the Right Hand of the  Messiah  when he marched forth against the Rebel Angels that at the rising of the Sun the  Hours  unbarr'd the Gates of Light that  Discord  was the Daughter of  Sin  Of the same Nature are those Expressions where describing the Singing of the Nightingale he adds  Silence was pleased  and upon the  Messiah  's bidding Peace to the  Chaos Confusion heard his Voice  I might add innumerable Instances of our Poet's writing in this beautiful Figure It is plain that these I have mentioned in which Persons of an imaginary Nature are introduced are such short Allegories as are not designed to be taken in the literal Sense but only to convey particular Circumstances to the Reader after an unusual and entertaining Manner But when such Persons are introduced as principal Actors and engaged in a Series of Adventures they take too much upon them and are by no means proper for an Heroic Poem which ought to appear credible in its principal Parts I cannot forbear therefore thinking that  Sin  and  Death  are as improper Agents in a Work of this Nature as  Strength  and  Necessity  in one of the Tragedies of  Eschylus  who represented those two Persons nailing down  Prometheus  to a Rock for which he has been justly censured by the greatest Criticks I do not know any imaginary Person made use of in a more sublime manner of Thinking than that in one of the Prophets who describing God as descending from Heaven and visiting the Sins of Mankind adds that dreadful Circumstance  Before him went the Pestilence  It is certain this imaginary Person might have been described in all her purple Spots The  Fever  might have marched before her  Pain  might have stood at her Right Hand  Phrenzy  on her Left and  Death  in her Rear She might have been introduced as gliding down from the Tail of a Comet or darted upon the Earth in a Flash of Lightning She might have tainted the Atmosphere with her Breath the very Glaring of her Eyes might have scattered Infection But I believe every Reader will  think that in such sublime Writings the mentioning of her as it is done in Scripture has something in it more just as well as great than all that the most fanciful Poet could have bestowed upon her in the Richness of his Imagination  SPECTATOR N  o    Crudelis ubique  Luctus ubique pavor plurima Mortis Imago  Virg  MILTON  has shewn a wonderful Art in describing that Variety of Passions which arise in our first Parents upon the Breach of the Commandment that had been given them We see them gradually passing from the Triumph of their Guilt thro' Remorse Shame Despair Contrition Prayer and Hope to a perfect and compleat Repentance At the End of the Tenth Book they are represented as prostrating themselves upon the Ground and watering the Earth with their Tears To which the Poet joins this beautiful Circumstance that they offer'd up their penitential Prayers on the very Place where their Judge appeared to them when he pronounced their Sentence  They forthwith to the place  Repairing where he judg'd them prostrate fell  Before him reverent and both confess'd  Humbly their faults and pardon begg'd with tears  Watering the Ground  THERE is a Beauty of the same kind in a Tragedy of  Sophocles  where  Oedipus  after having  put out his own Eyes instead of breaking his Neck from the Palace Battlements which furnishes so elegant an Entertainment for our  English  Audience desires that he may be conducted to Mount  Cithaeron  in order to end his Life in that very Place where he was exposed in his Infancy and where he should then have died had the Will of his Parents been executed  AS the Author never fails to give a poetical Turn to his Sentiments he describes in the Beginning of this Book the Acceptance which these their Prayers met with in a short Allegory form'd upon that beautiful Passage in Holy Writ  And another Angel came and stood at the Altar having a golden Censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the Prayers of all Saints upon the Golden Altar which was before the Throne And the smoak of the incense which came with the Prayers of the Saints ascended up before God  To Heav'n their Prayers  Flew up nor miss'd the way by envious winds  Blown vagabond or frustrate in they pass'd  Dimentionless thro' heav'nly Doors then clad  With incense where the Golden Altar fumed  By their great Intercessor came in sight  Before the Father's throne  WE have the same Thought expressed a second Time in the Intercession of the  Messiah  which is conceived in very emphatick Sentiments and Expressions  AMONG the poetical Parts of Scripture which  Milton  has so finely wrought into this Part of his Narration I must not omit that wherein  Ezekiel  speaking of the Angels who appeared to him in a Vision adds that  every one had four faces  and that  their whole bodies and their backs and their hands and their wings were full of eyes round about  The Cohort bright  Of watchful Cherubim four faces each  Had like a double  Janus  all their Shape  Spangled with Eyes  THE assembling of all the Angels of Heaven to hear the solemn Decree passed upon Man is represented in very lively Ideas The Almighty is here describ'd as remembring Mercy in the midst of Judgment and commanding  Michael  to deliver his Message in the mildest Terms least the Spirit of Man which was already broken with the Sense of his Guilt and Misery should fail before him  Yet least they faint  At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd  For I behold them seftned and with tears  Bewailing their excess all Terror hide  THE Conference of  Adam  and  Eve  is full of moving Sentiments Upon their going abroad after the melancholy Night which they had passed together they discover the Lion and the Eagle pursuing each of them their Prey towards the Eastern Gates of  Paradise  There is a double Beauty in this Incident not only as it presents great and just Omens which are always agreeable in Poetry but as it expresses that Enmity which was now produced in the Animal Creation The Poet to shew the like Changes in Nature as well as to grace his Fable with a noble Prodigy represents the Sun in an Eclipse This particular Incident has likewise a fine Effect upon the Imagination of the Reader in regard to what follows for at the same Time that the Sun is under an Eclipse a bright Cloud descends in the Western Quarter of the Heavens filled with an Host of Angels and more luminous than the Sun it self The whole Theatre of Nature is darkned that this glorious Machine may appear in all its Lustre and Magnificence  Why in the East  Darkness e'er day's midcourse and morning light  More orient in that western Cloud that draws  O'er the blue firmament a radiant white  And slow descends with something heav'nly fraught  He err'd not for by this the heav'nly bands  Down from a Sky of Jasper lighted now  In Paradise and on a Hill made halt  A glorious apparition  I need not observe how properly this Author who always suits his Parts to the Actors whom he introduces has employed  Michael  in the Expulsion of our first Parents from  Paradise  The Archangel on this Occasion neither appears in his proper Shape nor in that familiar Manner with which  Raphael  the sociable Spirit entertained the Father of Mankind before the Fall His Person his Port and Behaviour are suitable to a Spirit of the highest Rank and exquisitely describ'd in the following Passage  Th' Archangel soon drew nigh  Not in his shape celestial but as Man  Clad to meet Man over his lucid Arms  A military Vest of Purple flow'd  Livelier than  Melibzan  or the grain  Of  Sarra  worn by Kings and Heroes old  In time of Truce  Iris  had dipt the Wooff  His starry Helm unbuckled shew'd him prime  In Manhood where Youth ended by his side  As in a glistring Zodiack hung the Sword  Satan's  dixe dread and in his Hand the Spear  Adam  bow'd low He kingly from his State  Inclined not but his coming thus declared  EVE  's Complaint upon hearing that she was to be removed from the Garden of  Paradise  is wonderfully Beautiful The Sentiments are not only  proper to the Subject but have something in them particularly soft and Womanish  Must I then leave thee Paradise thus leave  Thee native Soil these happy walks and shades  Fit haunt of Gods Where I had hope to spend  Quiet though sad the respite of that day  That must be mortal to us both O flow'rs  That never will in other Climate grow  My Early visitation and my last  At Even which I bred up with tender hand  From the first opening bud and gave you Names  Who now shall rear you to the Sun or rank  Your Tribes and Water from th'ambrosial Fount  Thee lastly nuptial Bowre by me adorn'd  With what to sight or smell was sweet from thee  How shall I part and whither wander down  Into a lower World to this obscure  And wild how shall we breath in other Air  Less pure accustom'd to Immortal Fruits  ADAM  's Speech abounds with Thoughts which are equally moving but of a more masculine and elevated Turn Nothing can be conceived more sublime and poetical than the following Passage in it  This most afflicts me that departing hence  As from his Face I shall be hid deprived  His blessed Count'nance here I could frequent  With worship place by place where he vouchsafed  Presence divine and to my Sons relate  On this Mount he appear'd under this Tree  Stood visible among these Pines his Voice  I heard here with him at this Fountain talk'd  So many grateful Altars I would rear  Of grassy Turf and pile up every Stone  Of lustre from the Brook in memory  Or Monument to Ages and thereon  Offer sweet smelling Gums and Fruits and Flowers  In yonder nether World where shall I seek  His bright Appearances or Footsteps trace  For though I fled him angry yet recall'd  To life prolong'd and promised race I nòw  Gladly behold though but his utmost Skirts  Of Glory and far off his Steps adore  THE Angel afterwards leads  Adam  to the highest Mount of  Paradise  and lays before him a whole Hemisphere as a proper Stage for those Visions which were to be represented on it I have before observed how the Plan of  Milton  's Poem is in many particulars greater than that of the  Iliad  or  Aeneid Virgil  's Hero in the last of these Poems is entertained with a sight of all these who are to descend from him but tho' that Episode is justly admired as one of the noblest Designs in the whole  Aeneid  every one must allow that this of  Milton  is of a much higher Nature  Adam  's Vision is not confined to any particular Tribe of Mankind but extends to the whole Species  IN this great Review which  Adam  takes of all his Sons and Daughters the first Objects he is presented with exhibit to him the Story of  Cain  and  Abel  which is drawn together with much Closeness and Propriety of Expression That Curiosity and natural Horror which arises in  Adam  at the Sight of the first Dying Man is touched with great Beauty  But have I now seen Death is this the way  I must return to native dust O Sight  Of terrour foul and ugly to behold  Horrid to Think how horrible to Feel  THE second Vision sets before him the Image of Death in a great Variety of Appearances The Angel to give him a general Idea of those Effects which his Guilt had brought upon his Posterity places before him a large Hospital or LazarHouse  fill'd with Persons lying under all kinds of mortal Diseases How finely has the Poet told us that the sick Persons languished under lingring and incurable Distempers by an apt and judicious use of such imaginary Beings as those I mentioned in my last Paper  Dire was the tossing deep the Groans  Despair  Tended the Sick busy from Couch to Couch  And over them triumphant  Death  his dart  Shook but delay'd to strike though oft invoked  With Vows as their chief good and final hope  THE Passion which likewise rises in  Adam  on this occasion is very natural  Sight so deform what Heart of rock could long  Dryeyed behold  Adam  could not but wept  Tho' not of Woman born Compassion quell'd  His best of Man and gave him up to tears  THE Discourse between the Angel and  Adam  which follows abounds with noble Morals  AS there is nothing more delightful in Poetry than a Contrast and Opposition of Incidents the Author after this melancholy Prospect of Death and Sickness raises up a Scene of Mirth Love and Jollity The secret Pleasure that steals into  Adam  's Heart as he is intent upon this Vision is imagined with great Delicacy I must not omit the Description of the loose female Troupe who seduced the Sons of God as they are called in Scripture  For that fair female troupe thou saw'st that seem'd  Of Goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay  Yet empty of all good wherein consists  Woman's domestick honour and chief praise  Bred only and compleated to the taste  Of lustful appetence to sing to dance  To dress and troule the Tongue and roul the Eye  To these that sober race of Men whose lives  Religious titled them the Sons of God  Shall yield up all their Virtue all their Fame  Ignobly to the Trains and to the smiles  Of those fair Atheists  THE next Vision is of a quite contrary Nature and filled with the Horrors of War  Adam  at the Sight of it melts into Tears and breaks out in that passionate Speech  O what are these  Death's ministers not Men who thus deal death  Inhumanly to Men and multiply  Ten thousand fold the Sin of him who flew  His Brother for of whom such Massacre  Make they but of their Brethren Men of Men  MILTON  to keep up an agreeable Variety in his Visions after having raised in the Mind of his Reader the several Ideas of Terror which are conformable to the Description of War passes on to those softer Images of Triumphs and Festivals in that Vision of Lewdness and Luxury which ushers in the Flood  AS it is visible that the Poet had his Eye upon  Ovid  's Account of the universal Deluge the Reader may observe with how much Judgment he has avoided every thing that is redundant or puerile in the  Latin  Poet We do not here see the Wolf swimming among the Sheep nor any of those wanton Imaginations which  Seneca  found fault with as unbecoming the great Catastrophe of Nature If our Poet has imitated that Verse in which  Ovid  tells us that there was nothing but Sea and that this Sea had no Shore to it he has not set the Thought in such a Light as to incur the Censure which Criticks have passed upon it The latter part of that Verse in  Ovid  is idle and superfluous but just and beautiful in  Milton  Jamque mare tellus nullum discrimen habebant  Nil nisi pontus erat deerant queque littera ponto  Ovid  Sea cover'd Sea  Sea without Shore  Milton  IN  Milton  the former part of the Description does not forestall the latter How much more great and solemn on this Occasion is that which follows in our  English  Poet  And in their Palaces  Where Luxury late reign'd Sea Monsters whelp'd  And stabl'd  than that in  Ovid  where we are told that the SeaCalfs lay in those Places where the Goats were used to browze The Reader may find several other parallel passages in the  Latin  and  English  Description of the Deluge wherein our Poet has visibly the Advantage The Sky's being over charged with Clouds the descending of the Rains the rising of the Seas and the appearance of the Rainbow are such Descriptions as every one must take Notice of The Circumstance relating to  Paradise  is so finely imagined and suitable to the Opinions of many learned Authors that I cannot forbear giving it a Place in this Paper  Then shall this mount  Of Paradise by might of waves be mov'd  Out of his place push'd by the horned stood  With all his verdure spoil'd and trees adrift  Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf  And there take root an Island salt and bare  The haunt of Seals and Orcs and SeaMews clang  THE Transition which the Poet makes from the Vision of the Deluge to the Concern it occasioned in  Adam  is exquisitely graceful and copied after  Virgil  though the first Thought it introduces is rather in the Spirit of  Ovid  How didst thou grieve then  Adam  to behold  The end of all thy Offspring end so sad  Depopulation thee another Floud  Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd  And sunk thee as thy Sons 'till gently rear'd  By th' Angel on thy feet thou stoodst at last  Though comfortless as when a Father mourns  His Children all in view destroy'd at once  I have been the more particular in my Quotations out of the Eleventh Book of  Paradise Lost  because it is not generally reckoned among the most shining Books of this Poem for which Reason the Reader might be apt to overlook those many Passages in it which deserve our Admiration The Eleventh and Twelfth are indeed built upon that single Circumstance of the Removal of our first Parents from  Paradise  but though this is not in it self so great a Subject as that in most of the foregoing Books it is extended and diversified with so many surprizing Incidents and pleasing Episodes that these two last Books can by no means be looked upon as unequal Parts of this Divine Poem I must further add that had not  Milton  represented our first Parents as driven out of  Paradise  his Fall of Man would not have been compleat and consequently his Action would have been imperfect  SPECTATOR N  o    Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures  Quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus  Hor  MILTON  after having represented in Vision the History of Mankind to the first great Period of Nature dispatches the remaining Part of it in Narration He has devised a very handsome Reason for the Angel's proceeding with  Adam  after this manner though doubtless the true Reason was the Difficulty which the Poet would have found to have shadowed out so mix'd and complicated a Story in visible Objects I could wish however that the Author had done it whatever Pains it might have cost him To give my Opinion freely I think that the exhibiting part of the History of Mankind in Vision and part in Narrative is as if an HistoryPainter should put in Colours one half of his Subject and write down the remaining part of it If  Milton  's Poem flags any where it is in this Narration where in some Places the Author has been so attentive to his Divinity that he has neglected his Poetry The Narration however rises very happily on several Occasions where the Subject is capable of Poetical Ornaments as particularly in the Confusion which he describes among the Builders of  Babel  and in his short Sketch of the Plagues of  Aegypt  The Storm of Hail and Fire with the Darkness that overspread the Land for three Days are described with great Strength The beautiful Passage which follows is raised upon noble Hints in Scripture  Thus with ten wounds  The RiverDragon tamed at length submits  To let his Sojourners depart and oft  Humbles his stubborn Heart but still as Ice  More harden'd after thaw till in his rage  Pursuing whom he late dismiss'd the Sea  Swallows him with his host but them lets pass  As on dry land between two Chrystal walls  Aw'd by the red of  Moses  so to stand  Divided  THE  RiverDragon  is an Allusion to the Crocodile which inhabits the  Nile  from whence  Aegypt  derives her Plenty This Allusion is taken from that sublime Passage in  Ezekiel Thus saith the Lord God behold I am against thee  Pharoah  King of  Egypt  the great Dragon that lieth in the midst of his Rivers which hath said My River is mine own and I have made it for my self Milton  has given us another very noble and poetical Image in the same Description which is copied almost Word for Word out of the History of  Moses  All night he will pursue but his approach  Darkness defends between till morning watch  Then thro' the fiery pillar and the cloud  God looking forth will trouble all his host  And craze their ChariotWheels  when by command  Moses  once more his potent rod extends  Over the Sea the Sea his Rod obeys  On their Embattell'd ranks the waves return  And overwhelm their War  AS the principal Design of this  Episode  was to give  Adam  an Idea of the Holy Person who was to reinstate Humane Nature in that Happiness and Perfection from which it had fallen the Poet confines himself to the Line of  Abraham  from whence the  Messiah  was to descend The Angel is described  as seeing the Patriarch actually travelling towards the  Land  of  Promise  which gives a particular Liveliness to this Part of the Narration  I see him but thou canst not with what Faith  He leaves his Gods his Friends his native Soil  Ur  of  Chaldaea  passing now the Ford  To  Haran  after him a cumbrous train  Of Herds and Flocks and numerous servitude  Not wand' ring poor but trusting all his wealth  With God who call'd him in a Land unknown  Canaan  he now attains I see his Tents  Pitcht about  Sechem  and the neighbouring Plain  Of  Moroh  there by promise he receives  Gift to his progeny of all that Land  From  Hamath  Northward to the desert South  Things by their names I call though yet unnamed  AS  Virgil  's Vision in the Sixth  Aeneid  probably gave  Milton  the Hint of this whole  Episode  the last Line is a Translation of that Verse where  Anchises  mentions the Names of Places which they were to bear hereafter  Hac tum nomina erunt nunc sunt sine nomine terrae  THE Poet has very finely represented the Joy and Gladness of Heart which rises in  Adam  upon his Discovery of the  Messiah  As he sees his Day at a Distance through Types and Shadows he rejoices in it but when he finds the Redemption of Man compleated and  Paradise  again renewed he breaks forth in Rapture and Transport  O goodness infinite goodness immense  That all this good of evil shall produce  c  I have hinted in my Sixth Paper on  Milton  that an Heroick Poem according to the Opinion of the best Criticks ought to end happily and leave the Mind of the Reader after having conducted it  through many Doubts and Fears Sorrows and Disquietudes in a state of Tranquility and Satisfaction  Milton  's Fable which had so many other Qualifications to recommend it was deficient in this Particular It is here therefore that the Poet has shewn a most exquisite Judgment as well as the finest Invention by finding out a Method to supply this natural Defect in his Subject Accordingly he leaves the Adversary of Mankind in the last View which he gives us of him under the lowest State of Mortification and Disappointment We see him chewing Ashes grovelling in the Dust and loaden with supernumerary Pains and Torments On the contrary our two first Parents are comforted by Dreams and Visions cheared with promises of Salvation and in a manner raised to a greater Happiness than that which they had forfeited In short  Satan  is represented miserable in the Height of his Triumphs and  Adam  triumphant in the Height of Misery  MILTON  's Poem ends very nobly The last Speeches of  Adam  and the ArchAngel are full of Moral and Instructive Sentiments The Sleep that fell upon  Eve  and the Effects it had in quieting the Disorders of her Mind produces the same kind of Consolation in the Reader who cannot peruse the last beautiful Speech which is ascribed to the Mother of Mankind without a secret Pleasure and Satisfaction  Whence thou return'st and whither went'st I know  For God is also in Sleep and Dreams advise  Which he hath sent propitious some great good  Presaging since with Sorrow and Heart's distress  Wearied I fell asleep but now lead on  In me is no delay with thee to go  Is to stay here without thee here to stay  Is to go hence unwilling thou to me  Art all things under Heav'n all Places thou  Who for my wilful Crime are banish'd hence  This farther Consolation yet secure  I carry hence though all by me is lost  Such Favour I unworthy am vouchsaf'd  By me the promised Seed shall all restore  THE following Lines which conclude the Poem rise in a most glorious Blaze of Poetical Images and Expressions  HELIODORƲS  in his  Aeshiopicks  acquaints us that the Motion of the Gods differs from that of Mortals as the former do not stir their Feet nor proceed Step by Step but slide o'er the Surface of the Earth by an uniform Swimming of the whole Body The Reader may observe with how Poetical a Description  Milton  has attributed the same kind of Motion to the Angels who were to take Possession of  Paradise  So spake our Mother  Eve  and  Adam  heard  Well pleas'd but answer'd not for now too nigh  Th' ArchAngel stood and from the other Hill  To their fix'd station all in bright array  The Cherubim descended on the Ground  Gliding meteorons as ev'ning mist  Ris'n from a River o'er the marish glides  And gathers ground fast at the lab'rer's heel  Homeward returning High in Front advanc'd  The brandish'd Sword of God before them blaz'd  Fierce as a Comet  THE Author helped his Invention in the following Passage by reflecting on the Behaviour of the Angel who in Holy Writ has the Conduct of  Lot  and his Family The Circumstances drawn from that Relation are very gracefully made use of on this Occasion  In either hand the hastning Angel caught  Our ling'ring Parents and to the Eastern gate  Led them direct and down the Cliff as fast  To the subjected plain then disappear'd  They looking back  c  THE Scene which our first Parents are surprized with upon their looking back on  Paradise  wonderfully strikes the Reader's Imagination as nothing can be more natural than the Tears they shed or that Occasion  They looking back all th' Eastern side beheld  Of  Paradise  so late their happy Seat  Wav'd over by the flaming brand the gate  With dreadful faces throng'd and fiery Arms  Some natural tears they dropp'd but wiped them soon  The world was all before them where to chuse  Their place of rest and Providence their Guide  IF I might presume to offer at the smallest Alteration in this Divine Work I should think the Poem would end better with the Passage here quoted than with the two Verses which follow  They hand in hand with wandering steps and slow  Through  Eden  took their solitary way  THESE two Verses though they have their Beauty fall very much below the foregoing Passage and renew in the Mind of the Reader that Anguish which was pretty well laid by that Consideration  The World was all before them where to chuse  Their place of rest and Providence their Guide  THE Number of Books in  Paradise Lost  is equal to those of the  Aeneid  Our Author in his First Edition had divided his Poem into Ten Books but afterwards broke the Seventh and the Eleventh  each of them into two different Books by the Help of some small Additions This second Division was made with great Judgment as any one may see who will be at the pains of examining it It was not done for the sake of such a Chimerical Beauty as that of resembling  Virgil  in this Particular but for the more just and regular Disposition of this great Work  THOSE who have read  Bossu  and many of the Criticks who have written since his Time will not pardon me if I do not find out the particular Moral which is inculcated in  Paradise Lost  Though I can by no means think with the lastmentioned  French  Author that an Epic Writer first of all pitches upon a certain Moral as the GroundWork and Foundation of his Poem and afterwards finds out a Story to it I am however of Opinion that no just Heroic Poem ever was or can be made from whence one great Moral may not be deduced That which reigns in  Milton  is the most universal and most useful that can be imagined it is in short this  that Obedience to the Will of God makes Men happy and that Disobedience makes them miserable  This is visibly the Moral of the principal Fable which turns upon  Adam  and  Eve  who continued in  Paradise  while they kept the Command that was given them and were driven out of it as soon as they had transgressed This is likewise the Moral of the principal Episode which shews us how an innumerable Multitude of Angels fell from their State of Bliss and were cast into Hell upon their Disobedience Besides this great Moral which may be looked upon as the Soul of the Fable there are an Infinity of Under Morals which are to be drawn from the several Parts of the Poem and which makes this Work more useful and instructive than any other Poem in any Language  THOSE who have Criticised on the  Odissey  the  Iliad  and  Aeneid  have taken a great deal of Pains to fix the Number of Months or Days contained in the Action of each of those Poems If any one thinks it worth his while to examine this Particular in  Milton  he will find that from  Adam  's first Appearance in the Fourth Book to his Expulsion from  Paradise  in the Twelfth the Author reckons ten Days As for that Part of the Action which is described in the three first Books as it does not pass within the Regions of Nature I have before observed that it is not subject to any Calculations of Time  I have now finished my Observations on a Work which does an Honour to the  English  Nation I have taken a general View of it under those four Heads the Fable the Characters the Sentiments and the Language and made each of them the Subject of a particular Paper I have in the next place spoken of the Censures which our Author may incur under each of these Heads which I have confined to two Papers though I might have enlarged the Number if I had been disposed to dwell on so ungrateful a Subject I believe however that the severest Reader will not find any little Fault in Heroic Poetry which this Author has fallen into that does not come under one of those Heads among which I have distributed his several Blemishes After having thus treated at large of  Paradise Lost  I could not think it sufficient to have celebrated this Poem in the whole without descending to Particulars I have therefore bestowed a Paper upon each Book and endeavoured not only to prove that the Poem is beautiful in general but to point out its particular Beauties and to determine wherein they consist I have endeavoured to shew how some Passages are beautiful by being Sublime others by being Soft others by being Natural which of them  are recommended by the Passion which by the Moral which by the Sentiment and which by the Expression I have likewise endeavoured to shew how the Genius of the Poet shines by a happy Invention a distant Allusion or a judicious Imitation how he has copied or improved  Homer  or  Virgil  and raised his own Imaginations by the Use which he has made of several Poetical Passages in Scripture I might have inserted also several Passages of  Tasso  which our Author has imitated but as I do not look upon  Tasso  to be a sufficient Voucher I would not perplex my Reader with such Quotations as might do more Honour to the  Italian  than the  English  Poet In short I have endeavoured to particularize those innumerable Kinds of Beauty which it would be tedious to recapitulate but which are essential to Poetry and which may be met with in the Works of this great Author Had I thought at my first engaging in this Design that it would have led me to so great a Length I believe I should never have entred upon it but the kind Reception which it has met with among those whose Judgments I have a Value for give me no Reason to repent of the pains I have been at in composing them  FINIS
