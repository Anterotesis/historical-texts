 Observations on the  Fifth Article of the Treaty of UNION  humbly offered to the Consideration of the Parliament relating to  Foreign Ships  THE Matter of Difficulty upon this Head I take to be as follows By the Article all Ships any of whose Owners were Foreigners at the Signing of the Treaty shall be Deem'd still Foreign Bottoms within the Terms of the Act of Navigation  The Reason of this is plain Most of the Shipping employ'd on the SouthEast of  Scotland  are Foreign Bottoms and severals of them own'd by Foreigners principally  Dutch  Now as  England  is very careful to Encourage her own Shipping and as  Britain  will after the Union still be so the Encrease Employment and Building of Ships being one of the Principal Foundations of her Wealth It would be hard to admit any Ships which are Foreign built to be free Ships in  Scotland  when none that are so in  England  can be admitted  England  freely admits all Ships built in  Scotland  to  be free in all the Ports and Trade of  Britain  Nay to go further  England  allows by the Union even  Dutch  Ships if bought by  Scots  Men and belonging to  Scots  Owners to be free which is more than any  Englishman  can be allow'd Nay If a Foreign built Ship lay now at  Leith  Road and her Owners were all  Englishmen  she would not be Deem'd a free Ship by the Union but the  English  Owners would loose the benefit of employing her and the Reason of this is to Encourage our own Shipping on which so much depends and this Benefit will be plainly  Scotland's  at last  But the Objection here is We have a great many Ships in our Trade that are Foreign built and that are chiefly own'd by  Scotsmen  but perhaps may have one or more Owners abroad and it would be hard that these  Scotsmen  should lose the Benefit of their Ships which they employ in the Trade of their Native Country only because they have some  Dutchmen  concerned with them when at the same time 'tis plain that if these  Dutchmen  were not concerned the Trade of  Scotland  would with great difficulty be carried on  The Expedient proposed for this as I meet with it is That a reasonable time should be given for the Subjects of  Scotland  to buy out their  Dutch  Owners or sell their own Interest  Or that it should have been said All Ships c whose Owners were  Scotsmen  at the End or Ratification of the Treaty c since till the Treaty is Concluded every  Scotsman  has a Right to employ any Ship whatever  To Answer this I crave leave to say That this tho plausible in its self has yet Inconveniencies of a nature Intolerable because by this any Man in  England  as well as in  Scotland  may in the name of  Scotsmen  Buy what number of Ships in  Holland  they please and at the end of the Union they become free Ships to the general Ruine of the Shipping in the whole Island  And this was Remarkably true to  England  's prodigious Loss when in the last  Dutch  War the Ships taken from  Holland  as Prize were made free the People bought  Dutch  Ships caused sham Privateers to take them and for several years some hundereds of them were Imployed in their Coal Trade to the Ruine of the Town of  Ipswick  where all the large Coal Ships used to be Built which Loss that Town never recovered  To give a time therefore to have all Ships Own'd by  Scotsmen  come in to be free is to open a Door to a Mischief which it cannot be desired  England  should suffer in Trade and the value now supposed to be Toucht here is but very small  All that I can see in this is That a  Medium  be found out which if it must be tho I do not grant that necessity neither  is this  That  at the time of the Treaty  the MAJOR PART of such Vessel did belong to the Subjects of  Scotland  I confess this seems to have some colour of Reason in it that the Majority should Denominate the whole and I would hope  England  would not Dispute it since they do not deny any Foreigners Holding or Owning any Share of an  English  Vessel but the Legitimacy of the Vessel consists in her Bottom  Now if the Majority of Owners as to the Value I mean were not  Scots  no Ship can be accounted Legitimate If a  Scots  Merchant Owns ⅜ of a Ship and a  Dutchman  ⅝ she cannot be accounted in Reason any thing but a  Dutch  Ship especially when her Bottom is  Dutch  too for the Denomination must go with the Major and it's not the  Dutch  Merchant is a part Owner of the  Scotsman  's Ship but the  Scotsman  is a part Owner of the  Dutchman  's Ship  This small  Medium  I think will reduce this Article to a Square and an Explanatorie Clause to that purpose will in two Lines determine that Point  All which is Humbly Remitted to the Consideration of the Right Honourable the Estates of Parliament
