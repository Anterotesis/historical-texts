to Letters in general cannot be unknown to your Royal Highness whose extensive Knowledge in all Parts of History would make it the highest Piece of Presumption in me to pretend to quote Authorities to shew what Alterations  the Study or Neglect of Letters have caused in the same People  Your Royal Highness's Goodness in being graciously pleased to accept the Dedication of the following Scenes shews not only how much your Royal Highness has at Heart the Advancement of Learning in general but of that Branch in particular whose End is to expose the Vices and ridicule the Follies of Mankind  I could have wish'd this first Attempt had been an Offering more worthy of the high Protection it receives from your Royal Highness's Name But Comedy tho' not the  noblest  Production of the Mind is not  the least  unuseful  and it is sufficient if there is a Tendency towards doing Good in any Work to make that Work appear deserving in your Royal Highness's Eye  This being the only Merit I pretend to I beg Leave as the most grateful Heart always  feels  more than it can  express  to be allow'd to return my most dutiful Acknowledgments by an  inward Consciousness  of that profound Truth Respect and Gratitude with which I am  SIR  Your Royal Highness's Most Obliged Most Dutiful and Most Devoted humble Servant W POPPLE  PREFACE TO THE READER  THE discontinuing the acting of a Play that has been well received by the Town in general at a Time when it might have gone on makes it necessary to give some Account of what has past since the first Night of its Representation and of the Motives that made the Author put a Stop to its Run  A Report having been maliciously raised and industriously spread all over the Town that the Play was a Party Play and supported by the Court and therefore to be opposed Numbers of Persons came into the House with an Intent as the Term is to damn it at all Events  Thus determin'd they took hold of every little Slip that  Aut Incuria fudit  Aut humana parum cavit Natura  and were very clamorous However the Play having had a fair Hearing went off with infinitely more  Applause  than  Blame  The Second Night the particular Things objected to being taken out the Play was acted from Beginning to End without one single Mark of Displeasure in the Audience  The Third Night it went off in the same Manner to the most numerous and splendid Audience that could be seen  The Fourth Night a Set of about eight or ten young Fellows went to the  Bedford  CoffeeHouse in the Piazza and declared publickly that they came purposely to damn the Play and would not leave the Playhouse till they had compassed their Ends The same Declaration they repeated when in the House to some Gentlemen that wero there  Friends but unknown to them to the Author  Accordingly Mr  Ryan  coming on to speak the  Prologue  they began their Uproar but were soon silenced and the  Prologue  was heard with Applause The Play beginning they began again and were so loud that Mr  Ryan  acquainted them that as he could not imagine there was any thing in the Play they could except against he was apprehensive he had the Misfortune to displease them Mr  Quin  then came on and told them he found the House was divided and as the Majority was for hearing the Play he hop'd those who were not would go out The House on that were unanimous and cry'd  Turn them out Turn them out  but they saved the Audience the Trouble of doing it and retired under the general Hiss of every Person then present After which the Play went on without the least Disturbance  The Author having reflected that Malice tho' it could do the Play no Hurt might affect Mr  Rich  by keeping Persons  from the House who have no great Relish for Noise chose rather to discontinue the further acting of the Play and to refer himself to the Judgment of every impartial Reader to whom he freely commits it being determin'd as frankly to acknowledge any real Fault found with it as to justify it if censur'd without Reason  The Author cannot conclude without declaring how much he thinks himself obliged to every Actor for the Care taken in the acting it and more particularly to those who having the principal Parts to perform had an Opportunity to exert themselves as they did in the most satisfactory Manner  PROLOGUE  By AARON HILL  Esq  WHEN Love's taught Dangers animate the Stage  Your Ears ye Fair let the soft Scenes engage  Let each bright List'ner mark the Wiles we show  And catch dumb Caution from the pictur'd Woe  Guiltless of Farce to Night the meaning Player  Courts not your Laughterbut alarms your Care  Man the Deceiver veils his cruel Art  And skreens himself within th' attempted Heart  There to ungenerous Empire climbs ere long  Help'd by the Confidence he means to wrong  This to detect we act his Falshood o'er  And the Deluder known betrays no more  Such the best Business of the Comick Muse  Love has a thousand Lessons to infuse  Not always Lightness shou'd ungrace the Scene  To laugh at Folly but indulges Spleen  Coxcombs and Fops in harmless Error stray  And trip undangerous out of Passion's Way  Misers and Sots less Mirth than Pity move  And Dullness brings an Antidote for Love  But there's a Traitor arm'd in am'rous Mail  Born to attempt and fashion'd to prevail  Disguis'd in Softnessby deep Arts endear'd  And always dang'rousbecause never fear'd  Him in our Glass of Life to Night we show  Nor stoop the condescending Scene too low  Hence if too grave for Comedy we seem  Think us but suited to our serious Theme  'Tis no light Loss when charming Woman falls  On our Defence the Sex's Merit calls  We who the Pictures of a World impart  Neglect not what concerns its fairest Part  All Danger to that Sex thus frankly shown  At the same Time does Honour to our own  Nor let Neglect of Laughter move the Pit  To dread in Consequence a Dearth of Wit  Unmeaning  Mirth  may live in empty Noise  But solid  Converse  swells our softer Joys  Once in an Age of Tumbling Dance and Song  Suppose not two short Hours of Sense too long  Not even the Fashion  Change  of  Taste  denies  Oft MERRY herelet us be sometimesWISE  EPILOGUE  By AARON HILL  Esq  BAulk'd as I ammy Heart's best Hope miscarried  Try'd cast and sentenc'd to be hang'dthat's married  Ere I'm turn'd off I think it but my Duty  To warn in my last Speech fastfalling Beauty  First  Maidens  let my sad Example teach ye  To put no Trust in Man'till he can reach ye  For shou'd you strive too near his Strength so mighty  That down you come at onceand thenGood Night t'ye  Next O ye  Wives  trust not in Beauty's Merit  But to your Body's Influence add your Spirit  With your Eye's Lightning mix a Tongue that thunders  Believe meLove so doublearm'd works Wonders  Yet if nor Charms nor Eloquence can save ye  But your good Man will break the Faith he gave ye  Be you beforehand with himThat Reproving  Will make him own there's Guilt in too light loving  And for you  Widows  you're too wise sor teaching  But suff'ring Malefactors must be preaching  So take one Word of Council in your Calling  Tho' you're too brave I know to fear a Falling  From your old Yoke set free admit no new one  Unless with some poor brisk young kind and true one  The conscious Youth long mindful of your Favour  Will make up all Defects with good Behaviour  Loth that his Wants his Gratitude shou'd smother  What he can't bring you one Waycomes another  And now good People what I've more to say t'ye  Shou'd be a doleful  Tune  and  sigh  and  pray  t'ye  But doleful Tunes of late are grown so common  They move more Sorrow than a dying Woman  And Sighs and Prayers are best when made in private  As you all know who have good Ends to drive at  What shall I do thenshall I hang and tarry  Or bold in saving Faith go on and marry  'Tis both Ways badBut I've at once bethought me  Of a sweet Lesson dear Revenge has taught me  I'll stay and see Sir  Harry  in his Fetters  Nor be so rude to swing before my Betters  Pass but his Honeymoon of Sunshine Weather  And He and I may then go hang together  EPILOGUE  Sent by an unknown Hand the Third and Fourth Night  Spoken by Mrs YOUNGER  WHAT odd Conclusions senseless Poets

Life dost thou fill up  Pauses and sips Tea  What a subjected Thing is ManHow soon he changes A Breath of Wind too hot or cold an illdigested Meal a Wish unsatisfy'd in a Moment shall destroy this happy Turn of MindAnd thenthe Morn no  longer lovely the Prospect dulltasteless the AirIf it was not for dear Woman  Enter  Tom  Tom  Sir Mr  Heartly  is come to Town and desires to know when he may wait on you  Sir Har  Ha  Heartly  come to Town I am glad on't Here  Tom  my Service and tell him the sooner he comes the betterAn honest Fellow this  Heartly  but a little too scrupulous He denies himself the Pleasures of Life from a Notion that unless the Law has prescrib'd the Manner of using them they ought not to be enjoy'd  Enter  Laetitia  Laet  Good Morrow Brother I want some Discourse with you But you are so eternally taken up there's not an Hour free to give Audience to a Sister I come to talk with you about your Behaviour of late  Sir Har  Pr'ythee  Laetitia  don't affect Gravity It becomes you as ill  Laet  As it does you But this is an Affair that requires a serious Answer which I desire therefore you'll give me What do you mean by your Addresses to  Angelina  Do you really love her or is it mere Gallantry  Sir Har  Before I give you a serious Answer I must desire to know the Reason of your asking  Laet  I won't tell him  Angelina  has discover'd her Passion for him to me that would be unfair nor shou'd I like to be serv'd so myself  aside  Nay nothing but Curiosity You seem of late contrary to your usual Custom to be very particular to her among other Ladies and I own I love her so that I cou'd wish our Friendship were cemented yet closer That's all  Sir Har  Well Sister to deal frankly with you as much as I can love I love  Angelina  She has Youth Beauty good Sense and Fortune but so have a thousand other Women Now whether these will always please in  Angelina  as much as they do now or whether I shall not want to try if these Perfections will not please more in other WomenGad I can't tellI'm of such a fluctuating Temper I can't answer for myself longAt present I own I see her with a Lover's Eye  Laet  Well that's enough for me 'Tis  Angelina  's Business to keep you constant when once she gets you  Sir Har  I hope then you're satisfy'd And now Sister give me Leave in my Turn to question youBut first I must tell you  Heartly  is come to Town  Laet  aside  What does he meanBrother I can't stay now Some other Time I must dress myself to meet  Angelina  We are to go to the Auction together  Sir Har  Nay I shan't keep you long I've only one Question to ask you  Enter  Tom  Tom  Sir Mr  Heartly  's below  Sir Har  Shew him up  Exit  Tom  Laet  Let me be gone I would not for the World he should see me thus  Sir Har  Methinks you're well enough dress'd  Laet  O fye how can you say so  Sir Har  Ah  Laetitia  this Delicacy discovers what you wou'd conceal  Laet  I don't care what it discovers so I get away O Lud I hear him coming I won't stay one Moment  Exit  Enter  Heartly  Sir Har  My dearest  Heartly  I am overjoy'd to see you  Hear  I do assure you Sir  Harry  I thought the Time long on many Accounts But will you forgive me an abrupt Question Was not that your Sister that left you as I came up I got a Glimpse as she shot along and thought it was that dear Figure whose Resemblance still fresh in my Memory during my Retirement ever kept me Company  Sir Har  It was indeed But she was not well dress'd enough she wanted a Pin or a Patch I suppose or some such important Matter A foolish Maxim in the Sex  Ned  always to appear to the best Advantage before Marriage It makes the Difference but too sensible after when we see and feel the Neglect  Hear  The Reason of her going was however kind But tell me Sir  Harry  are you a little more reconcil'd to old  England  than you was when we last parted Have our pretty Countrywomen made any Impression on your Heart  Sir Har  My Heart  Ned  was ever soft and will like Wax as easily take as lose an Impression But I'm such a Convert to my Countrywomen's Charms that I think they want nothing but a little more Gaiety and Life to make them as much more agreeable as they are already more beautiful than those of other Nations  Hear  This is something I am pleas'd to see you can do Justice to your own Country  Sir Har  Pr'ythee dear  Ned  for once lay aside thy Partiality to thy own Country Look upon thyself as a Foreigner That done observe our charming Countrywomen at a Visit or a Play see how they sit with their Hands rivetted to their  Fans and plac'd just in the Centre of their pretty Persons motionless unless it be to display the Furbelows of that little Engine and as silent  Hear  You are the first that ever complain'd of that  Sir Har  I'd have 'em speak in every Gesture Give me a Woman whose very Air and Manner speak and are a tacit Confession that they have  Hear  Havewhat  Sir Har  What Why as much Inclination as Power to charm  Hear  And have you found none such How did Sir  Peregrine  's Lady prove I think I left you hot in that charitable Pursuit I don't expect to find you so now  Sir Har  Why faith  Ned  it wou'd be odd if you did A beautiful Woman is like a wellwrote Book every Leaf you turn over at first affords new Pleasure but when you're forc'd to read it daily from one End to the other you'll find but little Inclination to begin again  Hear  You're witty Sir But is this Argument only to hold good for the Men Have not Women the same Plea for Inconstancy  Sir Har  Ah Friend That it was but so How happy should we be But there's a Fatality in the Way of loving of the two Sexes that renders both miserable Enjoyment lessens our Passion and increases theirs  Hear  Then you was successful And now like a restless Tyrant despise your Conquest and seek for new Acquisitions  Sir Har  Successful Ay that I was to tell you a Secret long before honest Sir  Peregrine  took a Bargain off my Hands that began to puzzle me a little how to dispose of  Hear  How Sir  Harry  Sir Har  In few Words then thus Lady  Traffick  then  Lucia Bellfast  old Colonel  Bellfast  's Daughter was very pretty I very amorous Our Neighbourhood gave me many Opportunities of seeing her which I improv'd till at last I found myself tenderly beloved I caught the Infection too and doated on her promised Marriage which I intended to execute The Saints in Heaven and her Maid were Witnesses to my Vows  Lucia  thought the Security good and delivered into my Arms the loveliest Person they had ever held With Joy we often met and with Reluctance parted cursing the Day that came so soon and oblig'd me to disappear before any of the Family was up but the trusty Maid Much about this Time Sir  Peregrine  came down to  Lucia  's Father fell in Love with the Daughter ask'd her of him and obtain'd her She wou'd have declar'd our Affair to avoid a Match she hated and to have been mine as I had promis'd but having no great Stomach to the Match and finding she wou'd not suffer in her Reputation by the Affair I advis'd her to accept the Gentleman's Offer in such a Manner that she saw she must or be undone I own 'twas unkindShe did not see me for a long Time after she was married and I believe never wou'd had not her Husband's Affairs call'd him abroad  Hear  And so not content with forcing this fond Creature to give her Vows to a Man she hated you forc'd her too to violate those very Vows and  Sir Har  Hold  Ned  not so fast I did all I cou'd indeed but she was obstinate and never wou'd It was in vain to alledge former Intimacies she wept and answer'd me with her Husband her Husband at ever Word Is it not odd  Ned  a Woman shou'd be constant to a Man she hates and refuse one she loves  Hear  It may seem so to you But People that think there is something beside Passion that ought to be listen'd to may perhaps be of a different Opinion But now you mention her Husband pray what's become of him  Sir Har  Gone  Hear  Gone What do you mean Sir  Sir Har  Why goneGone to Heaven Man  Hear  What dead  Sir Har  Ay SirAnd the generous goodnatur'd Creature left his Widow all he had If he had not it would have been a heavy Tax on me  Hear  'Twas generous indeed I heard he was a worthy Man  Sir Har  Yes faith too worthy to make a Cuckold of  Hear  Pr'ythee be serious  Sir Har  Why then in few Wordsher Husband Sir  Peregrine  's private Affairs oblig'd him to go to  Leghorn  These very private Affairs oblig'd him to leave that Place soon after and make a short Voyage Short indeed it was for the Ship and Crew were all cast away on the Coast of  Barbary  near  Sallee  Like a prudent Man he had made his Will before he went and thus my Lady  Traffick  became a young and rich Widow Now  Ned  you know a Woman can't hold out for ever against a Man she loves Her Husband's Death left her without any Excuse and her own Heart pleaded strongly for me Then she hop'd too to make me more than ever fond and like a fond Fool marry her She took the wrong MethodHowever our Commerce which now I am very sorry for was renewed again again she trusted me and was again deceiv'd  Hear  So soon cool  Sir Har  I should be tir'd of an Angel unless she cou'd vary her Form Like  Ovid  I'm for the  black the fair the plump the lean the tall the short All allTo be plain I never saw a Woman but had something pleasing in her  Hear  Still wild and inconstant  Sir Har  Ay faith And when I grow otherwise it must be for a very bad Reason Why Sir to shew you what a Man of Business I am I have at present an honourable Affair upon my Hands which does not hinder me from amusing myself with my Mistress's Woman  Hear  Thou art a bold Lover faith  Sir Har  Psha psha Women don't like one the worse for that  Hear  But who is it that has kindled this honourable Flame in your Breast  Sir Har  One that might warm a Hermit's frozen Breast  Angelina  Hear  My Lord  Lovewell  's Daughter I think she's an only Child She must be rich  Sir Har  Ay Sir she wants for nothing Then Sir I have which with all my Soul I wish I had not this Lady  Traffick  as troublesome as a Dun when a Man has nothing to payBut this does not hinder me from laying close Siege to another who is on the Point of dropping into my Arms Young and pretty as an Angel  Hear  But can this Angel vary her Form  Sir Har  Time enough for that yet She's a Virgin O  Ned  there's something so charming in the first Struggles of a young and yielding HeartWe quarrelled last Night which I am confident will advance my Affair more than the most favourable Opportunity wou'd  Hear  Well Sir you are an Adept in the Mystery of Love For my Part I have but one Heart and find one Mistress fills it quite up Your Sister Sir  Harry  holds me at full Play I came to Town once more in order to try my Fate  Sir Har  I wish you Success with all my Heart  Enter  Tom  Tom  Sir  Lively  Sir come to wait on you  Sir Har  Cou'd the Coxcomb take no other Time I wou'd enjoy thy Company now Well shew him up Do you know him  Heartly  Hear  I had some small Acquaintance with him before he went abroad  Sir Har  A travell'd Coxcomb with great good Nature and very little Sense by which you may judge of the Improvement he has made A Scrap of a  French  Song and a Coupee after  Marcels  sum up his whole Character Oh here he is  Enter Sir  Lively  singing  Sir Lively  Vive le Printems  Il rend le Coeur gay  Le Mois des Amans  C'est le Mois de May  Good Morrow Knight Mr  Heartly  This Rencontre is indeed fortunate Sir I am totally yoursHey what's the Matter Sir  Harry  you look out of Sorts discompos'd or as one might say Piqué  Sir Har  Piqué  Sir Liv  Ay piqué Why I own I was a little severe upon you last Night before your Mistress nay and with her too  Angelina  and I jok'd away Ah Knight 'Tis a witty Rogue  Sir Har  Ay Sir so it seems by the Choice she made of you to be witty with  Hear  'T was prudently done She'd a Mind to have all the Wit to herself  Sir Liv  Prettily said Now by this Light tho' he calls one Fool I can't be angry with him  aside  Heartly  thou hast Wit too Well I think  there are not three prettier Fellows in  England  Pr'ythee let's from a Triumvirate together and proscribe I love proscribing dearly We'll banish all Coxcombs out of the Mall  Hear  Not all Sir  Lively  Sir Liv  Thou shalt save a Friend or so All else  Hear  And the Women What will you do with them Sir  Lively  Sir Liv  Sir  Harry  shall take Care of them He has made the Sex his Study He is a great Connoisseur that Way He knows a Whore from a modest Woman by her Looks only Now I am not so deep learn'd for I think there's nothing so like a modest Woman as a Whore and I am very apt to mistake one for t'other  Sir Har  'Twas a curs'd Mistake Sir  Lively  you made at  Paris  Sir Liv  Mum for that dear Knight spare your Friend  Aside  Hear  Nay no whispering Sir Come come what was that Mistake Sir  Harry  Sir Har  Psha a mere Trifle A Lady of Quality in  France  that was deeply in Love with Sir  Lively  desir'd him to walk thro'a Common Sewer at Midnight in order to skreen him from the Fury of an incens'd Husband who unluckily returning from  Versailles  had like to have surpriz'd him  dans la Ruelle de Madam  Hear  'Twas unlucky indeed But I hope Sir  Lively  you had been beforehand with him and hahaha Rogue  Sir Liv  Why faith  Ned  she was kind 'Twas a dear Wench split me  Sir Har  The Knight says true What with the Loss of his Cloaths and Purse and Surgeon's Bill I believe it might have cost him aboutlet me seeHow many hundred Livres was it Sir  Lively  Sir Liv  S'life he'll tell all and I shall lose my Reputation with  Heartly  Her Husband was a damn'd Debauchée a Man of Quality A Wife that has such a Husband you know is never safe Faith she made me weep to see the Concern she was under on my Account She never minded herself not she  Sir Har  That I dare swear She was too wel season'd  Sir Liv  Well well you will have your Jest Nay I can bear a Jest from a Friend Sir  Harry  where do you dine to Day  Sir Har  Come come that sha'nt save you  Heartly  shall know all This Lady's Husband this Man of Quality this damn'd Debauchée  Sir Liv  Pox on him I shall be quite undone quite ruin'd  Sir Har  Appeared in the  Tuilleries  the next Day in the very Suit this jilting Whore this Lady of Quality I mean had robb'd Sir  Lively  of and was mistaken for him by all the  English  of his Acquaintance  Hear  How's this Sir  Lively  Sir Liv  False by this Light Sir  Harry  's a  Railleur  and is angry with me because I'm better with  Angelina  than he But I'll be even with him I know what I know Are you for a Turn in the Park this Morning Gentlemen  Hear  I would with all my Heart But Sir  Harry  and I have some little Business  Sir Liv  Your Pardon for having been thus long troublesome We shall meet anon at  Angelina  's Sir  Harry  I intend to dine there I am welcome at all Hours I receive vast Encouragement from her But I won't teize you longer AdieuNay you sha'nt stir  Sir Har  I'll but wait on you to the Door  Sir Liv  Not a Stepby my Soul's soft PassionAdieu my Dears  Exit  Sir Har  At length we have shook off this Coxcomb But he has staid so long I have not Time to enjoy thy Company now I must to Lady  Traffick  's who keeps me to as strict Attendance as if 'fore Gad I was her Husband  Hear  And pray Sir  Harry  how d'you intend to dispose of this Lady  Sir Har  Why faith  Ned  I am a little puzzled as to that I have not Illnature enough to forsake her nor Complaisance enough to forsake my Pleasures for her She knows my Love is at its lowest Ebb and that there is little left but Gratitude to keep it alive And since that Time what have I not suffer'd To give you a Sketch of my Life with her Each Day I see her and each Day am regularly entertain'd with the same ReproachesI hear myself accus'd as Author of her Ruin my own Words Words which at certain Moments in my first Passion's Heat or when compell'd by the fond Question  Do you love and will you ever love me  Words which indeed I may have said quoted back and retorted as so many Proofs of my Inconstancy In short my Temper's quite broke quite wearied out with struggling Neither Company nor Friends divert me Were I to consult her Humour I should never be from her When I but miss a Day there's no End of her upbraiding A Recapitulation of all that has pass'd from the first Moment of our Acquaintance as surely follows as such Recapitulation is follow'd by Tears Threats Passion Hope Despair each in their Turn  Hear  But I think you mention'd a Promise of Marriage Her Husband's Death leaves that Promise still open and renews the Justice of her Claim  Sir Har  You would advise me then to marry my  Hear  I know your MeaningyourGive me Leave to ask you one serious Question  Sir Har  Let it be a short one  Hear  Does your Conscience never reproach you  Sir Har  Hold Friend If you love me touch not that String It founds harsh I myself avoid to touch it  Hear  I've done Time and your own good Sense will make you reflect  Sir Har  Ay ay Time's the best Remedy for Distempers of this kind Age and Impotence is your only Specific for an Amorous Constitution But I must leave you now Friend It will be Evening before I can see you Till then adieu At  Angelina's  Hear  I'll meet you Adieu Sir  Harry

some time or other alter this wild Way of thinking and find more Pleasure in the Conversation of one Man of Sense  Laet  Pr'ythee  Angelina  don't be so very wise I tell you the solemn Talk of one Man

Time on't if they come together I'm sure he likes me and there is a secret Pleasure in rivalling one's Mistress When my Lady's out of Humour and scolds  Betty  my Master behind her Back caresses  Betty  and comforts her with kind Words and something else Oh the Sweets of such Revenge Wou'd she'd scold me every Day Well I think a Lady's Woman that's great with her Master is the happiest

Inclination does not lead us Can I remember with what Eagerness he us'd to fly to see me and can I bear his Slowness now Oh Love fantastic Deity or rather impotent and weak Thou yield'st to every different Temper and appear'st not what thou art in thy true Nature but what Man's various Humour makes thee When first our Bosoms  take thee in thou seem'st indeed what flattering Poets call thee gay smiling full of Tenderness and Truth We promise ourselves thou art a Deity indeed and as a Deity immortal and unchangeable but soon too soon alas thou sicken'st the pleasing Warmth decays Possession thy proper Food that which should nourish thee kills thee  Pauses and looks out impatiently  Not yet come What can stay himWhatThe first fair Face he meets And yet he knows that I expect him knows too that I'm distracted when he outstays his Time or disappoints me  Knocking without  Ha is not that he It is Now cannot I forbear to tell him how impatient I have been tho' I know it will draw on some angry Words  Enter Sir  Harry  You would be sorry Sir  Harry  to come a Moment before your Time  In a kind Tone of Voice  Sir Har  So sits the Wind thusAnd you Madam to lose an Opportunity of making me some Reproach  Lady Traf  The Reproach is rather kind than disobligingAnother wou'd be pleas'd to be so reproach'd  Soft  Sir Har  Perhaps so  Lady Traf  Perhaps so Nay 'tis so Fye fye can you be angry that I long to see you  Soft  Sir Har  No MadamNow shall I be persecuted with so much Fondness that my Temper will never bear it and I shall fly out  Aside  Lady Traf  That I bear your Absence with Pain and that I wish to pass each Moment of my Life with you I know it is a foolish Wish But I must make it tho' I know it shou'd offend you and yet I am miserable when you are displeas'd  Sir Har  Why all this Tenderness for me Unhappy  Lucia  wou'd I cou'd love thee as thou deserv'st  Aside  Lady Traf  Whence this Silence You seem uneasy Shall I not share your Pain  Sir Har  Uneasy Madam  Lady Traf  Why do you echo thus my Words and with such cold Formality Uneasy Madam Have I no other Name no softer Appellation There was a Time I hadThen 'twas dearest  Lucia  my Life kind  Lucia  Such Words and such a Tone of Voicean Angel wou'd have fallen  Turns her Head aside and holds her Handkerchief to her Eyes  Sir Har  She weepsNay give not Way to such a Weakness You hurt yourself In what am I chang'd Have I not still the same Regard I ever had Is there a Person I esteem like you  Lady Traf  Regard Esteem And is that all Is there no Love left  angrily  Keep your Regard and your Esteem and give 'em to your Friends  softly  your Mistress ought to share your softer Sentiments And I have quitted all to share those softer Sentiments and would were it to do againWill you then rob me of the Price of such a Sacrifice and pay me with Regard Esteem  Sir Har  You still misconstrue what I said Can there be Love without Esteem without Regard We differ but in Words  Lady Traf  And why not call it Love Is there any thing frightful in the Word  Sir Har  Well call it Love How weak you Women are Each idle Fancy swells into a Truth with you when some one pettish Humour which you have is pleas'd to shew itself Let a Man act with the most strict Regard to all the Ties of  Honour and Conscience fails he but in one little trifling exterior Mark of Tenderness when perhaps he is of a Temper not apt to be fond 'tis as if he had done nothing No Regard is had for what he does The little he omits has only Power to make Impression on your Minds 'Tis such a WeaknessOne of your Sense  Lucia  should be above those little Follies of your Sex  Lady Traf  Had you not us'd me to those little Follies of my Sex as you call them to those trifling Marks of Tenderness I had ne'er expected 'em nor felt the Want of 'em now But when I think on what you once was  Sir Har  There 'tis again If a Man once fool's away an idle Hour in soft Caresses and fond Blandishments in the Beginning of an Amour or when the Blood boils high he must be ever after toying ever sooling or there is no Quiet for him and he must expect to be baited and reproach'd as I am  Lady Traf  False and scandalous Accusation made only to colour your violated Faith and Breach of Truth You accuse us only when you know yourselves are false Because we love with greater Truth and that our Passions grow while yours decrease and lessen by Possession you cry out with a saucy Insolence and Shew of Wisdom Must we be for ever toying ever fooling As if those little Marks of Fondness and Affection that Lovers give and take were a Disgrace to your superior Natures and a Weakness scarce tolerable in ours Curse on your false dissembling Arts You can employ those little Marks of Fondness and Affection you can fool and toy away not Hours but Days and Months when you'd inspire us with a Passion for you How well you act when you'd seduce us You are more fond and foolish even than we or seem so the better to deceive us You fawn like Spaniels and lick the Foot  that spurns you Whilst we pleas'd with a Shew of Tenderness that flatters our Weakness suspect no Guile receive you as welcome Guests and cherish you with still encreasing Love  Sir Har  Proceed Madam I hear you  Lady Traf  Your Empire settled o'er us you shew yourselves First you begin to languish and grow tir'd in our Company you want Diversion to relieve your Minds As we love you with unfeign'd Affection and prefer your Pleasures to our own we bear your Absence in that View with Satisfaction That Point gain'd you go on farther A Coolness succeeds Our Beauties fade in your Eyes want Edge for your pall'd Appetites Faintly you deny it and to excuse yourselves you tell us Love's a Passion that ought not to make the Business but the Amusement of Life and shou'd be never suffer'd to grow serious  Sir Har  Pray Madam go on  Lady Traf  Our Minds affected by such new and unknown Doctrine we reproach you Our Reproaches arm'd with Truth perplex and gaul you and at last beget Aversion in you which once born never dies Your Aversion draws new Reproaches from us and our Reproaches strengthen your Aversion 'till at last Love long since fled Pity forsakes you too You leave the miserable Wretch you made so to Sorrow and Repentance to dearbought Experience Guilt and Shame unable to conquer her Passion and condemn'd never to have it repaid  Sir Har  What a deal of Truth she utters That so much Sense and such Experience should not be able to get the better of her Passion  aside  Well  Lucia  is there any thing more I'm attentive  Lady Traf  No I've done Perhaps I've said too much I know such Plaindealing is odious to  you and banishes you henceI'm more concern'd at the cool Blood with which he has heard me than at the Heat he us'd to shew  aside  Perhaps you're offended Come you must forgive me 'Tis much against my Will but I am as full of Weakness as of Love and merit more your Pity than your Anger  Enter  Jenny  Jen  Madam Dinner waits you  Lady Traf  Come Sir  Harry  Exit  Sir Har  I'll follow you What can I do Go on in this uncomfortable Way ImpossibleI'm now so us'd to her Person she moves me no more than if I had lost my Faculties And yet to an impartial Eye she has all that Man can wish in Form and outward Shew The Fault's not on my Side neither if I can't taste her Beauties 'tis no Defect of Appetite a coarser Meal goes downA pretty Wench this How long hast thou been here Child  Jen  But this Morning Sir  Sir Har  Now am I mad for this Wench and every Wench I see What strange Stuff am I made of  Aside  Jen  The Gentleman talks to himself sure he's mad I'll in and tell my Lady  Exit  Sir Har  This Wench runs strangely in my Mind I must talk to her a little  Turning about before he is quite turned he says these Words as to the Maid  Enter Lady  Traffick  And so Child you came hither but this Morning  Lady Traf  No Sir But my Lady says she'll turn me away before Night for fear you should ruin me as you've done her  Sir Har  starts  Ha  Lucia  You see Child I was talking to your Maid I love to see human Nature in all its Shapes You know my Humour  Lady Traf  I'm not to learn it now But come Sir  Harry  let's go in to Dinner Nay I'll not trust you you're such a Rover you must be kept within Sight  When once the Heart its native Home forsakes  And a new Mistress the Possession takes  In vain we'd call the little Wanderer back  Like Stars once shot it leaves no certain Track  END of the SECOND ACT  ACT III  Sir  Harry  and Lady  Traffick  rising from Table  Sir Har  YOu've entertain'd me nobly  Lucia  you grow prodigal  Lady Traf  To whom then should I lavish what I have but you Can I too well receive you What is there I would not sacrifice for you I'd part even with Life cou'd it procure a Moment's Pleasure to you or remove a Moment's Pain  Sir Har  Nay that wou'd be too much I am not so voluptuous tho' you often reproach me with my Pleasures nor so afraid of Pain as to purchase one or avoid the other at so dear a Price  Lady Traf  Well I cou'd give it tho' But come Sir  Harry  I know you love a Song and I am always happy when I can give you any Satisfaction My Maid shall entertain you with one She has both Taste and Voice  Jenny  sings  Ungrateful Youth whom still  Inspite of all I love  In vain you use me ill  My Grief not Hate you move  Love's Dart  Forc'd from the Heart  Behind it leaves unending Smart  Then gentler Means employ  Hardhearted cruel Boy  Or give me leave  To love and grieve  And with false Hopes my Pains deceive  For Hope alone can ease  A Heart that can no longer please  Sir Har  I need not ask whose Words these are  Sir  Harry  looks at his Watch then says aside  The Time of my Appointment's come  Lady Traf  So soon  Sir Har  Did not I tell you I must leave you soon  Lady Traf  Yes But I did not think 'twou'd have been quite so soon  Sir Har  Something of Consequence I can't neglect obliges me to go  Heartly

Sir Har  I must  Lady Traf  You shallbutcan't you stay a little longer  Sir Har  I understand her well but have another newer Call at present  aside  For what That Time gone you'll still ask more and more I know you you'll be as unwilling in an Hour to let me go as you are now You are too kind  Lady Traf  No by Heaven Stay but a little longer and I will let you go  Sir Har  I cannot stay one Moment now but I'll return this Evening Upon my Honour I will  Lady Traf  Well go then Yet I cou'd wish you wou'd stay Something within me tells me I'm ruin'd lost for ever if you go  Sir Har  Fye

I going and for what To take Advantage of a Weakness which a young and innocent Creature has for me To rob her of the Calm she now enjoys and fill her Breast with Tumult and Disorder To make those Eyes ere long o'erflow with Tears that us'd to smile in Innocence and all to gratify a brutal Appetite which I could gratify another Way and without Prejudice to her Why what a Villain am I No sooner will she have given up her last and dearest Stake but she will give a Loose to all those warm Desires that yet lie smother'd in her Breast Desire fed grows strong and violent No Tie no Restraint then WarmtenderfondHa The Thought transports me To see the first hard Struggles 'twixt Modesty and Love To see her trembling with Desire afraid to shew it and yet shewing it thro' all By Heaven there's not a Joy in Life that equals such a Scene But then the following Scene To see her drown'd in Tears regretting what she has done Hiding her Eyes not daring to look up and conscious that she's not what she was yet charm'd with what she is for Love will conquer I will not think on't Futurity must answer  for itself the present Time must be pass'd away The Scene of Life must shift or we sleep but  Enter Maid  Maid  Sir there's a Lady within that desires to speak with you  Sir Har  I come Well these are the most convenient Houses a Man cou'd wish to have The Thoughts of a private House has brought

you will be so rashBut under what Pretence can we go to this House Sir  Lively  Sir Liv  Why Madam 'tis only asking Mrs  Laetitia  to go with you to Mrs  Darnwell  's to see some Lace For the rest you must trust to Chance  Ang  Mrs  Darnwell  's She's my Milliner  Sir Liv  Lucky beyond Expectation Why you may question her the more easily and with the less Suspicion  Ang  Nay that wou'd seem too curious in me as it is but to rally that Indifference he affects that I should desire to catch him there too particular an Inquiry wou'd make him think oddly of me  Sir Liv  Catch him there I cou'd give you five hundred Instances of it Why Madam I've known him been oblig'd to jump out of a Window five Stories high at  Paris  on an unexpected Return of a Husband or Lover  Ang  Five Stories high

mean the Recompence for his Sufferings Nothing less than the Joys of Paradise  Laet  Come my Dear  interrupting  let's go or I shall be turn'd into a Paradise in an Instant and be claim'd by him as a Reward for his SufferingsIs it not soNay don't answer me for I won't hear it  Ang  Come Mr  Heartly  you shall answer her as we go along  Hear  Mrs  Darnwell  's Ha is not that a House Sir  Harry  makes Use of on particular Occasions That Rogue Sir  Lively  has been prating he mutter'd something this Morning of what he knew Hark'ee Sir  Lively  prevent their going or by Heaven I'll cut your Throat  Sir Liv  I prevent it How can Iprevent itNo no I know a Trick worth two of that  Hear  Well Sir you may repent it tho'  Sir Liv  All's one for that  Ned  Ang  What say you Mr  Heartly  Hear

 Darnwell  's  Enter  Tom  and  Betty  Tom  I tell you Child my Master is engag'd and you positively cannot see him  Bet  And I tell you Sir that if your Master was ten times more engag'd I must and will see him But pray Sir how long have you and I been so well acquainted  Pulls him by the Sleeve  Child is a pretty familiar Expression You use no Ceremony I see with your Betters  Tom  Betters What does the Baggage mean Because my Master does her the Honour to take a little Notice of her she thinks herself exalted a Degree above one of her own RankBetters Mrs  Betty  Why I don't know but methinks there's no such great Difference between us I'm Valet to a very fine Gentleman and Inheritor of all his Vices you WaitingWoman to a very fine Lady and Possessor in full of all her Follies and Affectations So that as our Rank in Life is equal and our Qualifications pretty much the same I own I want Eyes to see the wide Difference you wou'd put between us  Bet  The Fellow says true A good genteel  Person But then he's a Footman Foh how rank that smells A Girl that has once tasted of Gentility can never sink down to the mottly Tribe at least it ought to be the last Stake she playsWell Sir will you be pleas'd to tell your Master I have something to communicate to him  Tom  Communicate to him How eloquent an Intrigue with a Gentleman makes a Chambermaid  Bet  You grow saucy Friend  Tom  Come come Mrs  Betty  for once hear Truth however disagreeable it may sound What can you propose by being acquainted with a Gentleman If you mean no Harm 'tis playing with edg'd Tools You may hurt yourself tho' but in Play And if you shou'd as insensibly you may go too far the utmost you can pretend to rise to is to be hisAnd for how long Time A Month two three a Year suppose At the End of which he leaves you perhaps with Child Return to Service No You're above it You change Masters till you've serv'd all the Town and your Wages are Infamy and DiseasesNay Mrs  Betty  'tis wholesome Physick and if you take it may make you well again  Bet  I cou'd cry for Madness But I don't care I'll never mend when I'm told of my Faults in so gross a Manner  Tom  Whereas if you give Way to a Passion with one of equal Rank with you his Designs at least are honourable He will not presume above what he may reasonably expect He'll court you for a Wife and if he has deserved well of his Master and you of your Mistress they'll make you a Present that may enable you  Bet  To set up a Chandler's Shop and live upon selling of Half Pennyworth's of SmallBeer  and Quarters of Ounces of Tea Foh What a Life But before we arrive to this charming State this envied Period of Servitude what Dangers do we not run thro' If our Masters or Mistresses discover we are married Warning is immediately given and we must provide for ourselves If they know nothing of it we find so many Excuses to get out to see each other and stay so long when we are sent on Errands that we are sure to be turn'd away And then farewel all Hopes of this noble Settlement We live in a Garret breed like tame Rabbits wear out the Cloaths we got in Service and having no Money to buy more stink in coarse Rags and mutually curse each other to the melodious Concert of half a Dozen squaling Brats about our Ears  Tom  Well Mrs  Betty  you may be as witty as you please but give me leave to tell you  Bet  I have not done yet I heard you out now hear me I'll grant you a Chambermaid loses her Character the other Way but if she has any Beauty and Wit to make the most of it it will go hard if she do not make it worth her while And Money Mr  Thomas  you know hides a great many Faults Then the Elegancies of Life wipe away a Spot in one's Character or at least make one bear with it Good Cloaths Meat Drink Diversions To rise from a low State to an Affluence of Fortune and Pleasure at least to her Oh the Joy's not to be describ'd one must feel it After all one can at last match with one's Equal He'll be glad to have us if we bring our Welcome with us He won't be so nice as to refuse a handsome Suit of Cloaths because it has been a little soil'd and we may perhaps be enabled to carry on a genteeler Profession than a Chandler's Shop  Tom  Well Mrs  Betty    Bell rings  Oh my Master rings If you'll step in here I'll tell him you're below  Exit  Bet  I follow you I can but take up with this Fellow at last I'll try

'tis the Weakness of our Nature I'll tell you Sir  we can't confine our Thoughts to what we suffer with you that indeed might cure us But we let 'em loose and they bring back to our charm'd Senses

deceiv'd by every Man I trust to and that's the greatest Curse that could happen to me So far 'tis well I'm secure of Lady  Traffick  if I can but work upon my own Lady as well I may make 'em all quarrel and then I may perhaps get him to myself I'm sure he likes my Person and that is the best Hold People may talk of Sense and Virtue and all that They may be good in a formal Wife but in a Mistress let her but have an agreeable Temper and a pretty PersonHeyho I'm melancholy all of a sudden Wou'd Sir  Harry  was here Yet I ought not to wish that neither for one kind Word from him wou'd make this Letter drop out of my Hands and at once destroy my Plot Bless me he is here I'll hide the Letter tho' and stand aside  Puts it in her Bosom  Perhaps I may discover something  Enter Sir  Harry  Sir Har  Was ever Man so justly punish'd How barbarous am I to that unfortunate Creature who owes her Ruin twice to me Yet what can I do I can never marry her tho' she has my Promise I ought then at least never to think of any else Yet if I remain unfix'd so strong are my Passions I shall never conquer 'em and I may make  more Victims still  Angelina  I think has Charms enough to keep me

tell her all O lud here's my Lady and Madam  Laetitia  with her I'll retire before they see me  Exit  Enter  Angelina  and  Laetitia  Ang  We've lost Sir  Lively  and Mr  Heartly  Laet  They are but stept into my Brother's to bring him here They'll be soon enough never fear They'll not give us too much breathing Time  Ang  You'll want it I'm sure you've run so fast one wou'd think you were going to meet a Lover  Laet  Rather as if I were flying from one Sure nothing's so detestable as a Man of Sense that pretends to be a Lover Love is a quite different Thing in him than in other Men  Ang  Only so much the more agreeable  Laet  Agreeable O gad how can you think so Well I shall hardly be able to bear any Lover this Month I'm sure I have been so pester'd by my sensible one  Ang  I rather think you'll be able to bear none but him 'Tis a sure Sign when a Woman is uneasy with what her Lover says she wishes at least he wou'd talk in another Manner and that my dear is one Step towards wishing for something else  Laet  Something else What pray  Ang  Why to like what he does say  Laet  Lud bless me you're strangely positive You wou'd fain make me believe  Ang  What if I am any Judge you will very soon own  Laet  Own what  Ang  That you love him  Laet  Him Whom  Ang  Heartly Heartly  Come come Child all this affected railing  Laet  Nay then we must change the Discourse How d'you think the tedious Creature entertain'd me at the Auction this Morning  Ang  So this is changing the DiscourseNay the Lord knows I'm sure in the Humour you are 'twas fifty to one any thing he said cou'd please you  Laet  Why by expressing his Pleasure at the beautiful Appearance the Company made by remarking the Variety of Tastes that reign'd in the Choice of Cloaths and by drawing Conclusions from the Singularity of some Dresses of the Sense and Understanding of their Wearers The Wretch did not say a Word of me all the while and scarce look'd at me But I was even with him  Ang  Oh I don't question that But how pray  Laet  Why in the Midst of these wise Remarks which he thought I took as much Pleasure to hear as he did to make Sir  Lively Brainless  came running from the other Side of the Room and desir'd me to look at a young Lady that stood close by me Madam said he wou'd you believe it This young Lady I met at the other End of the Room and thought her one of the most beautiful Creatures I ever saw but when she came and stood by you she appear'd to me so eclips'd and dim'd that I came to see if it was the same Person I did not know her again I vow to gad Lord Sir  Lively  said I you've so pretty a Way of laughing at one that one can't be angry This drew a  Repartee from him and that another from me so that  Heartly  I suppose finding our Dialogue too long very civilly took his Leave and I very civilly let him go Ha ha  Ang  Barbarous Creature How cou'd you use him so  Laet  Wou'd I cou'd use him ten times worse But come my Dear shall we go to  Ang  Go Whither wou'd you go Child Why they'll be here this Instant  Laet  Nay if you've a mind to stay I am very willing to keep you Company  Ang  No my dear I'd as lieve go  Laet  So had I too but I don't know it wou'd look odd to go wou'd it not  Ang  I don't know if it would look odd but I perceive you think it wou'd Hark I think I hear 'em in the next Room Come my dear you are very unwilling now are you not

Jen  Madam  Lady Traf  If Sir  Harry  comes I am gone out Be sure you deny me if he shou'd come before I am gone  Jen  Yes Madam  Ex L  Traffick  and  Betty    What can the Meaning of this be The Doors us'd to fly open at his Approach Well 'tis not my Business  Enter Sir  Harry  Sir Har  This was lucky That curs'd Jade  Betty  to enter into a Plot against me As to my Lady  Traffick  her Wrongs indeed might stir her to Revenge I must go to her and try if I can calm her My Promise of Marriage to her and her Knowledge of my Affair with  Louisa  both fairly stated in this damn'd Letter wou'd have done my Business with  Angelina  Is my Lady  Traffick  above  Jen  No Sir she's just gone out  Sir Har  Gone out Whither  Jen  I really can't tell but she went out with Mrs  Betty  Lady  Angelina  's Woman  Sir Har  So Damnation Gone to  Angelina  's I suppose Hold I may perhaps get thither before 'em  aside  How long is it since they went  Jen  The Moment before you enter'd  Sir Har  'Tis well I yet may overtake them  Exeunt severally  Angelina  's House  Enter  Angelina  Sir  Lively    Laetitia  and  Heartly  Ang  We were too late Sir  Lively  you have lost  Sir Liv  I do confess it Madam The Bird was flown but we'll cage him yet However Madam I hope what Mrs  Darnwell  said was sufficient to satisfy you in the main  Laet  Angelina  is it fair to engross Sir  Lively  thus  Sir Liv  I protest and vow Madam I ask Pardon But I thought  Ned  there cou'd entertain a Lady for a Quarter of an Hour without tiring her I had something of Consequence to tell this LadyI hope Madam what I have already discover'd merits some Consideration  To  Angel  Ang  But I must have stronger Proofs Sir  Lively  Sir Liv  You shall Madam or may I be blasted by your Frowns like a too forward Tree by the Wind  Ang  This Fool will make me discover how much I despise him before I've made the Use I intend of him if I don't render the Discourse more generalMr  Heartly Laetitia  methinks for two Persons that are always quarrelling in Company you agree very well by yourselves  Laet  I protest my dear you are as full of Malice as an old Maid and bestow it as often on your FriendsOh here's my Brother  Enter Sir  Harry  Sir Har  I see no Marks of Lady  Traffick  's having been here yet in  Angelina  's Looks  aside  Madam your Servant  Ang  Your Servant Sir  Harry  Laet  I believe my Dear we are beholden to you for his Company I never see him but here  Ang  You wou'd give me an ill Opinion of your Brother  Laetitia  Sir Har  He that gets her good Word Madam must have more Complaisance for her Humours than falls to the Share of a Brother If you Madam but think favourably of me I shall not concern myself much how I stand in her whimsical Judgment  Hear  You see Madam what an Opinion your Brother has of you  Laet  I wou'd advise you Sir to take the Model from him  Gravely  Sir Liv  If I judge right Sir a Sister can best tell  Sir Har  But you do not judge right Sir and never will That's more  Sir Liv  Ah  le Brutal  He's jealous I'll plague him a littleSir  Harry  Madam is so taken up with his own Thoughts that he has no Taste for the Conversation of the Beau Monde Your Men of Sense are always the dullest Animals in Company Take 'em from their Books and their highspun Notions which they do not understand themselves and you may fall asleep for want of Conversation  Sir Har  And let me tell you Sir 'tis an Advantage to sleep in some Companies Your Body's refresh'd and your Mind not tir'd  Sir Liv  Politely said The Ladies are oblig'd to you  Ang  Believe me Sir  Lively  there are Charms in a Man of Sense a Woman thinks can never be too dearly purchas'd Your Sister and I Sir  Harry  tho' very good Friends differ a little in our Opinions  At least she would be thought to differ with me  Hear  What was the Subject of your Dispute then Ladies  Laet  A mere Trifle Sir a Man  Hear  'Twas a happy Trifle however  Ang  I did not expect less from so polite a Man as Mr  Heartly  But we were disputing at least coming to it which would make the most agreeable Companion for Life a Man of Sense or a pretty Fellow  Sir Liv  Shrugging  Ah MadamHow she ey'd me She's taken Nay I never doubted these Parts  Aside  Sir Har  Well Madam and how did you determine the Point  Sir Liv  Hark'ee Sir  Harry  don't press this Matter farther for your own sake You may hear something you may not like  Sir Har  Pert Coxcomb  Aside  Ang  Why truly Sir  Harry  you came in before we determin'd any thing about it  Sir Har  Then Madam we are not too late to hear it  Sir Liv  Ay ay Madam let's hear it Pronouncedecide  Ang  Why really Sir  Lively  my Opinion is a Man of Sense can never make a bad Husband unless he has a bad or foolish Wife He may rob his Wife of many tender Moments and bestow them on underserving Creatures If she has but Prudence she will conquer  Sir Liv  Gad I don't like that tho'  Aside  Sir Har  A Woman Madam that thinks as you do brings too much Happiness along with her not to prevent any Man's seeking it elsewhere  Ang  That's more than I know Sir  Sir Liv  Oh I thought she wou'd come about again  Aside  A Man of Sense Madam will expect so many Things in a Wife that it will be impossible for her to satisfy him Now a pretty Fellow Madam is easier and has always something light and gay to entertain her with  Ang  Very true Sir  Lively  Yet if I lov'd him I think I could not have too much of his Company if not too little  Sir Har  How delicate her Sentiments are and yet how tender  Sir Liv  I don't know what to make of this tho'Nay Madam if you won't take what I say for granted I have done I never prove any thing I only assert If it hits right well If not it gives me an Opportunity to pay a Compliment to a Lady's Understanding by retracting what I assert and owning myself convinc'd by her superior Sense  Ang  I'm afraid Sir  Lively  the Ladies are more oblig'd to their Sex than Sense when they bring you over But let's change this Discourse We grow too serious  Enter Servant whispers Sir  Lively  Sir Liv  A Servant at my House say you from my Uncle  Serv  Yes Sir and he says he must see you immediately  Sir Liv  I come  Exit Serv  Ang  We shan't lose you Sir  Lively  Sir Liv  aside  Kind Soul She can't be a Moment without meNo Madam I'll but just receive the old Gentleman's Commands and return swift as my own Wishesor yours  Exit  Sir Har  This Opportunity is lucky Draw off my Sister  To Hear  Hear  to Laet  Madam you promis'd to shew me the fine Screen you bought for Lady  Angelina  this Morning  Laet  That's true 'tis but in the next Room Come Mr  Heartly  follow me and I'll shew it you 'Tis exceeding pretty  Hear  I don't doubt it Madam if it be your Taste  Ang  Where are you gadding now  Laet  But into the next RoomMy Brother will be glad of this Opportunity  Aside  Exit Laet and Hear  Ang  If you stay there I'll follow youWhat do they mean by leaving me alone  Aside  Sir Har  I don't know how to begin I never was at a Loss before  Aside  Ang  What shall I say to him This Silence is worse than any thing I can say I don't know what to talk of  Aside  Methinks they stayvery longSir  Harry  Sir Har  confus'd  I can never think the Time long Madam that furnishes me with an Opportunity of being alone with a Woman whose Conversation has equal Charms with her Person and whose Person  Ang  Sir  Sir Har  I'm dumb I never put the honourable Question before and am as aukward at it  Aside  I say Madam there is something so soft in the Society of a Woman of Sense and Beauty that a Man bless'd by Fortune in other Respects wants nothing but to pass his Life with such a Companion to be compleatly happy  Ang  You differ very much Sir  Harry  from the fine Gentlemen of the Age who seem not to  think Sense in a Woman so essential to the married State  Sir Har  Experience Madam is the Mother of true Judgment Those fine Gentlemen you mention are either too young to judge right or too much hurried by their Passions which Fortune enables 'em to indulge to Excess to follow what is right  Ang  It must however give a thinking Woman some Pain to find even Men of Sense can't value them as they ought till they are sated with Pleasures and have lost their Relish for them  Sir Har  The Education of our Sex so different from that of yours gives us such early and unbounded Liberties that a thinking Woman must look with Indulgence on our early Failings especially since we are the principal Sufferers in neglecting real Happiness to follow the Phantom  Ang  Come come Sir  Harry  this Apology ought not to pass for the sensible Part of your Sex who stray in full Daylight  Sir Har  Then Madam let me throw myself at your Feet and acknowledge my Faults Give me leave to thank you for putting me in the right Way and allow me to conduct my future Steps by your better Judgment  Ang  What does he meanYou rally me Sir  Harry  Sir Har  Well may you think it so Madam The Looseness of my former Life which I've wanted even Discretion to hide may make you call in question my present more serious Resolutions  Ang  I must not hear you Sir  Harry  Going  Sir Har  Forgive me Madam if I detain you  against your Will Let me be still more plain talk to your Sense and not your Sex There never was any Person how wild soever he may have been but in his more serious Moments has form'd some Scheme of Happiness for Life How often tho' perhaps you'll not believe it have I pleas'd myself that the Time would come when I should arrive at that happy Calm that fits one for such a Life Hitherto my Joys however great have been imperfect Reflection will be heard and lead soon or late to a right Way of Acting What I have been I would have every body forget as much as I myself shall avoid henceforth to be What I shall be depends not on myself The Scheme of Happiness I now propose  Ang  I must interrupt him or he'll go too far  Aside  If that Scheme be a virtuous one Sir  Harry  I wish you Success in it with all my Heart  Sir Har  Bare Wishes however kind cannot compleat my Happiness  Ang  When Wishes are all we have  Sir Har  There Madam I must contradict you  Ang  What is he going to say  Aside  Sir Har  The Scheme of Happiness which I propose is founded on that tender Friendship which the married State alone can entertain  Ang  How I tremble  Aside  Sir Har  But a Youth so inconsiderately spent as mine scarce gives me Room to hope I shall be credited when I assure you I have long conceal'd a Passion I scarce dare even now discover Be not surpriz'd at this Confession Madam however strange my Conduct may appear it may perhaps hereafter be explain'd could I but flatter myself that I should find in you a Judge inclin'd to hear me with a favourable Ear  Ang  Press me no further Sir  Harry  One can never think too much on that which must make one's future Happiness or Misery Let it suffice for this Time I can see your good Qualities thro' the Cloud of Passions that o'ercast them  Sir Har  Then Madam be you the Sun whose genial Warmth shall ripen them into Virtues This is the Crisis of my Fate  Enter  Betty  whispers  Angelina  I little thought I spoke so true Damn'd Jade This must be some Message from my Lady  Traffick  Aside  Ang  A Lady say you desires to speak with me on something that concerns me nearly  Sir Har  Ay 'tis so The Devil  Aside  Ang  What can this be Something I dare say that relates to his Youth too inconsiderately spent indeed Pray Heaven no body claims a Right to him  Aside  Conduct her to my Closet I'll come instantly  Bet  I shall be reveng'd now  Sir Har frowns  No matter for that  Exit  Ang  Sir  Harry  I must beg your Pardon for a little while a particular Reason obliges me to leave you for a Moment In next Room you'll find Mr  Heartly  and your Sister I shall not stay  Sir Har  Let me beg you wou'd not leave me quite uncertain of my Fate One Word might make me the happiest of my Sex Give me but Leave to hope  Ang  Why should I hide my Sentiments any longer I do love him and wish him mine  Aside  Well Sir I give you Permission to believe as you wish  Sir Har  Kneeling kisses her Hand  On my Knees let me thank you My Heart is easy now I feel a Flow of JoyOh  Angelina  may I then hope to call you mine  Ang  I'm sure my Heart is easier than it was  aside  Well will you let me go now  Sir Har  Yes if you'll return quickly  Ang  Well well  Exit  Sir Har  I think I've nothing to fear now  At length my Bosom feels returning Rest  Love pleads my Cause in Angelina's Breast  Exit  END of the FOURTH ACT  ACT V  Enter  Heartly  and  Laetitia  Laet  MR  Heartly  you've been taking a great deal of Pains to convince me of a Thing I never can believe  Hear  What's that pray Madam  Laet  Why Sir that you are capable of being in Love  Hear  That's very hard Madam To be denied the Privilege of feeling what the meanest of my Sex feels is something tyrannical  Laet  The meanest of your Sex Profane Creature Can Love harbour in mean Breasts  Hear  Love Madam knows neither Birth nor Fortune Where it finds a Soul capable of receiving it it lodges and is as pleas'd to warm the meanest as the noblest Breast  Laet  I don't know what Love you talk of  Hear  The Love I talk of Madam is that Passion that fills us with generous Sentiments in Behalf of the Person we like and if the meanest Artisan in Proportion to his Sense and Understanding feels such Sentiments he feels Love in its greatest Delicacy  Laet  You talk like an Oracle Sir I shall improve  Hear  May I flatter myself Madam the Improvement will be to my Advantage It is but just since you are pleas'd to own it will come from me  Laet  Sir you seem too interested in your Wish to be capable of those generous Sentiments you require in a Lover  Hear  If to wish to possess a Woman who to an agreeable Person joins a superior Understanding and Temper fram'd to please and to be pleas'd be to be interested I own I am so and glory in it And if to these happy natural Circumstances I add the Consideration that she is Sister to my Friend nothing is wanting to compleat the Fulness of my Joy but  Laet  Butbutwhat Sir  Hear  I wou'd read it in your Eyes  takes her Hand she turns away  but you withdraw 'em from me 'Tis kindly done if arm'd with Anger not to let me see 'em but unkind if  Laet  IfifLord what are you going to say Well say what you will I am not in a Humour to contradict you There now read  Looks at him  Wellnay if you're so tedious  Hear  Tedious O I cou'd read for ever here My Joy's too great for Words to give it Vent  Laet  I have betray'd myself he sees too much  Aside  Come Mr  Heartly  let's go to my Brother and  Angelina  What will they think of us  Hear  I believe Madam they've thought as little of us as we of them  Going  Enter Sir  Harry  Sir Har  O Sister O Friend If you refuse me your Assistance now my Peace of Mind is gone for ever  Laet  What d'you mean Brother I never saw  you thus before You seem too concern'd not to command our utmost Speak  Sir Har  Heartly  you remember the Story I told you this Morning You'll explain it to my Sister I have no Time to lose now That Lady is now with  Angelina  Revenge has push'd her to destroy my Hopes in her whom I had just before brought to confess a Regard for me I found a growing Passion in every Word and Lookbut fear shall never see it more She by this knows all my former foolish Engagement and I know her Virtue is too delicate ever to consent were there but the Shadow of a Promise extant against me  Hear  This is unfortunate indeed But I wou'd advise you to join them immediately I'll but prepare your Sister and we'll follow you Time enough perhaps to save you  Sir Har  O Friend I cannot stir My Conscience weighs me down I can never face that injur'd guiltless Woman not dare behold the aweful Severity of  Angelina  's Looks My Heart is torn betwixt conflicting Resolutions Virtue and Passion move me with such equal Force I can yield to neither and to live divided thus  Hear  Come come you must go The Presence of what we love oft weakens the strongest Argument against us  Laet  aside  There is some Truth in that Come Brother Mr  Heartly  advises well  Hear  Nay I will be Master now  Forces him out  Another Apartment of  Angelina  's  Enter  Angelina  and Lady  Traffick  Lady Traf  You've heard my Story Madam  Ang  I've heard indeed too much  Aside  Lady Traf  What can you expect from one so void of Honour and of Truth  Ang  What indeed  Lady Traf  'Tis true I cannot force him to marry me but till I have disengag'd him from his Vow he cannot be another's  Ang  Oh no If what you say is true and there is but too much Reason to believe it tho' I lov'd him better than ever Woman yet lov'd I never wou'd be his Nor will I build my Happiness on your Misfortune  Lady Traf  I thank you Madam I expected no less from you    Angelina  walks about concern'd  Enter Sir  Harry  Ha he's here Be firm my Heart and let me speak my Wrongs tho' I shou'd lose him quite and be for ever miserable  Sir Har  'Tis she Confusion I read my Fate in  Angelina  's Looks  Lady Traf  Here Madam he is be you my Judge If he denies a Word of what I say let me be still more wretched if possible than I amSirI cannot look at him and speakyet I mustSir 'tis to you I speak answer me Did you not rob me of my Innocence under the solemn Promise of Marriage Were not our Vows exchang'd and mutually plighted to each other Did you not break these Vows almost  assoon as made and force me tho' my Tears and faithful Love to you spoke my Reluctance to give myself to another Did you not even tempt me to violate the very Vows which you compell'd me to make I was not quite so lost to Virtue Can you deny all thisNo Your Silence justifies the Charge  Ang  I see too plain it does I want no other ProofMadam believe I feel your Wrongs as if they were my own Compassion is the Glory of our Sex and well becomes its Softness'Tis now too late Sir  Harry  to deny I had harbour'd some favourable Sentiments of you But tho' I have a Soul that can love know it can combat any Sentiment which wrongs another or itself You see Sir the Reason of my Conduct and cannot censure my Justice  Sir Har  I can't indeed Your Sentence Madam is just The Wrongs I've done this Lady whose only Fault was loving me too tenderly merit the severest Punishment You have it in your Power and do inflict it I've made one miserable wou'd there were but one 'tis just I shou'd be so myself  Lucia  you seem to be surpriz'd to see me with so calm a Look Know that I'm asham'd of my inhuman Usage of you and will make any Amends within my Power You sought Revenge you have it and I blame you not Cou'd Love once fled return even that I'd give for I have been a Savage to you and wanted even Humanity to pity you  Lady Traf  These Words Sir  Harry  at another Time had made me the happiest of my Sex but now they serve to make me the most miserable I see by sad Experience I render both myself and you unhappy But I will tear this Tyrant Love from my fond Bosom since it can meet with no Return from yours  Sir Har  Let me but tell you what Return you may expect  Lady Traf  What wou'd you tell me I know you cannot love me Were it in your Power I do believe you wou'd I know you are human tender and goodnatur'd But wild Desires and unruly Passions tear up all that's generous in you and leave you to a considering Mind an Object of Compassion even more than me  Ang  Who could wrong such Goodness  Aside  Lady Traf  Hear me Sir  Harry  'tis perhaps for the last Time I can never hate you Hate you did I sayAh no I must for ever love you spite of myself 'Tis equitable too I should Thus wise Providence will make my Crime my Punishment  Sir Har  Call it not so 'Twas I deceiv'd you You believ'd me lawfully yours and indulg'd a Fondness that well became your Youth and Passion Add not to your unhappy Fate a Crime you were not guilty of  Lady Traf  No more of that For my own Peace I will avoid seeing you more I give up all those flattering Thoughts of Happiness with which I fed my poor deluded Heart A Happiness that was so great it stifled all the Cries of Conscience and of Honour My future Care shall be to make my Peace with Heaven and lead a Life if possible without Misery  Sir Har  How contemptible do I appear to her superior Merit  Lady Traf  I came hither with a Design to revenge myself on you but I have since reflected I could not punish you without involving more than the Guilty Nay I find I cannot have the Heart to punish you  Ang  Generous Creature  Aside  Lady Traf  Hear me Whilst you continue free  and disengag'd I shall still think I have some Right to you and perhaps indulge some fond Wishes that will only make me miserable Were you engag'd the Knowledge that you cannot be mine would strengthen my Reason and free my future Life from Conflicts dangerous to my Peace of Mind  Ang  Ha what's that  Aside  Lady Traf  Madam 'tis to you I now speak I told you of a Promise of Marriage from Sir  Harry  to me made in early Youth As we were both too young to judge of Happiness when that Vow was made I here acquit him of his Promise and withdraw my own He is now free  Ang  This is too much I'll never be outdone in Generosity  Sir Har  Lucia  you have indeed reveng'd yourself This generous Action will never be forgot nor ever be remember'd but with Pain  Turns to Ang  Ang  Hold Sir True Happiness must be without Alloy I shall never think of this Lady but I shall look upon myself as a Bar to her Peace of Mind And tho' thro' Excess of Goodness which very Goodness shou'd confound you she can give up her Happiness to procure that of the Man by whom she's ruin'd I never can consent and never will Your Reason Sir  Harry  points the Path you have to follow mine which I am to avoid  Lady Traf  The Sentiment Madam is kind and generous But my Misery or Happiness must henceforward depend upon myself alone and I Madam will never be his He is freeHere Sir  Harry  is your Letter I could almost wish I had never seen it but since I have let me beg you never to see that Person more Her Passion is but young she yet may conquer it if you avoid seeing her  Sir Har  I never will  Ang  Take Comfort Madam There are but few that know this fatal Secret Believe me Madam as delicate a Sense of Virtue as I have I do acquit you Have Patience you may yet be happy  Lady Traf  I will be govern'd by you Your Leave Madam at present to retire I am unfit to stay  Ang  Yet more unfit to go Make my House your Home till you are

Hark'ee she's a fine Woman faith  Sir Har  Well and you saw her  Ang  How he questions him  Aside  Sir Liv  Ay But such a Sight I found her all in Tears just recover'd from a fainting Fit I suppose her Father's Letter with the News of her sudden Happiness disorder'd her  Sir Har  aside  I fancy I cou'd give a better Reason for it  Sir Liv  But egad I never minded that I made my Speech and 'twas a pretty one upon my Honour  Sir Har  I believe you Sir  Turns away  Sir Liv  So cold Perhaps Sir you are some secret Rival  Sir Har  No faith Sir And to prove that I have no Pretension to her if this Lady since you have told her she must not think of you were inclin'd to believe she has Charms enough to reclaim me  Ang  I don't know whether I ought to venture 'Tis a great Risque when Happiness lies at Stake But come Sir  Harry  'tis too late now to go back Here's my Hand If I have Reason to repent I can blame none but myself  Sir Har  I dare venture to assure you you will have none  Hear

Masters of the Key to them Ha ha  Enter  Betty  Bet  I'm impatient till I know what's done I'll venture inMadam did your Ladiship call  Ang  No  Bet  Has your Ladiship any more Commands  Sir Har  No Child but I have With your Leave Madam  Ang  You must command now  Sir Har  I have a Man that has serv'd me long and faithfully The Way of Life I am now going into renders his Service useless to me I long intended him a Farm of forty Pounds a Year But as he will want a neat and clean Housekeeper to share the Management of it I have fix'd my Eyes on Mrs  Betty  your Woman who seems to be cut out for an excellent Housewife  Bet  Are all my Hopes come to this  Sir Har  Here  Tom  Enter  Tom  Sirrah what say you to a Farm of  l  a Year and a pretty Wife  Tom  And a Child already got I supposeSir for the Farm I return you my most grateful Acknowledgements for that cannot but turn out a real Good and Advantage to me How this other Freehold may prove I can't tellBut 'tis no  MatterI'll venture to take a Lease for Life But hark'ee my Dear no Husbandman but myself d'you hear no Labourer to help me to do my Work I'll warrant thee Girl I'll keep thee in good Order myself  Bet  Well  Tom  if thou art but as good as thy Word I promise thee thou shalt reap the Fruits of Nobody's Labour but thy own But take heed If like a lazy Lubbard you grow idle and lee good Land run into Common for want of enriching the Soil as it ought it will fall to the Lord of the Manor again and then you know he has a Right to turn his own Cattle a grazing there  Sir Har  Come Madam we are now engag'd in a Voyage for Life 'Tis for both our Interests to make it agreeable and happy I shall do my Endeavour to give you no Uneasiness Let's forget the past and look forward  When Passion governs with despotick Sway  And its enchanting Dictates we obey  Our Spirits lifted up a while we sail  And plough Love's Ocean with a prosperous Gale  Till like a Tempest Vice at last appears  And full on Rocks and dangerous Quicksands bears  If then some Pilot with unerring Hand  Oe'r the lost Barque deigns but to take Command  The Rocks we dreaded most with Ease be shuns  And safe to Port the sinking Vessel runs  Exeunt Omnes  END of the FIFTH ACT
