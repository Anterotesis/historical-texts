 CARISBROOK CASTLE  THE  ISLE  of  WIGHT  A POEM In THREE CANTOS  Happy Isle  Like Hesperian gardens fam'd of old  Fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales  Thrice happy Isle  MILTON  ISLE OF WIGHT Printed by J MALLETT and Sold by the Miss WISE'S and Mr STURCH Booksellers in NEWPORT and Mr ROBERT DEACON of WESTCOWES  To those GENTLEMEN and LADIES Who occasionally visit the ISLAND FOR HEALTH OR PLEASURE And express their ADMIRATION of its BEAUTIES AND MORE PARTICULARLY TO THOSE WHO ARE ITS STATED RESIDENTS  And honourably distinguished by  Their HOSPITALITY and BENEVOLENCE THIS POEM IS MOST RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED BY THE  EDITOR  THE ISLE of WIGHT A POEM IN THREE CANTOS  CANTO I  THOU precious gem in nature's bosom plac'd  With all her bounty all her beauty grac'd  Thou model of her wond'rous vast design  Where all her wisdom all her grace combine  To make in miniature her greatness show  The Almighty architect confess'd below  Complete epitome for ever stand  The perfect master piece of wisdom's hand  To strike the astonish'd eye to charm the soul  Another paradise so near the pole  In nature's arms embrac'd her store design'd  Where all extremes successive fill the mind  Where all the north can shake with his rude arm  Where all the south can sooth can gently warm  Alternate threaten and alternate charm  Thou little world divided from the great  Where pleasure sports and plenty rules in state  Where nature in her richest robe is dress'd  Transparent robe distinguish'd from the rest  Thy summer mantle o'er the mountains thrown  That blue aetherial gauze in Eden known  Adorns thy hills thy vallies and thy shore  And tho' it seems to hide reveals thee more  Thy summers revel with serenest pride  Thy silver seas roll murmuring near thy side  The smoothest seas thy peaceful shores now lave  And Halcyons slumber on thy sliding wave  Ceres and Flora bless thy teeming vales  And load with fragrance sweet the passing gales  Far off on Ocean's smiling face they play  And thy rich treasures to the pole convey  Thy fragrant breath now lulls the enamour'd deep  All nature's passions on her surface sleep  Thy crystal firmament now shines serene  Around the silver throne of night's pale queen  Whose golden gems with living lustre glow  Reflected from the liquid glass below  A mimic heaven in that bright mirror lives  That mocks the true yet all its splendor gives  Here bounteous nature to her purpose true  Bestows her beauty and her picture too  Her picture here she must with pride survey  Her smiling likeness in its best array  Lo white inverted rocks upgrown with green  Their waving verdure in the ocean seen  The downward trees with gentle bendings move  Obedient to the gale that breath of love  Soft whisp'ring to the trembling leaves above  The magic picture charms the gazer's eye  That seems to mingle with the stars and sky  The stars and sky their mimic lustre lend  And with the rocks and verdure seem to blend  The stars and sky their mimic lustre lend  And with the rocks and verdure seem to blend  Where pleasing shadowy shapes serene and pure  In darkness visible in light obscure  With doubtful certainty inchant the sight  Like the dim neutral dusk that mingles day with night  WHAT inbred raptures in my bosom swell  When on the inchanting scene I silent dwell  Abstracted from myself still more and more  The vision I revere the scene adore  Where truth and fiction all their charms reveal  And sense and fancy at their feast regale  Where bribed reason banquets on the cheat  And judgment triumphs in the wise deceit  Gay fancy here her flattering medium proves  Like each fond fallacy in life she loves  Where oft appearance mocks the sanguine view  And false attractives please as well as true  DELIGHTED nature o'er this island dwells  And to the deep her joyful story tells  The deep returns it to the azure space  And earth and heaven and ocean here embrace  HERE day and night in sweet succession vie  Here spring and autumn glide melodious by  The earliest harbingers that lead the year  Sweet Philomela tunes her note first here  First here her tuneful note begins to swell  And here she takes her mournful sweet farewell  The primrose here and swallow first are seen  And here the groves put on their earliest green  Here fragrant gales first fan the teeming groves  Here little birds begin their vernal loves  Here zephyrs wave at first the vigorous wing  Here handmaid Nature decks the fullrob'd spring  The summer loiters here with lagging grace  And late reluctant yields to autumn place  The tardy autumn pausing long gives Way  And mourns the twilight keen the shrinking day  The shatter'd gossomer the stripping wind  And sighing leaves his russet robe behind  Now winter in his turn asserts his reign  And frowns upon the long untroubled main  With blustering breath he bids the billows roll  And sends the stormy message to the pole  Awakes the winds and bids them sudden roar  Around the yelling rocks and hollow shore  With dignity disturbs the scene lo then  With noble terror shakes the souls of men  Now Neptune's haughty surge insults the walls  Flies o'er the roof and in the midland falls  Above the rocks these fighting whirlpools tower  The lofty rocks and fall a misty shower  Like smoke from hot Bellona's bowels fly  Darken the earth and intercept the sky  Now night with her black robe invelops all  Now horror hides the loud beleaguer'd ball  With grandeur here wild winter roars around  Here echoing hills and rocks repeat the sound  In harmony made grateful to the ear  That strikes with majesty and awes with fear  With pride the bold inhabitants endure  The storm magnificent themselves secure  Triumphant here they hug their blissful lot  And all this hostile rage is soon forgot  NOT so where India's sun severely shines  On diamond quarries deep on golden mines  To ripen mischief with his burning ray  And bring these earthborn evils forth to day  Here toiling slaves their time their life employ  For what themselves nor we can ne'er enjoy  Oh madding mortals spare your mother spare  Nor wounded nature to her vitals tare  In quest of gold you cleave the groaning ground  Whilst earth's deep center trembles at the wound  Why dig so deep why frenzy's thirst improve  Since all that wisdom wants o'erflows above  Here nature's fever unabating glows  The scorching year no intermission knows  No friendly interval the wretch can find  No gentle jubilee no cooling wind  No near expected change no genial springs  The tyger tears him or the scorpion stings  THRICE happy Britain born in nature's prime  Thou queen of nations happy in thy clime  Thy seasons moderate as thy laws appear  Thy constitution wholesome as the year  Well pois'd and pregnant in thy annual round  With wisdom where no fierce extreme is found  Where British wisdom copies nature's law  And mingles mildness oft with state and awe  Where strength and freedom in their prime prevail  And wealth comes wafted on each freighted gale  Where commerce lifts her flag with mighty hand  And waves it round the world with wide command  The willing world thy matchless flag explores  Ten thousand vessels from ten thousand shores  With hasty keels obey thy wide command  Stretch o'er thy seas and rush upon thy strand  See seel with ships the labouring ocean heave  A different nation crowns each different wave  The tribute of the globe to Britain sent  That dreaded queen of all the Continent  What floating forests whitening to the eye  Their different streamers as they draw more nigh  In various colours deck'd in different mode  Display their treasure king and lov'd abode  From India east and west see see what shoals  From Europe's regions and the distant poles  With amorous haste how emulous they meet  To pour their treasures at Britannia's feet  When here they pause this precious spot behold  They look with scorn upon their gems and gold  Medina's shore with raptures they survey  And lose the labours of the lengthen'd way  Each danger now is joyfully forgot  Each toil o'erpaid by this delicious spot  MEDINA  The Capital River in the I sland so called it rises in the South and winding in a beautiful serpentine direction discharges itself into Cowes Harbour which divides the same nearly into equal hundreds from thence the one is called East and the other West MEDINAThis River is only navigable from Cowes to Newport  hail nor my weak verse refuse  Thou subject worthy of a Milton's muse  His muse improv'd by such a theme would be  His own rich Eden might compare with thee  Oh long unsung Oh argument divine  And shall at length the glorious task be mine  That task descend to my inferior hand  Leastnot least zealous of the tuneful band  I feel my fancy kindle in the view  And raptur'd as she leads the theme pursue  THE astonish'd muse must stand at silent gaze  Scarce knowing where to choose or what to praise  Amidst a crowded galaxy so bright  Where every object yields supreme delight  A group so grateful to the sight and soul  O'erwhelms the heart and must the mind controul  YON beauteous hill by artless art embrac'd  Where russet plainness wears the robe of taste  That nobly o'er the widespread landskip reigns  Above the extended strand and watry plains  Invites the muse with sweet majestic mien  To climb the summit and enjoy the scene  Words would but wrong the wonder and amaze  That in an instant fix'd me all to gaze  In silent raptures I some moments stand  Charm'd with each object that adorns the land  Fix'd to the spot  Tie Downs leading to Freshwater  and speechless with surprize  At such a vast expanse of sea and skies  Of woods of vallies and of bluerob'd hills  The groupe with extasy my bosom fills  Each faculty but wonder I lay by  Transported in the twinkling of an eye  By nature's utmost boast expanded wide  Her utmost beauty and her utmost pride  The gorgeous ships see glide promiscuous by  That strike with harmony the ravish'd eye  Their form their fashions and their shining sides  That glitter in the sun and gild the tides  Their flying streamers and their pregnant sails  That court the eye and gather all the gales  In scant perspective now at distance shine  Now sweeping nearer to the banks incline  In all their outspread grandeur full confess'd  As if for some solemnity they dress'd  Their beauteous fabrics in the watry glass  Saluting still this summit as they pass  Their streamers and their sails they glad display  With pleasing triumph and with proud delay  Still traversing in labyrinths the deep  Whilst all their order and their courses keep  Opposing now they meet now lose now gain  Now some the harbour seek now some the main  The tall first rates their towering splendors show  And look superior on the crowd below  Harmonious to the guiding helm they sail  Whilst voices oft and music crown the gale  So when Britannia's matchless dames unite  Their shining charms on George's natal night  Like constellations gliding in the dance  With mixed modes serene they now advance  Now stately turn with measur'd step around  In mazes sweet obedient to the sound  The coy profile see frugal now address'd  Now the full face now beauteous form confess'd  With various attitudes they graceful sway  With various charms and bear the soul away  My praise on truth not fiction's wing would rise  Whilst gratitude my want of wit supplies  Respect not pride provokes my muse to soar  As wrens like eagles may the sun explore  END OF THE FIRST CANTO  CANTO II  NEEDLE ROCKS  NOW wafted slowly by the indented shore  With panting heart the  Those celebrated Rocks so much admired at the West end of the Isle  needles we explore  Nor feel the kind digressions on

glide  See Hurst's strong Castle rooted in the Tide  And now the Ocean opens to our eyes  See ships like clouds from out the offing rise  The Needles now with dawning gleams appear  Like the grey glimpses when the morn is near  That whiter grows as Boreas mends the breeze  Their bluish mantle fading by degrees  Is vanish'd now the rocks are now express'd  And beauty stands before us all undress'd  With tempting Majesty serene yet coy  That damps at once at once provokes our joy  Conceding gradual with a placid mien  Where grandeur mixt with gentleness is seen  Where both agree with wide extended arms  To clasp the gazer to their mingled charms  The verdent velvet robe is cast above  As needless in the naked task of love  See see how fancy on that bed is caught  With all that Iris in her webb hath wrought  Where all the tints that in her loom delight  On yonder bank salute the raptur'd sight  The rainbow's radiance and commingled ray  In shining strata of refulgent clay  Seem emulous of that which reigns on high  Here Earth contends with beauties of the Sky  Th' inchanting slope with sweet attraction draws  The eager heart and yet it's ardour awes  As conscious of some wondrous scene behind  That with prodigious grandeur damp the mind  By some prophetic energy imprest  That from this specimen concludes the rest  And lo the outguards  Detach'd Rocks that have those appearances  fix'd that boldly brave  The storm indignant and the advancing wave  In hostile wise with sharpen'd spears they stand  Amid the floods at nature's great command  In postures changing as we draw more near  Like watchful warriors old implanted there  That face us various as we winding go  And challenge still and still arrest the foe  But see Lot's wife  One of the Rocks so called formerly but some Years ago gave way to a Tempest as particularly described by Mr STURCH in his view of the Isle of Wight to which this is submitted as no improper Companion  for fame has call'd her so  With stately stature and with robes that flow  Majestic lofty l  ke some sea born Queen  Adjust her tresses in the mirror green  Her tresses there assume the noblest forms  The rocks her toilet and her comb the storms  Her fashions are put on by nature's hand  And curls in characters unchanged stand  Now swallow'd up with greatness fear and joy  Let taste and wonder all the soul employ  Lo nature's hand hath here enormous wrought  Beyond the grasp of sense the reach of thought  Here awe struck reason must in silence pause  Lay down her scepter and suspend her laws  Unable on her gradual steps to climb  The dreadful summit of this vast sublime  How all impressions of the mind are chang'd  The heart distended and the head derang'd  The height above the wave fatigues the eye  For the strain'd nerve can scarcely reach so high  Above the proudest pitch of Roman style  Of Pompey's theatre or Trajan's pile  This awful edifice commands the waves  By nature built the boisterous billow braves  The God of ocean here his palace keeps  And sends his mandates o'er the distant deeps  The voice in eddies through the cliff is tost  And all the sense in half the space is lost  In half the space is mingled with the air  By echo's force annihilated there  Hark how the thunders of the exploding gun  That oft in loud prolific mazes stun  The ear beget a thousand vollies as they run  Whilst over head the concave seems alive  Like bees in millions swarming from the hive  The sea birds darken all the living space  That look no larger than the insect race  That wheel around disturb'd with clamours call  Or fall transfix'd increasing as they fall  Now whirling nearer to the impatient eye  They dash upon the wave and dashing die  Shooting the birds under the cliffs of Freshwater is a frequent diversionIt is described in the pamphlet before referred to with some humane reflectionsThe Editor attempts not to interpose an opinion on the practice but the sight of the cliffs and the vast number of birds is truly one of nature's curiosities  The billows bowing with profoundest sweep  Would pay their homage to the amazing steep  With grandeur rolling as they lofty climb  For every incident must be sublime  Now now through Galileo's orb we spy  These startled millions in their ranks on high  In stories rais'd with agitated breasts  Before the portals of their guarded nests  Tier above tier consulting in a fright  As erst the Roman capitol by night  How sweetly through the tellescope they shew  Their crimson heads erect and breasts of snow  In motion much disturb'd with troubled mind  Like roses ruffl'd by the invading wind  Till scar'd again no longer watch they keep  But sore aloft or dive into the deep  Or anxious flutter flapping feebly spring  From wave to wave upon the wounded wing  AGAIN we gaze again the soul we fill  Here all her faculties are feasted still  With true magnificence sublime and rare  And see a thousand guests the banquet share  A fleet of barks impatient pressing nigh  To view these wonders and the needles eye  Till sated with delight through that they sail  And give their canvass to the unwilling gale  Now round the island's rocky sides we row  Those towering rocks that like strong ramparts grow  That firm against the gallic inroads stand  These bulwarks rais'd by nature's hostile hand  That like the line of beauty waving rise  In lofty labyrinths to meet the skies  That awful frown with overlooking pride  Upon the subject beach and guarded tide  With rustic odours deck'd and high hung bloom  That all the rocks array the shores perfume  Where grandeur swells along the sounding length  Where fear with joy and beauty blends with strength  Extatic bliss now summer crowns the space  Like melted silver see the ocean's face  Lo rapture triumphs through the glad expanse  See glittering sun beams on the surface dance  Like nature's courtiers on some festal day  When calms consent and Phoebus weds the sea  The season now with transport charms the eye  And nature shifts the scene as we sail by  On every varying rock we fix the sight  The rock behind affords some new delight  Thus in some space by genius made alive  Some gallery where art and nature strive  Where wonders breathe along the living wall  And figures from the ceiling seem to fall  Detatch'd by art the force of shade and light  That menace from on high th' amazed sight  In rounded groupes successive still we view  Superior wonders and these wonders new  From form to form with wonder we survey  The magic labours of the massy way  The swelling figures and the shining coast  Till in the vast variety we're lost  Now echo empress of the cavern'd space  Returns our music with a rich increase  Our hearts beat time we quaff th' inchanting gales  We pity LEWIS and we scorn VERSAILLES  The sleeping surface unperceiv'd we plow  For time and space have lost their measure now  COWES CASTLE  Till STEEPHILL'S  A beautiful Villa of the Honourable Mr TOLLEMACHE  bending cliffs their pride display  And point the paradise at UNDERWAY  The intermediate tract of land between STEEPHILL cliffs and the sea shore is so called by the inhabitants The cliffs are a wonderful production of nature and wear the appearance of a regular wall the bold design and effect of indefatigable art They extend nearly four miles and the vale below is not only amazingly fertile but so various in its form and so interspersed with rocks of grotesque shape as the Poet has described it that the wildly pleasing and  ust are no where to be met with in mure happy combination To give a complete idea of these perfections would require the united powers of Claude Salvator and PoussinThe first should throw his delicate sunshine over the cultivated fields the scattered dots and hanging coppices The second should dash out the horror of the rugged cliffs steeps and ocean while the grand pencil of Poussin should crown the whole with the majesty of the impending mountainsThe Editor cannot help adding that a walk by moonlight at which time the many waterfalls are heared in all their variety of sounds in this inchanting situation opens a scene of such delicate beauty repose and solemnity as exceeds all description    Attention now begins once more to rise  And sated raptures yield to new surprise  Now now an aggregate unseen before  Of new rais'd wonders mantle all the shore  A miscellania fix'd and firm as fate  Of all that's beautiful of all that's great  Where all that nature to her children gives  Where health with plenty and enjoyment lives  Where elegance ascends th' enormous steep  With verdant robe and shades the distant deep  Here nature triumphs in her guarded ground  And fortifies the envy'd shores around  In angles bastions and in platforms cast  That ape the present and excel the past  Work above work like theatres they climb  With mirtle crown'd with wormwood and wild thyme  In mingled climax dubious they advance  That look like order now and now like chance  The ambitious cliff the crystal vault invades  Refresh'd by gushing springs and clear cascades  That murmuring down the craggy falls we hear  And feast the fancy through the astonish'd ear  The impatient fancy throbs for new delight  And now she banquets through the ravish'd sight  The rivulets see rushing from on high  That give such pleasure to the ear and eye  That through the grottos rocks and gardens glide  And the glad soul with sweet extreams divide  Extreams that with such grand confusion shine  Like chaos now and now a plan divine  How nature varies through the concave wide  And riots wanton with enormous pride  Behold a wall by nature's potent hand  Aloft o'er all th' extended outworks stand  Like centinels the extended outworks shew  To watch the motion of the flood below  In loose light troops the vagrant rocks appear  On wild excursion scatter'd here and there  Whilst all around within the intrenched space  See pleasure bloom and plenty mixt with grace  From pendant plots see nodding Caeres send  The pregnant ears that with the breezes bend  Their pondrous growth amidst the rocks on high  And with their tawny tinges charm the eye  There golden plenty on her throne is seen  And all the lawns pay homage to their queen  In  ributes array'd by wisdom's hands  Above the prostrate laws of vulgar lands  With majesty the wheaten groves appear  That look like prodigies implanted there  From forth the furrow rich the leveret see  Come hopping forward with exulting glee  Fearless of hounds a stranger to the cry  In full security he feeds on high  The pheasants here with happy freedom roam  From brake to brake amidst their native home  With peaceful leisure unalarm'd they spring  From tree to tree and wave the golden wing  The lark the thrush in loves sweet concerts call  Their mates among the murmuring rills that fall  From rock to rock whilst echo answers all  Can British taste the raptur'd scene forego  Where Pisgah's springs and Eden's fountains flow  Where nature's noblest growths the rocks adorn  With oaks with herbage and Sicilian corn  Where all the marvellous to mankind gives  With meek simplicity and order lives  Where health upon the hills the heart regales  And plenty wantons in the laughing vales  Where Epic composition seems to climb  Like Homer's Illiads to the last sublime  Where native grandeur reigns through every part  And looks with pity down on labouring art  What cultivated plans should here arise  What stately columns glitter in the skies  What rich rotundas on the rocks should shine  By Stanhope rais'd and Stuart's  James Stuart Esq commonly called Athaenian Stuart  hand divine  Mecaenas and Vitruvius here should tell  Where taste should flourish and where worth should dwell  When summer's ardent suns intensely press  To thoughtful coverts and to cool recess  Her grand campania Britain here should keep  Here wisdom should awake and faction sleep  Ambition here from racking dreams should rest  And envy quell the fury in her breast  In purest worth the patriot here should pride  And fling the foibles of the soul aside  Pure virtue here with nature should remain  And science o'er the peaceful province reign  The sons of genius here should hasty throng  The sons of picture and the sons of song  Here STUBBS and REYNOLDS should enrich their store  Here WILSON warm and BARRETT shine still more  Historic WEST should here inform the glade  Here ships and rocks for WRIGHT are ready made  Here GRAY that moral nightingale should sing  And friendly GOLDSMITH prune the travell'd wing  Soft MASON here might court the tragic queen  In British strains and raise the Attic scene  Nay AKENSIDE should here didactic glow  The fairest attitudes of things to shew  ARMSTRONG to rules of health here sweet perswade  Dispense his learning and destroy his trade  Diseases here on art but seldom call  Unfear'd an agueish Spring or sickly fall  But should the fiend in spite of nature's claim  Dare to approach and shake the human frame  Gentlemen of eminent knowledge and distinction in the Medical line in Newport  COWLAM'S or JOLLIFFE'S or young BASSETT'S care  Would soon the temporary ill repair  Here SHARP his native note should raptur'd raise  In freedom's contest and in Vecta's praise  His country's charms should all his fancy fire  Should all his virtue all his verse inspire  To truth attach'd to patriot truth still dear  In action faithful and in word sincere  His happy talents at this mark still aim  On public worth to build his private fame  THRICE happy bard in fortune's arms caress'd  By virtue shielded and by beauty blest  Thy finish'd bliss can feel no feign'd alloy  The chaste Cleora crowns thy perfect joy  And see the pledges of your rapture rise  Like tendril vines beneath indulgent skies  Whose genial dews call forth the branch to grow  The bloom to brighten and the blossom blow  Whilst time in season shall the fruit display  With ripening blush and your soft toil repay  On yon tall cliff whose brows o'erlook the deep  True taste shall soon her polish'd mansion keep  Thither shall connoisseurs in crowds repair  Another TUSCULUM shall flourish there  There British TULLYS BACONS shall arise  At once be happy and at once be wise  There awful nature civiliz'd by art  Shall win at once the head and charm the heart  There Greece and Rome shall deck the ample space  With HOMER'S grandeur and with VIRGIL'S grace  The chizel and the pencil there shall strive  To make the cieling and the walls alive  The peopled canvass shall the sight surprize  And the rough rocks in human shapes shall rise  The beauteous savage shall with social air  Another Athens on the hills appear  That to the clouds her comely head shall raise  And on her image in the ocean gaze  The ocean at her feet shall silent sleep  And boast the picture in the polish'd deep  The sun unheeded in his prone decline  We feast abstracted on the scene divine  And turning oft with pausing fond delay  We bid a sweet farewell to  Underway  Whilst deep engrav'd reflection long shall find  The groupe immense within th' expanded mind  Impress'd in images sublime and fair  Which mimic fancy oft retraces there  O'er hills o'er vallies we alternate go  Like basons fill'd with gems the vallies shew  With gardens rich replete with Sylvan domes  Where health and pleasure keep their happy homes  Again we climb the rich inviting hill  Again the same glad scenes salute us still  That still new tribute from our wonder claim  Another paradise and yet the same  Tho' still enrich'd with something grand and new  Some rock in prospect o'er the ocean blue  Some stately steeple in it's ivy vest  By frolic time in different mantles drest  That like some gothic king by turrets crown'd  Reigns o'er the farms and villages around  Through farms and villages we joyful ride  Where British Ceres in her Indian pride  With ripening plenty loads the shelving field  The reaper here can scarce his sickle wield  Incumber'd by the blessings thick at hand  Of heaven's indulgence' and the fruitful land  The farmer views the oppressive crops with pride  And bids his garners and his heart grow wide  There Neptune's throne  Commonly called Shanklin Chine  attracts the ambitious eye  That bears upon it's breast the incumbent sky  That all the greedy soul with transport fills  The boundless ocean and the sky kiss'd hills  By turns sollicit the divided sight  By turns amaze us and by turns delight  With arduous steps impatient now we climb  With panting hearts we view the scene sublime  Where pleasure meets with health where both combine  To quaff the gale and view the amazing chine  THE monarch of the main from his high car  Beheld this proud phaenomenon from far  Whose swelling cliffs their dubious heads advance  Where nature seems to steal the sketch from chance  And art to mingle both with plastic hand  So regularly wild these wonders stand  In heterogeneous piles that strong impart  The grand coincidence of chance and art  The God of ocean saw this scene with pride  And rushing hasty on a high spring tide  The waves at once their monarch's voice obey  The surge assaults the cliff the cliff gives way  His lifted trident with one stroke divine  Cleaves the vast rock and forms the wond'rous chine  A dread abrupt deep rends the groaning hill  With yawn terrific at great Neptune's will  A thousand stately forms their pride disclose  And groves and grottos in an instant rose  With copious caverns and with sounding rills  That all the echoing space responsive fills  The waves rush in the winds exulting roar  The ocean triumphs on the alter'd shore  Then spoke the God who rules th' alternate tide  Let all my vital virtues here preside  My healing essence in each wave abound  Breathe in the air and brood upon the ground  Let here disease within my bosom find  Strength to the nerve and vigour to the mind  Let thousands here in thankful throngs resort  With votive offerings to my sacred court  Here here high fix the tablet of their vows  As at my other sacred  ane at Cowes  For here my court shall all the main command  My trident here and here my car shall stand  My throne I'll raise on you celestial down  There wield my scepter and there fix my crown  END OF THE SECOND CANTO  CANTO III  AMID

navigation loiters on the tide  To gaze on nature's charms from side to side  That plows with double appetite the flood  For private pleasure and for public good  This other Thames whose banks with plenty smile  This Thames in little and this narrow Nile  By nature's hand entic'd by beauty led  Along the windings of it's fruitful bed  Equal to Nile and Thames for fertile grace  It gains in beauty what it wants in space  The seaman ravish'd by the hills and plains  Pursues his pleasure and forgets his gains  The helm let go he gazes all around  He dreads no lurking rock or dangerous ground  Rich profit here and rapture hand in hand  Allure each other and the soul command  The swelling bounty Neptune's chariot rides  On teeming billows and alternate tides  Lo Whippinghamhill the muse must long command  Fair object of the variegated land  What mingled beauties strike the ravish'd sight  Here contemplation feels supreme delight  Doats on the prospect that it's summit shows  While stretch'd around the purple harvest glows  And there the herd are at their ease reclin'd  While see beneath the glassy river wind  Yon clumps of trees that in perspective bend  A verdant amphitheatre extend  The setting ray adds grandeur to the scene  Plays o'er the Spire  Whippingham Steeple  and trembles on the green  Sparkles thro' waving leaves mild lustre round  And gilds the atmosphere's extremest bound  Capacious COWES thy hospitable port  Where Neptune sleeps where safety holds her court  Around thy sleets it's strong protection throws  And storms and tempests are in vain thy foes  All nature's war within thy arms must cease  Thy sheltering bosom is the throne of peace  Creation flings her fences round thy shore  And chaos where they rise can rage no more  The different winds that war in this agree  To send by every storm rich freights to thee  Thy wide spread arms with universal grace  Takes in the south the north at one embrace  The east the west with every part of space  Whilst loaded ships securely come and go  Nor heed the scanty ebb nor copious flow  Here time and Neptune wait upon each bark  Her pilot safety through the thickest dark  To thy embrace through night's black cope they run  Secure as lighted by the noonday sun  Here Europe's terror and Britannia's pride  The world's great terror can with fafety ride  Here George's thunder unprovok'd may sleep  Rock'd by the swellings of the subject deep  On thy soft bosom peace may here repose  Whilst France and whirlwinds are in vain it's foes  SEE ruddy health with naked bosom stand  On yonder cliff and wave the vigorous hand  Above the banks with florid cheeks that glow  Pointing triumphant at the tide below  Commodious and elegant Preparations are made there for the Benefit of Bathing in the Tides    The pregnant tide with healing power replete  Where health where vigour and where pleasure meet  Here ocean's breath comes mingled with the breeze  And drives far off the bloated fiend disease  Here oceans balm the sinking heart delights  And drooping Britain to the shore invites  His essence here shall energetic glow  And health and spirits on her sons bestow  Her beautious offspring on the bank shall smile  And bless the breezes of MEDINA'S isle  Here ocean's essence unpoluted reigns  From nature's vitals and from Neptune's veins  Here lusty health comes rushing day and night  Unmix'd as truth and clear as morning light  No foul infection mingles with the tide  In healing virtue pure and virgin pride  Along the tented shore shall beauty skim  The bosom bright shall lave the lovely limb  New kindled orbs shall strike with sweet surprize  As stars relumin'd from the ocean rise  No more to foreign baths shall Britain roam  But plunge at Cowes and find rich health at home  Thither shall merit and shall beauty throng  Proclaim it's worth and vindicate my song  Through future times the raptur'd muse can see  What years unborn shall joyful bring to thee  Thy crowded ports with trade shall rich run o'er  And stately structures glitter on thy shore  The world shall find thee and with wonder tell  That Vecta's shining scenes the world excel  Thou precious cabinet where nature locks  Her richest gems within thy beauteous rocks  Thou casket fill'd with all her choicest store  Of matter freely but of fancy more  The muse prophetic shall thy bliss foretel  And on that theme with raptur'd note shall dwell  Concord shall here assume the social smile  And envy fade and faction fly the isle  Friendship and virtue shall thy sons unite  Discord shall die and harmony delight  Firm loyalty and truth shall bless the land  And health shall crown and  Holmes  Leonard Troughear Holmes Esq of Westover Lodge Successor to the late Lord Holmes who died Governor of the Island in  shall lead the band  FINIS
