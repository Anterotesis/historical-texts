pass'd on this Sermon by your unanimous Request to have it sent to the Press which I have done without  sending any Apology along with it for  ts Unfitness to appear in PublicEx  uses of this Kind being generally so well known both as to Substance and Form that it is altogether unnecessary to copy them  I will therefore only beg your favourable Acceptance of it and to believe That tho' my chief View in complying with your Desire was the Hopes of doing Good by contributing something to the Interests of Religion and Morality yet it is no small Pleasure which I receive at the same Time from the Opportunity it gives me of declaring how great an Honour and Esteem I have for so many Gentlemen of Worth and Character I am  Your most humble And most obedient Servant L STERNE  HEBREWS xiii  For we trust we have a good Conscience  _TRUSTTrust we have a good ConscienceSurely you will say if there is any Thing in this Life which a Man may depend upon and to the Knowledge of which he is capable of arriving upon the most indisputable Evidence it must be this very ThingWhether he has a good Conscience or no  If a Man thinks at all he cannot well be a Stranger to the true State of this AccountHe must be privy to his own Thoughts and DesiresHe must  remember his past Pursuits and know certainly the true Springs and Motives which in general have govern'd the Actions of his Life  In other Matters we may be deceiv'd by false Appearances and as the Wise Man complains  Hardly do we guess aright at the Things that are upon the Earth and with Labour do we find the Things that are before us  But here the Mind has all the Evidence and Facts within herselfIs conscious of the Web she has woveKnows its Texture and Fineness and the exact Share which every Passion has had in working upon the several Designs which Virtue or Vice has plann'd before her  Nowas Conscience is nothing else but the Knowledge which the Mind has within itself of this and the Judgment either of Approbation or Censure which it unavoidably makes upon the successive Actions of our Lives'tis plain you will say from the very  Terms of the Proposition Whenever this inward Testimony goes against a Man and he stands selfaccusedthat he must necessarily be a  guilty Man  And on the contrary When the Report is favourable on his Side and his Heart condemns him notthat it is not a Matter of  Trust  as the Apostle intimates but a Matter of Certainty and Fact that the  Conscience  is  good  and that the  Man  must be  good  also  At first Sight this may seem to be a true State of the Case and I make no Doubt but the Knowledge of Right and Wrong is so truly impress'd upon the Mind of Man that did no such Thing ever happen as that the Conscience of a Man by long Habits of Sin might as the Scripture assures us it may insensibly become hard and like some tenderer Parts of his Body by much Stress and continual hard Usage lose by Degrees that nice Sense and Perception with which God and Nature endowed itDid this never happenOr  was it certain that SelfLove could never hang the least Bias upon the JudgmentOr that the Little Interests below could rise up and perplex the Faculties of our upper Regions and encompass him about with Clouds and thick DarknessCould no such Thing as Favour and Affection enter this sacred CourtDid WIT disdain to take a Bribe in it or was ashamed to shew its Face as an Advocate for an unwarrantable EnjoymentOr lastly were we assured that INTEREST stood always unconcern'd whilst the Cause was hearingand that PASSION never got into the Judgment Seat and pronounced Sentence in the Stead of Reason which is supposed always to preside and determine upon the CaseWas this truly so as the Objection must suppose no Doubt then the Religious and Moral State of a Man would be exactly what He himself esteemed it and the Guilt or Innocence of every Man's Life could be known in general by no better Measure than  the Degrees of his own Approbation or Censure  I own in one Case whenever a Man's Conscience does accuse him as it seldom errs on that Side that he is Guilty and unless in melancholy and hypochondriac Cases we may safely pronounce upon that there is always sufficient Grounds for the Accusation  But the Converse of the Proposition will not hold truenamely That wherever there is Guilt the Conscience must accuse and if it does not that a Man is therefore InnocentThis is not FactSo that the common Consolation which some good Christian or other is hourly administring to himselfThat he thanks God his Mind does not misgive him and that consequently he has a good Conscience because he has a quiet oneAs current as the Inference is and as infallible as the Rule appears at first Sight yet when you look nearer to it and try the Truth of this Rule  upon plain Facts you find it liable to so much Error from a false Application of itThe Principle on which it goes so often pervertedThe whole Force of it lost and sometimes so vilely cast away that it is painful to produce the common Examples from human Life which confirm this Account  A Man shall be vicious and utterly debauched in his Principles exceptionable in his Conduct to the World shall live shamelessin the open Commission of a Sin which no Reason or Pretence can justifya Sin by which contrary to all the Workings of Humanity within he shall ruin for ever the deluded Partner of his Guiltrob her of her best Dowryand not only cover her own Head with Dishonour but involve a whole virtuous Family in Shame and Sorrow for her Sake Surelyyou'll think Conscience must lead such a Man a troublesome LifeHe can have no Rest Night or Day from its Reproaches  Alas Conscience had something else to do all this Time than break in upon him As  Elijah  reproached the God  Baal  this  Domestic God  was either  talking or pursuing or was in a Journey or peradventure he slept and could not be awoke  Perhaps he was gone out in Company with HONOUR to fight a Duelto pay off some Debt at Playor dirty Annuity the Bargain of his LustPerhaps Conscience all this Time was engaged at home talking aloud against petty Larceny and executing Vengeance upon such puny Crimes as his Fortune and Rank in Life secured him against all Temptation of committingSo that he lives as merrilysleeps as soundly in his Bedand at the last meets Death with as much Unconcernednessperhaps much more so than a much better Man  Another is sordid unmercifulA straithearted selfish Wretch incapable either of private Friendships or  public SpiritTake Notice how he passes by the Widow and Orphan in their Distress and sees all the Miseries incident to human Life without a Sigh or a PrayerShall not Conscience rise up and sting him on such Occasions NoThank God there is no Occasion  'I pay every Man his ownI have no Fornication to answer to my Conscience no faithless Vows or Promises to make up I have debauch'd no Man's Wife or ChildThank God I am not as other Men Adulterers Unjust or even as this Libertine who stands before me'  A Third is crafty and designing in his NatureView his whole Life'Tis nothing else but a cunning Contexture of dark Arts and unequitable Subterfuges basely to defeat the true Intent of all Laws plain Dealing and the safe Enjoyment of our several PropertiesYou will see such a one working out a Frame of little Designs upon the Ignorance and Perplexities of the poor and needy ManShall raise  a Fortune upon the Inexperience of a Youthor the unsuspecting Temper of his Friend who would have trusted him with his Life When old Age comes on and Repentance calls him to look back upon this black Account and state it over again with his ConscienceConscience looks into the  Statutes at Large  finds perhaps no  express Law  broken by what he has doneperceives no Penalty or Forfeiture incurr'dsees no Scourge waving over his Heador Prison opening its Gate upon himWhat is there to affright his ConscienceConscience has got safely entrench'd behind the Letter of the Law sits there invulnerable fortified with  Cases  and  Reports  so strongly on all Sidesthat 'tis not Preaching can dispossess it of its Hold  Another shall want even this Refugeshall break thro' all this Ceremony of slow Chicane scorns the doubtful Workings of secret Plots and cautious Trains to bring about his PurposeSee  the barefac'd Villain how he cheats lyes perjures robs murdersHorrid But indeed much better was not to be expected in this CaseThe poor Man was in the darkHis Priest had got the keeping of his Conscienceand all he had let him know of it was That he must believe in the  Pope  Go to MassCross himselftell his Beadsbe a good Catholic and that this in all Conscience was enough to carry him to Heaven WhatIf he perjuresWhyHe had a mental Reservation in it But if he is so wicked and abandoned a Wretch as you represent himIf he robs or murders will not Conscience on every such Act receive a Wound itselfAyBut the Man has carried it to Confession the Wound digests there and will do well enoughand in a short Time be quite healed up by Absolution  O  Popery  What hast thou to answer forwhen not content with the  too many natural and fatal Ways thro' which the Heart is every Day thus treacherous to itself above all ThingsThou hast wilfully set open this wide Gate of Deceit before the Face of this unwary  Traveller  too apt God knows to go astray of himselfand confidently speak Peace to his Soul when there is no Peace  Of this the common Instances which I have drawn out of Life are too notorious to require much Evidence If any Man doubts the Reality of them or thinks it impossible for Man to be such a Bubble to himselfI must refer him a Moment to his Reflections and shall then venture to trust the Appeal with his own Heart Let him consider in how different a Degree of Detestation Numbers of wicked Actions stand  there  tho' equally bad and vicious in their own NaturesHe will soon find that such of them as strong Inclination or Custom have prompted him to commit are generally dress'd out and painted  with all the false Beauties which a soft and flattering Hand can give them and that the others to which he feels no Propensity appear at once naked and deformed surrounded with all the true Circumstances of Folly and Dishonour  When  David  surprized  Saul  sleeping in the Cave and cut off the Skirt of his Robewe read his Heart smote him for what he had doneBut in the Matter of  Uriah  where a faithful and gallant Servant whom he ought to have lov'd and honour'd fell to make Way for his Lust where  Conscience  had so much greater Reason to take the Alarmhis Heart smote him notA whole Year had almost passed from the first Commission of that Crimeto the Time  Nathan  was sent to reprove him and we read not once of the least Sorrow or Compunction of Heart which he testified during all that Time for what he had done  Thus Conscience this once able Monitorplaced on high as a Judge within usand intended by our Maker as a just and equitable one tooby an unhappy Train of Causes and Impedimentstakes often such imperfect Cognizance of what passesdoes its Office so negligentlysometimes so corruptly that it is not to be trusted alone And therefore we find there is a Necessity an absolute Necessity of joining another Principle with it to aid if not govern its Determinations  So that if you would form a just Judgment of what is of infinite Importance to you not to be misled in namely in what Degree of real Merit you stand either as an honest Manan useful Citizena faithful Subject to your Kingor a good Servant to your Godcall in RELIGION and MORALITYLookWhat is written in the Law of GodHow readest thouConsult calm Reason and the unchangeable Obligations  of Justice and TruthWhat say they  Let Conscience determine the Matter upon these Reportsand then if  thy Heart condemn thee not  which is the Case the Apostle supposesthe Rule will be infallible  Thou wilt have Confidence towards God  that is have just Grounds to believe the Judgment thou hast past upon thyself  is  the Judgment of God and nothing else but an Anticipation of that righteous Sentence which will be pronounced hereafter upon thee by that BEING before whom thou art finally to give an Account of thy Actions  Blessed is the Man  indeed then as the Author of the Book of  Ecclesiasticus  expresses it  Who is not pricked with the Multitude of his SinsBlessed is the Man whose Heart hath not condemned him and who is not fallen from his Hope in the Lord Whether he be rich  continues he  or whether he be  poorif he have a good Heart  a Heart thus guided and inform'd  He shall at all Times rejoice in a chearful Countenance    His Mind shall tell him more than seven Watchmen that sit above upon a Tower on high  In the darkest Doubts it shall conduct him safer than a thousand Casuists and give the State he lives in a better Security for his Behaviour than all the Clauses and Restrictions put together which the Wisdom of the Legislature is forced to multiplyforced I say as Things stand human Laws being not a Matter of original Choice but of pure Necessity brought in to fence against the mischievous Effects of those Consciences which are no Law unto themselves Wisely intending by the many Provisions made That in all such corrupt or misguided Cases where Principle and the Checks of Conscience will not make us uprightto supply their Force and by the Terrors of Jails and Halters oblige us to it  To have the Fear of God before our Eyes and in our mutual Dealings with each other to govern our Actions by the eternal Measures of Right and WrongThe first of these will comprehend the Duties of Religion The second those of Morality which are so inseparably connected together that you cannot divide these two  Tables  even in Imagination tho' the Attempt is often made in Practice without breaking and mutually destroying them both  I said the Attempt is often madeand so it isthere being nothing more common than to see a Man who has no Sense at all of Religionand indeed has  so much  of Honesty as to pretend to none who would yet take it as the bitterest Affront should you but hint at a Suspicion of his Moral Characteror imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to the uttermost Mite  When there is some Appearance that it is sotho' one is not willing even to suspect the Appearance of so great a Virtue as moral Honestyyet were we to look into the Grounds of it in the present Case I am persuaded we should find little Reason to envy such a Man the Honour of his Motive  Let him declaim as pompously as he can on the Subject it will be found at last to rest upon no better Foundation than either his Interest his Pride his Ease or some such little and changeable Passion as will give us but small Dependence upon his Actions in Matters of great Stress  Give me Leave to illustrate this by an Example  I know the Banker I deal with or the Physician I usually call in to be neither of them Men of much Religion I hear them make a Jest of it every  Day and treat all its Sanctions with so much Scorn and Contempt as to put the Matter past Doubt Wellnotwithstanding this I put my Fortune into the Hands of the oneand what is dearer still to me I trust my Life to the honest Skill of the otherNow let me examine what is my Reason for this great ConfidenceWhyin the first Place I believe there is no Probability that either of them will employ the Power I put into their Hands to my Disadvantage I consider that Honesty serves the Purposes of this LifeI know their Success in the World depends upon the Fairness of their Charactersthat they cannot hurt me without hurting themselves more  But put it otherwise namely that Interest lay for once on the other SideThat a Case should happen wherein the one without Stain to his Reputation could secrete my Fortune and leave me naked in the WorldOr  that the Other could send me out of it and enjoy an Estate by my Death without Dishonour to himself or his ArtIn this Case what Hold have I of either of themReligion the strongest of all Motives is out of the QuestionInterest the next most powerful Motive in this World is strongly against meI have nothing left to cast into the Scale to ballance this TemptationI must lay at the Mercy of Honouror some such capricious PrincipleStrait Security for two of my best and most valuable Blessingsmy Property and my Life  As therefore we can have no Dependence upon Morality without Religionso on the other Hand there is nothing better to be expected from Religion without Morality nor can any Man be suppos'd to discharge his Duties to God whatever fair Appearances he may hang out that he does so if he does not pay as conscientious a Regard  to the Duties which he owes his FellowCreature  This is a Point capable in itself of strict DemonstrationNevertheless 'tis no Rarity to see a Man whose real moral Merit stands very low who yet entertains the highest Notion of himself in the Light of a devout and religious Man He shall not only be covetous revengeful implacablebut even wanting in Points of common HonestyYet because he talks loud against the Infidelity of the Ageis zealous for some Points of Religiongoes twice a Day to Churchattends the Sacramentsand amuses himself with a few Instrumental Duties of Religionshall cheat his Conscience into a Judgment that for this he is a religious Man and has discharged faithfully his Duty to God And you will find that such a Man thro' Force of this Delusion generally looks down with Spiritual Pride upon every other Man who has less  Affectation of Piety tho' perhaps ten Times more moral Honesty than himself  This is likewise a sore Evil under the Sun  and I believe there is no one mistaken Principle which for its Time has wrought more serious Mischiefs For a general Proof of thisexamine the History of the  Romish  ChurchSee what Scenes of Cruelty Murders Rapines Bloodshed have all been sanctified by a Religion not strictly governed by Morality  In how many Kingdoms of the World has the crusading Sword of this misguided SaintErrant spared neither Age or Merit or Sex or ConditionAnd as he fought under the Banners of a Religion which set him loose from Justice and Humanityhe shewed nonemercilessly trampled upon both heard neither the Cries of the Unfortunate nor pitied their Distresses  If the Testimony of past Centuries in this Matter is not sufficientconsider at this Instant how the Votaries of that Religion are every Day thinking to do Service and Honour to God by Actions which are a Dishonour and Scandal to themselves  To be convinced of this go with me for a Moment into the Prisons of the InquisitionBehold  Religion  with Mercy and Justice chain'd down under her Feetthere sitting ghastly upon a black Tribunal propp'd up with Racks and Instruments of TormentHarkWhat a piteous GroanSee the melancholy Wretch who utter'd it just brought forth to undergo the Anguish of a MockTrial and endure the utmost Pains that a studied System of  religious Cruelty  has been able to invent Behold this helpless Victim delivered up to his Tormentors His Body so wasted with Sorrow and long Confinement you'll see every Nerve and  Muscle as it suffersObserve the last Movement of that horrid EngineWhat Convulsions it has thrown him intoConsider the Nature of the Posture in which he now lies stretch'dWhat exquisite Torture he endures by it'Tis all Nature can bearGood God See how it keeps his weary Soul hanging upon his trembling Lips willing to take its Leavebut cruelly not suffer'd to depart Behold the unhappy Wretch led back to his Celldragg'd out of it again to meet the Flamesand the Insults in his last Agonies which this PrincipleThis Principle that there  can  be Religion without Morality has prepared for him  The surest Way to try the Merit of any disputed Notionis to trace down the Consequences such a Notion has produced and compare them with the  Spirit  of Christianity'Tis the short and decisive Rule which our Saviour  has left for these and such like Casesand is worth a thousand Arguments  By their Fruits  says he  ye shall know them  Thus Religion and Morality like fast Friends and natural Allies can never be set at Variance without the mutual Ruin and Dishonour of them bothand whoever goes about this unfriendly Office is no Wellwisher to eitherand whatever he pretends he deceives his own Heart and I fear his Morality as well as his Religion will be vain  I will add no farther to the Length of this Discourse than by two or three short and independent Rules deducible from what has been said    st  Whenever a Man talks loudly against Religion always suspect that it is not his Reason but his Passions which have got the Better of his Creed  A  bad Life  and a  good Belief  are disagreeable and troublesome Neighbours and where they separate depend upon it 'tis for no other Cause but Quietness Sake    dly  When a Man thus represented tells you in any particular Instance that such a Thing goes  against  his Consciencealways believe he means exactly the same Thing as when he tells you such a Thing goes against his Stomacha present Want of Appetite being generally the true se of both  In a Wordtrust the Man in nothingwho has not a Conscience in every Thing  And in your own Case remember this plain Distinction a Mistake in which has ruin'd ThousandsThat your Conscience is not a LawnoGod and Reason made the Law and has placed Conscience within you to determinenot like an  Asiatic Cadi  according  to the Ebbs and Flows of his own PassionsBut like a  British Judge  in this Land of Liberty who makes no new Lawbut faithfully declares that glorious Law which he finds already written  FINIS  By  same AUTHOR The
