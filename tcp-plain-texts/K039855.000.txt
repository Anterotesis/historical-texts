AT HORACE'S HEAD FLEET STREET MDCCLXXXIX  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Author of the following Letters takes the liberty with all proper deference of laying before the public his idea of  parochial history  which he thinks ought to consist of natural productions and occurrences as well as antiquities He is also of opinion that if stationary men would pay some attention to the districts on which they reside and would publish their thoughts respecting the objects that surround them from such materials might be drawn the most complete countyhistories which are still wanting in several parts of this kingdom and in particular in the county of  Southampton  And here he seizes the first opportunity though a late one of returning his most grateful acknowledgments to the reverend the President and the reverend and worthy the Fellows of  Magdalen College  in the university of  Oxford  for their liberal behaviour in permitting their archives to be searched by a member of their own society so far as the  evidences therein contained might respect the parish and priory of  Selborne  To that gentleman also and his assistant whose labours and attention could only be equalled by the very kind manner in which they were bestowed many and great obligations are also due  Of the authenticity of the documents abovementioned there can be no doubt since they consist of the identical deeds and records that were removed to the College from the Priory at the time of it's dissolution and being carefully copied on the spot may be depended on as genuine and never having been made public before may gratify the curiosity of the antiquary as well as establish the credit of the history  If the writer should at all appear to have induced any of his readers to pay a more ready attention to the wonders of the Creation too frequently overlooked as common occurrences or if he should by any means through his researches have lent an helping hand towards the enlargement of the boundaries of historical and topographical knowledge or if he should have thrown some small light upon ancient customs and manners and especially on those that were monastic his purpose will be fully answered But if he should not have been successful in any of these his intentions  yet there remains this consolation behindthat these his pursuits by keeping the body and mind employed have under Providence contributed to much health and cheerfulness of spirits even to old age and what still adds to his happiness have led him to the knowledge of a circle of gentlemen whose intelligent communications as they have afforded him much pleasing information so could he flatter himself with a continuation of them would they ever be deemed a matter of singular satisfaction and improvement  GIL WHITE

aspera montuosa fidelis simplex fautrix suorum regio  Cicero Orat pro Cn Plancio  THE NATURAL HISTORY OF SELBORNE  LETTER I TO THOMAS PENNANT ESQUIRE  THE parish of SELBORNE lies in the extreme eastern corner of the county of  Hampshire  bordering on the county of  Sussex  and not far from the county of  Surrey  is about fifty miles southwest of  London  in latitude and near midway between the towns of  Alton  and  Petersfield  Being very large and extensive it abuts on twelve parishes two of which are in  Sussex  viz  Trotton  and  Rogate  If you begin from the south and proceed westward the adjacent parishes are  Emshot Newton Valence Faringdon Harteley Mauduit Great Ward le ham Kingsley Hedleigh Bramshot Trotton Rogate Lysse  and  Greatham  The soils of this district are almost as various and diversified as the views and aspects The high part to the southwest consists of a vast hill of chalk rising three  hundred feet above the village and is divided into a sheep down the high wood and a long hanging wood called  The Hanger  The covert of this eminence is altogether beech the most lovely of all forest trees whether we consider it's smooth rind or bark it's glossy foliage or graceful pendulous boughs The down or sheepwalk is a pleasing parklike spot of about one mile by half that space jutting out on the verge of the hillcountry where it begins to break down into the plains and commanding a very engaging view being an assemblage of hill dale woodlands heath and water The prospect is bounded to the southeast and east by the vast range of mountains called  The Sussex Downs  by  Guilddown  near  Guildford  and by the  Downs  round  Dorking  and  Ryegate  in  Surrey  to the northeast which altogether with the country beyond  Alton  and  Farnham  form a noble and extensive outline  At the foot of this hill one stage or step from the uplands lies the village which consists of one single straggling street three quarters of a mile in length in a sheltered vale and running parallel with  The Hanger  The houses are divided from the hill by a vein of stiff clay good wheatland yet stand on a rock of white stone little in appearance removed from chalk but seems so far from being calcarious that it endures extreme heat Yet that the freestone still preserves somewhat that is analogous to chalk is plain from the beeches which descend as low as those rocks extend and no farther and thrive as well on them where the ground is steep as on the chalks  The cartway of the village divides in a remarkable manner two very incongruous soils To the southwest is a rank clay that requires the labour of years to render it mellow while the gardens to the northeast and small enclosures behind consist of a  warm forward crumbling mould called  black malm  which seems highly saturated with vegetable and animal manure and these may perhaps have been the original site of the town while the woods and coverts might extend down to the opposite bank  At each end of the village which runs from southeast to northwest arises a small rivulet that at the northwest end frequently fails but the other is a fine perennial spring little influenced by drought or wet seasons called  Wellhead  This spring produced  September  after a severe hot summer and a preceding dry spring and winter nine gallons of water in a minute which is five hundred and forty in an hour and twelve thousand nine hundred and sixty or two hundred and sixteen hogsheads in twentyfour hours or one natural day At this time many of the wells failed and all the ponds in the vales were dry  This breaks out of some high grounds joining to  Nore Hill  a noble chalk promontory remarkable for sending forth two streams into two different seas The one to the south becomes a branch of the  Arun  running to  Arundel  and so falling into the  British  channel the other to the north The  Selborne  stream makes one branch of the  Wey  and meeting the  Blackdown  stream at  Hedleigh  and the  Alton  and  Farnham  stream at  Tilfordbridge  swells into a considerable river navigable at  Godalming  from whence it passes to  Guildford  and so into the  Thames  at  Weybridge  and thus at the  Nore  into the  German  ocean  Our wells at an average run to about sixtythree feet and when sunk to that depth seldon fail but produce a fine limpid water soft to the taste and much commended by those who drink the pure element but which does not lather well with soap  To the northwest north and east of the village is a range of fair enclosures consisting of what is called a  white malm  a sort of  rotten or rubble stone which when turned up to the frost and rain moulders to pieces and becomes manure to itself  This soil produces good wheat and clover    Still on to the northeast and a step lower is a kind of white land neither chalk nor clay neither fit for pasture nor for the plough yet kindly for hops which root deep into the freestone and have their poles and wood for charcoal growing just at hand This white soil produces the brightest hops  As the parish still inclines down towards  Wolmerforest  at the juncture of the clays and sand the soil becomes a wet sandy loam remarkable for timber and infamous for roads The oaks of  Temple  and  Blackmoor  stand high in the estimation of purveyors and have furnished much naval timber while the trees on the freestone grow large but are what workmen call  shakey  and so brittle as often to fall to pieces in sawing Beyond the sandy loam the soil becomes an hungry lean sand till it mingles with the forest and will produce little without the assistance of lime and turnips  LETTER II TO THE SAME  IN the court of  Norton  farm house a manor farm to the northwest of the village on the white malms stood within these twenty years a  broadleaved elm  or  wych hazel ulmus folio latissimo scabro  of  Ray  which though it had lost a considerable leading  bough in the great storm in the year equal to a moderate tree yet when felled contained eight loads of timber and being too bulky for a carriage was sawn off at seven feet above the butt where it measured near eight feet in the diameter This elm I mention to shew to what a bulk  planted elms  may attain as this tree must certainly have been such from it's situation  In the centre of the village and near the church is a square piece of ground surrounded by houses and vulgarly called  The Plestor  Vide the plate in the antiquities  In the midst of this spot stood in old times a vast oak with a short squat body and huge horizontal arms extending almost to the extremity of the area This venerable tree surrounded with stone steps and seats above them was the delight of old and young and a place of much resort in summer evenings where the former sat in grave debate while the latter frolicked and danced before them Long might it have stood had not the amazing tempest in overturned it at once to the infinite regret of the inhabitants and the vicar who bestowed several pounds in setting it in it's place again but all his care could not avail the tree sprouted for a time then withered and died This oak I mention to shew to what a bulk  planted oaks  also may arrive and planted this tree must certainly have been as will appear from what will be said farther concerning this area when we enter on the antiquities of  Selborne  On the  Blackmoor  estate there is a small wood called  Losel  's of a few acres that was lately furnished with a set of oaks of a peculiar growth and great value they were tall and taper like firs but standing near together had very small heads only a little brush without any large limbs About twenty years ago the  bridge at the  Toy  near  Hampton Court  being much decayed some trees were wanted for the repairs that were fifty feet long without bough and would measure twelve inches diameter at the little end Twenty such trees did a purveyor find in this little wood with this advantage that many of them answered the description at sixty feet These trees were sold for twenty pounds apiece  In the centre of this grove there stood an oak which though shapely and tall on the whole bulged out into a large excrescence about the middle of the stem On this a pair of ravens had fixed their residence for such a series of years that the oak was distinguished by the title of  The Raventree  Many were the attempts of the neighbouring youths to get at this  eyry  the difficulty whetted their inclinations and each was ambitious of surmounting the arduous task But when they arrived at the swelling it jutted out so in their way and was so far beyond their grasp that the most daring lads were awed and acknowledged the undertaking to be too hazardous So the ravens built on nest upon nest in perfect security till the fatal day arrived in which the wood was to be levelled It was in the month of  February  when those birds usually sit The saw was applied to the butt the wedges were inserted into the opening the woods echoed to the heavy blows of the beetle or mallet the tree nodded to it's fall but still the dam sat on At last when it gave way the bird was flung from her nest and though her parental affection deserved a better fate was whipped down by the twigs which brought her dead to the ground  depiction of a fossil  Pl III Pa  MYTILUS Crista Galli  Published    by B White  LETTER III TO THE SAME  THE fossilshells of this district and sorts of stone such as have fallen within my observation must not be passed over in silence And first I must mention as a great curiosity a specimen that was plowed up in the chalky fields near the side of the  Down  and given to me for the singularity of it's appearance which to an incurious eye seems like a petrified fish of about four inches long the cardo passing for an head and mouth It is in reality a  bivalve  of the  Linnaean Genus  of  Mytilus  and the species of  Crista Galli  called by  Lister Rastellum  by  Rumphius Ostreum plicatum minus  by  D'Argenville Auris Porci  s  Crista Galli  and by those who make collections  cock's comb  Though I applied to several such in London I never could meet with an entire specimen nor could I ever find in books any engraving from a perfect one In the superb  museum  at  Leicesterhouse  permission was given me to examine for this article and though I was disappointed as to the fossil I was highly gratified with the sight of several of the shells themselves in high preservation This bivalve is only known to inhabit the  Indian  ocean where it fixes itself to a  zoophyte  known by the name  Gorgonia  The curious foldings of the suture the one into the other the alternate flutings or grooves and the curved form of my specimen being much easier expressed by the pencil than by words I have caused it to be drawn and engraved  Cornua Ammonis  are very common about this village As we were cutting an inclining path up  The Hanger  the labourers found  them frequently on that steep just under the soil in the chalk and of a considerable size In the lane above  Wellhead  in the way to  Emshot  they abound in the bank in a darkish sort of marl and are usually very small and soft but in  Clay's Pond  a little farther on at the end of the pit where the soil is dug out for manure I have occasionally observed them of large dimensions perhaps fourteen or sixteen inches in diameter But as these did not consist of firm stone but were formed of a kind of  terra lapidosa  or hardened clay as soon as they were exposed to the rains and frost they mouldered away These seemed as if they were a very recent production In the chalkpit at the northwest end of  The Hanger  large  nautili  are sometimes observed  In the very thickest strata of our freestone and at considerable depths welldiggers often find large  scallops  or  pectines  having both shells deeply striated and ridged and furrowed alternately They are highly impregnated with if not wholly composed of the stone of the quarry  LETTER IV TO THE SAME  AS in a former letter the  freestone  of this place has been only mentioned incidentally I shall here become more particular  This stone is in great request for hearthstones and the beds of ovens and in lining of limekilns it turns to good account for the workmen use sandy loam instead of mortar the sand of which fluxes  There may probably be also in the chalk itself that is burnt for lime a proportion of sand for few chalks are so pure as to have none  and runs by the intense heat and so cases over the  whole face of the kiln with a strong vitrified coat like glass that it is well preserved from injuries of weather and endures thirty or forty years When chiseled smooth it makes elegant fronts for houses equal in colour and grain to the  Bath  stone and superior in one respect that when seasoned it does not scale Decent chimneypieces are worked from it of much closer and finer grain than  Portland  and rooms are floored with it but it proves rather too soft for this purpose It is a freestone cutting in all directions yet has something of a grain parallel with the horizon and therefore should not be  surbedded  but laid in the same position that it grows in the quarry  To  surbed  stone is to set it edgewise contrary to the posture it had in the quarry says Dr  Plot Oxfordsh  p But  surbedding  does not succeed in our dry walls neither do we use it so in ovens though he says it is best for  Teynton  stone  On the ground abroad this firestone will not succeed for pavements because probably some degree of saltness prevailing within it the rain tears the slabs to pieces  "Firestone is full of salts and has no sulphur must be close grained and have no interstices Nothing supports fire like salts saltstone perishes exposed to wet and frost"  Plot's Staff  p  Though this stone is too hard to be acted on by vinegar yet both the white part and even the  blue rag  ferments strongly in mineral acids Though the white stone will not bear wet yet in every quarry at intervals there are thin strata of  blue rag  which resist rain and frost and are excellent for pitching of stables paths and courts and for building of dry walls against banks a valuable species of fencing much in use in this village and for mending of roads This  rag  is rugged and stubborn and will not hew to a smooth face but is very durable yet as these strata are shallow and lie deep large quantities cannot be procured but at considerable expense Among the  blue rags  turn up some blocks tinged  with a stain of  yellow  or  rust colour  which seem to be nearly as lasting as the blue and every now and then balls of a friable substance like rust of iron called  rust balls  In  Wolmer Forest  I see but one sort of stone called by the workmen  sand  or  foreststone  This is generally of the colour of rusty iron and might probably be worked as iron ore is very hard and heavy and of a firm compact texture and composed of a small roundish crystalline grit cemented together by a brown terrene ferruginous matter will not cut without difficulty nor easily strike fire with steel Being often found in broad flat pieces it makes good pavement for paths about houses never becoming slippery in frost or rain is excellent for dry walls and is sometimes used in buildings In many parts of that waste it lies scattered on the surface of the ground but is dug on  Weaver's Down  a vast hill on the eastern verge of that forest where the pits are shallow and the stratum thin This stone is imperishable  From a notion of rendering their work the more elegant and giving it a finish masons chip this stone into small fragments about the size of the head of a large nail and then stick the pieces into the wet mortar along the joints of their freestone walls this embellishment carries an odd appearance and has occasioned strangers sometimes to ask us pleasantly  "whether we fastened our walls together with tenpenny nails"  LETTER V TO THE SAME  AMONG the singularities of this place the two rocky hollow lanes the one to  Alton  and the other to the forest deserve our attention These roads running through the malm lands are by the traffick of ages and the fretting of water worn down through the first stratum of our freestone and partly through the second so that they look more like watercourses than roads and are bedded with naked  rag  for furlongs together In many places they are reduced sixteen or eighteen feet beneath the level of the fields and after floods and in frosts exhibit very grotesque and wild appearances from the tangled roots that are twisted among the strata and from the torrents rushing down their broken sides and especially when those cascades are frozen into icicles hanging in all the fanciful shapes of frostwork These rugged gloomy scences affright the ladies when they peep down into them from the paths above and make timid horsemen shudder while they ride along them but delight the naturalist with their various botany and particularly with their curious  filices  with which they abound  The manor of  Selborne  was it strictly looked after with all it's kindly aspects and all it's sloping coverts would swarm with game even now hares partridges and pheasants abound and in old days woodcocks were as plentiful There are few quails because they more affect open fields than enclosures after harvest some few landrails are seen  The parish of  Selborne  by taking in so much of the forest is a vast district Those who tread the bounds are employed part of  three days in the business and are of opinion that the outline in all it's curves and indentings does not comprise less than thirty miles  The village stands in a sheltered spot secured by  The Hanger  from the strong westerly winds The air is soft but rather moist from the effluvia of so many trees yet perfectly healthy and free from agues  The quantity of rain that falls on it is very considerable as may be supposed in so woody and mountainous a district As my experience in measuring the water is but of short date I am not qualified to give the mean quantity  A very intelligent gentleman assures me and he speaks from upwards of forty years experience that the mean rain of any place cannot be ascertained till a person has measured it for a very long period  "If I had only measured the rain"  says he  "for the four first years from to I should have said the mean rain at  Lyndon  was hf inch for the year if from to hf inches The mean rain before was qr from and since hf from to If only and had been measured  Lyndon  mean rain would have been called inches"  I only know that     Inch  Hund  From May to the end of the year there fell      From Jan to Jan      From Jan

many scattered houses along the verge of  the forest contain upwards of six hundred and seventy inhabitants  A  STATE  of the  Parish  of  SELBORNE  taken  OCTOBER  The number of tenements or families  The number of inhabitants in the street is  In the rest of the parish  Total near five inhabitants to each tenement  In the time of the Rev  Gilbert White  Vicar who died in the number of inhabitants

females  The burials of each sex were equal  And the births exceeded the deaths    We abound with poor many of whom are sober and industrious and live comfortably in good stone or brick cottages which are glazed and have chambers above stairs mud buildings we have none Besides the employment from husbandry the men work in hop gardens of which we have many and fell and bark timber In the spring and summer the women weed the corn and enjoy a second harvest in September by hop picking Formerly in the dead months they availed themselves greatly by spinning wool for making of  barragons  a genteel corded stuff much in vogue at that time for summer wear and chiefly manufactured at  Alton  a neighbouring town by some of the people called Quakers but from circumstances this trade is at an end  Since the passage above was written I am happy in being able to say that the spinning employment is a little revived to the no small comfort of the industrious housewife  The inhabitants enjoy a good share of health and longevity and the parish swarms with children  LETTER VI TO THE SAME  SHOULD I omit to describe with some exactness the  forest  of  Wolmer  of which three fifths perhaps lie in this parish my account of  Selborne  would be very imperfect as it is a district abounding with many curious productions both animal and vegetable and has often afforded me much entertainment both as a sportsman and as a naturalist  The royal  forest  of  Wolmer  is a tract of land of about seven miles in length by two and a half in breadth running nearly from North to South and is abutted on to begin to the South and so to proceed eastward by the parishes of  Greatham Lysse Rogate  and  Trotton  in the county of  Sussex  by  Bramshot Hedleigh  and  Kingsley  This royalty consists entirely of sand covered with heath and fern but is somewhat diversified with hills and dales without having one standing tree in the whole extent In the bottoms where the waters stagnate are many bogs which formerly abounded with subterraneous trees though Dr  Plot  says positively  See his Hist of  Staffordshire  that  "there never were any fallen trees hidden in the mosses of the southern counties"  But he was mistaken for I myself have seen cottages on the verge of this wild district whose timbers consisted of a black hard wood looking like oak which the owners assured me they procured from the bogs by probing the soil with spits or some such instruments but the peat is so much cut out and the moors have been so well examined that none has been found of late  Old people have assured me that on a winter's morning they have discovered these trees in the bogs by the hoar frost which lay longer over the space where they were concealed than on the surrounding morass Nor does this seem to be a fanciful notion but consistent with true philosophy Dr  Hales  saith  "That the warmth of the earth at some depth under ground has an influence in promoting a thaw as well as the change of the weather from a freezing to a thawing state is manifest from this observation viz Nov a little snow having fallen in the night it was by eleven the next morning mostly melted away on the surface of the earth except in several places in  Bushypark  where there were  drains  dug and covered with earth on which the snow continued to lie whether those drains were full of water or dry as also where  clmpipes  lay under ground a plain proof this that those drains intercepted the warmth of the earth from ascending from greater depths below them for the snow lay where the drain had more than four feet depth of earth over it It continued also to lie on thatch tiles and the tops of walls"  See  Hales  's Haemastatics p Quere Might not such observations be reduced to domestic use by promoting the discovery of old obliterated drains and wells about houses and in Roman stations and camps lead to the finding of pavements baths and graves and other hidden relics of curious antiquity  Besides the oak I have also been shewn pieces of fossilwood of a paler colour and softer nature which the inhabitants called  fir but upon a nice examination and trial by fire I could discover nothing resinous in them and therefore rather suppose that they were parts of a willow or alder or some such aquatic tree  This lonely domain is a very agreeable haunt for many sorts of wild fowls which not only frequent it in the winter but breed there in the summer such as lapwings snipes wildducks and as I have discovered within these few years teals Partridges in vast plenty are bred in good seasons on the verge of this forest into which they love to make excursions and in particular in the dry summer of and and some years after they swarmed to such a degree that parties of unreasonable sportsmen killed twenty and sometimes thirty brace in a day  But there was a nobler species of game in this forest now extinct which I have heard old people say abounded much before shooting flying became so common and that was the  heathcock black game  or  grouse  When I was a little boy I recollect one coming now and then to my father's table The last pack remembered was killed about thirtyfive years ago and within these ten years one solitary  grey hen  was sprung by some beagles in beating for a hare The sportsmen cried out  "A hen pheasant"  but a gentleman present who had often seen grouse in the north of England assured me that it was a greyhen  Nor does the loss of our black game prove the only gap in the  Fauna Selborniensis  for another beautiful link in the chain of beings  is wanting I mean the  red deer  which toward the beginning of this century amounted to about five hundred head and made a stately appearance There is an old keeper now alive named  Adams  whose great grandfather mentioned in a perambulation taken in grandfather father and self enjoyed the head keepership of  Wolmer forest  in succession for more than an hundred years This person assures me that his father has often told him that Queen  Anne  as she was journeying on the  Portsmouth  road did not think the forest of  Wolmer  beneath her royal regard For she came out of the great road at  Lippock  which is just by and reposing herself on a bank smoothed for that purpose lying about half a mile to the east of  Wolmerpond  and still called  Queen'sbank  saw with great complacency and satisfaction the whole herd of red deer brought by the keepers along the yale before her consisting then of about five hundred head A sight this worthy the attention of the greatest sovereign But he farther adds that by means of the  Waltham blacks  or to use his own expression as soon as they began  blacking  they were reduced to about fifty head and so continued decreasing till the time of the late Duke of  Cumberland  It is now more than thirty years ago that his highness sent down an huntsman and six yeomenprickers in scarlet jackets laced with gold attended by the staghounds ordering them to take every deer in this forest alive and to convey them in carts to  Windsor  In the course of the summer they caught every stag some of which shewed extraordinary diversion but in the following winter when the hinds were also carried off such fine chases were exhibited as served the country people for matter of talk and wonder for years afterwards I saw myself one of the yeomenprickers single out a stag from the herd and must confess that it was the most curious feat of activity I ever beheld superior to any thing in Mr  Astley  's  ridingschool The exertions made by the horse and deer much exceeded all my expectations though the former greatly excelled the latter in speed When the devoted deer was separated from his companions they gave him by their watches law as they called it for twenty minutes when sounding their horns the stopdogs were permitted to pursue and a most gallant scene ensued  LETTER VII TO THE SAME  THOUGH large herds of deer do much harm to the neighbourhood yet the injury to the morals of the people is of more moment than the loss of their crops The temptation is irresistible for most men are sportsmen by constitution and there is such an inherent spirit for hunting in human nature as scarce any inhibitions can restrain Hence towards the beginning of this century all this country was wild about deerstealing Unless he was a  hunter  as they affected to call themselves no young person was allowed to be possessed of manhood or gallantry The  Waltham blacks  at length committed such enormities that government was forced to interfere with that severe and sanguinary act called the  black act  Statute  Geo  I c  which now comprehends more felonies than any law that ever was framed before And therefore a late bishop of  Winchester  when urged to restock  Walthamchase  This chase remains unstocked to this day the bishop was Dr  Hoadly  refused from a motive worthy of a prelate replying that  "it had done mischief enough already"  Our old race of deerstealers are hardly extinct yet it was but a little while ago that over their ale they used to recount the exploits of their youth such as watching the pregnant hind to her lair and when the calf was dropped paring it's feet with a penknife to the quick to prevent it's escape till it was large and fat enough to be killed the shooting at one of their neighbours with a bullet in a turnipfield by moonshine mistaking him for a deer and the losing a dog in the following extraordinary mannerSome fellows suspecting that a calf newfallen was deposited in a certain spot of thick fern went with a lurcher to surprise it when the parenthind rushed out of the brake and taking a vast spring with all her feet close together pitched upon the neck of the dog and broke it short in two  Another temptation to idleness and sporting was a number of rabbits which possessed all the hillocks and dry places but these being inconvenient to the huntsmen on account of their burrows when they came to take away the deer they permitted the country people to destroy them all  Such forests and wastes when their allurements to irregularities are removed are of considerable service to neighbourhoods that verge upon them by furnishing them with peat and turf for their firing with fuel for the burning their lime and with ashes for their grasses and by maintaining their geese and their stock of young cattle at little or no expense  The manorfarm of the parish of  Greatham  has an admitted  claim I see by an old record taken from the  Tower of London  of turning all live stock on the forest at proper seasons  bidentibus exceptis  For this privilege the owner of that estate used to pay to the king annually seven bushels of oats  The reason I presume why sheep  In  The Holt  where a full stock of fallowdeer has been kept up till lately no sheep are admitted to this day  are excluded is because being such close grazers they would pick out all the finest grasses and hinder the deer from thriving  Though by statute and  W  and  Mary  c  "to burn on any waste between  Candlemas  and  Midsummer  any grig ling heath and furze goss or fern is punishable with whipping and confinement in the house of correction"  yet in this forest about  March  or  April  according to the dryness of the season such vast heathfires are lighted up that they often get to a masterless head and catching the hedges have sometimes been communicated to the underwoods woods and coppices where great damage has ensued The plea for these burnings is that when the old coat of heath c is consumed young will sprout up and afford much tender brouze for cattle but where there is large old furze the fire following the roots consumes the very ground so that for hundreds of acres nothing is to be seen but smother and desolation the whole circuit round looking like the cinders of a volcano and the soil being quite exhausted no traces of vegetation are to be found for years These conflagrations as they take place usually with a northeast or east wind much annoy this village with their smoke and often alarm the country and once in particular I remember that a gentleman who lives beyond  Andover  coming to my house when he got on the downs between that town and  Winchester  at twentyfive miles  distance was surprised much with smoke and a hot smell of fire and concluded that  Alresford  was in flames but when he came to that town he then had apprehensions for the next village and so on to the end of his journey  On two of the most conspicuous eminences of this forest stand two  arbours  or  bowers  made of the boughs of oaks the one called  Waldonlodge  the other  Brimstonelodge  these the keepers renew annually on the feast of St  Barnabas  taking the old materials for a perquisite The farm called  Blackmoor  in this parish is obliged to find the posts and brushwood for the former while the farms at  Greatham  in rotation furnish for the latter and are all enjoined to cut and deliver the materials at the spot This custom I mention because I look upon it to be of very remote antiquity  LETTER VIII TO THE SAME  ON the verge of the forest as it is now circumscribed are three considerable lakes two in  Oakhanger  of which I have nothing particular to say and one called  Bin's  or  Bean's pond  which is worthy the attention of a naturalist or a sportsman For being crowded at the upper end with willows and with the  carex cespitosa  I mean that sort which rising into tall hassocks is called by the foresters  torrets  a corruption I suppose of turrets  Note  In the beginning of the summer the royal forests of  Wolmer  and  Holt  were measured by persons sent down by government  it affords such a safe and pleasing shelter to wild ducks  teals snipes c that they breed there In the winter this covert is also frequented by foxes and sometimes by pheasants and the bogs produce many curious plants For which consult letter XLII to Mr  Barrington    By a  perambulation  of  Wolmer forest  and  The Holt  made in and in the eleventh year of  Charles  the First which now lies before me it appears that the limits of the former are much circumscribed For to say nothing of the farther side with which I am not so well acquainted the bounds on this side in old times came into  Binswood  and extended to the ditch of  Ward le hampark  in which stands the curious mount called  King John's Hill  and  Lodge Hill  and to the verge of  Hartley Mauduit  called  Mauduithatch  comprehending also  Shortheath Oakhanger  and  Oakwoods  a large district now private property though once belonging to the royal domain  It is remarkable that the term  purlieu  is never once mentioned in this long roll of parchment It contains besides the  perambulation  a rough estimate of the value of the timbers which were considerable growing at that time in the district of  The Holt  and enumerates the officers superior and inferior of those joint forests for the time being and their ostensible fees and perquisites In those days as at present there were hardly any trees in  Wolmer forest  Within the present limits of the forest are three considerable lakes  Hogmer Cranmer  and  Wolmer  all of which are stocked with carp tench eels and perch but the fish do not thrive well because the water is hungry and the bottoms are a naked sand  A circumstance respecting these ponds though by no means peculiar to them I cannot pass over in silence and that is that instinct by which in summer all the kine whether oxen cows  calves or heifers retire constantly to the water during the hotter hours where being more exempt from flies and inhaling the coolness of that element some belly deep and some only to midleg they ruminate and solace themselves from about ten in the morning till four in the afternoon and then return to their feeding During this great proportion of the day they drop much dung in which insects nestle and so supply food for the fish which would be poorly subsisted but from this contingency Thus Nature who is a great economist converts the recreation of one animal to the support of another  Thomson  who was a nice observer of natural occurrences did not let this pleasing circumstance escape him He says in his  Summer  "A various group the herds and flocks compose  " on the grassy bank  "Some ruminating lie while others stand  "Half in the flood and often bending sip  "The circling surface"  Wolmerpond  so called I suppose for eminence sake is a vast lake for this part of the world containing in it's whole circumference yards or very near a mile and an half The length of the northwest and opposite side is about yards and the breadth of the southwest end about yards This measurement which I caused to be made with good exactness gives an area of about sixtysix acres exclusive of a large irregular arm at the northeast corner which we did not take into the reckoning  On the face of this expanse of waters and perfectly secure from fowlers lie all day long in the winter season vast flocks of ducks teals and wigeons of various denominations where they preen and solace and rest themselves till towards sunset when they issue forth in little parties for in their natural state they are all  birds of the night to feed in the brooks and meadows returning again with the dawn of the morning Had this lake an arm or two more and were it planted round with thick covert for now it is perfectly naked it might make a valuable decoy  Yet neither it's extent nor the clearness of it's water nor the resort of various and curious fowls nor it's picturesque groups of cattle can render this  meer  so remarkable as the great quantity of coins that were found in it's bed about forty years ago But as such discoveries more properly belong to the  antiquities  of this place I shall suppress all particulars for the present till I enter professedly on my series of letters respecting the more remote history of this village and district  LETTER IX TO THE SAME  BY way of supplement I shall trouble you once more on this subject to inform you that  Wolmer  with her sister forest  Ayles Holt  alias  Alice Holt  "In Rot Inquisit de statu forest in Scaccar Ed it is called  Aisholt  "  In the same  "Tit  Woolmer  and  Aisholt  Hantisc Dominus Rex habet unam capellam in  haia  suâ de Kingesle"  "  Haia sepes sepimentum parcus  a Gall  haie  and  haye  "  Spelman's Glossary  as it is called in old records is held by grant from the crown for a term of years  The grantees that the author remembers are BrigadierGeneral  Emanuel Scroope Howe  and his lady  Ruperta  who was a natural daughter of Prince  Rupert  by  Margaret Hughs  a Mr  Mordaunt  of  the  Peterborough  family who married a dowager Lady  Pembroke Henry Bilson Legge  and lady and now Lord  Stawel  their son  The lady of General  Howe  lived to an advanced age long surviving her husband and at her death left behind her many curious pieces of mechanism of her father's constructing who was a distinguished mechanic and artist  This prince was the inventor of  mezzotinto  as well as warrior and among the rest a very complicated clock lately in possession of Mr  Elmer  the celebrated gamepainter at  Farnham  in the county of  Surrey  Though these two forests are only parted by a narrow range of enclosures yet no two soils can be more different for  The Holt  consists of a strong loam of a miry nature carrying a good turf and abounding with oaks that grow to be large timber while  Wolmer  is nothing but a hungry sandy barren waste  The former being all in the parish of  Binsted  is about two miles in extent from north to south and near as much from east to west and contains within it many woodlands and lawns and the  great lodge  where the grantees reside and a smaller lodge called  Goosegreen  and is abutted on by the parishes of  Kingsley Frinsham Farnham  and  Bentley  all of which have right of common  One thing is remarkable that though  The Holt  has been of old well stocked with fallowdeer unrestrained by any pales or fences more than a common hedge yet they were never seen within the limits of  Wolmer  nor were the red deer of  Wolmer  ever known to haunt the thickets or glades of  The Holt  At present the deer of  The Holt  are much thinned and reduced by the nighthunters who perpetually harass them in spite of the  efforts of numerous keepers and the severe penalties that have been put in force against them as often as they have been detected and rendered liable to the lash of the law Neither fines nor imprisonments can deter them so impossible is it to extinguish the spirit of sporting which seems to be inherent in human nature  General  Howe  turned out some  German  wild boars and sows in his forests to the great terror of the neighbourhood and at one time a wild bull or buffalo but the country rose upon them and destroyed them  A very large fall of timber consisting of about one thousand oaks has been cut this spring viz in  The Holt forest  one fifth of which it is said belongs to the grantee Lord  Stawel  He lays claim also to the lop and top but the poor of the parishes of  Binsted  and  Frinsham Bentley  and  Kingsley  assert that it belongs to them and assembling in a riotous manner have actually taken it all away One man who keeps a team has carried home for his share forty stacks of wood Fortyfive of these people his Lordship has served with actions These trees which were very sound and in high perfection were  wintercut  viz in  February  and  March  before the bark would run In old times  The Holt  was estimated to be eighteen miles computed measure from watercarriage  viz  from the town of  Chertsey  on the  Thames  but now it is not half that distance since the  Wey  is made navigable up to the town of  Godalming  in the county of  Surrey  LETTER X TO THE SAME  August  IT has been my misfortune never to have had any neighbours whose studies have led them towards the pursuit of natural knowledge so that for want of a companion to quicken my industry and sharpen my attention I have made but slender progress in a kind of information to which I have been attached from my childhood  As to  swallows hirundines rusticae  being found in a torpid state during the winter in the isle of  Wight  or any part of this country I never heard any such account worth attending to But a clergyman of an inquisitive turn assures me that when he was a great boy some workmen in pulling down the battlements of a church tower early in the spring found two or three  swifts hirundines apodes  among the rubbish which were at first appearance dead but on being carried toward the fire revived He told me that out of his great care to preserve them he put them in a paperbag and hung them by the kitchen fire where they were suffocated  Another intelligent person has informed me that while he was a schoolboy at  Brighthelmstone  in  Sussex  a great fragment of the chalkcliff fell down one stormy winter on the beach and that many people found  swallows  among the rubbish but on my questioning him whether he saw any of those birds himself to my no small disappointment he answered me in the negative but that others assured him they did  Young broods of  swallows  began to appear this year on  July  the eleventh and young  martins hirundines urbicae  were then fledged in their nests Both species will breed again once For I see by my  fauna  of last year that young broods came forth so late as  September  the eighteenth Are not these late hatchings more in favour of hiding than migration Nay some young martins remained in their nests last year so late as  September  the twentyninth and yet they totally disappeared with us by the fifth of  October  How strange is it that the  swift  which seems to live exactly the same life with the  swallow  and  housemartin  should leave us before the middle of  August  invariably while the latter stay often till the middle of  October  and once I saw numbers of housemartins on the seventh of  November  The martins and  redwing fieldfares  were flying in sight together an uncommon assemblage of summer and winterbirds  A little yellow bird it is either a species of the  alauda trivialis  or rather perhaps of the  motacilla trochilus  still continues to make a sibilous shivering noise in the tops of tall woods The  stoparola  of  Ray  for which we have as yet no name in these parts is called in your  Zoology  the  flycatcher  There is one circumstance characteristic of this bird which seems to have escaped observation and that is it takes it's stand on the top of some stake or post from whence it springs forth on it's prey catching a fly in the air and hardly ever touching the ground but returning still to the same stand for many times together  I perceive there are more than one species of the  motacilla trochilus  Mr  Derham  supposes in  Ray's Philos Letters  that he has discovered three In these there is again an instance of some very common birds that have as yet no  English  name  Mr  Stillingfleet  makes a question whether the  blackcap motacilla atricapilla  be a bird of passage or not I think there is no doubt of it for in  April  in the first fine weather they come trooping all at once into these parts but are never seen in the winter They are delicate songsters  Numbers of  snipes  breed every summer in some moory ground on the verge of this parish It is very amusing to see the cock bird on wing at that time and to hear his piping and humming notes  I have had no opportunity yet of procuring any of those mice which I mentioned to you in town The person that brought me the last says they are plenty in harvest at which time I will take care to get more and will endeavour to put the matter out of doubt whether it be a nondescript species or not  I suspect much there may be two species of waterrats  Ray  says and  Linnaeus  after him that the waterrat is webfooted behind Now I have discovered a rat on the banks of our little stream that is not webfooted and yet is an exellent swimmer and diver it answers exactly to the  mus amphibius  of  Linnaeus  See  Syst Nat  which he says  "  natat in fossis urinatur  "  I should be glad to procure one  "  plantis palmatis  "  Linnaeus  seems to be in a puzzle about his  mus amphibius  and to doubt whether it differs from his  mus terrestris  which if it be as he allows the  "  mus agrestis capite grandi brachyuros  "  of  Ray  is widely different from the waterrat both in size make and manner of life  As to the  falco  which I mentioned in town I shall take the liberty to send it down to you into  Wales  presuming on your candour that you will excuse me if it should appear as familiar to you as it is strange to me Though mutilated  "  qualem dices antehac fuisse tales cum sint reliquiae  "  It haunted a marshy piece of ground in quest of wildducks and snipes but when it was shot had just knocked down a rook which it was tearing in pieces I cannot make it answer to any of our  English  hawks neither could I find any like it at the curious exhibition of stuffed birds in  SpringGardens  I found it nailed up at the end of a barn which is the countryman's museum  The parish I live in is a very abrupt uneven country full of hills and woods and therefore full of birds  LETTER XI TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  September  IT will not be without impatience that I shall wait for your thoughts with regard to the  falco  as to it's weight breadth c I wish I had set them down at the time but to the best of my remembrance it weighed two pounds and eight ounces and measured from wing to wing thirtyeight inches It's  cere  and feet were yellow and the circle of it's eyelids a bright yellow As it had been killed some days and the eyes were sunk I could make no good observation on the colour of the pupils and the  irides  The most unusual birds I ever observed in these parts were a pair of  hoopoes upupa  which came several years ago in the summer and frequented an ornamented piece of ground which joins to my garden for some weeks They used to march about in a stately manner feeding in the walks many times in the day and seemed  disposed to breed in my outlet but were frighted and persecuted by idle boys who would never let them be at rest  Three  grossbeaks loxia coccothraustes  appeared some years ago in my fields in the winter one of which I shot since that now and then one is occasionally seen in the same dead season  A  crossbill loxia curvirostra  was killed last year in this neighbourhood  Our streams which are small and rise only at the end of the village yield nothing but the  bull'shead  or  miller'sthumb gobius fluviatilis capitatus  the  trout trutta fluviatilis  the  eel anguilla the lampern lampaetra parva et fluviatilis  and the  stickleback pisciculus aculeatus  We are twenty miles from the sea and almost as many from a great river and therefore see but little of seabirds As to wild fowls we have a few teems of  ducks  bred in the moors where the snipes breed and multitudes of  widgeons  and  teals  in hard weather frequent our lakes in the forest  Having some acquaintance with a tame  brown owl  I find that it casts up the fur of mice and the feathers of birds in pellets after the manner of hawks when full like a dog it hides what it cannot eat  The young of the barnowl are not easily raised as they want a constant supply of fresh mice whereas the young of the brown owl will eat indiscriminately all that is brought snails rats kittens puppies magpies and any kind of carrion or offal  The housemartins have eggs still and squabyoung The last swift I observed was about the twentyfirst of  August  it was a straggler  Redstarts flycatchers whitethroats  and  reguli non cristati  still appear but I have seen no  blackcaps  lately  I forgot to mention that I once saw in  Christ Church  college quadrangle in  Oxford  on a very sunny warm morning a  house martin  flying about and settling on the parapets so late as the twentieth of  November  At present I know only two species of  bats  the common  vespertilio murinus  and the  vespertilio auribus  I was much entertained last summer with a tame bat which would take flies out of a person's hand If you gave it any thing to eat it brought it's wings round before the mouth hovering and hiding it's head in the manner of birds of prey when they feed The adroitness it shewed in shearing off the wings of the flies which were always rejected was worthy of observation and pleased me much Insects seemed to be most acceptable though it did not refuse raw flesh when offered so that the notion that bats go down chimnies and gnaw men's bacon seems no improbable story While I amused myself with this wonderful quadruped I saw it several times confute the vulgar opinion that bats when down on a flat furface cannot get on the wing again by rising with great ease from the floor It ran I observed with more dispatch than I was aware of but in a most ridiculous and grotesque manner  Bats drink on the wing like swallows by sipping the surface as they play over pools and streams They love to frequent waters not only for the sake of drinking but on account of insects which are found over them in the greatest plenty As I was going some years ago pretty late in a boat from  Richmond  to  Sunbury  on a warm summer's evening I think I saw myriads of bats between the two places the air swarmed with them all along the  Thames  so that hundreds were in sight at a time  I am c  LETTER XII TO THE SAME  November  SIR  IT gave me no small satisfaction to hear that the  falco  This hawk proved to be the  falco peregrinus  a variety  turned out an uncommon one I must confess I should have been better pleased to have heard that I had sent you a bird that you had never seen before but that I find would be a difficult task  I have procured some of the mice mentioned in my former letters a young one and a female with young both of which I have preserved in brandy From the colour shape size and manner of nesting I make no doubt but that the species is nondescript They are much smaller and more slender than the  mus domesticus medius  of  Ray  and have more of the squirrel or dormouse colour their belly is white a straight line along their sides divides the shades of their back and belly They never enter into houses are carried into ricks and barns with the sheaves abound in harvest and build their nests amidst the straws of the corn above the ground and sometimes in thistles They breed as many as eight at a litter in a little round nest composed of the blades of grass or wheat  One of these nests I procured this autumn most artificially platted and composed of the blades of wheat perfectly round and about the size of a cricketball with the aperture so ingeniously closed that there was no discovering to what part it  belonged It was so compact and well filled that it would roll across the table without being discomposed though it contained eight little mice that were naked and blind As this nest was perfectly full how could the dam come at her litter respectively so as to administer a teat to each perhaps she opens different places for that purpose adjusting them again when the business is over but she could not possibly be contained herself in the ball with her young which moreover would be daily increasing in bulk This wonderful procreant cradle an elegant instance of the efforts of instinct was found in a wheatfield suspended in the head of a thistle  A gentleman curious in birds wrote me word that his servant had shot one last  January  in that severe weather which he believed would puzzle me I called to see it this summer not knowing what to expect but the moment I took it in hand I pronounced it the male  garrulus bohemicus  or  German  silktail from the five peculiar crimson tags or points which it carries at the ends of five of the short remiges It cannot I suppose with any propriety be called an  English  bird and yet I see by  Ray's Philosoph Letters  that great flocks of them feeding on haws appeared in this kingdom in the winter of  The mention of haws puts me in mind that there is a total failure of that wild fruit so conducive to the support of many of the winged nation For the same severe weather late in the spring which cut off all the produce of the more tender and curious trees destroyed also that of the more hardy and common  Some birds haunting with the misselthrushes and feeding on the berries of the yewtree which answered to the description of the  merula torquata  or  ringouzel  were lately seen in this neighbourhood  I employed some people to procure me a specimen but without success See Letter VIII  Query  Might not  Canary  birds be naturalized to this climate provided their eggs were put in the spring into the nests of some of their congeners as goldfinches greenfinches c Before winter perhaps they might be hardened and able to shift for themselves  About ten years ago I used to spend some weeks yearly at  Sunbury  which is one of those pleasant villages lying on the  Thames  near  Hamptoncourt  In the autumn I could not help being much amused with those myriads of the swallow kind which assemble in those parts But what struck me most was that from the time they began to congregate forsaking the chimnies and houses they roosted every night in the osierbeds of the aits of that river Now this resorting towards that element at that season of the year seems to give some countenance to the northern opinion strange as it is of their retiring under water A  Swedish  naturalist is so much persuaded of that fact that he talks in his calendar of  Flora  as familiarly of the swallow's going under water in the beginning of  September  as he would of his poultry going to roost a little before sunset  An observing gentleman in  London  writes me word that he saw an housemartin on the twentythird of last  October  flying in and out of it's nest in the  Borough  And I myself on the twentyninth of last  October  as I was travelling through  Oxford  saw four or five swallows hovering round and settling on the roof of the countyhospital  Now is it likely that these poor little birds which perhaps had not been hatched but a few weeks should at that late season of the  year and from so midland a county attempt a voyage to  Goree  or  Senegal  almost as far as the  equator  See  Adanson  's Voyage to  Senegal    I acquiesce entirely in your opinionthat though most of the swallow kind may migrate yet that some do stay behind and hide with us during the winter  As to the shortwinged softbilled birds which come trooping in such numbers in the spring I am at a loss even what to suspect about them I watched them narrowly this year and saw them abound till about  Michaelmas  when they appeared no longer Subsist they cannot openly among us and yet elude the eyes of the inquisitive and as to their hiding no man pretends to have found any of them in a torpid state in the winter But with regard to their migration what difficulties attend that supposition that such feeble bad fliers who the summer long never flit but from hedge to hedge should be able to traverse vast seas and continents in order to enjoy milder seasons amidst the regions of  Africa  LETTER XIII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Jan  SIR  As in one of your former letters you expressed the more satisfaction from my correspondence on account of my living in the most southerly county so now I may return the compliment and expect to have my curiosity gratified by your living much more to the North  For many years past I have observed that towards  Christmas  vast flocks of chaffinches have appeared in the fields many more I used to think than could be hatched in any one neighbourhood But when I came to observe them more narrowly I was amazed to find that they seemed to me to be almost all hens I communicated my suspicions to some intelligent neighbours who after taking pains about the matter declared that they also thought them all mostly females at least fifty to one This extraordinary occurrence brought to my mind the remark of  Linnaeus  that  "before winter all their hen chaffinches migrate through  Holland  into  Italy  "  Now I want to know from some curious person in the north whether there are any large flocks of these finches with them in the winter and of which sex they mostly consist For from such intelligence one might be able to judge whether our female flocks migrate from the other end of the island or whether they come over to us from the continent  We have in the winter vast flocks of the common linnets more I think than can be bred in any one district These I observe when the spring advances assemble on some tree in the sunshine and join all in a gentle sort of chirping as if they were about to break up their winter quarters and betake themselves to their proper summer homes It is well known at least that the swallows and the fieldfares do congregate with a gentle twittering before they make their respective departure  You may depend on it that the bunting  emberiza miliaria  does not leave this county in the winter In  January  I saw several dozen of them in the midst of a severe frost among the bushes on the downs near  Andover  in our woodland enclosed district it is a rare bird  Wagtails both white and yellow are with us all the winter Quails crowd to our southern coast and are often killed in numbers by people that go on purpose  Mr  Stillingfleet  in his Tracts says that  "if the wheatear  aenanthe  does not quit  England  it certainly shifts places for about harvest they are not to be found where there was before great plenty of them"  This well accounts for the vast quantities that are caught about that time on the south downs near  Lewes  where they are esteemed a delicacy There have been shepherds I have been credibly informed that have made many pounds in a season by catching them in traps And though such multitudes are taken I never saw and I am well acquainted with those parts above two or three at a time for they are never gregarious They may perhaps migrate in general and for that purpose draw towards the coast of  Sussex  in autumn but that they do not all withdraw I am sure because I see a few stragglers in many counties at all times of the year especially about warrens and stone quarries  I have no acquaintance at present among the gentlemen of the navy but have written to a friend who was a seachaplain in the late war desiring him to look into his minutes with respect to birds that settled on their rigging during their voyage up or down the channel What  Hasselquist  says on that subject is remarkable there were little shortwinged birds frequently coming on board his ship all the way from our channel quite up to the  Levant  especially before squally weather  What you suggest with regard to  Spain  is highly probable The winters of  Andalusia  are so mild that in all likelihood the softbilled birds that leave us at that season may find insects sufficient to support them there  Some young man possessed of fortune health and leisure should make an autumnal voyage into that kingdom and should spend a year there investigating the natural history of that vast country Mr  Willughby  See  Ray  's Travels p  passed through that kingdom on such an errand but he seems to have skirted along in a superficial manner and an ill humour being much disgusted at the rude dissolute manners of the people  I have no friend left now at  Sunbury  to apply to about the swallows roosting on the aits of the  Thames  nor can I hear any more about those birds which I suspected were  merulae torquatae  As to the small mice I have farther to remark that though they hang their nests for breeding up amidst the straws of the standing corn above the ground yet I find that in the winter they burrow deep in the earth and make warm beds of grass but their grand rendezvous seems to be in cornricks into which they are carried at harvest A neighbour housed an oatrick lately under the thatch of which were assembled near an hundred most of which were taken and some I saw I measured them and found that from nose to tail they were just two inches and a quarter and their tails just two inches long Two of them in a scale weighed down just one copper halfpenny which is about the third of an ounce avoirdupois so that I suppose they are the smallest quadrupeds in this island A fullgrown  mus medius domesticus  weighs I find one ounce lumping weight which is more than six times as much as the mouse above and measures from nose to rump four inches and a quarter and the same in it's tail We have had a very severe frost and deep snow this month My thermometer was one day fourteen degrees and  an half below the freezing point within doors The tender evergreens were injured pretty much It was very providential that the air was still and the ground well covered with snow else vegetation in general must have suffered prodigiously There is reason to believe that some days were more severe than any since the year  I am c c  LETTER XIV TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  March  DEAR SIR  IF some curious gentleman would procure the head of a fallowdeer and have it dissected he would find it furnished with two spiracula or breathingplaces besides the nostrils probably analogous to the  puncta lachrymalia  in the human head When deer are thirsty they plunge their noses like some horses very deep under water while in the act of drinking and continue them in that situation for a considerable time but to obviate any inconveniency they can open two vents one at the inner corner of each eye having a communication with the nose Here seems to be an extraordinary provision of nature worthy our attention and which has not that I know of been noticed by any naturalist For it looks as if these creatures would not be suffocated though both their mouths and nostrils were stopped This curious formation of the head may be of singular service to beasts of chase by  affording them free respiration and no doubt these additional nostrils are thrown open when they are hard run  In answer to this account Mr  Pennant  sent me the following curious and pertinent reply  "I was much surprised to find in the  ant elope  something analogous to what you mention as so remarkable in deer This animal also has a long slit beneath each eye which can be opened and shut at pleasure On holding an orange to one the creature made as much use of those orifices as of his nostrils applying them to the fruit and seeming to smell it through them"  Mr  Ray  observed that at  Malta  the owners slit up the nostrils of such asses as were hard worked for they being naturally strait or small did not admit air sufficient to serve them when they travelled or laboured in that hot climate And we know that grooms and gentlemen of the turf think large nostrils necessary and a perfection in hunters and running horses  Oppian  the  Greek  poet by the following line seems to have had some notion that stags have four spiracula  "Quadrifidae nares quadruplices ad respirationem canales"  Opp Cyn Lib ii l  Writers copying from one another make  Aristotle  say that goats breathe at their ears whereas he asserts just the contrary  "  "  "  Alcmaeon  does not advance what is true when he avers that goats breathe through their ears"  History of Animals Book I chap xi  LETTER XV TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  March  DEAR SIR  SOME intelligent country people have a notion that we have in these parts a species of the  genus mustelinum  besides the weasel stoat ferret and polecat a little reddish beast not much bigger than a field mouse but much longer which they call a  cane  This piece of intelligence can be little depended on but farther inquiry may be made  A gentleman in this neighbourhood had two milkwhite rooks in one nest A booby of a carter finding them before they were able to fly threw them down and destroyed them to the regret of the owner who would have been glad to have preserved such a curiofity in his rookery I saw the birds myself nailed against the end of a barn and was surprised to find that their bills legs feet and claws were milkwhite  A shepherd saw as he thought some white larks on a down above my house this winter were not these the  emberiza nivalis  the snowflake of the  Brit Zool  No doubt they were  A few years ago I saw a cock bullfinch in a cage which had been caught in the fields after it was come to it's full colours In about a year it began to look dingy and blackening every succeeding year it became coalblack at the end of four It's chief food was hempseed Such influence has food on the colour of animals The pied and mottled colours of domesticated animals are supposed to be owing to high various and unusual food  I had remarked for years that the root of the cuckoopint  arum  was frequently scratched out of the dry banks of hedges and eaten in severe snowy weather After observing with some exactness myself and getting others to do the same we found it was the thrush kind that searched it out The root of the  arum  is remarkably warm and pungent  Our flocks of female chaffinches have not yet forsaken us The blackbirds and thrushes are very much thinned down by that fierce weather in  January  In the middle of  February  I discovered in my tall hedges a little bird that raised my curiosity it was of that yellowgreen colour that belongs to the  salicaria  kind and I think was softbilled It was no  parus  and was too long and too big for the goldencrowned wren appearing most like the largest willowwren It hung sometimes with it's back downwards but never continuing one moment in the same place I shot at it but it was so desultory that I missed my aim  I wonder that the stone curlew  charadrius oedicnemus  should be mentioned by the writers as a rare bird it abounds in all the campaign parts of  Hampshire  and  Sussex  and breeds I think all the summer having young ones I know very late in the autumn Already they begin clamouring in the evening They cannot I think with any propriety be called as they are by Mr  Ray  "  circa aquas versantes  "  for with us by day at least they haunt only the most dry open upland fields and sheep walks far removed from water what they may do in the night I cannot say Worms are their usual food but they also eat toads and frogs  I can shew you some good specimens of my  new mice Linnaeus  perhaps would call the species  mus minimus  LETTER XVI TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  April  DEAR SIR  THE history of the stone curlew  charadrius oedicnemus  is as follows It lays it's eggs usually two never more than three on the bare ground without any nest in the field so that the countryman in stirring his fallows often destroys them The young run immediately from the egg like partridges c and are withdrawn to some flinty field by the dam where they sculk among the stones which are their best security for their feathers are so exactly of the colour of our grey spotted flints that the most exact observer unless he catches the eye of the young bird may be eluded The eggs are short and round of a dirty white spotted with dark bloody blotches Though I might not be able just when I pleased to procure you a bird yet I could shew you them almost any day and any evening you may hear them round the village for they make a clamour which may be heard a mile  Oedicnemus  is a most apt and expressive name for them since their legs seem swoln like those of a gouty man After harvest I have shot them before the pointers in turnipfields  I make no doubt but there are three species of the  willowwrens  two I know perfectly but have not been able yet to procure the third No two birds can differ more in their notes and that constantly than those two that I am acquainted with for the one has a joyous easy laughing note the other a harsh loud chirp  The former is every way larger and three quarters of an inch longer and weighs two drams and an half while the latter weighs but two so the songster is one fifth heavier than the chirper The chirper being the first summerbird of passage that is heard the wryneck sometimes excepted begins his two notes in the middle of  March  and continues them through the spring and summer till the end of  August  as appears by my journals The legs of the larger of these two are fleshcoloured of the less black  The  grasshopperlark  began his sibilous note in my fields last  Saturday  Nothing can be more amusing than the whisper of this little bird which seems to be close by though at an hundred yards distance and when close at your ear is scarce any louder than when a great way off Had I not been a little acquainted with insects and known that the grasshopper kind is not yet hatched I should have hardly believed but that it had been a  locusta  whispering in the bushes The country people laugh when you tell them that it is the note of a bird It is a most artful creature sculking in the thickest part of a bush and will sing at a yard distance provided it be concealed I was obliged to get a person to go on the other side of the hedge where it haunted and then it would run creeping like a mouse before us for an hundred yards together through the bottom of the thorns yet it would not come into fair sight but in a morning early and when undisturbed it sings on the top of a twig gaping and shivering with it's wings Mr  Ray  himself had no knowledge of this bird but received his account from Mr  Johnson  who apparently confounds it with the  reguli non cristati  from which it is very distinct See  Ray's Philos Letters  p  The flycatcher  stoparola  has not yet appeared it usually breeds in my vine The  redstart  begins to sing it's note is short and imperfect but is continued till about the middle of  June  The  willowwrens  the smaller sort are horrid pests in a garden destroying the pease cherries currants c and are so tame that a gun will not scare them  A  LIST  of the  SUMMER BIRDS  of  PASSAGE  discovered in this neighbourhood ranged somewhat in the Order in which they appear     Linnaei Nomina

proved to be the  sitta europaea    the nuthatch  Mr  Ray  says that the less spotted  woodpecker  does the same This noise may be heard a furlong or more  Now is the only time to ascertain the shortwinged summer birds for when the leaf is out there is no making any remarks on such a restless tribe and when once the young begin to appear it is all confusion there is no distinction of genus species or sex  In breedingtime snipes play over the moors piping and humming they always hum as they are descending Is not their hum ventriloquous like that of the turkey Some suspect it is made by their wings  This morning I saw the goldencrowned wren whose crown glitters like burnished gold It often hangs like a titmouse with it's back downwards  Yours c c  LETTER XVII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  June  DEAR SIR  ON  Wednesday  last arrived your agreeable letter of  June  the th It gives me great satisfaction to find that you pursue these studies still with such vigour and are in such forwardness with regard to reptiles and fishes  The reptiles few as they are I am not acquainted with so well as I could wish with regard to their natural history There is a degree of dubiousness and obscurity attending the propagation of this class of animals something analagous to that of the  cryptogamia  in the sexual system of plants and the case is the same with regard to some of the fishes as the eel c  The method in which toads procreate and bring forth seems to be very much in the dark Some authors say that they are viviparous and yet  Ray  classes them among his oviparous animals and is silent with regard to the manner of their bringing forth Perhaps they may be  as is known to be the case with the viper  The copulation of frogs or at least the appearance of it for  Swammerdam  proves that the male has no  penis intrans  is notorious to every body because we see them sticking upon each others backs for a month together in the spring and yet I never saw or read of toads being observed in the same situation It is strange that the matter with regard to the venom of toads has not been yet settled That they are not noxious to some animals is plain for ducks buzzards owls stone curlews and snakes eat them to my knowledge with impunity And I well remember the time but was not eyewitness to the fact though numbers of persons were when a quack at this village ate a toad to make the countrypeople stare afterwards he drank oil  I have been informed also from undoubted authority that some ladies ladies you will say of peculiar taste took a fancy to a toad which they nourished summer after summer for many years till he grew to a monstrous size with the maggots which turn to flesh flies The reptile used to come forth every evening from an hole under the gardensteps and was taken up after supper on the  table to be fed But at last a tame raven kenning him as he put forth his head gave him such a severe stroke with his horny beak as put out one eye After this accident the creature languished for some time and died  I need not remind a gentleman of your extensive reading of the excellent account there is from Mr  Derham  in  Ray  's Wisdom of God in the Creation p concerning the migration of frogs from their breeding ponds In this account he at once subverts that foolish opinion of their dropping from the clouds in rain shewing that it is from the grateful coolness and moisture of those showers that they are tempted to set out on their travels which they defer till those fall Frogs are as yet in their tadpole state but in a few weeks our lanes paths fields will swarm for a few days with myriads of those emigrants no larger than my little finger nail  Swammerdam  gives a most accurate account of the method and situation in which the male impregnates the spawn of the female How wonderful is the oeconomy of Providence with regard to the limbs of so vile a reptile While it is an  aquatic  it has a fishlike tail and no legs as soon as the legs sprout the tail drops off as useless and the animal betakes itself to the land  Merret  I trust is widely mistaken when he advances that the  rana arborea  is an  English  reptile it abounds in  Germany  and  Switzerland  It is to be remembered that the  salamandra aquatica  of  Ray  the waternewt or eft will frequently bite at the angler's bait and is often caught on his hook I used to take it for granted that the  salamandra aquatica  was hatched lived and died in the water But  John Ellis  Esq FRS the coralline  Ellis  asserts in a letter to the Royal Society dated  June  the th in his account  of the  mud inguana  an amphibious  bipes  from  South Carolina  that the watereft or newt is only the  larva  of the landeft as tadpoles are of frogs Lest I should be suspected to misunderstand his meaning I shall give it in his own words Speaking of the  opercula  or coverings to the gills of the  mud inguana  he proceeds to say that  "The form of these pennated coverings approach very near to what I have some time ago observed in the  larva  or  aquatic  state of our  English lacerta  known by the name of eft or newt which serve them for coverings to their gills and for fins to swim with while in this state and which they lose as well as the fins of their tails when they  change  their state and  become land animals  as I have observed by keeping them alive for some time myself"  Linnaeus  in his  Systema Naturae  hints at what Mr  Ellis  advances more than once  Providence has been so indulgent to us as to allow of but one venomous reptile of the serpent kind in these kingdoms and that is the viper As you propose the good of mankind to be an object of your publications you will not omit to mention common salladoil as a sovereign remedy against the bite of the viper As to the blind worm  anguis fragilis  so called because it snaps in sunder with a small blow I have found on examination that it is perfectly innocuous A neighbouring yeoman to whom I am indebted for some good hints killed and opened a female viper about the twentyseventh of  May  he found her filled with a chain of eleven eggs about the size of those of a blackbird but none of them were advanced so far towards a state of maturity as to contain any rudiments of young Though they are oviparous yet they are viviparous also hatching their young within their bellies and then bringing them forth Whereas snakes lay  chains of eggs every summer in my melon beds in spite of all that my people can do to prevent them which eggs do not hatch till the spring following as I have often experienced Several intelligent folks assure me that they have seen the viper open her mouth and admit her helpless young down her throat on sudden surprises just as the female opossum does her brood into the pouch under her belly upon the like emergencies and yet the  London  vipercatchers insist on it to Mr  Barrington  that no such thing ever happens The serpent kind eat I believe but once in a year or rather but only just at one season of the year Country people talk much of a watersnake but I am pretty sure without any reason for the common snake  coluber natrix  delights much to sport in the water perhaps with a view to procure frogs and other food  I cannot well guess how you are to make out your twelve species of reptiles unless it be by the various species or rather varieties of our  lacerti  of which  Ray  enumerates five I have not had opportunity of ascertaining these but remember well to have seen formerly several beautiful green  lacerti  on the sunny sandbanks near  Farnham  in  Surrey  and  Ray  admits there are such in  Ireland  LETTER XVIII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  July  DEAR SIR  I RECEIVED your obliging and communicative letter of  June  the th while I was on a visit at a gentleman's house where I had neither books to turn to nor leisure to sit down to return you an answer to many queries which I wanted to resolve in the best manner that I am able  A person by my order has searched our brooks but could find no such fish as the  gasterosteus pungitius  he found the  gasterosteus aculeatus  in plenty This morning in a basket I packed a little earthen pot full of wet moss and in it some sticklebacks male and female the females big with spawn some lamperns some bulls heads but I could procure no minnows This basket will be in  Fleetstreet  by eight this evening so I hope  Mazel  will have them fresh and fair tomorrow morning I gave some directions in a letter to what particulars the engraver should be attentive  Finding while I was on a visit that I was within a reasonable distance of  Ambresbury  I sent a servant over to that town and procured several living specimens of loaches which he brought safe and brisk in a glass decanter They were taken in the gullies that were cut for watering the meadows From these fishes which measured from two to four inches in length I took the following description  "The loach in it's general aspect has a pellucid appearance it's back is mottled with irregular collections of small black dots not reaching much below the  linea lateralis  as are the back and tail fins a black line runs from each eye down to the nose it's belly is of a silvery white the upper jaw projects beyond the lower and is surrounded with six feelers three on each side it's pectoral fins are large it's ventral much smaller the fin behind it's anus small it's dorsalfin large containing eight spines it's tail where it joins to the tailfin  remarkably broad  without any taperness so as to be characteristic of this genus the tailfin is broad and square at the end From the breadth and muscular strength of the tail it appears to be an active nimble fish"  In my visit I was not very far from  Hungerford  and did not forget to make some inquiries concerning the wonderful method of curing cancers by means of toads Several intelligent persons both gentry and clergy do I find give a great deal of credit to what was asserted in the papers and I myself dined with a clergyman who seemed to be persuaded that what is related is matter of fact but when I came to attend to his account I thought I discerned circumstances which did not a little invalidate the woman's story of the manner in which she came by her skill She says of herself  "that labouring under a virulent cancer she went to some church where there was a vast crowd on going into a pew shew was accosted by a strange clergyman who after expressing compassion for her situation told her that if she would make such an application of living toads as is mentioned she would be well"  Now is it likely that this unknown gentleman should express so much tenderness for this single sufferer and not feel any for the many thousands that daily languish under this terrible disorder Would he not have made use of this invaluable nostrum for his own emolument or at least by  some means of publication or other have found a method of making it public for the good of mankind In short this woman as it appears to me having set up for a cancerdoctress finds it expedient to amuse the country with this dark and mysterious relation  The watereft has not that I can discern the least appearance of any gills for want of which it is continually rising to the surface of the water to take in fresh air I opened a bigbellied one indeed and found it full of spawn Not that this circumstance at all invalidates the assertion that they are  larvae  for the  larvae  of insects are full of eggs which they exclude the instant they enter their last state The watereft is continually climbing over the brims of the vessel within which we keep it in water and wandering away and people every summer see numbers crawling out of the pools where they are hatched up the dry banks There are varieties of them differing in colour and some have fins up their tail and back and some have not  LETTER XIX TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Aug  DEAR SIR  I HAVE now past dispute made out three distinct species of the willowwrens  motacillae trochili  which  constantly  and  invariably  use distinct notes But at the same time I am obliged to confess that I know nothing of your willowlark  Brit Zool  edit octavo p  In my letter  of  April  the th I had told you peremptorily that I knew your willowlark but had not seen it then but when I came to procure it it proved in all respects a very  motacilla trochilus  only that it is a size larger than the two other and the yellowgreen of the whole upper part of the body is more vivid and the belly of a clearer white I have specimens of the three sorts now lying before me and can discern that there are three gradations of sizes and that the least has black legs and the other two fleshcoloured ones The yellowest bird is considerably the largest and has it's quillfeathers and secondary feathers tipped with white which the others have not This last haunts only the tops of trees in high beechen woods and makes a sibilous grasshopperlike noise now and then at short intervals shivering a little with it's wings when it sings and is I make no doubt now the  regulus non cristatus  of  Ray  which he says  "  cantat voce stridulâ locustae  "  Yet this great ornithologist never suspected that there were three species  LETTER XX TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  October  IT is I find in  zoology  as it is in  botany  all nature is so full that that district produces the greatest variety which is the most examined Several birds which are said to belong to the north only are it seems often in the south I have discovered this  summer three species of birds with us which writers mention as only to be seen in the northern counties The first that was brought me on the th of  May  was the sandpiper  tringa hypoleucus  it was a cock bird and haunted the banks of some ponds near the village and as it had a companion doubtless intended to have bred near that water Besides the owner has told me since that on recollection he has seen some of the same birds round his ponds in former summers  The next bird that I procured on the st of  May  was a male redbacked butcher bird  lanius collurio  My neighbour who shot it says that it might easily have escaped his notice had not the outcries and chattering of the whitethroats and other small birds drawn his attention to the bush where it was it's craw was filled with the legs and wings of beetles  The next rare birds which were procured for me last week were some ringousels  turdi torquati  This week twelve months a gentleman from  London  being with us was amusing himself with a gun and found he told us on an old yew hedge where there were berries some birds like blackbirds with rings of white round their necks a neighbouring farmer also at the same time observed the same but as no specimens were procured little notice was taken I mentioned this circumstance to you in my letter of  November  the th you however paid but small regard to what I said as I had not seen these birds myself but last week the aforesaid farmer seeing a large flock twenty or thirty of these birds shot two cocks and two hens and says on recollection that he remembers to have observed these birds again last spring about  Ladyday  as it were on their return to the north Now perhaps these ousels are not the ousels of the north of  England  but belong to the more northern parts of  Europe  and may retire before the excessive rigor of the frosts in those parts and return to breed in the spring when the cold abates If this be the case here is discovered a new bird of winter passage concerning whose migrations the writers are silent but if these birds should prove the ousels of the north of  England  then here is a migration disclosed within our own kingdom never before remarked It does not yet appear whether they retire beyond the bounds of our island to the south but it is most probable that they usually do or else one cannot suppose that they would have continued so long unnoticed in the southern counties The ousel is larger than a blackbird and feeds on haws but last autumn when there were no haws it fed on yewberries in the spring it feeds on ivyberries which ripen only at that season in  March  and  April  I must not omit to tell you as you have been so lately on the study of reptiles that my people every now and then of late draw up with a bucket of water from my well which is feet deep a large black warty lizard with a fintail and yellow belly How they first came down at that depth and how they were ever to have got out thence without help is more than I am able to say  My thanks are due to you for your trouble and care in the examination of a buck's head As far as your discoveries reach at present they seem much to corroborate my suspicions and I hope Mr may find reason to give his decision in my favour and then I think we may advance this extraordinary provision of nature as a new instance of the wisdom of God in the creation  As yet I have not quite done with my history of the  oedicnemus  or stonecurlew for I shall desire a gentleman in  Sussex  near whose house these birds congregate in vast flocks in the autumn  to observe nicely when they leave him if they do leave him and when they return again in the spring I was with this gentleman lately and saw several single birds  LETTER XXI TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Nov  DEAR SIR  WITH regard to the  oedicnemus  or stonecurlew I intend to write very soon to my friend near  Chichester  in whose neighbourhood these birds seem most to abound and shall urge him to take particular notice when they begin to congregate and afterwards to watch them most narrowly whether they do not withdraw themselves during the dead of the winter When I have obtained information with respect to this circumstance I shall have finished my history of the  stonecurlew  which I hope will prove to your satisfaction as it will be I trust very near the truth This gentleman as he occupies a large farm of his own and is abroad early and late will be a very proper spy upon the motions of these birds and besides as I have prevailed on him to buy the Naturalist's Journal with which he is much delighted I shall expect that he will be very exact in his dates It is very extraordinary as you observe that a bird so common with us should never straggle to you  And here will be the properest place to mention while I think of it an anecdote which the abovementioned gentleman told me  when I was last at his house which was that in a warren joining to his outlet many daws  corvi monedulae  build every year in the rabbitburrows under ground The way he and his brothers used to take their nests while they were boys was by listening at the mouths of the holes and if they heard the young ones cry they twisted the nest out with a forked stick Some waterfowls  viz  the puffins breed I know in that manner but I should never have suspected the daws of building in holes on the flat ground  Another very unlikely spot is made use of by daws as a place to breed in and that is  Stonehenge  These birds deposit their nests in the interstices between the upright and the impost stones of that amazing work of antiquity which circumstance alone speaks the prodigious height of the upright stones that they should be tall enough to secure those nests from the annoyance of shepherdboys who are always idling round that place  One of my neighbours last  Saturday November  the th saw a martin in a sheltered bottom the sun shone warm and the bird was hawking briskly after flies I am now perfectly satisfied that they do not all leave this island in the winter  You judge very right I think in speaking with reserve and caution concerning the cures done by toads for let people advance what they will on such subjects yet there is such a propensity in mankind towards deceiving and being deceived that one cannot safely relate any thing from common report especially in print without expressing some degree of doubt and suspicion  Your approbation with regard to my new discovery of the migration of the ringousel gives me satisfaction and I find you concur with me in suspecting that they are foreign birds which visit us You will be sure I hope not to omit to make inquiry whether your ringousels leave your rocks in the autumn What  puzzles me most is the very short stay they make with us for in about three weeks they are all gone I shall be very curious to remark whether they will call on us at their return in the spring as they did last year  I want to be better informed with regard to icthyology If fortune had settled me near the seaside or near some great river my natural propensity would soon have urged me to have made myself acquainted with their productions but as I have lived mostly in inland parts and in an upland district my knowledge of fishes extends little farther than to those common sorts which our brooks and lakes produce  I am c  LETTER XXII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Jan  DEAR SIR  AS to the peculiarity of jackdaws building with us under the ground in rabbitburrows you have in part hit upon the reason for in reality there are hardly any towers or steeples in all this country And perhaps  Norfolk  excepted  Hampshire  and  Sussex  are as meanly furnished with churches as almost any counties in the kingdom We have many livings of two or three hundred pounds a year whose houses of worship make little better appearance than dovecots When I first saw  Northamptonshire Cambridgeshire  and  Huntingdonshire  and the fens of  Lincolnshire  I was amazed at the number of spires which presented themselves in every point of view As an admirer of prospects I have reason to lament this want in my own country for such objects are very necessary ingredients in an elegant landscape  What you mention with respect to reclaimed toads raises my curiosity An ancient author though no naturalist has well remarked that  "  Every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind  James  chap iii  "  It is a satisfaction to me to find that a green lizard has actually been procured for you in  Devonshire  because it corroborates my discovery which I made many years ago of the same sort on a sunny sandbank near  Farnham  in  Surrey  I am well acquainted with the south hams of  Devonshire  and can suppose that district from it's southerly situation to be a proper habitation for such animals in their best colours  Since the ringousels of your vast mountains do certainly not forsake them against winter our suspicions that those which visit this neighbourhood about  Michaelmas  are not  English  birds but driven from the more northern parts of  Europe  by the frosts are still more reasonable and it will be worth your pains to endeavour to trace from whence they come and to inquire why they make so very short a stay  In your account of your error with regard to the two species of herons you incidentally gave me great entertainment in your description of the heronry at  Cressihall  which is a curiosity I never could manage to see Fourscore nests of such a bird on one tree is a rarity which I would ride half as many miles to have a  sight of Pray be sure to tell me in your next whose seat  Cressihall  is and near what town it lies  Cressihall  is near  Spalding  in  Lincolnshire  I have often thought that those vast extents of fens have never been sufficiently explored If half a dozen gentlemen furnished with a good strength of waterspaniels were to beat them over for a week they would certainly find more species  There is no bird I believe whose manners I have studied more than that of the  caprimulgus  the goatsucker as it is a wonderful and curious creature but I have always found that though sometimes it may chatter as it flies as I know it does yet in general it utters it's jarring note sitting on a bough and I have for many an half hour watched it as it sat with it's under mandible quivering and particularly this summer It perches usually on a bare twig with it's head lower than it's tail in an attitude well expressed by your draughtsman in the folio  British Zoology  This bird is most punctual in beginning it's song exactly at the close of day so exactly that I have known it strike up more than once or twice just at the report of the  Portsmouth  evening gun which we can hear when the weather is still It appears to me past all doubt that it's notes are formed by organic impulse by the powers of the parts of it's windpipe formed for sound just as cats put You will credit me I hope when I assure you that as my neighbours were assembled in an  See the vignette in this book  hermitage on the side of a steep hill where we drink tea one of these churnowls came and settled on the cross of that little straw edifice and began to chatter and continued his note for many minutes and we were all struck with wonder to find that the organs of that little animal when put in motion gave a sensible vibration to the whole building This  bird also sometimes makes a small squeak repeated four or five times and I have observed that to happen when the cock has been pursuing the hen in a toying way through the boughs of a tree  It would not be at all strange if your bat which you have procured should prove a new one since five species have been found in a neighbouring kingdom The great sort that I mentioned is certainly a nondescript I saw but one this summer and that I had no opportunity of taking  Your account of the  Indiangrass  was entertaining I am no angler myself but inquiring of those that are what they supposed that part of their tackle to be made of they replied  "of the intestines of a silkworm"  Though I must not pretend to great skill in entomology yet I cannot say that I am ignorant of that kind of knowledge I may now and then perhaps be able to furnish you with a little information  The vast rains ceased with us much about the same time as with you and since we have had delicate weather Mr  Barker  who has measured the rain for more than thirty years says in a late letter that more has fallen this year than in any he ever attended to though from  July  to  January  more fell than in any seven months of this year  LETTER XXIII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  February  DEAR SIR  IT is not improbable that the  Guernsey  lizard and our green lizards may be specifically the same all that I know is that when some years ago many  Guernsey  lizards were turned loose in  Pembroke  college garden in the university of  Oxford  they lived a great while and seemed to enjoy themselves very well but never bred Whether this circumstance will prove any thing either way I shall not pretend to say  I return you thanks for your account of  Cressihall  but recollect not without regret that in  June  I was visiting for a week together at  Spalding  without ever being told that such a curiosity was just at hand Pray send me word in your next what sort of tree it is that contains such a quantity of herons' nests and whether the heronry consists of a whole grove or wood or only of a few trees  It gave me satisfaction to find we accorded so well about the  caprimulgus  all I contended for was to prove that it often chatters sitting as well as flying and therefore the noise was voluntary and from organic impulse and not from the resistance of the air against the hollow of it's mouth and throat  If ever I saw any thing like actual migration it was last  Michaelmasday  I was travelling and out early in the morning at first there was a vast fog but by the time that I was got seven or eight miles from home towards the coast the sun broke out into a  delicate warm day We were then on a large heath or common and I could discern as the mist began to break away great numbers of swallows  hirundines rusticae  clustering on the stunted shrubs and bushes as if they had roosted there all night As soon as the air became clear and pleasant they all were on the wing at once and by a placid and easy flight proceeded on southward towards the sea after this I did not see any more flocks only now and then a straggler  I cannot agree with those persons that assert that the swallow kind disappear some and some gradually as they come for the bulk of them seem to withdraw at once only some stragglers stay behind a long while and do never there is the greatest reason to believe leave this island Swallows seem to lay themselves up and to come forth in a warm day as bats do continually of a warm evening after they have disappeared for weeks For a very respectable gentleman assured me that as he was walking with some friends under  Mertonwall  on a remarkably hot noon either in the last week in  December  or the first week in  January  he espied three or four swallows huddled together on the moulding of one of the windows of that college I have frequently remarked that swallows are seen later at  Oxford  than elsewhere is it owing to the vast massy buildings of that place to the many waters round it or to what else  When I used to rise in a morning last autumn and see the swallows and martins clustering on the chimnies and thatch of the neighbouring cottages I could not help being touched with a secret delight mixed with some degree of mortification with delight to observe with how much ardour and punctuality those poor little birds obeyed the strong impulse towards migration or hiding imprinted on their minds by their great Creator and with some degree of mortification when I reflected that after all our  pains and inquiries we are yet not quite certain to what regions they do migrate and are still farther embarassed to find that some do not actually migrate at all  These reflections made so strong an impression on my imagination that they became productive of a composition that may perhaps amuse you for a quarter of an hour when next I have the honour of writing to you  LETTER XXIV TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  May  DEAR SIR  THE  scarabaeus fullo  I know very well having seen it in collections but have never been able to discover one wild in it's natural state Mr  Banks  told me he thought it might be found on the seacoast  On the thirteenth of  April  I went to the sheepdown where the  ringousels  have been observed to make their appearance at spring and fall in their way perhaps to the north or south and was much pleased to see three birds about the usual spot We shot a cock and a hen they were plump and in high condition The hen had but very small rudiments of eggs within her which proves they are late breeders whereas those species of the thrush kind that remain with us the whole year have fledged young before that time In their crops was nothing very distinguishable but somewhat that seemed like blades of vegetables nearly digested In  autumn they feed on haws and yewberries and in the spring on ivyberries I dressed one of these birds and found it juicy and well flavoured It is remarkable that they make but a few days stay in their spring visit but rest near a fortnight at  Michaelmas  These birds from the observations of three springs and two autumns are most punctual in their return and exhibit a new migration unnoticed by the writers who supposed they never were to be seen in any of the southern counties  One of my neighbours lately brought me a new  salicaria  which at first I suspected might have proved your willowlark  For this  salicaria  see letter  August    but on a nicer examination it answered much better to the description of that species which you shot at  Revesby  in  Lincolnshire  My bird I describe thus  "It is a size less than the grasshopperlark the head back and coverts of the wings of a dusky brown without those dark spots of the grasshopperlark over each eye is a milkwhite stroke the chin and throat are white and the under parts of a yellowish white the rump is tawny and the feathers of the tail sharppointed the bill is dusky and sharp and the legs are dusky the hinder claw long and crooked"  The person that shot it says that it sung so like a reedsparrow that he took it for one and that it sings all night but this account merits farther inquiry For my part I suspect it is a second sort of  locustella  hinted at by Dr  Derham  in  Ray's Letters  see p He also procured me a grasshopperlark  The question that you put with regard to those genera of animals that are peculiar to  America  viz how they came there and whence is too puzzling for me to answer and yet so obvious as often to have struck me with wonder If one looks into the writers  on that subject little satisfaction is to be found Ingenious men will readily advance plausible arguments to support whatever theory they shall chuse to maintain but then the misfortune is every one's hypothesis is each as good as another's since they are all founded on conjecture The late writers of this sort in whom may be seen all the arguments of those that have gone before as I remember stock  America  from the western coast of  Africa  and the south of  Europe  and then break down the Isthmus that bridged over the  Atlantic  But this is making use of a violent piece of machinery it is a difficulty worthy of the interposition of a god  "  Incredulus odi  "

THE SAME  SELBORNE  Aug  DEAR SIR  IT gives me satisfaction to find that my account of the  ousel migration  pleases you You put a very shrewd question when you ask me how I know that their autumnal migration is southward  Was not candour and openness the very life of natural history I should pass over this query just as a sly commentator does over a crabbed passage in a classic but common ingenuousness obliges me to confess not without some degree of shame that I only reasoned in that case from analogy For as all other autumnal birds migrate from the northward to us to partake of our milder winters and return to the northward again when the rigorous cold abates so I concluded that the ringousels did the same as well as their congeners the fieldfares and especially as ringousels are known to haunt cold mountainous countries but I have good reason to suspect since that they may come to us from the westward because I hear from very good authority that they breed on  Dartmore  and that they forsake that wild district about the time that our visitors appear and do not return till late in the spring  I have taken a great deal of pains about your  salicaria  and mine with a white stroke over it's eye and a tawny rump I have surveyed it alive and dead and have procured several specimens and am perfectly persuaded myself and trust you will soon be convinced of the same that it is no more nor less than the  passer arundinaceus minor  of  Ray  This bird by some means or other seems to be entirely omitted in the  British Zoology  and one reason probably was because it is so strangely classed in  Ray  who ranges it among his  picis affines  It ought no doubt to have gone among his  aviculae caudâ unicolore  and among your slenderbilled small birds of the same division  Linnaeus  might with great propriety have put it into his genus of  motacilla  and the  motacilla salicaria  of his  fauna suecica  seems to come the nearest to it It is no uncommon bird haunting the sides of ponds and rivers where there is covert and the reeds and sedges of moors The country people in some places call it the  sedgebird  It sings incessantly night and  day during the breedingtime imitating the note of a sparrow a swallow a skylark and has a strange hurrying manner in it's song My specimens correspond most minutely to the description of your  fen salicaria  shot near  Revesby  Mr  Ray  has given an excellent characteristic of it when he says  "  Rostrum pedes in hâc aviculâ multò majores sunt quâm pro corporis ratione  "  See letter  May    I have got you the egg of an  oedicnemus  or stonecurlew which was picked up in a fallow on the naked ground there were two but the finder inadvertently crushed one with his foot before he saw them  When I wrote to you last year on reptiles I wish I had not forgot to mention the faculty that snakes have of stinking  se defendendo  I knew a gentleman who kept a tame snake which was in it's person as sweet as any animal while in good humour and unalarmed but as soon as a stranger or a dog or cat came in it fell to hissing and filled the room with such nauseous effluvia as rendered it hardly supportable Thus the squnck or stonck of  Ray's Synop Quadr  is an innocuous and sweet animal but when pressed hard by dogs and men it can eject such a most pestilent and fetid smell and excrement that nothing can be more horrible  A gentleman sent me lately a fine specimen of the  lanius minor cinerascens cum maculâ in scapulis albâ Raii  which is a bird that at the time of your publishing your two first volumes of  British Zoology  I find you had not seen You have described it well from  Edwards  's drawing  LETTER XXVI TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  December  DEAR SIR  I WAS much gratified by your communicative letter on your return from  Scotland  where you spent I find some considerable time and gave yourself good room to examine the natural curiosities of that extensive kingdom both those of the islands as well as those of the highlands The usual bane of such expeditions is hurry because men seldom allot themselves half the time they should do but fixing on a day for their return post from place to place rather as if they were on a journey that required dispatch than as philosophers investigating the works of nature You must have made no doubt many discoveries and laid up a good fund of materials for a future edition of the  British Zoology  and will have no reason to repent that you have bestowed so much pains on a part of  GreatBritian  that perhaps was never so well examined before  It has always been matter of wonder to me that fieldfares which are so congenerous to thrushes and blackbirds should never chuse to breed in  England  but that they should not think even the highlands cold and northerly and sequestered enough is a circumstance still more strange and wonderful The ringousel you find stays in  Scotland  the whole year round so that we have reason to conclude that those migrators that visit us for a short space every autumn do not come from thence  And here I think will be the proper place to mention that those birds were most punctual again in their migration this autumn appearing as before about the th of  September  but their flocks were larger than common and their stay protracted somewhat beyond the usual time If they came to spend the whole winter with us as some of their congeners do and then left us as they do in spring I should not be so much struck with the occurrence since it would be similar to that of the other winter birds of passage but when I see them for a fortnight at  Michaelmas  and again for about a week in the middle of  April  I am seized with wonder and long to be informed whence these travellers come and whither they go since they seem to use our hills merely as an inn or baiting place  Your account of the greater brambling or snowfleck is very amusing and strange it is that such a shortwinged bird should delight in such perilous voyages over the northern ocean Some country people in the winter time have every now and then told me that they have seen two or three white larks on our downs but on considering the matter I begin to suspect that these are some stragglers of the birds we are talking of which sometimes perhaps may rove so far to the southward  It pleases me to find that white hares are so frequent on the  Scottish  mountains and especially as you inform me that it is a distinct species for the quadrupeds of  Britain  are so few that every new species is a great acquisition  The eagleowl could it be proved to belong to us is so majestic a bird that it would grace our  fauna  much I never was informed before where wildgeese are known to breed  You admit I find that I have proved your  fensalicaria  to be the lesser reedsparrow of  Ray  and I think you may be secure  that I am right for I took very particular pains to clear up that matter and had some fair specimens but as they were not well preserved they are decayed already You will no doubt insert it in it's proper place in your next edition Your additional plates will much improve your work  De Buffon  I know has described the water shrewmouse but still I am pleased to find you have discovered it in  Lincolnshire  for the reason I have given in the article of the white hare  As a neighbour was lately plowing in a dry chalky field far removed from any water he turned out a waterrat that was curiously laid up in an  hybernaculum  artificially formed of grass and leaves At one end of the  burrow  lay above a gallon of potatoes regularly stowed on which it was to have supported itself for the winter But the difficulty with me is how this  amphibius mus  came to fix it's winter station at such a distance from the water Was it determined in it's choice of that place by the mere accident of finding the potatoes which were planted there or is it the constant practice of the aquaticrat to forsake the neighbourhood of the water in the colder months  Though I delight very little in analogous reasoning knowing how fallacious it is with respect to natural history yet in the following instance I cannot help being inclined to think it may conduce towards the explanation of a difficulty that I have mentioned before with respect to the invariable early retreat of the  hirundo apus  or swift so many weeks before it's congeners and that not only with us but also in  Andalusia  where they also begin to retire about the beginning of  August  The great large bat  The little bat appears almost every month in the year but I have never seen the large ones till the end of  April  nor after  July  They are most common in  June  but never in any plenty are a rare species with us  which by the by is at present a nondescript  in  England  and what I have never been able yet to procure retires or migrates very early in the summer it also ranges very high for it's food feeding in a different region of the air and that is the reason I never could procure one Now this is exactly the case with the swifts for they take their food in a more exalted region than the other species and are very seldom seen hawking for flies near the ground or over the surface of the water From hence I would conclude that these  hirundines  and the larger bats are supported by some sorts of highflying gnats scarabs or  phalaenae  that are of short continuance and that the short stay of these strangers is regulated by the defect of their food  By my journal it appears that curlews clamoured on to  October  the thirtyfirst since which I have not seen or heard any Swallows were observed on to  November  the third  LETTER XXVII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Feb  DEAR SIR  HEDGEHOGS abound in my gardens and fields The manner in which they eat their roots of the plantain in my grasswalks is very curious with their upper mandible which is much longer than their lower they bore under the plant and so eat the root off upwards leaving the tuft of leaves untouched In this respect they  are serviceable as they destroy a very troublesome weed but they deface the walks in some measure by digging little round holes It appears by the dung that they drop upon the turf that beetles are no inconsiderable part of their food In  June  last I procured a litter of four or five young hedgehogs which appeared to be about five or six days old they I find like puppies are born blind and could not see when they came to my hands No doubt their spines are soft and flexible at the time of their birth or else the poor dam would have but a bad time of it in the critical moment of parturition but it is plain that they soon harden for these little pigs had such stiff prickles on their backs and sides as would easily have fetched blood had they not been handled with caution Their spines are quite white at this age and they have little hanging ears which I do not remember to be discernible in the old ones They can in part at this age draw their skin down over their faces but are not able to contract themselves into a ball as they do for the sake of defence when full grown The reason I suppose is because the curious muscle that enables the creature to roll itself up in a ball was not then arrived at it's full tone and firmness Hedgehogs make a deep and warm  hybernaculum  with leaves and moss in which they conceal themselves for the winter but I never could find that they stored in any winter provision as some quadrupeds certainly do  I have discovered an anecdote with respect to the fieldfare  turdus pilaris  which I think is particular enough this bird though it sits on trees in the daytime and procures the greatest part of it's food from whitethorn hedges yea moreover builds on very high trees as may be seen by the  fauna suecica  yet always appears with us to roost on the ground They are seen to come in flocks just before it is dark and to settle and nestle  among the heath on our forest And besides the larkers in dragging their nets by night frequently catch them in the wheatstubbles while the batfowlers who take many redwings in the hedges never entangle any of this species Why these birds in the matter of roosting should differ from all their congeners and from themselves also with respect to their proceedings by day is a fact for which I am by no means able to account  I have somewhat to inform you of concerning the  moosedeer  but in general foreign animals fall seldom in my way my little intelligence is confined to the narrow sphere of my own observations at home  LETTER XXVIII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  March  ON  Michaelmasday  I managed to get a sight of the female moose belonging to the duke of  Richmond  at  Goodwood  but was greatly disappointed when I arrived at the spot to find that it died after having appeared in a languishing way for some time on the morning before However understanding that it was not stripped I proceeded to examine this rare quadruped I found it in an old greenhouse slung under the belly and chin by ropes and in a standing posture but though it had been dead for so short a time it was in so putrid a state that the stench was hardly  supportable The grand distinction between this deer and any other species that I have ever met with consisted in the strange length of it's legs on which it was tilted up much in the manner of the birds of the  grallae  order I measured it as they do an horse and found that from the ground to the wither it was just five feet four inches which height answers exactly to sixteen hands a growth that few horses arrive at but then with this length of legs it's neck was remarkably short no more than twelve inches so that by straddling with one foot forward and the other backward it grazed on the plain ground with the greatest difficulty between it's legs the ears were vast and lopping and as long as the neck the head was about twenty inches long and asslike and had such a redundancy of upper lip as I never saw before with huge nostrils This lip travellers say is esteemed a dainty dish in  North America  It is very reasonable to suppose that this creature supports itself chiefly by browsing of trees and by wading after water plants towards which way of livelihood the length of legs and great lip must contribute much I have read somewhere that it delights in eating the  nymphaea  or waterlily From the forefeet to the belly behind the shoulder it measured three feet and eight inches the length of the legs before and behind consisted a great deal in the  tibia  which was strangely long but in my haste to get out of the stench I forgot to measure that joint exactly It's scut seemed to be about an inch long the colour was a grizzly black the mane about four inches long the forehoofs were upright and shapely the hind flat and splayed The spring before it was only two years old so that most probably it was not then come to it's growth What a vast tall beast must a full grown stag be I have been told some arrive at ten feet and an half This poor creature had at first a female companion of the  same species which died the spring before In the same garden was a young stag or red deer between whom and this moose it was hoped that there might have been a breed but their inequality of height must have always been a bar to any commerce of the amorous kind I should have been glad to have examined the teeth tongue lips hoofs c minutely but the putrefaction precluded all farther curiosity This animal the keeper told me seemed to enjoy itself best in the extreme frost of the former winter In the house they shewed me the horn of a male moose which had no frontantlers but only a broad palm with some snags on the edge The noble owner of the dead moose proposed to make a skeleton of her bones  Please to let me hear if my female moose corresponds with that you saw and whether you think still that the  American  moose and  European  elk are the same creature  I am With the greatest esteem c  LETTER XXIX TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  May  DEAR SIR  LAST month we had such a series of cold turbulent weather such a constant succession of frost and snow and hail and tempest that the regular migration or appearance of the summer birds was much interrupted Some did not shew themselves at  least were not heard till weeks after their usual time as the  blackcap  and  whitethroat  and some have not been heard yet as the  grasshopperlark  and largest  willowwren  As to the  flycatcher  I have not seen it it is indeed one of the latest but should appear about this time and yet amidst all this meteorous strife and war of the elements two swallows discovered themselves as long ago as the eleventh of  April  in frost and snow but they withdrew quickly and were not visible again for many days Housemartins which are always more backward than swallows were not observed till  May  came in  Among the  monogamous  birds several are to be found after pairingtime single and of each sex but whether this state of celibacy is matter of choice or necessity is not so easily discoverable When the housesparrows deprive my martins of their nests as soon as I cause one to be shot the other be it cock or hen presently procures a mate and so for several times following  I have known a dovehouse infested by a pair of white owls which made great havock among the young pigeons one of the owls was shot as soon as possible but the survivor readily found a mate and the mischief went on After some time the new pair were both destroyed and the annoyance ceased  Another instance I remember of a sportsman whose zeal for the increase of his game being greater than his humanity after pairingtime he always shot the cockbird of every couple of partridges upon his grounds supposing that the rivalry of many males interrupted the breed he used to say that though he had widowed the same hen several times yet he found she was still provided with a fresh paramour that did not take her away from her usual haunt  Again I knew a lover of setting an old sportsman who has  often told me that soon after harvest he has frequently taken small coveys of partridges consisting of cockbirds alone these he pleasantly used to call old bachelors  There is a propensity belonging to common housecats that is very remarkable I mean their violent fondness for fish which appears to be their most favourite food and yet nature in this instance seems to have planted in them an appetite that unassisted they know not how to gratify for of all quadrupeds cats are the least disposed towards water and will not when they can avoid it deign to wet a foot much less to plunge into that element  Quadrupeds that prey on fish are amphibious such is the otter which by nature is so well formed for diving that it makes great havock among the inhabitants of the waters Not supposing that we had any of those beasts in our shallow brooks I was much pleased to see a male otter brought to me weighing twentyone pounds that had been shot on the bank of our stream below the  Priory  where the rivulet divides the parish of  Selborne  from  Harteleywood  LETTER XXX TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Aug  DEAR SIR  THE  French  I think in general are strangely prolix in their natural history What  Linnaeus  says with respect to insects holds good in every other branch  "  Verbositas praesentis saeculi calamitas artis  "  Pray how do you approve of  Scopoli  's new work as I admire his  Entomologia  I long to see it  I forgot to mention in my last letter and had not room to insert in the former that the male moose in rutting time swims from island to island in the lakes and rivers of  NorthAmerica  in pursuit of the females My friend the chaplain saw one killed in the water as it was on that errand in the river St  Lawrence  it was a monstrous beast he told me but he did not take the dimensions  When I was last in town our friend Mr  Barrington  most obligingly carried me to see many curious sights As you were then writing to him about horns he carried me to see many strange and wonderful specimens There is I remember at Lord  Pembroke  's at  Wilton  an horn room furnished with more than thirty different pairs but I have not seen that house lately  Mr  Barrington  shewed me many astonishing collections of stuffed and living birds from all quarters of the world After I had studied over the latter for a time I remarked that every species almost that came from distant regions such as  South America  the coast of  Guinea  c were thickbilled birds of the  loxia  and  fringilla  genera and no  motacillae  or  muscicapae  were to be met with When I came to consider the reason was obvious enough for the hardbilled birds subsist on seeds which are easily carried on board while the softbilled birds which are supported by worms and insects or what is a  succedaneum  for them fresh raw meat can meet with neither in long and tedious voyages It is from this defect of food that our collections curious as they are are defective and we are deprived of some of the most delicate and lively genera  I am c  LETTER XXXI TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Sept  DEAR SIR  YOU saw I find the ringousels again among their native crags and are farther assured that they continue resident in those cold regions the whole year From whence then do our ringousels migrate so regularly every  September  and make their appearance again as if in their return every  April  They are more early this year than common for some were seen at the usual hill on the fourth of this month  An observing  Devonshire  gentleman tells me that they frequent some parts of  Dartmoor  and breed there but leave those haunts about the end of  September  or beginning of  October  and return again about the end of  March  Another intelligent person assures me that they breed in great abundance all over the  Peak  of  Derby  and are called there  Torousels  withdraw in  October  and  November  and return in spring This information seems to throw some light on my new migration  Scopoli  's  Annus Primus HistoricoNaturalis  new work which I have just procured has it's merit in ascertaining many of the birds of the  Tirol  and  Carniola  Monographers come from whence they may have I think fair pretence to challenge some regard and approbation from the  lovers of natural history for as no man can alone investigate all the works of nature these partial writers may each in their department be more accurate in their discoveries and freer from errors than more general writers and so by degrees may pave the way to an universal correct natural history Not that  Scopoli  is so circumstantial and attentive to the life and conversation of his birds as I could wish he advances some false facts as when he says of the  hirundo urbica  that  "  pullos extra nidum non nutrit  "  This assertion I know to be wrong from repeated observation this summer for housemartins do feed their young flying though it must be acknowledged not so commonly as the houseswallow and the feat is done in so quick a manner as not to be perceptible to indifferent observers He also advances some I was going to say improbable facts as when he says of the woodcock that  "  pullos rostro portat fugiens ab hoste  "  But candour forbids me to say absolutely that any fact is false because I have never been witness to such a fact I have only to remark that the long unweildy bill of the woodcock is perhaps the worst adapted of any among the winged creation for such a feat of natural affection  I am c  LETTER XXXII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  October  DEAR SIR  AFTER an ineffectual search in  Linnaeus Brisson  c I begin to suspect that I discern my brother's  hirundo hyberna  in  Scopoli  's new discovered  hirundo rupestris  p His description of  "  Supra murina subtus albida rectrices maculâ ovali albâ in latere interno pedes nudi nigri rostrum nigrum remiges obscuriores quam plumae dorsales rectrices remigibus concolores caudâ emarginatâ nec forcipatâ  "  agrees very well with the bird in question but when he comes to advance that it is  "  statura hirundinis urbicae  "  and that  "  definitio hirundinis ripariae Linnaei huic quoque convenit  "  he in some measure invalidates all he has said at least he shews at once that he compares them to these species merely from memory for I have compared the birds themselves and find they differ widely in every circumstance of shape size and colour However as you will have a specimen I shall be glad to hear what your judgment is in the matter  Whether my brother is forestalled in his nondescript or not he will have the credit of first discovering that they spend their winters under the warm and sheltery shores of  Gibraltar  and  Barbary  Scopoli  's characters of his ordines and genera are clean just and expressive and much in the spirit of  Linnaeus  These few remarks are the result of my first perusal of  Scopoli's Annus Primus  The bane of our science is the comparing one animal to the other by memory for want of caution in this particular  Scopoli  falls into errors he is not so full with regard to the manners of his indigenous birds as might be wished as you justly observe his Latin is easy elegant and expressive and very superior to  Kramer  's  See his  Elenchus vegetabilium et animalium per Austriam inferiorem c    I am pleased to see that my description of the  moose  corresponds so well with yours  I am c  LETTER XXXIII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Nov  DEAR SIR  I WAS much pleased to see among the collection of birds from  Gibraltar  some of those shortwinged  English  summerbirds of passage concerning whose departure we have made so much inquiry Now if these birds are found in  Andalusia  to migrate to and from  Barbary  it may easily be supposed that those that come to us may migrate back to the continent and spend their winters in some of the warmer parts of  Europe  This is certain that many softbilled birds that come to  Gibraltar  appear there only in spring and autumn seeming to advance in pairs towards the northward for the sake of breeding during the summer months  and retiring in parties and broods towards the south at the decline of the year so that the rock of  Gibraltar  is the great rendezvous and place of observation from whence they take their departure each way towards  Europe  or  Africa  It is therefore no mean discovery I think to find that our small shortwinged summer birds of passage are to be seen spring and autumn on the very skirts of  Europe  it is a presumptive proof of their emigrations  Scopoli  seems to me to have found the  hirundo melba  the great  Gibraltar  swift in  Tirol  without knowing it For what is his  hirundo alpina  but the aforementioned bird in other words Says he  "  Omnia prioris  "  meaning the swift  "  sed pectus album paulo major priore  "  I do not suppose this to be a new species It is true also of the  melba  that  "  nidificat in excelsis Alpium rupibus  "  Vid Annum Primum  My  Sussex  friend a man of observation and good sense but no naturalist to whom I applied on account of the  stonecurlew oedicnemus  sends me the following account  "In looking over my Naturalist's Journal for the month of  April  I find the  stonecurlews  are first mentioned on the seventeenth and eighteenth which date seems to me rather late They live with us all the spring and summer and at the beginning of autumn prepare to take leave by getting together in flocks They seem to me a bird of passage that may travel into some dry hilly country south of us probably Spain because of the abundance of sheepwalks in that country for they spend their summers with us in such districts This conjecture I hazard as I have never met with any one that has seen them in  England  in the winter I believe they are not fond of going near the water but feed on earthworms that are common on sheepwalks and downs They breed on fallows and layfields abounding with  grey mossy flints which much resemble their young in colour among which they skulk and conceal themselves They make no nest but lay their eggs on the bare ground producing in common but two at a time There is reason to think their young run soon after they are hatched and that the old ones do not feed them but only lead them about at the time of feeding which for the most part is in the night"  Thus far my friend  In the manners of this bird you see there is something very analogous to the bustard whom it also somewhat resembles in aspect and make and in the structure of it's feet  For a long time I have desired my relation to look out for these birds in  Andalusia  and now he writes me word that for the first time he saw one dead in the market on the third of  September  When the  oedicnemus  flies it stretches out it's legs straight behind like an heron  I am c  LETTER XXXIV TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  March  DEAR SIR  THERE is an insect with us especially on chalky districts which is very troublesome and teasing all the latter end of the summer getting into people's skins especially those of women and children  and raising tumours which itch intolerably This animal which we call an harvest bug is very minute scarce discernible to the naked eye of a bright scarlet colour and of the genus of  Acarus  They are to be met with in gardens on kidneybeans or any legumens but prevail only in the hot months of summer Warreners as some have assured me are much infested by them on chalky downs where these insects swarm sometimes to so infinite a degree as to discolour their nets and to give them a reddish cast while the men are so bitten as to be thrown into fevers  There is a small long shining fly in these parts very troublesome to the housewife by getting into the chimnies and laying it's eggs in the bacon while it is drying these eggs produce maggots called  jumpers  which harbouring in the gammons and best parts of the hogs eat down to the bone and make great waste This fly I suspect to be a variety of the  musca putris  of  Linnaeus  it is to be seen in the summer in farmkitchens on the baconracks and about the mantlepieces and on the ceilings  The insect that infests turnips and many crops in the garden destroying often whole fields while in their seedling leaves is an animal that wants to be better known The country people here call it the  turnipfly  and  blackdolphin  but I know it to be one of the  coleoptera  the  "  chrysomela oleracea saltatoria femoribus posticis crassissimis  "  In very hot summers they abound to an amazing degree and as you walk in a field or in a garden make a pattering like rain by jumping on the leaves of the turnips or cabbages  There is an  Oestrus  known in these parts to every ploughboy which because it is omitted by  Linnaeus  is also passed over by late writers and that is the  curvicauda  of old  Moufet  mentioned  by  Derham  in his Physicotheology p an insect worthy of remark for depositing it's eggs as it flies in so dextrous a manner on the single hairs of the legs and flanks of grasshorses But then  Derham  is mistaken when he advances that this  Oestrus  is the parent of that wonderful startailed maggot which he mentions afterwards for more modern entomologists have discovered that singular production to be derived from the egg or the  musca chamaeleon  see  Geoffroy  t f  A full history of noxious insects hurtful in the field garden and house suggesting all the known and likely means of destroying them would be allowed by the public to be a most useful and important work What knowledge there is of this sort lies scattered and wants to be collected great improvements would soon follow of course A knowledge of the properties oeconomy propagation and in short of the life and conversation of these animals is a necessary step to lead us to some method of preventing their depredations  As far as I am a judge nothing would recommend entomology more than some neat plates that should well express the  generic distinctions  of insects according to  Linnaeus  for I am well assured that many people would study insects could they set out with a more adequate notion of those distinctions than can be conveyed at first by words alone  LETTER XXXV TO THE SAME  SELBORNE    DEAR SIR  HAPPENING to make a visit to my neighbour's peacocks I could not help observing that the trains of those magnificent birds appear by no means to be their tails those long feathers growing not from their  uropygium  but all up their backs A range of short brown stiff feathers about six inches long fixed in the  uropygium  is the real tail and serves as the  fulcrum  to prop the train which is long and topheavy when set an end When the train is up nothing appears of the bird before but it's head and neck but this would not be the case were those long feathers fixed only in the rump as may be seen by the turkeycock when in a strutting attitude By a strong muscular vibration these birds can make the shafts of their long feathers clatter like the swords of a sworddancer they then trample very quick with their feet and run backwards towards the females  I should tell you that I have got an uncommon  calculus aegogropila  taken out of the stomach of a fat ox it is perfectly round and about the size of a large  Seville  orange such are I think usually flat  LETTER XXXVI TO THE SAME  Sept  DEAR SIR  THE summer through I have seen but two of that large species of bat which I call  vespertilio altivolans  from it's manner of feeding high in the air I procured one of them and found it to be a male and made no doubt as they accompanied together that the other was a female but happening in an evening or two to procure the other likewise I was somewhat disappointed when it appeared to be also of the same sex This circumstance and the great scarcity of this sort at least in these parts occasions some suspicions in my mind whether it is really a species or whether it may not be the male part of the more known species one of which may supply many females as is known to be the case in sheep and some other quadrupeds But this doubt can only be cleared by a farther examination and some attention to the sex of more specimens all that I know at present is that my two were amply furnished with the parts of generation much resembling those of a boar  In the extent of their wings they measured fourteen inches and an half and four inches and an half from the nose to the tip of the tail their heads were large their nostrils bilobated their shoulders broad and muscular and their whole bodies fleshy and plump Nothing could be more sleek and soft than their fur which was of a bright chesnut colour their maws were full of  food but so macerated that the quality could not be distinguished their livers kidnies and hearts were large and their bowels covered with fat They weighed each when entire full one ounce and one drachm Within the ear there was somewhat of a peculiar structure that I did not understand perfectly but refer it to the observation of the curious anatomist These creatures sent forth a very rancid and offensive smell  LETTER XXXVII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE    DEAR SIR  ON the twelfth of  July  I had a fair opportunity of contemplating the motions of the  caprimulgus  or fernowl as it was playing round a large oak that swarmed with  scarabaei solstitiales  or fernchafers The powers of it's wing were wonderful exceeding if possible the various evolutions and quick turns of the swallow genus But the circumstance that pleased me most was that I saw it distinctly more than once put out it's short leg while on the wing and by a bend of the head deliver somewhat into it's mouth If it takes any part of it's prey with it's foot as I have now the greatest reason to suppose it does these chafers I no longer wonder at the use of it's middle toe which is curiously furnished with a serrated claw  Swallows and martins the bulk of them I mean have forsaken us sooner this year than usual for on  September  the twentysecond they rendezvoused in a neighbour's walnuttree where it seemed probable they had taken up their lodging for the night At the dawn of the day which was foggy they arose all together in infinite numbers occasioning such a rushing from the strokes of their wings against the hazy air as might be heard to a considerable distance since that no flock has appeared only a few stragglers  Some swifts staid late till the twentysecond of  August  a rare instance for they usually withdraw within the first week  See letter liii to Mr  Barrington    On  September  the twentyfourth three or four ringousels appeared in my fields for the first time this season how punctual are these visitors in their autumnal and spring migrations  LETTER XXXVIII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  March  DEAR SIR  BY my journal for last autumn it appears that the housemartins bred very late and staid very late in these parts for on the first of  October  I saw young martins in their nest nearly fledged and again on the twentyfirst of  October  we had at the next house a nest full of young martins just ready to fly and the old ones were hawking for insects with great alertness The next  morning the brood forsook their nest and were flying round the village From this day I never saw one of the swallow kind till  November  the third when twenty or perhaps thirty housemartins were playing all day long by the side of the hanging wood and over my fields Did these small weak birds some of which were nestlings twelve days ago shift their quarters at this late season of the year to the other side of the northern tropic Or rather is it not more probable that the next church ruin chalkcliff steep covert or perhaps sandbank lake or pool as a more northern naturalist would say may become their  hybernaculum  and afford them a ready and obvious retreat  We now begin to expect our vernal migration of ringousels every week Persons worthy of credit assure me that ringousels were seen at  Christmas  in the forest of  Bere  on the southern verge of this county Hence we may conclude that their migrations are only internal and not extended to the continent southward if they do at first come at all from the northern parts of this island only and not from the north of  Europe  Come from whence they will it is plain from the fearless disregard that they shew for men or guns that they have been little accustomed to places of much resort Navigators mention that in the  Isle of Ascension  and other such desolate districts birds are so little acquainted with the human form that they settle on men's shoulders and have no more dread of a sailor than they would have of a goat that was grazing A young man at  Lewes  in  Sussex  assured me that about seven years ago ringousels abounded so about that town in the autumn that he killed sixteen himself in one afternoon he added further that some had appeared since in every autumn but he could not find that any had been observed before the season in which he shot so many I myself have found these birds in  little parties in the autumn cantoned all along the  Sussex  downs wherever there were shrubs and bushes from  Chichester  to  Lewes  particularly in the autumn of  I am c  LETTER XXXIX TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Nov  DEAR SIR  As you desire me to send you such observations as may occur I take the liberty of making the following remarks that you may according as you think me right or wrong admit or reject what I here advance in your intended new edition of the  British Zoology  The osprey  British Zoology vol p  was shot about a year ago at  Frinshampond  a great lake at about six miles from hence while it was sitting on the handle of a plough and devouring a fish it used to precipitate itself into the water and so take it's prey by surprise  A great ashcoloured  p  butcherbird was shot last winter in  Tistedpark  and a red backed butcherbird at  Selborne  they are  rarae aves  in this county  Crows  p  go in pairs the whole year round  Cornish  choughs  p  abound and breed on  Beachyhead  and on all the cliffs of the  Sussex  coast  The common wildpigeon  p  or stockdove is a bird of passage in the south of  England  seldom appearing till towards the end of  November  is usually the latest winterbird of passage Before our beechen woods were so much destroyed we had myriads of them reaching in strings for a mile together as they went out in a morning to feed They leave us early in spring where do they breed  The people of  Hampshire  and  Sussex  call the misselbird  p  the stormcock because it sings early in the spring in blowing showery weather it's song often commences with the year with us it builds much in orchards  A gentleman assures me he has taken the nests of ringousels  p  on  Dartmoor  they build in banks on the sides of streams  Titlarks  Vol p  not only sing sweetly as they sit on trees but also as they play and toy about on the wing and particularly while they are descending and sometimes as they stand on the ground  Adanson  's  p  testimony seems to me to be a very poor evidence that  European  swallows migrate during our winter to  Senegal  he does not talk at all like an ornithologist and probably saw only the swallows of that country which I know build within Governor  O'Hara  's hall against the roof Had he known  European  swallows would he not have mentioned the species  The  houseswallow  washes by dropping into the water as it flies this  species  appears commonly about a week before the  housemartin  and about ten or twelve days before the  swift  In there were young housemartins    in their nest till  October  the twentythird  The  swift    appears about  ten  or  twelve  days later than the  houseswallow viz  about the twentyfourth or twentysixth of  April  Whinchats  and  stonechatters    stay with us the whole year  Some wheatears    continue with us the winter through  Wagtails all sorts remain with us all the winter  Bulfinches    when fed on hempseed often become wholly black  We have vast flocks of  female  chaffinches    all the winter with hardly any males among them  When you say that in breedingtime the cocksnipes    make a bleating noise and I a drumming perhaps I should have rather said an humming I suspect we mean the same thing However while they are playing about on the wing they certainly make a loud piping with their mouths but whether that bleating or humming is ventriloquous or proceeds from the motion of their wings I cannot say but this I know that when this noise happens the bird is always descending and his wings are violently agitated  Soon after the lapwings    have done breeding they congregate and leaving the moors and marshes betake themselves to downs and sheepwalks  Two years ago    last spring the little auk was found alive and unhurt but fluttering and unable to rise in a lane a few miles from  Alresford  where there is a great lake it was kept awhile but died  I saw young teals    taken alive in the ponds of  Wolmerforest  in the beginning of  July  last along with slappers or young wildducks  Speaking of the  swift  p  that page says  "  it's drink the dew  "  whereas it should be  "it drinks on the wing"  for all the swallow kind sip their water as they sweep over the face of pools or rivers like  Virgil  's bees they drink flying  "  flumina summa libant  "  In this method of drinking perhaps this genus may be peculiar  Of the sedgebird  p  be pleased to say it sings most part of the night it's notes are hurrying but not unpleasing and imitative of several birds as the sparrow swallow skylark When it happens to be silent in the night by throwing a stone or clod into the bushes where it sits you immediately set it a singing or in other words though it slumbers sometimes yet as soon as it is awakened it reassumes it's song  LETTER XL TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Sept  DEAR SIR  BEFORE your letter arrived and of my own accord I had been remarking and comparing the tails of the male and female swallow and this ere any young broods appeared so that there was no danger of confounding the dams with their  pulli  and besides as they were then always in pairs and busied in the employ of nidification there could be no room for mistaking the sexes nor the individuals of different chimnies the one for the other From all my observations it constantly appeared that each sex  has the long feathers in it's tail that give it that forked shape with this difference that they are longer in the tail of the male than in that of the female  Nightingales when their young first come abroad and are helpless make a plaintive and a jarring noise and also a snapping or cracking pursuing people along the hedges as they walk these last sounds seem intended for menace and defiance  The grasshopperlark chirps all night in the height of summer  Swans turn white the second year and breed the third  Weasels prey on moles as appears by their being sometimes caught in moletraps  Sparrowhawks sometimes breed in old crows' nests and the kestril in churches and ruins  There are supposed to be two sorts of eels in the island of  Ely  The threads sometimes discovered in eels are perhaps their young the generation of eels is very dark and mysterious  Henharriers breed on the ground and seem never to settle on trees  When redstarts shake their tails they move them horizontally as dogs do when they fawn the tail of a wagtail when in motion bobs up and down like that of a jaded horse  Hedgesparrows have a remarkable flirt with their wings in breedingtime as soon as frosty mornings come they make a very piping plaintive noise  Many birds which become silent about  Midsummer  reassume their notes again in  September  as the thrush blackbird woodlark willowwren c hence  August  is by much the most mute month the spring summer and autumn through Are birds induced to sing again because the temperament of autumn resembles that of spring  Linnaeus  ranges plants geographically palms inhabit the tropics grasses the temperate zones and mosses and lichens the polar circles no doubt animals may be classed in the same manner with propriety  Housesparrows build under eaves in the spring as the weather becomes hotter they get out for coolness and nest in plumtrees and appletrees These birds have been known sometimes to build in rooks' nests and sometimes in the forks of boughs under rooks' nests  As my neighbour was housing a rick he observed that his dogs devoured all the little red mice that they could catch but rejected the common mice and that his cats ate the common mice refusing the red  Redbreasts sing all through the spring summer and autumn The reason that they are called autumn songsters is because in the two first seasons their voices are drowned and lost in the general chorus in the latter their song becomes distinguishable Many songsters of the autumn seem to be the young cock redbreasts of that year notwithstanding the prejudices in their favour they do much mischief in gardens to the summerfruits  They eat also the berries of the ivy the honeysuckle and the  euonymus europaeus  or spindletree    The titmouse which early in  February  begins to make two quaint notes like the whetting of a saw is the marsh titmouse the great titmouse sings with three cheerful joyous notes and begins about the same time  Wrens sing all the winter through frost excepted  Housemartins came remarkably late this year both in  Hampshire  and  Devonshire  is this circumstance for or against either hiding or migration  Most birds drink sipping at intervals but pigeons take a long continued draught like quadrupeds  Notwithstanding what I have said in a former letter no grey crows were ever known to breed on  Dartmoor  it was my mistake  The appearance and flying of the  scarabaeus solstitialis  or fernchafer commence with the month of  July  and cease about the end of it These scarabs are the constant food of  caprimulgi  or fern owls through that period They abound on the chalky downs and in some sandy districts but not in the clays  In the garden of the  Blackbear  inn in the town of  Reading  is a stream or canal running under the stables and out into the fields on the other side of the road in this water are many carps which lie rolling about in sight being fed by travellers who amuse themselves by tossing them bread but as soon as the weather grows at all severe these fishes are no longer seen because they retire under the stables where they remain till the return of spring Do they lie in a torpid state if they do not how are they supported  The note of the whitethroat which is continually repeated and often attended with odd gesticulations on the wing is harsh and displeasing These birds seem of a pugnacious disposition for they sing with an erected crest and attitudes of rivalry and defiance are shy and wild in breedingtime avoiding neighbourhoods and haunting lonely lanes and commons nay even the very tops of the  Sussexdowns  where there are bushes and covert but in  July  and  August  they bring their broods into gardens and orchards and make great havock among the summerfruits  The blackcap has in common a full sweet deep loud and wild pipe yet that strain is of short continuance and his motions are desultory but when that bird sits calmly and engages in song  in earnest he pours forth very sweet but inward melody and expresses great variety of soft and gentle modulations superior perhaps to those of any of our warblers the nightingale excepted  Blackcaps mostly haunt orchards and gardens while they warble their throats are wonderfully distended  The song of the redstart is superior though somewhat like that of the whitethroat some birds have a few more notes than others Sitting very placidly on the top of a tall tree in a village the cock sings from morning to night he affects neighbourhoods and avoids solitude and loves to build in orchards and about houses with us he perches on the vane of a tall maypole  The flycatcher is of all our summer birds the most mute and the most familiar it also appears the last of any It builds in a vine or a sweetbriar against the wall of an house or in the hole of a wall or on the end of a beam or plate and often close to the post of a door where people are going in and out all day long This bird does not make the least pretension to song but uses a little inward wailing note when it thinks it's young in danger from cats or other annoyances it breeds but once and retires early  Selborne  parish alone can and has exhibited at times more than half the birds that are ever seen in all  Sweden  the former has produced more than one hundred and twenty species the latter only two hundred and twentyone Let me add also that it has shewn near half the species that were ever known in  GreatBritian  Sweden    GreatBritian  species    On a retrospect I observe that my long letter carries with it a quaint and magisterial air and is very sententious but when I recollect that you requested stricture and anecdote I hope you will pardon the didactic manner for the sake of the information it may happen to contain  LETTER XLI TO THE SAME  IT is matter of curious inquiry to trace out how those species of softbilled birds that continue with us the winter through subsist during the dead months The imbecility of birds seems not to be the only reason why they shun the rigour of our winters for the robust  wryneck  so much resembling the hardy race of  woodpeckers  migrates while the feeble little  goldencrowned wren  that shadow of a bird braves our severest frosts without availing himself of houses or villages to which most of our winterbirds crowd in distressful seasons while this keeps aloof in fields and woods but perhaps this may be the reason why they may often perish and why they are almost as rare as any bird we know  I have no reason to doubt but that the softbilled birds which winter with us subsist chiefly on insects in their  aurelia  state All the species of  wagtails  in severe weather haunt shallow streams near their springheads where they never freeze and by wading pick out the aurelias of the genus of  See  Derham  's Physicotheology p  Phryganeae  c  Hedgesparrows  frequent sinks and gutters in hard weather where they pick up crumbs and other sweepings and in mild weather they procure worms which are stirring every month in the year as any one may see that will only be at the trouble of taking a candle to a grassplot on any mild winter's night Redbreasts and wrens in the winter haunt outhouses stables and barns  where they find spiders and flies that have laid themselves up during the cold season But the grand support of the softbilled birds in winter is that infinite profusion of  aureliae  of the  lepidoptera ordo  which is fastened to the twigs of trees and their trunks to the pales and walls of gardens and buildings and is found in every cranny and cleft of rock or rubbish and even in the ground itself  Every species of titmouse winters with us they have what I call a kind of intermediate bill between the hard and the soft between the  Linnaean  genera of  fringilla  and  motacilla  One species alone spends it's whole time in the woods and fields never retreating for succour in the severest seasons to houses and neighbourhoods and that is the delicate longtailed titmouse which is almost as minute as the goldencrowned wren but the blue titmouse or nun  parus caeruleus  the colemouse  parus ater  the great blackheaded titmouse  fringillago  and the marsh titmouse  parus palustris  all resort at times to buildings and in hard weather particularly The great titmouse driven by stress of weather much frequents houses and in deep snows I have seen this bird while it hung with it's back downwards to my no small delight and admiration draw straws lengthwise from out the eaves of thatched houses in order to pull out the flies that were concealed between them and that in such numbers that they quite defaced the thatch and gave it a ragged appearance  The blue  titmouse  or  nun  is a great frequenter of houses and a general devourer Besides insects it is very fond of flesh for it frequently picks bones on dunghills it is a vast admirer of suet and haunts butchers' shops When a boy I have known twenty in a morning caught with snap mousetraps baited with tallow or suet It will also pick holes in apples left on the ground and  be well entertained with the seeds on the head of a sunflower The blue marsh and great titmice will in very severe weather carry away barley and oat straws from the sides of ricks  How the  wheatear  and  whinchat  support themselves in winter cannot be so easily ascertained since they spend their time on wild heaths and warrens the former especially where there are stone quarries most probably it is that their maintenance arises from the  aureliae  of the  lepidoptera ordo  which furnish them with a plentiful table in the wilderness  I am c  LETTER XLII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  March  DEAR SIR  SOME future  faunist  a man of fortune will I hope extend his visits to the kingdom of  Ireland  a new field and a country little known to the naturalist He will not it is to be wished undertake that tour unaccompanied by a botanist because the mountains have scarcely been sufficiently examined and the southerly counties of so mild an island may possibly afford some plants little to be expected within the  British  dominions A person of a thinking turn of mind will draw many just remarks from the modern improvements of that country both in arts and agriculture where premiums obtained long before they were heard of with us The manners of the wild natives their superstitions their prejudices  their sordid way of life will extort from him many useful reflections He should also take with him an able draughtsman for he must by no means pass over the noble castles and seats the extensive and picturesque lakes and waterfalls and the lofty stupendous mountains so little known and so engaging to the imagination when described and exhibited in a lively manner such a work would be well received  As I have seen no modern map of  Scotland  I cannot pretend to say how accurate or particular any such may be but this I know that the best old maps of that kingdom are very defective  The great obvious defect that I have remarked in all maps of  Scotland  that have fallen in my way is a want of a  coloured line  or  stroke  that shall exactly define the just limits of that district called  The Highlands  Moreover all the great avenues to that mountainous and romantic country want to be well distinguished The military roads formed by general  Wade  are so great and Romanlike an undertaking that they well merit attention My old map  Moll  's Map takes notice of  Fort William  but could not mention the other forts that have been erected long since therefore a good representation of the chain of forts should not be omitted  The celebrated zigzag up the  Coryarich  must not be passed over  Moll  takes notice of  Hamilton  and  Drumlanrig  and such capital houses but a new survey no doubt should represent every seat and castle remarkable for any great event or celebrated for it's paintings c Lord  Breadalbane  's seat and beautiful  policy  are too curious and extraordinary to be omitted  The seat of the Earl of  Eglintoun  near  Glasgow  is worthy of notice The pineplantations of that nobleman are very grand and extensive indeed  I am c  LETTER XLIII TO THE SAME  A PAIR of  honeybuzzards buteo apivorus five vespivorus Raii  built them a large shallow nest composed of twigs and lined with dead beechen leaves upon a tall slender beech near the middle of  Selbornehanger  in the summer of In the middle of the month of  June  a bold boy climbed this tree though standing on so steep and dizzy a situation and brought down an egg the only one in the nest which had been sat on for some time and contained the embrio of a young bird The egg was smaller and not so round as those of the common buzzard was dotted at each end with small red spots and surrounded in the middle with a broad bloody zone  The henbird was shot and answered exactly to Mr  Ray  's description of that species had a black  cere  short thick legs and a long tail When on the wing this species may be easily distinguished from the  common buzzard  by it's hawklike appearance small head wings not so blunt and longer tail This specimen contained in it's craw some limbs of frogs and many grey snails without shells The  irides  of the eyes of this bird were of a beautiful bright yellow colour  About the tenth of  July  in the same summer a pair of  sparrowhawks  bred in an old crow's nest on a low beech in the same hanger and as their brood which was numerous began to grow  up became so daring and ravenous that they were a terror to all the dames in the village that had chickens or ducklings under their care A boy climbed the tree and found the young so fledged that they all escaped from him but discovered that a good house had been kept the larder was wellstored with provisions for he brought down a young blackbird jay and housemartin all clean picked and some half devoured The old birds had been observed to make sad havock for some days among the newflown swallows and martins which being but lately out of their nests had not acquired those powers and command of wing that enable them when more mature to set such enemies at defiance  LETTER XLIV TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Nov  DEAR SIR  EVERY incident that occasions a renewal of our correspondence will ever be pleasing and agreeable to me  As to the wild  woodpigeon  the  oenas  or  vinago  of  Ray  I am much of your mind and see no reason for making it the origin of the common  housedove  but suppose those that have advanced that opinion may have been misled by another appellation often given to the  oenas  which is that of  stockdove  Unless the stockdove in the winter varies greatly in manners from itself in summer no species seems more unlikely to be domesticated and to make an  housedove  We very rarely see the latter settle on trees at all nor does it ever haunt the woods but the former as long as it stays with us from  November  perhaps to  February  lives the same wild life with the  ringdove palumbus torquatus  frequents coppices and groves supports itself chiefly by mast and delights to roost in the tallest beeches Could it be known in what manner stockdoves build the doubt would be settled with me at once provided they construct their nests on trees like the  ringdove  as I much suspect they do  You received you say last spring a  stockdove  from  Sussex  and are informed that they sometimes breed in that country But why did not your correspondent determine the place of it's nidification whether on rocks cliffs or trees If he was not an adroit ornithologist I should doubt the fact because people with us perpetually confound the  stockdove  with the  ringdove  For my own part I readily concur with you in supposing that housedoves are derived from the  small blue rockpigeon  for many reasons In the first place the wild stockdove is manifestly larger than the common housedove against the usual rule of domestication which generally enlarges the breed Again those two remarkable  black spots  on the remiges of each wing of the stockdove which are so characteristic of the species would not one should think be totally lost by it's being reclaimed but would often break out among its descendants But what is worth an hundred arguments is the instance you give in Sir  Roger Moslyn  's housedoves in  Caernarvonshire  which though tempted by plenty of food and gentle treatment can never be prevailed on to  inhabit their cote for any time but as soon as they begin to breed betake themselves to the fastnesses of  Ormshead  and deposit their young in safety amidst the inaccessible caverns and precipices of that stupendous promontory  "Naturam expellas furcâ tamen usque recurret"  I have consulted a sportsman now in his seventyeighth year who tells me that fifty or sixty years back when the beechen woods were much more extensive than at present the number of woodpigeons was astonishing that he has often killed near twenty in a day and that with a long wildfowl piece he has shot seven or eight at a time on the wing as they came wheeling over his head he moreover adds which I was not aware of that often there were among them little parties of small  blue doves  which he calls  rockiers  The food of these numberless emigrants was beechmast and some acorns and particularly barley which they collected in the stubbles But of late years since the vast increase of turnips that vegetable has furnished a great part of their support in hard weather and the holes they pick in these roots greatly damage the crop From this food their flesh has contracted a rancidness which occasions them to be rejected by nicer judges of eating who thought them before a delicate dish They were shot not only as they were feeding in the fields and especially in snowy weather but also at the close of the evening by men who lay in ambush among the woods and groves to kill them as they came in to roost  Some old sportsmen say that the main part of these flocks used to withdraw as soon as the heavy  Christmas  frosts were over  These are the principal circumstances relating to this  wonderful  internal  migration which with us takes place towards the end of  November  and ceases early in the spring Last winter we had in  Selborne  high wood about an hundred of these doves but in former times the flocks were so vast not only with us but all the district round that on mornings and evenings they traversed the air like rooks in strings reaching for a mile together When they thus rendezvoused here by thousands if they happened to be suddenly roused from their roosttrees on an evening  "Their rising all at once was like the sound  "Of thunder heard remote"  It will by no means be foreign to the present purpose to add that I had a relation in this neighbourhood who made it a practice for a time whenever he could procure the eggs of a  ringdove  to place them under a pair of doves that were sitting in his own pigeonhouse hoping thereby if he could bring about a coalition to enlarge his breed and teach his own doves to beat out into the woods and to support themselves by mast the plan was plausible but something always interrupted the success for though the birds were usually hatched and sometimes grew to half their size yet none ever arrived at maturity I myself have seen these foundlings in their nest displaying a strange ferocity of nature so as scarcely to bear to be looked at and snapping with their bills by way of menace In short they always died perhaps for want of proper sustenance but the owner thought that by their fierce and wild demeanour they frighted their fostermothers and so were starved  Virgil  as a familiar occurrence by way of simile describes a dove haunting the cavern of a rock in such engaging numbers that I cannot refrain from quoting the passage and  John Dryden  has rendered it so happily in our language that without farther excuse I shall add his translation also  "Qualis speluncâ subitò commota Columba  "Cui domus et dulces latebroso in pumice nidi  "Fertur in arva volans plausumque exterrita pennis  "Dat tecto ingentemmox aere lapsa quieto  "Radit iter liquidum celeres neque commovet alas"  "As when a dove her rocky hold forsakes  "Rous'd in a fright her sounding wings she shakes  "The cavern rings with clatteringout she flies  "And leaves her callow care and cleaves the skies  "At first she fluttersbut at length she springs  "To smoother flight and shoots upon her wings"  I am c  LETTER I TO THE HONOURABLE DAINES BARRINGTON  SELBORNE  June  DEAR SIR  WHEN I was in town last month I partly engaged that I would sometime do myself the honour to write to you on the subject of natural

SELBORNE  Nov  DEAR SIR  WHEN I did myself the honour to write to you about the end of last  June  on the subject of natural history I sent you a list of the summerbirds of passage which I have observed in this neighbourhood and also a list of the winterbirds of passage I mentioned besides those softbilled birds that stay with us the winter through in the south of  England  and those that are remarkable for singing in the night  According to my proposal I shall now proceed to such birds singing birds strictly so called as continue in full song till after  Midsummer  and shall range

bulk I mean in this island where they are much pursued and annoyed but in  Ascension Island  and many other desolate places mariners have found fowls so unacquainted with an human figure that they would stand still to be taken as is the case with boobies c As an example of what is advanced I remark that the  goldencrested wren  the smallest  British  bird will stand unconcerned till you come within three or four yards of it while the  bustard otis  the largest  British  land fowl does not care to admit a person within so many furlongs  I am c  LETTER III TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Jan  DEAR SIR  IT was no small matter of satisfaction to me to find that you were not displeased with my little  methodus  of birds If there was any merit in the sketch it must be owing to it's punctuality For many months I carried a list in my pocket of the birds that were to be remarked and as I rode or walked about my business I noted each day the continuance or omission of each bird's song so that I am as sure of the certainty of my facts as a man can be of any transaction whatsoever  I shall now proceed to answer the several queries which you put in your two obliging letters in the best manner that I am able Perhaps  Eastwick  and it's environs where you heard so very few birds is not a woodland country and therefore not stocked with such songsters If you will cast your eye on my last letter you will find that many species continued to warble after the beginning of  July  The titlark and yellowhammer breed late the latter very late and therefore it is no wonder that they protract their song for I lay it down as a maxim in ornithology that as long as there is any incubation going on there is music As to the redbreast and wren it is well known to the most incurious observer that they whistle the year round hard frost excepted especially the latter  It was not in my power to procure you a blackcap or a less reedsparrow or sedgebird alive As the first is undoubtedly and the last as far as I can yet see a summer bird of passage they would require more nice and curious management in a cage than I should be able to give them they are both distinguished songsters The note of the former has such a wild sweetness that it always brings to my mind those lines in a song in "  As You Like It  "  "And tune his merry note  "Unto the  wild  bird's throat"  SHAKESPEARE  The latter has a surprising variety of notes resembling the song of several other birds but then it has also an hurrying manner not at all to it's advantage it is notwithstanding a delicate polyglot  It is new to me that titlarks in cages sing in the night perhaps only caged birds do so I once knew a tame redbreast in a cage that always sang as long as candles were in the room but in their wild state no one supposes they sing in the night  I should be almost ready to doubt the fact that there are to be seen much fewer birds in  July  than in any former month notwithstanding so many young are hatched daily Sure I am that it is far otherwise with respect to the  swallow tribe  which increases prodigiously as the summer advances and I saw at the time mentioned many hundreds of young wagtails on the banks of the  Cherwell  which almost covered the meadows If the matter appears as you say in the other species may it not be owing to the dams being engaged in incubation while the young are concealed by the leaves  Many times have I had the curiosity to open the stomachs of  woodcocks  and  snipes  but nothing ever occurred that helped to explain to me what their subsistence might be all that I could ever find was a soft mucus among which lay many pellucid small gravels  I am c  LETTER IV TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Feb  DEAR SIR  YOUR observation that  "the  cuckoo  does not deposit it's egg indiscriminately in the nest of the first bird that comes in it's way but probably looks out a nurse in some degree congenerous with whom to intrust it's young"  is perfectly new to me and struck me so forcibly that I naturally fell into a train of thought that led me to consider whether the fact was so and what reason there was for it When I came to recollect and inquire I could not find that any cuckoo had ever been seen in these parts except in the nest of the  wagtail  the  hedgesparrow  the  titlark  the  whitethroat  and the  redbreast  all softbilled insectivorous birds The excellent Mr  Willughby  mentions the nest of the  palumbus ringdove  and of the  fringilla chaffinch  birds that subsist on acorns and grains and such hard food but then he does not mention them as of his own knowledge but says afterwards  that he saw himself a  wagtail  feeding a cuckoo It appears hardly possible that a softbilled bird should subsist on the same food with the hardbilled for the former have thin membranaceous stomachs suited to their soft food while the latter the granivorous tribe have strong muscular gizzards which like mills grind by the help of small gravels and pebbles what is swallowed This proceeding of the cuckoo of dropping it's eggs as it were by chance is such a monstrous outrage on maternal affection one of the first great dictates of nature and such a violence on instinct that had it only been related of a bird in the  Brasils  or  Peru  it would never have merited our belief But yet should it farther appear that this simple bird when divested of that natural  that seems to raise the kind in general above themselves and inspire them with extraordinary degrees of cunning and address may be still endued with a more enlarged faculty of discerning what species are suitable and congenerous nursingmothers for it's disregarded eggs and young and may deposit them only under  their  care this would be adding wonder to wonder and instancing in a fresh manner that the methods of Providence are not subjected to any mode or rule but astonish us in new lights and in various and changeable appearances  What was said by a very ancient and sublime writer concerning the defect of natural affection in the ostrich may be well applied to the bird we are talking of  "  She is hardened against her young ones as though they were not her's  "  "  Because God hath deprived her of wisdom neither hath he imparted to her understanding  Job xxxix  "  Query  Does each female cuckoo lay but one egg in a season or does she drop several in different nests according as opportunity offers  I am c  LETTER V TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  April  DEAR SIR  I HEARD many birds of several species sing last year after  Midsummer  enough to prove that the summer solstice is not the period that puts a stop to the music of the woods The yellowhammer no doubt persists with more steadiness than any other but the woodlark the wren the redbreast the swallow the whitethroat the goldfinch the common linnet are all undoubted instances of the truth of what I advanced  If this severe season does not interrupt the regularity of the summer migrations the blackcap will be here in two or three days I wish it was in my power to procure you one of those songsters but I am no birdcatcher and so little used to birds in a cage that I fear if I had one it would soon die for want of skill in feeding  Was your reedsparrow which you kept in a cage the thickbilled reedsparrow of the Zoology p or was it the less reedsparrow of  Ray  the  sedgebird  of Mr  Pennant  's last publication p  As to the matter of longbilled birds growing fatter in moderate frosts I have no doubt within myself what should be the reason The thriving at those times appears to me to arise altogether from the gentle check which the cold throws upon insensible perspiration The case is just the same with blackbirds c and farmers and warreners observe the first that their hogs fat more kindly at such times and the latter that their rabbits are never in such good case as in a gentle frost But when frosts are severe and of long continuance the case is soon altered for then a want of food soon overbalances the repletion occasioned by a checked perspiration I have observed moreover that some human constitutions are more inclined to plumpness in winter than in summer  When birds come to suffer by severe frost I find that the first that fail and die are the redwingfieldfares and then the songthrushes  You wonder with good reason that the hedgesparrows c can be induced at all to sit on the egg of the cuckoo without being scandalized at the vast disproportioned size of the supposititious egg but the brute creation I suppose have very little idea of size colour or number For the common hen I know when the fury of incubation is on her will sit on a single shapeless stone instead of a nest full of eggs that have been withdrawn and moreover a henturkey in the same circumstances would sit on in the empty nest till she perished with hunger  I think the matter might easily be determined whether a cuckoo lays one or two eggs or more in a season by opening a female  during the layingtime If more than one was come down out of the ovary and advanced to a good size doubtless then she would that spring lay more than one  I will endeavour to get a hen and to examine  Your supposition that there may be some natural obstruction in singing birds while they are mute and that when this is removed the song recommences is new and bold I wish you could discover some good grounds for this suspicion  I was glad you were pleased with my specimen of the  caprimulgus  or fernowl you were I find acquainted with the bird before  When we meet I shall be glad to have some conversation with you concerning the proposal you make of my drawing up an account of the animals in this neighbourhood Your partiality towards my small abilities persuades you I fear that I am able to do more than is in my power for it is no small undertaking for a man unsupported and alone to begin a natural history from his own autopsia Though there is endless room for observation in the field of nature which is boundless yet investigation where a man endeavours to be sure of his facts can make but slow progress and all that one could collect in many years would go into a very narrow compass  Some extracts from your ingenious  "Investigations of the difference between the present temperature of the air in Italy"  c have fallen in my way and gave me great satisfaction they have removed the objections that always arose in my mind whenever I came to the passages which you quote Surely the judicious  Virgil  when writing a didactic poem for the region of  Italy  could never think of describing freezing rivers unless such severity of weather pretty frequently occurred  PS Swallows appear amidst snows and frost  LETTER VI TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  May  DEAR SIR  THE severity and turbulence of last month so interrupted the regular process of summer migration that some of the birds do but just begin to shew themselves and others are apparently thinner than usual as the whitethroat the blackcap the redstart the flycatcher I well remember that after the very severe spring in the year summer birds of passage were very scarce They come probably hither with a southeast wind or when it blows between those points but in that unfavourable year the winds blowed the whole spring and summer through from the opposite quarters And yet amidst all these disadvantages two swallows as I mentioned in my last appeared this year as early as the eleventh of  April  amidst frost and snow but they withdrew again for a time  I am not pleased to find that some people seem so little satisfied with  Scopoli  's new publication  This work he calls his  Annus Primus Historico Naturalis  there is room to expect great things from the hands of that man who is a good naturalist and one would think that an history of the birds of so distant and southern a region as  Carniola  would be new and interesting I could wish to see that work and hope to get it sent down Dr  Scopoli  is physician to the wretches that work in the quicksilver mines of that district  When you talked of keeping a reedsparrow and giving it seeds I could not help wondering because the reedsparrow which I mentioned to you  passer arundinaceus minor Raii  is a softbilled bird and most probably migrates hence before winter  whereas the bird you kept  passer torquatus Raii  abides all the year and is a thickbilled bird I question whether the latter be much of a songster but in this matter I want to be better informed The former has a variety of hurrying notes and sings all night Some part of the song of the former I suspect is attributed to the latter We have plenty of the softbilled sort which Mr  Pennant  had entirely left out of his  British Zoology  till I reminded him of his omission See  British Zoology  last published p  See letter xxv to Mr  Pennant    I have somewhat to advance on the different manners in which different birds fly and walk but as this is a subject that I have not enough considered and is of such a nature as not to be contained in a small space I shall say nothing further about it at present  See letter xlii to Mr  Barrington    No doubt the reason why the sex of birds in their first plumage is so difficult to be distinguished is as you say  "because they are not to pair and discharge their parental functions till the ensuing spring"  As colours seem to be the chief external sexual distinction in many birds these colours do not take place till sexual attachments begin to obtain And the case is the same in quadrupeds among whom in their younger days the sexes differ but little but as they advance to maturity horns and shaggy manes beards and brawny necks c c strongly discriminate the male from the female We may instance still farther in our own species where a beard and stronger features are usually characteristic of the male sex but this sexual diversity does not take place in earlier life for a beautiful youth shall be so like a beautiful girl that the difference shall not be discernible  "Quem si puellarum insereres choro  "Mirè sagaces falleret hospites  "Discrimen obscurum solutis  "Crinibus ambiguoque vultu"  HOR  LETTER VII TO THE SAME  RINGMER near LEWES  Oct  DEAR SIR  I AM glad to hear that  Kuckalm  is to furnish you with the birds of  Jamaica  a sight of the  hirundines  of that hot and distant island would be a great entertainment to me  The  Anni of Scopoli  are now in my possession and I have read the  Annus Primus  with satisfaction for though some parts of this work are exceptionable and he may advance some mistaken observations yet the ornithology of so distant a country as  Carniola  is very curious Men that undertake only one district are much more likely to advance natural knowledge than those that grasp at more than they can possibly be acquainted with every kingdom every province should have it's own  monographer  The reason perhaps why he mentions nothing of  Ray  's Ornithology may be the extreme poverty and distance of his country into which the works of our great naturalist may have never yet found their way You have doubts I know whether this Ornithology is genuine and really the work of  Scopoli  as to myself I think I discover strong tokens of authenticity the style corresponds with that of his  Entomology  and his characters of his Ordines and Genera are many of them new expressive and masterly He has ventured to alter some of the  Linnaean genera  with sufficient shew of reason  It might perhaps be mere accident that you saw so many swifts and no swallows at  Staines  because in my long observation of  those birds I never could discover the least degree of rivalry or hostility between the species  Ray  remarks that birds of the  gallinae order  as cocks and hens partridges and pheasants c are  pulveratrices  such as dust themselves using that method of cleansing their feathers and ridding themselves of their vermin As far as I can observe many birds that dust themselves never wash and I once thought that those birds that wash themselves would never dust but here I find myself mistaken for common housesparrows are great  pulveratrices  being frequently seen grovelling and wallowing in dusty roads and yet they are great washers Does not the skylark dust  Query  Might not  Mahomet  and his followers take one method of purification from these  pulveratrices  because I find from travellers of credit that if a strict mussulman is journeying in a sandy desert where no water is to be found at stated hours he strips off his clothes and most scrupulously rubs his body over with sand or dust  A countryman told me he had found a young  fernowl  in the nest of a small bird on the ground and that it was fed by the little bird I went to see this extraordinary phenomenon and found that it was a young cuckoo hatched in the nest of a titlark it was become vastly too big for it's nest appearing  in tenui re  Majores pennas nido extendisse  and was very fierce and pugnacious pursuing my finger as I teazed it for many feet from the nest and sparring and buffetting with it's wings like a gamecock The dupe of a dam appeared at a distance hovering about with meat in it's mouth and expressing the greatest solicitude  In  July  I saw several cuckoos skimming over a large pond and found after some observation that they were feeding on the  libellulae  or  dragonflies  some of which they caught as they settled on the weeds and some as they were on the wing Notwithstanding what  Linnaeus  says I cannot be induced to believe that they are birds of prey  This district affords some birds that are hardly ever heard of at  Selborne  In the first place considerable flocks of  crossbeaks loxiae curvirostrae  have appeared this summer in the pinegroves belonging to this house the  waterousel  is said to haunt the mouth of the  Lewes  river near  Newhaven  and the  Cornish chough  builds I know all along the chalky cliffs of the  Sussex  shore  I was greatly pleased to see little parties of  ringousels  my newly discovered migraters scattered at intervals all along the  Sussex  downs from  Chichester  to  Lewes  Let them come from whence they will it looks very suspicious that they are cantoned along the coast in order to pass the channel when severe weather advances They visit us again in  April  as it should seem in their return and are not to be found in the dead of winter It is remarkable that they are very tame and seem to have no manner of apprehensions of danger from a person with a gun There are bustards on the wide downs near  Brighthelmstone  No doubt you are acquainted with the  Sussex  downs the prospects and rides round  Lewes  are most lovely  As I rode along near the coast I kept a very sharp look out in the lanes and woods hoping I might at this time of the year have discovered some of the summer shortwinged birds of passage crowding towards the coast in order for their departure but it was very extraordinary that I never saw a redstart whitethroat blackcap uncrested wren slycatcher c And I remember to have made the same remark in former years as I usually come to  this place annually about this time The birds most common along the coast at present are the stonechatters whinchats buntings linnets some few wheatears titlarks c Swallows and housemartins abound yet induced to prolong their stay by this soft still dry season  A land tortoise which has been kept for thirty years in a little walled court belonging to the house where I now am visiting retires under ground about the middle of  November  and comes forth again about the middle of  April  When it first appears in the spring it discovers very little inclination towards food but in the height of summer grows voracious and then as the summer declines it's appetite declines so that for the last six weeks in autumn it hardly eats at all Milky plants such as lettuces dandelions sowthistles are it's favourite dish In a neighbouring village one was kept till by tradition it was supposed to be an hundred years old An instance of vast longevity in such a poor reptile  LETTER VIII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Dec  DEAR SIR  THE birds that I took for  aberdavines  were reedsparrows  passeres torquati  There are doubtless many home internal migrations within this kingdom that want to be better understood witness those vast slocks of hen chaffinches that appear with us in the winter without hardly any cocks among them Now was there a due proportion  of each sex it should seem very improbable that any one district should produce such numbers of these little birds and much more when only one half of the species appears therefore we may conclude that the  fringillae caelebes  for some good purposes have a peculiar migration of their own in which the sexes part Nor should it seem so wonderful that the intercourse of sexes in this species of birds should be interrupted in winter since in many animals and particularly in bucks and does the sexes herd separately except at the season when commerce is necessary for the continuance of the breed For this matter of the chaffinches see  Fauna Suecica  p and  Systema Naturae  p I see every winter vast flights of hen chaffinches but none of cocks  Your method of accounting for the periodical motions of the  British  singing birds or birds of flight is a very probable one since the matter of food is a great regulator of the actions and proceedings of the brute creation there is but one that can be set in competition with it and that is love But I cannot quite acquiesce with you in one circumstance when you advance that  "when they have thus feasted they again separate into small parties of five or six and get the best fare they can within a certain district having no inducement to go in quest of freshturned earth"  Now if you mean that the business of congregating is quite at an end from the conclusion of wheatsowing to the season of barley and oats it is not the case with us for larks and chaffinches and particularly linnets flock and congregate as much in the very dead of winter as when the husbandman is busy with his ploughs and harrows  Sure there can be no doubt but that woodcocks and fieldfares leave us in the spring in order to cross the seas and to retire to some districts more suitable to the purpose of breeding That the  former pair before they retire and that the hens are forward with egg I myself when I was a sportsman have often experienced It cannot indeed be denied but that now and then we hear of a woodcock's nest or young birds discovered in some part or other of this island but then they are always mentioned as rarities and somewhat out of the common course of things but as to redwings and fieldfares no sportsman or naturalist has ever yet that I could hear pretended to have found the nest or young of those species in any part of these kingdoms And I the more admire at this instance as extraordinary since to all appearance the same food in summer as well as in winter might support them here which maintains their congeners the blackbirds and thrushes did they chuse to stay the summer through From hence it appears that it is not food alone which determines some species of birds with regard to their stay or departure Fieldfares and redwings disappear sooner or later according as the warm weather comes on earlier or later For I well remember after that dreadful winter that cold northeast winds continued to blow on through  April  and  May  and that these kinds of birds what few remained of them did not depart as usual but were seen lingering about till the beginning of  June  The best authority that we can have for the nidisication of the birds above mentioned in any district is the testimony of faunists that have written professedly the natural history of particular countries Now as to the fieldfare  Linnaeus  in his Fauna Suecica says of it that  "  maximis in arboribus nidificat  "  and of the redwing he says in the same place that  "  nidificat in mediis arbusculis sive sepibus ova sex caeruleoviridia maculis nigris variis  "  Hence we may be assured that fieldfares and redwings breed in  Sweden Scopoli  says in his  Annus Primus  of the woodcock that  "  nupta ad nos venit circa aequinoctium vernale  "  meaning in  Tirol  of which he is a native And  afterwards he adds  "  nidificat in paludibus alpinis ova ponit  "  It does not appear from  Kramer  that woodcocks breed at all in  Austria  but he says  "  Avis haec septentrionalium provinciarum astivo tempore incola est

Feb  DEAR SIR  YOU are I know no great friend to migration and the well attested accounts from various parts of the kingdom seem to justify you in your suspicions that at least many of the swallow kind do  not leave us in the winter but lay themselves up like insects and bats in a torpid state and slumber away the more uncomfortable months till the return of the sun and fine weather awakens them  But then we must not I think deny migration in general because migration certainly does subsist in some places as my brother in  Andalusia  has fully informed me Of the motions of these birds he has ocular demonstration for many weeks together both spring and fall during which periods myriads of the swallow kind traverse the Straits from north to south and from south to north according to the season And these vast migrations consist not only of  hirundines  but of  beebirds hoopoes oro pendolos or golden thrushes  c c and also of many of our  softbilled summer birds of passage  and moreover of birds which never leave us such as all the various sorts of hawks and kites Old  Belon  two hundred years ago gives a curious account of the incredible armies of hawks and kites which he saw in the springtime traversing the  Thracian Bosphorus  from  Asia  to  Europe  Besides the above mentioned he remarks that the procession is swelled by whole troops of eagles and vultures  Now it is no wonder that birds residing in  Africa  should retreat before the sun as it advances and retire to milder regions and especially birds of prey whose blood being heated with hot animal food are more impatient of a sultry climate but then I cannot help wondering why kites and hawks and such hardy birds as are known to defy all the severity of  England  and even of  Sweden  and all north  Europe  should want to migrate from the south of  Europe  and be dissatisfied with the winters of  Andalusia  It does not appear to me that much stress may be laid on the difficulty and hazard that birds must run in their migrations by reason of vast oceans cross winds c because if we reflect a bird may travel from  England  to the equator without launching out and  exposing itself to boundless seas and that by crossing the water at  Dover  and again at  Gibraltar  And I with the more confidence advance this obvious remark because my brother has always found that some of his birds and particularly the swallow kind are very sparing of their pains in crossing the  Mediterranean  for when arrived at  Gibraltar  they do not  "Rang'd in figure wedge their way  "And set forth  "Their airy caravan high over seas  "Flying and over lands with mutual wing  "Easing their flight"  MILTON  but scout and hurry along in little detached parties of six or seven in a company and sweeping low just over the surface of the land and water direct their course to the opposite continent at the narrowest passage they can find They usually slope across the bay to the southwest and so pass over opposite to  Tangier  which it seems is the narrowest space  In former letters we have considered whether it was probable that woodcocks in moonshiny nights cross the  German  ocean from  Scandinavia  As a proof that birds of less speed may pass that sea considerable as it is I shall relate the following incident which though mentioned to have happened so many years ago was strictly matter of factAs some people were shooting in the parish of  Trotton  in the county of  Sussex  they killed a duck in that dreadful winter with a silver collar about it's neck  I have read a like anecdote of a swan  on which were engraven the arms of the king of  Denmark  This anecdote the rector of  Trotton  at that time has often told to a near relation of mine and to the best of my remembrance the collar was in the possession of the rector  At present I do not know any body near the seaside that will take the trouble to remark at what time of the moon woodcocks first come if I lived near the sea myself I would soon tell you more of the matter One thing I used to observe when I was a sportsman that there were times in which woodcocks were so sluggish and sleepy that they would drop again when flushed just before the spaniels nay just at the muzzle of a gun that had been fired at them whether this strange laziness was the effect of a recent fatiguing journey I shall not presume to say  Nightingales not only never reach  Northumberland  and  Scotland  but also as I have been always told  Devonshire  and  Cornwall  In those two last counties we cannot attribute the failure of them to the want of warmth the defect in the west is rather a presumptive argument that these birds come over to us from the continent at the narrowest passage and do not stroll so far westward  Let me hear from your own observation whether skylarks do not dust I think they do and if they do whether they wash also  The  alauda pratensis of Ray  was the poor dupe that was educating the booby of a cuckoo mentioned in my letter of  October  last  Your letter came too late for me to procure a ringousel for Mr  Tunstal  during their autumnal visit but I will endeavour to get him one when they call on us again in  April  I am glad that you and that gentleman saw my  Andalusian  birds I hope they answered your expectation  Royston  or grey crows are winter birds that come much about the same time with the woodcock they like the fieldfare and redwing have no apparent reason for migration for as they fare in the winter like their congeners so might they in all appearance in the summer Was not  Tenant  when a boy mistaken did he not find a misselthrush's nest and take it for the nest of a fieldfare  The stockdove or woodpigeon  oenas Raii  is the last winter bird of passage which appears with us and is not seen till towards the end of  November  about twenty years ago they abounded in the district of  Selborne  and strings of them were seen morning and evening that reached a mile or more but since the beechen woods have been greatly thinned they are much decreased in number The ringdove  palumbus Raii  stays with us the whole year and breeds several times through the summer  Before I received your letter of  October  last I had just remarked in my journal that the trees were unusually green This uncommon verdure lasted on late into  November  and may be accounted for from a late spring a cool and moist summer but more particularly from vast armies of chafers or treebeetles which in many places reduced whole woods to a leafless naked state These trees shot again at  Midsummer  and then retained their foliage till very late in the year  My musical friend at whose house I am now visiting has tried all the owls that are his near neighbours with a pitchpipe set at concertpitch and finds they all hoot in B flat He will examine the nightingales next spring  I am c c  LETTER X TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Aug  DEAR SIR  FROM what follows it will appear that neither owls nor cuckoos keep to one note A friend remarks that many most of his owls hoot in B flat but that one went almost half a note below A The pipe he tried their notes by was a common halfcrown pitchpipe such as masters use for tuning of harpsichords it was the common  London  pitch  A neighbour of mine who is said to have a nice ear remarks that the owls about this village hoot in three different keys in G flat or F sharp in B flat and A flat He heard two hooting to each other the one in A flat and the other in B flat  Query  Do these different notes proceed from different species or only from various individuals The same person finds upon trial that the note of the cuckoo of which we have but one species varies in different individuals for about  Selborne  wood he found they were mostly in D he heard two sing together the one in D the other in D sharp who made a disagreeable concert he afterwards heard one in D sharp and about  Woolmerforest  some in C As to nightingales he says that their notes are so short and their transitions so rapid that he cannot well ascertain their key Perhaps in a cage and in a room their notes may be more distinguishable This person has tried to settle the notes of a swift and of several other small birds but cannot bring them to any criterion  As I have often remarked that redwings are some of the first birds that suffer with us in severe weather it is no wonder at all that they retreat from  Scandinavian  winters and much more the  ordo  of  grallae  who all to a bird forsake the northern parts of  Europe  at the approach of winter  "  Grallae tanquam conjuratae unanimiter in fugam se conjiciunt ne earum unicam quidem inter nos habitantem invenire possimus ut enim aestate in australibus degere nequeunt ob defectum lumbricorum terramque siccam ita nec in frigidis ob eandem causam  "  says  Ekmarck  the  Swede  in his ingenious little treatise called  Migrationes Avium  which by all means you ought to read while your thoughts run on the subject of migration See  Amaenitates Academicae  vol p  Birds may be so circumstanced as to be obliged to migrate in one country and not in another but the  grallae  which procure their food from marshes and boggy grounds must in winter forsake the more northerly parts of  Europe  or perish for want of food  I am glad you are making inquiries from  Linnaeus  concerning the woodcock it is expected of him that he should be able to account for the motions and manner of life of the animals of his own  Fauna  Faunists  as you observe are too apt to acquiesce in bare descriptions and a few synonyms the reason is plain because all that may be done at home in a man's study but the investigation of the life and conversation of animals is a concern of much more trouble and difficulty and is not to be attained but by the active and inquisitive and by those that reside much in the country  Foreign systematics are I observe much too vague in their specific differences which are almost universally constituted by one or two particular marks the rest of the description running in general terms But our countryman the excellent Mr  Ray  is  the only describer that conveys some precise idea in every term or word maintaining his superiority over his followers and imitators in spite of the advantage of fresh discoveries and modern information  At this distance of years it is not in my power to recollect at what periods woodcocks used to be sluggish or alert when I was a sportsman but upon my mentioning this circumstance to a friend he thinks he has observed them to be remarkably listless against snowy foul weather if this should be the case then the inaptitude for flying arises only from an eagerness for food as sheep are observed to be very intent on grazing against stormy wet evenings  I am c c  LETTER XI TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Feb  DEAR SIR  WHEN I ride about in the winter and see such prodigious flocks of various kinds of birds I cannot help admiring at these congregations and wishing that it was in my power to account for those appearances almost peculiar to the season The two great motives which regulate the proceedings of the brute creation are love and hunger the former incites animals to perpetuate their kind the  latter induces them to preserve individuals whether either of these should seem to be the ruling passion in the matter of congregating is to be considered As to love that is out of the question at a time of the year when that soft passion is not indulged besides during the amorous season such a jealousy prevails between the male birds that they can hardly bear to be together in the same hedge or field Most of the singing and elation of spirits of that time seem to me to be the effect of rivalry and emulation and it is to this spirit of jealousy that I chiefly attribute the equal dispersion of birds in the spring over the face of the country  Now as to the business of food as these animals are actuated by instinct to hunt for necessary food they should not one would suppose crowd together in pursuit of sustenance at a time when it is most likely to fail yet such associations do take place in hard weather chiefly and thicken as the severity increases As some kind of selfinterest and selfdefence is no doubt the motive for the proceeding may it not arise from the helplessness of their state in such rigorous seasons as men crowd together when under great calamities though they know not why Perhaps approximation may dispel some degree of cold and a crowd may make each individual appear safer from the ravages of birds of prey and other dangers  If I admire when I see how much congenerous birds love to congregate I am the more struck when I see incongruous ones in such strict amity If we do not much wonder to see a flock of rooks usually attended by a train of daws yet it is strange that the former should so frequently have a flight of starlings for their satellites Is it because rooks have a more discerning scent than their attenddants and can lead them to spots more productive of food Anatomists say that rooks by reason of two large nerves which run down between the eyes into the upper mandible have a more delicate feeling in their beaks than other roundbilled birds and can grope  for their meat when out of sight Perhaps then their associates attend them on the motive of interest as greyhounds wait on the motions of their finders and as lions are said to do on the yelpings of jackalls Lapwings and starlings sometimes associate  LETTER XII TO THE SAME  March  DEAR SIR  AS a gentleman and myself were walking on the fourth of last  November  round the seabanks at  Newhaven  near the mouth of the  Lewes  river in pursuit of natural knowledge we were surprised to see three houseswallows gliding very swiftly by us That morning was rather chilly with the wind at northwest but the tenor of the weather for some time before had been delicate and the noons remarkably warm From this incident and from repeated accounts which I meet with I am more and more induced to believe that many of the swallow kind do not depart from this island but lay themselves up in holes and caverns and do insectlike and batlike come forth at mild times and then retire again to their  latebrae  Nor make I the least doubt but that if I lived at  Newhaven Seaford Brighthelmstone  or any of those towns near the chalkcliffs of the  Sussex  coast by proper observations I should see swallows stirring at periods of the winter when the noons were soft and inviting and the sun warm and invigorating And I am the more of this  opinion from what I have remarked during some of our late springs that though some swallows did make their appearance about the usual time  viz  the thirteenth or fourteenth of  April  yet meeting with an harsh reception and blustering cold northeast winds they immediately withdrew absconding for several days till the weather gave them better encouragement  LETTER XIII TO THE SAME  April  DEAR SIR  WHILE I was in  Sussex  last autumn my residence was at the village near  Lewes  from whence I had formerly the pleasure of writing to you On the first of  November  I remarked that the old tortoise formerly mentioned began first to dig the ground in order to the forming it's hybernaculum which it had fixed on just beside a great tuft of hepaticas It scrapes out the ground with it's forefeet and throws it up over it's back with it's hind but the motion of it's legs is ridiculously slow little exceeding the hourhand of a clock and suitable to the composure of an animal said to be a whole month in performing one feat of copulation Nothing can be more assiduous than this creature night and day in scooping the earth and forcing it's great body into the cavity but as the noons of that season proved unusually warm and sunny it was continually interrupted and called forth by the heat in the middle of the day  and though I continued there till the thirteenth of  November  yet the work remained unfinished Harsher weather and frosty mornings would have quickened it's operations No part of it's behaviour ever struck me more than the extreme timidity it always expresses with regard to rain for though it has a shell that would secure it against the wheel of a loaded cart yet does it discover as much solicitude about rain as a lady dressed in all her best attire shuffling away on the first sprinklings and running it's head up in a corner If attended to it becomes an excellent weatherglass for as sure as it walks elate and as it were on tiptoe feeding with great earnestness in a morning so sure will it rain before night It is totally a diurnal animal and never pretends to stir after it becomes dark The tortoise like other reptiles has an arbitrary stomach as well as lungs and can refrain from eating as well as breathing for a great part of the year When first awakened it eats nothing nor again in the autumn before it retires through the height of the summer it feeds voraciously devouring all the food that comes in it's way I was much taken with it's sagacity in discerning those that do it kind offices for as soon as the good old lady comes in sight who has waited on it for more than thirty years it hobbles towards it's benefactress with aukward alacrity but remains inattentive to strangers Thus not only  "  the ox knoweth his owner and the ass his master's crib  Isaiah i  "  but the most abject reptile and torpid of beings distinguishes the hand that feeds it and is touched with the feelings of gratitude  I am c c  PS In about three days after I left  Sussex  the tortoise retired into the ground under the hepatica  LETTER XIV TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  March  DEAR SIR  THE more I reflect on the  of animals the more I am astonished at it's effects Nor is the violence of this affection more wonderful than the shortness of it's duration Thus every hen is in her turn the virago of the yard in proportion to the helplessness of her brood and will fly in the face of a dog or a sow in defence of those chickens which in a few weeks she will drive before her with relentless cruelty  This affection sublimes the passions quickens the invention and sharpens the sagacity of the brute creation Thus an hen just become a mother is no longer that placid bird she used to be but with feathers standing an end wings hovering and clocking note she runs about like one possessed Dams will throw themselves in the way of the greatest danger in order to avert it from their progeny Thus a partridge will tumble along before a sportsman in order to draw away the dogs from her helpless covey In the time of nidification the most feeble birds will assault the most rapacious All the hirundines of a village are up in arms at the sight of an hawk whom they will persecute till he leaves that district A very exact observer has often remarked that a pair of ravens nesting in the rock of  Gibraltar  would suffer no vulture or eagle to rest near their station but would drive them from the hill with an amazing fury even the  blue thrush at the season of breeding would dart out from the clefts of the rocks to chase away the kestril or the sparrowhawk If you stand near the nest of a bird that has young she will not be induced to betray them by an inadvertent fondness but will wait about at a distance with meat in her mouth for an hour together  Should I farther corroborate what I have advanced above by some anecdotes which I probably may have mentioned before in conversation yet you will I trust pardon the repetition for the sake of the illustration  The flycatcher of the Zoology the  stoparola  of  Ray  builds every year in the vines that grow on the walls of my house A pair of these little birds had one year inadvertently placed their nest on a naked bough perhaps in a shady time not being aware of the inconvenience that followed But an hot sunny season coming on before the brood was half fledged the reflection of the wall became insupportable and must inevitably have destroyed the tender young had not affection suggested an expedient and prompted the parentbirds to hover over the nest all the hotter hours while with wings expanded and mouths gaping for breath they screened off the heat from their suffering offspring  A farther instance I once saw of notable sagacity in a willowwren which had built in a bank in my fields This bird a friend and myself had observed as she sat in her nest but were particularly careful not to disturb her though we saw she eyed us with some degree of jealousy Some days after as we passed that way we were desirous of remarking how this brood went on but no nest could be found till I happened to take up a large bundle of long green moss as it were carelessly thrown over the nest in order to dodge the eye of any impertinent intruder  A still more remarkable mixture of sagacity and instinct occurred to me one day as my people were pulling off the lining of an hotbed in order to add some fresh dung From out of the side of this bed leaped an animal with great agility that made a most grotesque figure nor was it without great difficulty that it could be taken when it proved to be a large whitebellied fieldmouse with three or four young clinging to her teats by their mouths and feet It was amazing that the desultory and rapid motions of this dam should not oblige her litter to quit their hold especially when it appeared that they were so young as to be both naked and blind  To these instances of tender attachment many more of which might be daily discovered by those that are studious of nature may be opposed that rage of affection that monstrous perversion of the  which induces some females of the brute creation to devour their young because their owners have handled them too freely or removed them from place to place Swine and sometimes the more gentle race of dogs and cats are guilty of this horrid and preposterous murder When I hear now and then of an abandoned mother that destroys her offspring I am not so much amazed since reason perverted and the bad passions let loose are capable of any enormity but why the parental feelings of brutes that usually flow in one most uniform tenor should sometimes be so extravagantly diverted I leave to abler philosophers than myself to determine  I am c  LETTER XV TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  July  DEAR SIR  SOME young men went down lately to a pond on the verge of  Wolmerforest  to hunt flappers or young wildducks many of which they caught and among the rest some very minute yet wellfledged wildfowls alive which upon examination I found to be teals I did not know till then that teals ever bred in the south of  England  and was much pleased with the discovery this I look upon as a great stroke in natural history  We have had ever since I can remember a pair of white owls that constantly breed under the eaves of this church As I have paid good attention to the manner of life of these birds during their season of breeding which lasts the summer through the following remarks may not perhaps be unacceptableAbout an hour before sunset for then the mice begin to run they sally forth in quest of prey and hunt all round the hedges of meadows and small enclosures for them which seem to be their only food In this irregular country we can stand on an eminence and see them beat the fields over like a settingdog and often drop down in the grass or corn I have minuted these birds with my watch for an hour together and have found that they return to their nest the one or the other of them about once in five minutes reflecting at the same time on the adroitness that every animal is possessed of as far as regards the well being of itself and offspring  But a piece of address which they shew when they return loaded should not I think be passed over in silenceAs they take their prey with their claws so they carry it in their claws to their nest but as the feet are necessary in their ascent under the tiles they constantly perch first on the roof of the chancel and shift the mouse from their claws to their bill that the feet may be at liberty to take hold of the plate on the wall as they are rising under the eaves  White owls seem not but in this I am not positive to hoot at all all that clamorous hooting appears to me to come from the wood kinds The white owl does indeed snore and hiss in a tremendous manner and these menaces well answer the intention of intimidating for I have known a whole village up in arms on such an occasion imagining the churchyard to be full of goblins and spectres White owls also often scream horribly as they fly along from this screaming probably arose the common people's imaginary species of  screechowl  which they superstitiously think attends the windows of dying persons The plumage of the remiges of the wings of every species of owl that I have yet examined is remarkably soft and pliant Perhaps it may be necessary that the wings of these birds should not make much resistance or rushing that they may be enabled to steal through the air unheard upon a nimble and watchful quarry  While I am talking of owls it may not be improper to mention what I was told by a gentleman of the county of  Wilts  As they were grubbing a vast hollow pollardash that had been the mansion of owls for centuries he discovered at the bottom a mass of matter that at first he could not account for After some examination he found that it was a congeries of the bones of mice and perhaps of birds and bats that had been heaping together  for ages being cast up in pellets out of the crops of many generations of inhabitants For owls cast up the bones fur and feathers of what they devour after the manner of hawks He believes he told me that there were bushels of this kind of substance  When brown owls hoot their throats swell as big as an hen's egg I have known an owl of this species live a full year without any water Perhaps the case may be the same with all birds of prey When owls fly they stretch out their legs behind them as a balance to their large heavy heads for as most nocturnal birds have large eyes and ears they must have large heads to contain them Large eyes I presume are necessary to collect every ray of light and large concave ears to command the smallest degree of sound or noise  I am c  It will be proper to premise here that the sixteenth eighteenth twentieth and twentyfirst letters have been published already in the Philosophical Transactions but as nicer observation has furnished several corrections and additions it is hoped that the republication of them will not give offence especially as these sheets would be very imperfect without them and as they will be new to many readers who had no opportunity of seeing them when they made their first appearance  The  hirundines  are a most inoffensive harmless entertaining social and useful tribe of birds they touch no fruit in our gardens delight all except one species in attaching themselves to our houses amuse us with their migrations songs and marvellous agility and clear our outlets from the annoyances of gnats and other troublesome insects Some districts in the south seas near  Guiaquil  See  Ulloa  's Travels  are desolated it seems by the infinite swarms of venomous mosquitoes which fill the air and render those coasts insupportable It would be worth inquiring whether any species of  hirundines  is found in those regions Whoever contemplates the myriads of insects that sport in the sunbeams of a summer evening in this country will soon be convinced to what a degree our atmosphere would be choaked with them was it not for the friendly interposition of the swallow tribe  Many species of birds have their peculiar  lice  but the  hirundines  alone seem to be annoyed with  dipterous  insects which infest every species and are so large in proportion to themselves that they must be extremely irksome and injurious to them These are the  hippoboscae hirundinis  with narrow subulated wings abounding in every nest and are hatched by the warmth of the bird's own body during incubation and crawl about under it's feathers  A  species  of them is familiar to horsemen in the south of  England  under the name of  forestfly  and to some of  sidefly  from it's runing sideways like a crab It creeps under the tails and about the groins of horses which at their first coming out of the north are rendered half frantic by the tickling sensation while our own breed little regards them  The curious  Reaumur  discovered the large eggs or rather  pupae  of these flies as big as the flies themselves which he hatched in his own bosom Any person that will take the trouble to examine the old nests of either species of swallows may find in them the black shining cases or skins of the  pupae  of these insects but for other particulars too long for this place we refer the reader to  l' Histoire d' Insectes  of that admirable entomologist Tom iv pl  LETTER XVI TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Nov  DEAR SIR  IN obedience to your injunctions I sit down to give you some account of the housemartin or martlet and if my monography of this little domestic and familiar bird should happen to meet with your approbation I may probably soon extend my inquiries to the rest of the  British hirundines  the swallow the swift and the bankmartin  A few housemartins begin to appear about the sixteenth of  April  usually some few days later than the swallow For some time after they appear the hirundines in general pay no attention to the business of nidification but play and sport about either to recruit from the fatigue of their journey if they do migrate at all or else that their blood may recover it's true tone and texture after it has been so long benumbed by the severities of winter About the middle of  May  if the weather be fine the martin begins to think in earnest of providing a mansion for it's family The crust or shell of this nest seems to be formed of such dirt or loam as comes most readily to hand and is tempered and wrought together with little bits of broken straws to render it tough and tenacious As this bird often builds against a perpendicular wall without any projecting ledge under it requires it's utmost efforts to get the first foundation firmly fixed so that it may safely carry the superstructure On this occasion the bird not only clings with it's claws  but partly supports itself by strongly inclining it's tail against the wall making that a fulcrum and thus steadied it works and plasters the materials into the face of the brick or stone But then that this work may not while it is soft and green pull itself down by it's own weight the provident architect has prudence and forbearance enough not to advance her work too fast but by building only in the morning and by dedicating the rest of the day to food and amusement gives it sufficient time to dry and harden About half an inch seems to be a sufficient layer for a day Thus careful workmen when they build mudwalls informed at first perhaps by this little bird raise but a moderate layer at a time and then desist lest the work should become topheavy and so be ruined by it's own weight By this method in about ten or twelve days is formed an hemispheric nest with a small aperture towards the top strong compact and warm and perfectly fitted for all the purposes for which it was intended But then nothing is more common than for the housesparrow as soon as the shell is finished to seize on it as it's own to eject the owner and to line it after it's own manner  After so much labour is bestowed in erecting a mansion as Nature seldom works in vain martins will breed on for several years together in the same nest where it happens to be well sheltered and secure from the injuries of weather The shell or crust of the nest is a sort of rusticwork full of knobs and protuberances on the outside nor is the inside of those that I have examined smoothed with any exactness at all but is rendered soft and warm and fit for incubation by a lining of small straws grasses and feathers and sometimes by a bed of moss interwoven with wool In this nest they tread or engender frequently during the time of building and the hen lays from three to five white eggs  At first when the young are hatched and are in a naked and helpless condition the parent birds with tender assiduity carry out what comes away from their young Was it not for this affectionate cleanliness the nestlings would soon be burnt up and destroyed in so deep and hollow a nest by their own caustic excrement In the quadruped creation the same neat precaution is made use of particularly among dogs and cats where the dams lick away what proceeds from their young But in birds there seems to be a particular provision that the dung of nestlings is enveloped in a tough kind of jelly and therefore is the easier conveyed off without soiling or daubing Yet as nature is cleanly in all her ways the young perform this office for themselves in a little time by thrusting their tails out at the aperture of their nest As the young of small birds presently arrive at their  or full growth they soon become impatient of confinement and sit all day with their heads out at the orifice where the dams by clinging to the nest supply them with food from morning to night For a time the young are fed on the wing by their parents but the feat is done by so quick and almost imperceptible a slight that a person must have attended very exactly to their motions before he would be able to perceive it As soon as the young are able to shift for themselves the dams immediately turn their thoughts to the business of a second brood while the first flight shaken off and rejected by their nurses congregate in great flocks and are the birds that are seen clustering and hovering on sunny mornings and evenings round towers and steeples and on the roofs of churches and houses These congregatings usually begin to take place about the first week in  August  and therefore we may conclude that by that time the first flight is pretty well over The young of this species do not quit their abodes all together but the more forward birds get abroad some days  before the rest These approaching the eaves of buildings and playing about before them make people think that several old ones attend one nest They are often capricious in fixing on a nestingplace beginning many edifices and leaving them unfinished but when once a nest is completed in a sheltered place it serves for several seasons Those which breed in a ready finished house get the start in hatching of those that build new by ten days or a fortnight These industrious artificers are at their labours in the long days before four in the morning when they fix their materials they plaster them on with their chins moving their heads with a quick vibratory motion They dip and wash as they fly sometimes in very hot weather but not so frequently as swallows It has been observed that martins usually build to a northeast or northwest aspect that the heat of the sun may not crack and destroy their nests but instances are also remembered where they bred for many years in vast abundance in an hot stifled innyard against a wall facing to the south  Birds in general are wise in their choice of situation but in this neighbourhood every summer is seen a strong proof to the contrary at an house without eaves in an exposed district where some martins build year by year in the corners of the windows But as the corners of these windows which face to the southeast and southwest are too shallow the nests are washed down every hard rain and yet these birds drudge on to no purpose from summer to summer without changing their aspect or house It is a piteous sight to see them labouring when half their nest is washed away and bringing dirt  "  generis lapsi sarcire ruinas  "  Thus is instinct a most wonderful unequal faculty in some instances so much above reason in other respects so far below it Martins love to frequent towns especially if there are great lakes and rivers at hand nay  they even affect the close air of  London  And I have not only seen them nesting in the  Borough  but even in the  Strand  and  Fleetstreet  but then it was obvious from the dinginess of their aspect that their feathers partook of the filth of that sooty atmosphere Martins are by far the least agile of the four species their wings and tails are short and therefore they are not capable of such surprising turns and quick and glancing evolutions as the swallow Accordingly they make use of a placid easy motion in a middle region of the air seldom mounting to any great height and never sweeping long together over the surface of the ground or water They do not wander far for food but affect sheltered districts over some lake or under some hanging wood or in some hollow vale especially in windy weather They breed the latest of all the swallow kind in they had nestlings on to  October  the twentyfirst and are never without unfledged young as late as  Michaelmas  As the summer declines the congregating flocks increase in numbers daily by the constant accession of the second broods till at last they swarm in myriads upon myriads round the villages on the  Thames  darkening the face of the sky as they frequent the aits of that river where they roost They retire the bulk of them I mean in vast flocks together about the beginning of  October  but have appeared of late years in a considerable flight in this neighbourhood for one day or two as late as  November  the third and sixth after they were supposed to have been gone for more than a fortnight They therefore withdraw with us the latest of any species Unless these birds are very shortlived indeed or unless they do not return to the district where they are bred they must undergo vast devastations some how and some where for the birds that return yearly bear no manner of proportion to the birds that retire  Housemartins are distinguished from their congeners by having their legs covered with soft downy feathers down to their toes They are no songsters but twitter in a pretty inward soft manner in their nests During the time of breeding they are often greatly molested with fleas  I am c  LETTER XVII TO THE SAME  RINGMER near LEWES  Dec  DEAR SIR  I RECEIVED your last favour just as I was setting out for this place and am pleased to find that my monography met with your approbation My remarks are the result of many years observation and are I trust true in the whole though I do not pretend to say that they are perfectly void of mistake or that a more nice observer might not make many additions since subjects of this kind are inexhaustible  If you think my letter worthy the notice of your respectable society you are at liberty to lay it before them and they will consider it I hope as it was intended as an humble attempt to promote a more minute inquiry into natural history into the life and conversation of animals Perhaps hereafter I may be induced to take the houseswallow under consideration and from that proceed to the rest of the  British hirundines  Though I have now travelled the  Sussexdowns  upwards of thirty years yet I still investigate that chain of majestic mountains with fresh admiration year by year and think I see new beauties every time I traverse it This range which runs from  Chichester  eastward as far as  EastBourn  is about sixty miles in length and is called  The South Downs  properly speaking only round  Lewes  As you pass along you command a noble view of the wild or weald on one hand and the broad downs and sea on the other Mr  Ray  used to visit a family  Mr  Courthope  of  Danny  just at the foot of these hills and was so ravished with the prospect from  Plumptonplain  near  Lewes  that he mentions those scapes in his "Wisdom of God in the Works of the Creation" with the utmost satisfaction and thinks them equal to any thing he had seen in the finest parts of  Europe  For my own part I think there is somewhat peculiarly sweet and amusing in the shapely figured aspect of chalkhills in preference to those of stone which are rugged broken abrupt and shapeless  Perhaps I may be singular in my opinion and not so happy as to convey to you the same idea but I never contemplate these mountains without thinking I perceive somewhat analogous to growth in their gentle swellings and smooth funguslike protuberances their fluted sides and regular hollows and slopes that carry at once the air of vegetative dilation and expansion  Or was there ever a time when these immense masses of calcarious matter were thrown into fermentation by some adventitious moisture were raised and leavened into such shapes by some plastic power and so made to swell and heave their broad backs into the sky so much above the less animated clay of the wild below  By what I can guess from the admeasurements of the hills that have been taken round my house I should suppose that these hills surmount the wild at an average at about the rate of five hundred feet  One thing is very remarkable as to the sheep from the westward till you get to the river  Adur  all the flocks have horns and smooth white faces and white legs and a hornless sheep is rarely to be seen but as soon as you pass that river eastward and mount  Beedinghill  all the flocks at once become hornless or as they call them pollsheep and have moreover black faces with a white tuft of wool on their foreheads and speckled and spotted legs so that you would think that the flocks of  Laban  were pasturing on one side of the stream and the variegated breed of his soninlaw  Jacob  were cantoned along on the other And this diversity holds good respectively on each side from the valley of  Bramber  and  Beeding  to the eastward and westward all the whole length of the downs If you talk with the shepherds on this subject they tell you that the case has been so from time immemorial and smile at your simplicity if you ask them whether the situation of these two different breeds might not be reversed However an intelligent friend of mine near  Chichester  is determined to try the experiment and has this autumn at the hazard of being laughed at introduced a parcel of blackfaced hornless rams among his horned western ewes The blackfaced pollsheep have the shortest legs and the finest wool  As I had hardly ever before travelled these downs at so late a season of the year I was determined to keep as sharp a lookout as possible so near the southern coast with respect to the summer shortwinged birds of passage We make great inquiries concerning the withdrawing of the swallow kind without examining enough into  the causes why  this tribe  is never to be seen in winter for  entre nous  the disappearing of the latter is more marvellous than that of the former and much more unaccountable The  hirundines  if they please are certainly capable of migration and yet no doubt are often found in a torpid state but redstarts nightingales whitethroats blackcaps c c are very ill provided for long flights have never been once found as I ever heard of in a torpid state and yet can never be supposed in such troops from year to year to dodge and elude the eyes of the curious and inquisitive which from day to day discern the other small birds that are known to abide our winters But notwithstanding all my care I saw nothing like a summer bird of passage and what is more strange not one wheatear though they abound so in the autumn as to be a considerable perquisite to the shepherds that take them and though many are to be seen to my knowledge all the winter through in many parts of the south of  England  The most intelligent shepherds tell me that some few of these birds appear on the downs in  March  and then withdraw to breed probably in warrens and stonequarries now and then a nest is plowed up in a fallow on the downs under a furrow but it is thought a rarity At the time of wheatharvest they begin to be taken in great numbers are sent for sale in vast quantities to  Brighthelmstone  and  Tunbridge  and appear at the tables of all the gentry that entertain with any degree of elegance About  Michaelmas  they retire and are seen no more till  March  Though these birds are when in season in great plenty on the south downs round  Lewes  yet at  EastBourn  which is the eastern extremity of those downs they abound much more One thing is very remarkablethat though in the height of the season so many hundreds of dozens are taken yet they never are seen to slock and it is a rare thing to see more than three or four at a time so that there  must be a perpetual flitting and constant progressive succession It does not appear that any wheatears are taken to the westward of  Houghtonbridge  which stands on the river  Arun  I did not fail to look particularly after my new migration of  ringousels  and to take notice whether they continued on the downs to this season of the year as I had formerly remarked them in the month of  October  all the way from  Chichester  to  Lewes  whereever there were any shrubs and covert but not one bird of this sort came within my observation I only saw a few  larks  and  whinchats  some  rooks  and several  kites  and  buzzards  About  Midsummer  a flight of  crossbills  comes to the pinegroves about this house but never makes any long stay  The old tortoise that I have mentioned in a former letter still continues in this garden and retired under ground about the twentieth of  November  and came out again for one day on the thirtieth it lies now buried in a wet swampy border under a wall facing to the south and is enveloped at present in mud and mire  Here is a large rookery round this house the inhabitants of which seem to get their livelihood very easily for they spend the greatest part of the day on their nesttrees when the weather is mild These rooks retire every evening all the winter from this rookery where they only call by the way as they are going to roost in deep woods at the dawn of day they always revisit their nesttrees and are preceded a few minutes by a flight of daws that act as it were as their harbingers  I am c  LETTER XVIII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Jan  DEAR SIR  THE houseswallow or chimneyswallow is undoubtedly the first comer of all the  British hirundines  and appears in general on or about the thirteenth of  April  as I have remarked from many years observation Not but now and then a straggler is seen much earlier and in particular when I was a boy I observed a swallow for a whole day together on a sunny warm  Shrove Tuesday  which day could not fall out later than the middle of  March  and often happened early in  February  It is worth remarking that these birds are seen first about lakes and millponds and it is also very particular that if these early visiters happen to find frost and snow as was the case of the two dreadful springs of and they immediately withdraw for a time A circumstance this much more in favour of hiding than migration since it is much more probable that a bird should retire to it's hybernaculum just at hand than return for a week or two only to warmer latitudes  The swallow though called the chimneyswallow by no means builds altogether in chimnies but often within barns and outhouses against the rafters and so she did in  Virgil  's time  "Antè  "Garrula quàm tignis nidos suspendat hirundo"  In  Sweden  she builds in barns and is called  ladu swala  the barnswallow Besides in the warmer parts of  Europe  there are no chimnies to houses except they are  Englishbuilt  in these countries she constructs her nest in porches and gateways and galleries and open halls  Here and there a bird may affect some odd peculiar place as we have known a swallow build down the shaft of an old well through which chalk had been formerly drawn up for the purpose of manure but in general with us this  hirundo  breeds in chimnies and loves to haunt those stacks where there is a constant fire no doubt for the sake of warmth Not that it can subsist in the immediate shaft where there is a fire but prefers one adjoining to that of the kitchen and disregards the perpetual smoke of that funnel as I have often observed with some degree of wonder  Five or six or more feet down the chimney does this little bird begin to form her nest about the middle of  May  which consists like that of the housemartin of a crust or shell composed of dirt or mud mixed with short pieces of straw to render it tough and permanent with this difference that whereas the shell of the martin is nearly hemispheric that of the swallow is open at the top and like half a deep dish this nest is lined with fine grasses and feathers which are often collected as they float in the air  Wonderful is the address which this adroit bird shews all day long in ascending and descending with security through so narrow a pass When hovering over the mouth of the funnel the vibrations of her wings acting on the confined air occasion a rumbling like thunder It is not improbable that the dam submits to this inconvenient situation so low in the shaft in order to secure her broods from rapacious birds and particularly from owls which  frequently fall down chimnies perhaps in attempting to get at these nestlings  The swallow lays from four to six white eggs dotted with red specks and brings out her first brood about the last week in  June  or the first week in  July  The progressive method by which the young are introduced into life is very amusing first they emerge from the shaft with difficulty enough and often fall down into the rooms below for a day or so they are fed on the chimneytop and then are conducted to the dead leafless bough of some tree where sitting in a row they are attended with great assiduity and may then be called  perchers  In a day or two more they become  flyers  but are still unable to take their own food therefore they play about near the place where the dams are hawking for flies and when a mouthful is collected at a certain signal given the dam and the nestling advance rising towards each other and meeting at an angle the young one all the while uttering such a little quick note of gratitude and complacency that a person must have paid very little regard to the wonders of Nature that has not often remarked this feat  The dam betakes herself immediately to the business of a second brood as soon as she is disengaged from her first which at once associates with the first broods of  housemartins  and with them congregates clustering on sunny roofs towers and trees This hirundo brings out her second brood towards the middle and end of  August  All the summer long is the swallow a most instructive pattern of unwearied industry and affection for from morning to night while there is a family to be supported she spends the whole day in skimming close to the ground and exerting the most sudden turns and quick evolutions Avenues and long walks under  hedges and pasturefields and mown meadows where cattle graze are her delight especially if there are trees interspersed because in such spots insects most abound When a fly is taken a smart snap from her bill is heard resembling the noise at the shutting of a watchcase but the motion of the mandibles are too quick for the eye  The swallow probably the male bird is the  excubitor  to housemartins and other little birds announcing the approach of birds of prey For as soon as an hawk appears with a shrill alarming note he calls all the swallows and martins about him who pursue in a body and buffet and strike their enemy till they have driven him from the village darting down from above on his back and rising in a perpendicular line in perfect security This bird also will sound the alarm and strike at cats when they climb on the roofs of houses or otherwise approach the nests Each species of hirundo drinks as it flies along sipping the surface of the water but the swallow alone in general  washes  on the wing by dropping into a pool for many times together in very hot weather housemartins and bankmartins dip and wash a little  The swallow is a delicate songster and in soft sunny weather sings both perching and flying on trees in a kind of concert and on chimney tops is also a bold flyer ranging to distant downs and commons even in windy weather which the other species seem much to dislike nay even frequenting exposed seaport towns and making little excursions over the salt water Horsemen on wide downs are often closely attended by a little party of swallows for miles together which plays before and behind them sweeping around and collecting all the sculking insects that are roused by the trampling of the horses feet when the wind blows hard without this expedient they are often forced to settle to pick up their lurking prey  This species feeds much on little  coleoptera  as well as on gnats and flies and often settles on dug ground or paths for gravels to grind and digest it's food Before they depart for some weeks to a bird they forsake houses and chimnies and roost in trees and usually withdraw about the beginning of  October  though some few stragglers may appear on at times till the first week in  November  Some few pairs haunt the new and open streets of  London  next the fields but do not enter like the housemartin the close and crowded parts of the city  Both male and female are distinguished from their congeners by the length and forkedness of their tails They are undoubtedly the most nimble of all the species and when the male pursues the female in amorous chase they then go beyond their usual speed and exert a rapidity almost too quick for the eye to follow  After this circumstantial detail of the life and discerning  of the swallow I shall add for your farther amusement an anecdote or two not much in favour of her sagacity  A certain swallow built for two years together on the handles of a pair of gardenshears that were stuck up against the boards in an outhouse and therefore must have her nest spoiled whenever that implement was wanted and what is stranger still another bird of the same species built it's nest on the wings and body of an owl that happened by accident to hang dead and dry from the rafter of a barn This owl with the nest on it's wings and with eggs in the nest was brought as a curiosity worthy the most elegant private museum in  GreatBritain  The owner struck with the oddity of the sight furnished the bringer with a large shell or conch desiring him to fix it just where the owl hung the person did as he was ordered and the following year a pair probably  the same pair built their nest in the conch and laid their eggs  The owl and the conch make a strange grotesque appearance and are not the least curious specimens in that wonderful collection of art and nature  Sir  Ashton Lever  's Musaeum    Thus is instinct in animals taken the least out of it's way an undistinguishing limited faculty and blind to every circumstance that does not immediately respect selfpreservation or lead at once to the propagation or support of their species  I am With all respect c c  LETTER XIX TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Feb  DEAR SIR  I RECEIVED your favour of the eighth and am pleased to find that you read my little history of the swallow wtih your usual candour nor was I the less pleased to find that you made objections where you saw reason  As to the quotations it is difficult to say precisely which species of hirundo  Virgil  might intend in the lines in question since the ancients did not attend to specific differences like modern naturalists yet somewhat may be gathered enough to incline me to suppose that in the two passages quoted the poet had his eye on the swallow  In the first place the epithet  garrula  suits the  swallow  well who is a great songster and not the  martin  which is rather a mute bird and when it sings is so inward as scarce to be heard Besides if  tignum  in that place signifies a  rafter  rather than a  beam  as it seems to me to do then I think it must be the  swallow  that is alluded to and not the  martin  since the former does frequently build  within the roof  against the  rafters  while the latter always as far as I have been able to observe builds  without the roof  against eaves and cornices  As to the  simile  too much stress must not be laid on it yet the epithet  nigra  speaks plainly in favour of the swallow whose back and wings are very black while the rump of the martin is milkwhite it's back and wings blue and all it's under part white as snow Nor can the clumsy motions comparatively clumsy of the martin well represent the sudden and artful evolutions and quick turns which  Juturna  gave to her brother's chariot so as to elude the eager pursuit of the enraged  Aeneas  The verb  sonat  also seems to imply a bird that is somewhat loquacious  "  Nigra  velut magnas domini cum divitis aedes  "Pervolat et pennis alta atria lustrat hirundo  "Pabula parva legens nidisque loquacibus escas  "Et nunc porticibus vacuis nunc humida circum  "Stagna  sonat  "    We have had a very wet autumn and winter so as to raise the springs to a pitch beyond any thing since which was a remarkable year for floods and high waters The landsprings which we call  lavants  break out much on the downs of  Sussex Hampshire  and  Wiltshire  The country people say when the  lavants  rise corn will always be dear meaning that when the earth is so glutted with water as to send forth springs on the downs and uplands that the cornvales must be drowned and so it has proved for these ten or eleven years past For landsprings have never obtained more since the memory of man than during that period nor has there been known a greater scarcity of all sorts of grain considering the great improvements of modern husbandry Such a run of wet seasons a century or two ago would I am persuaded have occasioned a famine Therefore pamphlets and newspaper letters that talk of combinations tend to inflame and mislead since we must not expect plenty till Providence sends us more favourable seasons  The wheat of last year all round this district and in the county of  Rutland  and elsewhere yields remarkably bad and our wheat on the ground by the continual late sudden vicissitudes from fierce frost to pouring rains looks poorly and the turnips rot very fast  I am c  LETTER XX TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Feb  DEAR SIR  THE sandmartin or bankmartin is by much the least of any of the  British hirundines  and as far as we have ever seen the smallest known hirundo though  Brisson  asserts that there is one much smaller and that is the  hirundo esculenta  But it is much to be regretted that it is scarce possible for any observer to be so full and exact as he could wish in reciting the circumstances attending the life and conversation of this little bird since it is  fera naturâ  at least in this part of the kingdom disclaiming all domestic attachments and haunting wild heaths and commons where there are large lakes while the other species especially the swallow and housemartin are remarkably gentle and domesticated and never seem to think themselves safe but under the protection of man  Here are in this parish in the sandpits and banks of the lakes of  Woolmerforest  several colonies of these birds and yet they are never seen in the village nor do they at all frequent the cottages that are scattered about in that wild district The only instance I ever remember where this species haunts any building is at the town of  Bishop's Waltham  in this county where many sandmartins nestle and breed in the scaffoldholes of the backwall of  William  of  Wykeham  's stables but then this wall stands in a very sequestered and  retired enclosure and faces upon a large and beautiful lake And indeed this species seems so to delight in large waters that no instance occurs of their abounding but near vast pools or rivers and in particular it has been remarked that they swarm in the banks of the  Thames  in some places below  Londonbridge  It is curious to observe with what different degrees of architectonic skill Providence has endowed birds of the same genus and so nearly correspondent in their general mode of life for while the swallow and the housemartin discover the greatest address in raising and securely fixing crusts or shells of loam as cunabula for their young the bankmartin terebrates a round and regular hole in the sand or earth which is serpentine horizontal and about two feet deep At the inner end of this burrow does this bird deposit in a good degree of safety her rude nest consisting of fine grasses and feathers usually goosefeathers very inartificially laid together  Perseverance will accomplish any thing though at first one would be disinclined to believe that this weak bird with her soft and tender bill and claws should ever be able to bore the stubborn sandbank without entirely disabling herself yet with these feeble instruments have I seen a pair of them make great dispatch and could remark how much they had scooped that day by the fresh sand which ran down the bank and was of a different colour from that which lay loose and bleached in the sun  In what space of time these little artists are able to mine and finish these cavities I have never been able to discover for reasons given above but it would be a matter worthy of observation where it falls in the way of any naturalist to make his remarks This I have often taken notice of that several holes of different depths are left unfinished at the end of summer To imagine that  these beginnings were intentionally made in order to be in the greater forwardness for next spring is allowing perhaps too much foresight and  rerum prudentia  to a simple bird May not the cause of these  latebrae  being left unfinished arise from their meeting in those places with strata too harsh hard and solid for their purpose which they relinquish and go to a fresh spot that works more freely Or may they not in other places fall in with a soil as much too loose and mouldering liable to flounder and threatening to overwhelm them and their labours  One thing is remarkablethat after some years the old holes are forsaken and new ones bored perhaps because the old habitations grow foul and fetid from long use or because they may so abound with fleas as to become untenantable This species of swallow moreover is strangely annoyed with fleas and we have seen fleas bedfleas  pulex irritans  swarming at the mouths of these holes like bees on the stools of their hives  The following circumstance should by no means be omittedthat these birds do  not  make use of their caverns by way of hybernacula as might be expected since banks so perforated have been dug out with care in the winter when nothing was found but empty nests  The sandmartin arrives much about the same time with the swallow and lays as she does from four to six white eggs But as this species is  cryptogame  carrying on the business of nidification incubation and the support of it's young in the dark it would not be so easy to ascertain the time of breeding were it not for the coming forth of the broods which appear much about the time or rather somewhat earlier than those of the swallow The nestlings are supported in common like those of their congeners with gnats and other small insects and sometimes they are fed with  libellulae  dragonflies almost as long as themselves In the last week in  June  we have seen a row of these sitting on a rail near a great pool as  perchers  and so young and helpless as easily to be taken by hand but whether the dams ever feed them on the wing as swallows and housemartins do we have never yet been able to determine nor do we know whether they pursue and attack birds of prey  When they happen to breed near hedges and enclosures they are dispossessed of their breeding holes by the housesparrow which is on the same account a fell adversary to housemartins  These  hirundines  are no songsters but rather mute making only a little harsh noise when a person approaches their nests They seem not to be of a sociable turn never with us congregating with their congeners in the autumn Undoubtedly they breed a second time like the housemartin and swallow and withdraw about  Michaelmas  Though in some particular districts they may happen to abound yet in the whole in the south of  England  at least is this much the rarest species For there are few towns or large villages but what abound with housemartins few churches towers or steeples but what are haunted by some swifts scarce a hamlet or single cottagechimney that has not it's swallow while the bankmartins scattered here and there live a sequestered life among some abrupt sandhills and in the banks of some few rivers  These birds have a peculiar manner of flying flitting about with odd jerks and vacillations not unlike the motions of a butterfly Doubtless the flight of all  hirundines  is influenced by and adapted to the peculiar sort of insects which furnish their food Hence it would be worth inquiry to examine what particular genus of insects affords the principal food of each respective species of swallow  Notwithstanding what has been advanced above some few sandmartins I see haunt the skirts of  London  frequenting the dirty pools in  Saint George'sFields  and about  WhiteChapel  The question is where these build since there are no banks or bold shores in that neighbourhood perhaps they nestle in the scaffold holes of some old or new deserted building They dip and wash as they fly sometimes like the housemartin and swallow  Sandmartins differ from their congeners in the diminutiveness of their size and in their colour which is what is usually called a mousecolour Near  Valencia  in  Spain  they are taken says  Willughby  and sold in the markets for the table and are called by the country people probably from their desultory jerking manner of flight  Papilion de Montagna  LETTER XXI TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Sept  DEAR SIR  AS the  swift  or  blackmartin  is the largest of the  British hirundines  so is it undoubtedly the latest comer For I remember but one instance of it's appearing before the last week in  April  and in some of our late frosty harsh springs it has not been seen till the begining of  May  This species usually arrives in pairs  The swift like the sandmartin is very defective in architecture making no crust or shell for it's nest but forming it of dry grasses and feathers very rudely and inartificially put together With all my attention to these birds I have never been able once to discover one in the act of collecting or carrying in materials so that I have suspected since their nests are exactly the same that they sometimes usurp upon the housesparrows and expel them as sparrows do the house and sandmartin well remembering that I have seen them squabbling together at the entrance of their holes and the sparrows up in arms and muchdisconcerted at these intruders And yet I am assured by a nice observer in such matters that they do collect feathers for their nests in  Andalusia  and that he has shot them with such materials in their mouths  Swifts like sandmartins carry on the business of nidification quite in the dark in crannies of castles and towers and steeples and upon the tops of the walls of churches under the roof and therefore cannot be so narrowly watched as those species that build more openly but from what I could ever observe they begin nesting about the middle of  May  and I have remarked from eggs taken that they have sat hard by the ninth of  June  In general they haunt tall buildings churches and steeples and breed only in such yet in this village some pairs frequent the lowest and meanest cottages and educate their young under those thatched roofs We remember but one instance where they breed out of buildings and that is in the sides of a deep chalkpit near the town of  Odiham  in this county where we have seen many pairs entering the crevices and skimming and squeaking round the precipices  As I have regarded these amusive birds with no small attention if I should advance something new and peculiar with respect to them and different from all other birds I might perhaps be credited  especially as my assertion is the result of many years exact observation The fact that I would advance is that swifts  tread  or copulate on the wing and I would wish any nice observer that is startled at this supposition to use his own eyes and I think he will soon be convinced In another  class  of animals  viz  the  insect  nothing is so common as to see the different species of many genera in conjunction as they fly The swift is almost continually on the wing and as it never settles on the ground on trees or roofs would seldom find opportunity for amorous rites was it not enabled to indulge them in the air If any person would watch these birds of a fine morning in  May  as they are sailing round at a great height from the ground he would see every now and then one drop on the back of another and both of them sink down together for many fathoms with a loud piercing shriek This I take to be the juncture when the business of generation is carrying on  As the swift eats drinks collects materials for it's nest and as it seems propagates on the wing it appears to live more in the air than any other bird and to perform all functions there save those of sleeping and incubation  This  hirundo  differs widely from it's congeners in laying invariably but  two  eggs at a time which are milkwhite long and peaked at the small end whereas the other species lay at each brood from  four  to  six  It is a most alert bird rising very early and retiring to roost very late and is on the wing in the height of summer at least sixteen hours In the longest days it does not withdraw to rest till a quarter before nine in the evening being the latest of all day birds Just before they retire whole groups of them assemble high in the air and squeak and shoot about with wonderful rapidity But this bird is never so much alive as in sultry thundry weather when it expresses great alacrity and calls  forth all it's powers In hot mornings several getting together in little parties dash round the steeples and churches squeaking as they go in a very clamorous manner these by nice observers are supposed to be males serenading their sitting hens and not without reason since they seldom squeak till they come close to the walls or eaves and since those within utter at the same time a little inward note of complacency  When the hen has sat hard all day she rushes forth just as it is almost dark and stretches and relieves her weary limbs and snatches a scanty meal for a few minutes and then returns to her duty of incubation Swifts when wantonly and cruelly shot while they have young discover a little lump of insects in their mouths which they pouch and hold under their tongue In general they feed in a much higher district than the other species a proof that gnats and other insects do also abound to a considerable height in the air they also range to vast distances since locomotion is no labour to them who are endowed with such wonderful powers of wing Their powers seem to be in proportion to their leavers and their wings are longer in proportion than those of almost any other bird When they mute or case themselves in flight they raise their wings and make them meet over their backs  At some certain times in the summer I had remarked that swifts were hawking very low for hours together over pools and streams and could not help inquiring into the object of their pursuit that induced them to descend so much below their usual range After some trouble I sound that they were taking  phryganeae ephemerae  and  libellulae  cadewflies mayflies and dragonflies that were just emerged out of their aurelia state I then no longer wondered that they should be so willing to stoop for a prey that afforded them such plentiful and succulent nourishment  They bring out their young about the middle or latter end of  July  but as these never become perchers nor that ever I could discern are fed on the wing by their dams the coming forth of the young is not so notorious as in the other species  On the thirtieth of last  June  I untiled the eaves of an house where many pairs build and found in each nest only  two  squab naked  pulli  on the eighth of  July  I repeated the same inquiry and found they had made very little progress towards a fledged state but were still naked and helpless From whence we may conclude that birds whose way of life keeps them perpetually on the wing would not be able to quit their nest till the end of the month Swallows and martins that have numerous families are continually feeding them every two or three minutes while swifts that have but two young to maintain are much at their leisure and do not attend on their nests for hours together  Sometimes they pursue and strike at hawks that come in their way but not with that vehemence and fury that swallows express on the same occasion They are out all day long in wet days feeding about and disregarding still rain from whence two things may be gathered first that many insects abide high in the air even in rain and next that the feathers of these birds must be well preened to resist so much wet Windy and particularly windy weather with heavy showers they dislike and on such days withdraw and are scarce ever seen  There is a circumstance respecting the  colour  of swifts which seems not to be unworthy our attention When they arrive in the spring they are all over of a glossy dark sootcolour except their chins which are white but by being all day long in the sun and air they become quite weatherbeaten and bleached before they depart and yet they return glossy again in the spring Now if  they pursue the sun into lower latitudes as some suppose in order to enjoy a perpetual summer why do they not return bleached Do they not rather perhaps retire to rest for a season and at that juncture moult and change their feathers since all other birds are known to moult soon after the season of breeding  Swifts are very anomalous in many particulars dissenting from all their congeners not only in the number of their young but in breeding but  once  in a summer whereas all the other  British hirundines  breed invariably  twice  It is past all doubt that swifts can breed but once since they withdraw in a short time after the flight of their young and some time before their congeners bring out their second broods We may here remark that as swifts breed but  once  in a summer and only  two  at a time and the other  hirundines twice  the latter who lay from four to six eggs increase at an average five times as fast as the former  But in nothing are swifts more singular than in their early retreat They retire as to the main body of them by the tenth of  August  and sometimes a few days sooner and every straggler invariably withdraws by the twentieth while their congeners all of them stay till the beginning of  October  many of them all through that month and some occasionally to the beginning of  November  This early retreat is mysterious and wonderful since that time is often the sweetest season in the year But what is more extraordinary they begin to retire still earlier in the most southerly parts of  Andalusia  where they can be no ways influenced by any defect of heat or as one might suppose defect of food Are they regulated in their motions with us by a failure of sood or by a propensity to moulting or by a disposition to rest after so rapid a life or by what This is one of those incidents in natural history that not only baffles our searches but almost eludes our guesses  These hirundines never perch on trees or roofs and so never congregate with their congeners They are fearless while haunting their nesting places and are not to be scared with a gun and are often beaten down with poles and cudgels as they stoop to go under the eaves Swifts are much infested with those pests to the genus called  hippoboscae hirundinis  and often wriggle and scratch themselves in their flight to get rid of that clinging annoyance  Swifts are no songsters and have only one harsh screaming note yet there are ears to which it is not displeasing from an agreeable association of ideas since that note never occurs but in the most lovely summer weather  They never settle on the ground but through accident and when down can hardly rise on account of the shortness of their legs and the length of their wings neither can they walk but only crawl but they have a strong grasp with their feet by which they cling to walls Their bodies being flat they can enter a very narrow crevice and where they cannot pass on their bellies they will turn up edgewise  The particular formation of the foot discriminates the swift from all the  British hirundines  and indeed from all other known birds the  hirundo melba  or great whitebellied swift of  Gibraltar  excepted for it is so disposed as to carry  "  omnes quatuor digitos anticos  "  all it's four toes forward besides the least toe which should be the backtoe consists of one bone alone and the other three only of two apiece A construction most rare and peculiar but nicely adapted to the purposes in which their feet are employed This and some peculiarities attending the nostrils and under mandible have induced a discerning  John Antony Scopoli of Carniola MD  naturalist to suppose that this  species  might constitute a  genus per se  In  London  a party of swifts frequents the  Tower  playing and feeding over the river just below the bridge others haunt some of the churches of the  Borough  next the fields but do not venture like the  housemartin  into the close crowded part of the town  The  Swedes  have bestowed a very pertinent name on this swallow calling it  ring swala  from the perpetual  rings  or circles that it takes round the scene of it's nidification  Swifts feed on  coleoptera  or small beetles with hard cases over their wings as well as on the softer insects but it does not appear how they can procure gravel to grind their food as swallows do since they never settle on the ground Young ones overrun with  hippoboscae  are sometimes found under their nests fallen to the ground the number of vermin rendering their abode insupportable any longer They frequent in this village several abject cottages yet a succession still haunts the same unlikely roofs a good proof this that the same birds return to the same spots As they must stoop very low to get up under these humble eaves cats lie in wait and sometimes catch them on the wing  On the fifth of  July  I again untiled part of a roof over the nest of a swift The dam sat in the nest but so strongly was she affected by natural  for her brood which she supposed to be in danger that regardless of her own safety she would not stir but lay sullenly by them permitting herself to be taken in hand The squab young we brought down and placed on the grassplot where they tumbled about and were as helpless as a newborn child While we contemplated their naked bodies their unwieldy disproportioned abdomina and their heads too heavy for their necks to support we could not but wonder when we reflected that these shiftless beings in a little more than a fortnight would be able to dash through the air almost with the  inconceivable swiftness of a meteor and perhaps in their emigration must traverse vast continents and oceans as distant as the equator So soon does Nature advance small birds to their  or state of perfection while the progressive growth of men and large quadrupeds is slow and tedious  I am c  LETTER XXII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Sept  DEAR SIR  BY means of a straight cottagechimney I had an opportunity this summer of remarking at my leisure how swallows ascend and descend through the shaft but my pleasure in contemplating the address with which this feat was performed to a considerable depth in the chimney was somewhat interrupted by apprehensions lest my eyes might undergo the same fate with those of  Tobit  Tobit  Perhaps it may be some amusement to you to hear at what times the different species of hirundines arrived this spring in three very distant counties of this kingdom With us the  swallow was seen first on  April  the th the swift on  April  the th the bankmartin on  April  the th and the housemartin not till  April  the th At  South Zele Devonshire  swallows did not arrive till  April  the th swifts in plenty on  May  the st and housemartins not till the middle of  May  At  Blackburn  in  Lancashire  swifts were seen  April  the th swallows  April  the th housemartins  May  the st Do these different dates in such distant districs prove any thing for or against migration  A farmer near  Weyhill  fallows his land with two teams of asses one of which works till noon and the other in the afternoon When these animals have done their work they are penned all night like sheep on the fallow In the winter they are confined and foddered in a yard and make plenty of dung  Linnaeus  says that hawks  "  paciscuntur inducias cum avibus quamdiu cuculus cuculat  "  but it appears to me that during that period many little birds are taken and destroyed by birds of prey as may be seen by their feathers left in lanes and under hedges  The  misselthrush  is while breeding fierce and pugnacious driving such birds as approach its nest with great fury to a distance The  Welch  call it  pen y llwyn  the head or master of the coppice He suffers no magpie jay or blackbird to enter the garden where he haunts and is for the time a good guard to the newsown legumens In general he is very successful in the defence of his family but once I observed in my garden that several magpies came determined to storm the nest of a misselthrush the dams defended their mansion with great vigour and fought resolutely  pro aris focis  but numbers at last prevailed they tore the nest to pieces and swallowed the young alive  In the season of nidification the wildest birds are comparatively tame Thus the  ringdove  breeds in my fields though they are continually frequented and the misselthrush though most shy and wild in the autumn and winter builds in my garden close to a walk where people are passing all day long  Wallfruit abounds with me this year but my grapes that used to be forward and good are at present backward beyond all precedent and this is not the worst of the story for the same ungenial weather the same black cold solstice has injured the more necessary fruits of the earth and discoloured and blighted our wheat The crop of hops promises to be very large  Frequent returns of deafness incommode me sadly and half disqualify me for a naturalist for when those fits are upon me I lose all the pleasing notices and little intimations arising from rural sounds and  May  is to me as silent and mute with respect to the notes of birds c as  August  My eyesight is thank God quick and good but with respect to the other sense I am at times disabled  "And Wisdom at one entrance quite shut out"  LETTER XXIII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  June  DEAR SIR  ON  September  the st being then on a visit and intent on fielddiversions I rose before daybreak when I came into the enclofures I found the stubbles and clovergrounds matted all over with a thick coat of cobweb in the meshes of which a copious and heavy dew hung so plentifully that the whole face of the country seemed as it were covered with two or three settingnets drawn one over another When the dogs attempted to hunt their eyes were so blinded and hoodwinked that they could not proceed but were obliged to lie down and scrape the incumbrances from their faces with their forefeet so that finding my sport interrupted I returned home musing in my mind on the oddness of the occurrence  As the morning advanced the sun became bright and warm and the day turned out one of those most lovely ones which no season but the autumn produces cloudless calm serene and worthy of the South of  France  itself  About nine an appearance very unusual began to demand our attention a shower of cobwebs falling from very elevated regions and continuing without any interruption till the close of the day These webs were not single filmy threads floating in the air in all directions but perfect flakes or rags some near an  inch broad and five or six long which fell with a degree of velocity that shewed they were considerably heavier than the atmosphere  On every side as the observer turned his eyes might he behold a continual succession of fresh flakes falling into his sight and twinkling like stars as they turned their sides towards the sun  How far this wonderful shower extended would be difficult to say but we know that it reached  Bradley Selborne  and  Alresford  three places which lie in a sort of a triangle the shortest of whose sides is about eight miles in extent  At the second of those places there was a gentleman for whose veracity and intelligent turn we have the greatest veneration who observed it the moment he got abroad but concluded that as soon as he came upon the hill above his house where he took his morning rides he should be higher than this meteor which he imagined might have been blown like  Thistledown  from the common above but to his great astonishment when he rode to the most elevated part of the down feet above his fields he found the webs in appearance still as much above him as before still descending into sight in a constant succession and twinkling in the sun so as to draw the attention of the most incurious  Neither before nor after was any such fall observed but on this day the flakes hung in the trees and hedges so thick that a diligent person sent out might have gathered baskets full  The remark that I shall make on these cobweblike appearances called  gossamer  is that strange and superstitious as the notions about them were formerly nobody in these days doubts but that they are the real production of small spiders which swarm in the fields in fine weather in autumn and have a power of shooting out webs from their tails so as to render themselves buoyant and  lighter than air But why these apterous insects should  that day  take such a wonderful aërial excursino and why their webs should at once become so gross and material as to be considerably more weighty than air and to descend with precipitation is a matter beyond my skill If I might be allowed to hazard a supposition I should imagine that those filmy threads when first shot might be entangled in the rising dew and so drawn up spiders and all by a brisk evaporation into the regions where clouds are formed and if the spiders have a power of coiling and thickening their webs in the air as Dr  Lister  says they have see his Letters to Mr  Ray  then when they were become heavier than the air they must fall  Every day in fine weather in autumn chiefly do I see those spiders shooting out their webs and mounting aloft they will go off from your finger if you will take them into your hand Last summer one alighted on my book as I was reading in the parlour and running to the top of the page and shooting out a web took it's departure from thence But what I most wondered at was that it went off with considerable velocity in a place where no air was stirring and I am sure that I did not assist it with my breath So that these little crawlers seem to have while mounting some locomotive power without the use of wings and to move in the air faster than the air itself  LETTER XXIV TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Aug  DEAR SIR  THERE is a wonderful spirit of sociality in the brute creation independent of sexual attachment the congregating of gregarious birds in the winter is a remarkable instance  Many horses though quiet with company will not stay one minute in a field by themselves the strongest fences cannot restrain them My neighbour's horse will not only not stay by himself abroad but he will not bear to be left alone in a strange stable without discovering the utmost impatience and endeavouring to break the rack and manger with his fore feet He has been known to leap out at a stablewindow through which dung was thrown after company and yet in other respects is remarkably quiet Oxen and cows will not fatten by themselves but will neglect the finest pasture that is not recommended by society It would be needless to instance in sheep which constantly flock together  But this propensity seems not to be confined to animals of the same species for we know a doe still alive that was brought up from a little sawn with a dairy of cows with them it goes afield and with them it returns to the yard The dogs of the house take no notice of this deer being used to her but if strange dogs come by a chase ensues while the master smiles to see his favourite securely leading her pursuers over hedge or  gate or stile till she returns to the cows who with fierce lowings and menacing horns drive the assailants quite out of the pasture  Even great disparity of kind and size does not always prevent social advances and mutual fellowship For a very intelligent and observant person has assured me that in the former part of his life keeping but one horse he happened also on a time to have but one solitary hen These two incongruous animals spent much of their time together in a lonely orchard where they saw no creature but each other By degrees an apparent regard began to take place between these two sequestered individuals The fowl would approach the quadruped with notes of complacency rubbing herself gently against his legs while the horse would look down with satisfaction and move with the greatest caution and circumspection lest he should trample on his dimunitive companion Thus by mutual good offices each seemed to console the vacant hours of the other so that  Milton  when he puts the following sentiment in the mouth of  Adam  seems to be somewhat mistaken  "Much less can  bird  with  beast  or fish with fowl  "So well converse nor with the ox the ape"  I am c  LETTER XXV TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Oct  DEAR SIR  WE have two gangs or hordes of gypsies which infest the south and west of  England  and come round in their circuit two or three times in the year One of these tribes calls itself by the noble name of  Stanley  of which I have nothing particular to say but the other is distinguished by an appellative somewhat remarkableAs far as their harsh gibberish can be understood they seem to say that the name of their clan is  Curleople  now the termination of this word is apparently  Grecian  and as  Mezeray  and the gravest historians all agree that these vagrants did certainly migrate from  Egypt  and the East two or three centuries ago and so spread by degrees over  Europe  may not this familyname a little corrupted be the very name they brought with them from the  Levant  It would be matter of some curiosity could one meet with an intelligent person among them to inquire whether in their jargon they still retain any  Greek  words the  Greek  radicals will appear in hand foot head water earth c It is possible that amidst their cant and corrupted dialect many mutilated remains of their native language might still be discovered  With regard to those peculiar people the gypsies one thing is very remarkable and especially as they came from warmer climates and that is that while other beggars lodge in barns  stables and cowhouses these sturdy savages seem to pride themselves in braving the severities of winter and in living  sub dio  the whole year round Last  September  was as wet a month as ever was known and yet during those deluges did a young gypsygirl liein in the midst of one of our hopgardens on the cold ground with nothing over her but a piece of a blanket extended on a few hazelrods bent hoop fashion and stuck into the earth at each end in circumstances too trying for a cow in the same condition yet within this garden there was a large hopkiln into the chambers of which she might have retired had she thought shelter an object worthy her attention  Europe  itself it seems cannot set bounds to the rovings of these vagabonds for Mr  Bell  in his return from  Peking  met a gang of these people on the confines of  Tartary  who were endeavouring to penetrate those deserts and try their fortune in  China  See Bell's Travels in China    Gypsies are called in  French Bohemiens  in  Italian  and modern  Greek Zingani  I am c  LETTER XXVI TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Nov  DEAR SIR  "Hîctaedae pingues hîc plurimus ignis  "Semper et assiduâ postes fuligine nigri"  I SHALL make no apology for troubling you with the detail of a very simple piece of domestic oeconomy being satisfied that you think nothing beneath your attention that tends to utility the matter alluded to is the use of  rushes  instead of candles which I am well aware prevails in many districts besides this but as I know there are countries also where it does not obtain and as I have considered the subject with some degree of exactness I shall proceed in my humble story and leave you to judge of the expediency  The proper species of  rush  for this purpose seems to be the  juncus effusus  or common soft rush which is to be found in most moist pastures by the sides of streams and under hedges These rushes are in best condition in the height of summer but may be gathered so as to serve the purpose well quite on to autumn It would be needless to add that the largest and longest are best Decayed labourers women and children make it their business to procure and prepare them As soon as they are cut they must be flung into water and kept there for otherwise they will dry and shrink and the peel will not run At first a person would  find it no easy matter to divest a rush of it's peel or rind so as to leave one regular narrow even rib from top to bottom that may support the pith but this like other feats soon becomes familiar even to children and we have seen an old woman stoneblind performing this business with great dispatch and seldom failing to strip them with the nicest regularity When these  junci  are thus far prepared they must lie out on the grass to be bleached and take the dew for some nights and afterwards be dried in the sun  Some address is required in dipping these rushes in the scalding fat or grease but this knack also is to be attained by practice The careful wife of an industrious  Hampshire  labourer obtains all her fat for nothing for she saves the scummings of her baconpot for this use and if the grease abounds with salt she causes the salt to precipitate to the bottom by setting the scummings in a warm oven Where hogs are not much in use and especially by the seaside the coarser animaloils will come very cheap A pound of common grease may be procured for four pence and about six pounds of grease will dip a pound of rushes and one pound of rushes may be bought for one shilling so that a pound of rushes medicated and ready for use will cost three shillings If men that keep bees will mix a little wax with the grease it will give it a consistency and render it more cleanly and make the rushes burn longer muttonsuet would have the same effect  A good rush which measured in length two feet four inches and an half being minuted burnt only three minutes short of an hour and a rush still of greater length has been known to burn one hour and a quarter  These rushes give a good clear light Watchlights coated with tallow it is true shed a dismal one  "darkness visible"  but  then the wick of those have  two  ribs of the rind or peel to support the pith while the wick of the dipped rush has but  one  The  two  ribs are intended to impede the progress of the flame and make the candle last  In a pound of dry rushes avoirdupois which I caused to be weighed and numbered we found upwards of one thousand six hundred individuals Now suppose each of these burns one with another only half an hour then a poor man will purchase eight hundred hours of light a time exceeding thirtythree entire days for three shillings According to this account each rush before dipping costs of a farthing and afterwards Thus a poor family will enjoy ½ hours of comfortable light for a farthing An experienced old housekeeper assures me that one pound and an half of rushes completely supplies his family the year round since working people burn no candle in the long days because they rise and go to bed by daylight  Little farmers use rushes much in the short days both morning and evening in the dairy and kitchen but the very poor who are always the worst oeconomists and therefore must continue very poor buy an halfpenny candle every evening which in their blowing open rooms does not burn much more than two hours Thus have they only two hours light for their money instead of eleven  While on the subject of rural oeconomy it may not be improper to mention a pretty implement of housewifery that we have seen no where else that is little neat besoms which our foresters make from the stalks of the  polytricum commune  or  great golden maidenhair  which they call  silkwood  and find plenty in the bogs When this moss is well combed and dressed and divested of it's outer skin it becomes of a beautiful brightchesnut colour and being  soft and pliant is very proper for the dusting of beds curtains carpets hangings c If these besoms were known to the brushmakers in town it is probable they might come much in use for the purpose abovementioned  A besom of this sort is to be seen in Sir  Ashton Lever  's Museum    I am c  LETTER XXVII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Dec  DEAR SIR  WE had in this village more than twenty years ago an idiot boy whom I well remember who from a child shewed a strong propensity to bees they were his food his amusement his sole object And as people of this cast have seldom more than one point in view so this lad exerted all his few faculties on this one pursuit In the winter he dosed away his time within his father's house by the fire side in a kind of torpid state seldom departing from the chimneycorner but in the summer he was all alert and in quest of his game in the fields and on sunny banks Honeybees humblebees and wasps were his prey wherever he found them he had no apprehensions from their stings but would seize  seize them  nudis manibus  and at once disarm them of their weapons and suck their bodies for the sake of their honeybags Sometimes he would fill his bosom between his shirt and his skin with a number of these captives and sometimes would confine them in bottles He was a very  merops apiaster  or  beebird  and very injurious to men that kept bees for he would slide into their beegardens and sitting down before the stools would rap with his finger on the hives and so take the bees as they came out He has been known to overturn hives for the sake of honey of which he was passionately fond Where metheglin was making he would linger round the tubs and vessels begging a draught of what he called  beewine  As he ran about he used to make a humming noise with his lips resembling the buzzing of bees This lad was lean and sallow and of a cadaverous complexion and except in his favourite pursuit in which he was wonderfully adroit discovered no manner of understanding Had his capacity been better and directed to the same object he had perhaps abated much of our wonder at the feats of a more modern exhibiter of bees and we may justly say of him now  " Thou  "Had thy presiding star propitious shone  "Should'st  Wildman  be "  When a tall youth he was removed from hence to a distant village where he died as I understand before he arrived at manhood  I am c  LETTER XXVIII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Jan  DEAR SIR  IT is the hardest thing in the world to shake off superstitious prejudices they are sucked in as it were with our mother's milk and growing up with us at a time when they take the fastest hold and make the most lasting impressions become so interwoven into our very constitutions that the strongest good sense is required to disengage ourselves from them No wonder therefore that the lower people retain them their whole lives through since their minds are not invigorated by a liberal education and therefore not enabled to make any efforts adequate to the occasion  Such a preamble seems to be necessary before we enter on the superstitions of this district lest we should be suspected of exaggeration in a recital of practices too gross for this enlightened age  But the people of  Tring  in  Hertfordshire  would do well to remember that no longer ago than the year and within twenty miles of the capital they seized on two superannuated wretches crazed with age and overwhelmed with infirmities on a suspicion of witchcraft and by trying experiments drowned them in a horsepond  In a farmyard near the middle of this village stands at this day a row of pollardashes which by the seams and long cicatrices down their sides manifestly shew that in former times they have been cleft asunder These trees when young and flexible were severed and held open by wedges while ruptured children stripped  naked were pushed through the apertures under a persuasion that by such a process the poor babes would be cured of their infirmity As soon as the operation was over the tree in the suffering part was plastered with loam and carefully swathed up If the parts coalesced and soldered together as usually fell out where the feat was performed with any adroitness at all the party was cured but where the cleft continued to gape the operation it was supposed would prove ineffectual Having occasion to enlarge my garden not long since I cut down two or three such trees one of which did not grow together  We have several persons now living in the village who in their childhood were supposed to be healed by this superstitious ceremony derived down perhaps from our  Saxon  ancestors who practised it before their conversion to Christianity  At the south corner of the  Plestor  or area near the church there stood about twentyyears ago a very old grotesque hollow pollardash which for ages had been looked on with no small veneration as a  shrewash  Now a shrewash is an ash whose twigs or branches when gently applied to the limbs of cattle will immediately relieve the pains which a beast suffers from the running of a  shrewmouse  over the part affected for it is supposed that a shrewmouse is of so baneful and deleterious a nature that wherever it creeps over a beast be it horse cow or sheep the suffering animal is afflicted with cruel anguish and threatened with the loss of the use of the limb Against this accident to which they were continually liable our provident forefathers always kept a shrewash at hand which when once medicated would maintain it's virtue for ever A shrewash was made thus  For a similar practice see  Plot's Staffordshire  Into the body of the  tree a deep hole was bored with an auger and a poor devoted shrewmouse was thrust in alive and plugged in no doubt with several quaint incantations long since forgotten As the ceremonies necessary for such a consecration are no longer understood all succession is at an end and no such tree is known to subsist in the manor or hundred  As to that on the  Plestor  "The late vicar stubb'd and burnt it"  when he was waywarden regardless of the remonstrances of the bystanders who interceded in vain for it's preservation urging it's power and efficacy and alledging that it had been  "Religione patrum multos servata per annos"  I am c  LETTER XXIX TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Feb  DEAR SIR  IN heavy fogs on elevated situations especially trees are perfect alembics and no one that has not attended to such matters can imagine how much water one tree will distil in a night's time by condensing the vapour which trickles down the twigs and boughs so as to make the ground below quite in a float In  Newtonlane  in  October  on a misty day a particular oak in leaf dropped so fast that the cartway stood in puddles and the ruts ran with water though the ground in general was dusty  In some of our smaller islands in the  WestIndies  if I mistake not there are no springs or rivers but the people are supplied with that necessary element water merely by the dripping of some large tall trees which standing in the bosom of a mountain keep their heads constantly enveloped with fogs and clouds from which they dispense their kindly neverceasing moisture and so render those districts habitable by condensation alone  Trees in leaf have such a vast proportion more of surface than those that are naked that in theory their condensations should greatly exceeed those that are stripped of their leaves but as the former  imbibe  also a great quantity of moisture it is difficult to say which drip most but this I know that deciduous trees that are entwined with much ivy seem to distil the greatest quantity Ivyleaves are smooth and thick and cold and therefore condense very fast and besides evergreens imbibe very little These facts may furnish the intelligent with hints concerning what sorts of trees they should plant round small ponds that they would wish to be perennial and shew them how advantageous some trees are in preference to others  Trees perspire profusely condense largely and check evaporation so much that woods are always moist no wonder therefore that they contribute much to pools and streams  That trees are great promoters of lakes and rivers appears from a well known fact in  NorthAmerica  for since the woods and forests have been grubbed and cleared all bodies of water are much diminished so that some streams that were very considerable a  century ago will not now drive a common mill  Vide  Kalm  's Travels to  NorthAmerica  Besides most woodlands forests and chases with us abound with pools and morasses no doubt for the reason given above  To a thinking mind few phenomena are more strange than the state of little ponds on the summits of chalkhills many of which are never dry in the most trying droughts of summer On  chalkhills  I say because in many rocky and gravelly soils springs usually break out pretty high on the sides of elevated grounds and mountains but no person acquainted with chalky districts will allow that they ever saw springs in such a soil but in vallies and bottoms since the waters of so pervious a stratum as chalk all lie on one dead level as welldiggers have assured me again and again  Now we have many such little round ponds in this district and one in particular on our sheepdown three hundred feet above my house which though never above three feet deep in the middle and not more than thirty feet in diameter and containing perhaps not more than two or three hundred hogsheads of water yet never is known to fail though it affords drink for three hundred or four hundred sheep and for at least twenty head of large cattle beside This pond it is true is overhung with two moderate beeches that doubtless at times afford it much supply but then we have others as small that without the aid of trees and in spite of evaporation from sun and wind and perpetual consumption by cattle yet constantly maintain a moderate share of water without overflowing in the wettest seasons as they would do if supplied by springs By my journal of  May  it appears that  "the small and even considerable ponds in the vales are now dried up while the small ponds on the very tops of hills are but little affected"  Can this difference be accounted for from evaporation alone which certainly is more prevalent in bottoms or rather have not those  elevated pools some unnoticed recruits which in the night time counterbalance the waste of the day without which the cattle alone must soon exhaust them And here it will be necessary to enter more minutely into the cause Dr  Hales  in his Vegetable Statics advances from experiment that  "the moister the earth is the more dew falls on it in a night and more than a  double  quantity of dew falls on a surface of  water  than there does on an equal surface of moist earth"  Hence we see that water by it's coolness is enabled to assimilate to itself a large quantity of moisture nightly by condensation and that the air when loaded with fogs and vapours and even with copious dews can alone advance a considerable and neverfailing resource Persons that are much abroad and travel early and late such as shepherds fishermen c can tell what prodigious fogs prevail in the night on elevated downs even in the hottest parts of summer and how much the surfaces of things are drenched by those swimming vapours though to the senses all the while little moisture seems to fall  I am c  LETTER XXX TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  April  DEAR SIR  MONSIEUR HERISSANT a  French  anatomist seems persuaded that he has discovered the reason why cuckoos do not hatch their own eggs the impediment he supposes arises from the internal structure of their parts which incapacitates them for incubation According to this gentleman the crop or craw of a cuckoo does not lie before the sternum at the bottom of the neck as in the  gallinae columbae  c but immediately behind it on and over the bowels so as to make a large protuberance in the belly  Histoire de l'Academie Royale      Induced by this assertion we procured a cuckoo and cutting open the breastbone and exposing the intestines to sight found the crop lying as mentioned above This stomach was large and round and stuffed hard like a pincushion with food which upon nice examination we found to consist of various insects such as small scarabs spiders and dragonflies the last of which we have seen cuckoos catching on the wing as they were just emerging out of the aurelia state Among this farrago also were to be seen maggots and many seeds which belonged either to gooseberries currants cranberries or some such fruit so that these birds apparently  subsist on insects and fruits nor was there the least appearance of bones feathers or fur to support the idle notion of their being birds of prey  The sternum in this bird seemed to us to be remarkably short between which and the anus lay the crop or craw and immediately behind that the bowels against the backbone  It must be allowed as this anatomist observes that the crop placed just upon the bowels must especially when full be in a very uneasy situation during the business of incubation yet the test will be to examine whether birds that are actually known to sit for certain are not formed in a similar manner This inquiry I proposed to myself to make with a  fernowl  or goatsucker as soon as opportunity offered because if their formation proves the same the reason for incapacity in the cuckoo will be allowed to have been taken up somewhat hastily  Not long after a fernowl was procured which from it's habit and shape we suspected might resemble the cuckoo in it's internal construction Nor were our suspicions illgrounded for upon the dissection the crop or craw also lay behind the sternum immediately on the viscera between them and the skin of the belly It was bulky and stuffed hard with large  phalaenae  moths of several sorts and their eggs which no doubt had been forced out of those insects by the action of swallowing  Now as it appears that this bird which is so well known to practise incubation is formed in a similar manner with cuckoos Monsieur  Herissant  's conjecture that cuckoos are incapable of incubation from the disposition of their intestines seems to fall to the ground and we are still at a loss for the cause of that strange and singular peculiarity in the instance of the  cuculus canorus  We found the case to be the same with the ringtail hawk in respect to formation and as far as I can recollect with the swift and probably it is so with many more sorts of birds that are not granivorous  I am c  LETTER XXXI TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  April  DEAR SIR  ON  August  the th we surprised a large viper which seemed very heavy and bloated as it lay in the grass basking in the sun When we came to cut it up we found that the abdomen was crowded with young fifteen in number the shortest of which measured full seven inches and were about the size of fullgrown earthworms This little fry issued into the world with the true viperspirit about them shewing great alertness as soon as disengaged from the belly of the dam they twisted and wriggled about and set themselves up and gaped very wide when touched with a stick shewing manifest tokens of menace and defiance though as yet they had no manner of fangs that we could find even with the help of our glasses  To a thinking mind nothing is more wonderful than that early instinct which impresses young animals with the notion of the situation of their natural weapons and of using them properly in their own defence even before those weapons subsist or are formed Thus a young cock will spar at his adversary before his spurs are grown and a calf or a lamb will push with their heads before their horns are sprouted In the same manner did these young adders attempt to bite before their fangs were in being The dam however was furnished with very formidable ones which we lifted up for they fold down when not used and cut them off with the point of our scissars  There was little room to suppose that this brood had ever been in the open air before and that they were taken in for refuge at the mouth of the dam when she perceived that danger was approaching because then probably we should have found them somewhere in the neck and not in the abdomen  LETTER XXXII TO THE SAME  CASTRATION has a strange effect it emasculates both man beast and bird and brings them to a near resemblance of the other sex Thus eunuchs have smooth unmuscular arms thighs and legs and broad hips and beardless chins and squeaking voices Geltstags and bucks have hornless heads like hinds and does Thus wethers have small horns like ewes and oxen large bent horns and hoarse voices when they low like cows for bulls have short straight horns and though they mutter and grumble in a deep tremendous tone yet they low in a shrill high key Capons have small combs and gills and look pallid about the head like pullets they also walk without any parade and hover chickens like hens Barrowhogs have also small tusks like sows  Thus far it is plain that the deprivation of  masculine vigour  puts a stop to the growth of those parts or appendages that are looked upon as it's insignia But the ingenious Mr  Lisle  in his book on husbandry carries it much farther for he says that the loss of those insignia alone has sometimes a strange effect on the ability itself he had a boar so fierce and venereous that to prevent mischief orders were given for his tusks to be broken off No sooner had the beast suffered this injury than his powers forsook him and he neglected those females to whom before he was passionately attached and from whom no fences could restrain him  LETTER XXXIII TO THE SAME  THE natural term of an hog's life is little known and the reason is plainbecause it is neither profitable nor convenient to keep that turbulent animal to the full extent of it's time however my neighbour a man of substance who had no occasion to study every little advantage to a nicety kept an half bred Bantamsow who was as thick as she was long and whose belly swept on the ground till she was advanced to her seventeenth year at which period she shewed some tokens of age by the decay of her teeth and the decline of her fertility  For about ten years this prolific mother produced two litters in the year of about ten at a time and once above twenty at a litter but as there were near double the number of pigs to that of teats many died From long experience in the world this female was grown very sagacious and artfulwhen she found occasion to converse with a boar she used to open all the intervening gates and march by herself up to a distant farm where one was kept and when her purpose was served would return by the same means At the age of about fifteen her litters began to be reduced to four or five and such a litter she exhibited when in her sattingpen She proved when fat good bacon juicy and tender the rind or sward was remarkably thin At a moderate computation she  was allowed to have been the fruitful parent of three hundred pigs a prodigious instance of fecundity in so large a quadruped She was killed in spring  I am c  LETTER XXXIV TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  May  DEAR SIR  " admorunt ubera tigres"  WE have remarked in a former letter how much incongruous animals in a lonely state may be attached to each other from a spirit of sociality in this it may not be amiss to recount a different motive which has been known to create as strange a fondness  My friend had a little helpless  leveret  brought to him which the servants fed with milk in a spoon and about the same time his cat kittened and the young were dispatched and buried The hare was soon lost and supposed to be gone the way of most fondlings to be killed by some dog or cat However in about a fortnight as the master was sitting in his garden in the dusk of the evening he observed his cat with tail erect trotting towards him and calling with little short inward notes of complacency  such as they use towards their kittens and something gamboling after which proved to be the leveret that the cat had supported with her milk and continued to support with great affection  Thus was a graminivorous animal nurtured by a carnivorous and predaceous one  Why so cruel and sanguinary a beast as a cat of the ferocious genus of  Feles  the  murium leo  as  Linnaeus  calls it should be affected with any tenderness towards an animal which is it's natural prey is not so easy to determine  This strange affection probably was occasioned by that desiderium those tender maternal feelings which the loss of her kittens had awakened in her breast and by the complacency and ease she derived to herself from the procuring her teats to be drawn which were too much distended with milk till from habit she became as much delighted with this foundling as if it had been her real offspring  This incident is no bad solution of that strange circumstance which grave historians as well as the poets assert of exposed children being sometimes nurtured by female wild beasts that probably had lost their young For it is not one whit more marvellous that  Romulus  and  Remus  in their infant state should be nursed by a shewolf than that a poor little sucking leveret should be fostered and cherished by a bloody grimalkin  "viridi foetam Mavortis in antro  "Procubuisse lupam geminos huic ubera circum  "Ludere pendentes pueros et lambere matrem

and probably the reason may be because the worms are drowned The most insignificant insects and reptiles are of much more consequence and have much more influence in the oeconomy of Nature than the incurious are aware of and are mighty in their effect from their minuteness which renders them less an object of attention and from their numbers and fecundity Earthworms though in appearance a small and despicable link in the chain of Nature yet if lost would make a lamentable chasm For to say nothing of half the birds and some quadrupeds which are almost entirely supported by them worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation which would proceed but lamely without them by boring perforating and loosening the soil and rendering it pervious to rains and the fibres of plants by drawing straws and stalks of leaves and twigs into it and most of all by throwing up such infinite numbers of lumps of earth called wormcasts which being their excrement is a fine manure for grain and grass Worms probably provide new soil for hills and slopes where the rain washes the earth away and they affect slopes probably to avoid being flooded Gardeners and farmers express their detestation of worms the former because they render their walks unsightly and make them much work and the latter because as they think worms eat their  green corn But these men would find that the earth without worms would soon become cold hardbound and void of fermentation and consequently steril and besides in favour of worms it should be hinted that green corn plants and flowers are not so much injured by them as by many species of  coleoptera  scarabs and  tipulae  longlegs in their larva or grubstate and by unnoticed myriads of small shellless snails called slugs which silently and imperceptibly make amazing havoc in the field and garden  Farmer  Young  of  Nortonfarm  says that this spring about four acres of his wheat in one field was entirely destroyed by  slugs  which swarmed on the blades of corn and devoured it as fast as it sprang    These hints we think proper to throw out in order to set the inquisitive and discerning to work  A good monography of worms would afford much entertainment and information at the same time and would open a large and new field in natural history Worms work most in the spring but by no means lie torpid in the dead months are out every mild night in the winter as any person may be convinced that will take the pains to examine his grassplots with a candle are hermaphrodites and much addicted to venery and consequently very prolific  I am c  LETTER XXXVI TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Nov  DEAR SIR  YOU cannot but remember that the twentysixth and twentyseventh of last  March  were very hot days so fultry that every body complained and were restless under those sensations to which they had not been reconciled by gradual approaches  This sudden summerlike heat was attended by many summer coincidences for on those two days the thermometer rose to sixtysix in the shade many species of insects revived and came forth some bees swarmed in this neighbourhood the old tortoise near  Lewes  in  Sussex  awakened and came forth out of it's dormitory and what is most to my present purpose many  houseswallows  appeared and were very alert in many places and particularly at  Cobham  in  Surrey  But as that short warm period was succeeded as well as preceded by harsh severe weather with frequent frosts and ice and cutting winds the insects withdrew the tortoise retired again into the ground and the swallows were seen no more until the tenth of  April  when the rigour of the spring abating a softer season began to prevail  Again it appears by my journals for many years past that  housemartins  retire to a bird about the beginning of  October  so that a person not very observant of such matters would conclude that they  had taken their last farewell but then it may be seen in my diaries also that considerable flocks have discovered themselves again in the first week of  November  and often on the fourth day of that month only  for one day  and that not as if they were in actual migration but playing about at their leisure and feeding calmly as if no enterprize of moment at all agitated their spirits And this was the case in the beginning of this very month for on the fourth of  November  more than twenty housemartins which in appearance had all departed about the seventh of  October  were seen again for that  one morning only  sporting between my fields and  the Hanger  and feasting on insects which swarmed in that sheltered district The preceding day was wet and blustering but the fourth was dark and mild and soft the wind at southwest and the thermometer at ½ a pitch not common at that season of the year Moreover it may no the amiss to add in this place that whenever the thermometer is above the bat comes flitting out in every autumnal and wintermonth  From all these circumstances laid together it is obvious that torpid insects reptiles and quadrupeds are awakened from their profoundest slumbers by a little untimely warmth and therefore that nothing so much promotes this deathlike stupor as a defect of heat And farther it is reasonable to suppose that two whole species or at least many individuals of those two species of  British hirundines  do never leave this island at all but partake of the same benumbed state for we cannot suppose that after a month's absence housemartins can return from southern regions to appear for  one  morning in  November  or that houseswallows should leave the districts of  Africa  to enjoy in  March  the transient summer of a  couple  of days  I am c  LETTER XXXVII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Jan  DEAR SIR  THERE was in this village several years ago a miserable pauper who from his birth was afflicted with a leprosy as far as we are aware of a singular kind since it affected only the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet This scaly eruption usually broke out twice in the year at the spring and fall and by peeling away left the skin so thin and tender that neither his hands or feet were able to perform their functions so that the poor object was half his time on crutches incapable of employ and languishing in a tiresome state of indolence and inactivity His habit was lean lank and cadaverous In this sad plight he dragged on a miserable existence a burden to himself and his parish which was obliged to support him till he was relieved by death at more than thirty years of age  The good women who love to account for every defect in children by the doctrine of longing said that his mother felt a violent propensity for oysters which she was unable to gratify and that the black rough scurf on his hands and feet were the shells of that fish We knew his parents neither of which were lepers his father in particular lived to be far advanced in years  In all ages the leprosy has made dreadful havock among mankind The  Israelites  seem to have been greatly afflicted with it  from the most remote times as appears from the peculiar and repeated injunctions given them in the  Levitical  law  See Leviticus chap xiii and xiv  Nor was the rancour of this foul disorder much abated in the last period of their commonwealth as may be seen in many passages of the New Testament  Some centuries ago this horrible distemper prevailed all  Europe  over and our forefathers were by no means exempt as appears by the large provision made for objects labouring under this calamity There was an hospital for female lepers in the diocese of  Lincoln  a noble one near  Durham  three in  London  and  Southwark  and perhaps many more in or near our great towns and cities Moreover some crowned heads and other wealthy and charitable personages bequeathed large legacies to such poor people as languished under this hopeless infirmity  It must therefore in these days be to an humane and thinking person a matter of equal wonder and satisfaction when he contemplates how nearly this pest is eradicated and observes that a leper now is a rare sight He will moreover when engaged in such a train of thought naturally inquire for the reason This happy change perhaps may have originated and been continued from the much smaller quantity of salted meat and fish now eaten in these kingdoms from the use of linen next the skin from the plenty of better bread and from the profusion of fruits roots legumes and greens so common in every family Three or four centuries ago before there were any enclosures sowngrasses fieldturnips or fieldcarrots or hay all the cattle which had grown fat in summer and were not killed for winteruse were turned out soon after  Michaelmas  to shift as they could through the  dead months so that no fresh meat could be had in winter or spring Hence the marvellous account of the vast stores of salted flesh found in the larder of the eldest  Spencer  Viz  Six hundred bacons eighty carcasses of beef and six hundred muttons  in the days of  Edward  the Second even so late in the spring as the third of  May  It was from magazines like these that the turbulent barons supported in idleness their riotous swarms of retainers ready for any disorder or mischief But agriculture is now arrived at such a pitch of perfection that our best and fattest meats are killed in the winter and no man need eat salted flesh unless he prefers it that has money to buy fresh  One cause of this distemper might be no doubt the quantity of wretched fresh and salt fish consumed by the commonalty at all seasons as well as in lent which our poor now would hardly be persuaded to touch  The use of linen changes shirts or shifts in the room of sordid and filthy woollen long worn next the skin is a matter of neatness comparatively modern but must prove a great means of preventing cutaneous ails At this very time woollen instead of linen prevails among the poorer  Welch  who are subject to foul eruptions  The plenty of good wheaten bread that now is found among all ranks of people in the south instead of that miserable sort which used in old days to be made of barley or beans may contribute not a little to the sweetening their blood and correcting their juices for the inhabitants of mountainous districts to this day are still liable to the itch and other cutaneous disorders from a wretchedness and poverty of diet  As to the produce of a garden every middleaged person of observation may perceive within his own memory both in town  and country how vastly the consumption of vegetables is increased Greenstalls in cities now support multitudes in a comfortable state while gardeners get fortunes Every decent labourer also has his garden which is half his support as well as his delight and common farmers provide plenty of beans peas and greens for their hinds to eat with their bacon and those few that do not are despised for their sordid parsimony and looked upon as regardless of the welfare of their dependants Potatoes have prevailed in this little district by means of premiums within these twenty years only and are much esteemed here now by the poor who would scarce have ventured to taste them in the last reign  Our  Saxon  ancestors certainly had some sort of cabbage because they call the month of  February sproutcale  but long after their days the cultivation of gardens was little attended to The religious being men of leisure and keeping up a constant correspondence with  Italy  were the first people among us that had gardens and fruittrees in any perfection within the walls of their abbies  "In  monasteries  the lamp of knowledge continued to burn however dimly In them men of business were formed for the state the art of writing was cultivated by the  monks  they were the only proficients in mechanics  gardening  and architecture"  See  Dalrymple  's Annals of  Scotland  and priories The  barons  neglected every pursuit that did not lead to war or tend to the pleasure of the chase  It was not till gentlemen took up the study of horticulture themselves that the knowledge of gardening made such hasty advances Lord  Cobham  Lord  Ila  and Mr  Waller  of  Beaconsfield  were some of the first people of rank that promoted the elegant science of ornamenting without despising the superintendence of the kitchen quarters and fruit walls  A remark made by the excellent Mr  Ray  in his Tour of  Europe  at once surprises us and corroborates what has been advanced above for we find him observing so late as his days that  "the  Italians  use several herbs for sallets which  are not yet  or have not been but  lately  used in  England  viz  selleri  celery which is nothing else but the sweet smallage the young shoots whereof with a little of the head of the root cut off they eat raw with oil and pepper"  and farther he adds  "  curled endive  blanched is much used beyond seas and for a raw sallet seemed to excel lettuce itself"  Now this journey was undertaken no longer ago than in the year  I am c  LETTER XXXVIII TO THE SAME  "Fortè puer comitum seductus ab agmine fido  "Dixerat ecquis adest et adest responderat echo  "Hic stupet utque aciem partes divisit in omnes  "Voce veni clamat magnâ Vocat illa vocantem"  SELBORNE  Feb  DEAR SIR  IN a district so diversified as this so full of hollow vales and hanging woods it is no wonder that echoes should abound Many we have discovered that return the cry of a pack of dogs the notes of a huntinghorn a tunable ring of bells or the melody of birds very agreeably but we were still at a loss for a polysyllabical  articulate echo till a young gentleman who had parted from his company in a summer evening walk and was calling after them stumbled upon a very curious one in a spot where it might least be expected At first he was much surprised and could not be persuaded but that he was mocked by some boy but repeating his trials in several languages and finding his respondent to be a very adroit polyglot he then discerned the deception  This echo in an evening before rural noises cease would repeat ten syllables most articulately and distinctly especially if quick dactyls were chosen The last syllables of  "Tityre tu patulae recubans "  were as audibly and intelligibly returned as the first and there is no doubt could trial have been made but that at midnight when the air is very elastic and a dead stillness prevails one or two syllables more might have been obtained but the distance rendered so late an experiment very inconvenient  Quick dactyls we observed succeeded best for when we came to try it's powers in slow heavy embarassed spondees of the same number of syllables  "Monstrum horrendum informe ingens "  we could perceive a return but of four or five  All echoes have some one place to which they are returned stronger and more distinct than to any other and that is always the place that lies at right angles with the object of repercussion and is not too near nor too far off Buildings or naked rocks reecho much more articulately than hanging wood or vales because in the latter the voice is as it were entangled and embarassed in the covert and weakened in the rebound  The true object of this echo as we found by various experiments is the stonebuilt tiled hopkiln in  Gallylane  which measures in front feet and from the ground to the eaves feet The true  centrum phonicum  or just distance is one particular spot in the  King'sfield  in the path to  Norehill  on the very brink of the steep balk above the hollow cart way In this case there is no choice of distance but the path by meer contingency happens to be the lucky the identical spot because the ground rises or falls so immediately if the speaker either retires or advances that his mouth would at once be above or below the object  We measured this polysyllabical echo with great exactness and found the distance to fall very short of Dr  Plot  's rule for distinct articulation for the Doctor in his history of  Oxfordshire  allows feet for the return of each syllable distinctly hence this echo which gives ten distinct syllables ought to measure yards or feet to each syllable whereas our distance is only yards or near feet to each syllable Thus our measure falls short of the Doctor's as five to eight but then it must be acknowledged that this candid philosopher was convinced afterwards that some latitude must be admitted of in the distance of echoes according to time and place  When experiments of this sort are making it should always be remembered that weather and the time of day have a vast influence on an echo for a dull heavy moist air deadens and clogs the sound and hot sunshine renders the air thin and weak and deprives it of all it's springiness and a ruffling wind quite defeats the whole In a still clear dewy evening the air is most elastic and perhaps the later the hour the more so  Echo has always been so amusing to the imagination that the poets have personified her and in their hands she has been the occasion of many a beautiful fiction Nor need the gravest man be ashamed to appear taken with such a phaenomenon since it may become the subject of philosophical or mathematical inquiries  One should have imagined that echoes if not entertaining must at least have been harmless and inoffensive yet  Virgil  advances a strange notion that they are injurious to bees After enumerating some probable and reasonable annoyances such as prudent owners would wish far removed from their beegardens he adds  " aut ubi concava pulsu  "Saxa sonant vocisque offensa resultat imago"  This wild and fanciful assertion will hardly be admitted by the philosophers of these days especially as they all now seem agreed that insects are not furnished with any organs of hearing at all But if it should be urged that though they cannot  hear  yet perhaps they may  feel  the repercussions of sounds I grant it is possible they may Yet that these impressions are distasteful or hurtful I deny because bees in good summers thrive well in my outlet where the echoes are very strong for this village is another  Anathoth  a place of  responses  or  echoes  Besides it does not appear from experiment that bees are in any way capable of being affected by sounds for I have often tried my own with a large speakingtrumpet held close to their hives and with such an exertion of voice as would have haled a ship at the distance of a mile and still these insects pursued their various employments undisturbed and without shewing the least sensibility or resentment  Some time since it's discovery this echo is become totally silent though the object or hopkiln remains nor is there any mystery in this defect for the field between is planted as an hopgarden and the voice of the speaker is totally absorbed and lost among the poles and entangled foliage of the hops And when the poles are removed in autumn the disappointment is the same because a tall quickset hedge nurtered up for the purpose of shelter to the hop ground entirely interrupts the impulse and repercussion of the voice so that till those obstructions are removed no more of it's garrulity can be expected  Should any gentleman of fortune think an echo in his park or outlet a pleasing incident he might  build  one at little or no expense For whenever he had occasion for a new barn stable dogkennel or the like structure it would be only needful to erect this building on the gentle declivity of an hill with a like rising opposite to it at a few hundred yards distance and perhaps success might be the easier ensured could some canal lake or stream intervene From a seat at the  centrum phonicum  he and his friends might amuse themselves sometimes of an evening with the prattle of this loquacious nymph of whose complacency and decent reserve more may be said than can with truth of every individual of her sex since she is  " quae nec  reticere  loquenti  "Nec  prior  ipsa  loqui  didicit resonabilis echo"  I am c  PS The classic reader will I trust pardon the following lovely quotation so finely describing echoes and so poetically accounting for their causes from popular superstition  "Quae benè quom videas rationem reddere possis  "Tute tibi atque aliis quo pacto per loca sola  "Saxa pareis formas verborum ex ordine

attending those amusing birds the  swifts  I am now confirmed in the opinion that we have every year the same number of pairs invariably at least the result of my inquiry has been exactly the same for a long time past The swallows and martins are so numerous and so widely distributed over the village that it is hardly possible to recount them while the swifts though they do not all build in the church yet so frequently haunt it and play and rendezvous round it that they are easily enumerated The number that I constantly find are  eight pairs  about half of which reside in the church and the rest build in some of the lowest and meanest thatched cottages Now as these eight pairs allowance being made for accidents breed yearly eight pairs more what becomes annually of this increase and what determines every spring which pairs shall visit us and reoccupy their ancient haunts  Ever since I have attended to the subject of ornithology I have always supposed that that sudden reverse of affection that strange  which immediately succeeds in the feathered kind to the most passionate fondness is the occasion of an equal dispersion of birds over the face of the earth Without this provision one favourite district would be crowded with inhabitants while others  would be destitute and forsaken But the parent birds seem to maintain a jealous superiority and to oblige the young to seek for new abodes and the rivalry of the males in many kinds prevents their crowding the one on the other Whether the swallows and housemartins return in the same exact number annually is not easy to say for reasons given above but it is apparent as I have remarked before in my Monographies that the numbers returning bear no manner of proportion to the numbers retiring  LETTER XL TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  June  DEAR SIR  THE standing objection to botany has always been that it is a pursuit that amuses the fancy and exercises the memory without improving the mind or advancing any real knowledge and where the science is carried no farther than a mere systematic classification the charge is but too true But the botanist that is desirous of wiping off this aspersion should be by no means content with a list of names he should study plants philosophically should investigate the laws of vegetation should examine the powers and virtues of efficacious herbs should promote their  cultivation and graft the gardener the planter and the husbandman on the phytologist Not that system is by any means to be thrown aside without system the field of Nature would be a pathless wilderness but system should be subservient to not the main object of pursuit  Vegetation is highly worthy of our attention and in itself is of the utmost consequence to mankind and productive of many of the greatest comforts and elegancies of life To plants we owe timber bread beer honey wine oil linen cotton c what not only strengthens our hearts and exhilerates our spirits but what secures us from inclemencies of weather and adorns our persons Man in his true state of nature seems to be subsisted by spontaneous vegetation in middle climes where grasses prevail he mixes some animal food with the produce of the field and garden and it is towards the polar extremes only that like his kindred bears and wolves he gorges himself with flesh alone and is driven to what hunger has never been known to compel the very beasts to prey on his own species  See the late Voyages to the southseas  The productions of vegetation have had a vast influence on the commerce of nations and have been the great promoters of navigation as may be seen in the articles of sugar tea tobacco opium ginseng betel paper c As every climate has it's peculiar produce our natural wants bring on a mutual intercourse so that by means of trade each distant part is supplied with the growth of every latitude But without the knowledge of plants and their culture we must have been content with our hips and haws without enjoying the delicate fruits of  India  and the salutiferous drugs of  Peru  Instead of examining the minute distinctions of every various species of each obscure genus the botanist should endeavour to make himself acquainted with those that are useful You shall see a man readily ascertain every herb of the field yet hardly know wheat from barley or at least one sort of wheat or barley from another  But of all sorts of vegetation the  grasses  seem to be most neglected neither the farmer nor the grazier seem to distinguish the annual from the perennial the hardy from the tender nor the succulent and nutritive from the dry and juiceless  The study of grasses would be of great consequence to a northerly and grazing kingdom The botanist that could improve the swerd of the district where he lived would be an useful member of society to raise a thick turf on a naked soil would be worth volumes of systematic knowledge and he would be the best commonwealth's man that could occasion

verâ incessu patuit "  Thus  kites  and  buzzards  sail round in circles with wings expanded and motionless and it is from their gliding manner that the former are still called in the north of  England gleads  from the  Saxon  verb  glidan  to glide The  kestrel  or  windhover  has a peculiar mode of hanging in the air in one place his wings all the while being briskly agitated  Henharriers  sly low over heaths or fields of corn and beat the ground regularly like a pointer or settingdog  Owls  move in a buoyant manner as if lighter than the air they seem to want ballast There is a peculiarity belonging to  ravens  that must draw the attention even of the most incuriousthey spend all  their leisure time in striking and cuffing each other on the wing in a kind of playful skirmish and when they move from one place to another frequently turn on their backs with a loud croak and seem to be falling to the ground When this odd gesture betides them they are scratching themselves with one foot and thus lose the center of gravity  Rooks  sometimes dive and tumble in a frolicksome manner  crows  and  daws  swagger in their walk  woodpeckers  sly  volatu undoso  opening and closing their wings at every stroke and so are always rising or falling in curves All of this genus use their tails which incline downward as a support while they run up trees  Parrots  like all other hookedclawed birds walk aukwardly and make use of their bill as a third foot climbing and descending with ridiculous caution All the  gallinae  parade and walk gracefully and run nimbly but fly with difficulty with an impetuous whirring and in a straight line  Magpies  and  jays  flutter with powerless wings and make no dispatch  herons  seem incumbered with too much sail for their light bodies but these vast hollow wings are necessary in carrying burdens such as large fishes and the like  pigeons  and particularly the sort called  smiters  have a way of clashing their wings the one against the other over their backs with a loud snap another variety called  tumblers  turn themselves over in the air Some birds have movements peculiar to the season of love thus  ringdoves  though strong and rapid at other times yet in the spring hang about on the wing in a toying and playful manner thus the  cocksnipe  while breeding forgetting his former flight fans the air like the windhover and the  greenfinch  in particular exhibits such languishing and faultering gestures as to appear like a wounded and dying bird the  kingfisher  darts along like an arrow  fernowls  or  goatsuckers  glance in the dusk over the tops of trees like a meteor  starlings  as it were swim along while  misselthrushes  use a wild and desultory flight  swallows  sweep over the surface of the ground and water and distinguish themselves by rapid turns and quick evolutions  swifts  dash round in circles and the  bankmartin  moves with frequent vacillations like a butterfly Most of the small birds fly by jerks rising and falling as they advance Most small birds hop but  wagtails  and  larks  walk moving their legs alternately  Skylarks  rise and fall perpendicularly as they sing  woodlarks  hang poised in the air and  titlarks  rise and fall in large curves singing in their descent The  whitethroat  uses odd jerks and gesticulations over the tops of hedges and bushes All the  duckkind  waddle  divers  and  auks  walk as if fettered and stand erect on their tails these are the  compedes  of  Linnaeus Geese  and  cranes  and most wildfowls move in figured flights often changing their position The secondary  remiges  of  Tringae wildducks  and some others are very long and give their wings when in motion an hooked appearance  Dabchicks moorhens  and  coots  fly erect with their legs hanging down and hardly make any dispatch the reason is plain their wings are placed too forward out of the true center of gravity as the legs of  auks  and  divers  are situated too backward  LETTER XLIII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Sept  DEAR SIR  FROM the motion of birds the transition is natural enough to their notes and language of which I shall say something Not that I would pretend to understand their language like the  vizier  who by the recital of a conversation which passed between two owls reclaimed a sultan  See Spectator Vol VII N  o    before delighting in conquest and devastation but I would be thought only to mean that many of the winded tribes have various sounds and voices adapted to express their various passions wants and feelings such as anger fear love hatred hunger and the like All species are not equally eloquent some are copious and fluent as it were in their utterance while others are confined to a few important sounds no bird like the fish kind is quite mute though some are rather silent The language of birds is very ancient and like other ancient modes of speech very elliptical little is said but much is meant and understood  The notes of the eaglekind are shrill and piercing and about the season of nidification much diversified as I have been often assured by a curious observer of Nature who long resided at  Gibraltar  where eagles abound The notes of our  hawks  much resemble those of the king of birds  Owls  have very expressive notes they hoot in a fine vocal sound much resembling the  vox  Lumana  and reducible by a pitchpipe to a musical key This note seems to express complacency and rivalry among the males they use also a quick call and an horrible scream and can snore and hiss when they mean to menace  Ravens  besides their loud croak can exert a deep and solemn note that makes the woods to echo the amorous sound of a  crow  is strange and ridiculous  rooks  in the breeding season attempt sometimes in the gaiety of their hearts to sing but with no great success the  parrot  kind have many modulations of voice as appears by their aptitude to learn human sounds  doves  coo in an amorous and mournful manner and are emblems of despairing lovers the  woodpecker  sets up a sort of loud and hearty laugh the  fernowl  or  goatsucker  from the dusk till daybreak serenades his mate with the clattering of castanets All the tuneful  passeres  express their complacency by sweet modulations and a variety of melody The  swallow  as has been observed in a former letter by a shrill alarm bespeaks the attention of the other  hirundines  and bids them be aware that the hawk is at hand Aquatic and gregarious birds especially the nocturnal that shift their quarters in the dark are very noisy and loquacious as cranes wildgeese wildducks and the like their perpetual clamour prevents them from dispersing and losing their companions  In so extensive a subject sketches and outlines are as much as can be expected for it would be endless to instance in all the infinite variety of the feathered nation We shall therefore confine the remainder of this letter to the few domestic fowls of our yards which are most known and therefore best understood And first the  peacock  with his gorgeous train demands our attention but like most of the gaudy birds his notes are grating and shocking to the car the yelling of cats and the braying of an ass are not  more disgustful The voice of the  goose  is trumpetlike and clanking and once saved the Capitol at  Rome  as grave historians assert the hiss also of the  gander  is formidable and full of menace and  "protective of his young"  Among  ducks  the sexual distinction of voice is remarkable for while the  quack  of the female is loud and sonorous the voice of the  drake  is inward and harsh and feeble and scarce discernible The cock  turkey  struts and gobbles to his mistress in a most uncouth manner he hath also a pert and petulant note when he attacks his adversary When a hen  turkey  leads forth her young brood she keeps a watchful eye and if a bird of prey appear though ever so high in the air the careful mother announces the enemy with a little inward moan and watches him with a steady and attentive look but if he approach her note becomes earnest and alarming and her outcries are redoubled  No inhabitants of a yard seem possessed of such a variety of expression and so copious a language as common poultry Take a chicken of four or five days old and hold it up to a window where there are flies and it will immediately seize it's prey with little twitterings of complacency but if you tender it a wasp or a bee at once it's note becomes harsh and expressive of disapprobation and a sense of danger When a pullet is ready to lay she intimates the event by a joyous and easy soft note Of all the occurrences of their life that of  laying  seems to be the most important for no sooner has a hen disburdened herself than she rushes forth with a clamorous kind of joy which the cock and the rest of his mistresses immediately adopt The tumult is not confined to the family concerned but catches from yard to yard and spreads to every homestead within hearing till at last the whole village is in an uproar As soon as a hen becomes a mother  her new relation demands a new language she then runs clocking and screaming about and seems agitated as if possessed The father of the flock has also a considerable vocabulary if he finds food he calls a favourite concubine to partake and if a bird of prey passes over with a warning voice he bids his family beware The gallant  chanticleer  has at command his amorous phrases and his terms of defiance But the sound by which he is best known is his  crowing  by this he has been distinguished in all ages as the countryman's clock or larum as the watchman that proclaims the divisions of the night Thus the poet elegantly styles him  " the crested cock whose clarion sounds  "The silent hours"  A neighbouring gentleman one summer had lost most of his chickens by a sparrowhawk that came gliding down between a faggot pile and the end of his house to the place where the coops stood The owner inwardly vexed to see his flock thus diminishing hung a setting net adroitly between the pile and the house into which the caitif dashed and was entangled Resentment suggested the law of retaliation he therefore clipped the hawk's wings cut off his talons and fixing a cork on his bill threw him down among the broodhens Imagination cannot paint the scene that ensued the expressions that fear rage and revenge inspired were new or at least such as had been unnoticed before the exasperated matrons upbraided they execrated they insulted they triumphed In a word they never desisted from buffering their adversary till they had torn him in an hundred pieces  LETTER XLIV TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  " monstrent"  " "  "Quid tantùm Oceano properent se tingere soles"  "Hyberni vel quae tardis mora noctibus obstet"  GENTLEMEN who have outlets might contrive to make ornament subservient to utility a pleasing eyetrap might also contribute to promote science an obelisk in a garden or park might be both an embellishment and an  heliotrope  Any person that is curious and enjoys the advantage of a good horizon might with little trouble make two  heliotropes  the one for the  winter  the other for the  summer  solstice and these two erections might be constructed with very little expense for two pieces of timber framework about ten or twelve feet high and four feet broad at the base and close lined with plank would answer the purpose  The erection for the former should if possible be placed within sight of some window in the common sitting parlour because men at that dead season of the year are usually within doors at the close of the day while that for the latter might be fixed for any given spot in the garden or outlet whence the owner might contemplate in a fine summer's evening the utmost extent that the sun makes to the  northward  at the season of the longest  days Now nothing would be necessary but to place these two  objects  with so much exactness that the  westerly  limb of the sun at setting might but just clear the  winter heliotrope  to the  west  of it on the  shortest  day and that the  whole  disc of the sun at the  longest  day might exactly at setting also clear the  summer heliotrope  to the  north  of it  By this simple expedient it would soon appear that there is no such thing strictly speaking as a solstice for from the  shortest  day the owner would every clear evening see the disc  advancing  at it's setting to the  westward  of the object and from the  longest  day observe the sun  retiring  backwards every evening at it's seting towards the object  westward  till in a few nights it would set quite behind it and so by degrees to the  west  of it for when the sun comes near the summer solstice the whole disc of it would at first set behind the object after a time the  northern  limb would first appear and so every night gradually more till at length the whole diameter would set  northward  of it for about three nights but on the middle night of the three sensibly more remote than the former or following When beginning it's recess from the summer tropic it would continue more and more to be hidden every night till at length it would descend quite behind the object again and so nightly more and more to the  westward  LETTER XLV TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  " Mugire videbis  "Sub pedibus terram et descendere montibus ornos"  WHEN I was a boy I used to read with astonishment and implicit assent accounts in  Baker's Chronicle  of walking hills and travelling mountains  John Philips  in his  Cyder  alludes to the credit that was given to such stories with a delicate but quaint vein of humour peculiar to the author of the  Splendid Shilling  "I nor advise nor reprehend the choice  "Of  Marcley Hill  the apple no where finds  "A kinder mould yet 'tis unsafe to trust  "Deceitful ground who knows but that once more  "This mount may journey and his present site  "Forsaken to thy neighbour's bounds transfer  "Thy goodly plants affording matter strange  "For law debates"  But when I came to consider better I began to suspect that though our hills may never have journeyed far yet that the ends of many of them have slipped and fallen away at distant periods leaving the cliffs bare and abrupt This seems to have been the case with  Nore  and  Whetham Hills  and especially with the ridge between  Harteley Park  and  Wordleham  where the ground has slid into vast swellings and furrows and lies still in such romantic  confusion as cannot be accounted for from any other cause A strange event that happened not long since justifies our suspicions which though it befell not within the limits of this parish yet as it was within the hundred of  Selborne  and as the circumstances were singular may fairly claim a place in a work of this nature  The months of  January  and  February  in the year were remarkable for great melting snows and vast gluts of rain so that by the end of the latter month the landsprings or  lavants  began to prevail and to be near as high as in the memorable winter of The beginning of  March  also went on in the same tenor when in the night between the th and th of that month a considerable part of the great woody hanger at  Hawkley  was torn from it's place and fell down leaving a high freestone cliff naked and bare and resembling the steep side of a chalkpit It appears that this huge fragment being perhaps sapped and undermined by waters foundered and was ingulfed going down in a perpendicular direction for a gate which stood in the field on the top of the hill after sinking with it's posts for thirty or forty feet remained in so true and upright a position as to open and shut with great exactness just as in it's first situation Several oaks also are still standing and in a state of vegetation after taking the same desperate leap That great part of this prodigious mass was absorbed in some gulf below is plain also from the inclining ground at the bottom of the hill which is free and unincumbered but would have been buried in heaps of rubbish had the fragment parted and fallen forward About an hundred yards from the foot of this hanging coppice stood a cottage by the side of a lane and two hundred yards lower on the other side of the lane was a farmhouse in which lived a labourer and  his family and just by a stout new barn The cottage was inhabited by an old woman and her son and his wife These people in the evening which was very dark and tempestuous observed that the brick floors of their kitchens began to heave and part and that the walls seemed to open and the roofs to crack but they all agree that no tremor of the ground indicating an earthquake was ever felt only that the wind continued to make a most tremendous roaring in the woods and hangers The miserable inhabitants not daring to go to bed remained in the utmost solicitude and confusion expecting every moment to be buried under the ruins of their shattered edifices When daylight came they were at leisure to contemplate the devastations of the night they then found that a deep rift or chasm had opened under their houses and torn them as it were in two and that one end of the barn had suffered in a similar manner that a pond near the cottage had undergone a strange reverse becoming deep at the shallow end and so  vice versa  that many large oaks were removed out of their perpendicular some thrown down and some fallen into the heads of neighbouring trees and that a gate was thrust forward with it's hedge full six feet so as to require a new track to be made to it From the foot of the cliff the general course of the ground which is pasture inclines in a moderate descent for half a mile and is interspersed with some hillocks which were rifted in every direction as well towards the great woody hanger as from it In the first pasture the deep clefts began and running across the lane and under the buildings made such vast shelves that the road was impassable for some time and so over to an arable field on the other side which was strangely torn and disordered The second pasture field being more soft and springy was protruded forward without many fissures in the turf which  was raised in long ridges resembling graves lying at right angles to the motion At the bottom of this enclosure the soil and turf rose many feet against the bodies of some oaks that obstructed their farther course and terminated this awful commotion  The perpendicular height of the precipice in general is twentythree yards the length of the lapse or slip as seen from the fields below one hundred and eightyone and a partial fall concealed in the coppice extends seventy yards more so that the total length of this fragment that fell was two hundred and fiftyone yards About fifty acres of land suffered from this violent convulsion two houses were entirely destroyed one end of a new barn was left in ruins the walls being cracked through the very stones that composed them a hanging coppice was changed to a naked rock and some grass grounds and an arable field so broken and rifted by the chasms as to be rendered for a time neither fit for the plough or safe for pasturage till considerable labour and expense had been bestowed in levelling the surface and filling in the gaping fissures  LETTER XLVI TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  " resonant arbusta "  THERE is a steep abrupt pasture field interspersed with furze close to the back of this village well known by the name of the  Short Lirhe  consisting of a rocky dry soil and inclining to the afternoon sun This spot abounds with the  gryllus campestris  or  fieldcricket  which though frequent in these parts is by no means a common insect in many other counties  As their cheerful summer cry cannot but draw the attention of a naturalist I have often gone down to examine the oeconomy of these  grylli  and study their mode of life but they are so shy and cautious that it is no easy matter to get a sight of them for feeling a person's footsteps as he advances they stop short in the midst of their song and retire backward nimbly into their burrows where they lurk till all suspicion of danger is over  At first we attempted to dig them out with a spade but without any great success for either we could not get to the bottom of the hole which often terminated under a great stone or else in breaking up the ground we inadvertently squeezed the poor insect to death Out of one so bruised we took a multitude of eggs  which were long and narrow of a yellow colour and covered with a very tough skin By this accident we learned to distinguish the male from the female the former of which is shining black with a golden stripe across his shoulders the latter is more dusky more capacious about the abdomen and carries a long swordshaped weapon at her tail which probably is the instrument with which she deposits her eggs in crannies and safe receptacles  Where violent methods will not avail more gentle means will often succeed and so it proved in the present case for though a spade be too boisterous and rough an implement a pliant stalk of grass gently insinuated into the caverns will probe their windings to the bottom and quickly bring out the inhabitant and thus the humane inquirer may gratify his curiosity without injuring the object of it It is remarkable that though these insects are furnished with long legs behind and brawny thighs for leaping like grasshoppers yet when driven from their holes they shew no activity but crawl along in a shiftless manner so as easily to be taken and again though provided with a curious apparatus of wings yet they never exert them when there seems to be the greatest occasion The males only make that shrilling noise perhaps out of rivalry and emulation as is the case with many animals which exert some sprightly note during their breeding time it is raised by a brisk friction of one wing against the other They are solitary beings living singly male or female each as it may happen but there must be a time when the sexes have some intercourse and then the wings may be useful perhaps during the hours of night When the males meet they will sight siercely as I found by some which I put into the crevices of a dry stone wall where I should have been glad to have made them settle For though they seemed distressed by being taken out of their knowledge  yet the first that got possession of the chinks would seize on any that were obtruded upon them with a vast row of serrated fangs With their strong jaws toothed like the shears of a lobster's claws they perforate and round their curious regular cells having no foreclaws to dig like the molecricket When taken in hand I could not but wonder that they never offered to defend themselves though armed with such formidable weapons Of such herbs as grow before the mouths of their burrows they eat indiscriminately and on a little platform which they make just by they drop their dung and never in the day time seem to stir more than two or three inches from home Sitting in the entrance of their caverns they chirp all night as well as day from the middle of the month of  May  to the middle of  July  and in hot weather when they are most vigorous they make the hills echo and in the stiller hours of darkness may be heard to a considerable distance In the beginning of the season their notes are more faint and inward but become louder as the summer advances and so die away again by degrees  Sounds do not always give us pleasure according to their sweetness and melody nor do harsh sounds always displease We are more apt to be captivated or disgusted with the associations which they promote than with the notes themselves Thus the shrilling of the  fieldcricket  though sharp and stridulous yet marvellously delights some hearers filling their minds with a train of summer ideas of every thing that is rural verdurous and joyous  About the tenth of  March  the crickets appear at the mouths of their cells which they then open and bore and shape very elegantly All that ever I have seen at that season were in their pupa state and had only the rudiments of wings lying under a skin or  coat which must be cast before the insect can arrive at it's perfect state  We have observed that they cast these skins in  April  which are then seen lying at the mouths of their holes  from whence I should suppose that the old ones of last year do not always survive the winter In  August  their holes begin to be obliterated and the insects are seen no more till spring  Not many summers ago I endeavoured to transplant a colony to the terrace in my garden by boring deep holes in the sloping turf The new inhabitants stayed some time and fed and sung but wandered away by degrees and were heard at a farther distance every morning so that it appears that on this emergency they made use of their wings in attempting to return to the spot from which they were taken  One of these crickets when confined in a paper cage and set in the sun and supplied with plants moistened with water will feed and thrive and become so merry and loud as to be irksome in the same room where a person is sitting if the plants are not wetted it will die  LETTER XLVII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  DEAR SIR  "Far from all resort of mirth  "Save the cricket on the hearth"  MILTON's  Il Penseroso  WHILE many other insects must be sought after in fields and woods and waters the  gryllus domesticus  or  housecricket  resides altogether within our dwellings intruding itself upon our notice whether we will or no This species delights in newbuilt houses being like the spider pleased with the moisture of the walls and besides the softness of the mortar enables them to burrow and mine between the joints of the bricks or stones and to open communications from one room to another They are particularly fond of kitchens and bakers' ovens on account of their perpetual warmth  Tender insects that live abroad either enjoy only the short period of one summer or else doze away the cold uncomfortable months in profound slumbers but these residing as it were in a torrid zone are always alert and merry a good  Christmas  fire is to them like the heats of the dogdays Though they are frequently heard by day yet is their natural time of motion only in the night As soon as it grows dusk the chirping increases and they come running forth and are from the size of a flea to that of their full stature As one should suppose from the  burning atmosphere which they inhabit they are a thirsty race and shew a great propensity for liquids being found frequently drowned in pans of water milk broth or the like Whatever is moist they affect and therefore often gnaw holes in wet woollen stockings and aprons that are hung to the fire they are the housewife's barometer foretelling her when it will rain and are prognostic sometimes she thinks of ill or good luck of the death of a near relation or the approach of an absent lover By being the constant companions of her solitary hours they naturally become the objects of her superstition These crickets are not only very thirsty but very voracious for they will eat the scummings of pots and yeast salt and crumbs of bread and any kitchen offal or sweepings In the summer we have observed them to fly when it became dusk out of the windows and over the neighbouring roofs This feat of activity accounts for the sudden manner in which they often leave their haunts as it does for the method by which they come to houses where they were not known before It is remarkable that many sorts of insects seem never to use their wings but when they have a mind to shift their quarters and settle new colonies When in the air they move  "  volatu undoso  "  in waves or curves like  woodpeckers  opening and shutting their wings at every stroke and so are always rising or sinking  When they increase to a great degree as they did once in the house where I am now writing they become noisome pests slying into the candles and dashing into people's faces but may be blasted and destroyed by gunpowder discharged into their crevices and crannies In families at such times they are like Pharaoh's plague of frogs  "in their bedchambers and upon their beds and in their ovens and in their kneadingtroughs  Exod viii  "  Their shrilling noise is occasioned by a brisk attrition of their wings Cats catch hearthcrickets and playing with them as they do with mice devour them Crickets may be destroyed like wasps by phials half filled with beer or any liquid and set in their haunts for being always eager to drink they will crowd in till the bottles are full  LETTER XLVIII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  HOW diversified are the modes of life not only of incongruous but even of congenerous animals and yet their specific distinctions are not more various than their propensities Thus while the  fieldcricket  delights in sunny dry banks and the  housecricket  rejoices amidst the glowing heat of the kitchen hearth or oven the  gryllus gryllo talpa  the  molecricket  haunts moist meadows and frequents the sides of ponds and banks of streams performing all it's functions in a swampy wet soil With a pair of forefeet curiously adapted to the purpose it burrows and works under ground like the mole raising a ridge as it proceeds but seldom throwing up hillocks  As  molecrickets  often infest gardens by the sides of canals they are unwelcome guests to the gardener raising up ridges in their subterraneous progress and rendering the walks unsightly If they take to the kitchen quarters they occasion great damage among the plants and roots by destroying whole beds of cabbages young legumes and flowers When dug out they seem very slow and helpless and make no use of their wings by day but at night they come abroad and make long excursions as I have been convinced by finding stragglers in a morning in improbable places In fine weather about the middle of  April  and just at the close of day they begin to solace themselves with a low dull jarring note continued for a long time without interruption and not unlike the chattering of the fernowl or goatsucker but more inward  About the beginning of  May  they lay their eggs as I was once an eyewitness for a gardener at an house where I was on a visit happening to be mowing on the th of that month by the side of a canal his scythe struck too deep pared off a large piece of turf and laid open to view a curious scene of domestic oeconomy  " ingentem lato dedit ore fenestram  "Apparet domus intus et atria longa patescunt  "Apparent penetralia"  There were many caverns and winding passages leading to a kind of chamber neatly smoothed and rounded and about the size of a moderate snuffbox Within this secret nursery were deposited near an hundred eggs of a dirty yellow colour and enveloped in a tough skin but too lately excluded to contain any rudiments of young being full of a viscous substance The eggs  lay but shallow and within the influence of the sun just under a little heap of freshmowed mould like that which is raised by ants  When  molecrickets  fly they move  "  cursu undoso  "  rising and falling in curves like the other species mentioned before In different parts of this kingdom people call them  fencrickets churrworms  and  evechurrs  all very apposite names  Anatomists who have examined the intestines of these insects astonish me with their accounts for they say that from the structure position and number of their stomachs or maws there seems to be good reason to suppose that this and the two former species  ruminate  or  chew  the  cud  like many quadrupeds  LETTER XLIX TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  May  IT is now more than forty years that I have paid some attention to the ornithology of this district without being able to exhaust the subject new occurrences still arise as long as any inquiries are kept alive  In the last week of last month five of those most rare birds too uncommon to have obtained an  English  name but known to naturalists  depiction of a plover  Pa  CHARADRIUS Himantopus  by the terms of  himantopus  or  loripes  and  charadrius himantopus  were shot upon the verge of  Frinshampond  a large lake belonging to the Bishop of  Winchester  and lying between  Woolmerforest  and the town of  Farnham  in the county of  Surrey  The pond keeper says there were three brace in the slock but that after he had satisfied his curiosity he suffered the sixth to remain unmolested One of these specimens I procured and found the length of the legs to be so extraordinary that at first sight one might have supposed the shanks had been fastened on to impose on the credulity of the beholder they were legs in  caricatura  and had we seen such proportions on a  Chinese  or  Japan  screen we should have made large allowances for the fancy of the draughtsman These birds are of the  plover  family and might with propriety be called the  stilt plovers Brisson  under that idea gives them the apposite name of  l'echasse  My specimen when drawn and stuffed with pepper weighed only four ounces and a quarter though the  naked  part of the thigh measured three inches and an half and the legs four inches and an half Hence we may safely assert that these birds exhibit weight for inches incomparably the greatest length of legs of any known bird The  flamingo  for instance is one of the most long legged birds and yet it bears no manner of proportion to the  himantopus  for a cock  flamingo  weighs at an average about four pounds avoirdupois and his legs and thighs measure usually about twenty inches But four pounds are fifteen times and a fraction more than four ounces and one quarter and if four ounces and a quarter have eight inches of legs four pounds must have one hundred and twenty inches and a fraction of legs  viz  somewhat more than ten feet such a monstrous proportion as the world never saw If you should try the experiment in still larger birds the disparity would still increase It must be matter of great  curiosity to see the  stilt plover  move to observe how it can wield such a length of lever with such feeble muscles as the thighs seem to be furnished with At best one should expect it to be but a bad walker but what adds to the wonder is that it has no back toe Now without that steady prop to support it's steps it must be liable in speculation to perpetual vacillations and seldom able to preserve the true center of gravity  The old name of  himantopus  is taken from  Pliny  and by an aukward metaphor implies that the legs are as slender and pliant as if cut out of a  thong  of leather Neither  Willughby  nor  Ray  in all their curious researches either at home or abroad ever saw this bird Mr  Pennant  never met with it in all  GreatBritain  but observed it often in the cabinets of the curious at  Paris Hasselquist  says that it migrates to  Egypt  in the autumn and a most accurate observer of Nature has assured me that he has found it on the banks of the streams in  Andalusia  Our writers record it to have been found only twice in  GreatBritain  From all these relations it plainly appears that these long legged  plovers  are birds of  South Europe  and rarely visit our island and when they do are wanderers and stragglers and impelled to make so distant and northern an excursion from motives or accidents for which we are not able to account One thing may fairly be deduced that these birds come over to us from the continent since nobody can suppose that a species not noticed once in an age and of such a remarkable make can constantly breed unobserved in this kingdom  LETTER L TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  April  DEAR SIR  THE old  Sussex  tortoise that I have mentioned to you so often is become my property I dug it out of it's winter dormitory in  March  last when it was enough awakened to express it's resentments by hissing and packing it in a box with earth carried it eighty miles in postchaises The rattle and hurry of the journey so perfectly roused it that when I turned it out on a border it walked twice down to the bottom of my garden however in the evening the weather being cold it buried itself in the loose mould and continues still concealed  As it will be under my eye I shall now have an opportunity of enlarging my observations on it's mode of life and propensities and perceive already that towards the time of coming forth it opens a breathing place in the ground near it's head requiring I conclude a freer respiration as it becomes more alive This creature not only goes under the earth from the middle of  November  to the middle of  April  but sleeps great part of the summer for it goes to bed in the longest days at four in the afternoon and often does not stir in the morning till late Besides it retires to rest for every shower and does not move at all in wet days  When one reflects on the state of this strange being it is a matter of wonder to find that Providence should bestow such a profusion of days such a seeming waste of longevity on a reptile that appears to relish it so little as to squander more than two thirds of it's existence in a joyless stupor and be lost to all sensation for months together in the profoundest of slumbers  While I was writing this letter a moist and warm afternoon with the thermometer at brought forth troops of  shellsnails  and at the same juncture the  tortoise  heaved up the mould and put out it's head and the next morning came forth as it were raised from the dead and walked about till four in the afternoon This was a curious coincidence a very amusing occurrence to see such a similarity of feelings between the two  for so the  Greeks  called both the  shellsnail  and the  tortoise  Summer birds are this cold and backward spring unusually late I have seen but one swallow yet This conformity with the weather convinces me more and more that they sleep in the winter  LETTER LI TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Sept  I HAVE now read your miscellanies through with much care and satisfaction and am to return you my best thanks for the honourable mention made in them of me as a naturalist which I wish I may deserve  In some former letters I expressed my suspicions that many of the housemartins do not depart in the winter far from this village I therefore determined to make some search about the southeast end of the hill where I imagined they might slumber out the uncomfortable months of winter But supposing that the examination would be made to the best advantage in the spring and observing that no martins had appeared by the th of  April  last on that day I employed some men to explore the shrubs and cavities of the suspected spot The persons took pains but without any success however a remarkable incident occurred in the midst of our pursuitwhile the labourers were at work a housemartin the first that had been seen this year came down the village in the sight of several people and went at once into a nest where it stayed a short time and then flew over the houses for some days after no martins were observed not till the th of  April  and then only a pair Martins in general were remarkably late this year  LETTER LII TO THE SAME  SELBORNE  Sept  I HAVE just met with a circumstance respecting swifts which furnishes an exception to the whole tenor of my observations ever since I have bestowed any attention on that species of hirundines Our swifts in general withdrew this year about the first day of  August  all save one pair which in two or three days was reduced to a single bird The perseverance of this individual made me suspect that the strongest of motives that of an attachto her young could alone occasion so late a stay I watched therefore till the twentyfourth of  August  and then discovered that under the eaves of the church she attended upon two young which were fledged and now put out their white chins from a crevice These remained till the twentyseventh looking more alert every day and seeming to long to be on the wing After this day they were missing at once nor could I ever observe them with their dam coursing round the church in the act of learning to fly as the first broods evidently do On the thirtyfirst I caused the eaves to be searched but we found in the nest only two callow dead stinking swifts on which a second nest had been formed This double nest was full of the black shining cases of the  hippoboscae hirundinis  The following remarks on this unusual incident are obvious The first is that though it may be disagreeable to swifts to remain  beyond the beginning of  August  yet that they can subsist longer is undeniable The second is that this uncommon event as it was owing to the loss of the first brood so it corroborates my former remark that swifts breed regularly but once since was the contrary the case the occurrence above could neither be new nor rare  PS One swift was seen at  Lyndon  in the county of  Rutland  in so late as the third of  September  LETTER LIII TO THE SAME  AS I have sometimes known you make inquiries about several kinds of insects I shall here send you an account of one sort which I little expected to have found in this kingdom I had often observed that one particular part of a vine growing on the walls of my house was covered in the autumn with a black dustlike appearance on which the flies fed eagerly and that the shoots and leaves thus affected did not thrive nor did the fruit ripen To this substance I applied my glasses but could not discover that it had any thing to do with animal life as I at first expected but upon a closer examination behind the larger  boughs we were surprised to find that they were coated over with husky shells from whose sides proceeded a cottonlike substance surrounding a multitude of eggs This curious and uncommon production put me upon recollecting what I have heard and read concerning the  coccus vitis viniferae  of  Linnaeus  which in the south of  Europe  infests many vines and is an horrid and loathsome pest As soon as I had turned to the accounts given of this insect I saw at once that it swarmed on my vine and did not appear to have been at all checked by the preceding winter which had been uncommonly severe  Not being then at all aware that it had any thing to do with  England  I was much inclined to think that it came from  Gibraltar  among the many boxes and packages of plants and birds which I had formerly received from thence and especially as the vine infested grew immediately under my studywindow where I usually kept my specimens True it is that I had received nothing from thence for some years but as insects we know are conveyed from one country to another in a very unexpected manner and have a wonderful power of maintaining their existence till they fall into a  nidus  proper for their support and increase I cannot but suspect still that these  cocei  came to me originally from  Andalusia  Yet all the while candour obliges me to confess that Mr  Lightfoot  has written me word that he once and but once saw these insects on a vine at  Weymouth  in  Dorsetshire  which it is here to be observed is a seaport town to which the  coccus  might be conveyed by shipping  As many of my readers may possibly never have heard of this strange and unusual insect I shall here transcribe a passage from a natural history of  Gibraltar  written by the Reverend  John White  late vicar of  Blackburn  in  Lancashire  but not yet published  "In the year a vine which grew on the eastside of my house and which had produced the finest crops of grapes for years past was suddenly overspread on all the woody branches with large lumps of a white fibrous substance resembling spiders webs or rather raw cotton It was of a very clammy quality sticking fast to every thing that touched it and capable of being spun into long threads At first I suspected it to be the product of spiders but could find none Nothing was to be seen connected with it but many  brown oval husky shells  which by no means looked like insects but rather resembled bits of the dry bark of the vine The tree had a plentiful crop of grapes set when this pest appeared upon it but the fruit was manifestly injured by this foul incumbrance It remained all the summer still increasing and loaded the woody and bearing branches to a vast degree I often pulled off great quantities by handfuls but it was so slimy and tenacious that it could by no means be cleared The grapes never filled to their natural perfection but turned watery and vapid Upon perusing the works afterwards of M de  Reaumur  I found this matter perfectly described and accounted for Those husky shells which I had observed were no other than the  female coccus  from whose sides this cottonlike substance exsudes and serves as a covering and security for their eggs"  To this account I think proper to add that though the female  cocci  are stationary and seldom remove from the place to which they stick yet the male is a winged insect and that the black dust which I saw was undoubtedly the excrement of the females which is eaten by ants as well as flies Though the utmost severity of our winter did not destroy these insects yet the attention of the gardener in a summer or two has entirely relieved my vine from this filthy annoyance  As we have remarked above that insects are often conveyed from one country to another in a very unaccountable manner I shall here mention an emigration of small  aphides  which was observed in the village of  Selborne  no longer ago than  August  the st  At about three o'clock in the afternoon of that day which was very hot the people of this village were surprised by a shower of  aphides  or  smotherflies  which fell in these parts Those that were walking in the street at that juncture found themselves covered with these insects which settled also on the hedges and gardens blackening all the vegetables where they alighted My annuals were discoloured with them and the stalks of a bed of onions were quite coated over for six days after These armies were then no doubt in a state of emigration and shifting their quarters and might have come as far as we know from the great hopplantations of  Kent  or  Sussex  the wind being all that day in the easterly quarter They were observed at the same time in great clouds about  Farnham  and all along the vale from  Farnham  to  Alton  For various methods by which several insects shift their quarters see  Derham  's PhysicoTheology    LETTER LIV TO THE SAME  DEAR SIR  WHEN I happen to visit a family where  gold  and  silver fishes  are kept in a glass bowl I am always pleased with the occurrence because it offers me an opportunity of observing the actions and propensities of those beings with whom we can be little acquainted in their natural state Not long since I spent a fortnight at the house of a friend where there was such a  vivary  to which I paid no small attention taking every occasion to remark what passed within it's narrow limits It was here that I first observed the manner in which fishes die As soon as the creature sickens the head sinks lower and lower and it stands as it were on it's head till getting weaker and losing all poise the tail turns over and at last it floats on the surface of the water with it's belly uppermost The reason why fishes when dead swim in that manner is very obvious because when the body is no longer balanced by the fins of the belly the broad muscular back preponderates by it's own gravity and turns the belly uppermost as lighter from it's being a cavity and because it contains the swimmingbladders which contribute to render it buoyant Some that delight in  gold  and  silver fishes  have adopted a notion that they need no aliment True it is that they will subsist for a long time without any apparent food but what they can collect from pure water frequently changed yet they must draw some support from animalcula and other  nourishment supplied by the water because though they seem to eat nothing yet the consequences of eating often drop from them That they are best pleased with such  jejune  diet may easily be confuted since if you toss them crumbs they will seize them with great readiness not to say greediness however bread should be given sparingly lest turning sour it corrupt the water They will also feed on the waterplant called  lemna duck's meat  and also on small fry  When they want to move a little they gently protrude themselves with their  pinnae pectorales  but it is with their strong muscular tails only that they and all fishes shoot along with such inconceivable rapidity It has been said that the eyes of fishes are immoveable but these apparently turn them forward or backward in their sockets as their occasions require They take little notice of a lighted candle though applied close to their heads but flounce and seem much frightened by a sudden stroke of the hand against the support whereon the bowl is hung especially when they have been motionless and are perhaps asleep As fishes have no eyelids it is not easy to discern when they are sleeping or not because their eyes are always open  Nothing can be more amusing than a glass bowl containing such fishes the double refractions of the glass and water represent them when moving in a shifting and changeable variety of dimensions shades and colours while the two mediums assisted by the concavoconvex shape of the vessel magnify and distort them vastly not to mention that the introduction of another element and it's inhabitants into our parlours engages the fancy in a very agreeable manner  Gold  and  silver fishes  though originally natives of  China  and  Japan  yet are become so well reconciled to our climate as to thrive and multiply very fast in our ponds and stews  Linnaeus  ranks this species of fish under the genus of  cyprinus  or  carp  and calls it  cyprinus auratus  Some people exhibit this sort of fish in a very fanciful way for they cause a glass bowl to be blown with a large hollow space within that does not communicate with it In this cavity they put a bird occasionally so that you may see a goldfinch or a linnet hopping as it were in the midst of the water and the fishes swimming in a circle round it The simple exhibition of the fishes is agreeable and pleasant but in so complicated a way becomes whimsical and unnatural and liable to the objection due to him  "Qui variare cupit rem prodigialitèr unam"  I am c  LETTER LV TO THE SAME  October  DEAR SIR  I THINK I have observed before that much the most considerable part of the  housemartins  withdraw from hence about the first week in  October  but that some the latter broods I am now convinced linger on till towards the middle of that month and that at times once perhaps in two or three years a flight for one day only has shown itself in the first week in  November  Having taken notice in  October  that the last flight was numerous amounting perhaps to one hundred and fifty and that the season was soft and still I was resolved to pay uncommon attention to these late birds to find if possible where they roosted and to determine the precise time of their retreat The mode of life of these latter  hirundines  is very favourable to such a design for they spend the whole day in the sheltered district between me and the  Hanger  sailing about in a placid easy manner and feasting on those insects which love to haunt a spot so secure from ruffling winds As my principal object was to discover the place of their roosting I took care to wait on them before they retired to rest and was much pleased to find that for several evenings together just at a quarter past five in the afternoon they all scudded away in great haste towards the southeast and darted down among the low shrubs above the cottages at the end of the hill This spot in many respects seems to be well calculated for their winter residence for in many parts it is as  steep as the roof of any house and therefore secure from the annoyances of water and it is moreover clothed with beechen shrubs which being stunted and bitten by sheep make the thickest covert imaginable and are so entangled as to be impervious to the smallest spaniel besides it is the nature of underwood beech never to cast it's leaf all the winter so that with the leaves on the ground and those on the twigs no shelter can be more complete I watched them on to the thirteenth and fourteenth of  October  and found their evening retreat was exact and uniform but after this they made no regular appearance Now and then a straggler was seen and on the twentysecond of  October  I observed two in the morning over the village and with them my remarks for the season ended  From all these circumstances put together it is more than probable that this lingering flight at so late a season of the year never departed from the island Had they indulged me that autumn with a  November  visit as I much desired I presume that with proper assistants I should have settled the matter past all doubt but though the third of  November  was a sweet day and in appearance exactly suited to my wishes yet not a martin was to be seen and so I was forced reluctantly to give up the pursuit  I have only to add that were the bushes which cover some acres and are not my own property to be grubbed and carefully examined probably those late broods and perhaps the whole aggregate body of the housemartins of this district might be found there in different secret dormitories and that so far from withdrawing into warmer climes it would appear that they never depart three hundred yards from the village  LETTER LVI TO THE SAME  THEY who write on natural history cannot too frequently advert to  instinct  that wonderful limited faculty which in some instances raises the brute creation as it were above  reason  and in others leaves them so far below it Philosophers have defined  instinct  to be that secret influence by which every species is impelled naturally to pursue at all times the same way or track without any teaching or example whereas  reason  without instruction would often vary and do that by many methods which  instinct  effects by one alone Now this maxim must be taken in a qualified sense for there are instances in which  instinct  does vary and conform to the circumstances of place and convenience  It has been remarked that every species of bird has a mode of nidification peculiar to itself so that a schoolboy would at once pronounce on the sort of nest before him This is the case among fields and woods and wilds but in the villages round  London  where mosses and gossamer and cotton from vegetables are hardly to be found the nest of the  chaffinch  has not that elegant finished appearance nor is it so beautifully studded with lichens as in a more rural district and the  wren  is obliged to construct it's house with straws and dry grasses which do not give it that rotundity and compactness so remarkable in the edifices of that little architect Again the regular nest of the  housemartin  is  hemispheric but where a rafter or a joist or a cornice may happen to stand in the way the nest is so contrived as to conform to the obstruction and becomes flat or oval or compressed  In the following instances  instinct  is perfectly uniform and consistent There are three creatures the  squirrel  the  fieldmouse  and the bird called the  nutbatch sitta Europaea  which live much on hazlenuts and yet they open them each in a different way The first after rasping off the small end splits the shell in two with his long foreteeth as a man does with his knife the second nibbles a hole with his teeth so regular as if drilled with a wimble and yet so small that one would wonder how the kernel can be extracted through it while the last picks an irregular ragged hole with it's bill but as this artist has no paws to hold the nut firm while he pierces it like an adroit workman he fixes it as it were in a vice in some cleft of a tree or in some crevice when standing over it he perforates the stubborn shell We have often placed nuts in the chink of a gatepost where  nuthatches  have been known to haunt and have always found that those birds have readily penetrated them While at work they make a rapping noise that may be heard at a considerable distance  You that understand both the theory and practical part of music may best inform us why  harmony  or  melody  should so strangely affect some men as it were by recollection for days after a concert is over What I mean the following passage will most readily explain  "Praehabebat porrò vocibus humanis instrumentisque harmonicis musicam illam avium non quod aliâ quoque non delectaretur sed quod ex musicâ humanâ relinqueretur in animo continens quaedam attentionemque et somnum conturbans agitatio dum ascensus exscensus tenores ac mutationes  illae sonorum et consonantiarum euntque redeuntque per phantasiamcum nihil tale relinqui possit ex modulationibus avium quae quod non sunt perinde a nobis imitabiles non possunt perinde internam facultatem commovere"  Gassendus in Vitâ Peireskii  This curious quotation strikes me much by so well representing my own case and by describing what I have so often felt but never could so well express When I hear fine music I am haunted with passages therefrom night and day and especially at first waking which by their importunity give me more uneasiness than pleasure elegant lessons still tease my imagination and recur irresistibly to my recollection at seasons and even when I am desirous of thinking of more serious matters  I am c  LETTER LVII TO THE SAME  A RARE and I think a new little bird frequents my garden which I have great reason to think is the  pettichaps  it is common in some parts of the kingdom and I have received formerly several dead specimens from  Gibraltar  This bird much resembles the  whitethroat  but has a more white or rather silvery breast and belly is restless and active like the  willowwrens  and hops from bough to bough examining every part for food it also runs up the stems of the  crownimperials  and putting it's head into the bells of those flowers sips the liquor which stands in the  nectarium  of each petal Sometimes it feeds on the ground like the  hedgesparrow  by hopping about on the grassplots and mown walks  One of my neighbours an intelligent and observing man informs me that in the beginning of  May  and about ten minutes before eight o'clock in the evening he discovered a great cluster of  houseswallows  thirty at least he supposes perching on a willow that hung over the verge of  James Knight  's upperpond His attention was first drawn by the twittering of these birds which sat motionless in a row on the bough with their heads all one way and by their weight pressing down the twig so that it nearly touched the water In this situation he watched them till he could see no longer Repeated accounts of this sort spring and fall induce us greatly to suspect that  houseswallows  have some strong  attachment to water independent of the matter of food and though they may not retire into that element yet they may conceal themselves in the banks of pools and rivers during the uncomfortable months of winter  One of the keepers of  Woolmerforest  sent me a  peregrinefalcon  which he shot on the verge of that district as it was devouring a woodpigeon The  falco peregrinus  or  haggard falcon  is a noble species of hawk seldom seen in the southern counties In winter one was killed in the neighbouring parish of  Faringdon  and sent by me to Mr  Pennant  into  NorthWales  See my tenth and eleventh letter to that gentleman  Since that time I have met with none till now The specimen mentioned above was in fine preservation and not injured by the shot it measured fortytwo inches from wing to wing and twentyone from beak to tail and weighed two pounds and an half standing weight This species is very robust and wonderfully formed for rapine it's breast was plump and muscular it's thighs long thick and brawny and it's legs remarkably short and well set the feet were armed with most formidable sharp long talons the eyelids and cere of the bill were yellow but the irides of the eyes dusky the beak was thick and hooked and of a dark colour and had a jagged process near the end of the upper mandible on each side it's tail or train was short in proportion to the bulk of it's body yet the wings when closed did not extend to the end of the train From it's large and fair proportions it might be supposed to have been a female but I was not permitted to cut open the specimen For one of the birds of prey which are usually lean this was in high case in it's craw were many barleycorns which probably came from the crop of the woodpigeon on  which it was feeding when shot for voracious birds do not eat grain but when devouring their quarry with undistinguishing vehemence swallow bones and feathers and all matters indiscriminately This falcon was probably driven from the mountains of  North Wales  or  Scotland  where they are known to breed by rigorous weather and deep snows that had lately fallen  I am c  LETTER LVIII TO THE SAME  MY near neighbour a young gentleman in the service of the  EastIndia  Company has brought home a dog and a bitch of the  Chinese  breed from  Canton  such as are fattened in that country for the purpose of being eaten they are about the size of a moderate spaniel of a pale yellow colour with coarse bristling hairs on their backs sharp upright ears and peaked heads which give them a very foxlike appearance Their hind legs are unusually straight without any bend at the hock or ham to such a degree as to give them an aukward gait when they trot When they are in motion their tails are curved high over their backs like those of some hounds and have a bare place each on the outside from the tip midway that does not seem to be matter of  accident but somewhat singular Their eyes are jetblack small and piercing the insides of their lips and mouths of the same colour and their tongues blue The bitch has a dewclaw on each hind leg the dog has none When taken out into a field the bitch showed some disposition for hunting and dwelt on the scent of a covey of partridges till she sprung them giving her tongue all the time The dogs in  South America  are dumb but these bark much in a short thick manner like foxes and have a surly savage demeanour like their ancestors which are not domesticated but bred up in sties where they are fed for the table with ricemeal and other farinaceous food These dogs having been taken on board as soon as weaned could not learn much from their dam yet they did not relish flesh when they came to  England  In the islands of the  pacific  ocean the dogs are bred up on vegetables and would not eat flesh when offered them by our circumnavigators  We believe that all dogs in a state of nature have sharp upright foxlike ears and that hanging ears which are esteemed so graceful are the effect of choice breeding and cultivation Thus in the Travels of  Ysbrandt Ides  from  Muscovy  to  China  the dogs which draw the  Tartars  on snowsledges near the river  Oby  are engraved with prickears like those from  Canton  The  Kamschatdales  also train the same sort of sharpeared peaknosed dogs to draw their sledges as may be seen in an elegant print engraved for Captain  Cook  's last voyage round the world  Now we are upon the subject of dogs it may not be impertinent to add that spaniels as all sporsmen know though they hunt partridges and pheasants as it were by instinct and with much delight and alacrity yet will hardly touch their bones when offered as food nor will a mongrel dog of my own though he  is remarkable for finding that sort of game But when we came to offer the bones of partridges to the two  Chinese  dogs they devoured them with much greediness and licked the platter clean  No sporting dogs will flush woodcocks till inured to the scent and trained to the sport which they then pursue with vehemence and transport but then they will not touch their bones but turn from them with abhorrence even when they are hungry  Now that dogs should not be fond of the bones of such birds as they are not disposed to hunt is no wonder but why they reject and do not care to eat their natural game is not so easily accounted for since the end of hunting seems to be that the chase pursued should be eaten Dogs again will not devour the more rancid waterfowls nor indeed the bones of any wildfowls nor will they touch the foetid bodies of birds that feed on offal and garbage and indeed there may be somewhat of providential instinct in this circumstance of dislike for vultures  Hasselquist  in his Travels to the  Levant  observes that the dogs and vultures at  Grand Cairo  maintain such a friendly intercourse as to bring up their young together in the same place  and kites and ravens and crows c were intended to be messmates with dogs  The  Chinese  word for a dog to an  European  ear sounds like  quihloh  over their carrion and seem to be appointed by Nature as fellowscavengers to remove all cadaverous nuisances from the face of the earth  I am c  LETTER LIX TO THE SAME  THE fossil wood buried in the bogs of  Wolmerforest  is not yet all exhausted for the peatcutters now and then stumble upon a log I have just seen a piece which was sent by a labourer of  Oakhanger  to a carpenter of this village this was the butend of a small oak about five feet long and about five inches in diameter It had apparently been severed from the ground by an axe was very ponderous and as black as ebony Upon asking the carpenter for what purpose he had procured it he told me that it was to be sent to his brother a joiner at  Farnham  who was to make use of it in cabinet work by inlaying it along with whiter woods  Those that are much abroad on evenings after it is dark in spring and summer frequently hear a nocturnal bird passing by on the wing and repeating often a short quick note This bird I have remarked myself but never could make out till lately I am assured now that it is the  Stonecurlew charadrius oedicnemus  Some of them pass over or near my house almost every evening after it is dark from the uplands of the hill and  North field  away down towards  Dorton  where among the streams and meadows they find a greater plenty of food Birds that fly by night are obliged to be noisy their notes often repeated become signals or watchwords to keep them together that they may not stray or lose each the other in the dark  The evening proceedings and manoeuvres of the rooks are curious and amusing in the autumn Just before dusk they return in long strings from the foraging of the day and rendezvous by thousands over  Selbornedown  where they wheel round in the air and sport and dive in a playful manner all the while exerting their voices and making a loud cawing which being blended and softened by the distance that we at the village are below them becomes a confused noise or chiding or rather a pleasing murmur very engaging to the imagination and not unlike the cry of a pack of hounds in hollow echoing woods or the rushing of the wind in tall trees or the tumbling of the tide upon a pebbly shore When this ceremony is over with the last gleam of day they retire for the night to the deep beechen woods of  Tisted  and  Ropley  We remember a little girl who as she was going to bed used to remark on such an occurrence in the true spirit of  physicotheology  that the rooks were saying their prayers and yet this child was much too young to be aware that the scriptures have said of the Deitythat  "he feedeth the ravens who call upon him"  I am c  LETTER LX TO THE SAME  IN reading Dr  Huxham's Observationes de Aēre  c written at  Plymouth  I find by those curious and accurate remarks which contain an account of the weather from the year to the year inclusive that though there is frequent rain in that district of  Devonshire  yet the quantity falling is not great and that some years it has been very small for in the rain measured only  inch    thou  and in and again in only Places near the sea have frequent scuds that keep the atmosphere moist yet do not reach far up into the country making thus the maritime situations appear wet when the rain is not considerable In the wettest years at  Plymouth  the Doctor measured only once and again once viz a quantity of rain that has twice been exceeded at  Selborne  in the short period of my observations Dr  Huxham  remarks that frequent small rains keep the air moist while heavy ones render it more dry by beating down the vapours He is also of opinion that the  dingy smoky appearance  in the sky in very dry seasons arises from the want of moisture sufficient to let the light through and render the atmosphere transparent because he had observed several bodies more diaphanous when wet than dry and did never recollect that the air had that look in rainy seasons  My friend who lives just beyond the top of the down brought his three swivel guns to try them in my outlet with their muzzles towards the  Hanger  supposing that the report would have had a great effect but the experiment did not answer his expectation He then removed them to the  Alcove  on the  Hanger  when the sound rushing along the  Lythe  and  Combwood  was very grand but it was at the  Hermitage  that the echoes and repercussions delighted the hearers not only filling the  Lythe  with the roar as if all the beeches were tearing up by the roots but turning to the left they pervaded the vale above  Combwoodponds  and after a pause seemed to take up the crash again and to extend round  Harteleyhangers  and to die away at last among the coppices and coverts of  Wardleham  It has been remarked before that this district is an  anathoth  a place of responses or echoes and therefore proper for such experiments we may farther add that the pauses in echoes when they cease and yet are taken up again like the pauses in music surprise the hearers and have a fine effect on the imagination  The gentleman abovementioned has just fixed a barometer in his parlour at  Newton Valence  The tube was first filled here at  Selborne  twice with care when the mercury agreed and stood exactly with my own but being filled again twice at  Newton  the mercury stood on account of the great elevation of that house threetenths of an inch lower than the barometers at this village and so continues to do be the weight of the atmosphere what it may The plate of the barometer at  Newton  is figured as low as because in stormy weather the mercury there will sometimes descend below We have supposed  Newtonhouse  to stand two hundred feet higher than this house but if the rule holds good which says that mercury in a barometer sinks onetenth  of an inch for every hundred feet elevation then the  Newton  barometer by standing threetenths lower than that of  Selborne  proves that  Newtonhouse  must be three hundred feet higher than that in which I am writing instead of two hundred  It may not be impertinent to add that the barometers at  Selborne  stand threetenths of an inch lower than the barometers at  South Lambeth  whence we may conclude that the former place is about three hundred feet higher than the latter and with good reason because the streams that rise with us run into the  Thames  at  Weybridge  and so to  London  Of course therefore there must be lower ground all the way from  Selborne  to  South Lambeth  the distance between which all the windings and indentings of the streams considered cannot be less than an hundred miles  I am c  LETTER LXI TO THE SAME  SINCE the weather of a district is undoubtedly part of it's natural history I shall make no further apology for the four following letters which will contain many particulars concerning some of the great frosts and a few respecting some very hot summers that have distinguished themselves from the rest during the course of my observations  As the frost in  January  was for the small time it lasted the most severe that we had then known for many years and was remarkably injurious to evergreens some account of it's rigour and reason of it's ravages may be useful and not unacceptable to persons that delight in planting and ornamenting and may particularly become a work that professes never to lose sight of utility  For the last two or three days of the former year there were considerable falls of snow which lay deep and uniform on the ground without any drifting wrapping up the more humble vegetation in perfect security From the first day to the fifth of the new year more snow succeeded but from that day the air became entirely clear and the heat of the sun about noon had a considerable influence in sheltered situations  It was in such an aspect that the snow on the author's evergreens was melted every day and frozen intensely every night so that the laurustines bays laurels and arbutuses looked in three or four days as if they had been burnt in the fire while a neighbour's plantation of the same kind in a high cold situation where the snow was never melted at all remained uninjured  From hence I would infer that it is the repeated melting and freezing of the snow that is so fatal to vegetation rather than the severity of the cold Therefore it highly behoves every planter who wishes to escape the cruel mortification of losing in a few days the labour and hopes of years to bestir himself on such emergencies and if his plantations are small to avail himself of mats cloths peasehaum straw reeds or any such covering for a short time or if his shrubberies are extensive to see that his people go about with prongs and forks and carefully dislodge the snow from the boughs since the naked foliage will shift much better for itself than where the snow is partly melted and frozen again  It may perhaps appear at first like a paradox but doubtless the more tender trees and shrubs should never be planted in hot aspects not only for the reason assigned above but also because thus circumstanced they are disposed to shoot earlier in the spring and to grow on later in the autumn than they would otherwise do and so are sufferers by lagging or early frosts For this reason also plants from  Siberia  will hardly endure our climate because on the very first advances of spring they shoot away and so are cut off by the severe nights of  March  or  April  Dr  Fothergill  and others have experienced the same inconvenience with respect to the more tender shrubs from  NorthAmerica  which they therefore plant under northwalls There should also perhaps  be a wall to the east to defend them from the piercing blasts from that quarter  This observation might without any impropriety be carried into animal life for discerning beemasters now find that their hives should not in the winter be exposed to the hot sun because such unseasonable warmth awakens the inhabitants too early from their slumbers and by putting their juices into motion too soon subjects them afterwards to inconveniencies when rigorous weather returns  The coincidents attending this short but intense frost were that the horses fell sick with an epidemic distemper which injured the winds of many and killed some that colds and coughs were general among the human species that it froze under people's beds for several nights that meat was so hard frozen that it could not be spitted and could not be secured but in cellars that several redwings and thrushes were killed by the frost and that the large titmouse continued to pull straws lengthwise from the eaves of thatched houses and barns in a most adroit manner for a purpose that has been explained already  See Letter xli to Mr  Pennant    On the d of  January Benjamin Martin  's thermometer within doors in a close parlour where there was no fire fell in the night to and on the th to and on the th to ½ a degree of cold which the owner never since saw in the same situation and he regrets much that he was not able at that juncture to attend his instrument abroad All this time the wind continued north and northeast and yet on the th roostcocks which had been silent began to sound their clarions and crows to clamour as prognostic of milder weather and moreover moles began to  heave and work and a manifest thaw took place From the latter circumstance we may conclude that thaws often originate under ground from warm vapours which arise else how should subterraneous animals receive such early intimations of their approach Moreover we have often observed that cold seems to descend from above for when a thermometer hangs abroad in a frosty night the intervention of a cloud shall immediately raise the mercury ten degrees and a clear sky shall again compel it to descend to it's former gage  And here it may be proper to observe on what has been said above that though frosts advance to their utmost severity by somewhat of a regular gradation yet thaws do not usually come on by as regular a declension of cold but often take place immediately from intense freezing as men in sickness often mend at once from a paroxysm  To the great credit of  Portugal  laurels and  American  junipers be it remembered that they remained untouched amidst the general havock hence men should learn to ornament chiefly with such trees as are able to withstand accidental severities and not subject themselves to the vexation of a loss which may befall them once perhaps in ten years yet may hardly be recovered through the whole course of their lives  As it appeared afterwards the ilexes were much injured the cypresses were half destroyed the arbutuses lingered on but never recovered and the bays laurustines and laurels were killed to the ground and the very wild hollies in hot aspects were so much affected that they cast all their leaves  By the th of  January  the snow was entirely gone the turnips emerged not damaged at all save in sunny places the wheat looked delicately and the garden plants were well preserved  for snow is the most kindly mantle that infant vegetation can be wrapped in were it not for that friendly meteor no vegetable life could exist at all in northerly regions Yet in  Sweden  the earth in  April  is not divested of snow for more than a fortnight before the face of the country is covered with flowers  LETTER LXI TO THE SAME  THERE were some circumstances attending the remarkable frost in  January  so singular and striking that a short detail of them may not be unacceptable  The most certain way to be exact will be to copy the passages from my journal which were taken from time to time as things occurred But it may be proper previously to remark that the first week in  January  was uncommonly wet and drowned with vast rains from every quarter from whence may be inferred as there is great reason to believe is the case that intense frosts seldom take place till the earth is perfectly glutted and chilled with water  The autumn preceding  January  was very wet and particularly the month of  September  during which there fell at  Lyndon  in the county of  Rutland six inches and an half  of rain And the terrible long frost in set in after a rainy season and when the springs were very high  and hence dry autumns are seldom followed by rigorous winters  January  thSnow driving all the day which was followed by frost sleet and some snow till the th when a prodigious mass overwhelmed all the works of men drifting over the tops of the gates and filling the hollow lanes  On the th the writer was obliged to be much abroad and thinks he never before or since has encountered such rugged  Siberian  weather Many of the narrow roads were now filled above the tops of the hedges through which the snow was driven into most romantic and grotesque shapes so striking to the imagination as not to be seen without wonder and pleasure The poultry dared not to stir out of their roosting places for cocks and hens are so dazzled and confounded by the glare of snow that they would soon perish without assistance The hares also lay sullenly in their seats and would not move till compelled by hunger being conscious poor animals that the drifts and heaps treacherously betray their footsteps and prove fatal to numbers of them  From the th the snow continued to increase and began to stop the road waggons and coaches which could no longer keep on their regular stages and especially on the western roads where the fall appears to have been deeper than in the south The company at  Bath  that wanted to attend the  Queen's birthday  were strangely incommoded many carriages of persons who got in their way to town from  Bath  as far as  Marlborough  after strange embarrassments here met with a  ne plus ultra  The ladies fretted and offered large rewards to labourers if they would shovel them a track to  London  but the relentless heaps of snow were too bulky to be removed and so the th passed over leaving the company in very uncomfortable circumstances at the  Castle  and other inns  On the th the sun shone out for the first time since the frost began a circumstance that has been remarked before much in favour of vegetation All this time the cold was not very intense for the thermometer stood at and thereabout but on the st it descended to The birds now began to be in a very pitiable and starving condition Tamed by the season skylarks settled in the streets of towns because they saw the ground was bare rooks frequented dunghills close to houses and crows watched horses as they passed and greedily devoured what dropped from them hares now came into men's gardens and scraping away the snow devoured such plants as they could find  On the d the author had occasion to go to  London  through a sort of  Laplandianscene  very wild and grotesque indeed But the metropolis itself exhibited a still more singular appearance than the country for being bedded deep in snow the pavement of the streets could not be touched by the wheels or the horses' feet so that the carriages ran about without the least noise Such an exemption from din and clatter was strange but not pleasant it seemed to convey an uncomfortable idea of desolation  " ipsa silentia terrent"  On the th much snow fell all day and in the evening the frost became very intense At  South Lambeth  sor the four following nights the thermometer fell to and at  Selborne  to and on the st of  January  just before sunrise with rime on the trees and on the tube of the glass the quicksilver sunk exactly to zero being degrees below the freezing point but by eleven in the morning though in the  shade it sprung up to ½  At  Selborne  the cold was greater than at any other place that the author could hear of with certainty though some reported at the time that at a village in  Kent  the thermometer fell two degrees below zero  viz  degrees below the freezing point  The thermometer used at  Selborne  was graduated by  Benjamin Martin  a most unusual degree of cold this for the south of  England  During these four nights the cold was so penetrating that it occasioned ice in warm chambers and under beds and in the day the wind was so keen that persons of robust constitutions could scarcely endure to face it The  Thames  was at once so frozen over both above and below bridge that crowds ran about on the ice The streets were now strangely encumbered with snow which crumbled and trod dusty and turning grey resembled baysalt what had fallen on the roofs was so perfectly dry that from first to last it lay twentysix days on the houses in the city a longer time than had been remembered by the oldest housekeepers living According to all appearances we might now have expected the continuance of this rigorous weather for weeks to come since every night increased in severity but behold without any apparent cause on the st of  February  a thaw took place and some rain followed before night making good the observation above that frosts often go off as it were at once without any gradual declension of cold On the d of  February  the thaw persisted and on the d swarms of little insects were frisking and sporting in a courtyard at  South Lambeth  as if they had felt no frost Why the juices in the small bodies and smaller limbs of such minute beings are not frozen is a matter of curious inquiry  Severe frosts seem to be partial or to run in currents for at the same juncture as the author was informed by accurate correspondents  at  Lyndon  in the county of  Rutland  the thermometer stood at at  Blackburn  in  Lancashire  at and at  Manchester  at and Thus does some unknown circumstance strangely overbalance latitude and render the cold sometimes much greater in the southern than the northern parts of this kingdom  The consequences of this severity were that in  Hampshire  at the melting of the snow the wheat looked well and the turnips came forth little injured The laurels and laurustines were somewhat damaged but only in  hot aspects  No evergreens were quite destroyed and not half the damage sustained that befell in  January  Those laurels that were a little scorched on the southsides were perfectly untouched on their northsides The care taken to shake the snow day by day from the branches seemed greatly to avail the author's evergreens A neighbour's laurelhedge in a high situation and facing to the north was perfectly green and vigorous and the  Portugal laurels  remained unhurt  As to the birds the thrushes and blackbirds were mostly destroyed and the partridges by the weather and poachers were so thinned that few remained to breed the following year  LETTER LXII TO THE SAME  AS the frost in  December  was very extraordinary you I trust will not be displeased to hear the particulars and especially when I promise to say no more about the severities of winter after I have finished this letter  The first week in  December  was very wet with the barometer very low On the th with the barometer at five tenths came on a vast snow which continued all that day and the next and most part of the following night so that by the morning of the th the works of men were quite overwhelmed the lanes filled so as to be impassable and the ground covered twelve or fifteen inches without any drifting In the evening of the th the air began to be so very sharp that we thought it would be curious to attend to the motions of a thermometer we therefore hung out two one made by  Martin  and one by  Dollond  which soon began to shew us what we were to expect for by ten o'clock they fell to and at eleven to when we went to bed On the th in the morning the quicksilver of  Dollond  's glass was down to  half a degree below zero  and that of  Martin  's which was absurdly graduated only to four degrees  above zero  sunk quite into the brass guard of the ball so that when the weather became most interesting this was useless On the th at eleven at night though the air was perfectly still  Dollond  's glass went down  to  one degree below zero  This strange severity of the weather made me very desirous to know what degree of cold there might be in such an exalted and near situation as  Newton  We had therefore on the morning of the th written to Mr and entreated him to hang out his thermometer made by  Adams  and to pay some attention to it morning and evening expecting wonderful phaenomena in so elevated a region at two hundred feet or more above my house But behold on the th at eleven at night it was down only to and the next morning at when mine was at ten We were so disturbed at this unexpected reverse of comparative local cold that we sent one of my glasses up thinking that of Mr must some how be wrongly constructed But when the instruments came to be confronted they went exactly together so that for one night at least the cold at  Newton  was degrees less than at  Selborne  and through the whole frost or degrees and indeed when we came to observe consequences we could readily credit this for all my laurustines bays ilexes arbutuses cypresses and even my  Portugal laurels  Mr  Miller  in his Gardener's Dictionary says positively that the  Portugal laurels  remained untouched in the remarkable frost of So that either that accurate observer was much mistaken or else the frost of  December  was much more severe and destructive than that in the year above mentioned  and which occasions more regret my fine sloping laurelhedge were scorched up while at  Newton  the same trees have not lost a leaf  We had steady frost on to the th when the thermometer in the morning was down to with us and at  Newton  only to Strong frost continued till the st when some tendency to thaw was observed and by  January  the d the thaw was confirmed and some rain fell  A circumstance that I must not omit because it was new to us is that on  Friday December  the th being bright sunshine the air was full of icy  spiculae  floating in all directions like atoms in a sunbeam let into a dark room We thought them at first particles of the rime falling from my tall hedges but were soon convinced to the contrary by making our observations in open places where no rime could reach us Were they watery particles of the air frozen as they floated or were they evaporations from the snow frozen as they mounted  We were much obliged to the thermometers for the early information they gave us and hurried our apples pears onions potatoes c into the cellar and warm closets while those who had not or neglected such warnings lost all their store of roots and fruits and had their very bread and cheese frozen  I must not omit to tell you that during those two  Siberian  days my parlourcat was so electric that had a person stroked her and been properly  insulated  the shock might have been given to a whole circle of people  I forgot to mention before that during the two severe days two men who were tracing hares in the snow had their feet frozen and two men who were much better employed had their fingers so affected by the frost while they were thrashing in a barn that a mortification followed from which they did not recover for many weeks  This frost killed all the furze and most of the ivy and in many places stripped the hollies of all their leaves It came at a very early time of the year before old  November  ended and yet may be allowed from it's effects to have exceeded any since  LETTER LXIII TO THE SAME  As the effects of heat are seldom very remarkable in the northerly climate of  England  where the summers are often so defective in warmth and sunshine as not to ripen the fruits of the earth so well as might be wished I shall be more concise in my account of the severity of a summer season and so make a little amends for the prolix account of the degrees of cold and the inconveniences that we suffered from some late rigorous winters  The summers of and were unusually hot and dry to them therefore I shall turn back in my journals without recurring to any more distant period In the former of these years my peach and nectarinetrees suffered so much from the heat that the rind on the bodies was scalded and came off since which the trees have been in a decaying state This may prove a hint to assiduous gardeners to fence and shelter their walltrees with mats or boards as they may easily do because such annoyance is seldom of long continuance During that summer also I observed that my apples were coddled as it were on the trees so that they had no quickness of flavour and would not keep in the winter This circumstance put me in mind of what I have heard travellers assert that they never ate a good apple or apricot in the south of  Europe  where the heats were so great as to render the juices vapid and insipid  The great pests of a garden are wasps which destroy all the finer fruits just as they are coming into perfection In we had none in there were myriads which would have devoured all the produce of my garden had not we set the boys to take the nests and caught thousands with hazeltwigs tipped with birdlime we have since employed the boys to take and destroy the large breeding wasps in the spring Such expedients have a great effect on these marauders and will keep them under Though wasps do not abound but in hot summers yet they do not prevail in every hot summer as I have instanced in the two years abovementioned  In the sultry season of honeydews were so frequent as to deface and destroy the beauties of my garden My honeysuckles which were one week the most sweet and lovely objects that the eye could behold became the next the most loathsome being enveloped in a viscous substance and loaded with black aphides or smotherflies The occasion of this clammy appearance seems to be this that in hot weather the effluvia of flowers in fields and meadows and gardens are drawn up in the day by a brisk evaporation and then in the night fall down again with the dews in which they are entangled that the air is strongly scented and therefore impregnated with the particles of flowers in summer weather our senses will inform us and that this clammy sweet substance is of the vegetable kind we may learn from bees to whom it is very grateful and we may be assured that it falls in the night because it is always first seen in warm still mornings  On chalky and sandy soils and in the hot villages about  London  the thermometer has been often observed to mount as high as or but with us in this hilly and woody district I have hardly ever seen it exceed nor does it often arrive at that pitch The reason I conclude is that our dense clayey soil so much shaded by trees is not so easily heated through as those abovementioned and besides our mountains cause currents of air and breezes and the vast effluvia from our woodlands temper and moderate our heats  LETTER LXIV TO THE SAME  THE summer of the year was an amazing and portentous one and full of horrible phaenomena for besides the alarming meteors and tremendous thunderstorms that affrighted and distressed the different counties of this kingdom the peculiar  haze  or smokey fog that prevailed for many weeks in this island and in every part of  Europe  and even beyond it's limits was a most extraordinary appearance unlike any thing known within the memory of man By my journal I find that I had noticed this strange occurrence from  June  to  July  inclusive during which period the wind varied to every quarter without making any alteration  in the air The sun at noon looked as blank as a clouded moon and shed a rustcoloured ferruginous light on the ground and floors of rooms but was particularly lurid and bloodcoloured at rising and setting All the time the heat was so intense that butchers' meat could hardly be eaten on the day after it was killed and the flies swarmed so in the lanes and hedges that they rendered the horses half frantic and riding irksome The country people began to look with a superstitious awe at the red louring aspect of the sun and indeed there was reason for the most enlightened person to be apprehensive for all the while  Calabria  and part of the isle of  Sicily  were torn and convulsed with earthquakes and about that juncture a  volcano  sprung out of the sea on the coast of  Norway  On this occasion  Milton  's noble simile of the sun in his first book of  Paradise Lost  frequently occurred to my mind and it is indeed particularly applicable because towards the end it alludes to a superstitious kind of dread with which the minds of men are always impressed by such strange and unusual phaenomena  " As when the  sun  new risen  "Looks through the horizontal  misty  air  "  Shorn  of his  beams  or from behind the moon  "  In  dim  eclipse  disastrous twilight sheds  "On half the nations and with  fear  of  change  "  Perplexes  monarchs "  LETTER LXV TO THE SAME  WE are very seldom annoyed with thunderstorms and it is no less remarkable than true that those which arise in the south have hardly been known to reach this village for before they get over us they take a direction to the east or to the west or sometimes divide into two and go in part to one of those quarters and in part to the other as was truly the case in summer when though the country round was continually harassed with tempests and often from the south yet we escaped them all as appears by my journal of that summer The only way that I can at all account for this factfor such it isis that on that quarter between us and the sea there are continual mountains hill behind hill such as  Norehill  the  Barnet Butserbill  and  Portsdown  which some how divert the storms and give them a different direction High promontories and elevated grounds have always been observed to attract clouds and disarm them of their mischievous contents which are discharged into the trees and summits as soon as they come in contact with those turbulent meteors while the humble vales escape because they are so far beneath them  But when I say I do not remember a thunderstorm from the south I do not mean that we never have suffered from thunderstorms  at all for on  June  th the thermometer in the morning being at and at noon at the barometer at six tenths onehalf and the wind north I observed a blue mist smelling strongly of sulphur hanging along our sloping woods and seeming to indicate that thunder was at hand I was called in about two in the afternoon and so missed seeing the gathering of the clouds in the north which they who were abroad assured me had something uncommon in it's appearance At about a quarter after two the storm began in the parish of  Hartley  moving slowly from north to south and from thence it came over  Nortonfarm  and so to  Grangefarm  both in this parish It began with vast drops of rain which were soon succeeded by round hail and then by convex pieces of ice which measured three inches in girth Had it been as extensive as it was violent and of any continuance for it was very short it must have ravaged all the neighbourhood In the parish of  Hartley  it did some damage to one farm but  Norton  which lay in the center of the storm was greatly injured as was  Grange  which lay next to it It did but just reach to the middle of the village where the hail broke my north windows and all my gardenlights and handglasses and many of my neighbours' windows The extent of the storm was about two miles in length and one in breadth We were just sitting down to dinner but were soon diverted from our repast by the clattering of tiles and the jingling of glass There fell at the same time prodigious torrents of rain on the farms abovementioned which occasioned a flood as violent as it was sudden doing great damage to the meadows and fallows by deluging the one and washing away the soil of the other The hollow lane towards  Alton  was so torn and disordered as not to be passable till mended rocks being removed that weighed weight Those that saw the effect which the  great hail had on ponds and pools say that the dashing of the water made an extraordinary appearance the froth and spray standing up in the air three feet above the surface The rushing and roaring of the hail as it approached was truly tremendous  Though the clouds at  South Lambeth  near  London  were at that juncture thin and light and no storm was in sight nor within hearing yet the air was strongly electric for the bells of an electric machine at that place rang repeatedly and fierce sparks were discharged  When I first took the present work in hand I proposed to have added an  Annus Historiconaturalis  or The Natural History of the Twelve Months of the Year which would have comprised many incidents and occurrences that have not fallen in my way to be mentioned in my series of lettersbut as Mr  Aikin  of  Warrington  has lately published somewhat of this sort and as the length of my correspondence has sufficiently put your patience to the test I shall here take a respectful leave of you and natural history together  And am With all due deference and regard Your most obliged And most humble servant GIL WHITE  SELBORNE  June  THE ANTIQUITIES OF SELBORNE IN THE COUNTY OF SOUTHAMPTON  seal of the priory of Selborne  BEATE MARIE D'SELEBVRN SIGIL CONVENTVS ECCLE  JUVAT IRE  DESERTOSQUE VIDERE LOCOS  VIRGIL  THE ANTIQUITIES OF SELBORNE  LETTER I  IT is reasonable to suppose that in remote ages this woody and mountainous district was inhabited only by bears and wolves Whether the  Britons  ever thought it worthy their attention is not in our power to determine but we may safely conclude from circumstances that it was not unknown to the  Romans  Old people remember to have heard their fathers and grandfathers say that in dry summers and in windy weather pieces of money were sometimes found round the verge of  Woolmerpond  and tradition had inspired the foresters with a notion that the bottom of that lake contained great stores of treasure During the spring and summer  of there was little rain and the following summer also was so uncommonly dry that many springs and ponds failed and this lake in particular whose bed became as dusty as the surrounding heaths and wastes This favourable juncture induced some of the forestcottagers to begin a search which was attended with such success that all the labourers in the neighbourhood flocked to the spot and with spades and hoes turned up great part of that large area Instead of pots of coins as they expected they found great heaps the one lying on the other as if shot out of a bag many of which were in good preservation Silver and gold these inquirers expected to find but their discoveries consisted solely of many hundreds of  Roman  coppercoins and some medallions all of the lower empire There was not much  virtù  stirring at that time in this neighbourhood however some of the gentry and clergy around bought what pleased them best and some dozens fell to the share of the author  The owners at first held their commodity at an high price but finding that they were not likely to meet with dealers at such a rate they soon lowered their terms and sold the fairest as they could The coins that were rejected became current and passed for farthings at the petty shops Of those that we saw the greater part were of  Marcus Aurelius  and the Empress  Faustina  his wife the father and mother of  Commodus  Some of  Faustina  were in high relief and exhibited a very agreeable set of features which probably resembled that lady who was more celebrated for her beauty than for her virtues The medallions in general were of a paler colour than the coins To pretend to account for the means of their coming to this place would be spending time in conjecture The spot I think could not be a  Roman  camp because it is commanded by hills on two sides nor does it shew the least traces  of entrenchments nor can I suppose that it was a  Roman  town because I have too good an opinion of the taste and judgment of those polished conquerors to imagine that they would settle on so barren and dreary a waste  LETTER II  THAT  Selborne  was a place of some distinction and note in the time of the  Saxons  we can give most undoubted proofs But as there are few if any accounts of villages before  Domesday  it will be best to begin with that venerable record  "Ipse rex tenet  Selesburne Eddid  regina tenuit et nunquam geldavit De isto manerio dono dedit rex  Radfredo  presbytero dimidiam hidam cum ecelesia Tempore regis  Edwardi  et post valuit duodecim solidos et sex denarios modo octo solidos et quatuor denarios"  Here we see that  Selborne  was a royal manor and that  Editha  the queen of  Edward  the Confessor had been lady of that manor and was succeeded in it by the Conqueror and that it had a church Beside these many circumstances concur to prove it to have been a  Saxon  village such as the name of the place itself  Selesburne Seleburne Selburn Selbourn Selborne  and  Selborn  as it has been variously spelt at different periods is of  Saxon  derivation for  Sel  signifies  great  and  burn  torrens a  brook  or  rivulet  so that the name seems to be derived from the great perennial stream that breaks out at the upper end of the village  Sel  also signifies  bonus  item  foecundus fertilis  "    foecunda graminis clausura fertile pascuum  a meadow in the parish of  Godelming  is still called  Salgarston  "  Lye's Saxon Dictionary in the Supplement by Mr  Manning    the names of many fields and some families  Thus the name of  Aldred  signifies  allreverend  and that of  Kemp  means a  soldier  Thus we have a  churchlitton  or enclosure for dead bodies and not a  churchyard  there is also a  Culvercroft  near the  Grangefarm  being the enclosure where the priory  pigeonhouse  stood from  culver  a pigeon Again there are three steep pastures in this parish called the  Lithe  from  Hlithe clivus  The wickerwork that binds and fastens down a hedge on the top is called  ether  from  ether  an hedge When the good women call their hogs they cry  sic sic  Laconus  un Porceau chez les  Lacèdemoniens  ce mot a sans doute estè pris  sic  pour marqu  un porceau Encore aujour'huy quand les  Bretons  chassent ces animaus ils ne disent point autrement que  sic sic  Antiquitè de la Nation et de la Langue des Celtes par Pezron  not knowing that  sic  is  Saxon  or rather  Celtic  for a hog Coppice or brush wood our countrymen call  rise  from  hris  frondes and talk of a load of  rise  Within the author's memory the  Saxon  plurals  housen  and  peason  were in common use But it would be endless to instance in every circumstance he that wishes for more specimens must frequent a farmer's kitchen I have therefore selected some words to shew how familiar the  Saxen  dialect was to this district since in more than seven hundred years it is fur from being obliterated  with a variety of words in husbandry and common life still subsisting among the country people  What probably first drew the attention of the  Saxons  to this spot was the beautiful spring or fountain called  Wellhead  Wellhead  signifies  spring head  and not a deep pit from whence we draw water For particulars about which see Letter I to Mr  Pennant  which induced them to build by the banks of that perennial current for ancient settlers loved to reside by brooks and rivulets where they could dip for their water without the trouble and expense of digging wells and of drawing  It remains still unsettled among the antiquaries at what time tracts of land were first appropriated to the chase alone for the amusement of the sovereign Whether our  Saxon  monarchs had any royal forests does not I believe appear on record but the  Constitutiones de Foresta  of  Canute  the Dane are come down to us We shall not therefore pretend to say whether  Woolmerforest  existed as a royal domain before the conquest If it did not we may suppose it  was laid out by some of our earliest  Norman  kings who were exceedingly attached to the pleasures of the chase and resided much at  Winchester  which lies at a moderate distance from this destrict The  Plantagenet  princes seem to have been pleased with  Woolmer  for tradition says that king  John  resided just upon the verge at  Wardleham  on a regular and remarkable mount still called  King John's Hill  and  Lodge Hill  and  Edward  III had a chapel in his park or enclosure at  Kingsley  The parish of  Kingsley  lies between and divides  Woolmerforest  from  Ayles Holtforest  See Letter IX to Mr  Pennant    Humphrey  duke of  Gloucester  and  Richard  duke of  York  say my evidences were both in their turns  wardens  of  Woolmerforest  which seems to have served for an appointment for the younger princes of the royal family as it may again  I have intentionally mentioned  Edward  III and the dukes  Humphrey  and  Richard  before king  Edward  II because I have reserved for the entertainment of my readers a pleasant anecdote respecting that prince with which I shall close this letter  As  Edward  II was hunting on  Woolmerforest Morris Ken  of the kitchen fell from his horse several times at which accidents the king laughed immoderately and when the chase was over ordered him twenty shillings  "Item paid at the lodge at  Woolmer  when the king was staghunting there to  Morris Ken  of the kitchen because he rode before the king and often fell from his horse at which the king laughed exceedinglya gift by command of twenty shillings"  A MSS in possession of  Thomas Astle  esq containing the private expenses of  Edward  II  an enormous sum for those days Proper allowances ought to be made for the youth of this monarch whose spirits also we may suppose were much exhilarated by the sport of the day but at the same time it is reasonable to remark  that whatever might be the occasion of  Ken  's first fall the subsequent ones seem to have been designed The scullion appears to have been an artful fellow and to have seen the king's foible which furnishes an early specimen of that his easy softness and facility of temper of which the infamous  Gaveston  took such advantages as brought innumerable calamities on the nation and involved the prince at last in misfortunes and sufferings too deplorable to be mentioned without horror and amazement  LETTER III  FROM the silence of  Domesday  respecting churches it has been supposed that few villages had any at the time when that record was taken but  Selborne  we see enjoyed the benefit of one hence we may conclude that this place was in no abject state even at that very distant period How many fabrics have succeeded each other since the days of  Radfredrus  the  presbyter  we cannot pretend to say our business leads us to a description of the present edifice in which we shall be circumstantial  Our church which was dedicated to the  Virgin Mary  consists of three ailes and measures fiftyfour feet in length by fortyseven in breadth being almost as broad as it is long The present building has no pretensions to antiquity and is as I suppose of no earlier date than the beginning of the reign of  Henry  VII  south view of Selborne church  Pl VI Pa  South View of SELBORNE CHURCH  P Mazell sculp S H Grimm del  Published    by B White Son  It is perfectly plain and unadorned without painted glass carved work sculpture or tracery But when I say it has no claim to antiquity I would mean to be understood of the fabric in general for the pillars which support the roof are undoubtedly old being of that low squat thick order usually called  Saxon  These I should imagine upheld the roof of a former church which falling into decay was rebuilt on those massy props because their strength had preserved them from the injuries of time  In the same manner to compare great things with small did  Wykeham  when he newbuilt the cathedral at  Winchester  from the tower westward apply to his purpose the old piers or pillars of Bishop  Walkelin  's church by blending  Saxon  and  Gothic  architecture together See  Lowth  's Life of Wykeham  Upon these rest blunt  gothic  arches such as prevailed in the reign abovementioned and by which as a criterion we would prove the date of the building  At the bottom of the south aile between the west and south doors stands the font which is deep and capacious and consists of three massy round stones piled one on another without the least ornament or sculpture the cavity at the top is lined with lead and has a pipe at bottom to convey off the water after the sacred ceremony is performed  The east end of the south aile is called the  South Chancel  and till within these thirty years was divided off by old carved  gothic  framework of timber having been a private chantry In this opinion we are more confirmed by observing two  gothic  niches within the space the one in the east wall and the other in the south near which there probably stood images and altars  In the middle aile there is nothing remarkable but I remember when it's beams were hung with garlands in honour of  young women of the parish reputed to have died virgins and recollect to have seen the clerk's wife cutting in white paper the resemblances of gloves and ribbons to be twisted into knots and roses to decorate these memorials of chastity In the church of  Faringdon  which is the next parish many garlands of this sort still remain  The north aile is narrow and low with a sloping ceiling reaching within eight or nine feet of the floor It had originally a flat roof covered with lead till within a century past a churchwarden stripping off the lead in order as he said to have it mended sold it to a plumber and ran away with the money This aile has no door for an obvious reason because the northside of the churchyard being surrounded by the vicaragegarden affords no path to that side of the church Nothing can be more irregular than the pews of this church which are of all dimensions and heights being patched up according to the fancy of the owners but whoever nicely examines them will find that the middle aile had on each side a regular row of benches of solid oak all alike with a low backboard to each These we should not hesitate to say are coeval with the present church and especially as it is to be observed that at their ends they are ornamented with carved blunt  gothic  niches exactly correspondent to the arches of the church and to a niche in the south wall The south aile also has a row of these benches but some are decayed through age and the rest much disguised by modern alterations  At the upper end of this aile and running out to the north stands a transept known by the name of the  North Chancel  measuring twentyone feet from south to north and nineteen feet from east to west this was intended no doubt as a private chantry and was also till of late divided off by a  gothic  framework  of timber In its north wall under a very blunt  gothic  arch lies perhaps the founder of this edifice which from the shape of its arch may be deemed no older than the latter end of the reign of  Henry  VII The tomb was examined some years ago but contained nothing except the scull and thighbones of a large tall man and the bones of a youth or woman lying in a very irregular manner without any escutcheon or other token to ascertain the names or rank of the deceased The grave was very shallow and lined with stone at the bottom and on the sides  From the east wall project four stone brackets which I conclude supported images and crucifixes In the great thick pilaster jutting out between this transept and the chancel there is a very sharp  gothic  niche of older date than the present chantry or church But the chief pieces of antiquity are two narrow stone coffinlids which compose part of the floor and lie from west to east with the very narrow ends eastward these belong to remote times and if originally placed here which I doubt must have been part of the pavement of an older transept At present there are no coffins under them whence I conclude they have been removed to this place from some part of a sormer church One of these lids is so eaten by time that no sculpture can be discovered upon it or perhaps it may be the wrong side uppermost but on the other which seems to be of stone of a closer and harder texture is to be discerned a  discus  with a cross on it at the end of a staff or rod the wellknown symbol of a  KnightTemplar  See  Dugdale Monasticon Anglicanum  Vol II where there is a fine engraving of a  KnightTemplar  by  Hollar    This order was distinguished by a red cross on the left shoulder of their cloak and by this attribute in their hand Now if these  stones belonged to  Knights Templars  they must have lain here many centuries for this order came into England early in the reign of king  Stephen  in and was dissolved in the time of  Edward  II in having subsisted only one hundred and ninetynine years Why I should suppose that  Knights Templars  were occasionally buried at this church will appear in some future letter when we come to treat more particularly concerning the property they possessed here and the intercourse that subsisted between them and the  priors  of  Selborne  We must now proceed to the chancel properly so called which seems to be coeval with the church and is in the same plain unadorned style though neatly kept This room measures thirtyone feet in length and sixteen feet and an half in breadth and is wainscoted all round as high as to the bottom of the windows The space for the communion table is raised two steps above the rest of the floor and railed in with oaken balusters Here I shall say somewhat of the windows of the chancel in particular and of the whole fabric in general They are mostly of that simple and unadorned sort called  Lancet  some single some double and some in triplets At the east end of the chancel are two of a moderate size near each other and in the north wall two very distant small ones unequal in length and height and in the south wall are two one on each side of the chancel door that are broad and squat and of a different order At the east end of the south aile of the church there is a large lancetwindow in a triplet and two very small narrow single ones in the south wall and a broad squat window beside and a double lancet one in the west end so that the appearance is very irregular In the north aile are two windows made shorter when the roof was sloped and in the north transept a large triple window shortened  at the time of a repair in when over it was opened a round one of considerable size which affords an agreeable light and renders that chantry the most cheerful part of the edifice  The church and chancels have all coved roofs ceiled about the year before which they were open to the tiles and shingles showing the naked rafters and threatening the congregation with the fall of a spar or a blow from a piece of loose mortar  On the north wall of the chancel is fixed a large oval white marble monument with the following inscription and at the foot of the wall over the deceased and inscribed with his name age arms and time of death lies a large slab of black marble  Prope hunc parietem sepelitur  GILBERTUS WHITE SAMSONIS WHITE de  Oxon militis filius tertius Collegii Magdale  nensis ibidem alumnus socius

were so happily combined  as to deserve the imitation of mankind  And if in any particular he followed more invariably  the steps of his blessed Master  It was in his humility  His parishioners  especially the sick and necessitous  as long as any traces of his memory shall remain  must lament his death  To perpetuate such an example this stone is erected  as while living he was a preacher of righteousness  so by it he being dead yet speaketh  He died April  th  aged years  LETTER IV  WE have now taken leave of the inside of the church and shall pass by a door at the west end of the middle aile into the belfry This room is part of a handsome square embattled tower of fortyfive feet in height and of much more modern date than the church but old enough to have needed a thorough repair in when it was neatly stuccoed at a considerable expense by a set of workmen who were employed on it for the greatest part of the summer The old bells three in number loud and out of tune were taken down in and cast into four to which  Sir Simeon Stuart  the grandfather of the present baronet added a fifth at his own expense and bestowing it in the name of his favourite daughter Mrs  Mary Stuart  caused it to be cast with the following motto round it  "Clara puella dedit dixitque mihi esto Maria  "Illius et laudes nomen ad astra sono"  The day of the arrival of this tuneable peal was observed as an high festival by the village and rendered more joyous by an order from the donor that the treblebell should be fixed bottom upward in the ground and filled with punch of which all present were permitted to partake  The porch of the church to the south is modern and would not be worthy attention did it not shelter a fine sharp  gothic  doorway This is undoubtedly much older than the present fabric and  being found in good preservation was worked into the wall and is the grand entrance into the church nor are the foldingdoors to be passed over in silence since from their thick and clumsy structure and the rude flourishedwork of their hinges they may possibly be as ancient as the doorway itself  The whole roof of the south aile and the southside of the roof of the middle aile is covered with oaken shingles instead of tiles on account of their lightness which favours the ancient and crazy timberframe And indeed the consideration of accidents by fire excepted this sort of roofing is much more eligible than tiles For shingles well seasoned and cleft from quartered timber never warp nor let in drifting snow nor do they shiver with frost nor are they liable to be blown off like tiles but when well nailed down last for a long period as experience has shown us in this place where those that face to the north are known to have endured untouched by undoubted tradition for more than a century  Considering the size of the church and the extent of the parish the churchyard is very scanty and especially as all wish to be buried on the southside which is become such a mass of mortality that no person can be there interred without disturbing or displacing the bones of his ancestors There is reason to suppose that it once was larger and extended to what is now the vicarage court and garden because many human bones have been dug up in those parts several yards without the present limits At the east end are a few graves yet none till very lately on the northside but as two or three families of best repute have begun to bury in that quarter prejudice may wear out by degrees and their example be followed by the rest of the neighbourhood  north view of Selborne church  Pl VII Pa  North View of SELBORNE CHURCH  S H Grimm del P Mazell sculp  Published    by B White Son  In speaking of the church I have all along talked of the east and westend as if the chancel stood exactly true to those points of the compass but this is by no means the case for the fabric bears so much to the north of the east that the four corners of the tower and not the four sides stand to the four cardinal points The best method of accounting for this deviation seems to be that the workmen who probably were employed in the longest days endeavoured to set the chancels to the rising of the sun  Close by the church at the west end stands the vicaragehouse an old but roomy and convenient edifice It faces very agreeably to the morning sun and is divided from the village by a neat and cheerful court According to the manner of old times the hall was open to the roof and so continued probably till the vicars became familymen and began to want more conveniencies when they flung a floor across and by partitions divided the space into chambers In this hall we remember a date some time in the reign of  Elizabeth  it was over the door that leads to the stairs  Behind the house is a garden of an irregular shape but well laid out whose terrace commands so romantic and picturesque a prospect that the first master in landscape might contemplate it with pleasure and deem it an object well worthy of his pencil  LETTER V  IN the churchyard of this village is a  yewtree  whose aspect bespeaks it to be of a great age it seems to have seen several centuries and is probably coeval with the church and therefore may be deemed an antiquity the body is squat short and thick and measures twentythree feet in the girth supporting an head of suitable extent to it's bulk This is a male tree which in the spring sheds clouds of dust and fills the atmosphere around with it's farina  As far as we have been able to observe the males of this species become much larger than the females and it has so fallen out that most of the yewtrees in the churchyards of this neighbourhood are males but this must have been matter of mere accident since men when they first planted yews little dreamed that there were sexes in trees  In a yard in the midst of the street till very lately grew a middlesized female tree of the same species which commonly bore great crops of berries By the high winds usually prevailing about the autumnal equinox these berries then ripe were blown down into the road where the hogs ate them And it was very remarkable that though barrowhogs and young sows found no inconvenience from this food yet milchsows often died after such a repast a circumstance that can be accounted for only by supposing that the latter being much exhausted and hungry devoured a larger quantity  While mention is making of the bad effects of yewberries it may be proper to remind the unwary that the twigs and leaves of yew though eaten in a very small quantity are certain death to horses and cows and that in a few minutes An horse tied to a yewhedge or to a faggotstack of dead yew shall be found dead before the owner can be aware that any danger is at hand and the writer has been several times a sorrowful witness to losses of this kind among his friends and in the island of  Ely  had once the mortification to see nine young steers or bullocks of his own all lying dead in an heap from browzing a little on an hedge of yew in an old garden into which they had broken in snowy weather Even the clippings of a yewhedge have destroyed a whole dairy of cows when thrown inadvertently into a yard And yet sheep and turkies and as parkkeepers say deer will crop these trees with impunity  Some intelligent persons assert that the branches of yew while  green  are not noxious and that they will kill only when  dead  and  withered  by lacerating the stomach but to this assertion we cannot by any means assent because among the number of cattle that we have known fall victims to this deadly food not one has been found when it was opened but had a lump of  green  yew in it's paunch True it is that yewtrees stand for twenty years or more in a field and no bad consequences ensue but at some time or other cattle either from wantonness when full or from hunger when empty from both which circumstances we have seen them perish will be meddling to their certain destruction the yew seems to be a very improper tree for a pasturefield  Antiquaries seem much at a loss to determine at what period this tree first obtained a place in churchyards A statute passed AD and  Edward  I the title of which is  "Ne rector  arbores in cemeterio prosternat"  Now if it is recollected that we seldom see any other very large or ancient tree in a churchyard but yews this statute must have principally related to this species of tree and consequently their being planted in churchyards is of much more ancient date than the year  As to the use of these trees possibly the more respectable parishioners were buried under their shade before the improper custom was introduced of burying within the body of the church where the living are to assemble  Deborah Rebekah  's nurse  Gen xxxv  was buried under an oak the most honourable place of interment probably next to the cave of  Machpelah  Gen xxiii  which seems to have been appropriated to the remains of the patriarchal family alone  The farther use of yewtrees might be as a screen to churches by their thick foliage from the violence of winds perhaps also for the purpose of archery the best long bows being made of that material and we do not hear that they are planted in the churchyards of other parts of  Europe  where long bows were not so much in use They might also be placed as a shelter to the congregation assembling before the churchdoors were opened and as an emblem of mortality by their funereal appearance In the south of  England  every churchyard almost has it's tree and some two but in the north we understand few are to be found  The idea of R C that the  yewtree  afforded it's branches instead of palms for the processions on  PalmSunday  is a good one and deserves attention  See Gent Mag Vol L p  LETTER VI  THE living of  Selborne  was a very small vicarage but being in the patronage of  Magdalencollege  in the university of  Oxford  that society endowed it with the great tithes of  Selborne  more than a century ago and since the year again with the great tithes of  Oakhanger  called  Bene's parsonage  so that together it is become a respectable piece of preferment to which one of the fellows is always presented The vicar holds the great tithes by lease under the college The great disadvantage of this living is that it has not one foot of glebe near home  At  Bene  's or  Bin's parsonage  there is a house and stout barn and seven acres of glebe  Bene  's parsonage is three miles from the church    ITS PAYMENTS ARE     £  s  d  King's books        Yearly tenths      ½  Yearly procurations for  Blackmore  and  Oakhanger Chap  with acquit        Selborne  procurations and acquit        I am unable to give a complete list of the vicars of this parish till towards the end of the reign of queen  Elizabeth  from which period the registers furnish a regular series  In  Domesday  we find thus  "De isto manerio dono dedit Rex  Radfredo  presbytero dimidiam hidam cum ecclesia"  So that before  Domesday  which was compiled between the years and here was an officiating minister at this place  After this among my documents I find occasional mention of a vicar here and there the first is  Roger  instituted in  In  John Lynne  was vicar of  Selborne  In  Hugo Tybbe  was vicar  The presentations to the vicarage of  Selborne  generally ran in the name of the prior and the convent but  Tybbe  was presented by prior  John Wynechestre  only  June    William Fisher  vicar of  Selborne  resigned to  Miles Peyrson    William White  appears to have been vicar to this time Of this person there is nothing remarkable but that he hath made a regular entry twice in the register of  Selborne  of the funeral of  Thomas Cowper  bishop of  Winchester  as if he had been buried at  Selborne  yet this learned prelate who died was buried at  Winchester  in the cathedral near the episcopal throne  See  Godwin  de praesulibus folio  Cant  page      Richard Boughton  vicar    William Inkforbye  vicar  May    Thomas Phippes  vicar  June    Ralph Austine  vicar  July    John Longworth  This unfortunate gentleman living in the time of  Cromwell  's usurpation was deprived of his preferment for many years probably because he would not take the league and covenant for I observe that his fatherinlaw the Reverend  Jethro Beal  rector of  Faringdon  which is the next parish enjoyed his benefice during the whole of that unhappy period  Longworth  after he was dispossessed retired to a little tenement about one hundred and fifty yards from the church where he earned a  small pittance by the practice of physic During those dismal times it was not uncommon for the deposed clergy to take up a medical character as was the case in particular I know with the Reverend Mr  Yalden  rector of  Compton  near  Guildford  in the county of  Surrey  Vicar  Longworth  used frequently to mention to his sons who told it to my relations that the  Sunday  after his deprivation his puritanical successor stepped into the pulpit with no small petulance and exultation and began his sermon from  Psalm  xx  "  They are brought down and fallen but we are risen and stand upright  "  This person lived to be restored in and continued vicar for eighteen years but was so impoverished by his misfortunes that he left the vicaragehouse and premises in a very abject and dilapidated state  July    Richard Byfield  who left eighty pounds by will the interest to be applied to apprentice out poor children but this money lent on private security was in danger of being lost and the bequest remained in an unsettled state for near twenty years till so that little or no advantage was derived from it About the year it was again in the utmost danger by the failure of a borrower but by prudent management has since been raised to one hundred pounds stock in the three per cents reduced The trustees are the vicar and the renters or owners of  Temple Priory Grange Blackmore  and  Oakhangerhouse  for the time being This gentleman seemed inclined to have put the vicarial premises in a comfortable state and began by building a solid stone wall round the frontcourt and another in the lower yard between that and the neighbouring garden but was interrupted by death from fulfilling his laudable intentions  April    Barnabas Long  became vicar  June  This living was now in such low estimation in  Magdalencollege  that it descended to a junior fellow  Gilbert White  MA who was instituted to it in the thirtyfirst year of his age At his first coming he ceiled the chancel and also floored and wainscoted the parlour and hall which before were paved with stone and had naked walls he enlarged the kitchen and brewhouse and dug a cellar and well he also built a large new barn in the lower yard removed the hovels in the front court which he laid out in walks and borders and entirely planned the back garden before a rude field with a stonepit in the midst of it By his will he gave and bequeathed  "the sum of forty pounds to be laid out in the most necessary repairs of the church that is in strengthening and securing such parts as seem decaying and dangerous"  With this sum two large buttresses were erected to support the east end of the south wall of the church and the gableend wall of the west end of the south aile was new built from the ground  By his will also he gave  "One hundred pounds to be laid out on lands the yearly rents whereof shall be employed in teaching the poor children of  Selbourn  parish to read and write and say their prayers and catechism and to sew and knitand be under the direction of his executrix as long as she lives and after her under the direction of such of his children and their issue as shall live in or within five miles of the said parish and on failure of any such then under the direction of the vicar of  Selbourn  for the time being but still to the uses abovenamed"  With this sum was purchased of  Thomas Turville  of  Hawkeley  in the county of  Southampton  yeoman and  Hannah  his wife  two closes  of freehold land commonly called  Collier  's containing by estimation  eleven  acres lying in  Hawkeley  aforesaid These closes are let at this time on lease at the rate of three pounds by the year  This vicar also gave by will  two hundred pounds  towards the repairs of the highways  "Such legacies were very common in former times before any effectual laws were made for the repairs of highways"  Sir John Cuhum s Hawsted p  in the parish of  Selborne  That sum was carefully and judiciously laid out in the summer of the year by his son  John White  who made a solid and firm causey from  Roodgreen  all down  Honeylane  to a farm called  Oakwoods  where the sandy soil begins This miry and gulfy lane was chosen as worthy of repair because it leads to the forest and thence through the  Holt  to the town of  Farnham  in  Surrey  the only market in those days for men who had wheat to sell in this neighbourhood This causey was so deeply bedded with stone so properly raised above the level of the soil and so well drained that it has in some degree withstood fiftyfour years of neglect and abuse and might with moderate attention be rendered a solid and comfortable road The space from  Roodgreen  to  Oakwoods  measures about three quarters of a mile  In  William Henry Cane  BD became vicar and among several alterations and repairs newbuilt the back front of the vicaragehouse  On  February    Duncombe Bristowe  DD was instituted to this living What benefactions this vicar bestowed on the parish will be best explained by the following passages from his will  "  Item  I hereby give and bequeath to the minister and churchwardens of the parish of  Selbourn  in the county of  Southampton  a mahogany table which I have ordered to be made for the celebration of the Holy Communion and also the sum of  thirty pounds in trust to be applied in manner following that is ten pounds towards the charge of erecting a gallery at the west end of the church and ten pounds to be laid out for cloathing and such like necessaries among the poor and especially among the ancient and infirm of the said parish and the remaining ten pounds to be distributed in bread at twenty shillings a week at the discretion of  John White  esq or any of his family who shall be resident in the said parish"  On  November    Andrew Etty  BD became vicar Among many useful repairs he newroofed the body of the vicaragehouse and wainscoted up to the bottom of the windows the whole of the chancel to the neatness and decency of which he always paid the most exact attention  On  September    Christopher Taylor  BD was inducted into the vicarage of  Selborne  LETTER VII  I SHALL now proceed to the  Priory  which is undoubtedly the most interesting part of our history  The  Priory  of  Selborne  was founded by  Peter de la Roche  or  de Rupibus  See  Godwin  de Praesulibus Anglia Folio London p  one of those accomplished foreigners that resorted to the court of king  John  where they were usually caressed and met with a more favourable reception than ought in prudence to have been shown by any monarch to strangers This adventurer was a  Poictevin  by birth had been bred to arms in his youth and distinguished by knighthood Historians all agree not to speak very favourably of this remarkable man they allow that he was possessed of courage and fine abilities but then they charge him with arbitrary principles and violent conduct By his insinuating manners he soon rose high in the favour of  John  and in early in the reign of that prince was appointed bishop of  Winchester  In he became lord chief justiciary of  England  the first magistrate in the state and a kind of viceroy on whom depended all the civil affairs in the kingdom After the death of  John  and during the minority of his son  Henry  this prelate took upon him the entire management of the realm and was soon appointed protector of the king and kingdom  The barons saw with indignation a stranger possessed of all the power and influence to part of which they thought they had a claim they therefore entered into an association against him and determined to wrest some of that authority from him which he had so unreasonably usurped The bishop discerned the storm at a distance and prudently resolving to give way to that torrent of envy which he knew not how to withstand withdrew quietly to the Holy Land where he resided some time  At this juncture a very small part of  Palestine  remained in the hands of the Christians they had been by  Saladine  dispossessed of  Jerusalem  and all the internal parts near forty years before and with difficulty maintained some maritime towns and garrisons yet the busy and enterprising spirit of  de Rupibus  could not be at rest he distinguished himself by the splendour and magnificence of his expenses and amused his mind by strengthening fortresses and castles and by removing and endowing of churches Before his expedition to the east he had signalized himself as a founder of convents and as a benefactor to hospitals and monasteries  In the year he returned again to  England  and the very next year in began to build and endow the PRIORY of SELBORNE As this great work followed so close upon his return it is not improbable that it was the result of a vow made during his voyage and especially as it was dedicated to the  Virgin Mary  Why the bishop made choice of  Selborne  for the scene of his munificence can never be determined now it can only be said that the parish was in his diocese and lay almost midway between  Winchester  and  Farnham  or  South Waltham  and  Farnham  from either of which places he could without much trouble overlook his workmen and observe what progress they made and that the situation was retired with a stream running by it and  sequestered from the world amidst woods and meadows and so far proper for the site of a religious house  The institution at  Selborne  was a priory of  BlackCanons  of the order of  St Agustine  called also  CanonsRegular RegularCanons  were such as lived in a conventual manner under one roof had a common refectory and dormitary and were bound by vows to observe the rules and statutes of their order in fine they were a kind of religious whose discipline was less rigid than the  monks  The chief rule of these  canons  was that of  St Augustine  who was constituted bishop of  Hippo  AD but they were not brought into  England  till after the conquest and seem not to have obtained the appellation of  Augustine canons  till some years after Their habit was a long black  cassack  with a white  rocket  over it and over that a black  cloak and hood  The monks were always shaved but these canons were their hair and beards and caps on their heads There were of these  canons  and women of the same order called  Canonesses  about houses    The first person with whom the founder treated about the purchase of land was  Jacobus de Achangre  or  Ochangre  a gentleman of property who resided at that hamlet and as appears at the house now called  Oakhangerhouse  With him he agreed for a croft or little close of land known by the name of  La liega  or  La lyge  which was to be the immediate site of the  Priory  De Achangre  also accommodated the bishop at the same instant with three more adjoining crofts which for a time was all the footing that this institution obtained in the parish The seller in the conveyance says  "Warantizabimus defendemus et aequietabimus  contra omnes gentes  "  viz  "We will warrant the thing sold against all claims from any quarter"  In modern conveyancing this would be termed a covenant for  further assurance  Afterwards is added  "Pro hac autem donacione c dedit mihi pred Episcopus sexdecem marcas argenti in  Gersumam  "  i e  "the bishop gave me sixteen silver marks as a consideration for the thing purchased"  As the grant from  Jac de Achangre  was without date  The custom of affixing dates to deeds was not become general in the reign of  Henry  III  and the next is circumstanced in the same manner we cannot say exactly what interval there was between the two purchases but we find that  Jacobus de Nortun  a neighbouring gentleman also soon sold to the bishop of  Winehester  some adjoining grounds through which our stream passes that the priory might be accommodated with a  mill  which was a common necessary appendage to every manor he also allowed access to these lands by a road for carts and waggons  "  Jacobus de Nortun  concedit  Petro Winton  episcopo totum cursum aque que descèndit de  Molendino de Durton  us{que} ad boscum  Will Mauduit  et croftam terre vocat  Edriche croft  cum extensione ejusdem et abuttamentis ad fundandam domum religiosam de ordine  Sti Augustini  Concedit etiam viam ad carros et caretas"  c This vale down which runs the brook is now called the  Long Lithe or Lythe  Bating the following particular expression this grant runs much in the style of the former  "Dedit mihi episcopus predictus triginta quinque marcas argenti  ad me acquietandum versus Judaeos  "  that is  "the bishop advanced me thirtyfive marks of silver to pay my debts to the jews who were then the only lenders of money"  Finding himself still streightened for room the founder applied to his royal master  Henry  who was graciously pleased to bestow certain lands in the manor at  Selborne  on the new priory of his favourite minister These grounds had been the property of  Stephen de Lucy  and abutting upon the narrow limits of the convent became a very commodious and agreeable acquisition This grant I find was made on  March  the th in the eighteenth year of  Henry viz  being two years after the foundation of the  monastery The royal donor bestowed his favour with a good grace by adding to it almost every immunity and privilege that could have been specified in the lawlanguage of the times  "Quare volumus prior c habeant totam terram c cum omnibus libertatibus in bosco et plano in viis et semitis pratis et pascuis aquis et piscariis infra burgum et extra burgum cum soka et saca Thol et

clausuris parcorum et omni carcio et sumagio et domor regal edificatione et omnimoda reparatione et cum omnibus aliis libertatibus"  This grant was made out by  Richard  bishop of  Chichester  then chancellor at the town of  Northampton  before the lord chief justiciary who was the founder himself  The  charter  of foundation of the  Priory  dated comes next in order to be considered but being of some length I shall not interrupt my narrative by placing it here and therefore refer the reader to the Appendix N  o  I This my copy taken from the original I have compared with  Dugdale  's copy and find that they perfectly agree except that in the latter the preamble and the names of the witnesses are omitted Yet I think it proper to quote a passage from this charter  "Et ipsa domus religiosa  a cujuslibet alterius domûs religiosae subjectione libera  permaneat et in omnibus  absoluta  "  to shew how much  Dugdale  was mistaken when he inserted  Selborne  among the  alien priories  forgetting that this disposition of the convent contradicted the grant that he had  published In the  Monasticon Anglicanum  in English p is part of his catalogue of  alien priories  suppressed  Henry  V  viz  where may be seen as follows  S  Sele Sussex  SELEBURN  Shirburn  This appeared to me from the first to have been an oversight before I had seen my authentic evidences For  priories alien  a few  conventual  ones excepted were little better than  granges  to foreign abbies and their priors little more than bailiffs removeable at will whereas the  priory  of  Selborne  possessed the valuable estates and manors of  Selborne Achangre Norton Brompden Bassinges Basingstoke  and  Natele  and the prior challenged the right of  Pillory Thurcet  and  Fureas  and every manerial privilege  I find next a grant from  Jo de Venur  or  Venuz  to the prior of  Selborne    "de tota mora a moor or bog ubi  Beme  oritur usque ad campum vivarii et de prato voc  Sydenmeade  cum abutt et de cursu aque molendini"  And also a grant in reversion  "unius virgate terre"  a yard land in  Aehangre  at the death of  Richard Actedene  his sister's husband who had no child He was to present a pair of gloves of one penny value to the prior and canons to be given annually by the said  Richard  and to quit all claim to the said lands in reversion provided the prior and canons would engage annually to pay to the king through the hands of his bailiffs of  Aulton  ten shillings at four quarterly payments  "pro omnibus serviciis consuetudinibus exactionibus et demandis"  This  Jo de Venur  was a man of property at  Oakhanger  and lived probably at the spot now called  Chapelfarm  The grant bears date the th year of the reign of  Henry  III  viz    It would be tedious to enumerate every little grant for lands or tenements that might be produced from my vouchers I shall therefore pass over all such for the present and conclude this letter with a remark that must strike every thinking person with some degree of wonder No sooner had a monastic institution got a footing but the neighbourhood began to be touched with a secret and religious awe Every person round was desirous to promote so good a work and either by sale by grant or by gift in reversion was ambitious of appearing a benefactor They who had not lands to spare gave roads to accommodate the infant foundation The religious were not backward in keeping up this pious propensity which they observed so readily influenced the breasts of men Thus did the more opulent monasteries add house to house and field to field and by degrees manor to manor till at last  "there was no place left"  but every district around became appropriated to the purposes of their founders and every precinct was drawn into the vortex  LETTER VIII  OUR forefathers in this village were no doubt as busy and bustling and as important as ourselves yet have their names and transactions been forgotten from century to century and have sunk into oblivion nor has this happened only to the vulgar but even to men remarkable and famous in their generation I was led into this train of thinking by finding in my vouchers that Sir  Adam Gurdon  was an inhabitant of  Selborne  and a man of the first rank and property in the parish By Sir  Adam Gurdon  I would be understood to mean that leading and accomplished malecontent in the  Mountfort  faction who distinguished himself by his daring conduct in the reign of  Henry  III The first that we hear of this person in my papers is that with two others he was bailiff of  Alton  before the sixteenth of  Henry  III  viz  about and then not knighted Who  Gurdon  was and whence he came does not appear yet there is reason to suspect that he was originally a mere soldier of fortune who had raised himself by marrying women of property The name of  Gurdon  does not seem to be known in the south but there is a name so like it in an adjoining kingdom and which belongs to two or three noble families that it is probable this remarkable person was a  North Briton  and the more so since the Christian name of  Adam  is a distinguished one to this day among the family of the  Gordons  But be this as it may Sir  Adam Gurdon  has been noticed by all the writers of  English  history for his bold disposition and disaffected  spirit in that he not only figured during the successful rebellion of  Leicester  but kept up the war after the defeat and death of that baron's entrenching himself in the woods of  Hampshire  towards the town of  Farnham  After the battle of  Evesham  in which  Mountfort  fell in the year  Gurdon  might not think it safe to return to his house for fear of a surprise but cautiously fortified himself amidst the forests and woodlands with which he was so well acquainted Prince  Edward  desirous of putting an end to the troubles which had so long harassed the kingdom pursued the archrebel into his fastnesses attacked his camp leaped over the entrenchments and singling out  Gurdon  ran him down wounded him and took him prisoner  M Paris p Triveti Annale    There is not perhaps in all history a more remarkable instance of command of temper and magnanimity than this before us that a young prince in the moment of victory when he had the fell adversary of the crown and royal family at his mercy should be able to withhold his hand from that vengeance which the vanquished so well deserved A cowardly disposition would have been blinded by resentment but this gallant heirapparent saw at once a method of converting a most desperate foe into a lasting friend He raised the fallen veteran from the ground he pardoned him he admitted him into his confidence and introduced him to the queen then lying at  Guildford  that very evening  M Paris p Triveti Annale  This unmerited and unexpected lenity melted the heart of the rugged  Gurdon  at once he became in an instant a loyal and useful subject trusted and employed in matters of moment by  Edward  when king and confided in till the day of his death  LETTER IX  IT has been hinted in a former letter that Sir  Adam Gurdon  had availed himself by marrying women of property By my evidences it appears that he had three wives and probably in the following order  Constantia Ameria  and  Agnes  The first of these ladies who was the companion of his middle life seems to have been a person of considerable fortune which she inherited from  Thomas Makerel  a gentleman of  Selborne  who was either her father or uncle The second  Ameria  calls herself the quondam wife of Sir  Adam  "quae fui uxor"  c and talks of her sons under age Now  Gurdon  had no son and beside  Agnes  in another document says  "Ego  Agnes  quondam uxor Domini  Adae Gurdon  in pura et ligea viduitate mea"  but  Gurdon  could not leave two widows and therefore it seems probable that he had been divorced from  Ameria  who afterwards married and had sons By  Agnes  Sir  Adam  had a daughter  Johanna  who was his heiress to whom  Agnes  in her lifetime surrendered part of her jointurehe had also a bastard son  Sir  Adam  seems to have inhabited the house now called  Temple  lying about two miles east of the church which had been the property of  Thomas Makerel  In the year he petitioned the prior of  Selborne  in his own name and that of his wife  Constantia  only for leave to build him an  oratory  in his manorhouse  "in curia sua"  Licenses of this sort were frequently obtained by men of fortune and rank from the bishop of the diocese the archbishop and sometimes as I have  view of Selborne  Pl VIII Pa  TEMPLE in the Parish of SELBORNE  S H Grimm del D Lerpiniere sculp  Published    by B White Son  seen instances from the pope not only for conveniencesake and on account of distance and the badness of the roads but as a matter of state and distinction Why the owner should apply to the  prior  in preference to the  bishop  of the  diocese  and how the former became competent to such a grant I cannot say but that the priors of  Selborne  did take that privilege is plain because some years afterward in Prior  Richard  granted to  Henry Waterford  and his wife  Nicholaa  a license to build an  oratory  in their courthouse  "curia fua  de Waterford  "  in which they might celebrate divine service saving the rights of the mother church of  Basynges  Yet all the while the prior of  Selborne  grants with such reserve and caution as if in doubt of his power and leaves  Gurdon  and his lady answerable in future to the bishop or his ordinary or to the vicar for the time being in case they should infringe the rights of the mother church of  Selborne  The manorhouse called  Temple  is at present a single building running in length from south to north and has been occupied as a common farm house from time immemorial The south end is modern and consists of a brewhouse and then a kitchen The middle part is an hall twentyseven feet in length and nineteen feet in breadth and has been formerly open to the top but there is now a floor above it and also a chimney in the western wall The roofing consists of strong massive rafterwork ornamented with carved roses I have often looked for the  lamb  and  flag  the arms of the  knights templars  without success but in one corner found a fox with a goose on his back so coarsely executed that it required some attention to make out the device  Beyond the hall to the north is a small parlour with a vast heavy stone chimneypiece and at the end of all the  chapel  or  oratory  whose massive thick walls and narrow windows at once bespeak  great antiquity This room is only sixteen feet by sixteen feet eight inches and full seventeen feet nine inches in height The ceiling is formed of vast joists placed only five or six inches apart Modern delicacy would not much approve of such a place of worship for it has at present much more the appearance of a dungeon than of a room fit for the reception of people of condition For the outside I refer the reader to the plate in which Mr  Grimm  has represented it with his usual accuracy The field on which this oratory abuts is still called Chapelfield The situation of this house is very particular for it stands upon the immediate verge of a steep abrupt hill  Not many years since this place was used for an hopkiln and was divided into two stories by a loft part of which remains at present and makes it convenient for peat and turf with which it is stowed  view of Selborne  Pl IX Pa  The PLEYSTOW vulg the PLESTOR  sculp  Published    by B White Son  LETTER X  THE Priory at times was much obliged to  Gurdon  and his family As  Sir Adam  began to advance in years he found his mind influenced by the prevailing opinion of the reasonableness and efficacy of prayers for the dead and therefore in conjunction with his wife  Constantia  in the year granted to the prior and convent of  Selborne  all his right and claim to a certain place  placea  called  La Pleystow  in the village aforesaid  "in  liberam puram  et  perpetuam elemosinam  "  This  Pleystow  In  Saxon  or  viz  Plegestow  or  Plegstow    locus ludorum  or playplace is a level area near the church of about fortyfour yards by thirtysix and is known now by the name of the  Plestor  At this juncture probably the vast oak mentioned p was planted by the prior as an ornament to his new acquired market place According to this supposition the oak was aged years when blown down    It continues still as it was in old times to be the scene of recreation for the youths and children of the neighbourhood and impresses an idea on the mind that this village even in  Saxon  times could not be the most abject of places when the inhabitants thought proper to asign so spacious a spot for the sports and amusements of it's young people  For more circumstances respecting the  Plestor  see Letter II to Mr  Pennant    As soon as the prior became possessed of this piece of ground he procured a charter for a  market  Bishop  Tanner  in his  Notitia Monastica  has made a mistake respecting the  market  and  sair  at  Selborne  for in his references to  Dodsworth  cart  Hen  III m he says  "  De mercatu et seria de Seleburn  "  But this reference is wrong for instead of  Seleburn  it proves that the place there meant was  Lekeborne  or  Legeborne  in the county of  Lincoln  This error was copied from the index of the Cat MSS Angl It does not appear that there ever was a  chartered  fair at  Selborne  For several particulars respecting the present fair at  Selborne  see Letter XXVI of these Antiquities  from king  Henry  III and began to erect houses and stalls "  seldas  " around it From this period  Selborne  became a market town but how long it enjoyed that privilege does not appear At the same time  Gurdon  reserved to himself and his heirs a way through the said  Plestor  to a tenement and some crofts at the upper end abutting on the south corner of the churchyard This was in old days the manerial house of the street manor though now a poor cottage and is known at present by the modern name of  Elliot's Sir Adam  also did for the health of his own soul and that of his wife  Constantia  their predecessors and successors grant to the prior and canons quiet possession of all the tenements and gardens "  curtillagia  " which they had built and laid out on the lands in  Selborne  on which he and his vassals "  homines  " had undoubted right of common and moreover did grant to the convent the full privilege of that right of common and empowered the religious to build tenements and make gardens along the king's highway in the village of  Selborne  From circumstances put together it appears that the above were the first grants obtained by the Priory in the village of  Selborne  after it had subsisted about thirtynine years moreover they explain the nature of the mixed manor still remaining in and about the village where one field or tenement shall belong to  Magdalencollege  college  in the university of  Oxford  and the next to  Norton Powlet  esq of  Rotherfield  house and so down the whole street The case was that the whole was once the property of  Gurdon  till he made his grants to the convent since which some belongs to the successors of  Gurdon  in the manor and some to the college and this is the occasion of the strange jumble of property It is remarkable that the tenement and crofts which Sir  Adam  reserved at the time of granting the Plestor should still remain a part of the  Gurdonmanor  though so desirable an addition to the vicarage that is not as yet possessed of one inch of glebe at home but of late  viz  in  January    Magdalencollege  purchased that little estate which is lifeholding in reversion for the generous purpose of bestowing it and it's lands being twelve acres three of which abut on the churchyard and vicaragegarden as an improvement hereafter to the living and an eligible advantage to future incumbents  The year after  Gurdon  had bestowed the  Plestor  on the Priory  viz  in  Henry  III king of  England  died and was succeeded by his son  Edward  This magnanimous prince continued his regard for Sir  Adam  whom he esteemed as a brave man and made him  warden  "  custos  " of the forest of  Wolmer  Since the letters respecting  Wolmerforest  and  Aylesholt  from p to were printed the author has been favoured with the following extracts  In the "Act of Resumption Hen VII" it was provided that it be not prejudicial to  "  Harry  at  Lode  ranger of our forest

hang to this appointment yet are there reasons why it might be highly acceptable and in a few reigns after it was given to princes of the blood  See Letter II of these Antiquities  In old days gentry resided more at home on their estates and having fewer resources of elegant indoor amusement spent most of their leisure hours in the field  and the pleasures of the chase A large domain therefore at little more than a mile distance and well stocked with game must have been a very eligible acquisition affording him influence as well as entertainment and especially as the manerial house of  Temple  by its exalted situation could command a view of near twothirds of the forest  That  Gurdon  who had lived some years the life of an outlaw and at the head of an army of insurgents was for a considerable time in high rebellion against his sovereign should have been guilty of some outrages and should have committed some depredations is by no means matter of wonder Accordingly we find a  distringas  against him ordering him to restore to the bishop of  Winchester  some of the temporalities of that see which he had taken by violence and detained viz some lands in  Hocheleye  and a mill  Hocheleye  now spelt  Hawkley  is in the hundred of  Selborne  and has a mill at this day  By a  breve  or writ from the king he is also enjoined to readmit the bishop of  Winchester  and his tenants of the parish and town of  Farnham  to pasture their horses and other  larger  cattle "  averia  " in the forest of  Wolmer  as had been the usage from time immemorial This writ is dated in the tenth year of the reign of  Edward  viz  All the king's writs directed to  Gurdon  are addressed in the following manner  "  Edwardus  Dei gratia c dilecto et fideli suo  Ade Gurdon  salutem"  and again  "Custodi foreste sue de  Wolvemere  "  In the year a quarrel between the crews of an  English  and a  Norman  ship about some trifle brought on by degrees such serious consequences that in a war broke out between the  two nations The  French  king  Philip the Hardy  gained some advantages in  Gascony  and not content with those threatened  England  with an invasion and by a sudden attempt took and burnt  Dover  Upon this emergency  Edward  sent a writ to  Gurdon  ordering him and four others to enlist three thousand soldiers in the counties of  Surrey Dorset  and  Wiltshire  ablebodied men  "tam sagittare quam balistare potentes"  and to see that they were marched by the feast of  All Saints  to  Winchelsea  there to be embarked aboard the king's transports  The occasion of this armament appears also from a summons to the bishop of  Winchester  to parliament part of which I shall transcribe on account of the insolent menace which is said therein to have been denounced against the  English  language  "qualiter rex  Franciae  de terra nostra  Gascon  nos fraudulenter et cautelose decepit eam nobis nequiter detinendo vero predictis fraude et nequitia non contentus ad expugnationem regni nostri classe maxima et bellatorum copiosa multitudine congregatis cum quibus regnum nostrum et regni ejusdem incolas hostiliter jam invasurus  linguam Anglicam  si concepte iniquitatis proposito detestabili potestas correspondeat quod Deus avertat  omnino de terra delere proponit  "  Dated th September in the year of king  Edward  's reign xxiii  Reg  Wynton Stratford  but query  Stratford  for  Stratford  was not bishop of  Winton  till near thirty years afterwards    The above are the last traces that I can discover of  Gurdon  's appearing and acting in public The first notice that my evidences give of him is that in being the th of  Henry  III he was the king's bailiff with others for the town of  Alton  Now  from to is a space of sixtythree years a long period for one man to be employed in active life Should any one doubt whether all these particulars can relate to one and the same person I should wish him to attend to the following reasons why they might In the first place the documents from the priory mention but one Sir  Adam Gurdon  who had no son lawfully begotten and in the next we are to recollect that he must have probably been a man of uncommon vigour both of mind and body since no one unsupported by such accomplishments could have engaged in such adventures or could have borne up against the difficulties which he sometimes must have encountered and moreover we have modern instances of persons that have maintained their abilities for near that period  Were we to suppose  Gurdon  to be only twenty years of age in in he would be eightythree after which advanced period it could not be expected that he should live long From the silence therefore of my evidences it seems probable that this extraordinary person finished his life in peace not long after at his mansion of  Temple Gurdon  's seal had for its devicea man with an helmet on his head drawing a crossbow the legend  "  Sigillum Ade de Gurdon  "  his arms were  "Goulis iii floures argent issant de testes de leopards  From the collection of  Thomas Martin  Esq in the Antiquarian Repertory p N  o  XXXI  "  If the stout and unsubmitting spirit of  Gurdon  could be so much influenced by the belief and superstition of the times much more might the hearts of his ladies and daughter And accordingly we find that  Ameria  by the consent and advice of her sons though said to be all under age makes a grant for ever of some lands  down by the stream at  Durton  and also of her right of the common of  Durton  itself  Durton  now called  Dorton  is still a common for the copyholders of  Selborne  manor    Johanna  the daughter and heiress of Sir  Adam  was married I find to  Richard Achard  she also grants to the prior and convent lands and tenements in the village of  Selborne  which her father obtained from  Thomas Makerel  and also all her goods and chattels in  Selborne  for the consideration of two hundred pounds sterling This last business was transacted in the first year of  Edward  II viz It has been observed before that  Gurdon  had a natural son this person was called by the name of  John Dastard  alias  Wastard  but more probably  Bastard  since bastardy in those days was not esteemed any disgrace though dastardy was esteemed the greatest He was married to  Gunnorie Duncun  and had a tenement and some land granted him in  Selborne  by his sister  Johanna  LETTER XI  THE  Knights Templars  The  MILITARY ORDERS  of the  RELIGIOUS  The  Knights Hospitalars  of  St John of Jerusalem  afterwards called  Knights of Rhodes  now of  Malta  came into  England  about the year  Hen  I  The  Knights Templars  came into  England  pretty early in  Stephen  's reign which commenced The order was dissolved in and their estates given by act of Parliament to the  Hospitalars  in all in  Edw  II though many of their estates were never actually enjoyed by the said  Hospitalars  Vid Tanner  p xxiv x  The  commandries  of the  Hospitalars  and  preceptories  of  Templars  were each subordinate to the principal house of their respective religion in  London  Although these are the different denominations which  Tanner  at p xxviii assigns to the cells of these different orders yet throughout the work very frequent instances occur of  preceptories  attributed to the  Hospitalars  and if in some passages of  Notitia Monast commandries  are attributed to the  Templars  it is only where the place afterwards became the property of the  Hospitalars  and so is there indifferently styled  preceptory  or  commandry  see p But to account for the first observed inaccuracy it is probable the  preceptories  of the  Templars  when given to the  Hospitalars  were still vulgarly however called by their old name of  preceptories  whereas in propriety the societies of the  Hospitalars  were indeed as has been said  commandries  And such deviation from the strictness of expression in this case might occasion those societies of  Hospitalars  also to be indifferently called  preceptories  which had  originally  been vested in  them  having never belonged to the  Templars  at allSee in  Archer  p  Tanner  p col note  e  It is observable that the very statute for the dissolution of the  Hospitalars  holds the same language for there in the enumeration of particulars occur  "  commandries preceptories  "  Codex  p Now this intercommunity of names and that in an act of parliament too made some of our ablest antiquaries look upon a  preceptory  and  commandry  as strictly synonymous accordingly we find  Camden  in his  Britannia  explaining  praeceptoria  in the text by a  commandry  in the margin p  J L  Commandry  a manor or chief messuage with lands c belonging to the priory of St  John of Jerusalem  and he who had the government of such house was called the  commander  who could not dispose of it but to the use of the priory only taking thence his own sustenance according to his degree who was usually a brother of the same priory  Cowell  He adds confounding these with  preceptories  they are in many places termed  Temples  as  Temple Brueve  in  Lincolnshire  c  Preceptories  were possessed by the more eminent sort of  Templars  whom the chief master created and called  Praeceptores Templi Cowell  who refers to  Stephens  de Jurisd lib c num  Placita de juratis et assis coram Salom de Roff et soeiis suis justic Itiner apud Wynton c anno regni R Edwardi fil Reg Hen octavo  "et Magr Milicie Templi in Angl ht emendassē panis suis cerevisiae in  Sodington  nescint q  o  war etet magist Milicie Templi nōn vēn iō distr"  Chapterhouse Westminster  who have been mentioned in a former letter had considerable property in  Selborne  and also a  preceptory  at  Sudington  now called  Southington  a hamlet lying one mile to  the east of the village Bishop  Tanner  mentions only two such houses of the  Templars  in all the county of  Southampton  viz  Godesfield  founded by  Henry de Blois  bishop of  Winchester  and  South Badeisley  a preceptory of the  Knights Templars  and afterwards of  St John of Jerusalem  valued at one hundred and eighteen pounds sixteen shillings and seven pence  per annum  Here then was a  preceptory  unnoticed by antiquaries between the village and  Temple  Whatever the edifice of the  preceptory  might have been it has long since been dilapidated and the whole hamlet contains now only one mean farmhouse though there were two in the memory of man  It has been usual for the religious of different orders to fall into great dissensions and especially when they were near neighbours Instances of this sort we have heard of between the monks of  Canterbury  and again between the old abbey of St  Swythun  and the comparatively new minster of  Hyde  in the city of  Winchester  Notitia Monastica p    "  Winchester Newminster  King  Alfred  founded here first only a house and chapel for the learned monk  Grimbald  whom he had brought out of  Flanders  but afterwards projected and by his will ordered a noble church or religious house to be built in the cemetery on the north side of the old minster or cathedral and designed that  Grimbald  should preside over it This was begun AD and finished to the honour of the  Holy Trinity Virgin Mary  and  St Peter  by his son king  Edward  who placed therein secular canons but AD they were expelled and an abbot and monks put in possession by bishop  Ethelwold  "Now the churches and habitations of these two societies being so very near together the differences which were occasioned by their singing bells and other matters arose to so great a height that the religious of the new monastery thought fit about AD to remove to a better and more quiet situation without the walls on the north part of the city called HYDE where king  Henry  I at the instance of  Will Gifford  bishop of  Winton  founded a stately abbey for them St  Peter  was generally accounted patron though it is sometimes called the monastery of St  Grimbald  and sometimes of St  Barnabas  "  c  Note A few years since a county bridewell or house of correction has been built on the immediate site of  Hide Abbey  In digging up the old foundations the workmen found the head of a crosier in good preservation  These feuds arose probably from different orders being crowded within the narrow limits of a city or garrisontown where every inch of ground was precious and an object of contention But with us as far as my evidences extend and while  Robert Saunford  was  master  Robert Saunforde  was  master  of the  Temple  in  Guido de Foresta  was the next in The former is fifth in a list of the  masters  in a MS  Bib Cotton Nero  E VI  and  Richard Carpenter  was  preceptor  the  Templars  and the  Priors  lived in an intercourse of mutual good offices  My papers mention three transactions the exact time of which cannot be ascertained because they fell out before dates were  usually inserted though probably they happened about the middle of the thirteenth century not long after  Saunford  became  master  The first of these is that the  Templars  shall pay to the priory of  Selborne  annually the sum of ten shillings at two half yearly payments from their chamber "  camera  " at  Sudington  "per manum  preceptoris  vel  ballivi  nostri qui pro tempore fuerit ibidem"  till they can provide the  prior  and canons with an equivalent in lands or rents within four or five miles of the said convent It is also further agreed that if the  Templars  shall be in arrears for one year that then the  prior  shall be empowered to distrain upon their live stock in  Bradeseth  The next matter was a grant from  Robert de Saunford  to the  priory  for ever of a good and sufficient road "  cheminum  " capable of admitting carriages and proper for the drift of their larger cattle from the way which extends from  Sudington  towards  Blakemere  on to the lands which the convent possesses in  Bradeseth  The third transaction though for want of dates we cannot say which happened first and which last was a grant from  Robert Samford  to the priory of a tenement and its appurtenances in the village of  Selborne  given to the  Templars  by  Americus de Vasci  Americus Vasci  by his name must have been an  Italian  and had been probably a soldier of fortune and one of  Gordon  's captains  Americus Vespucio  the person who gave name to the new world was a  florentine  This property by the manner of describing it  "totum tenementum cum omnibus pertinentiis suis scilicet in terris  hominibus  in pratis pascuis nemoribus"  c seems to have been no inconsiderable purchase and was sold for two hundred marks sterling to be applied for the buying of more land for the support of the holy war  Prior  John  is mentioned as the person to whom  Vasci  's land is conveyed But in  Willis  's list there is no prior  John  till several years after the dissolution of the order of the  Templars  in so that unless  Willis  is wrong and has omitted a prior  John  since that being the date of his first prior these transactions must have fallen out before that date  I find not the least traces of any concerns between  Gurdon  and the  Knights Templars  but probably after his death his daughter  Johanna  might have and might bestow  Temple  on that order in support of the holy land and moreover she seems to have been moving from  Selborne  when she sold her goods and chattels to the priory as mentioned above  Temple  no doubt did belong to the knights as may be asserted not only from it's name but also from another corroborating circumstance of it's being still a manor  tithefree  "for by virtue of their order"  says Dr  Blackstone  "the lands of the  Knights Templars  were privileged by the pope with a discharge from tithes"  Antiquaries have been much puzzled about the terms  preceptores  and  preceptorium  not being able to determine what officer or edisice was meant But perhaps all the while the passage quoted above from one of my papers  "per manum  preceptoris  vel  ballivi  nostri qui pro tempore fuerit ibidem"  may help to explain the difficulty For if it be allowed here that  preceptor  and  ballivus  are synonymous words then the brother who took on him that office resided in the house of the  Templars  at  Sudington  a  preceptory  where he was their  preceptor  superintended their affairs received their money and as in the instance there mentioned paid from their chamber "  camera  " as directed so that according to this  explanation a  preceptor  was no other than a steward and a  preceptorium  was his residence I am well aware that according to strict Latin the  vel  should have been  seu  or  five  and the order of the words  "  preceptoris nostri  vel ballivi qui"  et  "  ibidem  "  should have been  ibi ibidem  necessarily having reference to  two  or more persons but it will hardly be thought fair to apply the niceties of classic rules to the Latinity of the thirteenth century the writers of which seem to have aimed at nothing farther than to render themselves intelligible  There is another remark that we have made which I think corroborates what has been advanced and that is that  Richard Carpenter preceptor  of  Sudington  at the time of the transactions between the  Templars  and  Selborne  Priory did always sign  last  as a witness in the three deeds he calls himself  frater  it is true among many other brothers but subscribes with a kind of deference as if for the time being his  office  rendered him an inferior in the community  In two or three ancient records relating to St  Oswald  's hospital in the city of  Worcester  printed by Dr  Nash  p and of his collections for the history of  Worcestershire  the words  preceptorium  and  preceptoria  signify the  mastership  of the said hospital  "ad  preceptorium  five  magisterium  presentavit  preceptorii  five  magisterii  patronus Vacavit dicta  preceptoria  seu  magisterium  ad  preceptoriam  et regimen dicti hospitalisTe  preceptorem  five magistrum prefecimus"  Where  preceptorium  denotes a building or apartment it may probably mean the master's lodgings or at least the  preceptor  's apartment whatsoever may have been the office or employment of the said preceptor  A  preceptor  is mentioned in  Thoresby's Ducatus Leodiensis  or History of  Leeds  p and a deed witnessed by the  preceptor  and chaplain before dates were inserted  Du Presne  's Supplement  "  Preceptoriae  praedia  preceptoribus  assignata"    Cowel  in his Law Dictionary enumerates sixteen  preceptoriae  or  preceptories  in  England  but  Sudington  is not among themIt is remarkable that  Gurtierus  in his  Historia Templariorum  Amstel never once mentions the words  preceptor  or  preceptorium    LETTER XII  THE ladies and daughter of Sir  Adam Gurdon  were not the only benefactresses to the Priory of  Selborne  for in the year  Ela Longspee  obtained masses to be performed for her soul's health and the prior entered into an engagement that one of the convent should every day say a special mass for ever for the said benefactress whether living or dead She also engaged within five years to pay to the said convent one hundred marks of silver for the support of a  chantry  and  chantrychaplain  who should perform his masses daily in the parish church of  Selborne  A  chantry  was a chapel joined to some cathedral or parish church and endowed with annual revenues for the maintenance of one or more priests to sing mass daily for the soul of the founder and others  In the east end of the south aile there are two sharppointed gothic niches one of these probably was the place under which these masses were performed and there is the more reason to suppose as much because till within these thirty years this space was fenced off with  gothic  wooden railing and was known by the name of the south chancel  For what is said more respecting this chantry see Letter III of these AntiquitiesMention is made of a  Nicholas Langrish  capellanus de  Selborne  in the time of  Henry  VIII Was he chantrychaplain to  Ela Longspee  whose masses were probably continued to the time of the reformation More will be said of this person hereafter    The solicitude expressed by the donor plainly shews her piety and firm persuasion of the efficacy of prayers for the dead for  she seems to have made every provision for the payment of the sum stipulated within the appointed time and to have felt much anxiety lest her death or the neglect of her executors or assigns might frustrate her intentions  "Et si contingat me in solucione predicte pecunie annis predictis in parte aut in toto deficere quod absit concedo et obligo pro me et assignatis meis quod  ViceComesOxon  etqui pro tempore fuerint per omnes terras et tenementa et omnia bona mea mobilia et immobilia ubicunque in balliva sua fuerint inventa ad solucionem predictam faciendam possent nos compellere"  And again  "Et si contingat dictos religiosos labores seu expensas facere circa predictam pecuniam seu circa partem dicte pecunie volo quod dictorum religiosorum impense et labores levantur ita quod predicto priori vel uni canonicorum suorum superhiis simplici verbo credatur fine alterius honere probacionis et quod utrique

tertio decimo  Ancient deeds are often dated on a  Sunday  having been executed in churches and churchyards for the sake of notoriety and for the conveniency of procuring several witnesses to attest  "  But the reader perhaps would wish to be better informed respecting this benefactress of whom as yet he has heard no particulars  The  Ela Longspee  therefore abovementioned was a lady of high birth and rank and became countess to  Thomas de Newburgh  the sixth earl of  Warwick  she was the second daughter of the famous  Ela Longspee  countess of  Salisbury  by  William Longspee  natural son of king  Henry  II by  Rosamond  Our lady following the steps of her illustrious mother  Ela Longspee  countess of  Salisbury  in founded a monastery at  Lacock  in the county of  Wilts  and also another at  Hendon  in the county of  Somerset  in her widowhood to the honour of the Blessed Virgin and St  Bernard  CAMDEN    "was a great benefactress to the university of  Oxford  to the canons of  Oseney  the nuns of  Godstow  and other religious houses in  Oxfordshire  She died very aged in the year  Thus she survived the foundation of her chantry at  Selborne  fifteen years About this lady and her mother consult  Dugdale  's Baronage I  Dugdale  's Warwickshire I  Leland  's Itin II  and was buried before the high altar in the abbey church of  Oseney  at the head of the tomb of  Henry D'Oily  under a flat marble on which was inlaid her portraiture in the habit of a vowess engraved on a copperplate"    Edmondson's History and Genealogical Account of the Grevilles  p  LETTER XIII  THE reader is here presented with five forms respecting the chusing of a prior but as they are of some length they must be reserved for the Appendix their titles are N  o    "Charta petens licentiam elegendi  prelatum  a Domino episcopo  Wintoniensi  "Forma licentie concesse""Forma decreti post electionem conficiendi" "Modus procedendi ad electionem per formam scrutinii"et "Forma ricte presentandi electum"  Such evidences are rare and curious and throw great light upon the general  monasticoecclesiastical  history of this kingdom not yet sufficiently understood  In the year there was an election for a prior at  Selborne  when some difficulties occurring and a devolution taking place application was made to  Stratford  who was bishop of  Winchester  at that time and of course the visitor and patron of the convent at the spot abovementioned  Stratford  was bishop of  Winchester  from to when he was translated to  Canterbury    An Extract from  REG STRATFORD  Winton  P  "Commissio facta subpriori

elected by the subprior and convent by way of scrutiny that it appeared to the bishop by certificate from the dean of  Alton  that solemn citation and proclamation had been made in the church of the convent where the election was held that any who opposed the said election or elected should appearSome difficulties were started which the bishop overruled and confirmed the election and admitted the new prior  sub hac forma    "In Dei nomine Amen Ego  Johannes  permissione divina c te  Walterum de Insula  ecclesie  de Selebourne  nostre dioceseos nostrique patronatus vacantis canonicum et

the subprior and convent pro obedientia  A mandate to  Nicholas  abovenamed to release the Priory to the new prior  A mandate for the induction of the new prior  LETTER XIV  "IN the year  Wykeham  bishop of  Winchester  held a visitation of his whole diocese not only of the secular clergy through the several deaneries but also of the monasteries and religious houses of all sorts which he visited in person The next year he sent his commissioners with power to correct and reform the several irregularities and abuses which he had discovered in the course of his visitation"  "Some years afterward the bishop having visited  three several times  all the religious houses throughout his diocese and being well informed of the state and condition of each and of the particular abuses which required correction and reformation besides the orders which he had already given and the remedies which he had occasionally applied by his commissioners now issued his injunctions to each of them They were accommodated to their several exigencies and intended to correct the abuses introduced and to recall them all to a strict observation  of the rules of their respective orders Many of these injunctions are still extant and are evident monuments of the care and attention with which he discharged this part of his episcopal duty  See  Lowth  's Life of  Wykeham  "  Some of these injunctions I shall here produce and they are such as will not fail I think to give satisfaction to the antiquary both as never having been published before and as they are a curious picture of monastic irregularities at that time  The documents that I allude to are contained in the  Notabilis Visitatio de Seleburne  held at the Priory of that place by  Wykeham  in person in the year  This evidence in the original is written on two skins of parchment the one large and the other smaller and consists of a  preamble    items  and a  conclusion  which altogether evince the patient investigation of the visitor for which he had always been so remarkable in all matters of moment and how much he had at heart the regularity of those institutions of whose efficacy in their prayers for the dead he was so firmly persuaded As the bishop was so much in earnest we may be assured that he had nothing in view but to correct and reform what he found amiss and was under no bias to blacken or misrepresent as the commissioners of  Thomas  Lord  Cromwell  seem in part to have done at the time of the reformation  Letters of this sort from Dr  Layton  to  Thomas  Lord  Cromwell  are still extant  We may therefore with reason suppose that the bishop gives us an exact delineation of the morals and manners of the canons of  Selborne  at that juncture and that what he found they had omitted he enjoins them and for what they have done amiss and contrary to their rules and  statutes he reproves them and threatens them with punishment suitable to their irregularities  This  visitatio  is of considerable length and cannot be introduced into the body of this work we shall therefore refer the reader to the  Appendix  where he will find every particular while we shall take some notice and make some remarks on the most singular  items  as they occur  In the preamble the visitor says  "Considering the charge lying upon us that your blood may not be required at our hands we came down to visit your Priory as our office required and every time we repeated our visitation we found something still not only contrary to regular rules but also repugnant to religion and good reputation"  In the first article after the preamble  "he commands them on their obedience and on pain of the greater excommunication to see that the canonical hours by night and by day be sung in their choir and the masses of the Blessed  Mary  and other accustomed masses be celebrated at the proper hours with devotion and at moderate pauses and that it be not allowed to any to absent themselves from the hours and masses or to withdraw before they are finished"  Item  d He enjoins them to observe that silence to which they are so strictly bound by the rule of Saint  Augustine  at stated times and wholly to abstain from frivolous conversation  Item  th  "Not to permit such frequent passing of secular people of both sexes through their convent as if a thoroughfare from whence many disorders may and have arisen"  Item  th  "To take care that the doors of their church and Priory be so attended to that no suspected and disorderly females  'suspectae et aliae inhonestae'  pass through their choir  and cloister in the dark"  and to see that the doors of their church between the nave and the choir and the gates of their cloister opening into the fields be constantly kept shut until their first choirservice is over in the morning at dinner time and when they meet at their evening collation  A collation was a meal or repast on a fast day in lieu of a supper    Item  th mentions that several of the canons are found to be very ignorant and illiterate and enjoins the prior to see that they be better instructed by a proper master  Item  th The canons are here accused of refusing to accept of their statutable clothing year by year and of demanding a certain specified sum of money as if it were their annual rent and due This the bishop forbids and orders that the canons shall be clothed out of the revenue of the Priory and the old garments be laid by in a chamber and given to the poor according to the rule of Saint  Augustine  In  Item  th is a complaint that some of the canons are given to wander out of the precincts of the convent without leave and that others ride to their manors and farms under pretence of inspecting the concerns of the society when they please and stay as long as they please But they are enjoined never to stir either about their own private concerns or the business of the convent without leave from the prior and no canon is to go alone but to have a grave brother to accompany him  The injunction in  Item  th at this distance of time appears rather ludicrous but the visitor seems to be very serious on the occasion and says that it has been evidently proved to him that some of the canons living dissolutely after the flesh and not after the spirit sleep naked in their beds without their breeches  and shirts  "absque femoralibus et camisiis  The rule alluded to in  Item  th of not sleeping naked was enjoined the  Knights Templars  who also were subject to the rules of St  Augustine  See  Gurtleri Hist Templariorum  "  He enjoins that these culprits shall be punished by severe fasting especially if they shall be found to be faulty a third time and threatens the prior and subprior with suspension if they do not correct this enormity  In  Item  th the good bishop is very wroth with some of the canons whom he finds to be professed hunters and sportsmen keeping hounds and publicly attending huntingmatches These pursuits he says occasion much dissipation danger to the soul and body and frequent expense he therefore wishing to extirpate this vice wholly from the convent "  radicibus extirpare  " does absolutely enjoin the canons never intentionally to be present at any public noisy tumultuous huntings or to keep any hounds by themselves or by others openly or by stealth within the convent or without  Considering the strong propensity in human nature towards the pleasures of the chase it is not to be wondered that the canons of  Selborne  should languish after hunting when from their situation so near the precincts of  Wolmerforest  the king's hounds must have been often in hearing and sometimes in sight from their windowsIf the bishop was so offended at these sporting canons what would he have said to our modern foxhunting divines    In  Item  th he forbids the canons in office to make their business a plea for not attending the service of the choir since by these means either divine worship is neglected or their brothercanons are overburdened  By  Item  th we are informed that the original number of canons at the Priory of  Selborne  was  fourteen  but that at this visitation they were found to be let down to  eleven  The visitor therefore strongly  and earnestly enjoins them that with all due speed and diligence they should proceed to the election of proper persons to fill up the vacancies under pain of the greater excommunication  In  Item  th the prior and canons are accused of suffering through neglect notorious dilapidations to take place among their manerial houses and tenements and in the walls and enclosures of the convent itself to the shame and scandal of the institution they are therefore enjoined under pain of suspension to repair all defects within the space of six months  Item  th charges them with grievously burthening the said Priory by means of sales and grants of  liveries  "  Liberationes  or  liberaturae  allowances of corn c to servants  delivered  at certain times and in certain quantities as  clothes  were among the allowances from religious houses to their dependants  See the  corrodies  granted by  Croyland abbey  Hist of Croyland  Appendix N  o  XXXIV  "It is not improbable that the word in afterages came to be confined to the uniform of the retainers of servants of the great who were hence called  livery servants  "  Sir John Cullum's Hist of Hawsted  and  corrodies  A  corrody  is an allowance to a servant living in an abbey or priory    The bishop in  item  th accuses the canons of neglect and omission with respect to their perpetual  chantryservices  Item  th The visitor here conjures the prior and canons not to withhold their original  alms  "  eleemosynas  " nor those that they were enjoined to distribute for the good of the souls of founders and benefactors he also strictly orders that the fragments and broken victuals both from the hall of their prior and their common refectory should be carefully collected together by their  eleemosynarius  and given to the poor without any diminution the officer to be suspended for neglect or omission  Item  d He bids them distribute their  pittances  "  pitancias  "  Pitancia  an allowance of bread and beer or other provision to any pious use especially to the religious in a monastery c for augmentation of their commons"  Gloss to Kennett's Par Antiq  " regularly on obits anniversaries festivals c  Item  th All and every one of the canons are hereby inhibited from standing godfather to  any boy  for the future  "ne  compatres alicujus pueri  de cetero fieri presumatis"  unless by express license from the bishop obtained because from such relationship favour and affection nepotism and undue influence arise to the injury and detriment of religious institutions  "The relationship between sponsors and their godchildren who were called  spiritual sons  and  daughters  was formerly esteemed much more sacred than at present The presents at christenings were sometimes very considerable the connexion lasted through life and was closed with a legacy This last mark of attention seems to have been thought almost indispensable for in a will from whence no extracts have been given the testator left every one of his godchildren a bushel of barley"  Sir John Cullum's Hist of Hawsted  "D  Margaretae  filiae Regis primogenitae quam  filiolam  quia ejus in baptismo  compater  fuit appellat cyphum aureum et quadraginta libras legavit"  Archbishop  Parker  de Antiquitate Eccles Brit speaking of Archbishop  Morton    Item  th The visitor herein severely reprimands the canons for appearing publicly in what would be called in the universities an  unstatutable manner  and for wearing of boots  "caligae de  Burneto  et  sotularium  in ocrearum loco ad modum sotularium  Du Fresue  is copious on  caligae  of several sorts  "Hoc item de Clericis presertim beneficiatis  caligis  scacatis chequered rubeis et viridibus publice utentibus dicimus esse censendum"  Statut Eccles Tutel  The chequered boots seem to be the highland plaid stockings  "  Burnetum  i e  Brunetum  pannus non ex lanâ nativi coloris confectus"    "  Sotularium  i e subtalaris quia sub talo est Peculium genus quibus maxime Monachi nocte utebantur in aestate in hyeme vero Soccis"  This writer gives many quotations concerning  Sotularia  which were not to be made too shapely nor were the  caligae  to be laced on too nicely  "  It is remarkable that the bishop expresses more warmth against this than any other irregularity and strictly enjoins them under pain of ecclesiastical censures and even imprisonment if necessary a threat not made use of before for the future to wear boots  "ocreis seu botis"  according to the regular usage of their ancient order  Item  th He here again but with less earnestness forbids them foppish ornaments and the affectation of appearing like beaux with garments edged with costly furs with fringed gloves and silken girdles trimmed with gold and silver It is remarkable that no punishment is annexed to this injunction  Item  st He here singly and severally forbids each canon not admitted to a cure of souls to administer extreme unction or the sacrament to clergy or laity or to perform the service of matrimony till he has taken out the license of the parish priest  Item  d The bishop says in this  item  that he had observed and found in his several visitations that the sacramental plate and cloths of the altar surplices c were sometimes left in such an uncleanly and disgusting condition as to make the beholders shudder with horror  "quod aliquibus sunt horrori  "Men abhorred the offering of the Lord"    Sam chap  ii  v    Strange as this account may appear to modern delicacy the author when first in orders twice met with similar circumstances attending the sacrament at two churches belonging to two obscure villages In the first he found the inside of the chalice covered with birds' dung and in the other the communioncloth soiled with cabbage and the greasy drippings of a gammon of bacon The good dame at the great farmhouse who was to furnish the cloth being a notable woman thought it best to save her clean linen and so sent a foul cloth that had covered her own table for two or three  Sundays  before  "  he therefore enjoins them for the future to see that the plate cloths and vestments be kept bright clean and in decent order and what  must surprise the reader addsthat he expects for the future that the sacrist should provide for the sacrament good wine pure and unadulterated and not as had often been the practice that which was sour and tending to decayhe says farther that it seems quite preposterous to omit in sacred matters that attention to decent cleanliness the neglect of which would disgrace a common convivial meeting  " ne turpe toral ne sordida mappa  "Corruget nares ne non et cantharus et lanx  "Oftendat tibi te "    Item  d says that though the relics of saints the plate holy vestments and books of religious houses are forbidden by canonical institutes to be pledged or lent out upon pawn yet as the visitor finds this to be the case in his several visitations he therefore strictly enjoins the prior forthwith to recall those pledges and to restore them to the convent and orders that all the papers and title deeds thereto belonging should be safely deposited and kept under three locks and keys  In the course of the  Visitatio Notabilis  the  constitutions  of  Legate Ottobonus  are frequently referred to  Ottobonus  was afterwards  Pope Adrian  V and died in His constitutions are in  Lyndewood's Provinciale  and were drawn up in the d of  Henry  III  In the  Vifitatio Notabilis  the usual punishment is fasting on bread and beer and in cases of repeated delinquency on bread and water On these occasions  quarta feria  et  sexta feria  are mentioned often and are to be understood of the days of the  week  numerically on which such punishment is to be inflicted  LETTER XV  THOUGH bishop  Wykeham  appears somewhat stern and rigid in his visitatorial character towards the Priory of  Selborne  yet he was on the whole a liberal friend and benefactor to that convent which like every society or individual that fell in his way partook of the generosity and benevolence of that munificent prelate  "In the year  William  of  Wykeham  out of his mere good will and liberality discharged the whole debts of the prior and convent of  Selborne  to the amount of one hundred and ten marks eleven shillings and sixpence  Yet in ten years time we find by the  Notabilis Visitatio  that all their relics plate vestments titledeeds c were in pawn  and a few years before he died he made a free gift of one hundred marks to the same Priory on which account the prior and convent voluntarily engaged for the celebration of two masses a day by two canons of the convent for ten years for the bishop's welfare if he should live so long and for his soul if he should die before the expiration of this term  Lowth  's Life of  Wykeham  "  At this distance of time it seems matter of great wonder to us how these societies so nobly endowed and whose members were exempt by their very institution from every means of personal and  family expense could possibly run in debt without squandering their revenues in a manner incompatible with their function  Religious houses might sometimes be distressed in their revenues by fires among their buildings or large dilapidations from storms c but no such accident appears to have befallen the Priory at  Selborne  Those situate on public roads or in great towns where there were shrines of saints were liable to be intruded on by travellers devotees and pilgrims and were subject to the importunity of the poor who swarmed at their gates to partake of doles and broken victuals Of these disadvantages some convents used to complain and especially those at  Canterbury  but this Priory from it's sequestered situation could seldom be subject to either of these inconveniencies and therefore we must attribute it's frequent debts and embarrassments well endowed as it was to the bad conduct of it's members and a general inattention to the interests of the institution  LETTER XVI  BEAUFORT was bishop of  Winchester  from to and yet notwithstanding this long episcopate only tom I of  Beaufort  's Register is to be found This loss is much to be regretted as it must unavoidably make a gap in the history of  Selborne  Priory and perhaps in the list of it's priors  In there was an election for a prior and again in  In vol I p of

and explained the modes of proceeding to election they agreed unanimously to proceed  "per viam seu formam  simplicis compromissi  "  when  John Wynchestre  subprior and all the others the commissaries undernamed excepted named and chose brothers  Richard Elstede Thomas Halyborne John Lemyngton  the sacrist  John Stepe  chantor and  Richard Putworth  canons to be commissaries who were sworn each to nominate and elect a fit person to be prior and empowered by letters patent under the common seal to be in force only until the darkness of the night of the same daythat they or the greater part of them should elect for the whole convent within the limited time from their own number or from the rest of the conventthat one of them should publish their consent in common before the clergy and peoplethey then all promised to receive as prior the person these five canons should fix on These commissaries seceded from the chapterhouse to the refectory of the Priory and were shut in with master  John Penkester  bachelor of laws and  John Couke  and  John Lynne  perpetual vicars of the parish churches of  Newton  and  Selborne  and with  Sampson Maycock  a public notary where they treated of the election when they unanimously agreed on  John Wynchestre  and appointed  Thomas Halyborne  to chuse him in common  for all and to publish the election as customary and returned long before it was dark to the chapterhouse where  Thomas Halyborne  read publicly the instrument of election when all the brothers the new prior excepted singing solemnly the hymn "Te Deum laudamus"  fecerunt deportari novum electum  by some of the brothers from the chapterhouse to the high altar of the church  It seems here as if the canons used to  chair  their new elected prior from the chapterhouse to the high altar of their convent church In letter XXI on the same occasion it is said  "et sic canentes dictum electum ad majus altare ecclesie  deduximus  ut apud nos moris est"  and the hymn being sung  dictisque versiculoet oratione consuetis in hac parte  Thomas Halyborne  mox tunc ibidem  before the clergy and people of both sexes solemnly published the election  in vulgari  Then  Richard Elstede  and the whole convent by their proctors and nuncios appointed for the purposes  Thomas Halyborne  and  John Stepe  required several times the assent of the elected  "et tandem post diutinas interpellationes et deliberationem providam penes se habitam in hac parte divine nolens ut asseruit resistere voluntati"  within the limited time he signified his acceptance in the usual written form of words The bishop is then supplicated to confirm their election and do the needful under common seal in the chapterhouse  November    The bishop  January    apud  Esher  in camera inferiori  declared the election duly made and ordered the new prior to be inductedfor this the archdeacon of  Winchester  was written to  "stallumque in choro et locum in capitulo juxta morem

opulent were become voluptuous and licentious and had deviated entirely from their original institutions The laity saw with indignation the wealth and possessions of their pious ancestors perverted to the service of sensuality and indulgence and spent in gratifications highly unbecoming the purposes for which they were  given A total disregard to their respective rules and discipline drew on the monks and canons a heavy load of popular odium Some good men there were who endeavoured to oppose the general delinquency but their efforts were too feeble to stem the torrent of monastic luxury As far back as the year  Wickliffe  's principles and doctrines had made some progress were well received by men who wished for a reformation and were defended and maintained by them as long as they dared till the bishops and clergy began to be so greatly alarmed that they procured an act to be passed by which the secular arm was empowered to support the corrupt doctrines of the church but the first lollard was not burnt until the year  The wits also of those times did not spare the gross morals of the clergy but boldly ridiculed their ignorance and profligacy The most remarkable of these were  Chaucer  and his contemporary  Robert Langelande  better known by the name of  Piers Plowman  The laughable tales of the former are familiar to almost every reader while the  visions  of the latter are but in few hands With a quotation from the  Passus Decimus  of this writer I shall conclude my letter not only on account of the remarkable prediction therein contained which carries with it somewhat of the air of a prophecy but also as it seems to have been a striking picture of monastic insolence and dissipation and a specimen of one of the keenest pieces of satire now perhaps subsisting in any language ancient or modern  "Now is religion a rider a romer by streate  "A leader of lovedays and a loud begger  "A pricker on a palfrey from maner to maner  "A heape of hounds at his arse as he a lord were  "And but if his knave kneel that shall his cope bring  "He loureth at him and asketh him who taught him curtesie  "Little had lords to done to give lands from her heirs  "To religious that have no ruth if it rain on her altars  "In many places ther they persons be by himself at ease  "Of the poor have they no pity and that is her charitie  "And they letten hem as lords her lands lie so broad  "And  there shal come a king  F a  "This prediction although a probable conclusion concerning a king who after a time would suppress the religious houses is remarkable I imagined it might have been foisted into the copies in the reign of king  Henry  VIII but it is to be found in MSS of this poem older than the year "  fol a b  "Again where he  Piers Plowman  alludes to the  Knights Templars  lately suppressed he says  " Men of holie kirk  "Shall  turn as Templars  did  the tyme approacheth nere  "  "This I suppose was a favourite doctrine in  Wickliffe  's

reform the Priory of  Selborne  When  Waynflete  came to the see he found prior  Stype  alias  Stepe  still living who had been elected as long ago as the year  Among my documents I find a curious paper of the things put into the custody of  Peter Bernes  the sacrist and especially some  relics  the title of this evidence is  "N  o  Indentura prioris de  Selborne  quorundam tradit  Petro Bernes  sacristae ibidem ann Hen VIuna cum confiss ejusdem  Petri  script"  The occasion of this catalogue or list of effects being drawn between the prior and sacrist does not appear nor the date when only that it happened in the reign of  Hen  VI This transaction probably took place when  Bernes  entered on his office and there is the more reason to suppose that to be the case because the list consists of vestments and implements and relics such as belonged to the church of the Priory and fell under the care of the sacrist For the numerous  items  I shall refer the curious reader to the Appendix and shall just mention the relics although they are not all specified and the state of the live stock of the monastery at that juncture  "Item  osculatōr  argent  "Item  osculatorium  cum  osse digiti

it and went and told  Jesus  "  Matt iv Farther would be difficult to say    "Item parvam  crucem  cum V  reliquiis  "Item  anulum  argent et deauratum  St Edmundi  November  in the calendar  Edmund

great farm houses a family comb chained to a post for the use of the hinds when they came in to their meals  "  The  staurum  or live stock is quite ridiculous consisting only of  " vacce sus hoggett et porcell"  viz two cows one sow four porkers and four pigs  LETTER XIX  STEPE died towards the end of the year as we may suppose pretty far advanced in life having been prior fortyfour years  On the very day that the vacancy happened viz  January  the subprior and convent petitioned the visitor  "vos unicum levamen nostrum et spem unanimiter rogamus quatinus eligendum ex nobis unum confratrem de gremio nostro in nostra religione probatum et expertem licenciam vestram paternalem cum plena libertate nobis concedere dignemini graciose"  Reg Waynflete  tom I  Instead of the license requested we find next a commission  "custodie prioratus de  Selebourne  durante vacatione"  addressed to brother  Peter Berne  canonregular of the priory of  Selebourne  and of the order of St  Augustine  appointing him keeper of the said priory and empowering him to collect and receive the profits and revenues and  "alia bona"  of the said priory and to exercise in every respect the full power and authority of a prior but to be responsible to the visitor finally and to maintain this superiority during the bishop's pleasure only This instrument is dated from the bishop's manorhouse in  Southwark March  and the seventh of his consecration  After this transaction it does not appear that the chapter of the Priory proceeded to any election on the contrary we find that at six months end from the vacancy the visitor declared that a lapse had taken place and that therefore he did confer the priorship on canon  Peter Bernc    "Prioratum vacantem et ad nostram collationem seu provisionem jure ad nos in hac parte  per lapsum  temporis legitime devoluto spectantem tibi fc  P Berne  de legitimo matrimonio procreato cconferimus"  c This deed bears date July  Reg Waynflete  tom I p  On  February  the visitor issued out a power of sequestration against the Priory of  Selborne  on account of notorious dilapidations which threatened manifest ruin to the roofs walls and edifices of the said convent and appointing  John Hammond  BD rector of the parish church of  Hetlegh John Hylling  vicar of the parish church of  Newton Valence  and  Walter Gorfin  inhabitant of the parish of  Selborne  his sequestrators to exact collect levy and receive all the profits and revenues of the said convent he adds  "ac ea sub areto et tuto custodiatis custodirive faciatis"  as they would answer it to the bishop at their peril  In consequence of these proceedings prior  Berne  on the last day of  February  and the next year produced a state of the revenues of the Priory N  o  called  "A paper conteyning the value of the manors and lands pertayning to the Priory of  Selborne    Edward  III with a note of charges yssuing out of it"  This is a curious document and will appear in the Appendix From circumstances in this paper it is plain that the sequestration produced good effects for in it are to be found bills of repairs to a considerable amount  By this evidence also it appears that there were at that juncture only four canons at the Priory  If bishop  Wykeham  was so disturbed see  Notab Visitatio  to find the number of canons reduced from fourteen to eleven what would he have said to have seen it diminished below one third of that number  and that these and their four household servants during this sequestration for their clothing wages and diet were allowed  per ann  xxx lib and that the annual pension of the lord prior reside where he would was to be x lib  In the year prior  Berne  probably wearied out by the dissensions and want of order that prevailed in the convent resigned his priorship into the hands of the bishop  Reg Waynflete  tom I pars  ma  fol  March  AD  "In quadam alta camera juxta magnam portam manerii of the bishop of  Wynton de Waltham  coram eodem rev patre ibidem tunc sedente  Peter Berne  prior of  Selborne  ipsum prioratum in sacras et venerabiles manus of the bishop viva voce libere resignavit and his resignation was admitted before two witnesses and a notarypublic In consequence  March  th before the bishop in capella manerii sui ante dicti pro tribunali sedente comparuerunt fratres"  Peter Berne Thomas London William Wyndesor  and  William Paynell  alias  Stretford  canons regular of the Priory  "capitulum et conventum ejusdem ecclesie facientes ac jus et voces in electione futura prioris dicti prioratus solum et in solidum ut asseruerunt habentes"  and after the bishop had notified to them the vacancy of a prior with his free license to elect deliberated awhile and then by way of compromise as they affirmed unanimously transferred their right of election to the bishop before witnesses In consequence of this the bishop after full deliberation proceeded  April  th  "in capella manerii sui de  Waltham  "  to the election of a prior  "et fratrem  Johannem Morton  priorem ecclesie conventualis de  Reygate  dicti ordinis S  ti    Augustini Wynton  dioc in priorem vice et nomine omnium et singulorum canonicorum predictorum elegit in ordine sacerdotali et etate licita constitutum c"  And on the same day in the same place and before the same witnesses  John Morton  resigned to the bishop the priorship of  Reygate viva voce  The bishop then required his consent to his own election  "qui licet in parte renitens tanti reverendi patris se confirmans"  obeyed and signified his consent  oraculo vive vocis  Then was there a mandate citing any one who would gainsay the said election to appear before the bishop or his commissary in his chapel at  Farnham  on the second day of  May  next The dean of the deanery of  Aulton  then appeared before the chancellor his commissary and returned the citation or mandate dated  April  d with signification in writing of his having published it as required dated  Newton Valence May  st This certificate being read the four canons of  Selborne  appeared and required the election to be confirmed  et ex super abundanti  appointed  William Long  their proctor to solicit in their name that he might be canonically confirmed  John Morton  also appeared and proclamation was made and no one appearing against him the commissary pronounced all absentees contumacious and precluded them from objecting at any other time and at the instance of  John Morton  and the proctor confirmed the election by his decree and directed his mandate to the rector of  Hedley  and the vicar of  Newton Valence  to install him in the usual form  Thus for the first time was a person a stranger to the convent of  Selborne  and never canon of that monastery elected prior though the style of the petitions in former elections used to run thus  "Vosrogamus quatinus eligendum ex  nobis  unum  confratrem  de  gremio nostro  licentiam vestramnobis concedere dignemini"  LETTER XX  PRIOR  Morton  dying in two canons by themselves proceeded to election and chose a prior but two more one of them  Berne  complaining of not being summoned objected to the proceedings as informal till at last the matter was compromised that the bishop should again for that turn nominate as he had before But the circumstances of this election will be best explained by the following extract  REG WAYNFLETE tom II pars  ma  fol  Memorandum AD August  William Wyndesor  a canonregular of the Priory of  Selburne  having been elected prior on the death of brother  John  appeared in person before the bishop in his chapel at  South Waltham  He  was attended on this occasion by  Thomas London  and  John Bromesgrove  canons who had elected him  Peter Berne  and  William Stratfeld  canons also presented themselves at the same time complaining that in this business they had been overlooked and not summoned and that therefore the validity of the election might with reason be called in question and quarrels and dissensions might probably arise between the newly chosen prior and the parties thus neglected  After some altercation and dispute they all came to an agreement with the new prior that what had been done should be rejected and annulled and that they would again for this turn transfer to the bishop their power to elect order and provide them another prior whom they promised unanimously to admit  The bishop accepted of this offer before witnesses and on  September  in an inner chamber near the chapel abovementioned after full deliberation chose brother  Thomas Fairwise  vicar of  Somborne  a canonregular of Saint  Augustine  in the Priory of  Bruscough  in the diocese of  Coventry  and  Litchfield  to be prior of  Selborne  The form is nearly as above in the last election The canons are again enumerated  W Wyndesor  subprior  P Berne T London W Stratfeld J Bromesgrove  who had formed the chapter and had requested and obtained license to elect but had unanimously conferred their power on the bishop In consequence of this proceeding the bishop taking the business upon himself that the Priory might not suffer detriment for want of a governor appoints the aforesaid  T Fairwise  to be prior A citation was ordered as above for gainsayers to appear  October  th before the bishop or his commissaries at  South Waltham  but none appearing the commissaries admitted the said  Thomas  ordered him to be installed  and sent the usual letter to the convent to render him due obedience  Thus did the bishop of  Winchester  a second time appoint a stranger to be prior of  Selborne  instead of one chosen out of the chapter For this seeming irregularity the visitor had no doubt good and sufficient reasons as probably may appear hereafter  LETTER XXI  WHATEVER might have been the abilities and disposition of prior  Fairwise  it could not have been in his power to have brought about any material reformation in the Priory of  Selborne  because he departed this life in the month of  August  before he had presided one twelvemonth  As soon as their governor was buried the chapter applied to their visitor for leave to chuse a new prior which being granted after deliberating for a time they proceeded to an election by a  scrutiny  But as this mode of voting has not been described but by the mere form in the  Appendix  an extract from the bishop's register representing the manner more fully may not be disagreeable to several readers  WAYNEFLETE REG tom II pars  ma  fol  "Reverendo c ac nostro patrono

vacancy incur harm or loss unanimously agreed on  August  the last for the day of election on which day having first celebrated mass "De sancto spiritu" at the high altar and having called a chapter by tolling a bell about ten o' the clock we  William Wyndesor  president  Peter Berne Thomas London  and  William Stratfield  canons who alone had voices being the only canons about ten o' the clock first sung "Veni Creator" the letters and license being read in the presence of many persons there Then  william Wyndesor  in his own name and that of all the canons made solemn proclamation enjoining all who had no right to vote to depart out of the chapterhouse When all were withdrawn except  Guyllery de Lacuna  in decretis Baccalarius and  Robert Peverell  notarypublic and also the two chaplains the first was requested to stay that he might direct and inform us in the mode of election the other that he might record and attest the transactions and the two last that they might be witnesses to them  Then having read the constitution of the general council  "Quia propter"  and the forms of elections contained in it being sufficiently explained to them by  De Lacuna  as well in Latin as the vulgar tongue and having deliberated in what mode to proceed in this election they resolved on that of  scrutiny  Three of the canons  Wyndesor Berne  and  London  were made  scrutators Berne London  and  Stratfeld  chusing  Wyndesor Wyndesor London  and  Stratfeld  chusing  Berne Wyndesor Berne  and  Stratfeld  chusing  London  They were empowered to take each other's vote and then that of

taking the voice of the third in succession privately  Wyndesor  voted first  "Ego credo  Petrum Berne  meliorem et utiliorem ad regimen istius ecclesie et in ipsum consentio ac cum nomino"  c  Berne  was next sworn and in like manner nominated  Wyndesor London  nominated  Berne Stratfeld  was then called and sworn and nominated  Berne  "Quibus in scriptis redactis"  by the notarypublic they returned to the upper part of the chapterhouse where by  Wyndesor  "sic purecta fecerunt in communi"  and then solemnly in form written declared the election of  Berne  when all  "antedicto nostro

electionem clero et populo infra chorum dicte ecclesie congregatis publicavit et personam electi publice et personaliter ostendit"  We then returned to the chapterhouse except our prior and  Wyndesor  was appointed by the other two  their proctor to desire the assent of the elected and to notify what had been done to the bishop and to desire him to confirm the election and do whatever else was necessary Then their proctor before the witnesses required  Berne  's assent in the chapterhouse  "qui quidem instanciis et precibus multiplicatis devictus"  consented  "licet indignus electus"  in writing They therefore request the bishop's confirmation of their election  "sic canonice et solemniter celebrata"  c c Sealed with their common seal and subscribed and attested by the notary Dat in

mandate from the bishop for the appearance of gainsayers of the election there on that dayand no one appearing the absentees were declared contumacious and the election confirmed and the vicar of  Aulton  was directed to induct and install the prior in the usual manner  Thus did canon  Berne  though advanced in years reassume his abdicated priorship for the second time to the no small satisfaction as it may seem of the bishop of  Winchester  who professed as will be shown not long hence an high opinion of his abilities and integrity  LETTER XXII  As prior  Berne  when chosen in held his priorship only to and then made a voluntary resignation wearied and disgusted as we may conclude by the disorder that prevailed in his convent it is no matter of wonder that when rechosen in he should not long maintain his station as old age was then coming fast upon him and the increasing anarchy and misrule of that declining institution required unusual vigour and resolution to stem that torrent of profligacy which was hurrying it on to it's dissolution We find accordingly that in he resigned his dignity again into the hands of the bishop  WAYNFLETE REG fol  Resignatio Prioris de Seleborne  May    Peter Berne  resigned the priorship  May  the bishop admitted his resignation  "in manerio suo  de Waltham  "  and declared the priorship void  "et priorat solacio destitutum esse"  and granted his letters for proceeding to a new election when all the religious assembled in the chapterhouse did transfer their power under their seal to the bishop by the following public instrument  "In Dei nomine Amen"  c AD Maii In the chapterhouse for the election of a prior for that day on the free resignation of  Peter Berne  having celebrated in the first place mass at the high altar  "De spiritu sancto"  and having called a chapter by tolling a bell  ut moris est  in the presence of a notary and witnesses appeared personally  Peter Berne Thomas Ashford Stephen Clydgrove  and  John Ashton  presbyters and  Henry Canwood  Here we see that all the canons were changed in six years and that there was quite a new chapter  Berne  excepted between and for instead of  Wyndesor London  and  Stratfeld  we find  Ashford Clydgrove Ashton  and  Canwood  all new men who were soon gone in their turn off the stage and are heard of no more For in six years after there seem to have been no canons at all  in chapter assembled and after singing the hymn  " '  Veni Creator Spiritus  ' cum versiculo et oratione '  Deus qui corda  ' declarataque licentia Fundatoris et patroni futurum priorem eligendi concessa et constitutione consilii generalis que incipit '  Quia propter  ' declaratis viisque per quas possent ad hanc electionem procedere"  by the  decretorum doctorem  whom the canons had taken to direct themthey all and every one  "dixerunt et affirmarunt se nolle ad aliquam viam procedere"  but for this turn only renounced their right and unanimously transferred their power to the bishop the ordinary of the place promising to receive whom he should provide and appointed a proctor to present the instrument to the bishop under their seal and required their notary to draw it up in due form c subscribed by the notary  After the visitor had fully deliberated on the matter he proceeded to the choice of a prior and elected by the following instrument  John Sharp  alias  Glastenbury  Fol PROVISIO PRIORIS per  EPM  Willmus  c to our beloved brother in CHRIST  John Sharp  alias  Glastenbury  Ecclesie conventualis de  Bruton  of the order of St  Austin  in the diocese of  Bath  and

our seal  "Dat in manerio nostro de  Suthwaltham May  "  "et nostre Consec  Thus did the bishop three times out of the four that he was at liberty to nominate appoint a prior from a distance a stranger to the place to govern the convent of  Selborne  hoping by this method to have broken the cabal and to have interrupted that habit of mismanagement that had pervaded the society but he acknowledges in an evidence lying before us that he never did suceed to his wishes with respect to those late governors  "quos tamen male se habuisse et inutiliter administrare et administrasse usque ad presentia tempora post debitam investigationem c invenit"  The only time that he appointed from among the canons he made choice of  Peter Berne  for whom he had conceived the greatest esteem and regard  When prior  Berne  first relinquished his priorship he returned again to his former condition of canon in which he continued for some years but when he was rechosen and had abdicated a second time we find him in a sorlorn state and in danger of being reduced to beggary had not the bishop of  Winchester  interposed in his favour and with great humanity insisted on a provision for  him for life The reason for this difference seems to have been that in the first case though in years he might have been hale and capable of taking his share in the duty of the convent in the second he was broken with age and no longer equal to the functions of a canon  Impressed with this idea the bishop very benevolently interceded in his favour and laid his injunctions on the newelected prior in the following manner  Fol  "In Dei nomine Amen Nos  Willmus  c considerantes  Petrum Berne  "  late prior  "in administratione spiritualium et temporalium prioratus laudabiliter vixisse et rexisse ipsumque senio et corporis debilitate confractum ne in opprobrium religionis  mendicari cogatur  eidem annuam pensionem a Domino  Johanne Sharp  alias  Glastonbury  priore moderno"  and his successors and from the Priory or church to be payed every year during his life  "de voluntate et ex consensu expressis"  of the said  John Sharp  "sub ea que sequitur forma verborumassignamus"  st That the said prior and his successors for the time being  honeste exhibebunt  of the fruits and profits of the priorship  "eidem esculenta et poculenta"  while he remained in the Priory  "sub consimili portione eorundem prout convenienter priori"  for the time being  ministrari contigerit  and in like manner  uni famulo  whom he should chuse to wait on him as to the  servientibus  of the prior  Item  "Invenient seu exhibebunt eidem unam honestam cameram"  in the Priory  "cum focalibus necessariis seu opportunis ad eundem"  Item  We will ordain c to the said  P Berne  an annual pension of ten marks from the revenue of the Priory to be paid by the hands of the prior quarterly  The bishop decrees farther that  John Sharp  and his successors shall take an oath to observe this injunction and that before their installation  "Lecta et facta sunt haec in quodam alto oratorio"  belonging to the bishop at  Suthwaltham May  in the presence of  John Sharp  who gave his assent and then took the oath before witnesses with the other oaths before the chancellor who decreed he should be inducted and installed as was done that same day  How  John Sharp  alias  Glastonbury  acquitted himself in his priorship and in what manner he made a vacancy whether by resignation or death or whether he was removed by the visitor does not appear we only find that some time in the year there was no prior and that the bishop nominated canon  Ashford  to fill the vacancy  LETTER XXIII  THIS  Thomas Ashford  was most undoubtedly the last prior of  Selborne  and therefore here will be the proper place to say something concerning a list of the priors and to endeavour to improve that already given by others  At the end of bishop  Tanner's Notitia Monastica  the folio edition among  Brown Willis's Principals  of  Religious Houses  occur the names of eleven of the priors of  Selborne  with dates But this list is imperfect and particularly at the beginning for though the Priory was founded in yet it commences with  Nich de Cantia  elected in so that for the first thirty years no prior is mentioned yet there must have been one or more We were in hopes that the register of  Peter de Rupibus  would have rectified this omission but when it was examined no information of the sort was to be found From the year the list is much corrected and improved and the reader may depend on it's being thence forward very exact  A  LIST  of the  PRIORS  of  SELBORNE PRIORY  from  Brown Willis's Principals  of  Religious Houses  with additions within    by the author    John  was prior  sine dat    See in

canons and for some time without a prior was tending swiftly to it's dissolution  When  Sharp  's alias  Glastonbury  's priorship ended does not appear The bishop says that he had been obliged to remove some priors for maleadministration but it is not well explained how that could be the case with any unless with  Sharp  because all the others chosen during his episcopate died in their office  viz Morton  and  Fairwise Berne  only excepted who relinquished twice voluntarily and was moreover approved of by  Wayneflete  as a person of integrity But the way to shew what ineffectual pains the bishop took and what difficulties he met with will be to quote the words of the libel of his proctor  Radulphus Langley  who appeared for the bishop in the process of the impropriation of the Priory of  Selborne  The extract is taken from an attested copy  "  Item  that the said bishopdicto prioratui et personis ejusdem pie compatiens sollicitudines pastorales labores et diligentias gravissimas

circumstances of their numerous institution and scanty provision and the ruinous and perverted condition of the Priory The bishop appoints commissaries to inquire into the state of the said monastery and if found expedient to confirm the appropriation of it to the college which soon after appoints attornies to take possession  September  But the way to give the reader a thorough insight respecting this transaction will be to transcribe a farther proportion of the process of the impropriation from the beginning which will lay open the manner of proceeding and shew the consent of the parties

presence of the other proctors required that they should be compelled to answer when they all allowed the articles  "fuisse esse vera"  and the commissary at the request of  Preston  concluded the business and appointed  Monday August  th for giving his decree in the same church of  Essher  and it was that day read and contains a recapitulation with the sentence of union c witnessed and attested  As soon as the president and fellows of  Magdalen college  had obtained the decision of the commissary in their favour they proceeded to supplicate the  pope  and to entreat his holiness that he would give his sanction to the sentence of union Some difficulties were started at  Rome  but they were surmounted by the college agent as appears by his letters from that city At length  pope Innocent  VIII by a  bull  There is nothing remarkable in this  bull  of  pope Innocent  except the statement of the annual revenue of the Priory of  Selborne  which is therein estemated at  flor curi  whereas bishop  Godwin  sets it at  l    s  ¼  d  Now a  floren  so named says Camden because made by  Florentines  was a gold coin of king  Edward  III in value  s  whereof is not one seventh part of  l    s  ¼  d  bearing date the th day of  June  in the year of our Lord and in the second year of his pontificate confirmed what had been done and suppressed the convent  Thus fell the considerable and wellendowed Priory of  Selborne  after it had subsisted about two hundred and fiftyfour years about seventyfour years after the suppression of Priories alien by  Henry  V and about fifty years before the general dissolution of monasteries by  Henry  VIII The founder it is probable had  fondly imagined that the sacredness of the institution and the pious motives on which it was established might have preserved it inviolate to the end of timeyet it fell  "To teach us that God attributes to  place  "No sanctity if none be thither brought  "By men who there frequent or therein

the Priory with his late founded college and was succeeded in the see of  Winchester  by  Peter Courtney  some time towards the end of the year  In the beginning of the following year the new bishop released the president and fellows of  Magdalen College  from all actions respecting the Priory of  Selborne  and the prior and convent of Saint  Swithun  as the chapter of  Winchester  cathedral

several centuries standing are still preserved in common use with little or no variationas  Norton Southington Durton Achangre Blackmore Bradshot Rood Plestor  c c At the same time it should be acknowledged that other places have entirely lost their original titles as  le Buri  and  Trucstede  in this village and  la Liega  or  la Lyge  which was the name of the original site of the Priory c  Of some of them I shall take notice where any thing singular occurs  And here first we meet with  Paradyss  Paradise  mede  Every convent had it's  Paradise  which probably was an enclosed orchard pleasantly laid out and planted with fruittrees  Tylehouse  grove so distinguished from having a  tiled house  near it  Men at first heaped sods or fern or heath on their roofs to keep off the inclemencies of weather and then by degrees laid straw or haum The first refinements on roofing were shingles which are very ancient Tiles are a very late and imperfect covering and were not much in use till the beginning of the sixteenth century The first tiled house  at Nottingham  was in    Buttwood close  here the servants of the Priory and the villageswains exercised themselves with their long bows and shot at a mark against a butt or bank  There is also a  Buttclose  just at the back of the village    Cundyth  conduit  wood  the engrosser of the lease not understanding this name has made a strange barbarous word of it  Conduitwood  was and is a steep rough cowpasture lying above the Priory at about a quarter of a mile to the southwest In the side of this field there is a spring of water that never fails at the head of which a cistern was built which communicated with leaden pipes that conveyed water to the monastery When this reservoir was first constructed does not appear we only know that it underwent a repair in the episcopate of bishop  Wainfleet  about the year  N  "Clausure terre abbatie ecclesie parochiali de  Seleburne  ix  s  iii  d  Reparacionibus domorum predicti prioratus iii  lib  xi  s Aque conduct  ibidem xxiii  d  "  Whether these pipes only conveyed the water to the Priory for common and culinary purposes or contributed to any matters of ornament and elegance we shall not pretend to say nor when artists and mechanics first understood any thing of  hydraulics  and that water confined in tubes would rise to it's original level There is a person now living who had been employed formerly in digging for these pipes and once discovered several yards which they sold for old lead  There was also a plot of ground called  Tanhouse garden  and "  Tannaria sua  " a  tanyard of their own  has been mentioned in Letter XVI This circumstance I just take notice of as an instance that monasteries had trades and occupations carried on within themselves  There is still a wood near the Priory called  Tanner's wood    Registr B pag Here we find a lease of the parsonage of  Selborne  to  Thomas Sylvester  and  Miles Arnold  husbandmenof the tythes of all manner of corne pertaining to the parsonagewith the offerings at the chapel of  Whaddon  belonging to the said parsonage Dat  June    th    Hen    th  viz  As the chapel of  Whaddon  has never been mentioned till now and as it is not noticed by bishop  Tanner  in his  Notitia Monastica  some more particular account of it will be proper in this place  Whaddon  was a chapel of ease to the mother church of  Selborne  and was situated in the tithing of  Oakhanger  at about two miles distance from the village The farm and field whereon it stood are still called  chapel farm  and  field  This is a manorfarm at present the property of  Lord Stawell  and belonged probably in ancient times to  Jo  de  Venur  or  Venuz  one of the first benefactors to the Priory  but there are no remains or traces of the building itself the very foundations having been destroyed before the memory of man In a farm yard at  Oakhanger  we remember a large hollow stone of a close substance which had been used as a  hogtrough  but was then broken This stone tradition said had been the baptismal font of  Whaddon chapel  The chapel had been in a very ruinous state in old days but was newbuilt at the instance of bishop  Wainfleet  about the year during the  first  priorship of  Berne  in consequence of a sequestration issued forth by that visitor against the Priory on account of notorious and shameful dilapidations  See Letter XIX of these Antiquities  "Summa total solut de novis edificationibus et reparacionibus per idem tempus ut patet per comput"  "Videlicet de nova edificat  Capelle Marie  de  Wadden  xiiii  lib  v  s  viii  d  Reparacionibus ecclesie Prioratus cancellor et capellar ecclesiarum et capellarum de  Selborne  et  Estworhlam  "  c c    The  Selborne  rivulet becomes of some breadth at  Oakhanger  and in very wet seasons swells to a large flood There is a bridge over the stream at this hamlet of considerable antiquity and peculiar shape known by the name of  Tunbridge  it consists of one single blunt  gothic  arch so high and sharp as to render the passage not very convenient or safe Here was also we find a bridge in very early times for  Jacobus de Hochangre  the first benefactor to the Priory of  Selborne  held his estate at  Hochangre  by the service of providing the king one footsoldier for forty days and by building this bridge  "  Jacobus de Hochangre  tenet  Hochangre  in com  Southampton per Serjantiam  Sargentia  a sort of tenure of doing something for the king  inveniendi unum valectum in exercitu Domini regis scil  Henrici  III  tii  per dies et ad faciendum  pontem  de  Hochangre  et valet per ann C s"  Blount's Ancient Tenures  p  A  dovehouse  was a constant appendant to a manerial dwelling of this convenience more will be said hereafter  A  cornmill  was also esteemed a necessary appendage of every manor and therefore was to be expected of course at the Priory of  Selborne  The prior had  secta molendini  or  ad molendinum  "Servitium quo seudatorii grana sua ad Domini molendinum ibi molenda perferre exconsuetudine astringuntur"  a power of compelling his vassals to bring their corn to be ground at his mill according to old custom He had also according to bishop  Tanner secta molendini de Strete  but the purport of  Strete  we must confess we do not understand  Strete  in old English signifies a road or highway as  Watling Strete  c therefore the prior might  have some mill on a high road The Priory had only one mill originally at  Selborne  but by grants of lands it came possessed of one at  Durton  and one at  Oakhanger  and probably some on it's other several manors  Thomas Knowles  president c ann  Hen  vi xxiii  o  viz demised to  J Whitelie  their mills c for twenty years Rent xxiii  s  iiii  d    Accepted Frewen  president c ann  Caroli  xv viz demised to  Jo Hook  and  Elizabeth  his wife the said mills Rent as above  The mill at the Priory was in use within the memory of man and the ruins of the millhouse were standing within these thirty years the pond and dam and miller's dwelling still remain As the stream was apt to fail in very dry summers the tenants found their situation very distressing for want of water and so were forced to abandon the spot This inconvenience was probably never felt in old times when the whole district was nothing but woodlands and yet several centuries ago there seem to have been two or three mills between  Wellhead  and the  Priory  For the reason of this assertion see Letter XXIX to Mr  Barrington  Occasional mention has been made of the many privileges and immunities enjoyed by the convent and it's priors but a more particular state seems to be necessary The author therefore thinks this the proper place before he concludes these antiquities to introduce all that has been collected by the judicious bishop  Tanner  respecting the Priory and it's advantages in his  Notitia Monastica  a book now seldom seen on account of the extravagance of it's price and being but in few hands cannot be easily consulted  A few days after this was written a new edition of this valuable work was announced in the month of  April  of the year as published by Mr  Nasmith  He also adds a few of it's many privileges from other authoritiesthe account is as follows  Tanner  page  SELEBURNE  A priory of  black canons  founded by the

to say respecting the present state of that convent and it's  Grange  and other matters he does not see how he can acquit himself of the subject without trespassing again on the patience of the reader by adding one supplementary letter  No sooner did the Priory perhaps much out of repair at the time become an appendage to the college but it must at once have tended to swift decay  Magdalen College  wanted now only two chambers for the chantry priest and his assistant and therefore had no occasion for the hall dormitory and other spacious apartments belonging to so large a foundation The roofs neglected would soon become the possession of daws and owls and being rotted and decayed by the weather would fall in upon the floors so that all parts must have hastened to speedy dilapidation and a scene of broken ruins Three full centuries have now passed since the dissolution a series of years that would craze the stoutest edifices But besides the slow hand of time many circumstances have contributed to level this venerable structure with the ground of which nothing now remains but one piece of a wall of about ten feet long and as many feet high which probably was part of an outhouse As early as the latter end of the reign of  Hen  VII  we find that a farmhouse and two barns were built to the south of the Priory and undoubtedly out of it's materials Avarice again has much contributed to the overthrow of this stately pile as long as the tenants could make money of it's stones or timbers Wantonness no doubt has had a share in the demolition for boys love to destroy what men venerate and admire A remarkable instance of this propensity the writer can give from his own knowledge When a schoolboy more than fifty years ago he was eyewitness perhaps a party concerned in the undermining a portion of that fine old ruin at the north end of  Basingstoke  town well known by the name of  Holy Ghost Chapel  Very providentially the vast fragment which these thoughtless little engineers endeavoured to sap did not give way so soon as might have been expected but it fell the night following and with such violence that it shook the very ground and awakening the inhabitants of the neighbouring cottages made them start up in their beds as if they had felt an earthquake The motive for this dangerous attempt does not so readily appear perhaps the more danger the more honour thought the boys and the notion of doing some mischief gave a zest to the enterprize As  Dryden  says upon an other occasion  "It look'd so like a sin it pleas'd the more"  Had the Priory been only levelled to the surface of the ground the discerning eye of an antiquary might have ascertained it's  ichnography  and some judicious hand might have developed it's dimensions But besides other ravages the very foundations have been torn up for the repair of the highways so that the site of this convent is now become a rough rugged pasturefield full of  hillocks and pits choaked with nettles and dwarfelder and trampled by the feet of the ox and the heifer  As the tenant at the Priory was lately digging among the foundations for materials to mend the highways his labourers discovered two large stones with which the farmer was so pleased that he ordered them to be taken out whole One of these proved to be a large  Doric  capital worked in good taste and the other a base of a pillar both formed out of the soft freestone of this district These ornaments from their dimensions seem to have belonged to massive columns and shew that the church of this  convent  was a large and costly edifice They were found in the space which has always been supposed to have contained the south transept of the Priory church Some fragments of large pilasters were also found at the same time The diameter of the capital was two feet three inches and an half and of the column where it had stood on the base eighteen inches and three quarters  Two years ago some labourers digging again among the ruins founded a sort of rude thick vase or urn of soft stone containing about two gallons in measure on the verge of the brook in the very spot which tradition has always pointed out as having been the site of the convent kitchen This clumsy utensil  A judicious antiquary who saw this vase observed that it possibly might have been a standard  measure  between the monastery and it's tenants The priory we have mentioned claimed the assize of bread and beer in  Selborne  manor and probably the adjustment of dry measures for grain c  whether intended for holy water or whatever purpose we were going to procure but found that the labourers had just broken it in pieces and carried it out on the highways  The Priory of  Selborne  had possessed in this village a  Grange  an usual appendage to manerial estates where the fruits of their lands were stowed and laid up for use at a time when men took the natural produce of their estates in kind The mansion of this spot is still called the  Grange  and is the manorhouse of the convent possessions in this place The author has conversed with very ancient people who remembered the old original  Grange  but it has long given place to a modern farmhouse  Magdalen College  holds a courtleet and courtbaron  The time when this court is held is the midweek between  Easter  and  Whitsuntide  in the great wheatbarn of the said  Grange  annually where the  President  usually superintends attended by the  bursar  and  steward  of the college  Owen Oglethorpe  president c an  Edw Sexti  primo viz demised  Robert Arden Selborne Grange  for twenty years Rent viii  Index of Leases  The following uncommon presentment at the court is not unworthy of notice There is on the south side of the king's field a large commonfield so called a considerable tumulus or hillock now covered with thorns and bushes and known by the name of  Kite's Hill  which is presented year by year in court as not ploughed Why this injunction is still kept up respecting this spot which is surrounded on all sides by arable land may be a question not easily solved since the usage has long survived the knowledge of the intention thereof We can only suppose that as the prior besides  thurset  and  pillory  had also  furcas  a power of life and death that he might have reserved this little eminence as the place of execution for delinquents And there is the more reason to suppose so since a spot just by is called  Gally  Gallows hill  The lower part of the village next the  Grange  in which is a pond and a stream is well known by the name of  Gracious street  an appellation not at all understood There is a lake in  Surrey  near  Chobham  called also  Graciouspond  and another if we mistake not near  Hedleigh  in the county of  Hants  This strange denomination we do not at all comprehend and conclude that it may be a corruption from some  Saxon  word itself perhaps forgotten  It has been observed already that Bishop  Tanner  was mistaken when he refers to an evidence of Dodsworth  "  De mercatu et  FERIA  de Seleburne  "  Selborne  never had a chartered fair the present fair was set up since the year by a set of jovial fellows who had found in an old almanack that there had been a fair here in former days on the first of  August  and were desirous to revive so joyous a festival Against this innovation the vicar set his face and persisted in crying it down as the probable occasion of much intemperance However the fair prevailed but was altered to the twentyninth of  May  because the former day often interfered with wheatharvest On that day it still continues to be held and is become an useful mart for cows and calves Most of the lower housekeepers brew beer against this holiday which is dutied by the exciseman and their becoming victuallers for the day without a license is overlooked  Monasteries enjoyed all sorts of conveniencies within themselves Thus at the Priory a low and moist situation there were ponds and stews for their fish at the same place also and at the  Grange  Culver  as has been observed before is  Saxon  for a pigeon  in  Culvercroft  there were dovehouses and on the hill opposite to the  Grange  the prior had a warren as the names of  The Coneycrofts  and  Coneycroft Hanger  plainly testify  A warren was an usual appendage to a manor    Nothing has been said as yet respecting the tenure or holding of the  Selborne  estates  Temple  and  Norton  are manor farms and freehold as is the manor of  Chapel  near  Oakhanger  and also the estate at  Oakhangerhouse  and  Blackmoor  The  Priory  and  Grange  are leasehold under  Magdalen college  for twentyone years renewable every seven all the smaller estates in and round the village are copyhold of inheritance under the college except the little remains of the  Gurdonmanor  which had been of old leased out upon lives but have been freed of late by their present lord as fast as those lives have dropped  Selborne  seems to have derived much of it's prosperity from the near neighbourhood of the Priory For monasteries were of considerable advantage to places where they had their sites and estates by causing great resort by procuring markets and fairs by freeing them from the cruel oppression of forestlaws and by letting their lands at easy rates But as soon as the convent was suppressed the town which it had occasioned began to decline and the market was less frequented the rough and sequestered situation gave a check to resort and the neglected roads rendered it less and less accessible  That it had been a considerable place for size formerly appears from the largeness of the church which much exceeds those of the neighbouring villages by the ancient extent of the burying ground which from human bones occasionally dug up is found to have been much encroached upon by giving a name to the hundred by the old foundations and ornamented stones and tracery of windows that have been discovered on the northeast side of the village and by the many vestiges of disused fishponds still to be seen around it For ponds and stews were multiplied in the times of popery that the affluent might enjoy some  variety at their tables on fast days therefore the more they abounded the better probably was the condition of the inhabitants  More  PARTICULARS  respecting the  OLD FAMILY TORTOISE  omitted in the  Natural History  BECAUSE we call this creature an abject reptile we are too apt to undervalue his abilities and depreciate his powers of instinct Yet he is as Mr  Pope  says of his lord  "Much too wise to walk into a well"  and has so much discernment as not to fall down an haha but to stop and withdraw from the brink with the readiest precaution  Though he loves warm weather he avoids the hot sun because his thick shell when once heated would as the poet says of solid armour  "scald with safety"  He therefore spends the more sultry hours under the umbrella of a large cabbageleaf or amidst the waving forests of an asparagusbed  But as he avoids heat in the summer so in the decline of the year he improves the faint autumnal beams by getting within the reflection of a fruitwall and though he never has read that planes inclining to the horizon receive a greater share of  warmth  Several years ago a book was written entitled  "Fruitwalls improved by inclining them to the horizon"  in which the author has shewn by calculation that a much greater number of the rays of the sun will fall on such walls than on those which are perpendicular  he inclines his shell by tilting it against the wall to collect and admit every feeble ray  Pitiable seems the condition of this poor embarrassed reptile to be cased in a suit of ponderous armour which he cannot lay aside to be imprisoned as it were within his own shell must preclude we should suppose all activity and disposition for enterprize Yet there is a season of the year usually the beginning of June when his exertions are remarkable He then walks on tiptoe and is stirring by five in the morning and traversing the garden examines every wicket and interstice in the fences through which he will escape if possible and often has eluded the care of the gardener and wandered to some distant field The motives that impel him to undertake these rambles seem to be of the amorous kind his fancy then becomes intent on sexual attachments which transport him beyond his usual gravity and induce him to forget for a time his ordinary solemn deportment  ADDITIONS TO LETTER XLI page  OF all the propensities of plants none seem more strange than their different periods of blossoming Some produce their flowers in the winter or very first dawnings of spring many when the spring is established some at midsummer and some not till autumn When we see the  helleborus foetidus  and  helleborus niger  blowing at Christmas the  helleborus hycmalis  in January and the  helleborus viridis  as soon as ever it emerges out of the ground we do not wonder because they are kindred plants that we expect should keep pace the one with the other But other congenerous vegetables differ so widely in their time of flowering that we cannot but admire I shall only instance at present in the  crocus sativus  the vernal and the autumnal crocus which have such an affinity that the best botanists only make them varieties of the same  genus  of which there is only one  species  not being able to discern any difference in the  corolla  or in the internal structure Yet the  vernal crocus  expands it's flowers by the beginning of March at farthest and often in very rigorous weather and cannot be retarded but by some violence offeredwhile the  autumnal  the  Saffron  defies the insluence of the spring and summer and will not blow till most plants begin to sade and run to seed This circumstance is one of the wonders of the creation little noticed because a common occurrence yet ought not to be overlooked on account  of it's being familiar since it would be as difficult to be explained as the most stupendous phaenomenon in nature  Say what impels amidst surrounding snow  Congeal'd the  crocus'  flamy bud to glow  Say what retards amidst the summer's blaze  Th'  autumnal bulb  till pale declining days  The GOD of SEASONS whose pervading power  Controls the sun or sheds the fleecy shower  He bids each flower his quick'ning word obey  Or to each lingering bloom enjoins delay  APPENDIX  No I  No  II  Carta Petri et conventus ecclesie Winton pro fundatione prioratus de Seleburne c dat    OMNIBUS Christi
