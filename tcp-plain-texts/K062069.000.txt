 THE SEDITIOUS INSECTS  OR THE Levellers Assembled IN CONVOCATION  A POEM  At cum Incerta volant caelo{que} Examina ludunt  Contemnunt{que} Favos frigida tecta relinquunt  Instabiles Animos ludo prohibebis Inani  Nec magnus prohibere labor Tu regibus alas  Eripe  Virg  Georg lib  IV  But when the Swarms are eager of their Play  And loath their Empty Hives and idly stray  Restrain the wanton Fugitives and take  A timely Care to bring the Truants back  The Task is easie But to clip the Wings  Of their Highflying Arbitrary Kings  Dryden  LONDON Printed and Sold by  Benj Bragg  at the  Raven  in  PaterNosterRow    THE Seditious Insects  c  NEAR the Cool Verge of that Delightful Strand  Where winding  Thames  rowls over Golden Sand  Where Western Breezes fan the Gentle Air  And  Britain  's brightest Ornaments appear  An Ancient Hive of  Aristaean  Bees  With pleasure swarm'd among the Fragrant Trees  Long did their Labours o'er the Land diffuse  Aerial Honey and Ambrosial Dews  Collected from the Meads and Rosie Bowers  And Morning Sweets that tip the gaudy Flowers  Of their gay Pride despoiling every Plain  To feed with Heavenly Juice the humble Swain  And load with labour'd Sweets the flowing Land again  Safe was their Hive from all oppressive Harms  No Dreams of Danger discompos'd their Swarms  But fam'd for Peace and Order they were known  True Bees due Homage to Superiours own  This was their State when busie Moths arose  And Wasps Insidious equally their Foes  Hornets and Drones and all the humming Tribe  Whom Hate cou'd Summon or whom Int'rest Bribe  Gnats Beetles Locusts all the Worthless kind  Of hateful Insects in the Riot join'd  Buzzing false Dangers and distracting Fears  In new Confusions now the Hive appears  Customs unknown to Ages heretofore  Corrupt the Breed the Virgin Race deflow'r  So when False Teachers in the Church arise  Schism prevails and true Religion dies  Faith takes her flight unable to sustain  The Mighty Shock Reason perswades in vain  Till Heavenly Energy our Breast inspires  With Sacred Sense of true Etherial Fires  Then the dark Clouds of Errour fly apace  And Revelation reassumes her Place  Now the warm Foe their  Io Paeans  sing  In every Vale loud Peals of Conquest ring  The painted Butterfly with empty Sound  Proclaim'd the gaudy Triumph all around  Every vile Insect to the Hive repairs  Foments the Tumult and the Plunder Shares  Sated with Spoil with Victory elate  The Hostile Vermine whet their pointed Hate  Each Envious Thought they sooth and proudly drive  The Bees dejected from the Luscious Hive  When their Just King touch'd with a Princely Zeal  To save his Subjects and their Pressures heal  Gives up the Councellors who illadvis'd  And their Immoderate Enterprize chastis'd  Another Set of Ministers he chose  And freed the Hive from their Vexatious Foes  With Rays of Heavenly Light returning Peace  Smil'd on the Great Design and Crown'd it with Success  Such is the Power of Majesty Divine  When in full Lustre it vouchsafes to shine  The Rebel Brood struck with amazing Dread  In trembling Horror and Confusion fled  So have the Zealots of our Church appear'd  If Little Things may be with Great Compar'd  Busie with specious Dangers to amuse  With Patriots Fears the Populace abuse  When 'twas the Churches Honey rais'd the Cry  Join'd with the Sweetness of the Ministry  Had they still loll'd in Soft Luxurious Ease  The Church had flourish'd in Triumphant Peace  The  Synods  too been Safe secure from Harm  Tho' even in them some Holy Vermin swarm  O say Bright Goddess whence this Temper flows  And show how first the Fatal Schism rose  Long has the Papal Power aspir'd to reign  With Universal sway Why will they strive in vain  Some Angel still by a Divine Command  Will interpose to save the British Land  Successive Plots and Jesuitick Wiles  Open Attempts and seeming Friendly Smiles  Have in their Turns with the same vile Intent  Contriv'd the Ruin of this Government  This to promote some Fathers heretofore  Lavish of Labour prodigal of Gore  Fain wou'd their Hands in Royal Blood imbrue  And bless'd the Deed as Meritorious too  Since the Libation to the Church was due  This Sainted Herd this Vile Deceiving Race  Now in Rich  Fresco  at  See Mr  Addison  's Remarks on Italy  Loretto  blaze  Where Speaking Marble do's their Story tell  This for the Faith that for Religion fell  When for the worst of Crimes the Hellish Breed  Did by the Justest Law of Nations Bleed  Such Saints as These  England  too much has known  Who  Clemens  and  Ravilliac  's Maxims own  Kingkilling Doctrines and Deposing Crowns  Too oft have been the Theme of Servile Gowns  Peters  and  Ferguson  may surely claim  A Share with  Garnet  in Immortal Fame  Lacy  and  Marion  too in time may vie  With either kind for Gifts and Prophecy  The same Seditious Spirit forms their Will  For Mischief Arm'd alike with Blind Ungovern'd Zeal  Whole Ages have such Emissaries try'd  This much too fickle Nation to divide  With open Violence In Eightyeight  They lead their easie King and rid the yielding State  Law fell before their Arbitrary Sway  And now they Smil'd and Bless'd the Happy Day  When  British  Liberty no more shou'd stand  In opposition to Supream Command  Thus were we crush'd by the Intrigues of  Rome    Till Glorious  Nassau  had revers'd our Doom  He came to save us with extended Arms  Restore our Laws and break the Tyrants Charms  Rescue the Church from her insulting Foes  And leave the Nation in a Blest Repose  This done he fled to his Congenial Sphere  And shines upon the Land a Bright Auspicious Star  Forgive Immortal  Hero  if my Muse  Conscious of Weakness her own Theme pursues  Nor aims to Praise so Excellent a King  None but a  Virgil  shou'd a  Caesar  Sing  With Mortal Pangs they saw the  Romish  Yoke  Thus by our Happy Revolution broke  By open force despairing to succeed  On New Designs their Factious Agents lead  Various Intrigues their Cursed Engines try  No Difficulties daunt their Industry  But what the Sword denies they attempt by Prophecy  Earth Hell and Seas they'll compass to deceive  And Glory in the Toil if  Proselites  believe  So when Imperial  Juno  had implor'd  The Thunderer's Aid to crush the  Trojan  Lord  The Awful God denying her Request  Told her  Aeneas  must in  Latium  rest  But she Impatient by strong Passion mov'd  So much a Female Jesuit she prov'd  Besought the Powers beneath to be her Friends  And went to Hell to gain her Pious Ends  Sure 'twas from thence this Gifted Spirit came  No Heavenly Fire but an Infernal Flame  Design'd by  Jesuits  to destroy Our Ease  And pall the Joys of our United Peace  For this Seditious Spirits in disguise  Swarm in the Church tho' they that Church despise  Loudly they boast her Ancient Rights and Fame  Whilst underhand they play a Popish Game  The Seed of  Loyold  with Artful Pains  First fixt this HighChurch Poyson in our Veins  Infecting too too many of our Youth  Who blindly led fell from the Cause of Truth  Isis  no more can boast of healing Streams  The Deity has long withdrawn his Beams  Displeas'd that they polluted his Abode  That HighChurch Victims now his Altars load  And Priests no Incense offer worthy of a God  Hence we derive the Cause of all our Woes  From hence the Dangers of the Church arose  Hence empty  Libertines  with Modish Air  At Myst'ry laugh and all Religion jeer  When Fountains are corrupt how can the Streams be clear  So when at  Athens  the Degenerate Race  Left their old Morals new Ones to Embrace  The Guardian Deities their Shrines forsook  In vain the Victims on their Altars smoak  In vain the Fragrant Gums in Spheres ascend  Th'unhallow'd Incense did but more offend  Then Highflown Priests their new Distinctions brought  And Faction for Religion first was taught  Then Piety and Ancient Faith decay'd  And  Synod  Men the Churches Right betray'd  Then Vice and Vertue were in Schools defin'd  As the Declaiming Stagyrite inclin'd  But Truth abandon'd did in Secret Mourn  And begg'd the Blooming Goddess to return  O say Celestial Muse the Reason tell  Why in those Heavenly Men such Passions dwell  Why those who preach Religion Zeal profess  And for the Church such Flaming Love confess  Shall in vile Terms of their Superiors speak  Slight their Authority their Orders break  In open Disobedience live and rail  And hope by Innovations to prevail  With Intermediate Sessions why confound  The Churches Peace the Convocation wound  By Rights Usurp'd why Presbyters prepare  Their Primate's Power without Consent to share  And fill without his leave the Prolocutor's Chair  Why to their Members they pretend to give  Commissions to absent Why grant 'em leave  And by what Right with what assuming Face  They substitute their Proxies in their Place  Why Actuaries they chose But with intent  T'infringe the Power of their President  Whose most Undoubted Right 'thas always been  As well for to Prorogue as to Convene  T'appoint his Register of Deputation  To act in either House or Convocation  And why such grateful Thoughts these Men retain  Of the Transcendent Mildness of this Reign  So warmly to oppose the Lords Address  The Bishops Address of Thanks refused by the LowerHouse  Where in the Humblest Terms they did express  Their Thanks to Heaven for that Illustrious Queen  In whom such Wondrous Piety is seen  Whose unexampled Bounty has declar'd  How much the Churches Welfare she rever'd  Such true diffusive Charity reveals  What Sense of Goodness in her Soul she feels  A Charity which in its Nature shews  Heaven for its Birthplace where it first arose  From whence descending to her Royal Breast  The Radiant Virtue Kind'red Flames Confest  And own'd the Bright Abode worthy the Godlike Guest  For me the first Desire which does Controul  The Secret Springs which move my rising Soul  Is that her Glorious Reign I might rehearse  In equal Numbers and distinguish'd Verse  But far O far above the Poet's Flame  Is her Bright Story and Immortal Name  Cou'd I like  H  x  in lasting Strains  Transcend the  Mantuan  or  Moeonian  Swains  Then shou'd her more than Mortal Vertue shine  And Heavenly Eloquence adorn each Line  Then shou'd my Happy Muse record her Fame  And  ANNA  's Glory be my endless Theme  But whether does the Ravish'd Muse Aspire  Not  Phoebus  boasts a more exalted Fire  Or touches with more Art the sweetly sounding Lyre  In vain our Monarch labours to engage  With all her Clemency these Men of Rage  Who their Defect of Duty wou'd supply  By wrangling for their Independency  Who without Precedent insist to use  Forms of their own and their own Methods chuse  Tho' former Synods always in like Case  Comply'd with the Directions of his Grace  And Suffragans but these too Wise are grown  T'acknowledge Duty or Dependance own  These claim a Right Coordinate with theirs  And Model as they please the Church Affairs  So  Puritans  of Old in the same Strain  Did of the Bishops Legal Pow'r complain  A Presbyterian Parity they taught  In the same Language which by these is brought  To vindicate the Lower House's Claim  By Advocates of the same Strength and Fame  This Levelling Contention to promote  Full many then as well as now have wrote  Tho' none with more Asperity appears  Than Gifted  Urim  void of Filial Fears  He treats the Bishops with the same regard  As if he for Presbytery declar'd  Such foul Mistakes such groundless Calumnies  Occur in all this  Vide  Bedmaker University  Sunburnt Author says  That Charity apart one might believe  He did from Hell his Influence receive  With Scorn of others full of Selfconceit  This Scribler undertook the Grand Debate  Misrepresenting every thing that made  Against his Cause and did with Art evade  The Force of Truth as if deceiving was his Trade  Thus to his Cause he Courted Partial Praise  With all the Sophistry his Wit cou'd raise  But whilst his Eloquence profusely Toils  Old  Anarchy  reviews his former Spoils  Pleas'd with the Thought the Shapeless Monster Smiles  Here the Episcopate in mournful hue  Appears there falling Mitres strike the view  For this Incestuous Twigg in Zealous Strains  Of President and UpperHouse complains  Quarrels with Bishops Rights and Dignities  Since the Coy Lawn his fond Embraces flies  For this Bold  B  s  in that dark Orb declaims  He both the Church and Churches Head Blasphemes  No Sense of Piety or Grace restrain  The Heterodox Effusions of his Brain  Who for his Party sticks at no Abuse  But for the Cause will even his  A th of  January  Sermon where he lessens Christ to extol the Martyr  God traduce  Elaborate  H  with the same Intent  Engages in this weighty Argument  But of Bright Truth afraid he soon retreats  Still safe behind some puzzling Theme he gets  Where in round Periods and Sonorous Words  A Barren Entertainment he affords  No Cogent Reas'nings in his Thoughts abound  His Sense in Fairy Circles dances round  And never is without some Labour found  Nay tho' the M  dignifies his Brows  He still their Levelling Designs avows  With flagrant Marks of most Irreverend Spleen  Loose  S  n  is in his Letter seen  There Inbred Calumny and Native Spight  Wrangle by turns for LowerHouse's Right  There HighChurch Zeal defends Fanatick Claim  Soft'ning Sedition by a milder Name  To save the Church with Scorn her Fathers Treats  Such Rage of Schism in his Bosom beats  So Patriots of old to save the Crown  Destroy'd its Power first then pull'd their Sovereign down  Against Conviction and the clearest Light  Of Sacred Truth did railing  N  m  write  With Artificial Strokes of Party Skill  He gilds their Errors with the Name of Zeal  And the deluded Herd believe the lying Oracle  To such mean Shifts those Scribblers must descend  Who an ill Cause avowedly defend  Among these Champions  A  too appears  With  Vide  Oxford Alman  Hieroglyphics  of the Parties Fears  No wonder they the Church's Danger see  Who wou'd destroy the Church's Polity  Pull down her Bishops and their Rights betray  And modelize the Church the shortest Way  What wou'd the Parliament of Fortyone  Have given for such a Convocation  Such Levellers as these such Sons of Zeal  Sure at that time must have succeeded well  When every Schismatick and gifted Saint  Who cry'd down Bishops Pow'r in sawcy Cant  Found such Rewards and such Encouragement  Wise  Against Episcopacy and Church Discipline  Pennington  's Petition had appear'd  More Just if Presbyters like these had shar'd  In the Church  Hierarchy  with less Disgrace  Sacred Episcopists had yeilded Place  T' Inferiour Clergy of Reforming Race  These are the Insects which the Hive infest  And these give Life and Motion to the rest  Numerous Meetings of the lesser Fry  Take Influence from these to raise the Cry  Of Danger to the Church from too assuming Prelacy  Not far from that most Celebrated Hall  Where the Rich Trophies of the Conquer'd  Gaul    The Glory of the  British  Host display  And show the Wonders of that dreadful Day  When  Marlbro  ' great in Arms the Foe subdu'd  And stopp'd with Heaps of Slain

Drunk with Priest Wine new Dangers they perceive  And for the Church in strong  Gallicia  grieve  To rail secure and fence against Alarms  They shift and vary their industrious Swarms  Now the  Three

Oh What Numbers shall the Sprightly Muse  Equal to Great  God  n  's Wisdom chuse  What Happy Strains his  Management  disclose  Ador'd by Friends and even rever'd by Foes  Too weak alas is her

Thunder yet appear  Nor more amazing  Premunire  's scare  No Censures interrupt the soft Repose  Of his Rebellious and Insulting Foes  Like the Good Queen he all Forgiveness seems  And the foul Rancour of their Spight contemns  So when his Glorious Master was abus'd  By railing  Jews  by their HighChurch traduc'd  Mildly he did their Insolence reprove  For Murd'rous Hate he show'r'd down Heavenly Love  And Healing Moderation from above  FINIS
