facilitate their reasonings and employing general theorems are enabled to comprehend in a few propositions an infinite number of inferences and conclusions History also being a collection of facts which are multiplying without end is obliged to adopt such arts of abridgement to retain the more material events and to drop all the minute circumstances  which are only interesting during the time or to the persons engaged in the transactions This truth is no where more evident than with regard to the reign upon which we are going to enter What mortal could have the patience to write or read a long detail of such frivolous events as those with which it is filled or attend to a tedious narrative which would follow thro' a series of fifty six years the caprices and weaknesses of so mean a prince as Henry The chief reason why protestant writers have been so anxious to spread out the incidents of this reign is in order to expose the rapacity ambition and artifices of the court of Rome and to prove that the great dignitaries of the catholic church while they pretended to have nothing in view but the salvation of souls had bent all their attention to the acquisition of riches and were restrained by no sense of justice or honour in the pursuit of that great object  M Paris p  But this conclusion would readily be allowed them tho' it were not illustrated by such a detail of uninteresting incidents and follows indeed by an evident necessity from the very situation in which that church was placed with regard to the rest of Europe For besides that all ecclesiastical power as it can always cover its operations under a cloak of sanctity and attacks men on the side where they dare not employ their reason lies less under controul than civil government besides this general cause I say the Pope and his courtiers were foreigners to most of the churches which they governed they could not possibly have any other object but to pillage the provinces for present gain and as they lived at a distance they would be little awed by shame or remorse in practising every lucrative expedient which was suggested to them England being one of the most remote provinces attached to the Romish hierarchy as well as one of the richest and the most prone to superstition felt severely during this reign while its patience was not yet fully exhausted the influence of these causes and we shall often have occasion to touch cursorily upon such incidents But we shall not attempt to comprehend every transaction transmitted to us and till the end of the reign when the events become more memorable we shall not always observe an exact chronological order in our narration  Settlement of the government  THE earl of Pembroke who at the time of John's death was marischal of England was by his office at the head of the armies and consequently during a state of civil wars and convulsions at the head of the state and it happened fortunately for the young monarch and for the nation that the power could not have been intrusted into more able and more faithful hands This nobleman who had maintained his loyalty unshaken to John during the lowest fortune of that monarch determined to support the authority of the infant prince and he  was not dismayed with the number and violence of his enemies  th Oct  Sensible that Henry according to the prejudices of the times would not be deemed sovereign till crown'd and anointed by a churchman he immediately carried the young prince to Glocester where the ceremony of coronation was performed in the presence of Gualo the legate and a very few noblemen by the bishops of Winchester and Bath  M Paris p Hist Croys Cont p W Heming p Trevet p  As the concurrence of the papal authority was requisite to support the tottering throne Henry was obliged to swear fealty to the Pope and renew that homage to which his father had already subjected the kingdom  M Paris p    th Nov  And in order to enlarge the authority of Pembroke and give him a more regular and legal title to it a general council of the barons was soon after summoned at Bristol where that nobleman was chosen protector of the kingdom  PEMBROKE that he might reconcile all men to the government of his pupil made him grant anew a charter of liberties which tho' mostly copied from the former concessions extorted from John contains some alterations which may be deemed remarkable  Rymer Vol p  The full privilege of elections in the clergy granted by John the former King was not confirm'd nor the liberty of going out of the kingdom without the royal consent Whence we may conjecture that Pembroke and the barons jealous of the ecclesiastical power were desirous of renewing the King's claim to issue a congè d'elire to the monks and chapters and thought it requisite to put some check on the frequent appeals to Rome But what may chiefly surprize us the obligation to which John had subjected himself of obtaining the consent of the great council before he levied any aids or scutages from the nation was omitted and this article was even declared hard and severe and was expressly left to future deliberation But we must consider that tho' this limitation may perhaps appear to us the most momentous in the whole charter of John it was not regarded in that light by the antient barons who were more jealous of particular acts of violence in the crown than of such general impositions which unless they were evidently reasonable and necessary could scarce without a general consent be levied upon men who had arms in their hands and who could repel any act of oppression by which they were all immediately affected We accordingly find that Henry in the course of his reign while he gave frequent occasions for complaint with regard to the violations of the great charter never once attempted by his mere will to levy any aids or scutages though he was often reduc'd to great necessities and was refused supplies by his people So much easier was it for him to transgress the  law when individuals alone were affected than even to exert his acknowledged prerogatives where the interest of the whole body was concerned  This charter was again confirmed by the King in the ensuing year with the addition of some articles to prevent the oppressions of sheriffs And also with an additional charter of forests a circumstance of great moment in those ages when hunting was so much the occupation of the nobility and when the King comprehended so considerable a part of the kingdom within his forests which he govern'd by peculiar and arbitrary laws All the forests which had been enclosed since the reign of Henry the second were desaforested and new perambulations were appointed for that purpose Offences in the forests were declared to be no longer capital but punishable by fines imprisonments and more gentle penalties And all the proprietors of land recovered the power of cutting and using their own wood at their pleasure  THUS these famous charters were brought very nearly to the shape in which they have ever since stood and they were during many generations the darling of the whole English nation and esteemed the most sacred rampart to national liberty and independance As they secured the rights of all orders of men they were regarded with a jealous eye by all and became the basis in a manner of the English monarchy and a kind of original contract which both limited the authority of the King and ensured the conditional allegiance of his subjects Tho' often violated they were still claimed and recalled by the nobility and people and as no precedents were supposed valid that infringed them they rather acquired than lost authority from the frequent attempts made against them in several ages by regal and arbitrary power  WHILE Pembroke by renewing and confirming the great charter gave so much satisfaction and security to the nation in general he also applied himself successfully to individuals and wrote letters in the King's name to all the malecontent barons in which he represented to them that whatever jealousy and animosity they might have entertained against the late King a young prince the lineal heir of their antient monarchs had now fucceeded to the throne without succeeding either to the resentments or principles of his predecessor That the desperate expedient which they had employed of calling in a foreign potentate had happily for them as well as for the nation failed of entire success and it was still in their power by a quick return to their duty to restore the independance of the kingdom and to secure that liberty for which they so zealously contended That as all past offences of the barons were now buried in oblivion they ought on their part to forget their complaints against their late sovereign who if he had been any wise blameable in his conduct had left to his son the  salutary warning to avoid the paths which had led to such fatal extremities And that having now obtained a charter for their liberties it was their interest to show by their conduct that that acquisition was not incompatible with their allegiance and that the rights of King and people so far from being hostile and opposite might mutually support and sustain each other  Rymer vol p Brady's App N  o      THESE considerations enforced by the character of constancy and fidelity which Pembroke had ever maintained had a mighty influence on the barons and most of them began secretly to negotiate with him and many of them openly returned to their duty The diffidence which Lewis discovered of their fidelity forwarded this general propension towards the King and when the French prince refused the government of the castle of Hertford to Robert FitzWalter who had been so active against the late King and who claimed that fortress as his right and property they all plainly saw that the English were excluded from every trust and that foreigners had engrossed all the confidence and affection of their new sovereign  M Paris p  The excommunication too denounced by the legate against all Lewis's adherents failed not in the turn which mens dispositions had taken to operate a mighty effect upon them and they were easily persuaded to consider a cause as impious and profane for which they had already entertained an unsurmountable aversion  M Paris p M West p  Tho' Lewis made a journey to France and brought over fresh succours from that kingdom  Chron Dunst vol p M West p  he found on his return that his party was still more weakened by the desertion of his English confederates and that the death of John had contrary to his expectation given an incurable blow to his cause The earls of Salisbury Arundel and Warrenne together with William Mareshal eldest son of the protector had embraced Henry's party and every English nobleman was plainly watching an opportunity of returning to his allegiance Pembroke was so much strengthened by these accessions that he ventured to invest Mountsorel tho' upon the approach of the count de Perche with the French army he desisted from his enterprize and raised the siege  M Paris p  The count de Perche elated with this success marched to Lincoln' and being admitted into the town he began to attack the castle which he soon reduced to extremity The protector summoned all his forces from every quarter in order to relieve a place of such importance and he appeared so much superior to the French that they shut themselves up within the city and resolved to take shelter behind the walls  Chron Dunst vol p  But the garrison of the castle having received  a strong reinforcement made a vigorous sally upon the besiegers while the English army by concert assaulted them in the same instant from without mounted the walls by scalade and bearing down all resistance entered the city sword in hand Lincoln was delivered over to be pillaged the French army was totally routed the count de Perche with only two persons more was killed but many of the chief commanders and about knights were made prisoners by the English  M Paris p Chron de Mullr p  So little b ood was shed in this important action which decided the fate of one of the most powerful kingdoms of Europe and such wretched soldiers were those antient barons who yet were unacquainted with every thing but arms  Prince Lewis was informed of this fatal event while employed in the siege of Dover which was still valiantly defended against him by Hubert de Burgh He immediately retreated towards London which was the center and life of his party and he there received intelligence of a new disaster which put an end to all his hopes A French fleet bringing over a strong reinforcement had appeared on the coast of Kent when they were attacked by the English under the command of Philip d'Albiney and were routed and repulsed with considerable loss D' Albiney practised a stratagem against them which is said to have contributed to the victory Having gained the wind of the French he came down upon them with violence and throwing in their faces a great quantity of quicklime which he purposely carried on board he so blinded them that they were disabled from defending themselves  M Paris p Ann Warerl p W Heming p Trevet p M West p Knyghton p    AFTER this second misfortune of the French the English barons hasted every where to make terms of peace with the protector and by an early submission to prevent those forfeitures to which they were exposed on account of their rebellion Lewis whose cause was now totally desperate began to be anxious for the safety of his person and was glad on any honourable conditions to make his escape from a country where he found that every thing was now become hostile to him He concluded a peace with Pembroke promised to evacuate the kingdom and only stipulated in return an indemnity to his adherents and a restitution of their honours and fortunes together with the free and equal enjoyment of those liberties which had been granted to the rest of the nation  Rymer vol p M Paris p Chron Dunst vol p M West p Knyghton p    General pacification  Thus was happily ended a civil war which seemed to be founded on the most incurable hatred and jealously and threatened the kingdom with the most fatal consequences  THE precautions which the King of France used in the conduct of this whole affair are remarkable He pretended that his son had accepted of the offer from the English barons without his advice and contrary to his inclination The armies sent to England were levied in Lewis's name When that prince came over to France for aid his father publickly refused to grant him any assistance and would not so much as admit him to his presence Even after Henry's party acquired the ascendant and Lewis was in danger of falling into the hands of his enemies it was Blanche of Castile his wife not the King his father who raised armies and equipped fleets for his succour  M Paris p Chron Dunst vol p  All these artifices were employed not to satisfy the Pope for he had too much penetration to be so easily imposed on Nor yet to deceive the people for they were too gross even for that purpose They only served for a colouring to Philip's cause and in public affairs men are often better pleased that the truth tho' known to every body should be wrapt up under a decent cover than if it were exposed in open daylight to the eyes of all the world  After the expulsion of the French the prudence and equity of the protector's subsequent conduct contributed to cure entirely those wounds which had been made by intestine discord He received the rebellious barons into favour observed strictly the terms of peace which he had granted them restored them to their possessions and endeavoured by an equal behaviour to bury all past animosities in perpetual oblivion The clergy alone who had adhered to Lewis were sufferers in this revolution As they had rebelled against their sovereign the Pope by disregarding the interdict and excommunication it was not in Pembroke's power to make any stipulations in their favour and Gualo the legate prepared to take vengeance on them for their disobedience  Brady's App N  o  Chron Dunst vol p  Many of them were deposed many suspended some banished and all who escaped punishment made atonement for their offences by paying large sums to the legate who amassed an immense treasure by this expedient  Death of the protector  THE earl of Pembroke survived not long the pacification which had been chiefly owing to his wisdom and valour  M Paris p  and he was succeeded in the government by Peter bishop of Winchester a Poicteven and Hubert de Burgh high justiciary The councils of the latter were chiefly followed and had he possessed equal authority in the kingdom with Pembroke he seemed to be every way worthy of filling the place of that virtuous citizen  Some commotions  But the licentious and powerful barons who had once broke the reins of subjection to their prince and  had obtained by violence an enlargement of their liberties and independance could ill be restrained by laws under a Minority and the people no less than the King suffered from their outrages and disorders They retained by force the royal castles which they had usurped during the past convulsions or which had been committed to their custody by the protector  p  They usurped the demesnes  Rymer vol p  They oppressed their vassals They infested their weaker neighbours And they invited all disorderly people to enter in their retinue and to live upon their lands and they gave them protection in all their robberies and extortions  No one was more infamous for these violent and illegal practices than the earl of Albemarle who tho' he had early returned to his duty and had been very serviceable in expelling the French augmented to the outmost of his power the ge eral licence which prevailed and committed outrages in all the counties of the north In order to suppress his disorders Hubert seized an opportunity of getting possession of Rockingham castle which Albemarle had garrisoned with his licentious retinue But this nobleman instead of submitting entered into a secret confederacy with Fawkes de Breaute Peter de Mauleon and other barons and both fortified the castle of Biham for his defence and made himself master by surprize of that of Fotheringay Pandulf who was restored to his legateship in the place of Gualo was active in suppressing this rebellion and with the concurrence of eleven bishops he denounced the sentence of excommunication against Albemarle and his adherents  Chron Dunst vol p  An army was levied A scutage of ten shillings a knight's fee was imposed on all the military tenants Albemarle's associates gradually deserted him And he himself was obliged at last to submit to mercy He received a pardon and was restored to his whole estate  THIS impolitic lenity too frequent in those times was probably the result of a combination among the barons who never could endure to see the total ruin or one of their own order But it encouraged Fawkes de Breaute a man whom King John had raised from a low origin to persevere in the course of violence to which he had owed his fortune and to set at nought all law and justice When thirty five verdicts were at one time found against him on account of his violent expulsion of so many freeholders from their possessions he came to the court of justice with an armed force seized the judge who had pronounced the sentences and imprisoned him in Bedford castle He then levied open war against the King but being subdued and taken prisoner his life was grented him but his estate was confiscated and he was banished the kingdom  Rymer vol p  M Paris p Ann Waverl p Chron Dunst vol p  M West p      JUSTICE was executed with greater severity against disorders less premeditated which broke out in the city of London A frivolous emulation in a match of wrestling between the Londoners on the one hand and the inhabitants of Westminster and those of the neighbouring villages on the other occasioned this commotion The former rose in a body and pulled down some houses belonging to the abbot of Westminster But this riot which considering the tumultuous disposition familiar to that capital would have been little regarded seemed to become more serious by the symptoms which then broke out of the former attachment of the citizens to the French interest The populace in the tumult made use of the cry of war commonly employed by the French troops  mountjoy mountjoy God help us and our lord Lewis  The justiciary made enquiry into the disorder and finding one Constantine Fitz Arnulf to have been the ringleader an insolent man who justified his crime in Hubert's presence he proceeded against him by martial law and ordered him immediately to be hanged without trial or form of process He also cut off the feet of some of Constantine's accomplices  M Paris p Annal Waverl p Chron Dunst vol p    THIS act of power was complained of as an infringement of the great charter Yet the justiciary in a parliament summoned at Oxford for the great councils began about this time to receive that appellation made no scruple to grant in the King's name a renewal and confirmation of that charter When the assembly made application to the crown for this favour as a law in those times seemed to lose its validity if not frequently renewed William de Briewere one of the council of Regency was so bold as to say openly that these liberties were extorted by force and ought not to be observed But he was reprimanded by the archbishop of Canterbury and was not countenanced by the King or his chief ministers  M West p  A new confirmation was demanded and granted two years after and an aid amounting to a fifteenth of all moveables was given by the parliament in return for this indulgence  M Paris p Ann T Wykes p Chron Dunst vol p M West p Knyghton p  The King issued writs anew to the sheriffs commanding the observance of the charter but he inserted a remarkable clause in the writs that those who payed not the fifteenth should not for the future be entitled to the benefit of those liberties  Claus H m and m d    THE low state into which the crown was now fallen made it requisite for a good minister to be attentive to the preservation of the royal prerogatives as well as to the security of public liberty Hubert applied to the Pope who had always great authority in the kingdom and was now considered as its superior lord and desired him to issue a bull declaring the King to be of full age and entitled to  exercise in person all the acts of royalty  M Paris p  In consequence of this declaration the justiciary resigned into Henry's hands the two important fortresses of the Tower and Dover castle which had been entrusted to his custody and required the other barons to imitate his example They refused compliance The earls of Chester and Albemarle John Constable of Chester John de Lacy Brian de l'Isle and William de Cantel with some others even formed a conspiracy to surprize London and met in arms at Waltham with that intention But finding the King prepared for defence they desisted from their enterprize When summoned to court in order to answer for their conduct they scrupled not to appear and to confess their design But they told the King that they had no bad intentions against his person but only against Hubert de Burgh whom they were determined to remove from his office  Chron Dunst vol p  They appeared too formidable to be chastised and they were so little discouraged by the failure of their first enterprize that they met again in arms at Leicester in order to seize the King who then resided at Northampton But Henry informed of their purpose took care to be so well armed and attended that the barons found it dangerous to make the attempt and they sat down and kept their Christmas in his neighbourhood  M Paris p Chron Dunst vol p  The archbishop and the prelates finding every thing tend towards a civil war interposed with their authority and threatened the barons with the sentence of excommunication if they persisted in detaining the King's castles This menace at last prevailed Most of the fortresses were surrendered tho' the barons complained that Hubert's castles were soon after restored to him while the King still kept theirs in his own custody There are said to have been castles at that time in England  Coke's Comment on Mag Charta chap    It must be acknowledged that the influence of the prelates and the clergy was often of very great service to the public Tho' the religion of that age can merit no other name than that of superstition it served to unite together a body of men who had great sway over the people and who kept the community from falling to pieces from the factions and independant power of the nobles And what was of great consequence it threw a mighty authority into the hands of men who by their profession were averse to arms and violence who tempered by their mediation the general disposition towards military enterprizes and who still maintained even amidst the shock of arms those secret links without which it is impossible for human society to subsist  NOTWITHSTANDING these intestine commotions in England and the precarious authority of the crown Henry was obliged to carry on war in France and  he employed to that purpose the fifteenth which had been granted him by parliament Lewis the eighth who had succeeded to his father Philip instead of attending to Henry's claim who demanded the restitution of Normandy and the other provinces wrested from England made an irruption into Poictou took Rochelle  Rymer vol p Trivet p  after a long siege and seemed determined to expell the English from the few provinces which yet remained to them Henry sent over his uncle the earl of Salisbury together with his brother prince Richard to whom he had granted the earldom of Cornwal which had escheated to the crown Salisbury stopt the progress of Lewis's arms and retained the Poictevin and Gascon vassals in their allegiance But no military action of any moment was performed on either side The earl of Cornwal after two years stay in Guienne returned to England  THIS prince was no wise turbulent or factious in his disposition His ruling passion was to amass money in which he succeeded so well as to become the richest prince in Christendom Yet his attention to gain sometimes threw him into acts of violence and gave disturbance to the government There was a manor which formerly had belonged to the earldom of Cornwal but had been given away to Waleran de Ties before Richard had been invested with that dignity and while the earldom remained in the hands of the crown Richard claimed this manor and expelled the proprietor by force Waleran complained The King ordered his brother to do justice to the man and restore him to his rights The earl said that he would not submit to these orders till the cause was decided against him by the judgment of his peers Henry replied that it was first requisite to reinstate Waleran in possession before the cause could be tried and he reiterated his orders to the earl  M Paris p  We may judge of the state of the government when this affair was like to produce a civil war The earl of Cornwal finding Henry peremptory in his demands associated himself with the young earl of Pembroke who had married his sister and who was discontented on account of the King's requiring him to deliver up some royal castles which were in his custody These two noblemen took into their confederacy the earls of Chester Warenne Glocester Hereford Warwic and Ferrars who were all disgusted on a like account  M Paris p  The malecontents assembled an army which the King had not the power or courage to resist and he was obliged to give his brother satisfaction by grants of much greater importance than the manor which had been the first ground of the quarrel  M Paris p    THE character of the King as he grew to man's estate became every day better known and was found in every circumstance totally unqualified for maintaining  a proper sway among those turbulent barons whom the feudal constitution subjected to his authority Gentle humane and merciful even to a fault he seems to have been steady in no other circumstance of his character but to have received every impression from those who surrounded him and whom he loved for the time with the most imprudent and most unreserved affection Without activity or vigour he was unfit to conduct war without policy or art he was ill fitted to maintain peace His resentments tho' hasty and violent were not dreaded while he was found to drop them with such facility his friendships were little valued because they were neither derived from choice nor maintained with constancy A proper pageant of state in a regular monarchy where his ministers could have conducted all affairs in his name and by his authority but too feeble in those disorderly times to sway a scepter whose weight depended entirely on the firmness and dexterity of the hand which held it  Hubert de Burgh displaced  The ablest and most virtuous minister whom Henry ever possessed was Hubert de Burgh  Ypod Neustriae p  a man who had been steady to the crown in the most difficult and dangerous times and who yet shewed no disposition in the height of his power to enslave or oppress the people The only exceptionable part of his conduct is that which is mentioned by Matthew Paris  P M West p ascribes this council to Peter Bishop of Winchester  if the fact is really true and proceeded from Hubert's advice the recalling publickly and annulling the charter of forests a concession so reasonable in itself and so passionately claimed both by the nobility and people But it must be confessed that this measure is so unlikely both from the circumstances of the times and character of the minister that there is great reason to doubt of its reality especially as it is mentioned by no other historian Hubert while he enjoyed his authority had an entire ascendant over Henry and was loaded with honours and favours beyond any other subject Besides acquiring the property of many castles and manors he married the eldest sister of the King of Scots was created earl of Kent and by an unusual concession was made chief justiciary of England for life  Yet Henry in a sudden caprice threw off this faithful minister and exposed him to the violent persecutions of his enemies Among other frivolous crimes objected to him he was accused of gaining the King's affections by enchantment and of purloining from the royal treasury a gem which had the virtue to render the wearer invulnerable and of sending this valuable curiosity to the prince of Wales  M Paris p  The nobility who hated Hubert on account of his zeal in resuming the rights and possessions of the crown no sooner saw the opening than they inflamed the King's animosity against him and pushed him to seek the total  ruin of his minister Hubert took sanctuary in a church The King ordered him to be dragged from thence He recalled those orders He afterwards renewed them He was obliged by the clergy to restore him to the sanctuary He constrained him soon after to surrender himself prisoner and he confined him to the castle of the Devises Hubert made his escape was expelled the kingdom was again received into favour recovered a great share of the King's confidence but never showed any inclination of reinstating himself in his power and authority  M Paris p Chron T Wykes p Chron Dunst vol p M West p    Bishop of Winchester minister  THE man who succeeded him in the government of the King and kingdom' was Peter des Roches bishop of Winchester a Poictevin by birth who had been raised by the late King and who was no less distinguished by his arbitrary principles and violent conduct than by his courage and abilities This prelate had been left by King John justiciary and regent of the kingdom during an expedition which that prince made into France and his illegal administration was one chief cause of that great combination among the barons which finally extorted from the crown the charter of liberties and laid the foundation of the English constitution Henry tho' incapable from his character of pursuing the same violent maxims which had governed his father had imbibed the same arbitrary principles and in prosecution of Peter's advice he invited over a great number of Poictevins and other foreigners who he believed could more safely be trusted than the English and who seemed requisite to counterbalance the great and independant power of the nobility  M Paris p  Every office and command was bestowed on these strangers their rapacity exhausted the revenues of the crown already too much impoverished  Chron Dunst vol p  they invaded the rights of the people and their insolence still more provoking than their power drew on them the hatred and envy of all orders of men in the kingdom  M Paris p    THE barons formed a combination against this odious ministry and withdrew from their attendance in parliament on pretence of the danger to which they were exposed from the machinations of the Poictevins When again summoned to attend they gave for answer that the King should dismiss his foreigners from court Otherwise they would drive both him and them out of the kingdom and put the crown on another head more worthy of wearing it  M Paris p  Such was the style which they used to their sovereign They at last came to parliament but so well attended with armed followers that they seemed in a condition to prescribe laws to the King and ministry Peter des Roches however had in the interval found means of sowing dissension among the barons and of bringing over to his  party the earl of Cornwal as well as the earls of Lincoln and Chester The confederates were disconcerted in their measures Richard earl Marischal who had succeeded to that dignity on the death of his brother William was chaced into Wales he thence withdrew into Ireland where he was treacherously murdered by the contrivance of the bishop of Winchester  Chron Dunst vol p  The estates of the more obnoxious barons were confiscated without legal sentence or trial by their peers  M Paris p  and were bestowed with a profuse liberality on the Poictevins Peter even carried his insolence so far as to say publickly that the barons of England must not pretend to put themselves on the same footing with those of France or assume the same liberties and privileges The monarch had a more absolute power in the one country than in the other It would have been more justifiable for him to say that men so unwilling to submit to the authority of law could with the worse grace claim any shelter or protection from it  WHEN the King at any time was checked in his illegal practices and the authority of the great charter was objected to him he was wont to reply  "Why should I observe a charter which is neglected by all my grandees both prelates and nobility"  It was very reasonably replied  "You ought sir to set them the example"  M Paris p  So violent a ministry as that of the bishop of Winchester could not be of long duration but its fall proceeded at last from the influence of the church not from the efforts of the nobles Edmond the present primate came to court attended by many of the other prelates and represented to the King the pernicious measures embraced by Peter des Roches the discontents of his people the ruin of his affairs and after requiring the dismission of the minister and his associates threatened him with the sentence of excommunication in case of his refusal Henry who knew that an excommunication so agreeable to the sense of the people could not fail of operating the most dangerous effects was obliged to submit Foreigners were banished The natives were restored to their place in council  M Paris p Rymer vol p M Paris p  The primate who was a man of prudence and who took care to execute the laws and observe the charter of liberties bore the chief sway in the government  th January King's partia  ty to foreigners  BUT the English in vain flattered themselves that they would be long free from the dominion of foreigners The King having married Eleanor daughter to the count of Provence was surrounded by a great number of strangers from that country whom he caressed with the fondest affection and enriched by an imprudent  generosity  M Paris p M West p  The bishop of Valence a prelate of the house of Savoy and maternal uncle to the queen was his chief minister and employed every art to amass wealth for himself and his relations Peter de Savoy another borther of the same family was invested in the honour of Richmond and received the rich wardship of earl Warrenne Boniface de Savoy was promoted to the see of Canterbury Many young ladies were invited over from Provence and married to the chief noblemen of England who were the King's wards  M Paris p M West p  And as the source of Henry's bounty began to fail his Savoyard ministry applied to Rome and obtained a bull permitting him to resume all past grants absolving him from the oath which he had taken to maintain them even enjoining him to make such a resumption and representing these grants as invalid on account of the prejudice which ensued from them to the Roman pontiff in whom the superiority of the kingdom was vested  M Paris p  The opposition made to the intended resumption prevented it from taking effect but the nation saw the indignities to which the King was willing to submit in order to gratify the avarice of his foreign favourites About the same time he published in England the sentence of excommunication denounced against the emperor Frederic his brother in law  Rymer vol p  and said in excuse that being the Pope's vassal he was obliged by his allegiance to obey all the commands of his holiness In this weak reign when any neighbour insulted the King's dominions instead of taking revenge for the injury he complained to the Pope as his superior lord and begged him to give protection to his vassal  Chron Dunst vol p    Grievances  THE resentment of the English barons rose high at the preference given to foreigners but no remonstrances and complaints could ever prevail on the King to abandon them or even to moderate his attachment towards them After the Provençals and Savoyards might have been supposed pretty well satiated with the dignities and riches which they had acquired a new set of hungry foreigners were invited over and shared among them those favours which the King ought in policy to have conferred on the English nobility by whom his government could have been supported and defended His mother Isabella who had been unjustly taken by the late King from the count de la Marche to whom she was betrothed was no sooner mistress of herself by the death of her husband than she married that nobleman  Trevet p    and she had born him four sons Guy William Geoffrey and Aymer whom she sent over into England to pay a visit to their brother The goodnatured and affectionate disposition of Henry was moved at  the sight of such near relations and he considered neither his own circumstances nor the humours of his people in the honours and riches which he conferred upon them  M Paris p M West p Knyghton p  Complaints rose as loud against the credit of the Gascon as ever they had done against that of the Poictevin and Savoyard favourites and to a nation prejudiced against them all their measures appeared criminal and exceptionable Violations of the great charter were frequently mentioned and it is indeed more than likely that foreigners ignorant of the laws and relying on the boundless affections of a weak prince would in an age when a regular administration was not any where known pay more attention to their own present interest than to the liberties of the people It is reported that the Poictevins and other strangers when the laws were at any time appealed to in opposition to their oppressions scrupled not to reply  What did the English laws signify to them They minded them not  And as words are often more offensive than actions this open contempt of the English tended much to aggravate the general discontent and made every act of violence committed by the foreigners appear not only an injury but an affront to them  M Paris p Ann Waver p Chron Dunst vol p    I reckon not among the violations of the great charter some arbitrary exertions of prerogative which Henry's necessities obliged him to practise and which without producing any discontent were uniformly continued by all his successors till the last century As the parliament often refused him supplies and that in a manner somewhat rude and indecent  M Paris p  he obliged his opulent subjects particularly the citizens of London to grant him loans of money and it is natural to imagine that the same want of oeconomy which reduced him to the necessity of borrowing would prevent him from being very punctual in the payment  M Paris p  He demanded benevolences or pretended voluntary contributions from his nobility and prelates  M Paris p  He was the first King of England since the conquest who could fairly be said to lye under the restraint of law and he was also the first who practised the dispensing power and employed the famous clause of  Nonobstance  in his grants and patents When objections were made to this novelty he replied that the Pope exercised that authority and why might he not imitate the example But the abuse which the Pope made of his dispensing power in violating the Canons of general councils in invading the privileges and customs of all particular churches and in usurping on the rights of patrons was more likely to excite the jealousy of the people than to reconcile them to a similar practice in their civil government Roger de Thurkesby one of the King's justices  was so displeased with the precedent that he exclaimed  Alas what times are we fallen into Behold the civil court is corrupted in imitation of the ecclesiastical and the river is poisoned from that fountain  THE King's partiality and profuse bounty to his foreign relations and to their friends and favourites would have appeared more tolerable to the English had any thing been done meanwhile for the honour of the nation or had Henry's enterprizes in foreign countries been attended with any success or glory to himself or to the public At least such military talents in the King would have served to keep his barons in awe and have given weight and authority to his government But tho' he declared war against Lewis IX in and made an expedition into Guienne upon the invitation of his father in law the count de la Marche who promised to join him with all his forces he was unsuccessful in his attempts against that great monarch was worsted at Taillebourg was deserted by his allies lost what remained to him of Poictou and was obliged to return with some loss of honour into England  M Paris p W Heming p Chron Dunst vol p  The Gascon nobility were attached to the English government because the distance of their sovereign allowed them to remain in a state of almost total independance  And they claimed some time after the King's protection against an invasion which the King of Castile made upon that territory Henry returned into Guienne and was more successful in this expedition but he thereby involved himself and his nobility in an enormous debt which both encreased their discontents and exposed him to greater danger from their enterprizes  M Paris p    WANT of oeconomy and an ill judged liberality were Henry's great defects and his debts even before this expedition had become so troublesome to him that he sold all his plate and jewels in order to discharge them When this expedient was first proposed he asked where he would find purchasers It was replied the citizens of London  On my word  said he  if the treasury of Augustus were brought to market the citizens are able to be the purchasers These clowns who assume to themselves the name of barons abound in every thing while we are reduced to necessities  M Paris p  And he was thenceforth observed to be more forward and greedy in his exactions upon the citizens  M Paris p    Ecclesiastical grievances  BUT the grievances which the English had reason to complain of in the civil government during this reign seem to have been still less grievous than those which they underwent from the usurpations and exactions of the court of Rome On the death of Langton in the monks of Christchurch elected Walter de  Hemesham one of their own body for his successor But as Henry refused to confirm the election the Pope at his desire annulled it  M Paris p  and immediately appointed Richard chancellor of Lincoln for archbishop without waiting for a new election On the death of Richard in the monks elected Ralph de Neville bishop of Chichester and tho' Henry was much pleased with the election the Pope who thought that prelate too much attached to the crown assumed the power of annulling his election  M Paris p  He rejected two clergymen more whom the Monks had successively chosen and he at last told them that if they would elect Edmond treasurer of the church of Salisbury he would confirm their choice and his nomination was complied with The Pope had the prudence to appoint both times very worthy primates but men could not forbear observing his intention of thus drawing gradually to himself the right of bestowing that important dignity  THE avarice however more than ambition of the see of Rome seems to have been in this age the ground of general complaint and the papal ministers finding a vast stock of power amassed by their predecessors were desirous of turning it to present profit which they enjoyed at home rather than of enlarging their authority in distant countries where they never intended to reside Every thing was become venal in the Romish tribunals simony was openly practised no favours and even no justice could be obtained without a bribe the highest bidder was sure to have the preference without regard either to the merits of the person or of the cause and besides the usual perversions of right in the decision of controversies the Pope openly assumed an absolute and uncontroled authority of setting aside by the plenitude of his apostolic power all particular rules and privileges of patrons churches and convents  M Paris p Ann Burt p M West p  Under pretence of remedying these abuses Pope Honorius in complaining of the poverty of his see as the source of all grievances demanded from every cathedral two of the best prebends and from every convent two monks portions to be set apart as a perpetual and settled revenue of the papal crown but all men being sensible that the revenue would continue for ever and the abuses immediately return his demand was unanimously rejected  M Paris p Chron Dunst vol p M West p  About three years after the Pope demanded and obtained the tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues which he levied in a very oppressive manner requiring payment before the clergy had drawn their rents or tythes and sending about usurers who advanced them the money at exorbitant interest  M Paris p  In the year Otho the legate having in vain attempted the  clergy in a body obtained separately by intrigues and menaces large sums from the prelates and convents and on his departure is said to have carried more money out of the kingdom than he left in it  M Paris p  This experiment was renewed four years after with equal success by Martin the Nuncio who brought from Rome powers of suspending and excommunicating all clergymen that refused to comply with his demands  M Paris p  The King who relied on the Pope for the support of his tottering authority never failed to countenance these exactions  M Paris p    MEAN while all the chief benefices of the kingdom were conferred on Italians great numbers of that nation were sent over at one time to be provided for nonresidence and pluralities were carried to an enormous height Mansel the King's chaplain is computed to have held at once seven hundred ecclesiastical livings  M Paris p M West p  and the abuses became too great and palpable even for the blindness and patience of superstition any longer to endure them The populace entering into associations rose in tumults against the Italian clergy pillaged their barns wasted their fields insulted the persons of such of them as they found in the kingdom  Rymer vol p M Paris p Ann Burt p Chron Dunst vol p  and when the justiciaries made enquiry into the authors of this disorder the guilt was found to involve so many and those of such high rank that it passed unpunished At last when Innocent IV in called a general council at Lyons in order to excommunicate the emperor Frederic the King and nobility sent over agents to complain before the council of the avarice of the Romish church and they represented among many other grievances that the benefices of the Italian clergy in England had been estimated and were found to amount to marks  Innocent's bull in Rymer vol p says only marks a year  a year a sum which exceeded the annual revenue of the crown itself  M Paris p The customs were part of Henry's revenue and amounted to pounds a year They were at first small sums paid by the merchants for the use of the King's warehouses measures weights c See Gilbert's history of the exch p  They obtained only an evasive answer from the Pope but as mention had been made before the council of the feudal subjection of England to the see of Rome the English agents at whose head was Roger Bigod earl of Norfolk exclaimed against that pretension and insisted that King John had no right without the consent of his barons to subject the kingdom to so ignominious a servitude  M Paris p  The Popes indeed afraid of carrying matters too far against England seem thenceforth to have little insisted on that exorbitant pretension  THIS check received at the council of Lyons was not able to stop the court of Rome in its career Innocent exacted the revenues of all vacant benefices the twentieth of all ecclesiastical revenues without exception the third of such as exceeded a hundred marks a year the half of such as were possessed by nonresidents  M Paris p Ann Burt p  He claimed the goods of all intestate clergymen  M Paris p  he pretended a title to inherit all money got by usury he levied voluntary contributions from the people and when the King contrary to his usual practice prohibited these exactions he threatened to denounce against him the same censures which he had launched against the emperor Frederic  M Paris p    BUT the most oppressive expedient employed by the Pope was the embarking Henry in an enterprize for the conquest of Naples or Sicily on this side the Fare as it was called an affair which threw much dishonour on the King and involved him during some years in great expence and trouble The Romish church taking advantage of favourable incidents had reduced the kingdom of Sicily to the same state of feudal vassalage which she pretended to extend over England and which by reason of the distance as well as high spirit of this latter kingdom she was not able to maintain After the death of the emperor Frederic II the succession of Sicily devolved to Conradine grandson to that monarch and Mainfroy his natural son under pretence of governing the kingdom during the infancy of the prince had formed a scheme of establishing his own authority Pope Innocent IV who had carried on violent war against the emperor Frederic and endeavoured to dispossess him of his Italian dominions still continued hostilities against his grandson but being disappointed in all his schemes by the activity and artifices of Mainfroy he found that his own force alone was not sufficient to bring to a happy issue so great an enterprize He pretended to dispose of the Sicilian crown both as superior lord of that particular kingdom and as vicar of Christ to whom all kingdoms of the earth were subjected and he made a tender of it to Richard earl of Cornwal whose immense riches he flattered himself would be able to support the military operations against Mainfroy As Richard had the prudence to refuse the present  M Paris p  he applied to the King whose levity and thoughtless disposition gave him more hopes of success and he offered him the crown of Sicily for his second son Edmond  Rymer p M Paris p  Henry allured by so magnificent a gift without reflecting on the consequences without consulting either with his brother or the parliament accepted of this insidious proposal and gave the Pope unlimited credit to expend whatever  sums he thought necessary for compleating the conquest of Sicily Innocent who was engaged by his own interests to make war with Mainfroy was glad to carry on his enterprizes at the expence of his ally Alexander IV who succeeded him in the papal throne continued the same policy And Henry was surprized to find himself on a sudden involved in an immense debt which he had never been consulted in contracting The sum already amounted to marks beside interest  Rymer vol p Chron Dunst vol p  and he had the prospect if he answered this demand of being soon loaded with more exorbitant expences if he refused it of both incurring the Pope's displeasure and of losing the crown of Sicily which he hoped soon to have the glory of fixing on the head of his son  HE applied to the parliament for supply and that he might be secure of not meeting with opposition he sent no writs to the more refractory barons But even those who were summoned sensible of the ridiculous cheat imposed by the Pope determined not to lavish their money on such chimerical projects and making a pretext of the absence of their brethren they refused to take the King's demands into consideration  M Paris p  In this extremity the clergy were his only resource and as both their temporal and spiritual sovereign concurred in loading them they were ill able to defend themselves against this united authority  THE Pope published a croisade for the conquest of Sicily and required every one who had taken the cross against the infidels or had vowed to advance money for their enterprize to turn the war against Mainfroy a more terrible enemy to the christian faith than any Saracen  Rymer vol p c  He levied a tenth on all ecclesiastical benefices in England for three years and gave orders to excommunicate all bishops who made not punctual payment He granted to the King the goods of intestate clergymen the revenues of vacant benefices the revenues of all nonresidents  Rymer vol p  But these taxations being levied by some rule were deemed less grievous than another arbitrary imposition which arose from the suggestion of the bishop of Hereford and which might have opened the door to endless and intolerable abuses  THAT prelate who resided at the court of Rome by a deputation from the English church drew bills of different values but amounting on the whole to marks on all the bishops and abbots of the kingdom and granted these bills to Italian merchants who it was pretended had advanced money for the service of the war against Mainfroy  M Paris p Chron T Wykes p  As there was no likelihood of the English prelates submitting without compulsion to such an extraordinary demand Rustand  the legate was charged with the office of employing his authority to that purpose and he summoned an assembly of the bishops and abbots whom he acquainted with the Pope's and the King's pleasure Great were the surprize and indignation of the assembly at the imposition The bishop of Worcester exclaimed that he would lose his life rather than comply The bishop of London said that the Pope and King were more powerful than he but if his mitre were taken off his head he would clap on a helmet in its place  M Paris p  The legate was no less violent on the other hand and he told the assembly in plain terms that all ecclesiastical benefices were the property of the Pope and he might dispose of them either in whole or in part as he saw proper  M Paris p  In the end the bishops and abbots being threatened with excommunication which made all their revenues fall into the King's hands were obliged to submit to the exaction And the only mitigation which the legate allowed them was that the tenths already granted should be accepted as a partial payment of the bills But the money was still insufficient for the Pope's purpose The conquest of Sicily was as remote as ever The demands which came from Rome were endless Pope Alexander became so urgent a creditor that he sent over a legate into England threatening the kingdom with an interdict and the King with excommunication if the arrears which he pretended to be due to him were not instantly remitted  Rymer vol p M Paris p  And at last Henry sensible of the cheat began to think of breaking off the agreement and of resigning into the Pope's hands that crown which it was not intended by Alexander that he or his family should ever enjoy  Rymer vol p    Earl of Cornwal elected King of the Romans  THE earl of Cornwal had now reason to value himself on his foresight in refusing the fraudulent bargain with Rome and in preferring the solid honours of an opulent and powerful prince of the blood in England before the empty and precarious glory of a foreign dignity But he had not always firmness sufficient to adhere to this resolution His vanity and ambition prevailed at last over his prudence and his avarice and he was engaged in an enterprize equally expensive and vexatious as that of his brother and not attended with much greater probability of success The immense opulence of Richard having made the German princes cast their eye on him as a candidate for the empire he was tempted to expend vast sums of money on his election and he succeeded so far as to be chosen King of the Romans which seemed to render his succession infallible to the imperial throne He went over into Germany and carried out of the kingdom no less a sum than seven hundred thousand marks if we may believe the  account of some antient authors  M Paris p The same author a few pages before makes Richard's treasures amount to little more than half the sum p The King's dissipations and expences throughout his whole reign according to the same author had amounted only to about marks p  which is probably much exaggerated  The sums mentioned by antient authors who were all monks are often improbable and never consistent But we know from an infallible authority the public remonstrance to the council of Lions that the King's revenues were below marks a year His brother therefore could never have been master of marks especially as he did not sell his estates in England as we learn from the same author And we hear afterwards of his ordering all his woods to be cut down in order to satisfy the rapacity of the German princes His son succeeded to the earldom of Cornwal and his other revenues  His money while it lasted procured him friends and partizans But it was soon drained from him by the rapacity of the German princes and having no personal or family connexions in that country no solid foundation of power he found at last that he had lavished away the frugality of a whole life in order to procure a splendid title and that his absence from England joined to the weakness of his brother's government gave reins to the factious and turbulent dispositions of the English barons and involved his own country and family in infinite calamities  Discontents of the barons  THE successful revolt of the nobility from King John and their imposing on him and his successors limitations of the royal power had made them feel their own weight and importance had set a dangerous precedent of resistance and being followed by a long minority had impoverished as well as weakened that crown which they were at last induced from the fear of worse consequences to replace on the head of young Henry In the King's situation either great abilities and vigour were requisite to overawe the barons or great caution and reserve to give them no pretence for complaints and it must be confessed that this prince was possessed of neither of these talents He had not prudence to choose right measures he wanted even that constancy which sometimes gives weight to wrong ones he was entirely abandoned to his favourites who were always foreigners he lavished on them without discretion his diminished revenue and finding that his barons indulged their disposition towards tyranny and observed not to their own vassals the same rules which they had imposed on the crown he was apt in his administration to neglect all the salutary articles of the great charter which he remarked to be so little regarded by his nobility This conduct had extremely lessened his authority in the kingdom had multiplied complaints against him and had frequently exposed him to affronts and even to dangerous attempts upon his prerogative In the year when he desired a supply from parliament the barons complaining of the frequent breaches of the  great charter and of the many fruitless applications which they had formerly made for the redress of this and other grievances demanded in return that he should give them the nomination of the great justiciary and of the chancellor to whose hands chiefly the administration of justice was committed and if we may credit the historian  Math Paris p    they had formed the plan of other limitations as well as of associations to maintain them which would have reduced the King to be an absolute cypher and have held the crown in perpetual pupillage and dependance The King to satisfy them would agree to nothing but a renewal of the charter and a general permission to excommunicate all the violators of it And he received no other supply except their consent to levy a scutage of twenty shillings on each knight's fee for the marriage of his eldest daughter to the King of Scotland a burthen which was expressly annexed to their feudal tenures  FOUR years after in a very full parliament when Henry demanded a new supply he was openly reproached with the breach of his word and the frequent violations of the charter He was asked whether he did not blush to desire any aid from his people whom he professedly hated and despised to whom on all occasions he preferred aliens and foreigners and who groaned under the oppressions which he either permitted or exercised over them He was told that besides disparaging his nobility by forcing them to contract unequal and mean marriages with strangers no rank of men were so low as to escape vexations from him or his ministers that even the victuals consumed in his houshold the cloaths which himself and his servants wore especially the wine which they used were all taken by violence from the lawful owners and no compensation was ever made them for the injury that foreign merchants to the great prejudice and infamy of the kingdom shunned the English harbours as if they were possessed by pyrates and the commerce with all nations was thus cut off by these violences that loss was added to loss and injury to injury while the merchants who had been despoiled of their goods were also obliged to carry them at their own charges to whatever place the King was pleased to appoint them that even the poor fishermen on the coast could not escape his oppressions and those of his courtiers and finding that they had not the full liberty of disposing of their commodities in the Eng ish market were frequently constrained to carry them to foreign ports and to hazard all the perils of the ocean rather than those which awaited them from his oppressive emissaries and that his very religion was a ground of complaint to his subjects while they observed that the waxen tapers and splendid silks employed in so many useless processions were the spoils which he had forcibly  ravished from the true possessors  M Paris p See farther p M West p  Throughout this remonstrance in which the complaints derived from an abuse of the antient right of purveyance may be supposed to be somewhat exaggerated there appears a strange mixture of regal tyranny in the practices which gave rise to it and of aristocratical liberty or rather licentiousness in the expressions employed by the parliament But a mixture of this kind is observable in all the antient feudal governments and both of them proved equally hurtful to the people  As the King in answer to their remonstrance gave the parliament only good words and fair promises attended with the most humble submissions which they had often found deceitful he obtained at that time no supply and therefore in the year when he found himself again under the necessity of applying to parliament he had provided himself of a new pretence which he deemed infallible and taking the vow of a Croisade to the holy land he demanded their assistance in that pious enterprize  M Paris p Chron Dunst vol p  The parliament however for some time scrupled compliance and the ecclesiastical order sent a deputation of four prelates the primate the bishops of Winchester Salisbury and Carlisle in order to remonstrate with him on his frequent violations of their privileges the oppressions with which he loaded them and all his subjects  M Paris p  and the uncanonical and forced elections which were made to vacant dignities  "It is true"  replied the King  "I have been somewhat faulty in this particular I obtruded you my lord of Canterbury upon your see I was obliged to employ both entreaties and menaces my lord of Winchester to have you elected my proceedings were very irregular my lords of Salisbury and Carlisle when I raised you from the lowest stations to your present dignities I am determined henceforth to correct these errors and it will also become you in order to make a thorough reformation to resign your present benefices and try to enter again in a more regular and canonical manner  M Paris p  "  The bishops surprized at these unexpected sarcasms replied that the question was not at present how to correct past errors but to avoid them for the future The King promised redress both of ecclesiastical and civil grievances and the parliament in return agreed to grant him a supply a tenth of the ecclesiastical benefices and a scutage of three marks on each knight's fee But as they had experienced his frequent breach of promise they required that he should ratify the great charter in a manner still more authentic and solemn than any which he had ever hitherto employed All the prelates and abbots were assembled They held burning tapers in their hands The great charter was read before them They denounced the sentence of excommunication against every  one who should thenceforth violate that fundamental law They threw their tapers on the ground and exclaimed  May the soul of every one who incurs this sentence so stink and corrupt in Hell  The King bore a part in this ceremony and subjoined  "So help me God I will keep all these things inviolate as I am a man as I am a christian as I am a knight and as I am a King crowned and anointed"  M Paris p Ann Burt p Ann Waverl p W Heming p M West p    Yet was the tremenduous ceremony no sooner finished than his favourites abusing his weakness and facility made him return to the same arbitrary and irregular administration and the reasonable expectations of his people were thus continually eluded and disappointed  M Paris p    Simond de Mountfort ea  l  f Leicester  ALL these imprudent and illegal measures afforded a pretence to Simon de Mountfort earl of Leicester to attempt an innovation in the government and to wrest the scepter from the feeble and irresolute hand which held it This nobleman was a younger son of that Simon de Mountfort who had conducted with such valour and renown the Croisade against the Albigenses and who tho' he tarnished his famous exploits by cruelty and ambition had left a name very precious to all the bigots of that age particularly to the ecclesiastics A large inheritance in England fell by succession to this family but as the elder br ther enjoyed still more opulent possessions in France and could not perform fealty to two masters he transferred his right to Simon his younger brother who came over into England did homage for his lands and was raised to the dignity of earl of Leicester In the year he espoused Eleanor dowager of Wil iam earl of Pembroke and sister to the King  M Paris p  but the marriage of this princess with a subject and a foreigner tho' finished with Henry's consent was loudly complained of by the earl of Cornwal and all the barons of England and Leicester was supported against their violence entirely by the King's favour and authority  M Paris p  But he had no sooner established himself in his possessions and dignities than he acquired by insinuation and address a strong interest with the nation and gained equally the affections of all orders of men He lost however the friendship of Henry from the usual levity and fickleness of that prince he was banished the court he was recalled he was entrusted with the command of Guienne  Rymer vol p    where he did good service and acquired honour he was again disgraced by the King and his banishment from court seemed now final and irrevocable Henry called him a traitor to his face Leicester gave him the lye and told him that if he were not his sovereign he would soon make him repent  of that insult  Yet was this quarrel accommodated either from the good nature or timidity of the King and Leicester was again admitted into some degree of favour and authority But as this nobleman was become too great to preserve an entire complaisance to Henry's humours and to act in subserviency to his other minions he found more advantage in cultivating his interest with the public and in inflaming the general discontents which prevailed against the administration He filled every place with complaints against the infringement of the great charter the violences committed on the people the combination between the Pope and the King in their tyranny and extortions Henry's neglect of his native subjects and barons and tho' himself a foreigner he was more loud than any in representing the indignity of submitting to the dominion of foreigners By his hypocritical pretensions to devotion he gained the favour of the zealots and clergy By his seeming concern for public good he acquired the affections of the public And besides the private friendships which he had cultivated with the barons his animosity against the favourites bred an union of interests between him and that powerful order  A recent quarrel which broke out between Leicester and William de Valence Henry's half brother a chief favourite brought matters to extremity  M Paris p  and determined the former to give full scope to his bold and unbounded ambition which the laws and the King's authority had hitherto with difficulty restrained He secretly called a meeting of the most considerable barons particularly Humphrey de Bohun high constable Roger Bigod earl Mareschal and the earls of Warwick and Glocester men who by their family and possessions stood in the first rank of the English nobility He represented to this company the necessity of reforming the state and of putting the execution of the laws into other hands than those which had hitherto appeared from repeated experience so unfit for the charge with which they were entrusted He exaggerated the oppressions of the lower orders of the state the violations of the barons' privileges the continued plunder of the clergy and in order to aggravate the enormity of this conduct he appealed to the great charter which Henry had so often ratified and which was calculated to prevent for ever the return of these intolerable grievances He magnified the generosity of their ancestors who at an infinite expence of blood had extorted that famous concession from the crown but lamented their own degeneracy who allowed so great an advantage once obtained to be wrested from them by a weak prince and by insolent strangers And he insisted that the King's word after so many submissions and fruitless promises on his part could no longer be relied on and that nothing but his absolute inability  to violate national privileges could henceforth ensure the regular observance of them  THESE topics which were founded in truth and suited so well the sentiments of the company had the desired effect and the barons entered into a resolution of redressing the public grievances by taking into their own hands the administration of the government The King having summoned a parliament in expectation of receiving supplies for his Sicilian project the barons appeared in the hall clad in complete armour and with their swords by their side and the King on his entry struck with this unusual appearance asked them what was their meaning and whether they pretended to make him their prisoner  Annal Theokesbury  Roger Bigod replied in the name of the rest that he was not their prisoner but their sovereign that they even intended to grant him large supplies in order to fix his son on the throne of Sicily that they only expected some return for this expence and service and that as he had frequently made submissions to the parliament had acknowledged his past errors and had still allowed himself to be carried into the same path which gave them such just reason of complaint he must now yield to more strict regulations and confer authority on those who were able and willing to redress the public grievances Henry partly allured by the hopes of supply partly intimidated by the union and martial appearance of the barons agreed to their demand and promised to summon another parliament at Oxford in order to digest the new plan of government and to elect the persons who were to be entrusted with the chief authority  June Prov  ns of O  ford  THIS parliament which the royalists and even the nation from experience of the confusions that attended its measures afterwards denominated the  mad parliament  met on the day appointed and as all the barons brought along with them their military vassals and appeared with an armed force the King who had taken no precautions against them was in reality a prisoner in their hands and was obliged to submit to all the terms which they were pleased to impose upon him Twelve barons were selected from the King's council twelve more were chosen by parliament To these twentyfour unlimited authority was granted of reforming the state and the King himself took an oath that he would maintain whatever ordinances they should think proper to enact for that purpose  Rymer vol p Chron Dunst vol p Knyghton    Leicester was at the head of this supreme council to which the legislative power was thus in reality transferred and all their measures were taken by his secret influence and direction Their first step bore a specious appearance and seemed well calculated for the end which they professed to be the object of  all these innovations They ordered that four knights should be chosen by each county that they should make enquiry into the grievances of which their neighbourhood had reason to complain and should attend the next ensuing parliament in order to give information to that assembly of the state of their particular counties  M Paris p Addit p Ann Burt p  A nearer approach to our present constitution than had been made by the barons in the reign of King John when the knights were only appointed to meet in their counties and there to draw up a detail of their grievances Mean while the twentyfour barons proceeded to enact some regulations in order to provide a redress for such grievances as were supposed to be notorious to all the world They ordered that three sessions of parliament should be regularly held every year in the months of February June and October that a new high sheriff should be elected every year by the votes of the freeholders in each county  Chron Dunst vol p  that the sheriffs should have no power of fining the barons who did not attend at their courts or the circuits of the justiciaries that no heirs should be committed to the wardship of foreigners and no castles be entrusted to their custody and that no new warrens or forests should be created nor the revenues of any counties or hundreds be let to farm Such were the regulations which the twentyfour barons enacted at Oxford for the redress of public grievances  Ann Burt p    BUT the earl of Leicester and his associates having advanced so far to satisfy the nation instead of continuing in this popular course or granting the King that supply which they had promised him immediately made provisions for the extension and continuance of their own unlimited authority They rouzed anew the popular clamour which had long prevailed against foreigners and they fell with the utmost violence on the King's half brothers who were supposed to be the authors of all national grievances and whom Henry had no longer any power to protect The four brothers sensible of their danger took to flight with an intention of making their escape out of the kingdom they were eagerly pursued by the barons Aymer one of the brothers who had been elected to the see of Winchester took shelter in his episcopal palace and carried the others along with him they were surrounded in that place and threatened to be dragged out by force and to be punished for their crimes and misdemeanors and the King pleading the sacredness of an ecclesiastical sanctuary was glad to extricate them from this danger by banishing them the kingdom  M Paris p Ann Burt p Chron T Wykes p W Heming p Chron Dunst p M West p Ypod Neust p Knyghton p  In this act of violence as well as in the former usurpations of the barons the queen and her uncles were thought to have  secretly concurred being jealous of the credit acquired by the brothers which they imagined had eclipsed and annihilated their own  Ann Waverl p    Usurpations of the barons  BUT the subsequent proceedings of the twenty four barons were sufficient to open the eyes of the whole kingdom and to prove their intention of reducing for ever both the King and the people under the arbitrary power of a very narrow aristocracy which must at last have terminated either in anarchy or in a violent usurpation and tyranny They pretended that they had not as yet digested all the regulations necessary for the reformation of the state and for the redress of grievances and that they must still retain their power till that great purpose was thoroughly effectuated In other words that they must be perpetual governors and must continue to reform till they were pleased to demit their authority They formed an association among themselves and swore that they would stand by each other with their lives and fortunes They displaced all the chief officers of the crown the high justiciary the chancellor the treasurer and advanced either themselves or their own creatures in their stead Even the offices of the King's houshold were disposed of at their pleasure The government of all the castles was put into hands in whom they found reason to confide And the whole power of the state being thus transferred to them they ventured to impose an oath on every individual of the nation in which the subjects were obliged to swear under the penalty of being declared public enemies that they would obey and execute all the regulations both known and unknown of the twentyfour barons And all this for the greater glory of God the honour of the church the service of the King and the advantage of the kingdom  Chron T Wykes p  No one dared to withstand this tyrannical authority Prince Edward himself the King's eldest son a youth of eighteen years of age who began to give indications of that great and manly spirit which appeared throughout the whole course of his life was after making some opposition constrained to take that oath which really deposed him and his family from sovereign authority  Ann Burt p  Earl Warrenne was the last person in the kingdom who could be brought to give the confederated barons this mark of submission  BUT the twenty four barons not content with the usurpation of the royal power introduced an innovation in the constitution of parliament which was of the utmost importance They ordained that that assembly should choose a committee of twelve persons who should in the intervals of the sessions possess the authority of the whole parliament and should attend on a summons the person of the King in all his motions But so powerful were these barons that this regulation was also submitted to the whole government was overthrown  or fixed on new foundations and the monarchy was totally subverted without its being possible for the King to strike a single stroke in defence of the constitution against the newly erected aristocracy  THE report that the King of the Romans intended to pay a visit to England gave alarm to the ruling barons and they dreaded lest the extensive influence and established authority of that prince would be employed to restore the prerogatives of his family and overturn their new plan of government  M Paris p  They sent over the new bishop of Worcester who met him at St Omars asked him in the name of the barons the reason of his journey and how long he intended to stay in England and insisted that before he entered the kingdom he should swear t observe the regulations established at Oxford On Richard's refusal to take this oath they prepared to resist him as a public enemy they fitted out a fleet assembled an army and exciting the inveterate prejudices of the people against foreigners from whom they had suffered so many oppressions spread the report that Richard intended to restore by force the authority of his exiled brothers and to violate all the securities provided for public liberty The King of the Romans was at last ob iged to submit to the terms required of him  M Paris p Chron T Wykes p    BUT the barons in proportion to their continuance in power began gradually to lose that popularity whi  h had assisted them in obtaining it and men repined that reg  lations which were only established during a ti  e for the reformation of the state were likely to become perpetual and to subvert entirely the antient constitution They dreaded that the power of the nobles which was always oppressive would now exert itself without controul by removing the counterpoise of the crown and their apprehensions were encreased by some new edicts of the barons which were plain y calculated to procure to themselves an impunity in all their violences They appointed that the circuits of the itinerant justices the sole check on their arbitrary conduct should be held only once in seven years and men easily saw that a remedy which returned after such long intervals against an oppressive power which was perpetual would prove totally insignificant and useless  M Paris p Trivet p  The cry became loud in the nation that the barons should finish their intended regulations The knights of the shires who seem now to have been pretty regularly assembled in a separate house made remonstrances against the slowness of their proceedings they represented that though the King had performed all the conditions required of him the barons had hitherto done nothing for the public good and had been only careful to promote their own private advantage and to commit injury on the crown and they even appealed  to prince Edward and claimed his interposal for the interests of the nation and the reformation of the government  Annal Burt p  The prince replied that though it was from constraint and contrary to his private sentiments he had sworn to adhere to the provisions of Oxford he was determined to observe his oath But he sent a message to the barons requiring them to bring their undertaking to a speedy conclusion and fulfil their engagements to the public Otherwise he menaced them that at the expence of his life he would oblige them to do their duty and would shed the last drop of his blood in promoting the interests and satisfying the just wishes of the nation  Annal Burt p    THE barons urged by so pressing a necessity published at last a new code of ordinances for the reformation of the state  Annal Burt p  But the expectations of the people were extremely disappointed when they found that these consisted only of some trivial alterations on the municipal law and still more so when the barons pretended that the task was not yet finished and that they must farther prolong their authority in order to bring the work of reformation to the desired period The current of popularity was now much turned to the side of the crown and the barons had little more to rely on for their support besides the private influence and power of their families which though exorbitant was likely to prove inferior to the combination of King and people Even this basis of power was daily weakened by their intestine jealousies and animosities their antient and inveterate quarrels broke out when they came to divide the spoils of the crown and the rivalship between the earls of Leicester and Glocester the chief leaders among them began to disjoint the whole confederacy The latter more moderate in his pretensions was desirous of stopping or retarding the career of the barons' usurpations but the former enraged at the opposition which he met with in his own party pretended to throw up all concern in English affairs and he retired into France  Chron Dunst vol p    THE kingdom of France the only state with which England had any considerable intercourse was at this time governed by Lewis IX a prince of the most singular character which is to be met with in all the records of history This monarch united to the mean and abject superstition of a monk all the courage and magnanimity of the greatest hero and what may be deemed more extraordinary the justice and integrity of the most disinterested patriot to the mildness and humanity of the most accomplished philosopher So far from taking advantage of the divisions of the English or attempting to expel those dangerous rivals from the provinces which they still possessed in France he had entertained many scruples with  regard to the forfeiture pronounced against the King's father had even expressed some intention of restoring the other provinces and he was only prevented from taking that imprudent resolution by the united remonstrances of his own barons who represented the extreme danger of such a measure  M Paris p    and what had a greater influence on Lewis the justice of punishing by a legal sentence the barbarity and felony of John Wherever this prince interposed in English affairs it was always with an intention of composing the differences between the King and his nobility he recommended to both parties every peaceable and reconciling measure and he used all his authority with the earl of Leicester his native subject to bend him to a compliance with Henry  Ma    He made a treaty with England at a time when the distractions of that kingdom were at the greatest height and when the King's authority was totally annihilated and the terms which he granted might even in a more prosperous state of their affairs be deemed reasonable and advantageous by the English He yielded up some territories which had been conquered from Poictou and Guienne he ensured the peaceable possession of the latter province to Henry he agreed to pay that prince a large sum of money and he only required that the King should in return make a final cession to France of Normandy and the other provinces which he could never entertain any hopes of recovering by force of arms  Rymer vol p  M Paris p  Chron T Wykes p Trevit p  M West p  This cession was ratified by Henry by his two sons and two daughters and by the King of the Romans and his three sons Leicester alone either moved by a vain arrogance or desirous to ingratiate himself with the English populace protested against the deed and insisted on the right however distant which might accrue to his countess  Chron T Wykes    Lewis saw in this obstinacy the unbounded ambition of the man and as the barons insisted that the money which was due by treaty should be at their disposal not at Henry's he also saw and probably with regret the low condition to which this monarch who had more erred from weakness than malice was reduced by the turbulency of his own subjects  BUT the situation of Henry changed soon after much to his advantage The twenty four barons had now enjoyed the sovereign power for near three years and had visibly employed it not for the reformation of the state which was their first pretence but for the aggrandizement of themselves and of their families The breach of trust was apparent to all the world Every order of men felt and murmured against it The dissentions among the barons themselves which encreased the evil made also the remedy more obvious and easy And the secret  desertion in particular of the earl of Glocester to the crown seemed to promise Henry certain success in any attempt to resume his authority Yet dated he not to take that step so reconcilable both to justice and policy without making a previous application to Rome and obtaining an absolution from his oaths and engagements  THE Pope was at that time very much dissatisfied with the conduct of the barons who in order to gain the favour of the people and clergy of England had expelled all the Italian ecclesiastics had confiscated their benefices and seemed determined to maintain the liberties and privileges of the English church in which the rights of patronage belonging to their own families were also included The extreme animosity of the English clergy against the Italians was also a source of his disgust to this order and an attempt which had been made by them for farther liberty and independence on the civil power was therefore less acceptable to the court of Rome About the same time that the barons at Oxford had annihilated the prerogatives of the monarchy the clergy met in a synod at Merton and passed several decrees which were no less calculated to promote their own grandeur at the expence of the crown They decreed that it was unlawful to try the ecclesiastics by secular judges that the clergy were not to regard any prohib tions from civil courts that lay patrons had no right to confer spiritual benefices that the magistrate was obliged without farther enquiry to imprison all excommunicated persons and that antient usage without any particular grant or charter was a sufficient authority for any clerical possessions or privileges  Ann Burt p    About a century ago these claims would have been sanctified by the court of Rome beyond the most fundamental articles of faith They were the chief points maintained by the great martyr Becket and his resolution in defending them had exalted him to the high station which he held in the catalogue of Romish faints But principles were changed with the times The Pope was become somewhat jealous of t e great independance of the English church which made them stand less in need of his protection and even emboldened them to resist his authority and complain of the preference given to the Italian courtiers whose interests it is natutural to imagine were the chief object of his concern He was very ready therefore on the King's application to annul these new constitutions of the church of England  Rymer vol p  And at the same time he absolved the King and all his subjects from the each which they had taken to observe the provisions of Oxford  Rymer vol p M Paris p W Heming p Ypod Neust p Knyghton p    Prince Edward  Prince Edward whose enlarged thoughts though in such early youth had taught him the great prejudice which his father had incurred by his levity inconstancy  and frequent breach of promise refused for a long time to take advantage of this absolution and declared that the provisions of Oxford however unreasonable in themselves and however much abused by the barons ought still to be adhered to by those who had sworn to observe them  M Paris p  He himself had been constrained by violence to take that oath yet was he determined to keep it By this scrupulous fidelity the prince acquired the confidence of all parties and was afterwards enabled to recover fully the royal authority and to perform such great actions both during his own reign and that of his father  THE situation of England during this period as well as that of most European kingdoms was somewhat peculiar There was no regular military force maintained in the nation The sword however was not properly speaking in the hands of the people The barons were entrusted entirely with the defence of the community and after any effort which they made either against their own prince or against foreigners as the military retainers departed to their own home the armies were dissolved and could not speedily be reassembled at pleasure It was easy therefore for a few barons by a combination to get the start of the other party to collect suddenly their troops and to appear unexpectedly in the field with an army which their antagonists though equal or even superior in power and interest would not dare to encounter Hence the sudden revolutions which were observable in these governments Hence the frequent victories obtained without a blow by one faction over another And hence it happened that the seeming prevalence of a party was seldom a prognostic of its long continuance in power and authority  THE King so soon as he received the Pope's absolution from his oath which was accompanied with menaces of excommunication against all opposers trusting to the countenance of the church to the support promised him by many considerable barons and to the returning favour of the people immediately took off the mask and after justifying his conduct by a proclamation in which he set forth the private ambition and the breach of trust conspicuous in Leicester and his associates declared that he had resumed the government and was determined thenceforth to exert the royal authority for the protection of his subjects He removed Hugh le d'Espenser and Nicholas de Ely the high justiciary and chancellor appointed by the barons and put Philip Basset and Walter de Merton in their place He substituted new sheriffs in all the counties men of character and reputation He placed new governors in most of the castles He changed all the officers of his houshold  d April  He summoned a parliament in which the resumption  of his authority was ratified with only five dissenting voices And the barons after making one fruitless effort to take the King by surprize at Winchester were obliged to acquiesce in those new regulations  M Paris p Chron T Wykes p    THE King in order to cut off every objection to his conduct offered to refer all the differences between him and the earl of Leicester to Margaret queen of France  Rymer vol p  The celebrated integrity of Lewis gave a mighty influence to any decision which issued from his court and Henry probably hoped that the gallantry on which all barons as true knights valued themselves would make them ashamed not to submit to the award of that princess Lewis entirely merited the confidence reposed in him By an admirable conduct probably as political as just he continually interposed his good offices to allay the civil discords of the English He forwarded all healing measures which might give security to both parties And he still endeavoured tho' in vain to sooth by persuasion the fierce ambition of the earl of Leicester and to convince him how much it was his duty to submit peaceably to the authority of his sovereign  THAT bold and artful conspirator wasno wise discouraged with the bad success of his past enterprizes The death of Richard earl of Glocester who was his chief rival in power and who before his decease had joined the royal party seemed to open a new field to his violence and to expose the throne to fresh insults and injuries It was in vain that the King professed his intentions of observing strictly the great charter even of maintaining all the regulations made by the reforming barons at Oxford or afterwards except those which entirely annihilated the royal authority These powerful chieftains now obnoxious to the court could not peaceably resign the hopes of entire independance and uncontrouled power with which they had flattered themselves and which they had so long enjoyed  Civil wars of the barons  Many of them engaged in Leicester's views and among the rest Gilbert the young earl of Glocester who brought him a mighty accession of power from the extensive authority possest by that opulent family Even Henry son of the King of the Romans commonly called Henry d' Allmaine tho' a prince of the blood joined the party of the barons against the King the head of his own family Leicester himself who still resided in France formed secretly the links of this great conspiracy and planned the whole scheme of operations  THE princes of Wales notwithstanding the great power of the monarchs both of the Saxon and Norman line still preserved authority in their own country and tho' they had often been constrained to pay tribute to the crown of England  they were with difficulty retained in subordination or even in peace and almost throughout every reign since the conquest had infested the English frontiers with such petty incursions and sudden inroads as seldom merited to have place in a general history The English still contented with repelling their invasions and chacing them back into their barren mountains had never pursued the advantages obtained against them nor attempted even under their greatest and most active princes a total or so much as a feudal subjection of the country This advantage was reserved to the present King the weakest and most indolent In the year Lewellen prince of Wales declining in years and broke with infirmities but still more harrassed with the rebellion and undutiful behaviour of his son Griffin had recourse to the protection of Henry and consenting to subject his principality which had so long maintained its independance to vassalage under the crown of England purchased security and tranquillity on these dishonourable terms His eldest son and heir David renewed the homage to England and having taken his brother prisoner delivered him into Henry's hands who committed him to custody in the Tower That prince endeavouring to make his escape from confinement lost his life in the attempt and the prince of Wales freed from the apprehensions of so dangerous a rival paid thenceforth less regard to the English monarch and even renewed those incursions by which the Welch during so many ages had been accustomed to infest their borders Lewellyn however the son of Griffin who succeeded to his uncle had been obliged to renew the homage which was now claimed by England as an established right but he was well pleased to inflame those civil discords on which he rested his present security and founded his hopes of future independance He entered into a confederacy with the earl of Leicester and collecting all the force of his principality invaded England with an army of men He ravaged the lands of Roger de Mortimer and of all the barons who adhered to the crown  Chron Dunst vol p  he marched into Cheshire and committed like depredations on prince Edward's territories every place where his disorderly troops appeared was laid waste with fire and sword and tho' Mortimer a gallant and expert soldier made stout resistance it was found necessary that the prince himself should head the army against this invader Edward repulsed prince Lewellen and obliged him to take shelter in the mountains of North Wales But he was prevented from making farther progress against the enemy by the disorders which soon after broke out in England  THE Welsh invasion was the appointed signal for the malecontent barons to rise in arms and Leicester coming over secretly from France collected all the  forces of his party and commenced an open rebellion He seized the person of the bishop of Hereford a prelate very obnoxious to all the inferior clergy on account of his devoted attachment to the court of Rome  Trevet p M West p  Simon bishop of Norwich and John Mansel because they had published the Pope's bull absolving the King and kingdom from their oaths to observe the provisions of Oxford were made prisoners and exposed to the utmost rage of the party The King's demesnes were ravaged with unbounded fury  Trevet p M West p  and as it was Leicester's interest to allure to his side by the hopes of plunder all the disorderly ruffians in England he gave them a general licence to pillage the barons of the opposite party and even all neutral persons But one of the principal resources of his faction was the populace of the cities particularly of London and as he had by his hypocritical pretensions to sanctity and his zeal against Rome engaged all the monks and lower ecclesiastics in his party his dominion over the inferior ranks of men became absolutely uncontrolable Thomas Fitz Richard the mayor of London a furious and licentious man gave the countenance of authority to these disorders in London and having declared war against the substantial citizens he loosened all the bands of government by which that turbulent city was commonly but ill restrained On the approach of Easter the zeal of superstition the appetite for plunder or what is often as prevalent with the populace as either of these motives the pleasure of committing havock and destruction prompted them to attack the unhappy Jews who were first pillaged without resistance and then massacred to the number of five hundred persons  Chron T Wykes p  The Lombard bankers were next exposed to the rage of the people and tho' by taking sanctuary in the churches they escaped with their lives all their money and goods became a prey to the licentious multitude Even the houses of the rich citizens tho' English were attacked by night and way was made by sword and by fire to the depredation of their goods and often to the destruction of their persons The queen who tho' she was defended by the Tower was terrified by the neighbourhood of such dangerous commotions resolved to go by water to the castle of Windsor but as she approached the bridge the populace assembled against her The cry ran  drown the witch  and besides abusing her with the most scurrilous language and pelting her with rotten eggs and dirt they had prepared large stones to sink her barge when she should attempt to shoot the bridge and she was so frightened that she returned to the Tower  Chron T Wykes p    THE violence and fury of Leicester's faction had risen to such a height in all parts of England that the King unable to resist their power was obliged to  set on foot a treaty of peace and to make an accommodation with the barons on the most disadvantageous terms  Chron Dunst vol p Trivet p    th July  He agreed to confirm anew the provisions of Oxford even those which entirely annihilated the royal authority and the barons were again reinstated in the sovereignty of the kingdom They restored Hugh le D'espenser to the office of high justiciary they appointed their own creatures sheriffs in every county of England they took possession of all the royal castles and fortresses they even named all the officers of the King's houshold and they summoned a parliament to meet at Westminster in order to settle more fully their plan of government  th Oct  They here produced a new list of twenty four barons to whom they proposed that the administration should be entirely committed and they insisted that the authority of this junto should continue not only during the reign of the King but also during that of prince Edward  THIS prince who was the life and soul of the royal party had unhappily before the King's accommodation with the barons been taken prisoner by Leicester in a parley at Windsor  M Paris p Trivet p  and this misfortune more than any other incident had determined Henry to submit to the ignominious conditions imposed upon him But having recovered his liberty by the treaty Edward employed his activity in defence of the prerogatives of his family and he gained a large party even among those who had at first adhered with the greatest zeal to the cause of the barons His cousin Henry d' Allmaine Roger Bigod earl Mareshal earl Warrenne Humphrey Bohun earl of Hereford John lord Basset Ralph Basset Hamon l' Estrange Roger Mortimer Henry de Piercy Robert de Brus Roger de Leyborne with almost all the Lords Marchers as they were called on the borders of Wales and Scotland the most warlike parts of the kingdom declared in favour of the royal cause and hostilities which were scarce well composed were again renewed in every part of England But the near balance of the parties joined to the universal clamour of the people obliged the King and barons to open anew the negotiations for peace and it was agreed by both sides to submit the differences entirely to the arbitration of the King of France  M Paris p Chron T Wykes p W Heming p Chron Dunst vol p    Reference to the King of France  THIS virtuous prince the only man who in like circumstances could safely have been intrusted with such an authority by a neighbouring nation had never ceased to interpose his good offices between the English factions and had even during the short interval of peace invited over to Paris both the King and the earl of Leicester in order to accommodate the differences between them but found that the fears and animosities on both sides as well as the ambition of Leicester were so violent as to render all his endeavours ineffectual But when  this solemn appeal ratified by the oaths and subscriptions of the leaders in each faction was made to his judgment he was not discouraged from pursuing his honourable purpose He summoned the states of France at Amiens and there in the presence of that assembly as well as in that of the King of England and Peter de Montfort Leicester's son he brought this great cause to a trial and examination  It appeared to him that the provisions of Oxford even had they not been extorted by force had they not been so exorbitant in their nature and subversive of the antient constitution were expressly established as a temporary expedient and could not without breach of trust be rendered perpetual by the barons  d Jan  He therefore annulled these provisions restored to the King the possession of his castles and the power of nomination to the great offices allowed him to retain what foreigners he pleased in his kingdom and even to confer on them places of trust and dignity and in a word reestablished the royal power on the same footing on which it stood before the meeting of the famous parliament at Oxford But while he thus suppressed dangerous innovations and preserved unimpaired the prerogatives of the English crown he was not negligent of the rights of the people and besides ordering that a general amnesty should be granted for all past offences he declared that his award was not any wise meant to derogate from the privileges and liberties which the nation enjoyed by any former concessions or charters from the crown  Rymer vol p c Chron T Wykes p Knyghton p    THIS equitable sentence was no sooner known in England than Leicester and his confederates determined to reject it and to have recourse to arms in order to procure to themselves more safe and advantageous conditions from the King  Chron Dunst vol p    Renewal of the civil wars  Without regard to his oaths and subscriptions that enterprizing conspirator ordered his two sons Richard and Peter de Montfort in conjunction with Robert de Ferrars earl of Derby to attack the city of Worcester while Henry and Simon de Montfort two others of his sons assisted by the prince of Wales were ordered to commit ravages on the estate of Roger de Mortimer He himself resided at London and employing as his instrument FitzRichard the seditious mayor who had violently and illegally prolonged his authority he wrought up that city to the highest ferment and agitation The populace formed themselves into bands and companies Chose leaders Practised all military exercises Committed violence on all the royalists And to give them greater countenance in their disorders an association was entered into between the city and eighteen great barons never to make peace with the King but by common consent and approbation At the head of those who swore to maintain this association were  the earls of Leicester Glocester and Derby with le d' Espenser the chief justiciary men who had all previously sworn to submit to the award of the French monarch Their only pretence for this breach of faith was that the latter part of Lewis's sentence was as they affirmed a contradiction to the former He ratified the charter of liberties yet annulled the provisions of Oxford which were only calculated as they maintained to preserve that charter and without which in their estimation they had no security for its observance  THE King and prince finding a civil war inevitable prepared themselves for defence and summoning the military vassals from all quarters and being reinforced by Baliol lord of Galloway Brus lord of Annandale Henry Piercy John Comyn  Rymer vol p M West p Ypod Neust p  and other barons of the north they composed an army formidable as well from its numbers as its military prowess and experience The first enterprize of the royalists was the attack of Northampton which was defended by Simon de Montfort with many of the principal barons of that party  th April  And a breach being made in the walls by Philip Basset the place was carried by assault and both the governor and the garrison were made prisoners of war  Chron T Wykes p W Heming p Chron Dunst p M West p  The royalists marched thence to Leicester and

devastation from the animosities of the rival barons than it would have suffered from many years of foreign or even of domestic hostilities conducted by more humane and more generous principles  THE earl of Leicester master of London and of the counties in the south east of England formed the siege of Rochester  M Paris p Chron T Wykes p  which alone held for the King in those parts and which besides earl Warrenne the governor was garrisoned by many noble and powerful barons of the royal party The King and prince hastened from Nottingham where they were then quartered to the relief of the place and on their approach Leicester raised the siege and retreated to London which being the center of his power he was afraid might in his absence fall into the King's hands either by force or by a correspondence with the principal inhabitants who were all of them secretly inclined to the royal cause Reinforced by a body of citizens and having summoned his partizans from  {inverted †} W Heming p Chron Dunst vol p  all quarters he thought himself strong enough to hazard a general battle with the royalists and to determine the fa  e of the nation in one great engagement which if it p  oved successful must be decisive against the King who had no retreat to his broken troops in those parts whi  e Leicester himself in case of any sini  er accident could easily take shelter in the city To give the better colouring to his cause he previously sent a message with conditions of peace to Henry submissive in the language but exorbitant in the demands  M Paris p W Heming p  and when the messenger returned with the lye and defiance from the King the prince and the King of the Romans he sent a new message renouncing in the name of himself and of the associated barons all fealty and allegiance to Henry He then marched out of the city with his army divided into four bodies The first commanded by his two sons Henry and Guy de Mountfort with Humphrey de Bohun earl of Hereford who had deserted to the barons the second led by the earl of Glocester with William de Montchesney and John Fitz John the third composed of Londoners under the command of Nicholas de Segrave The fourth headed by himself in person The bishop of Chichester gave a general absolution to the army accompanied with assurances that if any of them fell in the action they would infallibly be received into heaven as the reward of their suffering in so meritorious a cause  B  of Lewes  May  LEICESTER who possessed great talents for war conducted his march with such skill and secrecy that he had well nigh surprized the royalists in their quarters at Lewes in Sussex But the promptitude of prince Edward soon repaired this negligence and he led out the King's army to the field in three bodies He himself conducted the van attended by earl Warrenne and William de Valence The main body was commanded by the King of the Romans and his son Henry The King himself was placed in the rear at the head of his principal nobility Prince Edward rushed upon the Londoners who had demanded the post of honour in leading the rebel army but who from their want of discipline and experience were ill qualified to resist the gentry and military men of whom the prince's body were composed They were broke in an instant were chased off the field of battle and Edward transported by his martial ardour and eager to

escape beyond sea  Chron T Wykes p  But the prince intrepid amidst the greatest disasters exhorted his troops to revenge the death of their friends to relieve the royal captives and to snatch an easy conquest from an enemy disordered by their own victory  W Heming p  He found his followers intimidated by their situation while Leicester afraid of a sudden and violent blow from the prince amused him by a pretence of negotiation till he was able to recall his troops from the pursuit and to bring them into order  W Heming p  There now appeared no farther resource to the royal party surrounded by the armies and garrisons of the enemy destitute of forage and provisions and deprived of their sovereign as well as of all their principal leaders who could alone inspirit them to an obstinate resistance The prince therefore was obliged to submit to Leicester's terms which were short and severe agreeable to the suddenness and necessity of the situation He stipulated that he and Henry d' Allmain should surrender themselves prisoners as pledges in the place of the two Kings that all other prisoners on both sides should be released  M Paris p Knyghton p  and that in order to settle fully the terms of agreement applications should be made to the King of France that he should name six Frenchmen three prelates and three noblemen These six to choose two others of their own country And these two to choose one Englishman who in conjunction with themselves were to be invested by both parties with full powers to make what regulations they thought proper for the settlement of the kingdom The prince and young Henry accordingly delivered themselves into Leicester's hands who sent them under a guard to Dover castle Such are the terms of agreement commonly called the  Mise  of Lewes from an obsolete French term of that  meaning For it appears that all the gentry and nobility of England who disdained the language of their native country made familiar use of the French till this period and for some time after  LEICESTER had no sooner obtained this great advantage and got the whole royal family in his power than he openly violated every article of the treaty and acted as sole master and even tyrant of the kingdom He still detained the King in effect a prisoner and made use of that prince's authority to purposes the most prejudicial to his interests and the most oppressive of his people  Rymer vol p c  He every where disarmed the royalists and kept all his own partizans in a military posture  Rymer vol p Brady's Appeals N  o  Chron T Wykes p  He observed the same partial conduct in the delivery of the captives and even threw many of the royalists into prison beside those who were taken in the battle of Lewes He carried the King from place to place and obliged all the royal castles under pretence of Henry's commands to receive a governor and garrison of his own appointment All the officers of the crown and of the household were named by him and the whole authority as well as arms of the state was lodged in his hands He instituted in the counties a new kind of magistracy endowed with new and arbitrary powers that of conservators of the peace  Rymer vol p  His rapacious avarice appeared barefaced to the whole nation and were sufficient to make us question the greatness of his ambition at least the largeness of his mind if we had not reason to think that he intended to employ his unbounded acquisitions as the instruments for acquiring farther power and grandeur He seized no less than the estates of eighteen barons as his share of the spoil gained in the battle of Lewes He engrossed to himself the ransom of all the prisoners and told his barons with a wanton insolence that it was sufficient for them that he had saved them by that victory from the forfeitures and attainders which hung over them  Knyghton p  He even treated the earl of Glocester in the same injurious manner and turned to his own profit the ransom of the King of the Romans who had in the field of battle surrendered himself to that nobleman Henry his eldest son made a monopoly of all the wool of the kingdom the only valuable commodity for foreign markets which it at that time produced  Chron T Wykes p  The inhabitants of the cinqueports during the present dissolution of government betook themselves to the most licentious piracy made a prey of the snips of all nations threw the mariners into the sea and by these practices soon banished all merchants from the English coasts and harbours Every foreign commodity rose to an exorbitant price and woollen cloaths which the  English had not then the art of dying were worn by them white and without receiving the last hand of the manufacturer In answer to the complaints which arose on this occasion Leicester replied that the kingdom could well enough subsist within itself and needed no intercourse with foreigners And it was found that he even combined with the pyrates of the cinque ports and received as his share the third of their prizes  Chron T Wykes p    NO farther mention was made of the reference to the King of France so essential an article in the agreement of Lewes and Leicester summoned a parliament composed altogether of his own partizans in order to rivet by their authority that power which he had acquired by so much violence and which he used with so much tyranny and injustice An ordinance was there passed to which the King's consent had been previously extorted that every act of royal power should be exercised by a council of nine persons who were to be chosen and removed by the majority of three Leicester himself the earl of Glocester and the bishop of Chichester  Rymer vol p Brady's App N  o    By this intricate plan of government the scepter was really put into Leicester's hands as he had the entire direction of the bishop of Chichester and thereby commanded all the resolutions of the council of three who could appoint or discard at pleasure every member of the supreme council  BUT it was impossible that things could long remain in this strange situation It behoved Leicester either to descend with some danger into the rank of a subject or to mount up with no less into that of a sovereign and his exorbitant ambition unrestrained by any fear or principle gave too much reason to suspect him of the latter intention Mean while he was exposed to anxiety from every quarter and felt that smallest incident was capable of overturning that immense and ill cemented fabric which he had reared The Queen whom her husband had left abroad had collected in foreign parts an army of desperate adventurers and had assembled a great number of ships with a view of invading the kingdom and of bringing relief to her unfortunate family Lewis detesting Leicester's usurpations and perjuries and disgusted by the refusal of the English barons to submit to his award favoured all her enterprizes and was generally believed to be making preparations for the fame purpose An English army by the pretended authority of the captive King was assembled on the sea coast to oppose this projected invasion  Brady's App N  o  Chron Dunst vol p M West p  but Leicester owed his security more to cross winds which long detained and at last dissipated and broke the Queen's fleet than to  any resistance which in their present situation could be expected from the English  Chron Mailr p Chron T Wykes p    LEICESTER found himself better able to resist the spiritual thunders which were levelled against him The Pope still adhering to the King's cause against the barons dispatched cardinal Guido as his legate into England with orders to excommunicate the three earls Leicester Glocester and Norfolk by name and all others in general who concurred in the oppression and captivity of their sovereign  Rymer vol p Chron Dunst vol p  Leicester menaced the legate with death if he set his foot within the kingdom but Guido meeting in France the bishops of Winchester London and Worcester who had been sent thither on a negociation commanded them under the penalty of ecclesiastical censures to carry his bull into England and to publish it against the barons When the prelates arrived off the coast they were boarded by the pyratical mariners of the cinque ports to whom probably they gave a hint of the cargo which they brought along with them The bull was torn and thrown into the sea which furnished the artful prelates with a plausible excuse for not obeying the orders of the legate  M Paris p T Wykes p  Leicester appealed from Guido to the Pope in person but before his ambassadors could reach Rome to defend his cause the Pope was dead and they found the legate himself from whom they had appealed seated on the papal throne under the name of Urban IV That daring leader was no wise dismayed with this event and as he found that a great part of his popularity in England was founded on his opposition to Rome which was now become odious he persisted with the more obstinacy in the prosecution of his measures  th January  THAT he might both encrease and turn to advantage his popularity Leicester summoned a new parliament in London where he knew his power was uncontrolable he fixed this assembly on a more democratical basis than any which had ever been summoned since the foundation of the English monarchy Besides the barons of his own party and several ecclesiastics who were not immediate tenants of the crown  House of commons  he ordered returns to be made of two knights from every shire and what is more remarkable of deputies from the buroughs which had always in former ages been esteemed of too mean a rank to be allowed a place in the national councils  Rymer vol p  This period is commonly esteemed the epoch of the house of commons of England and it is certainly the first time that mention is made by historians of any representatives sent to parliament by the boroughs In  all the general accounts given in preceding times of parliaments the nobility and barons are only spoke of by historians as the constituent members and even in the most particular narratives delivered of parliamentary transactions as in the trial of Thomas a Becket where the events of each day and almost of each hour are carefully recorded by contemporary authors  Fitz Stephen Hist Quadrip Hoveden c  there is not throughout the whole the least appearance of a house of commons But tho' that house derived its first existence from so precarious and even so invidious an origin as Leicester's usurpation it proved soon when summoned by the legal princes one of the most useful and in process of time one of the most powerful members of the national constitution and gradually rescued the kingdom from aristocratical as well as from regal tyranny But Leicester's policy if we must ascribe to him so great a blessing only forwarded by some years an institution for which the general state of things had already prepared the nation and it is otherwise inconceivable that a plant set by so inauspicious a hand could have attained to so vigorous a growth and have flourished in the midst of such tempests and convulsions The feudal system with which the liberty much more the power of the commons was totally incompatible began gradually to decline and both King and people who felt its inconveniences contributed to favour this new power which was more submissive than the barons to the regular authority of the crown and at the same time afforded protection to the inferior orders of the state  LEICESTER having thus assembled a parliament of his own model and trusting to the attachment of the populace of London seized the opportunity of crushing his rivals among the powerful barons Robert de Ferrars earl of Derby was accused in the King's name seized and committed to custody without being brought to any legal trial  Chron T Wykes p Ann Waverl p  John Gifford menaced with the same fate fled from London and took shelter in the marches of Wales Even the earl of Glocester whose power and influence had so much contributed to the success of the barons but who was of late extremely disgusted by Leicester's arbitrary and insolent conduct who engrossed the whole power of the party found himself in danger from the prevailing authority of his antient confederate and he retired from parliament  M Paris p Ann Waverl p  This known division among the leaders gave courage to all Leicester's enemies and to the King's friends who were now sure of protection from so potent a leader Tho' Roger Mortimer Hamon L'estrange and other powerful marchers of Wales had been obliged to leave the kingdom their authority still remained over the territories subjected to their jurisdiction and there were many others who were disposed to give disturbance to the new government  The animosities inseparable from the feudal aristocracy broke out with such fresh violence and threatened the kingdom with new convulsions and disorders  THE earl of Leicester surrounded with these difficulties embraced a measure from which he proposed to reap some present advantages but which proved in the end the source of all his future calamities The active and intrepid prince Edward had languished in prison ever since the fatal battle of Lewes and being extremely popular in the kingdom there arose a general desire of seeing him again restored to liberty  Knyghton p  As Leicester found that he could with difficulty oppose the concurring wishes of the nation he stipulated with the prince that in return he should order his adherents to deliver up to the barons all their castles particularly those on the borders of Wales and should swear neither to depart the kingdom during three years nor introduce into it any foreign forces  Ann Waverl p  The King took an oath to the same effect and he also passed a charter in which he confirmed the agreement or  mise  of Lewis and even permitted his subjects to rise in arms against him if he should ever attempt to infringe it  Blackerton's Mag Charta p Chron Dunst vol p  So little care had Leicester taken tho' he constantly made use of the authority of this captive prince to preserve to him any appearance of royalty or kingly prerogatives  th March  IN consequence of this treaty prince Edward was brought into Westminsterhall and was declared free by the barons But instead of really recovering his liberty as he had vainly expected he found that the whole transaction was a fraud on the part of Leicester that he still continued a prisoner at large and was strictly guarded by the emissaries of that nobleman and that while the faction reaped all the benefit from the performance of his part of the treaty care was taken that he himself should enjoy no advantage by it As Glocester on his rupture with the barons had retired for safety to his estates on the borders of Wales Leicester followed him with an army to Hereford  Chron T Wykes p Ann Waverl p W Heming p Chron Dunst vol p  continued still to menace and negotiate and that he might add authority to his cause he carried both the King and prince along with him The earl of Glocester here concerted with young Edward the manner of that prince's escape He found means to convey to him a horse of an extraordinary swiftness and appointed Roger Mortimer who had returned into the kingdom to be ready at hand with a small party to receive the prince and to guard him to a place of safety  th May  Edward pretended to take the air with some of Leicester's retinue who were his guards and making matches between their horses after he thought he had tired and blown them sufficiently he suddenly mounted Glocester's horse called to his  attendants that he had long enough enjoyed the pleasure of their company and now bid them adieu They followed him for some space without being able to overtake him and the appearance of Mortimer with his company put an end to their pursuit  M Paris p Chron T Wykes p Ann Waverl p W Heming p Knyghton p    THE royalists secretly prepared for this happy event immediately flew to arms and the joy of this gallant prince's delivery the oppressions under which the nation laboured the expectation of a new scene of affairs and the countenance of the earl of Glocester procured Edward an army which Leicester was utterly unable to withstand  Chron T Wykes p  This nobleman found himself in a remote quarter of the kingdom surrounded by his enemies barred of all communication with his friends by the Severne whose bridges Edward had broke down  Chron Dunst vol p  and obliged to fight the cause of his party under such multiplied disadvantages In this extremity he wrote to his son Simon de Montfort to hasten from London with an army for his relief and Simon had advanced to Kenilworth with that view where fancying that all Edward's force and attention were directed against his father he lay perfectly secure and unguarded But the prince making a sudden and forced march surprized him in his camp dissipated his army and took the earl of Oxford and many other noblemen prisoners almost without resistance  M Paris p Chron Mailr p Chron T Wykes p Ann Waverl p W Heming p Knyghton p  Leicester ignorant of his son's fate passed the Severne in boats during Edward's absence and lay at Evesham in expectation of being every hour joined by his friends from London  Battle of Evesham and death of Leicester th August  When the prince who made profit of every favourable moment appeared in the field before him Edward made a body of his troops advance from the road which led to Kenilworth and ordered them to carry the banners taken from Simon's army while he himself making a circuit with the rest of his army proposed to attack the enemy from the other quarter  M Paris p Chron Mailr p  Leicester was long deceived by this stratagem and took one division of Edward's army for his friends but at last perceiving his mistake and observing the great superiority and excellent disposition of the royalists he exclaimed that they had learned from him their military order adding  "The Lord have mercy on our souls for I see our bodies are the prince's  M Paris p W Heming p Knyghton p  "  The battle immediately began tho' on very unequal terms Leicester's army by living in the mountains of Wales without bread which was not then much used among the inhabitants  Chron T Wykes p  had been extremely weakened by sickness and desertion and was soon broke by  the victorious royalists while his Welsh allies accustomed to a desultory kind of war immediately took to flight and were pursued with great slaughter  Knyghton p  Leicester himself asking for quarter was slain in the heat of the action with his eldest son Henry Hugh le d'Espenser and about one hundred and sixty knights and many other gentlemen of his party The old King had been purposely placed by the rebels in the front of the battle and being clad in armour and thereby not known by his friends he received an wound and was in danger of his life But crying out  I am Henry of Winchester your king  he was saved and put in a place of security by his son who flew to his assistance  Chron de Mailr p W Heming p    THE violence ingratitude tyranny rapacity and treachery of the earl of Leicester give a very bad idea of his moral character and make us regard his death as the most happy event which in this conjuncture could have happened to the English nation Yet must we allow the man to have possessed great abilities and the appearance of great virtues who tho' a stranger could at a time when strangers were the most odious and the most universally decried have acquired so extensive an interest in the kingdom and have so nearly paved his way to the throne itself His military capacity and his political craft were equally eminent He possessed the talents both of governing men and conducting business And tho' his ambition was boundless it seems neither to have exceeded his courage nor his genius and he had the happiness of making the low populace as well as the haughty barons cooperate towards the success of his selfish and dangerous purposes A prince of greater ability and vigour than Henry might have directed the talents of this nobleman either to the exaltation of his throne or to the good of his people But the advantages given to Leicester by the weak and variable administration of the King brought on the ruin of royal authority and produced infinite confusions in the kingdom which indeed in the end preserved and extremely improved the national liberty and constitution His popularity even after his death continued so great that tho' excommunicated by Rome the people believed him to be a saint and many miracles were said to be wrought upon his tomb  Chron de Mailr p    Settlement of the government  THE victory of Evesham with the death of Leicester proved decisive in favour of the royalists and made an equal tho' a very opposite impression on friends and enemies in every part of England The King of the Romans recovered his liberty The other prisoners of the royal party were not only freed but courted by their keepers FitzRichard the seditious mayor of London who had marked out forty of the most wealthy citizens for slaughter immediately stopped his hand on receiving news of this great event And almost all the castles garrisoned by  the barons hastened to make their submissions and to open their gates to the King The isle of Axholme alone and that of Ely trusting to the strength of their situation ventured to make resistance but were at last reduced as well as the castle of Dover by the valour and activity of prince Edward  M Paris p W Heming p    Adam de Gourdon a courageous baron maintained himself some time in the forests of Hampshire committed depredations on the neighbourhood and obliged the prince to lead a body of troops into that country against him Edward attacked the camp of the rebels and being transported by the ardour of action leapt over the trench with a few followers and encountered Gourdon himself in single combat The victory was long disputed between these valiant combattants but ended at last in the prince's favour who wounded his antagonist threw him from his horse and took him prisoner He not only granted him his life but introduced him that very night to the queen at Guilford procured him his pardon restored him to his estate received him into favour and was ever after very faithfully served by him  M Paris p    A total victory of the sovereign over so extensive a rebellion commonly produces a revolution of government and strengthens as well as enlarges for some time the prerogatives of the crown Yet no sacrifices of national liberty were made on this occasion the great charter remained still inviolate and the King sensible that his own barons by whose assistance alone he had prevailed were no less jealous of their independance than the other party seems thenceforth to have more carefully abstained from all those exertions of arbitrary power which had afforded so plausible a pretence to the rebels The clemency of this victory is also remarkable No blood was shed on the scaffold No attainders except of the Mountfort family were executed And tho' a parliament assembled at Winchester forfeited all those who had borne arms against the King easy compositions were made with them for their lands  M Paris p  and the highest sum levied on the most notorious offenders exceeded not five years rent of their estate Even the earl of Derby who again rebelled after having been pardoned and restored to his fortune was obliged to pay only seven years rent and was a second time restored The mild disposition of the King and the prudence of the prince tempered the insolence of victory and gradually restored order to the several members of the state disjointed by so long a continuance of civil wars and commotions  THE city of London which had carried farthest the rage and animosity against the King and which seemed determined to stand upon its defence after almost  all the kingdom had submitted was after some interval restored to most of its liberties and privileges and Fitz Richard the mayor who had been guilty of so much illegal violence was only punished by fine and imprisonment The countess of Leicester the King's sister who had been extremely forward in all attacks on the royal family was dismissed the kingdom with her two sons Simon and Guy  Chron T Wykes p  who proved very ungrateful for this lenity Five years afterwards they assassinated at Viterbo in Italy their cousin Henry d' Allmaine who at that very time was endeavouring to make their peace with the King and by taking sanctuary in the church of the Franciscans they escaped the punishment due to so great an enormity  Rymer vol p vol p Chron T Wykes p  W Heming p  Trevet p    THE merits of the earl of Glocester after he returned to his allegiance had been so great in restoring the prince to his liberty and assisting him in his victories against the rebellious barons that it was almost impossible to content him in his demands and his youth and temerity as well as his great power tempted him on some new disgust to raise again the flames of rebellion in the kingdom The mutinous populace of London at his instigation took to arms and the prince was obliged to collect an army of men in order to suppress them  Chron T Wykes p  Even this second rebellion did not provoke the King to any acts of cruelty and the earl of Glocester himself escaped with a total impunity He was only obliged to enter into a bond of marks that he never again would be guilty of rebellion  Chron T Wykes p    A strange method of enforcing the laws and a proof of the dangerous independance of the barons in those ages These potent nobles were from the danger of the example averse to the execution of the laws of forfeiture and felony against any of their brethren tho' they could not with a good grace refuse to concur in obliging them to fulfill any voluntary contract and engagement into which they had entered  THE prince finding the state of the kingdom tolerably composed was seduced by his avidity for glory and by the prejudices of the age as well as by the earnest soliicitations of the King of France to undertake an expedition against the infidels in the Holy Land  M Paris p    and he endeavoured previously to settle the state in such a manner as to dread no bad effects from his absence As the dangerous power and turbulent disposition of the earl of Glocester gave him apprehensions he insisted on carrying him along with him in consequence of a vow  which that nobleman had made to undertake the same voyage  and in the mean time he obliged him to resign some of his castles and to enter into a new bond not to disturb the peace of the kingdom  Chron T Wykes p  He sailed from England with an army and arrived in Lewis's camp before Tunis in Africa where he found that great monarch already dead from the intemperance of the climate and the fatigues of his enterprize The great and only weakness of this prince was his imprudent zeal for Croisades but it was this prepossession chiefly that procured him from the clergy the title of St Lewis by which he is known in the French history and if that appellation had not been so extremely prostituted by the Romish church as to become rather a term of reproach he seems by his uniform probity and goodness as well as his piety to have fully merited the title He was succeeded by his son Philip denominated the Hardy a prince of some merit tho' much inferior to that of his father  PRINCE Edward not discouraged by this event continued his voyage to the Holy Land where he signalized himself by acts of valour Revived the glory of the English name in those parts And struck such terror into the Saracens that they employed an assassin to murder him who wounded him in the arm but perished in the attempt  M Paris p W Heming p  Mean while his absence from England was attended with many of those pernicious consequences which had been dreaded from it The laws were not executed The barons oppressed the common people with impunity  Chron Dunst vol p  They gave shelter on their estates to bands of robbers whom they employed in committing ravages on the estates of their enemies The populace of London returned to their usual licentiousness And the old King unequal to the burthen of government called aloud for his gallant son to return  Rymer vol p M Paris p  and to assist him in swaying that scepter which was ready to drop from his feeble and uncertain hands  th Novr Death  At last overcome by the cares of government and the infirmities of age he visibly declined and he expired at St Edmondsbury in the th year of his age and th of his reign the longest reign which is to be met with in the English annals His brother the King of the Romans for he never attained the title of emperor died about seven months before him  and character of the King  THE most obvious circumstances of Henry the third's character is his incapacity for government which rendered him as much a prisoner in the hands of his own ministers and favourites and as little at his own disposal as when detained a captive in the hands of his enemies From this source rather than from insincerity or treachery arose his negligence in observing his promises and he was  too easily induced for the sake of present convenience to sacrifice the lasting advantages arising from the trust and confidence of his people Hence were derived his profusion to favourites his attachment to strangers the variableness of his conduct his hasty resentments and his sudden forgiveness and return of affection Instead of reducing the dangerous power of his nobles by obliging them to observe the laws towards their inferiors and setting them the salutary example in his own government he was seduced to imitate their conduct and to make his arbitrary will or rather that of his ministers the rule of his actions Instead of accommodating himself by a strict frugality to the embarrassed situation in which his revenue had been left by the military expeditions of his uncle the dissipations of his father and the usurpations of the barons he was tempted to levy money by irregular exactions which without inriching himself impoverished at least disgusted his people Of all men nature seemed least to have fitted him for being a tyrant yet are there instances of oppression in his reign which tho' derived from the precedents left him by his predecessors had been carefully guarded against by the great charter and are inconsistent with all rules of good government And on the whole we may say that greater abilities with his good dispositions would have prevented him from falling into his faults or with worse dispositions would have enabled him to maintain and defend them  THIS prince was noted for his piety and devotion and his regular attendance on public worship and a saying of his on that head is much celebrated by antient writers He was engaged in a dispute with Lewis IX of France concerning the preference between sermons and masses He maintained the superiority of the latter and affirmed that he would rather have one hour's conversation with a friend than hear twenty the most elaborate discourses pronounced in praise of him  Walsing Edw p    HENRY left two sons Edward his successor and Edmond earl of Lancaster and two daughters Margaret queen of Scotland and Beatrix dutchess of Brittanny He had five other children who died in their infancy  Miscellaneous transac  ions of this reign  THE following are the most remarkable laws enacted during this reign There had been great disputes between the civil and ecclesiastical courts about bastardy The common law had deemed all those bastards who were born before wedlock By the canon law they were ligitimate And when any dispute of inheritance arose it had been formerly usual for the civil courts to issue writs to the spiritual directing them to enquire into the legitimacy of the person The bishop always returned an answer agreeable to the canon law tho' contrary to  the municipal law of the kingdom For this reason the civil courts had changed the nature of their writ and instead of requiring the spiritual courts to enquire concerning the legitimacy of the person they only proposed the simple question of fact whether he was born before or after the marriage The prelates complained of this practice to the parliament assembled at Merton in the twentieth of this King and desired that the civil law might be rendered conformable to the canon But received from all the nobility the memorable reply  Nolumus leges Angliae mutare  We will not change the laws of England  Statute of Merton chap    AFTER the civil wars the parliament summoned at Marlebridge gave their approbation to most of the ordinances which had been enacted by the reforming barons and which tho' advantageous to the security of the people had not received the sanction of a proper authority Among other laws it was there enacted that all appeals from the courts of inferior lords should be carried directly to the King's courts without passing thro' the courts of the lords immediately superior  Statute of Marleb chap  It was ordained that money should bear no interest during the minority of the creditor  Id Chap  This law was very reasonable as the estates of minors were always in the hands of their lords and the creditors could not pay interest where they had no revenue The charter of King John had granted this indulgence It was omitted in that of Henry III for what reason is unknown but it was renewed in the statute of Marlebridge Most of the other articles of this statute are calculated to restrain the oppressions of sheriffs and the violences and iniquities committed in distraining cattle and other goods Cattle and the instruments of husbandry composed at that time the chief riches of the people  IN the th year of this King an assize was fixed of bread the price of which was settled according to the different prices of corn from one shilling a quarter to seven shillings and six pence  Statutes at large p  These great variations alone are a proof of bad tillage Yet did the prices often rise much higher than any taken notice of by the laws The Chronicle of Dunstable tells us that in this reign wheat was once sold for a mark nay for a pound a quarter that is three pounds of our present money  So also Knyghton p  The same law affords us a proof of the little communication between the parts of the kingdom by remarking the very different prices which the same commodity bore at the same time A brewer says the statute may sell two gallons of ale for a penny in cities and three or four gallons for the same price in the country At present such commodities by the great consumpt of the people and the great stocks of the brewers are rather cheapest in cities The  Chronicle of Dunstable observes that wheat one year was sold in many places for eight shillings a quarter but never rose in Dunstable above a crown  THO' commerce was still very low it seems rather to have encreased since the Conquest at least if we may judge of the encrease of money by the price of bread The medium between the highest and lowest prices of wheat assigned by the statute is four shillings and three pence a quarter that is twelve shillings and nine pence of our present money This is near the half of the middling price in our time Yet the middling price of cattle so late as the reign of King Richard we found to be above eight times lower than the present Is not the true inference from comparing these facts that in all uncivilized nations cattle which propagate of themselves bear always a lower price than corn which requires more art and stock to raise it than these nations are possessed of It is to be remarked that Henry's assize of corn was copied from a preceding assize established by King John and consequently the prices which we have here compared of corn and cattle may be looked on as contemporary and they were drawn not from one particular year but from an estimation of the middling prices It is true the prices assigned by the assize of Richard were meant as a standard for the accompts of sheriffs and escheators and as considerable profits were allowed to them we may naturally suppose that the common value of cattle was somewhat higher Yet still so great a difference between the prices of corn and cattle as that of four to one compared to the present rates affords important reflections concerning the very different state of industry and tillage in the two periods  INTEREST had in that age mounted to an enormous height as might be expected from the barbarism of the times and mens ignorance of commerce There are instances of fifty per cent payed for money  M Paris p  Such profits tempted the Jews to remain in England notwithstanding the grievous oppressions to which they were continually exposed from the prevalent bigotry and rapine of the age It is easy to imagine how precarious their state must be under an indigent prince somewhat restrained in his tyranny over his native subjects but who possessed an unlimited authority over them the sole proprietors of money in the kingdom and hated on account of their riches their religion and their usury Yet will our ideas scarce come up to the extortions which in fact we shall find to have been practiced upon them In the year marks were exacted from them  M Paris p  Two years after money was again extorted and one Jew alone Aaron of York was obliged to pay above marks  M Paris p  In Henry renewed  his oppressions and the same Aaron was condemned to pay him marks upon an accusation of forgery  M Paris p  The high penalty imposed upon him and which it seems he was thought able to pay is rather a presumption of his innocence than of hisguilt In the King demanded marks from the Jews and threatened to hang them if they refused compliance They now lost all patience and desired leave to retire with their effects out of the kingdom But the King replied  "How can I remedy the oppressions you complain of I am myself beggared I am despoiled I am stripped of all my revenues I owe above marks and if I had said I should not exceed the truth I am obliged to pay my son prince Edward marks a year I have not a farthing and I must have money from any hand from any quarter or by any means"  He then delivered over the Jews to the earl of Cornwal that those whom the one brother had flead the other might embowel to make use of the words of the historian  M Paris p  King John his father once demanded marks from a Jew of Bristol and on his refusal ordered one of his teeth to be drawn every day till he should consent The Jew lost seven teeth and then paid the sum required of him  M Paris p    To give a better pretence to extortions the improbable and absurd accusation which has been at different times advanced against that nation was revived in England that they had crucified a child in derision of our Saviour's sufferings Eighteen of them were hanged at once for this crime  M Paris p  Tho' it is no wise credible that even the antipathy born them by the Christians and the oppressions under which they laboured would ever have pushed them to be guilty of that dangerous enormity But it is natural to imagine that a race exposed to such insults and indignities both from King and people and who had so uncertain an enjoyment of their riches would carry usury to the greatest extremities and by their great profits make themselves some compensation for their continued perils  Commerce must be in a wretched condition where interest was so high and where the sole proprietors of money were exposed to such rapine and injustice But the bad police of the country was another obstacle to all improvements and rendered all communication dangerous and all property precarious The Chronicle of Dunstable says  Vol p  that men during this reign were never secure in their houses and that whole villages were often plundered by bands of robbers tho' no civil wars prevailed in the kingdom In some years before the insurrection of the barons two merchants of Brabant came to the King at Winchester and told him that they had been despoiled of all their goods by certain robbers  whom they knew because they saw their faces every day in his court that like practices prevailed all over England and travellers were every day robbed bound wounded and murdered that these crimes escaped with impunity because the ministers of justice themselves were in a confederacy with the robbers and that they for their part instead of bringing matters to a fruitless trial by law were willing tho' merchants to try their cause with the robbers by arms and a duel The King provoked at these abuses ordered a jury to be inclosed and to try the robbers The jury tho' consisting of twelve men of property in Hampshire were found to be also in a confederacy with the robbers and acquitted them Henry in a rage committed the jury to prison threatened them with severe punishment and ordered a new jury to be enclosed who dreading the fate of their fellows at last found a verdict against the criminals Many of the King's own houshold were discovered to have participated in the guilt and said for their excuse that they received no wages from him and were obliged to rob for a maintenance  M Paris p    Knights and esquires  says the Dictum of Kenelworth  who were robbers if they have no land shall pay the half of their goods and find sufficient security to keep henceforth the peace of the kingdom  Such were the manners of the times  ONE can the less repine during the prevalence of such manners at the frauds and forgeries of the clergy as it gives much less disturbance to society to take mens money from them with their own consent tho' by deceits and lies than to ravish it by open force and violence During this reign the papal power was at its summit and was even beginning insensibly to decline by reason of the immeasurable avarice and extortions of the court of Rome which disgusted the clergy as well as laity in every kingdom of Europe England itself tho' sunk in the deepest abyss of ignorance and superstition had seriously entertained thoughts of shaking off the papal yoke  M Paris p  and the Roman pontiff was obliged to think of new expedients for rivetting it faster upon them For this purpose Gregory IX published his decretals  Trevet p  which are a collection of forgeries favourable to the court of Rome and consist of the supposed decrees of Popes in the first centuries But these forgeries are so gross and confound so palpably all language history chronology and antiquities matters more stubborn than any speculative truths whatever that even that church which is not startled at the most monstrous contradictions and absurdities has been obliged to abandon them to the critics But in the dark age of the thirteenth century they passed for undisputed and authentic and men entangled in the mazes of this false literature joined to the philosophy equally false of the times had nothing wherewithal  to defend themselves but some small remains of common sense which passed for profaneness and impiety and the indelible regard to selfinterest which as it was the sole motive in the priests for framing these impostures served also in some degree to protect the laity against them  ANOTHER expedient devised by the church of Rome in this period for securing its power was the institution of new religious orders and chiefly the Dominicans and Franciscans who proceeded with all the zeal and success that attend novelties were better qualified to gain the populace than the old orders now become rich and indolent maintained a perpetual rivalship with each other in promoting their gainful superstitions and acquired a great dominion over the minds and consequently over the purses of men by counterfeiting a desire of poverty and a contempt for riches The quarrels which arose between these orders lying still under the controul of the sovereign pontiff never disturbed the peace of the church and served only as a spur to their industry in promoting the common cause and tho' the Dominicans lost some popularity by their denial of the immaculate conception a point in which they unwarily engaged too far to be able to recede with honour they counterballanced this disadvantage by acquiring more solid establishments by gaining the confidence of kings and princes and by exercising the jurisdiction assigned them of ultimate judges and punishers of heresy Thus the several orders of monks became a kind of regular troops or garrisons of the Romish church and tho' the temporal interests of society still more those of true piety were hurt by their various devices to catch the populace they proved the chief supports of that mighty fabric of superstition and till the revival of true learning secured it from any dangerous

ScotlandThat kingdom again subduedagain revoltsis again subduedRobert BruceThird revolt of ScotlandDeath and character of the Kingmiscellaneous transactions of this reign  THE English were as yet so little trained to obedience under a regular government that the death of almost every King since the Conquest had been attended with disorders and the council reflecting on the recent civil wars and on the animosities which naturally remain after these great convulsions had reason to apprehend very dangerous consequences from the absence of the son and successor of Henry They therefore hastened to proclaim prince Edward to swear allegiance to him and to summon the states of the kingdom in order to provide for the public peace in this important conjuncture  Rymer vol p Walsing p Trevet p  Walter Giffard archbishop of York the earl of Cornwal son of Richard King of the Romans and the earl of Glocester were appointed guardians of the kingdom and proceeded peaceably to the exercise of their authority without either meeting with opposition from any of the people or being disturbed with emulation and faction among themselves The high character acquired by Edward during the late commotions his military genius his success in subduing the rebels his moderation in settling the kingdom had procured him great esteem mixt with affection among all orders of men and no one could reasonably entertain hopes of making any advantage of his absence or of raising disturbance in the nation The earl of Glocester himself whose great power and turbulent spirit had excited  most jealousy was forward to give proofs of his allegiance and any malecontents who remained being destitute of a leader were obliged to remain in submission to the government  Prince Edward had reached Sicily in his return from the Holy Land when he received information of the death of his father and he discovered a deep concern on this occasion At the same time he learned the death of an infant son John whom his princess Eleanor of Castile had born him at Acre in Palestine and as he appeared much less affected with that misfortune the King of Sicily expressed a surprize at this difference of sentiment But was told by Edward that the death of a son was a loss which he might hope to repair the death of a father was a loss irreparable  Walsingh p Trevet p    EDWARD proceeded homewards but as he soon learned the quiet settlement of the kingdom he was in no hurry to take possession of the throne but spent near a year in France before he made his appearance in England  In his passage by Chalons in Burgundy he was challenged by the prince of that country to a tournament which he was preparing and as Edward excelled in these martial and dangerous exercises the true image of war he declined not the opportunity of acquiring honour and renown in that great assembly of the neighbouring nobles But the image of war was here unfortunately turned into the thing itself Edward and his retinue were so successful in the jousts that the French knights provoked at their superiority made a serious attack upon them which was repulsed and a good deal of blood was idly shed in the quarrel  Walsing p Trevet p M West p  This rencounter received the name of the petty battle of Chalons  EDWARD went from Chalons to Paris and did homage to Philip for the dominions which he held in France  Walsin p    He thence returned to Guienne and gave a settlement to that province which was in some confusion He made his journey by land into England in his passage he accommodated at Montreuil a difference with Margaret countess of Flanders heiress of that territory  Rymer vol p    th August  he was received with joyful acclamations by his people and was solemnly crowned at Westminster by Robert archbishop of Canterbury  Civil administration of the King  THE King immediately applied himself to the reestablishment of his kingdom and to the correcting of those disorders which the civil commotions and the loose administration of his father had introduced into every part of government The plan of his policy was equally generous and prudent He considered the great barons both as the immediate rivals of the crown and the oppressors of the people  and he proposed by an exact distribution of justice and a rigid execution of the laws to give at once protection to the inferior orders of the state and to diminish the arbitrary power of the great on which their dangerous authority was chiefly founded Making it a rule of his own conduct to observe except on extraordinary occasions the privileges secured to them by the great charter he acquired a right to insist upon their observance of the same charter towards their vassals and inferiors and he made the crown be regarded by all the gentry and commonalty of the kingdom as the great fountain of justice and the general assylum against oppression  th Feb  Besides enacting several excellent statutes in a parliament which he summoned at Westminster he took care to inspect the conduct of all his magistrates and judges to displace such as were either negligent or corrupt to provide them with sufficient force for the execution of justice to root out all bands and confederacies of robbers and to repress those more silent robberies which were committed either by the power of the nobles or under the countenance of public authority By this rigid administration the face of the kingdom was soon changed and order and justice took place of violence and oppression But amidst the excellent institutions and publicspirited plans of Edward there still appears somewhat both of the severity of his personal character and of the prejudices of the times  AS the various kinds of malefactors the murderers robbers incendiaries ravishers and plunderers had become so numerous and powerful that the ordinary ministers of justice especially in the western counties were afraid to execute the laws against them the King found it necessary to provide an extraordinary remedy for the evil and he erected for the punishment of crimes a new tribunal which however useful would have been deemed in times of more regular liberty a very great stretch of illegal and arbitrary power It consisted of commissioners who were empowered to enquire into disorders and crimes of all kinds and to inflict the proper punishments upon them The officers charged with this unusual commission made their circuits throughout the counties of England most infected with this evil and carried terror into all those parts of the kingdom In their zeal to punish crimes they did not sufficiently distinguish between the innocent and guilty the smallest suspicion became the ground of accusation and trial the slightest evidence was received against criminals the prisons were crowded with malefactors real or pretended severe fines were levied for small offences and the King tho' his exhausted revenue was supplied by this expedient found it necessary to stop the course of so great rigour and after terrifying and  dissipating by this tribunal the gangs of disorderly people in England he very prudently annuiled the commission  Spellman's Gloss in verbo Trailbaston But Spellman was either mistaken in placing this commission in the fifth year of the King or it was renewed in See Rymer vol p Trivet p M West p  and never afterwards renewed it  AMONG the various disorders to which the kingdom was subject no one was more universally complained of than the adulteration of the coin and as this crime required more art than the English of that age who chiefly employed force and violence in their iniquities were possessed of the imputation fell chiefly upon the Jews  Walsin p Heming vol p  Edward also seems to have indulged a strong prepossession against that nation and this illjudged zeal for Christianity being naturally augmented by an expedition to the Holy Land he let loose the whole rigour of his justice against this unhappy people Two hundred and eighty of them were hanged at once for this crime in London alone besides those who suffered in other parts of the kingdom  T Wykes p  The houses and lands for the Jews had of late ventured to make purchases of that kind as well as the goods of great multitudes were sold and confiscated And the King left it should be suspected that the riches of the sufferers were the chief part of their guilt ordered one half of the money raised by these confiscations to be set apart and bestowed upon such as were willing to be converted to Christianity But the resentment of their injuries was more prevalent over them than the temptation from their poverty and very few of them could be induced by interest to embrace the religion of their persecutors The miseries of this people were not here terminated Tho' the arbitrary talliages and exactions levied upon them had yielded a constant and a considerable revenue to the crown Edward prompted by his zeal and rapacity resolved some time after  In the year  to purge the kingdom entirely of that hated race and to seize to himself at once their whole property as the reward of his labour  Walsin p Heming vol p Trivet p  He left them only money sufficient to bear their charges into foreign countries where new persecutions and extortions awaited them But the inhabitants of the cinque ports imitating the bigotry and avidity of their sovereign despoiled most of them of this small pittance and even threw many of the Jews into the sea A crime for which the King who was determined to be the sole plunderer in his dominions inflicted a capital punishment upon them No less than fifteen thousand Jews were at this time robbed of their effects and banished the kingdom Very few of that nation have since lived in England And as it is impossible for a kingdom to subsist without lenders of money and none will lend without a compensation the practice of usury as it was then called was thenceforth exercised by the English  themselves upon their fellowcitizens or by Lombards and other foreigners It is very much to be questioned whether the dealings of these new usurers were equally open and unexceptionable with those of the old By a law of Richard it was enacted that three copies should be made of every bond given to a Jew one to be put into the hands of a public magistrate another into those of a man of credit and a third to remain with the Jew himself  Trivet p  But as the canon law seconded by the municipal permitted no Christian to receive interest all transactions of this kind must after the banishment of the Jews have become more secret and clandestine and the lender of consequence be paid both for the use of his money and for the infamy and danger which he incurred by lending it  THE great poverty of the crown tho' no excuse was probably the cause of this egregious tyranny exercised against the Jews but Edward practised also other more honourable means of remedying that evil He employed a strict frugality in the management and distribution of his revenue He engaged the parliament to vote him a fifteenth of all moveables the Pope to grant him the tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues for three years and the merchants to consent to a perpetual imposition of half a mark on every sack of wool exported and a mark on three hundred skins He also issued commissions to enquire into all encroachments on the royal demesne into the value of escheats forfeitures and wardships and into the means of repairing or improving every branch of the revenue  Ann Waverl p  The commissioners in the execution of their office began to carry matters too far against the nobility and to question the titles to estates which had been transmitted from father to son for several generations Earl Warrenne who had done such eminent service in the late reign being required to show his titles drew his sword and subjoined that William the Norman had not conquered the kingdom for himself alone his ancestor was a joint adventurer in the cause and he himself was determined to maintain what had from that period remained unquestioned in his family The King sensible of the danger very prudently desisted from making farther enquiries of this nature  Conquest of Wales  BUT the active spirit of Edward could not long remain without employment He soon after undertook an enterprize more safe for himself and more advantageous to his people Lewellyn prince of Wales had been deeply engaged with the Mounfort faction had entered into all their conspiracies against the crown had frequently fought on their side and till the battle of Evesham so fatal to that party had employed every expedient to depress the royal cause and to promote the success of the barons In the general accommodation made with the vanquished  Lewellyn had also obtained his pardon but as he was the most powerful and therefore the most obnoxious vassal of the crown he had reason to entertain anxiety about his situation and to dread the future effects of resentment and jealousy in the English monarchs For this reason he had determined to provide for his security by maintaining a secret correspondence with his former associates and he even made his addresses to a daughter of the earl of Leicester who was sent to him from beyond sea but being intercepted in her passage near the isles of Scilly was detained in the court of England  Walsin p Heming vol p Trivet p  This incident encreasing the mutual jealousy between Edward and Lewellyn the latter when required to come to England and do homage to the new King scrupled to put himself into the hands of an enemy desired a safe conduct from Edward insisted upon having the King's son and other noblemen delivered to him as hostages and demanded that his spouse should be previously set at liberty  Rymer vol p Walsin p Trivet p  The King having now brought the state to a full settlement was not displeased with this occasion of exercising his authority and subduing entirely the principality of Wales He refused all Lewellyn's demands except that of a safe conduct sent him repeated summons to perform the duty of a vassal levied an army to reduce him to obedience obtained a new aid of a fifteenth from parliament and marched out with certain assurance of success against the enemy  Besides the great disproportion of force between the kingdom and principality the circumstances of the two slates were now entirely reversed and the same intestine dissentions which had formerly weakened England now prevailed in Wales and had even taken place in the reigning family David and Roderic brothers to Lewellyn had been dispossessed of their inheritance by that prince had been obliged to have recourse to the protection of Edward and seconded with all their interest which was extensive his attempts to enslave their native country The Welsh prince had no other resource but in the inaccessible situation of his mountains which had hitherto thro' many ages defended his forefathers against all the attempts of the Saxon and Norman conquerors and he retired among the hills of Snowdun resolute to defend himself to the last extremity But Edward equally vigorous and cautious entering by the north with a formidable army pierced into the heart of the country and having carefully explored every road before him and secured every pass behind him approached the Welsh army in its last retreat He here avoided the putting to trial the valour of a nation proud of its antient independance and enflamed with animosity against its hereditary enemies and he trusted to the slow but sure effects of famine for reducing that people to  subjection The rude and simple manners of the natives as well as the mountainous situation of their country had made them entirely neglect tillage and trust to pasturage alone for their subsistance A method of life which had hitherto secured them against the irregular attempts of the English but exposed them to certain ruin when the conquest of the country was steddily pursued and prudently planned by Edward Destitute of magazines cooped up in a narrow corner they and their cattle suffered equally from famine and Lewellyn without being able to strike a stroke for his independance was at last obliged to submit at discretion and receive the terms imposed upon him by the victor  T Wykes p    th Nov  He bound himself to pay to Edward l as reparation of damages to do homage to the crown of England to permit all the other barons of Wales except four near Snowdun to swear fealty to the same crown to relinquish the country between Cheshire and the river Conway to settle on his brother Roderic a thousand marks a year and on David five hundred and to deliver ten hostages for security of his future submission  Rymer vol p Walsin p Trivet p T Wykes p    EDWARD on the performance of the other articles remitted to the prince of Wales the payment of the l  Rymer p  which were stipulated by treaty and which it is probable the poverty of the country made it absolutely impossible for him to levy But complaints of other hardships soon arose on the side of the vanquished The English insolent on their easy and bloodless victory oppressed the inhabitants of the districts which were yielded to them The lords marchers committed with impunity all kinds of violence on their Welsh neighbours New and more severe terms were imposed on Lewellyn himself and Edward when the prince attended him at Worcester exacted a promise that he would retain no person in his principality who should be disagreeable to the English monarch  Dr Powell's Hist of Wales p  There were other personal insults which raised the indignation of the Welsh and made them determine rather to encounter a force which they had already experienced to be so much superior than to bear any longer the oppression of the haughty victors Prince David seized with the national spirit made peace with his brother and promised to concur in the defence of public liberty The Welsh flew to arms and Edward not displeased with the occasion of making his conquest final and absolute summoned together all his military tenants and advanced into Wales with an army which the inhabitants could not reasonably hope to resist The situation of the country gave the Welsh at first some advantage over Luke de Tany one of Edward's captains who had passed the Menau  with a detachment  Walsin p Heming vol p Trivet p T Wykes p    But Lewellen being surprized by Mortimer was defeated and slain in the action and of his followers put to the sword  Heming vol p Trivet p Ann Waverl p  David who succeeded him in the principality could never collect an army sufficient to face the English and being chaced from hill to hill and hunted from one retreat to another was obliged to conceal himself under various disguises and was at last betrayed in his lurkingplace to the enemy Edward sent him in chains to Shrewsbury  and bringing him to a formal trial before all the peers of England ordered this sovereign prince to be hanged drawn and quartered as a traitor for defending by arms the liberties of his native country together with his own hereditary authority  Heming vol p Trivet p Ann Waverl p T Wykes p M West p  All the Welsh nobility submitted to the conqueror the laws of England with the sheriffs and other ministers of justice were established in that principality and tho' it was long before national antipathies were extinguished and a thorough union accomplished between the people yet this important conquest which it had required eight hundred years fully to effectuate was at last thro' the abilities of Edward compleated by the English  THE King sensible that nothing kept alive the ideas of military valour and of ancient glory so much as the traditional poetry of the people which assisted by the power of music and the jollity of festivals made deep impression on the mind of the youth gathered together all the Welsh bards and from a barbarous tho' not absurd policy ordered them to be put to death  Sir J Wynne p    THERE prevails a vulgar story which as it suits exactly the capacity of the monkish writers is carefully recorded by them That Edward assembling the Welsh promised to give them a prince of unexceptionable manners a Welshman by birth and one who could speak no other language On their acclamations of joy and promise of obedience he invested in the principality his second son Edward then an infant who had been born at Carnarvon The death of his eldest son Alfonso soon after made young Edward heir of the monarchy The principality of Wales was fully annexed to the crown and henceforth gives a title to the eldest son of the kings of England  THE settlement of Wales appeared so complete to Edward that in less than two years after he went abroad in order to make peace between Alphonso King of Arragon and Philip le Bel who had newly succeeded his father Philip le Hardy in the throne of France  Rymer vol p  The difference between these two princes had  arisen about the kingdom of Sicily which the Pope after his hopes from England failed him had bestowed on Charles brother to St Lewis and which was claimed upon other tit es by Peter King of Arragon father to Alphonso Edward had powers from both princes to settle the peace and he succeeded in his endeavours but as the controversy no wise regards England we shall not enter into a detail of it He stayed abroad above three years and on his return found many disorders to have prevailed both from open violence and from the corruption of justice  THOMAS CHAMBERLAIN a gentleman of some note had assembled several of his associates at Boston in Lincolnshire under pretence of holding a tournament an exercise practised by the gentry only but in reality with a view of plundering the rich fair of Boston and robbing the merchants To facilitate his purpose he privately set fire to the town and while the inhabitants were employed in quenching the flames the conspirators broke into the booths and carried off the goods Chamberlain himself was detected and hanged but maintained so steddily the point of honour to his accomplices that he could not be prevailed with either by money or promises to discover any of them Many other instances of robbery and violence broke out in all parts of England tho' the singular circumstances attending this conspiracy have made it alone be particularly recorded by historians  Heming vol p    BUT the corruption of the judges by which the fountains of justice were poisoned seemed still of more dangerous consequence Edward in order to remedy this prevailing abuse summoned a parliament and brought the judges to a trial where all of them except two who were clergymen were convicted of this flagrant iniquity were fined and deposed from their office The amount of the fines levied upon them is alone a sufficient proof of their guilt being above one hundred thousand marks an immense sum in those days and sufficient to defray the charges of an expensive war between two great kingdoms The King afterwards made all the new judges swear that they would take no bribes but his expedient of deposing and fining the old ones was the more effectual remedy  WE come now to give an account of the affairs of Scotland which form the most interesting transaction of this reign and of some of the subsequent tho' the intercourse of that kingdom with England either in peace or war had hitherto produced so few events of moment that to avoid tediousness we have omitted many of them and have been very concise in relating the rest If the  Scots had before this period any real history worthy of the name except what they pick up from scattered passages of the English historians these events however minute yet being the only foreign transactions of the nation might deserve a place in it  Affairs of Scotland  THO' the government of Scotland had been continually exposed to those factions and convulsions which are incident to all barbarous and to many civilized nations and tho' the successions of their Kings the only part of their history which deserves any credit had been often disordered by irregularities and usurpations the true heir of the royal family had still in the end prevailed and Alexander III who had espoused Edward's sister probably inherited after a period of above eight hundred years and thro' a succession of males the scepter of all the Scottish princes who had governed the nation since its first establishment in the island This prince died in by a fall from his horse at Kinghorn  Heming vol p Trevet p  without leaving any male issue and without any descendants except Margaret born of Eric King of Norway and of Margaret daughter of the Scottish monarch This princess commonly called the maid of Norway tho' a female and an infant and a foreigner yet being the lawful heir of the kingdom had thro' her grandfather's care been recognized successor by the states of Scotland  Rymer vol p  and on Alexander's death the dispositions which had been previously made against that event appeared so just and prudent that no disorders as might naturally be apprehended ensued in the kingdom Margaret was acknowledged queen of Scotland five Guardians the bishops of St Andrews and Glasgow the earls of Fife and Buchan and James steward of Scotland entered peaceably upon the administration and the infant princess under the protection of Edward her great uncle and Eric her father who exerted themselves on this occasion seemed firmly seated on the throne of Scotland The English monarch was naturally engaged to build mighty projects on this event and having lately by force of arms brought Wales under subjection he attempted by the marriage of Margaret with his eldest son Edward to unite the whole island into one monarchy and thereby to give it full security both against domestic convulsions and foreign invasions  The amity which had of late prevailed between the two nations and which even in former times had never been interrupted by any violent wars or injuries facilitated extremely the execution of this project so favourable to the happiness and grandeur of both kingdoms and the states of Scotland readily gave their assent to the English proposals and even agreed that their young sovereign should be educated in the court of Edward Anxious however for the liberty and independancy of their country they took care to stipulate very  equitable conditions ere they entrusted themselves into the hands of so great and so ambitious a monarch that they should enjoy all their antient laws liberties and customs that in case young Edward and Margaret should die without issue the crown of Scotland should revert to the next heirs and should be inherited by them free and independent that the military tenants of the crown should never be obliged to go out of Scotland in order to do homage to the sovereign of the united kingdoms nor the chapters of cathedral collegiate or conventual churches in order to make elections that the parliaments summoned for Scots affairs should always be held within the bounds of that kingdom and that Edward should bind himself under the penalty of marks payable to the Pope for the use of the holy wars to observe all these articles  Rymer vol p  It is not easy to conceive that two nations could have treated more on a footing of equality than Scotland and England maintained during the course of this whole transaction And tho' Edward gave his assent to the article concerning the future independancy of the Scottish crown with a  saving of his former rights  this reserve gave no alarm to the nobility of Scotland both because these rights having been hitherto little heard of had occasioned no disturbance and because the Scots had so near a prospect of seeing them entirely absorbed in the rights of their sovereignty  BUT this project so happily formed and so amicably conducted failed of success by the sudden death of the Norvegian princess who expired on her passage to Scotland  Heming vol p Trevet p  and left a very dismal prospect to the kingdom  Competitors  the crown of Scotland  Tho' disorders were for the present obviated by the authority of the regency formerly established the succession of the crown itself was now become an object of dispute and the regents could not expect that a controversy which is not usually decided by reason and argument alone would be peaceably settled by them or even by the states of the kingdom amidst so many powerful pretenders The posterity of William King of Scotland the prince who was taken prisoner by Henry II being all extinct by the death of Margaret of Norway the right to the crown was devolved on the line of David earl of Huntington brother to William whose male line being also extinct left the succession open to the posterity of his daughters The earl of Huntington had three daughters Margaret married to Alan lord of Galloway Isabella wife of Robert Brus or Bruce lord of Annandale and Adama who espoused Henry lord Hastings Margaret the eldest of the three sisters left one daughter Devergilda married to John Baliol by whom she had a son of the same name one of the present candidates for the crown Isabella II bore a son Robert Bruce who was now alive and also insisted on his  claim Adama III left a son John Hastings who pretended that the kingdom of Scotland like many other inheritances was divisible among the three daughters of the earl of Huntington and that he in the right of his mother had a title to the third of it Baliol and Bruce united against Hastings in maintaining that the succession to the crown was impartible but each of them supported by plausible reasons asserted the preference of his own title Baliol was sprung from the elder branch Bruce was one degree nearer the common stock If the right of representation was regarded the former had the better claim If propinquity was considered the latter was entitled to the preference  Heming vol p  The sentiments of men were divided All the nobility had taken party with one side or the other The people followed implicitely their leaders The two candidates themselves had great power and numerous retainers in Scotland And it is no wonder that among a rude people more accustomed to arms than enured to laws a controversy of this nature which could not be decided by any former precedent among them and which is capable of exciting commotions in the most legal and best established governments should threaten the state with the most fatal convulsions  EACH age has its peculiar mode in conducting business and men guided more by custom than by reason follow without enquiry the manners which are prevalent in their own time The present practice in the controversies between states and princes seems to have been to choose a foreign prince as an equal arbiter by whom the question was decided and whose sentence prevented those dismal confusions and disorders inseparable at all times from war but which were multiplied an hundred fold and disperfed into every corner by the nature of the feudal governments It was thus that the English king and barons in the forgoing reign had endeavoured to compose their domestic dissensions by a reference to the King of France and the celebrated integrity of that monarch had prevented all the bad effects which might naturally have been dreaded from so perilous an expedient It was thus that the kings of France and Arragon and afterwards other princes had submitted their controversies to Edward's judgment and the remoteness of their states the great power of the princes and the little interest which he had on either side had induced him to acquit himself with honour in his decisions  Reference to Edward  The parliament of Scotland therefore threatened with a furious civil war and allured by the great reputation of the English monarch as well as by the present amicable correspondence between the kingdoms agreed in making a reference to Edward and Fraser bishop of St Andrews with other deputies was sent to notify to him their resolution and to claim his  good offices in the present dangers to which they were exposed  Heming vol p  His inclination they flattered themselves led him to prevent their dissensions and to interpose with a power which none of the candidates would dare to withstand When this expedient was proposed by one party the other deemed it dangerous to object to it Indifferent persons thought that the imminent perils of a civil war would thereby be prevented And no one reflected on the ambitious character of Edward and the almost certain ruin which must attend a small state divided by factions when it thus implicitely submits itself to the will of so powerful and encroaching a neighbour  THE temptation was too strong for the virtue of the English monarch to resist He proposed to lay hold of the present favourable opportunity and if not to create at least to revive his claim of a feudal superiority over Scotland a claim which had hitherto lain in the deepest obscurity and which if ever it had been an object of attention or had been so much as suspected would have effectually prevented the Scottish barons from choosing him for an arbiter He well knew that if this pretension was once submitted to as it seemed difficult in the present situation of Scotland to oppose it the absolute sovereignty of that kingdom which had been the case with Wales would soon follow and that one great vassal cooped up in an island with his liege lord without resource from foreign powers without aid from any fellow vassals could not long maintain his dominions against the efforts of a mighty kingdom assisted by all the cavils which the feudal law afforded his superior against him In pursuit of this great object very advantageous to England perhaps in the end no less beneficial to Scotland but extremely unjust and iniquitous in itself Edward busied himself in searching for proofs of his pretended superiority and instead of looking into his own archives which if his claim had been real must have afforded him numerous records of the homages paid by the Scottish princes and could alone yield him any authentic testimony he made all the monasteries be ransacked for old chronicles and histories wrote by Englishmen and he collected all the passages which seemed any wise to favour his pretensions  Walsing p  Yet even in this method of proceeding which must have discovered to himself the injustice of his claim he was far from being fortunate He began his proofs from the time of Edward the elder and continued them thro' all the Saxon and Norman times but produced nothing to his purpose  Rymer vol p  The whole amount of his authorities during the Saxon period when stripped of the bombast and inaccurate style of the monks is that the Scots had sometimes been defeated by the English had  received peace on disadvantageous terms had made submissions to the English monarch and had even perhaps fallen into some dependance on a power which was so much superior and which they had not at that time sufficient force to resist His authorities from the Norman period were if possible still less conclusive The historians indeed make frequent mention of an homage paid by the northern potentate but no one of them says that it was done for his kingdom and several of them declare in express terms that it was relative only to the fiefs which he enjoyed south of the Tweed  Hoveden p M Paris p M Westm p  in the same manner as the King of England himself swore fealty to the French monarch for the fiefs which he inherited in France And to such scandalous shifts was Edward reduced that he quotes a passage from Hoveden  P  where it is asserted that a Scottish King had done homage to England but he purposely omits the latter part of the fame sentence which expresses that this prince did homage for the lands which he held in England  WHEN William King of Scotland was taken prisoner in the battle of Alnwic he was obliged for the recovery of his liberty to swear fealty to the victor for his crown itself The deed was performed according to all the rites of the feudal law The record was preserved in the English archives as well as mentioned by all the historians But as it is the only one of the kind and as historians speak of this superiority as a great acquisition gained by the fortunate arms of Henry II  Neubr lib cap Knyghton p  there can remain no doubt that the kingdom of Scotland was in all former periods entirely free and independent Its subjection continued a very few years King Richard desirous before his departure for the Holy Land to conciliate the friendship of William renounced that homage which he says in express terms had been  extorted  by his father and he only retained the usual homage which had been done by the Scottish princes for the lands which they held in England  BUT tho' this transaction rendered the independance of Scotland still more unquestionable than if no fealty had ever been sworn to the English crown the Scottish Kings apprized of the point aimed at by their powerful neighbours seem for a long time to have retained some jealousy on that head and in doing homage to have anxiously obviated all such pretensions When William in did homage to John at Lincoln he was careful to insert a salvo for his royal dignity  Hoveden p  When Alexander III sent assistance to his father in law Henry III during the barons wars he previously procured an acknowledgment that this aid  was only granted from friendship not from any right claimed by the English monarch  Rymer vol p  And when the same prince was invited to assist at the coronation of this very Edward he declined attendance till he received a like acknowledgment  Rymer vol p There cannot be the least question that the homage usually paid by the kings of Scotland was not for their crown but for some other territory The only question remains what that territory was It was not always for the earldom of Huntington nor the honour of Penryth because we find it sometimes done at a time when these possessions were not in the hands of the kings of Scotland It is probable that the homage was performed in general terms without any particular specification of territory and this inaccuracy had proceeded either from some dispute between the two kings about the territory and some opposite claims which were compromised by the general homage or from the fimplicity of the age which employed few words in every transaction To prove this we need but look into the letter of King Richard where he resigns the homage of Scotland reserving the usual homage His words are  Saepedictus W Rex ligius homo noster deveniat de omnibus terris de quibus antecessores sui antecessorum nostrorum ligii homenes fuerunt et nobis atque baeredibus nostris fideletatem jurarunt  Rymer vol p These general terms were probably copied from the usual form of the homage itself  It is no proof that the kings of Scotland possessed no lands nor baronies in England because we cannot find them in the imperfect histories and records of that age For instance it appears clearly from another passage of this very letter of Richard that the Scottish King had lands both in the county of Huntington and elsewhere in England tho' the earldom of Huntington itself was then in the person of his brother David and we know at present of no other baronies which William held It cannot be expected that we should now be able to specify all his fees which he either possessed or claimed in England when it is probable that the two monarchs themselves and their ministers would at that very time have differed in the list The Scottish King might possess some to which his right was disputed he might claim others which he did not possess And neither of the kings was willing to resign his pretensions by a particular enumeration  A late author of great industry and learning but full of prejudices and of no penetration Mr Carte has taken advantage of the undefined terms of the Scots homage and has pretended that it was done for Lothian and Galloway that is all the territories of the country now called Scotland lying south of the Clyde and Forth But to refute this pretension at once we need only consider that if these territories were held in see of the English Kings there would by the nature of the feudal law us established in England have been continual appeals from them to the courts of the lord Paramont contrary to all the histories and records of that age We find that as soon as Edward really established his superiority appeals immediately commenced from all parts of Scotland And that King in his writ to the king's bench confiders them as a necessary consequence of the feudal tenure Such large territories also would have supplied a confiderable part of the English armies which never could have escaped all the historians Not to mention that there is not any instance of a Scots prisoner of war being tried as a rebel in the many hostilities between the kingdoms where the Scots armies were chiefly filed from the southern counties  MR Carte's notion with regard to Galloway which comprehends in the language of that age or rather in that of the preceding most of the south west counties of Scotland his notion I say rests on so slight a foundation that it scarce merits being refuted He will have it and merely because he will have it that the Cumberland yielded by King Edmund to Malcolm I meant not only the county in England of that name but all the territory northwards to the Clyde But the case of Lothian deserves some more consideration  IT is certain that in very antient language Scotland means only the country north of the firths of Clyde and Forth I shall not make a parade of literature to prove it because I do not find that this point is disputed by the Scots themselves The southern country was divided into Galloway and Lothian and the latter comprehended all the south east counties This territory was certainly a part of the antient kingdom of Northumberland and was entirely peopled by Saxons who afterwards received a great mixture of Danes among them It appears from all the English histories that the whole kingdom of Northumberland paid very little obedience to the Saxon monarchs who governed after the dissolution of the heptarchy and the northern and remote parts of it seem to have fallen into a kind of anarchy sometimes pillaged by the Danes and sometimes concurring with them in their ravages upon other parts of England The kings of Scotland lying nearer them took at last possession of the country which had scarce any government and we are told by Matthew of Westminster p that King Edgar made a grant of the territory to Kenneth III that is he resigned claims which he could not make effectual without bestowing on them more trouble and expence than they were worth For these are the only grants of provinces made by kings and so ambitious and active a prince as Edgar would never have given presents of any other kind Tho' Matthew of Westminster's authority may appear small with regard to so remote a transaction yet we may admit it in this case because Ordericus Vitalis a very good authority tells us p that Malcolm acknowledged to William Rufus that the conqueror had confirmed to him the former grant of Lothian But it follows not because Edgar made this species of grant to Kenneth that therefore he exacted homage for that territory Homage and the whole rites of the feudal law were very little known to the Saxons and we may also suppose that the claim of Edgar was so antiquated and weak that in resigning it he made no very valuable concession and Kenneth might well refuse to hold by so precarious a tenure a territory which he at present held by the sword In short no author says he did homage for it  THE only colour indeed of authority for Mr Carte's notion is that Matthew Paris who wrote in the reign of Henry III before Edward's claim of superiority was heard of says that Alexander III did homage to Henry III  pro Laudiano et aliis terris  See page This word seems naturally to be interpreted Lothian But in the first place Matthew Paris's testimony tho' considerable will not outweigh that of all the other historians who say that the Scots homage was always done for lands in England Secondly if the Scots homage was done in general terms as has been already proved it is no wonder that historians should differ in their account of the object of it since the parties themselves were not fully agreed Thirdly there is reason to think that  Laudianum  in Matthew Paris does not mean Lothian in Scotland There appears to have been a territory which antiently bore that or a similar name in the north of England For The Saxon Chronicle p says that Malcolm Kenmure met William Rufus in Lodene in England It is agreed by all the historians that Henry II only reconquered from Scotland the northern counties of Northumberland Cumberland and Westmorland See Newbriggs p Wykes p Hemingford p Yet the same country is called by other historians Loidis comitatus Lodonensis or some such name See M Paris p M West p Annal Waverl p and Diceto p This last mentioned author when he speaks of Lothian in Scotland calls it Loheneis p tho' he had called the English territory Lo dis King David's charter to the church of Durham begins with this passage  Omnibus Scotis Anglis tam in Scotia quam in Ledoneis constitutes  c See Spellman Gloss in verbo Scotia Whence we may learn that the province of  Ledoneium  was not only situated south of the Tweed but also extended beyond Durham and made a part of England  I thought this long note requisite in order to correct Mr Carte's mistake an author whose diligence and industry has given light to many passages of the more antient English history    BUT as all these reasons and stronger could not be produced were but a feeble rampart against the power of the sword Edward carrying with him a great army  which was to enforce his proofs advanced to the frontiers and invited the Scots pa liament and a l the competitors to attend him in the castle of Norham a place situated on the southern banks of the Tweed in order to determine that cause which had been referred to his arbitration But tho' this deference seemed due to so great a monarch and was no more than what his father and the English barons had in similar circumstances paid to Lewis IX the King careful not to give umbrage and determined never to produce his claim till it should be too late to think of opposition sent the Scottish barons an acknowledgement that tho' at this time they passed the frontiers such a step should never be drawn into precedent nor afford the English kings a pretence for exacting a like submission in any future transactions  Rymer vol p  Walsing p      th May  When the whole Scottish nation had thus unwarily put themselves in his power Edward opened the conferences at Norham and informed the parliament by the mouth of Roger le Brabançon his chief justiciary that he was come thither to determine the right among the competitors to their crown that he was determined to do strict justice to all parties and that he was intitled to this authority not in virtue of the reference made to him but in the quality of superior and liege lord of the kingdom  Rymer vol p It is remarkable that the English chancellor spoke to the Scots parliament in the French tongue This was also the language commonly made use of by all parties on that occasion Ibid passim The most considerable of the Scots as well as almost all the English barons were of French dragin they valued themselves upon it and pretended to despise the language and manners of the island It is difficult to account for the settlement of so many French families in Scotland the Bruces Baliols St Clairs Somervilles Gordons Frasers Cummins Colvilles Umfrevilles Mowbrays Hays Maules who were not supported there as in England by the power of the sword But the superiority of civility and knowledge however small over total ignorance and barbarism is prodigious  He then produced his proofs of this superiority which he pretended to be unquestionable and he required of them an acknowledgment of it a demand which was superfluous if the fact was already known and avowed and which plainly betrays Edward's consciousness of his lame and defective title The Scots parliament were astonished at so new a pretension and answered only by their silence But the King in order to maintain the appearance of free and regular proceedings  desired them to remove into their own country to deliberate upon his claim to examine his proofs to propose all their objections and then to inform him of their resolutions And he appointed a plain at Upsetleton on the northern banks of the Tweed for that purpose  WHEN the Scottish barons assembled in this place tho' moved with indignation at the injustice of this unexpected claim and at the fraud with which it had been conducted they found themselves betrayed into a situation in which it was impossible for them to make any defence for the ancient liberty and independance of their country The King of England a martial and politic prince at the head of a powerful army lay at a very small distance and was only separated from them by a river fordable in many places Tho' by a sudden flight some of them might themselves be able to make their escape what hopes could they entertain of securing the kingdom against his future enterprizes Without a head without union among themselves attached all of them to different competitors whose title they had rashly submitted to the decision of this foreign usurper and who were thereby reduced to an absolute dependance upon him they could only expect by resistance to entail on themselves and their posterity a more grievous and more destructive servitude Yet even in this desperate state of their affairs the Scottish barons as we learn from Walsingham  Page M West p It is said by Hemingford vol p that the King menaced violently the Scots barons and forced them to compliance at least to silence  one of the best historians of that period had the courage to reply that till they had a King they could take no resolution on so momentuous a point The journal of King Edward says that they made no answer at all  Rymer vol p  That is perhaps no  particular  answer or objection to Edward's claim And by this solution it is possible to reconcile the journal with the historian The King therefore interpreting their silence as a consent addressed himself to the several competitors and previously to his pronouncing sentence required their acknowledgement of his superiority  IT is evident from the genealogy of the royal family of Scotland that there could only be two questions about the succession that between Baliol and Bruce on the one hand and lord Hastings on the other concerning the partition of the crown and that between Baliol and Bruce themselves concerning the preference of their respective titles supposing the kingdom indivisible Yet there appeared on this occasion no less than nine claimants besides who challenged the crown John Comyn or Cummin Lord of Badenoch Florence earl of Holland Patrick Dunbar earl of March William de Vescey Robert de Pynkeni Nicholas de Soules Patrick Galythly Roger de Mandeville Robert de Ross not to mention the  King of Norway who claimed as heir to his daughter Margaret  Walsin p  Some of these competitors were descended from more remote branches of the royal family others were even sprung from illegitimate children and as none of them had the least pretence of right it is natural to conjecture that Edward had secretly encouraged them to appear in the list of claimants that he might sow the more divisions among the Scottish nobility make the cause appear the more intricate and be able to choose among a great number the most obsequious candidate  BUT he found them all equally obsequious on this occasion  Rymer vol p Walsin p Heming vol p Trivet p M West p  Robert Bruce was the first who acknowledged Edward's right of superiority over Scotland and he had so far foreseen the King's pretensions that even in his petition where he set forth his claim to the crown he had previously applied to him as liegelord of the kingdom a step which was not taken by any of the other candidates  Rymer vol p  They all however with seeming willingness made a like acknowledgement when required tho' Baliol lest he should give offence to the Scots nation had taken care to be absent during the first days and he was the last who recognized the King's title  Rymer vol p  Edward next deliberated concerning the method of proceeding in the discussion of this great controversy He appointed that Baliol and such of the candidates as adhered to him should choose forty commissioners Bruce and his adherents other forty To these the King added twentyfour Englishmen And he ordered these hundred and four commissioners to examine the cause deliberately among themselves and make their report to him  Rymer vol p  And he promised in the ensuing year to give his determination Mean while he pretended that it was requisite to have all the fortresses of Scotland delivered into his hands in order to enable him without opposition to put the true heir in possession of the crown and this exorbitant demand was complied with both by the states and the candidates  Rymer vol p Walsin p  The governors also of all the castles immediately resigned their command except Umfreville earl of Angus who refused without a formal acquittal from the parliament and the several claimants to surrender his fortresses to such a domineering arbiter who had given to Scotland so many just reasons of suspicion  Rymer vol p  Before this assembly had broke up which had fixed such a mark of dishonour on the nation all the prelates and barons there present swore fealty to Edward and that prince appointed commissioners to take a like oath of all the other barons and persons of distinction in Scotland  Rymer vol p    THE King having finally made as he imagined this important acquisition left the commissioners to sit at Berwick and examine the titles of the several candidates who claimed the precarious crown which Edward was willing for some time to allow the lawful heir to enjoy He went southwards both in order to assist at the funerals of his mother Queen Eleanor who died about this time and to compose some differences which had arisen among his principal nobility Gilbert earl of Glocester the greatest baron of the kingdom had espoused the King's daughter and being elated by that alliance and still more by his own exorbitant power which he thought set him above the laws he permitted his bailiffs and vassals to commit violences on the lands of Humphrey Bohun earl of Hereford who retaliated the injury by like violences But this was not a reign in which such illegal proceedings could pass with impunity Edward procured a sentence against the two earls committed them both to prison and would not restore them to their liberty till he exacted a fine of merks from Hereford and one of from his soninlaw  DURING this interval the titles of John Baliol and of Robert Bruce whose claims appeared to be the best founded among the competitors to the crown of Scotland were the subject of general disquisition as well as of debate among the commissioners Edward in order to give greater authority to his intended decision proposed this general question both to the assembly and to all the celebrated lawyers in Europe Whether a person descended from the eldest sister but farther removed by one degree was preferable in the succession of kingdoms fiefs and other impartible inheritances to one descended from the younger sister but one degree nearer the common stock This was the true state of the case and the right of representation had now gained such ground every where that an uniform answer was returned to the King in the affirmative He therefore pronounced sentence in favour of Baliol  Award of Edward in favour of Baliol  and when Bruce upon this disappointment joined afterwards lord Hastings and claimed a third of the kingdom which he now pretended to be divisible Edward tho' the interests of his ambition seemed more to require the partition of Scotland again pronounced sentence in favour of Baliol That candidate upon renewing his oath of fealty to England was put in possession of the kingdom  Rymer vol p  all his fortresses were restored to him  Rymer vol p  and the conduct of Edward both in the deliberate solemnity of the proceedings and in the justice of his award was so far unexceptionable  HAD the King entertained no other view than that of establishing his superiority over Scotland tho' the iniquity of that claim was apparent and was aggravated  by the most egregious brea h of trust he might have fixed his pretensions and have left that important acquisition to his posterity But he immediately proceeded in such a manner as made it apparent that not contented with this usurpation he aimed also at the absolute sovereignty and dominion of the kingdom Instead of gradually enuring the Scots to bear the yoke and exerting his rights of superiority with moderation he encouraged all appeals to England required King John himself by six different summons on trivial occasions to come to London  Rymer vol p  refused him the privilege of defending his cause by a procurator and obliged him to appear at the bar of his parliament as a private person  Ryley's Placit Parl p  These humiliating demands were hitherto quite unknown to a King of Scotland They are however the necessary consequences of vassalage by the feudal law and as there was no preceding instance of such treatment submitted to by a prince of that country Edward must from that circumstance alone had there remained any doubt have been himself convinced that his claim was altogether an usurpation  See Rymer vol p where Edward writes to the King's Bench to r ceive appeals from Scotland He knew the practice to be unusual yet he establishes it as an infallible consequence of his superiority We learn also from the same book p that immediately upon receiving the homage he changed the style of his address to the Scots King whom he now calls  dilecto fideli  infiead of  fratri dilecto fideli  the appellation which he had always before used to him see p This is a certain proof that he himself was not deceived as was scarce indeed possible but that he was conscious of his usurpation Yet he solemnly swore afterwards to the justice of his pretensions when he defended them before Pope Boniface  But his intention plainly was to enrage Baliol by these indignities to engage him in rebellion and to assume the dominion of the state as the punishment of his treason and felony Accordingly Baliol tho' a prince of a soft and gentle spirit returned into Scotland highly provoked at this usage and determined at all hazards to vindicate his liberty and the war which soon after broke out between France and England gave him a favourable opportunity for executing his purpose  THE violences robberies and disorders to which that age was so subject were not confined to the licentious barons and their retainers at land The sea was equally infested with pyracy The weak execution of the laws had given licence to all orders of men And a general appetite for rapine and revenge supported by a false point of honour had also infected the merchants and mariners and pushed them on any provocation to seek redress by immediate retaliation upon the aggressors  War with France  A Norman and English ship met off the coast near Bayonne and having both occasion for fresh water they sent their boats to land and the several crews came at the same time to the same spring There ensued  a quarrel for the preference A Norman drawing his dagger attempted to stab an Englishman who grappling with him threw his adversary on the ground and the Norman as was pretended falling on his own dagger was slain  Walsin p Heming vol p  This scuffle between two seamen about water kindled soon a bloody war between the two nations and involved a great part of Europe in the quarrel The mariners of the Norman ship carried their complaints to the French King Philip without enquiring into the truth without asking for redress bid them take revenge and trouble him no more about the matter  Walsin p  The Normans who had been more regular than usual in applying to the crown needed but this hint to proceed to immediate violence They seized an English ship in the channel and hanging along with some dogs several of the crew on the yardarm in presence of their companions dismissed the vessel  Heming vol p M West p  and bad the mariners inform their countrymen that vengeance was now taken for the blood of the Norman killed at Bayonne This injury accompanied by so general and deliberate an insult was resented by the mariners of the cinque ports who without carrying any complaints to the King or waiting for redress retaliated by committing like barbarities on all French vessels without distinction The French provoked by their losses preyed on the ships of all Edward's subjects whether English or Gascon The sea became a scene of pyracy between the nations The sovereigns without either seconding or repressing the violence of their subjects seemed to continue indifferent spectators The English made private associations with the Irish and Dutch seamen the French with the Flemish and Genoese  Heming vol p  And the animosities of the people on both sides became every day more violent and barbarous A fleet of two hundred Norman vessels set sail to the south for wine and other commodities and in their passage seized all the English ships which they met with hanged the seamen and seized the goods The inhabitants of the English sea ports informed of this event fitted out a fleet of sixty sail stronger and better manned than the others and awaited the enemy on their return After an obstinate battle they put them to rout and sunk destroyed or took the greatest part of them  Walsin p Trivet p Chron Dunst vol p  No quarter was given and it is pretended that the loss of the French on this occasion amounted to men Which is accounted for by this circumstance that the Norman fleet was employed in transporting a considerable body of soldiers from the south  THE affair was now become too important to be any longer overlooked by the princes On Philip's sending an envoy to demand reparation and restitution the  King di patched the bishop of London to the French court in order to accomdate the quarrel He first said that the English courts of justice were open to all men and if any Frenchman were injured he might seek reparation by course of law  Trivet p    He next offered to adjust the matter by private arbitrators or by personal interview with the King of France or by a reference either to the Pope or the college of cardinals or any particular cardinals agreed on by both parties  Trivet p    The French probably the more disgusted as they were hitherto losers in the quarrel refused all these expedients The vessels and the goods of merchants were confiscated on both sides Depredations were continued by the Gascons on all the western coasts of France as well as by the English in the channel Philip cited the King as duke of Guienne to appear in his court at Paris and answer for these offences And Edward apprehensive of danger to that province sent John St John an experienced soldier to Bourdeaux and gave him directions to put Guienne in a posture of defence  Trivet p    THAT he might however prevent a final rupture between the nations the King dispatched his brother Edmond earl of Lancaster to Paris and as that prince had espoused the Queen of Navarre mother to Jane Queen of France he seemed on account of that alliance the most proper person for finding expedients to accommodate the difference Jane pretended to interpose with her good offices Mary the Queendowager seigned the same amicable disposition And these two princesses told Edmond that the circumstance the most difficult to adjust was the point of honour with Philip who thought himself affronted by the injuries committed against him by his subvassals in Guienne But if once Edward would consent to give him seizin and possession of that province he would think his honour fully repaired and engage to restore it immediately and would accept of a very easy satisfaction for all the other injuries The King was consulted on this occasion and as he then found himself in immediate danger of war with the Scots which he regarded as the more important concern this politic prince blinded by his favourite passion for subduing that nation allowed himself to be deceived by so gross an artifice  Rymer vol p  Walsin p Heming vol p Trivet p  He sent his brother orders to sign and execute the treaty with the two queens Philip solemnly promised to execute his part of it and the King's citation to appear in the court of France was accordingly recalled But the French monarch was no sooner put in possession of Guienne than the citation was renewed Edward was condemned for nonappearance and Guienne by a formal sentence was declared to be forfeited and annexed to the crown  Rymer vol p  Walsin p  Trivet p    EDWARD fallen into a like snare with that which he had spread for the Scots was inraged and the more so as he was justly ashamed of his own conduct in being so egregiously overreached by the court of France Sensible of the extreme difficulties which he would encounter in the recovery of Gascony where he had not retained a single place in his hands he endeavoured to compensate that loss by forming alliances with several European princes who he proposed should attack France on all quarters and make a diversion of her forces Adolphus de Nassau King of the Romans entered into a treaty with him for that purpose  Heming vol p  as did also Amadaeus count of Savoy the archbishop of Cologne the counts of Gueldre and Luxembourg the duke of Brabant and count of Barre who had married his two daughters Margaret and Eleanor But these alliances were extremely burdensome on his narrow revenues and proved in the issue entirely ineffectual More impression was made on Guienne by an English army which he compleated by emptying the jails of many thousand thieves and robbers who had been confined there for their crimes So low had the profession of arms fallen and so much had it degenerated from the footing on which it stood during the vigour of the seudal system  THE King himself was detained in England first by contrary winds  Chron Dunst vol p  then by his apprehensions of a Scots invasion and by a rebellion of the Welsh whom he repressed and brought again under subjection  Walsing p Heming vol p Trevet p Chron Dunst vol p  The army which he sent to Guienne was commanded by his nephew John de Bretagne earl of Richmond and under him by St John Tibetot de Vere and other officers of reputation  Trevet p  who made themselves masters of the town of Bayonne as well as of Bourg Blaye Rions St Severe and other places which straitened Bourdeaux and cut off its communication both by sea and land The favour which the Gascon nobility bore to the English government facilitated these conquests and seemed to promise still greater successes but this advantage was soon lost by the misconduct of some of the officers Philip's brother Charles de Valois who commanded the French armies having laid siege to Podensac a small fortress near Rions obliged Giffard the governor to capitulate and the articles tho' favourable to the English left all the Gascons prisoners at discretion of whom about fifty were hanged by Charles as rebels A policy by which he both intimidated that people and produced an irreparable breach between them and the English  Heming vol p  That prince immediately attacked Rions where the earl of Richmond  himself commanded and as the place seemed not very defensible the English general drew his troops to the waterside with an intention of embarking with the greatest part of the army The enraged Gascons fell upon his rear and at the same time opened their gates to the French who besides making themselves masters of the place took many prisoners of distinction St Severe was more vigorously defended by Hugh de Vere son to the earl of Oxford but was at last obliged to capitulate The French King not contented with these successes in Gascony threatened England with an invasion and by a sudden attempt his troops took and burnt Dover  Trevet p Chron Dunst vol p  but were obliged soon after to retire And in order to make a greater diversion of the English force and engage Edward in dangerous and important wars he formed a secret alliance with John Baliol King of Scotland the commencement of that strict union which during so many ages was maintained by mutual interests and necessities between the French and Scottish nations John confirmed this alliance by stipulating a marriage between his eldest son and the daughter of Philip de Valois  Rymer vol p Heming vol p Trevet p    Digression concerning the const  tuti+on of parliament  THE expences attending these multiplied wars of Edward and his preparations for war joined to alterations which had insensibly taken place in the general state of affairs obliged him to have frequent recourse to parl amentary supplies introduced the lower orders of the state into the publick councils and laid the foundations of great and important changes in the government Tho' nothing could be worse calculated for cultivating the arts of peace or maintaining peace itself than the long subordination of vassalage from the King to the meanest gentleman and the consequent slavery of the lower people evils inseparable from the feudal system that system was never able to fix the state in a proper warlike posture or give it the full exertion of its power for defence and still less for offence against a public enemy The military tenants unacquainted with obedience unexperienced in war held a rank in the troops by their birth not by their merits or services composed a very disorderly and consequently a very feeble army and during the few days which they were obliged by their tenures to remain in the field were often more formidable to their own prince than to foreign powers against whom they were assembled The sovereigns came gradually to disuse this cumbersome and dangerous machine so apt to recoil upon the hand which held it and exchanging the military service for pecuniary supplies inlisted forces by means of a contract with particular officers such as those the Italians denominate  Condottieri  whom they dismissed at the end of the war The barons and knights themselves often entered into these engagements  with the prince and were enabled to fill their bands both by the authority which they possessed over their vassals and tenants and from the great numbers of loose disorderly people whom they found on their estates and who willingly embraced an opportunity of gratifying their appetite for war and rapine Meanwhile the old Gothic fabric being neglected went gradually to decay and tho' the conqueror had divided all the lands of England into sixty thousand knight's fees the number of these was insensibly diminished by various artifices and the king at last found that by putting the law in execution he could assemble only a very small part of the antient force of the kingdom It was an usual expedient for men who held of the King or a great baron by military tenure to transfer their lands to the church and receive them back by another tenure called frankalmoigne by which they were not bound to perform any service  Madox's Baronia Anglica p  A law was made against this practice but the abuse had probably gone far before it was attended to and probably was not entirely corrected by the new statute which like most of the laws of that age we may conjecture to have been but feebly executed by the magistrate against the perpetual interests of so many individuals The constable and mareschal when they mustered the armies often in a hurry and for want of better information received the service of a baron for fewer knight's fees than were due by him and one precedent of this kind was held good against the King and became ever after a reason for diminishing the service  Madox's Baronia Anglica p  The rolls of knight's fees were very inaccurately kept no care was taken to clear them before the armies were summoned into the field  We hear only of one King Henry II who took this pains and the record called Liber niger Scaccarii was the result of it  it was then too late to think of examining records and charters and the service was accepted on the footing which the vassal himself was pleased to acknowledge after all the various subdivisions and co junctions of property had thrown an obscurity on the nature and extent of his tenure  Madox Bar Ang p  It is easy to judge of the intricacies which would attend disputes of this kind with individuals when even the number of military fees belonging to the church whose property was fixed and unalienable became the subject of controversy and we find in particular that when the bishop of Durham was charged with seventy knights fees for the aid levied to marry Henry II's daughter to the duke of Saxony the prelate acknowledged ten and disowned the other sixty  Madox Bar Ang p Hist of the Exch p  It is not known in what manner this difference was terminated but had the question been concerning an armament to defend the kingdom the bishop's service would probably have been received  without opposition for ten fees and this rate must also have fixed all his future payments Pecuniary scutages therefore diminished as much as military services  In order to pay the sum of marks as King Richard's ransom twenty shillings were imposed on each Knight's fee Had the fees remained on the original footing as settled by the conqueror this scutage would have amounted to marks which was nearly the sum required But we find that many other grievous taxes were imposed to complete it A certain proof that many frauds and abuses had prevailed in the roll of knights fees  Other methods of filling the exchequet as well as the armies must be devised New situations produced new laws and institut ons And the great alterations in the finances and military power of the crown as well as in private property were the fource of equal innovations in every part of the legislature or civil government  THE exorbitant estates conferred by the Norman on his barons and chieftains remained not long entire and unimpaired The landed property was gradualy shared out into more hands and those immense baronies were divided either by provisions to younger children by partitions among co heirs by sale or by escheating to the King who gratified a great number of his courtiers by dealing them out among them in smaller portions Such moderate estates as they required oeconomy and confined the proprietors to their own houses were better calculated for duration and the order of knights and small barons grew daily more numerous and began to form a very respectable rank or order in the state As they were all of them immediate vassals of the crown by military tenure they were from the principles of the feudal law equally intitled with the greatest barons to a seat in the national or general councils and this right tho' regarded as a privilege which the owners would not entirely relinquish was also considered as a burthen which they desired to be subjected to only on extraordinary occasions Hence it was provided in the charter of King John that while the great barons were summoned to the general council by a particular writ the small barons under which appellation the knights were also comprehended should only be called by a general summons of the sheriff The distinction between great and small barons like that between rich and poor was not exactly defined but agreeable to the inaccurate genius of that age and to the simplicity of antient government was left very much to be determined by the discretion of the King and his ministers It was usual for the prince to require by a particular summons the attendance of a baron in one parliament and to neglect him in future parliaments  Chancellor West enquiry into the manner of creating peers p  nor was this uncertainty ever complained of as an injury He attended when required He was better pleased on other occasions to be exempted from the burthen And as he was acknowledged to be of the  same order with the greatest barons it gave them no surprize to see him take his seat in the great councils whether he appeared of his own accord or by a particular summons from the King The barons from  Writ  therefore began gradually to intermix themselves with the antient barons from  Tenure  and as Cambden tells us  In Britann p  from an antient manuscript now lost that after the battle of Evesham a positive law was enacted prohibiting every baron to appear in parliament who was not invited thither by a particular summons the whole baronage of England held thenceforward their seat by writ and this important privilege of their tenures was in effect abolished Only where writs had been regularly continued for some time in one great family the omission of them would have been regarded as an affront and even as an injury  A like alteration gradually took place in the order of earls who were the highest rank of barons The dignity of an earl like that of a baron was antiently territorial and official  Spellm Gloss in voce  Comis  He exercised jurisdiction within his county He levied the third of the fines to his own profit He was at once a civil and a military magistrate And tho' his authority from the first conquest of the Normans was hereditary in England the title was so much connected with the office that where the King intended to create a new earl he had no other expedient than to erect a certain territory into a county or earldom and to bestow it upon the person and his family  Essays on British Antiquities This practice however seems to have been more familiar in Scotland and the kingdoms on the continent than in England  But as the sheriffs who were the vicegerents of the earls were named by the King and removeable at pleasure he found them more dependant upon him and endeavoured to throw the whole authority and jurisdiction of the office into their hands This magistrate was at the head of the finances and levied all the King's rents within his county He assessed at pleasure the talliages on the inhabitants in royal demesne He had usually committed to him the management of wards and often of escheats He presided in the lower courts of judicature And thus tho' inferior to the earl in dignity he was soon considered by this union of the judicial and fiscal powers and by the confidence reposed in him by the King as much superior to him in authority and undermined his influence within his own jurisdiction  There are instances of princes of the blood who accepted of the office of sheriff Spellman in voce  Vicecomis  It became usual in creating an earl to give him a fixt sallary commonly about twenty pounds a year in lieu of his third of the fines The diminution of his power kept pace with the retrenchment of his profit And the dignity of earl instead of territorial and official  dwindled into personal and titular Such were the mighty alterations which had already fully taken place or were gradually advancing in the house of peers that is in the parliament For there was antiently no other house  BUT tho' the introduction of barons by writ and of titular earls had given some encrease to the royal authority there were other causes which counterballanced those innovations and tended in a higher degree to diminish the power of the sovereign The disuse into which the feudal militia had in a great measure fallen made the barons almost entirely forget their dependence on the crown By the diminution of knights fees the King had no reasonable compensation when he levied scutages and exchanged their services for money The alienations of the crown lands had reduced him to poverty And above all the concession of the great charter had set bounds to royal authority and had rendered it more difficult and dangerous for the prince to exert any extraordinary acts of arbitrary power In this situation it was natural for the King to court the friendship of the lesser barons and knights whose influence was nowise dangerous to him and who being exposed to oppression from their powerful neighbours sought a legal protection under the shadow of the throne He desired therefore to have their presence in parliament where they served to controul the turbulent resolutions of the great To exact a regular attendance of the whole body would have produced confusion and would have imposed too heavy a burthen upon them To summon only a few by writ tho' it was practised and had a good effect served not entirely the King's purpose because these members had no farther authority than attended their personal character and were eclipsed by the appearance of the more powerful nobility He therefore dispensed with the attendance of most of the lesser barons in parliament and in return for this indulgence for such it was then esteemed required them to choose in each county a certain number of their own body whose charges they bore and who having gained the confidence carried with them of course the authority of the whole order This expedient had been practised at different times in the reign of Henry III  Rot Claus Hen III m y and d As also Rot Claus Hen III m d Prynne's pref to Cotton's Abridgement  and regularly during that of the present King The numbers sent up by each county varied at the will of the prince  Brady's answer to Petyt from the records p  They took their seat among the other peers because by their tenure they belonged to that order  Brady's Treatise of Boroughs App N  o    The introducing them into that house scarce appeared to be an innovation And tho' it was easily in the King's power by varying their number to command the resolutions of the whole parliament this circumstance was little attended to in an age when force was  more prevalent than laws and when a resolution tho' taken by the majority of a legal assembly could not be executed if it opposed the will of the more powerful minority  BUT there were other important consequences which followed the diminution and disuse of the antient feudal militia The King's expences in levying and maintaining a military force for every enterprize was encreased beyond what his narrow revenues were able to bear As the scutages of his military tenants which were accepted in lieu of their personal service had fallen to nothing there were no means of supply but from voluntary aids granted him by the parliament and church Or from the talliages which he might levy upon the towns and inhabitants in royal demesne In the former year Edward had been obliged to exact no less than the sixth of all moveables from the laity and the half of all ecclesiastical benetices  Brady of boroughs p from the records Heming vol p M West p Ryley p  for his expedition into Poictou and the suppression of the Welsh And this distressful situation which was likely often to return upon him and his successors made him think of a new device and summon up the representatives of all the boroughs to parliament This period which is the twenty third of his reign seems to be the real and true epoch of the house of commons and the first faint dawnings of popular government in England For the representatives of the counties were only deputies from the smaller barons and lesser nobility And the former precedent of representatives from the boroughs who were summoned by the earl of Leicester was regarded as the act of a violent usurpation had been discontinued in all the subsequent parliaments and if that measure had not become requisite on other accounts this example was more likely to blast than give credit to it  DURING the course of two centuries the kings of England in imitation of other European princes had embraced the salutary policy of encouraging and protecting the lower and more industrious orders of the state whom they sound well disposed to obey the laws and civil magistrate and whose ingenuity and labour furnished commodities requisite for the ornament of peace and support of war Tho' the inhabitants of the country were still left at the disposal of their imperious lords many attempts were made to give more security and liberty to citizens and make them enjoy unmolested the fruits of their industry Boroughs were erected by royal patent within the demesne lands Liberty of trade was conferred upon them The inhabitants were allowed to farm at a fixt rent their own tolls and customs  Madox Firma Burgi p  They were permitted to elect their own magistrates Justice was distributed to them by these magistrates without obliging  them to attend the sheriff or county courts And some shadow of independence was gradually acquired to the people by means of these equitable privileges  Brady of boroughs Appen No  The King however retained still the power of levying talliages or taxes upon them at pleasure  The King had not only the power of talliating the inhabitants within his own demesnes but that of granting to particular barons the power of talliating the inhabitants within theirs See Brady's answer to Petyt p Madox hist of the Exchequer p  and tho' their poverty and the customs of the age made these demands neither frequent nor exorbitant such unlimited authority in the sovereign was sensible check upon commerce and was utterly incompatible with all the principles of a free government But when the multiplied necessities of the crown produced a greater demand for supply the King whose prerogative entitled him to exact it found that he had not power sufficient to enforce his edicts and that it was requisite before he imposed taxes to smooth the way for his demand and to obtain the previous consent of the boroughs by sollicitation remonstrances and authority The inconvenience of transacting this business with every particular borough was soon felt and Edward became sensible that the most expeditious way of obtaining supply was to assemble together the deputies of all the boroughs to lay before them the necessities of the state to discuss the matter in their presence and to require their consent to the demands of their sovereign For this reason he issued writs to the sheriffs enjoining them to send to parliament along with two knights of the shire two deputies from each borough within their county  Writs were issued to about cities and boroughs  and these provided with sufficient powers from their community to consent in their name to what he and his council should require of them  As it is a most equitable rule  says he in his preamble to this writ  that what concerns all should be approved of by all and common dangers be repelled by united efforts  Brady of boroughs p from the records

which they were sent the sheriff when he found no person of abilities or wealth sufficient for this office often used the freedom of omitting particular boroughs in his returns and as he received the thanks of the people for this indulgence he gave no offence to the court who levied without distinction the tax agreed to by the majority of deputies  Brady of boroughs p from the records There is even an instance in the reign of Edward III when the King named all the deputies Id ans to Petyt p If he fairly named the most considerable and creditable burgesses little exception would be taken as their business was not to check the King but to reason with him and consent to his demands It was not till the reign of Richard II that the sheriffs were deprived of the power of omitting boroughs at pleasure See Stat at large th Rich II cap    THE union however of the representatives from all the boroughs gave gradually more weight to the whole order and it became customary for them in return for the supplies which they granted to prefer petitions to the crown for the redress of any particular grievances of which they found reason to complain The more the King's demands multiplied the faster these petitions encreased both in number and authority and the prince found it difficult to refuse men whose grants had supported his throne and to whose assistance he might so soon be again obliged to have recourse The commons however were still much below the rank of legislators  In the reign of Henry IV the King told the commons that they were only petitioners that is they had not any proper legislative authority Cotton's abridg p All judgment says the Record appertains to the King and the lords The commons were so little accustomed to transact public business that they had no speaker till after the parliament th Edw III See Prynne's preface to Cotton's abridg Not till the first of Richard II in the opinion of most antiquarians The commons were very unwilling to meddle in any state affairs and commonly either referred themselves to the lords or desired a select committee of that huuse to assist them as appears from Cotton E III n E III n E III n E III n E III n E III n R II n R II n R II n parl R II n parl R II n c  Their petitions tho' they received a verbal  assent from the throne were only the rudiments of laws The judges were afterwards entrusted with the power of putting them into form And the King by adding to them the sanction of his authority and that sometimes without the assent of the nobles bestowed validity upon them The age did not refine so much as to perceive the danger of these irregularities No man was displeased that the sovereign at the desire of any class of men should issue an order which only concerned that class and his predecessors were so near possessing the whole legislative power that he gave no disgust by assuming it in this seemingly inoffensive manner But time and farther experience gradually opened mens eyes and corrected such abuses It was found that no laws could be fixed for one order of men without affecting the whole and that the force and efficacy of laws depended entirely on the terms employed in wording them The house of peers therefore the most powerful order of the state reasonably expected that their assent should be expressly granted to all public ordinances  In these instances found in Cotton's abridgement where the King appears to answer of himself the petitions of the commons he probably exerted no more than that power which was long inherent in the crown of regulating lesser matters by his edicts or proclamations But no durable or general statute seems ever to have been made by the King from the petition of the commons alone without the assent of the peers  And in the reign of Henry V the commons required that no laws should be framed merely upon their petitions unless the statutes were worded by themselves and had passed their house in the form of a bill  Brady's answer to Petyt p from the records    BUT as the same causes which produced a partition of property continued still to operate the number of knights and lesser barons or what the English call the gentry perpetually encreased and sunk into a rank still more inferior to the great nobility The equality of tenure was lost in the great inferiority of power and property and the house of representatives from the counties was gradually separated from that of the peers and formed a distinct order in the state  Cotton's abridgement p  The growth of commerce meanwhile augmented the private wealth and consideration of the burgesses the frequent demands of the crown encreased their public importance and as they resembled the knights of shires in one material circumstance that of representing particular bodies of men it no longer appeared unsuitable to unite them together in the same house and to confound their  rights and privileges  It was very agreeable to the maxims of all the feudal governments that every order of the state should give their consent to the acts which more immediately concerned them and as the notion of a political system was not then so well understood the other orders of the state were often not consulted on these occasions In this reign even the merchants tho' no public body granted the King impositions on merchandize because the first payments came out of their pockets They did the same in the reign of Edward III but the commons had then observed that the people paid these duties tho' the merchants advanced them and they therefore remonstrated against this practice Cotton's abridg p The taxes imposed by the knights on the counties were always lighter than those which the burgesses laid on the boroughs a presumption that in voting these taxes the knights and burgesses did not form the same house See chancellor West's enquiry into the manner of creating peers p But there are so many proofs that these two orders of representatives were long separate that it is needless to insist on them Mr Carte who had carefully consulted the rolls of parliament affirms that they never appear to have been united till the th of Edward III See Hist vol p But 'tis certain that this union was not even then final In the burgesses acted by themselves and voted a tax after the knights were dismissed See Tyrrel Hist vol p from Rot Claus Edw III n In they were the knights alone who passed a vote for the removal of Alice Pierce from the King's person if we may credit Walsingham p There is an instance of a like kind in the reign of Richard II Cotton p The different taxes voted by these two branches of the lower house kept them naturally separate But as their petitions had mostly the same object viz the redress of grievances and the support of law and justice both against the crown and the barons this cause as naturally united them and was the reason why they at last joined in one house for the dispatch of business The barons had few petitions There privileges were of more antient date Grievances seldom affected them They were themselves the chief oppressors In the knights by themselves concurred with the bishops and barons in advising the King to stay his journey into Ireland Here was a petition which regarded a matter of state and was supposed to be above the capacity of the burgesses The knights therefore acted a part in this petition See Cotton abridg p Chief baron Gilbert thinks that the reason why taxes began always with the commons or burgesses was that they were limited by the instructions of their boroughs See hist of the Exchequer p  Thus the third estate that of the commons reached at last its present form and as the country gentlemen made thenceforwards no scruple of appearing as deputies of the boroughs the distinction between the members was entirely lost and the lower house acquired thence a great accession of weight and importance in the kingdom Still however the office of this estate was very different from that which it has since exercised with so much advantage to the public Instead of checking and controuling the authority of the King they were naturally induced to adhere to him as the great fountain of law and justice and to support him against the exorbitant power of the aristocracy which was at once the source of oppression to themselves and disturbed him in the execution of the laws The King in his turn gave countenance to an order of men so useful and so little dangerous The peers also were obliged to pay them some consideration And by this means the third estate formerly so abject in England as well as in all other European nations rose by slow degrees to their present importance  and in their progress made arts and commerce the necessary attendants of liberty and equality flourish in the kingdom  The chief argument from antient authority for the opinion that the representatives of boroughs preceded the fortyninth of Henry III is the famous petition of the borough of St Albans first taken notice of by Selden and then by Petyt Brady Tyrrel and others In this petition presented to the parliament in the reign of Edward II the town of St Albans asserts that tho' they held  in capite  of the crown and owed only for all other services their attendance in parliament yet the sheriff had omitted them in his writs whereas both in the reign of the King's father and all his predecessors they had always sent members Now say the defenders of this opinion if the commencement of the house of commons was in Henry III's reign this expression could not have been used But Madox in his History of the Exchequer p has endeavoured to destroy the authority of this petition for the purpose alledged He asserts first that there was no such tenure in England as that of holding by attendance in parliament instead of all other service Secondly That the borough of St Albans never held of the crown at all but was always demesne land of the abbot It is no wonder therefore that a petition which advances two falshoods should contain one historical mistake which indeed amounts only to an inaccurate expression Accordingly St Albans continued still to belong to the abbot It never held of the crown till after the dissolution of the monasteries But the assurance of these petitioners is remarkable They wanted to shake off the authority of their abbot and to hold of the King but were unwilling to pay any services even to the crown Upon which they framed this petition which latter writers have made the foundation of so many inferences and conclusions From the tenor of the petition it appears that there was a close connexion between holding of the crown and being represented in parliament The latter had scarce ever place without the former Yet we learn from Tyrrel's Append vol that there were some instances to the contrary It is not improbable that Edward followed the roll of the earl of Mountfort who had summoned without distinction all the considerable boroughs of the kingdom among whom there might be some few who did hold of the crown Edward also found it necessary to impose taxes on all the boroughs of the kingdom without distinction This was a good expedient for augmenting his revenue    WHAT sufficient y proves that the commencement of the house of burgesses who were the true commons was not an affair of chance but arose from the necessities of the present situation is that Edward at the very same time summoned deputies from the inferior clergy the first that ever met in England  Archbp Wake's State of the Church of England p Brady of boroughs p Gilbert's Hist of the Exch p  and he required them to impose taxes on their constituents for the public service Formerly the ecclesiastical benefices bore no part of the burthens of the state The Pope had indeed of late often levied impositions upon them He had sometimes granted this power to the sovereign  Ann Waverl p T Wykes p  Edward himself had in the former year exacted by menaces and violence a very grievous tax of half their revenue But as this precedent was dangerous and could not easily be repeated in a government which required the consent of the subject to any extraordinary resolution Edward found it more prudent to assemble a lower house of convocation to lay before them his necessities and to ask some supply But on this occasion he met  with difficulties Whether that the clergy thought themselves the most independant body of men in the kingdom or were disgusted by the former exorbitant impositions they absolutely refused their assent to the King's demand of a fifth of their moveables and it was not till a second meeting that on their persisting in this refusal he was willing to accept of a tenth The barons and knights granted him without hesitation an eleventh the burgesses a seventh But the clergy still scrupled to meet on the King's writ lest by such obedience they should seem to acknowledge the authority of the temporal power And this compromise was at last fallen upon that the King should issue his writ to the archbishop and that the archbishop should in consequence of it summon the clergy who as they then appeared to obey their spiritual superior no longer hesitated to meet in convocation This expedient however was the cause why the ecclesiastics met in two houses of convocation under their several archbishops and formed not one estate like those in other countries of Europe as was at first the King's intention  Gilbert's Hist of Excheq p  We now return to the course of our narration  EDWARD conscious of the reasons of disgust which he had given the King of Scots informed of the dispositions of that people and expecting the most violent effects of their resentment which he knew he had so well merited employed the supplies granted him by his people in making preparations against the hostilities of his northern neighbour When in this situation he received intelligence of the treaty secretly concluded between John and Philip and tho' uneasy at this concurrence of a French and Scots war he resolved not to encourage his enemies by a pusillanimous behaviour or by yielding to their united efforts He summoned John to perform the duty of a vassal and to send him a supply of forces against an invasion from France with which he was then threatened He next required that the fortresses of Berwic Jedborough and Roxborough should be put into his hands as a security during the war  Rymer vol p Walsin p Heming vol p Trivet p  He cited John to appear in an English parliament held at Newcastle And when none of these successive demands were complied with he marched northward with numerous forces foot and horse to chastise his rebellious vassal The Scottish nation who had little reliance on the vigour and spirit of their prince assigned him a council of twelve noblemen in whose hands the sovereignty was really lodged  Heming vol p  and who put the country in the best posture of which the present distractions would admit A great army composed of infantry tho' supported only by cavalry advanced to the frontiers and after a fruitless attempt  upon Carlisle marched eastwards to defend those provinces which Edward was preparing to attack But some of the most considerable of the Scottish nobles Robert Bruce the father and son the earls of March and Angus prognosticating the ruin of their country from the concurrence of intestine divisions and a foreign invasion endeavoured here to ingratiate themselves with Edward by an early submission and the King encouraged by this favourable incident led his army into the enemies' country and crossed the Tweed without opposition at Coldstream  th March  He then received a message from John by which that prince having now procured for himself and his nation Pope Celestine's dispensation from former oaths renounced the homage which had been done to England and set Edward at defiance  Rymer vol p Walsin p Heming vol p  This bravado was but ill supported by the military operations of the Scots Berwic was already taken by assault Sir William Douglas the governor was made prisoner Above of the garrison were put to the sword  Walsin p Heming vol Trivet p  And Edward elated by this great advantage dispatched earl Warrenne with men to lay siege to Dunbar which was defended by the flower of the Scottish nobility  THE Scots sensible of the importance of this place which if taken laid their whole country open to the enemy advanced with their main army under the command of the earls of Buchan Lenox and Mar in order to relieve it Warrenne not dismayed by the great superiority of their number marched out to give them battle  th April  He attacked them with great vigour and as undisciplined troops the more numerous they are are but the more exposed to a panic upon any alarm he soon threw them into confusion and chaced them off the field with great slaughter  Walsin p Heming vol p Trivet p Chron Dunst vol p  The loss of the Scots is said to have amounted to men The castle of Dunbar with all its garrison surrendered next day to Edward who after the battle had brought up the main body of the English and who now

Stuart was again obliged to swear fealty to Edward After a feeble resistance the castles of Edinburgh and Stirling opened their gates to the enemy All the southern parts were instantly subdued by the English and to enable them the better to reduce the northern whose inaccessible situation seemed to give them some more security Edward received a strong reinforcement of Welsh and Irish who being accustomed to a desultory kind of war were the best qualified to pursue the fugitive Scots into  the recesses of their lakes and mountains  Heming vol p Chron Dunst vol p    Scotland subdued  But the spirit of the nation was already broke by their misfortunes and the feeble and timid Baliol discontented with his own subjects and overawed by the English abandoned all those resources which his people might yet have possessed in this extremity He hastened to make his submission to Edward he expressed the deepest penitence for his disloyalty to his liege lord and he made a solemn and irrevocable resignation of his crown into the hands of that monarch  Rymer vol p Walsing p Heming vol p Trivet p  Edward marched northwards to Aberdeen and Elgin without meeting an enemy No Scotsman approached him but to pay him submission and do him homage  Heming vol p  Even the turbulent highlanders ever refractory to their own princes and averse to the restraint of laws endeavoured to prevent the devastation of their country by giving him early proofs of obedience And Edward having brought the whole kingdom to a seeming state of tranquility returned to the south with his army There was a stone to which the popular superstition of the Scots paid the highest veneration All their Kings were seated on it when they received the rite of inauguration An antient tradition assured them that wherever this stone was placed their nation should always govern And it was carefully preserved at Scone as the true palladium of their monarchy and their ultimate resource amidst all their misfortunes Edward got possession of it and carried it with him to England  Walsing p Trivet p  He gave orders to destroy all the records and all those monuments of antiquity which might preserve the memory of the independance of the kingdom and refute the English claims of superiority The Scots pretend that he also destroyed all the annals preserved in their convents But it is not probable that a nation so rude and unpolished would be possessed of any history which deserves much to be regreted The great seal of Baliol was broke and that prince himself was carried a prisoner to London and committed to custody in the Tower Two years afterwards he was restored to his liberty and submitted to a voluntary banishment in France where without making any farther attempts for the recovery of his royalty he died in a private station Earl Warrenne was left governor of Scotland  Rymer vol p Trivet p  Englishmen were entrusted with all the chief offices And Edward flattering himself that he had attained the end of all his wishes and that the long train of fraud and violence which he had practised against Scotland had terminated in the final reduction of that kingdom returned with his victorious army into England  War with France  AN attempt which he made about the same time for the recovery of Guienne was not equally successful He sent thither an army of men under the  command of his brother the earl of Lancaster and that prince gained at first some advantages over the French at Bourdeaux But he was soon after seized with a distemper of which he died at Bayonne The command devolved on the earl of Lincoln who was not able to perform any thing considerable during the rest of the campaign  Heming vol p    BUT the active and ambitious spirit of Edward while his conquests brought such considerable accessions to the English monarchy could never be satisfied so long as Guienne the antient patrimony of his family was wrested from him by the dishonest artifices of the French monarch Finding that the distance of that province rendered all his efforts against it feeble and uncertain he proposed to attack France in a quarter where she appeared more vulnerable and with this view he married his daughter Elizabeth to John earl of Holland and at the same time contracted an alliance with Guy earl of Flanders stipulated to pay him the sum of l and projected an invasion with their united forces upon Philip their common enemy  Rymer vol p Walsing p  He hoped that when he himself at the head of the English Flemish and Dutch armies reinforced by his German allies to whom he had promised or remitted very considerable sums should enter the frontiers of France and threaten the capital itself with imminent danger Philip would at last be obliged to relinquish his acquisitions and pu chase peace by the restitution of Guienne But in order to set this great machine in movement considerable supplies were requisite from the parliament and Edward without much difficulty obtained from the barons and knights a new grant of a twelfth of all their moveables and from the boroughs that of an eigh h The great and almost unlimited power of the King over the latter enabled him to throw the heaviest part of the burthen on them and the prejudices which he seems always to have entertained against the church on account of their former zeal for the Mountfort faction made him resolve to load them wi h still more considerable impositions and he required of them a fifth of their moveables But he here met with an opposition which for some time disconcerted all his measures and engaged him in enterprizes which were somewhat dangerous to  him  and would have proved ruinous to any of his predecessors  with the clergy  BONIFACE VIII who had succeeded Celestine in the papal throne was a man of the most lofty and enterprizing spirit and tho' he wanted that austerity of manners which commonly accompanies ambition in men of his order he was determined to carry the authority of the tiara and his do ninion over the temporal power to as great a height as it had ever attained in any former period Sensible that  his immediate predecessors by oppressing the church in every province of Christendom had extremely alienated the affections of the clergy and had afforded the civil magistrate a pretence for laying like impositions on ecclesiastical revenues he attempted to resume the former station of the sovereign pontiff and to establish himself as the common protector of the spiritual order against all invaders For this purpose he issued very early in his pontificate a general bull probihiting all princes to levy without his consent any taxes from the clergy and all clergymen to submit to such impositions and threatening both of them with the penalties of excommunication in case of disobedience  Rymer vol p Heming vol p  This important edict is said to have been procured by the solicitation of Robert de Winchelsey archbishop of Canterbury who intended to employ it as a rampart against the violent extortions which the church had felt from Edward and the still greater which that prince's multiplied necessities gave them reason to apprehend When a demand therefore was made on the clergy of a fifth of their moveables a tax which was probably much more grievous than a fifth of their revenue as their lands were mostly stocked with their cattle and cultivated by their villains the clergy took shelter under the bull of Pope Boniface and pleaded conscience in refusing compliance  Heming vol p Trivet p Chron Dunst vol p  The King came not immediately to extremities on this repulse but after locking up all their granaries and barns and prohibiting all rent to be paid them he appointed a new synod to confer upon his demand The primate not dismayed by these proofs of Edward's resolution here plainly told him that the clergy owed obedience to two sovereigns their spiritual and their temporal but their duty bound them to a much stricter attachment to the former than to the latter They could not comply with his commands for such in some measure the requests of the crown were then deemed in contradiction to the express prohibition of the sovereign pontiff  Heming vol p    THE clergy had seen from many proofs that Edward paid very little regard to those numerous privileges on which they set so high a value He had formerly seized in an arbitrary manner all the money and plate lodged in the churches and convents and had applied them to the public service  Walsin p Heming vol p  and they could not but expect more violent treatment on this sharp refusal grounded on such dangerous principles Instead of applying to the Pope for a relaxation of his bull he resolved immediately to employ the power in his hands and he told the ecclesiastics that since they refused to support the civil government they were unworthy to receive any benefit from it and he would accordingly put them out  of the protection of the laws This vigorous measure was immediately carried into execution  Walsin p Heming vol p  Orders were issued to the judges to receive no cause brought before them by the clergy to hear and decide all causes in which they were defendants To do every man justice against them to do them justice against no body  M West p  The ecclesiastics immediately found themselves in the most miserable situation imaginable They could not remain in their own houses or convents for want of subsistance If they went abroad in quest of a maintenance they were dismounted from their horses robbed of their cloaths abused by every ruffian and no redress could be obtained by them for the most violent injury The primate himself was attacked on the high way was stripped of all his equipage and furniture and was at last reduced to board himself with a single servant in the house of a country clergyman  Heming vol p  The King mean while remained an indifferent spectator of all these violences and without employing his officers in commiting any immediate injury on the priests which might have appeared invidious and oppressive he took ample vengeance on them for their obstinate refusal of his demands Tho' the archbishop issued a general sentence of excommunication against all who attacked the persons or property of ecclesiastics it was not regarded while Edward enjoyed the pleasure of seeing the people become the voluntary instruments of his justice against them and enure themselves to throw off that respect for the sacred order by which they had been so long overawed and governed  THE spirits of the clergy were at last broke by this harsh treatment Besides that the whole province of York which lay nearest the danger that still hung over them from the Scots voluntarily from the first voted a fifth of their moveables the bishops of Salisbury Ely and some others made a composition for the secular clergy within their sees and they agreed not to pay the fifth which would have been an act of disobedience to Boniface's bull but to deposite a sum equivalent in some church appointed them where it was taken by the King's officers  Heming vol p Chron Dunst p  Many particular convents and clergymen made payment of a like sum and received the King's protection  Chron Dunst vol p  Those who had not ready money entered into recognizances for the payment And there was scarce found one ecclesiastic in the kingdom who seemed willing to suffer for the sake of religious privileges this new species of martyrdom the most tedious and languishing of any the most mortifying to spiritual pride and not rewarded by that crown of glory which the church holds up with such ostentation to her devoted adherents  Arbitrary measures  BUT as the money granted by parliament tho' considerable was not sufficient to supply the King's necessities and that levied by compositions with the clergy came in slowly Edward was obliged for the sake of farther supply to exert his arbitrary power and to lay an oppressive hand on all orders of men in the kingdom He limited the merchants in the quantity of wool allowed to be exported and at the same time forced them to pay him a duty of forty shillings a sack which was computed to be much above the fifth of the value  Walsing p Trevet p  He seized all the rest of the wool as well as all the leather of the kingdom into his hands and disposed of these commodities for his own benefit  Heming vol p  He required the sheriffs of each county to supply him with quarters of wheat and as many of oats which he permitted them to seize wherever they could find them The cattle and other commodities necessary for supplying his army were laid hold of without the consent of the owners  Heming vol p  And tho' he promised afterwards to pay the equivalent of all these goods men saw but little probability that a prince who submitted so little to the limitations of law could ever amidst his multiplied necessities be reduced to a strict observance of his engagements He showed at the same time an equal disregard to the principles of the feudal law by which all the lands of his kingdom were held In order to encrease his army and enable him to support that great effort which he proposed to make against France he required the attendance of every proprietor of land possessed of twenty pounds a year even tho' he held not of the crown and was not obliged by the tenure of his estate to perform any such service  Walsing p    THESE acts of violence and of arbitrary power notwithstanding the great personal regard generally borne to the King bred murmurs in every order of men and it was not long before some of the great nobility jealous of their own privileges as well as of national liberty gave countenance and authority to these complaints Edward assembled an army on the seacoast which he proposed to send over into Gascony while he himself should in person make an impression on the side of Flanders and he intended to put these forces under the command of Humphrey Bohun earl of Hereford the constable and Roger Bigod earl of Norfolk the mareschal of England But these two powerful earls refused to execute his orders and affirmed that they were only obliged by their office to attend his person in the wars A violent altercation ensued and the King in the height of his passion addressing himself to the constable exclaimed  Sir earl by God you shall either go or hang By God Sir King  replied Hereford  I will neither  go nor hang  Heming vol p  And he immediately departed with the mareschal and above thirty other considerable barons  UPON this opposition the King laid aside the project of an expedition against Guienne and assembled the army which he proposed to transport into Flanders But the two earls irritated in the contest and elated by impunity pretending that none of their ancestors had ever served in that country refused to perform the duty of their office in mustering the army  Rymer vol p Walsin p  The King now finding it adviseable to proceed with moderation instead of forfeiting the earls who possessed their dignities by hereditary right appointed Thomas de Berkeley and Geoffrey de Geyneville to act in that emergence as constable and mareschal  M West p  He endeavoured to reconcile himself with the church took the primate again into favour  Heming vol p  made him in conjunction with Reginald de Grey tutor to the prince whom he proposed to appoint guardian of the kingdom during his absence and he even assembled a great number of the nobility in Westminsterhall to whom he deigned to make an apology for his past conduct He pleaded the urgent necessities of the crown his extreme want of money his engagement from honour as well as interest to support his allies abroad And he promised if ever he returned in safety to redress all their grievances to restore the execution of the laws and to make all his subjects compensation for the losses which they had sustained Meanwhile he begged them to suspend their animosities to judge of him by his future behaviour of which he hoped he would be more master to remain faithful to his government or if he perished in the present war to preserve their allegiance to his son and successor  Heming vol p M West p    THERE were certainly from the concurrence of discontents among the great and the grievances of the people materials sufficient in any other period to have kindled a civil war in England But the vigour and abilities of Edward kept every one in awe and his dexterity in stopping on the brink of danger and retracting the measures to which he was pushed by his violent temper and arbitrary principles saved the nation from so great a calamity The two great earls dared not to break out into open violence and they proceeded no farther than framing a remonstrance which was delivered to the King at Winchelsea when he was ready to embark for Flanders They there complained of the violations of the great charter and that of forests the violent s izure of corn leather cattle and above all of wool a commodity which they affirmed to be equal in value to half the lands of the kingdom the arbitrary imposition of forty shillings  a sack on the small quantity of wool allowed to be exported by the merchants and they claimed an immediate redress of all these grievances  Walsing p Heming vol p Trevet p  The King told them that the greatest part of his council were now absent and without their advice he could not deliberate on measures of so great consequence  Walsing p Heming vol p Trevet p    Dissensions with the barons  But the constable and mareschal with the barons of their party resolved to take advantage of Edward's absence and to obtain an authentic assent to their demands When summoned to attend the parliament at London they came with a great body of cavalry and infantry and before they would enter the city required that the gates should be put into their custody  Heming vol p  The primate who secretly favoured all their pretensions advised the council to comply and thus they became masters both of the young prince and of the resolutions of parliament Their demands however were very moderate and such as sufficiently justify the purity of their intention in all their past measures They only required that the two charters should receive a solemn confirmation that a clause should be added to secure the nation for ever against all impositions and taxes without consent of parliament and that they themselves and their adherents who had refused to attend the King into Flanders should be pardoned for this offence and should be again received into favour  Walsing p Heming vol p Trevet p  The prince of Wales and his council assented to these terms and the charters were sent over to the King in Flanders to be there confirmed by him Edward felt the utmost reluctance to this measure which he apprehended would for the future impose fetters on his conduct and set limits to his lawless authority Under various pretences he delayed three days the giving any answer to the deputies and when the pernicious consequences of his refusal were represented to him he was at last obliged after many internal struggles to affix his seal to the charters as also to the clause that bereaved him of the power which he had hitherto assumed of imposing arbitrary taxes upon the people  Walsing p Heming vol p    THAT we may finish at once this interesting transaction concerning the settlement of the charters we shall briefly mention the subsequent events which relate to it The constable and mareschal informed of the King's compliance were satisfied and not only ceased from disturbing the government but assisted the regency with all their power against the Scots who had risen in arms and had thrown off the yoke of the English  Heming vol p  But being sensible that the smallest pretence would suffice to make Edward retract these detested laws which tho' they  had often received the sanction both of King and parliament and had been acknowledged during three reigns were never yet deemed to have sufficient valid ty they insisted that he should again confirm them on his return to England and should thereby renounce all plea which he might derive from his residing in a foreign country when he formerly affixed his seal to them  Heming vol p  It appeared that they judged aright of Edward's character and intentions He delayed this confirmation as long as possible and when the fear of worse consequences obliged him again to comply he added expressly a salvo for his royal dignity or prerogative which in effect enervated the force of the whole charter  Heming vol p  The two earls and their adherents left the parliament in discontent and the King was constrained in a future session to grant the people without any subterfuge a pure and absolute confirmation of those laws  Heming vol p  which were so much the object of their passionate affection Even farther securities were then provided for the establishment of national privileges Three knights were appointed to be chosen in each county and were invested with the power of punishing by fines and imprisonment every transgression or violation of the charters  Hemingford vol p  A precaution which tho' it was soon disused as encroaching too much on royal prerogative proves the attachment which the English in that age bore to liberty and their well founded jealousy of the arbitrary disposition of Edward  THE work however was not yet entirely finished and compleat In order to execute the lesser charter it was requisite by new perambulations to set bounds to the royal forests and to desafforest all those lands which former encroachments had comprehended within their limits Edward discovered the same reluctance to comply with this equitable demand and it was not till after many delays on his part and many sollicitations and requests and even menaces of war and violence  Walsing p We are told by Tyrrel vol p from the Chronicle of St Albans that the barons not contented with the execution of the charter of forests demanded of Edward as high terms as had been imposed on his father by the earl of Leicester But no other historian mentions this particular  on the part of the barons that the perambulations were made and exact boundaries fixt by a jury in each county to the extent of his forests  Heming vol p M West p  Had not his ambitious and active temper raised him so many foreign enemies and obliged him to have recourse so often to the assistance of his subjects it is likely that these concessions could never have been extorted from him  BUT while the people after so many successful strugles deemed themselves happy in the secure possession of their privileges they were surprized in to find that Edward had secretly applied to Rome and had procured from that mercenary court an absolution from all the oaths and engagements which he had so often reiterated to observe both the charters There are some historians  Brady vol p Carte vol p  so credulous as to imagine that this perilous step was taken by him for no other purpose than to acquire the merit of granting a new confirmation of the charters as he did soon after and a confirmation so much the more unquestionable that it could never after be invalidated by his successors from the pretence of any force or violence which had been imposed on him But besides that this might have been done with a much better grace if he had never applied for any such absolution the whole tenor of his conduct proves him to be little susceptible of such refinements in patriotism and this very deed itself in which he confirmed anew the charters carries in the face of it a very opposite presumption Tho' he ratified the charters in general he still laid hold of the papal bull so far as to invalidate the late perambulations of the forests which had been made with such care and attention and to reserve to himself the power in case of favourable incidents to extend as much as formerly these arbitrary jurisdictions If the power was not in fact made use of we can only conclude that the favourable incidents did not occur  THUS after the contests of near a whole century and those ever accompanied with violent jealousies often with public convulsions the great charter was finally established and the English nation have the honour of extorting by their perseverance this concession from the ablest the most warlike and the most ambitious of all their princes  It must however be remarked that the King never forgave the chief actors in this transaction and he found means afterwards to oblige both the constable and mareschal to resign their offices into his hands The former received a new grant of it But the office of mareschal was given to Thomas of Brotherton the King's second son  It is computed that above thirty confirmations of it were at different times required of several Kings and granted by them in full parliament a precaution which while it discovers some ignorance of the true nature of law and government proves a very laudable jealousy of national privileges in the people and an extreme anxiety lest contrary precedents should ever be pleaded as an authority for infringing them Accordingly we find that tho' arbitrary practices often prevailed and were even able to establish themselves into settled customs the validity of the great charter was never afterwards formally disputed and that grant was still regarded as the basis of the English government and the sure rule by which the authority of every custom was to be tried and canvassed The jurisdiction of the Starchamber martial law imprisonment  by warrants from the privy council and other practices of a like nature tho' established for several centuries were scarce ever allowed by the English to be parts of their constitution The affection of the nation for liberty still prevailed over all precedent and even all political reasoning The exercise of these powers after being long the source of secret murmurs among the people was in fullness of time solemnly abolished as illegal at least as oppressive by the whole legislative authority  To return to the period from which this account of the charters has led us Tho' the King's impatience to appear at the head of his armies in Flanders made him overlook all considerations either of domestic discontents or of commotions among the Scots he had been so long retarded by the several obstructions thrown in his way that he lost the proper season for action and after his arrival made no progress against the enemy The King of France takiing advantage of his absence had broke into the Low Countries had defeated the Flemings in the battle of Furnes had made himself master of Lisle St Omer Courtrai and Ypres and seemed in a situation to take full vengeance on the earl of Flanders his rebellious vassal But Edward seconded by an English army of men for this is the number assigned by historians  Heming vol p  was soon able to stop the career or his victories and Philip finding all the weak resources of his kingdom to be already exhausted began to dread a reverse of fortune and to apprehend an invasion on France itself The King of England on the other hand disappointed of assistance from Adolph King of the Romans which he had purchased at a very high price and finding many urgent calls for his presence in England was desirous of ending on any honourable terms a war which served only to divert his force from the execution of more important projects This disposition of both monarchs soon produced a cessation of hostilities for two years and engaged them to submit their differences to the arbitration of Pope Boniface  BONIFACE was the last of the sovereign pontiffs who exercised an authority over the temporal jurisdiction of princes and these exorbitant pretensions which he had been tempted to assume from the successful example of his predecessors but of which the season was now past involved him in so many calamities and were attended with so unfortunate a catastrophe that they have been secretly abandoned tho' never openly relinquished by his successors in the apostolic chair Edward and Philip equally jealous of papal claims took care to insert in their reference that Boniface was made judge of the differences by their consent as a  private person not by any right of his pontificate and the Pope without seeming to be offended at this mortifying clause proceeded to give a sentence between them in which they both acquiesced  Rymer vol p Heming vol p Trivet p  He brought them to agree that their union should be cemented by a double marriage that of Edward himself who was now a widower with Margaret Philip's sister and that of the prince of Wales with Isabella the daughter of that monarch  Rymer vol p  Philip was likewise willing to restore Guienne to the English which he had indeed no pretensions to detain  Peace with France  but he insisted that the Scots and their King John Baliol should as his allies be also comprehended in the treaty and should be restored to their liberty The difference was after several disputes compromised by making mutual sacrifices to each other Edward agreed to abandon his ally the earl of Flanders on condition that Philip should treat in like manner his ally the King of Scots The prospect of conquering these two countries whose situation made them so commodious an acquisition to the different kingdoms prevailed over all other considerations and tho' they were both finally disappointed in their hopes their conduct was very reconcilable to the principles of an interested policy This was the first specimen which the Scots had of the French alliance and which was exactly conformable to what a smaller power must always expect when it blindly attaches itself to the will and fortunes of a greater That unhappy people now engaged in a brave tho' unequal contest for their liberties were totally abandoned by the ally in whom they reposed their final confidence to the will of an imperious conqueror  Revolt of Scotland  THO' England as well as other European countries was in its antient state very ill qualified for making and still worse for maintaining conquests Scotland was so much inferior in its internal force and was so ill situated for receiving foreign succours that it is no wonder an ambitious monarch should have cast his eye on so tempting an acquisition which brought both security and greatness to his native kingdom But the instruments whom Edward employed to maintain his dominion over the northern kingdom were not happily chosen and acted not with the requisite prudence and moderation in reconciling the Scottish nation to a yoke which they bore with such extreme reluctance Warrenne retiring into England on account of his bad state of health left the administration entirely in the hands of Ormesby who was appointed justiciary of Scotland and Cressingham who bore the office of treasurer and a very small military force remained to secure the precarious authority of these ministers The latter had no other  object but the amassing money by rapine and injustice The former distinguished himself by the rigor and severity of his temper And both of them treating the Scots as a conquered people made them sensible too early of the grievous servitude into which they had fallen As Edward required that all the proprietors of land should swear fealty to him every one who refused or delayed the giving this testimony of submission was outlawed and confined and punished without mercy and the bravest and most generous spirits of the nation were thus exasperated to the highest degree against the English government  Walsing p Heming vol p Trevet p    THERE was one William Wallace of a small fortune but descended of an antient family in the west of Scotland whose courage prompted him to undertake and enabled him finally to execute the desperate attempt of delivering his native country from the dominion of foreigners This man whose valorous exploits are the object of just admiration but have been much exaggerated by the traditions of his countrymen had been provoked by the insolence of an English officer to put him to death and finding himself obnoxious on that account to the severity of the administration he fled into the woods and offered himself as a leader to all those whom their crimes or bad fortune or avowed hatred of the English had reduced to a like necessity He was endowed with a gigantic force of body with heroic courage of mind with disinterested magnanimity with an incredible patience and ability to bear hunger fatigue and all the severities of the seasons and he soon acquired among those desperate fugitives that authority to which his virtues so justly intitled him Beginning with small attempts in which he was always successful he gradually proceeded to more momentuous enterprizes and he discovered equal caution in securing his followers and valour in annoying the enemy By his knowledge of the country he was enabled when pursued to ensure a retreat among the morasses or forests or mountains and again collecting his dispersed associates appeared unexpectedly in another quarter and surprized and routed and put to the sword the unwary English Every day brought accounts of his great actions which were received with no less favour by his countrymen than terror by the enemy All those who thirsted after military fame were desirous to partake of his renown His successful valour seemed to vindicate the nation from the ignominy into which it had fallen by its tame submission to the English And tho' no nobleman of note ventured as yet to join his party he had gained a general confidence and attachment which birth and fortune are not alone able to confer  WALLACE having by many fortunate enterprizes brought the valour of his followers to correspond to his own resolved to strike a decisive blow against the English government and he concerted the plan of attacking Ormesby at Scone and of taking vengeance on him for all the violence and tyranny of which he had been guilty The justiciary apprized of his intention fled hastily into England All the other officers of that nation imitated his example Their terror added alacrity and courage to the Scots who betook themselves to arms in every quarter Many of the principal barons and among the rest sir William Douglas  Walsin p Heming vol p  openly countenanced Wallace's party Robert Bruce secretly favoured and promoted the same cause And the Scots shaking off their fetters prepared themselves to defend by an united effort that liberty which they had so unexpectedly recovered from the hands of their oppressors  BUT Warrenne collecting an army of men in the north of England prepared to reestablish his authority and he endeavoured by the celerity of his armament and of his march to compensate for his past negligence which had enabled the Scots to shake off the English government He suddenly entered Annandale and came up with the enemy at Irvine before their forces were fully collected and before they had put themselves in a proper posture of defence Many of the Scots nobles alarmed with their dangerous situation here submitted to the English renewed their oaths of fealty promised to deliver hostages for their good behaviour and received a pardon for all past offences  Heming vol p  Others who had not yet declared themselves such as the steward of Scotland and the earl of Lennox joined tho' with reluctance the English army and waited a favourable opportunity of embracing the cause of their distressed countrymen But Wallace whose authority over his retainers was more fully confirmed by the absence of the great nobles persevered obstinately in his purpose and finding himself unable to give battle to the enemy he marched northwards with an intention of prolonging the war and of turning to his advantage the situation of that mountainous and barren country When Warrenne advanced to Stirling he found Wallace encamped at Cambuskenneth on the opposite banks of the Forth and being continually urged by the impatient Cressingham who was actuated both by personal and national animosities against the Scots  Heming vol p  he prepared to attack them in that position which Wallace no less prudent than courageous had chosen for his army  On the th of September  In spite of the remonstrances of Sir Richard Lundy a Scotsman of birth and family who sincerely adhered to the English he ordered his army to pass a bridge which lay over the Forth but he was soon convinced by fatal  experience of the error of his conduct Wallace allowing such numbers of the English to pass as he thought proper attacked them before they were fully formed put them to rout pushed part of them into the river where they were drowned destroyed the rest by the edge of the sword and obtained a complete victory over them  Walsin p Heming vol p Trivet p  Among the slain was Cressingham himself whose memory was so extremely odious to the Scots that they flea'd his dead body and made saddles and girths of his skin  Heming vol p  Warrenne finding the remainder of his army extremely dismayed by this misfortune was obliged again to evacuate the kingdom and retire into England The castles of Roxborough and Berwick ill fortified and feebly defended fell soon after into the hands of the Scots  WALLACE universally revered as the deliverer of his country now received from the hands of his followers the dignity of regent or guardian under the captive Baliol and finding that the disorders of war as well as the unfavourable seasons had produced a famine in Scotland he urged his army to march into England to subsist at the expence of the enemy and to revenge all past injuries by committing retaliations on that hostile nation The Scots who deemed every thing possible under such a leader joyfully attended his call and Wallace breaking into the northern counties during the winter season laid every place waste with fire and sword and after extending on all sides without opposition the fury of his ravages as far as the bishopric of Durham he returned loaded with spoils and crowned with glory into his own country  Heming vol p  The disorders which at that time prevailed in England from the refractory behaviour of the constable and mareschal made it impossible to collect an army sufficient to resist the enemy and exposed the nation to this loss and dishonour  BUT Edward who received in Flanders intelligence of these events and had already concluded a truce with France now hastened over into England in certain hopes by his activity and valour not only of wiping off this disgrace but of recovering that important conquest of Scotland which he always regarded as the chief glory and advantage of his reign He appeased the murmurs of his people by concessions and promises He restored to the citizens of London the election of their own magistrates of which they had been bereaved in the latter part of his father's reign He ordered strict enquiry to be made concerning the quantities of corn and other goods which had been violently seized before his departure as if he intended to pay the value to the owners  Rymer vol p  And making public professions of confirming and observing the charters he regained the confidence of the  discontented nobles  Having by all these popular arts rendered himself entirely master of his people he collected the whole military force of England Wales and Ireland and marched with an army of near an hundred thousand combatants to the northern frontiers  NOTHING could have enabled the Scots to resist but for one season so mighty a power except an entire union among themselves but as they were deprived of their King whose personal qualities even when he was present appeared so contemptible and had left among his subjects no principle of attachment to him or his family factions jealousies and animosities unavoidably arose among the great and distracted all their councils The elevation of Wallace tho' purchased by so great merit and such eminent services was the object of envy to the nobility who repined to see a private gentleman raised above them by his rank and still more by his glory and reputation Wallace himself sensible of their jealousy and dreading the ruin of his country from those intestine discords voluntarily resigned his authority and retained only the command over that body of his followers who being accustomed to victory under his standard refused to follow into the field any other leader The chief power devolved on the steward of Scotland and Cummin of Badenoch men of eminent birth under whom the great chieftans were more willing to serve in defence of their country The two Scottish commanders collecting their several forces from every quarter fixed their station at Falkirk and proposed there to abide the assault of the English Wallace was at the head of a third body which acted under his command The Scots army placed the pikemen along their front Interlined the intervals between the three bodies with archers And dreading the great superiority of the English in cavalry endeavoured to secure their front by palisadoes tied together with ropes  Walsing p Heming vol p  In this disposition they expected the approach of the enemy  d July Battle of Falkirk  THE King when he arrived in sight of the Scots was pleased with the prospect of being able by one decisive stroke to determine the fortune of the war and dividing his army also into three bodies he led them to the attack The English archers who began about this time to surpass those of other nations first chaced the Scottish bowmen off the field and then pouring in their arrows among the pikemen who were cooped up within their intrenchments began to throw them into disorder and rendered the assault of the English pikemen and cavalry more easy and successful The whole Scottish army was broke and chaced off the field with great slaughter which the historians attending more to the exaggerated relations of the populace than to the probability of things make amount  to fifty or sixty thousand men  Walsing p T Wykes p Heming vol p Trivet p says only M West p says  It is only certain that the Scots never suffered a greater loss in any action nor one which seemed to threaten more inevitable ruin to their country  IN this general rout of the army Wallace's military skill and presence of mind enabled him to keep his troops together and retiring behind the Carron which lay in his rear he marched leisurely along the banks of that small river which protected him from the enemy Young Bruce who had already given many proofs of his aspiring genius but who served hitherto in the English army appeared on the opposite banks and distinguishing the Scottish chieftain as well by his majestic port as by the intrepid activity of his behaviour called out to him and desired a short conference He here represented to Wallace the fruitless and ruinous enterprize in which he was engaged and endeavoured to perswade him to bend at last his inflexible spirit to submission under superior power and superior fortune He insisted on the unequal contest between a weak state deprived of its head and agitated by intestine discord and a mighty nation conducted by the ablest and most martial monarch of the age and possessed of every resource either for drawing out the war or for pushing it with vigor and activity If the love of his country was his motive for perseverance his obstinacy tended only to prolong her misery if he carried his views to private grandeur and ambition he might reflect that even if Edward should withdraw his armies it appeared from past experience that so many haughty nobles proud of the preeminence of their families would never submit to personal merit whose superiority they were less inclined to regard as an object of admiration than as a reproach and injury to themselves To these exhortations Wallace replied that if he had hitherto acted alone as the champion of his native country it was solely because no second or competitor or what he rather wished no leader had as yet appeared to place himself in that honourable station That the blame lay entirely on the nobility and chiefly on Bruce himself who uniting personal merit to d gnity of family had deserted the post which both nature and fortune by such powerful calls invited him to assume That the Scots possessed of such a head would by their unanimity and concord have surmounted the chief difficulty under which they now laboured and might hope notwithstanding their present losses to oppose successfully all the abilities and power of Edward That Heaven itse f could not set a more glorious prize before the eyes either of virtue or ambition than to conjoin in one object the acquisition of royalty with the defence of national independance And that as the interests of his country no  more than those of a brave man could never be sincerely cultivated by a sacrifice of liberty he himself was determined as far as possible to prolong not her misery but her freedom and was desirous that his own life as well as the existence of the nation might terminate when they could no longer be preserved but by receiving the chains of a haughty victor The gallantry of these sentiments tho' delivered by an armed enemy struck the generous mind of Bruce The flame was conveyed from the breast of one hero to that of another He repented of his engagements with Edward and opening his eyes to the honourable path pointed out to him by Wallace secretly determined to seize the first opportunity of embracing the cause however desperate of his oppressed country  This story is told by all the Scots writers tho' it must be owned that Trivet and Hemingford authors of good credit both agree that Bruce was not in Edward's army    THE subjection of Scotland notwithstanding this great victory of Edward was not yet entirely completed The English army after reducing all the southern provinces was obliged to retire for want of provisions and left the northern counties in the hands of the natives The Scots no less enraged with their present defeat than elevated by their past victories still maintained the contest for liberty but being fully sensible of the great inferiority of their forces they endeavoured by application to foreign courts to procure to themselves some assistance The supplications of the Scottish ministers were rejected by Philip but were more successful with the court of Rome  Scotland again subdued  Boniface pleased with an occasion of exerting his authority wrote a letter to Edward exhorting him to put a stop to the oppressions of Scotland and displaying all the proofs such as they had probably been furnished him by the Scots themselves for the antient independance of that kingdom  Rymer vol p Walsin p Heming vol p Trivet p M West p  Among other arguments hinted at above he mentioned the treaty conducted and finished by Edward himself for the marriage of his son with the heiress of Scotland a treaty which would have been absurd had he been superior lord of the kingdom and had possessed by the feudal law the right of disposing of his ward in marriage He mentioned several other striking facts which fell within the compass of Edward's own knowledge particularly that Alexander when he did homage to the king openly and expressly declared in his presence that he swore fealty not for his crown but for the lands which he held in England And the Pope's letter might have passed for a very reasonable one had he not subjoined his own claim to be liege lord of Scotland a right which had never once been heard of but which with a singular confidence he asserted  to be full entire and derived from the most remote antiquity The affirmative style which had been so successful with him and his predecessors in spiritual contests was never before abused after so egregious a manner in any civil controversy  THE reply which Edward wrote to Boniface's letter contains particulars no less singular and remarkable  Rymer vol p Walsing p Heming vol p Trivet p M West p Ryley p  He there proves the superiority of England by historical facts deduced from Brutus the Trojan who he said first founded the British monarchy in the age of Eli and Samuel He supports his position by all the events which passed in the island before the arrival of the Romans And after laying great stress on the extensive dominion and heroic victories of King Arthur he vouchsafes at last to descend to the times of Edward the elder with which in his speech to the states of Scotland he had chosen to begin his claim of superiority He asserts it to be a fact  notorious and confirmed by the records of antiquity  that the English monarchs had often conferred the kingdom of Scotland on their own subjects had dethroned these vassal kings when unfaithful to them and had substituted others in their place He displays with great pomp the full and complete homage which William had done to Henry II without mentioning the former abolition of that  extorted  deed by King Richard and the renounciation of all future claims of the same nature Yet this paper he begins with a solemn appeal to the Almighty the searcher of hearts for his own firm persuasion of the justice of his claim and no less than an hundred and four barons assembled in parliament at Lincoln concur in maintaining before the Pope under their seals the validity of these pretensions  Rymer vol p Walsing p Heming vol p Trivet p M West p  At the same time however they take care to inform Boniface that tho' they had justified their cause before him they did not receive him for their judge The crown of England was free and sovereign They had sworn to maintain all its royal prerogatives and would never permit the king himself were he willing to relinquish its independancy  THAT neglect almost total of truth and justice which sovereign states discover in their transactions with each other is an evil inveterate in the world is one great source of the misery to which the human species is continually exposed and it may be doubted whether in many instances it is found in the end to contribute to the interests of those princes themselves who thus sacrifice their integrity to their politics As few monarchs have lain under stronger temptations to violate the principles of equity than Edward in his transactions with Scotland so never were they violated with less scruple and reserve  Yet his advantages were hitherto precarious and uncertain and the Scots once rouzed to arms and enured to war began to appear a formidable enemy even to this military and ambitious prince  Scotland again revolts  They chose John Cummin for their regent and not content with maintaining their independance in the northern parts they made incursions into the southern counties which Edward imagined he had totally subdued  th Feb  John de Segrave whom he had left guardian of Scotland led an army to oppose them and lying at Roslin near Edinburgh sent out his forces in three divisions to provide themselves in forage and subsistance from the neighbourhood One party was suddenly attacked by the regent and Sir Simon Fraser and being unprepared were immediately routed and pursued with great slaughter The few that escaped flying to the second division gave warning of the approach of the enemy The soldiers ran to their colours And were immediately led out to take revenge for the death of their countrymen The Scots elated with the advantage already obtained made a vigorous impression upon them The English animated with vengeance maintained a stout resistance The victory was long undecided between them but at last declared itself entirely in favour of the former who broke the English and chaced them to the third division now advancing with a hasty march to support their distressed companions Many of the Scots had fallen in the two first actions most of them were wounded and all of them extremely fatigued by the long continuance of the combat Yet were they so transported with success and military rage that having suddenly recovered their order and arming the followers of their camp with the spoils of the slaughtered enemy they drove with fury upon the ranks of the dismayed English The favourable moment decided the battle which the Scots had they met with a steddy resistence were not long able to maintain The English were chaced off the field Three victories were thus gained in one day  Heming vol p  And the renown of these great exploits seconded by the favourable dispositions of the people soon made the regent master of all the fortresses in the south and it became necessary for Edward to begin anew the conquest of the kingdom  THE King prepared himself for this enterprize with his usual vigour and ability He assembled both a great fleet and a great army and entering the frontiers of Scotland appeared with a force which the enemy could not think of resisting in the open field The English navy which sailed along the coast secured the army from any danger of famine Edward's vigilance preserved them from surprizes And by this prudent disposition they marched victoriously from one extremity of the kingdom to the other ravaging the open country taking in all the castles  Heming vol p    and receiving the submissions of all the nobility even those of Cummin the regent The most obstinate resistance was made by the castle of Brechin defended by Sir Thomas Maule and the place opened not its gates till the death of the governor by discouraging the garrison obliged them to submit to the fate which had overwhelmed the rest of the kingdom  Is again subdued  Wallace tho' he attended the English army in their march found but few opportunities of signalizing that valour which had formerly made him so terrible to his enemies  EDWARD having compleated his conquest which employed him during the space of near two years now undertook the more difficult work of settling the country of establishing a new form of government and of making his acquisition durable to the crown of England He seems to have carried matters to extremity against the natives He abrogated all the Scottish laws and customs  Ryley p    He endeavoured to substitute the English in their place He entirely razed or destroyed all the monuments of antiquity Such records or histories as had escaped his former search were now burnt or dispersed And he hastened by too precipitate steps to abolish entirely the Scottish name and to sink it finally into the English  EDWARD however still deemed his favourite conquest exposed to some danger so long as Wallace was alive and being prompted both by revenge and policy he employed every art to discover his retreat and become master of his person At last that hardy warrior who was determined amidst the universal slavery of his countrymen still to maintain his independance was betrayed into Edward's hands by Sir John Monteith his friend whom he had made acquainted with the place of his concealment The King whose natural bravery should have induced him to respect like qualities in an enemy enraged at some violence committed by Wallace during the fury of war  Walsing p Heming vol p  resolved to overawe the Scots by an example of severity and he ordered Wallace to be carried up in chains to London  August  to be tried as a rebel and traitor tho' he never had made submission nor sworn fealty to England and to be executed on Towerhill  Walsing p Trivet p Murinmuth p  This was the unworthy fate of a hero who thro' a course of many years had with signal conduct intrepidity and perseverance defended against a public and oppressive enemy the liberties of his native country  BUT the barbarous policy of Edward failed of the purpose to which it was directed The Scots already disgusted with the great innovations introduced by  the sword of a conqueror into their laws and government were farther enraged at the injustice and cruelty exercised upon Wallace and all the envy which during his lifetime had attended that gallant chieftain being now buried in his grave he was universally regarded as the champion of Scotland and the patron of her expiring independance The people inflamed with resentment were every where disposed to rise against the English government and it was not long before a new and more fortunate leader presented himself who conducted them to liberty to victory and to vengeance  Robert Bruce  ROBERT BRUCE the son  Hemingford vol p calls him the grandson of Robert and is very particular in the account of the times in which his father and grandfather died Hemingford is the best historian of that age  of that Robert who had been one of the competitors for the crown had succeeded by his father's death to all his pretensions and the death of John Baliol which happened nearly about the same time in France with the captivity of Edward the only son of that prince seemed to open a full career to the genius and ambition of this young nobleman He saw that the Scots when the right to their crown had expired in the males of their antient royal family had been divided into parties nearly equal between the houses of Bruce and Baliol and that every incident which had since happened had tended to wean them from any attachment to the latter The slender capacity of John had proved unable to defend them against their enemies He had meanly resigned his crown into the hands of the conqueror He had before his delivery from captivity reiterated that resignation in a manner seemingly voluntary and had in that act thrown out many reflections extremely dishonourable to his antient subjects whom he publickly called traitors ruffians and rebels and with whom he declared he was determined to maintain no farther connexions  Brady's hist vol App N  o    He had during the time of his exile adhered strictly to that resolution and his son being a prisoner seemed ill qualified to revive the rights now fully abandoned of his family Bruce therefore hoped that the Scots so long exposed from the want of a leader to the oppressions of their enemies would unanimously fly to his standard and would seat him on the vacant throne to which he brought such plausible pretensions His aspiring spirit inflamed by the fervor of youth and buoyed up by his natural courage saw the glory alone of the enterprize or regarded the prod gious difficulties which attended it as the source only of farther glory The miseries and oppressions which he had beheld his countrymen suffer in their unequal contest the repeated defeats and misfortunes which they had undergone proved to him so many incentives to bring  them relief and conduct them to revenge against the haughty victors The circumstances which attended Bruce's first declaration are variously related but we shall rather follow the account given by the Scots historians not that their authority is in general any wise to be compared to that of the English but because they may be supposed to be sometimes better informed concerning facts which so nearly interested their own nation  BRUCE who had long harboured in his breast the design of freeing his enslaved country ventured at last to open his mind to John Cummin a powerful nobleman with whom he lived in strict intimacy He found in his friend all the appearance of his own sentiments and needed to employ no arts of persuasion to make him embrace the resolution of throwing off on the first favourable opportunity the usurped dominion of the English But on the departure of Bruce who attended Edward to London Cummin who either had dissembled all along with him or began to reflect more coolly in his absence on the desperate nature of the undertaking resolved to attone for his crime of assenting to this rebellion by the merit of revealing the secret to the King of England Edward did not immediately commit Bruce to custody because he proposed at the same time to seize his three brothers who resided in Scotland and he contented himself with secretly setting spies upon him and ordering all his motions to be strictly guarded A nobleman of Edward's court Bruce's intimate friend was apprized of his danger but not daring amidst so many watchful eyes to hold any conversation with him he fell on an expedient to give him warning that it was full time he should make his escape He sent him by a servant a pair of gilt spurs and a purse of gold which he pretended to have borrowed from him and left it to the sagacity of his friend to discover the meaning of the present Bruce immediately contrived the means of his escape and as the ground was at that time covered with snow he had the precaution it is said to order his horses to be shod with their shoes turned backwards that he might deceive those who should track his path over the open fields or cross roads thro' which he purposed to travel He arrived in a few days at Dumfries in Annandale the chief seat of his family interest and he happily found a great number of the Scottish nobility there assembled and among the rest John Cummin his former associate  th Feb  THE noblemen were astonished at the appearance of Bruce in their company and still more when he discovered to them the object of his journey He told them that he was come to live or die with them in defence of the liberty of his country and hoped with their assistance to redeem the Scottish name from all the indignities which it had so long suffered from the tyranny of their imperious masters That the sacrifice of the rights of his family was the first injury which had prepared  the way for their ensuing slavery and by resuming them which was his firm purpose he opened to them the joyful prospect of recovering from the fraudulent usurper their antient and hereditary independance That all their past misfortunes had proceeded from their disunion and they would soon appear no less formidable than of old to their enemies if they now deigned to follow into the field their rightful prince who knew no medium between death and victory That their mountains and their valour which had during so many ages protected their liberty from all the efforts of the Roman empire would still be sufficient were they worthy of their generous ancestors to defend them against the utmost violence of the English tyrant That it was unbecoming men born to the most antient independance known in Europe to submit to the will of any masters but fatal to receive those who being irritated by such persevering opposition and enflamed with the highest animosity would never deem themselves secure of their usurped dominion but by exterminating all the antient nobility and even all the antient inhabitants And that being reduced to this desperate extremity it were better for them at once to perish like brave men with their swords in their hands than to dread long and at last undergo the fate of the unfortunate Wallace whose merits in the brave and obstinate defence of his country were finally rewarded by the hands of an English executioner  THE spirit with which this discourse was delivered the bold sentiments which it conveyed the novelty of Bruce's declaration assisted by the graces of his youth and manly deportment made deep impression on the minds of his audience and rouzed all those principles of indignation and revenge with which they had long been secretly actuated The Scottish nobles declared their unanimous resolution to use the utmost efforts in delivering their country from bondage and to second the courage of Bruce in asserting his and their undoubted rights against their common oppressors Cummin alone who had secretly taken his measures with the King opposed this general determination and by representing the great power of England governed by a prince of such uncommon vigour and abilities he endeavoured to set before them the certain destruction which they must apprehend if they again violated their oaths of fealty and shook off their allegiance to the victorious Edward  M West p  Bruce already apprized of his treachery and forseeing the certain failure of all his own schemes of ambition and glory from the opposition of so potent a leader took immediately his resolution and moved partly by resentment partly by policy followed Cummin on the dissolution of the assembly attacked him in the cloysters of the Grey Friars thro' which he passed and running him thro' the body left him for dead Sir Thomas Kirkpatric  one of Bruce's friends asking him soon after if the traitor was slain  I believe so  replied Bruce  And is that a matter  cried Kirkpatric  to be left to conjecture I will secure him  Upon which he drew his dagger ran to Cummin and stabbed him to the heart This deed of Bruce and his associates which contains circumstances justly condemned by our present manners was regarded in that age as an effort of manly vigour and just policy The family of Kirkpatric took for the crest of their arms which they still wear a hand with a bloody dagger And chose for their motto these words  I will secure him  the expression employed by their ancestor when he executed that violent action  Third revolt of Scotland  THE murder of Cummin affixed the seal to the conspiracy of the Scottish nobles They had now no resource left but to shake off the yoke of England or to perish in the attempt The genius of the nation rouzed itself from its present dejection And Bruce flying to different quarters excited his partizans to arms attacked with success the dispersed bodies of the English got possession of many of the castles and having made his authority be acknowledged in most parts of the kingdom was solemnly crowned and inaugurated in the abbey of Scone by the bishop of St Andrews who had zealously embraced his cause The English were again chaced out of the kingdom except such as took shelter in the strong fortresses that remained in their hands and Edward found that the Scots twice conquered in his reign and often defeated must yet be anew subdued Not discouraged with these unexpected difficulties he sent Aymer de Valence with a considerable force into Scotland to check the progress of the insurgents and that general falling unexpectedly upon Bruce at Methven in Perthshire threw his army into such disorder as ended in a total defeat  Walsing p Heming vol p Trevet p  Bruce fought with the most heroic courage was thrice dismounted from his horse in the action and as often recovered himself but was at last obliged to yield to superior fortune and take shelter with a few followers in the western isles The earl of Athole Sir Simon Fraser and Sir Christopher Seton who had been taken prisoners were ordered by Edward to be executed as rebels and traitors  Heming vol p M West p    Many other acts of rigor were exercised by him and that prince vowing revenge against the whole Scottish nation whom he deemed incorrigible in their aversion to his government assembled a great army and was preparing to enter the frontiers secure of success and determined to make the defenceless Scots the victims of his severity When he unexpectedly sickened and died at Carlisle enjoining with his last breath his son and successor to prosecute the enterprize and never to desist till he had finally subdued the kingdom of Scotland  Death th July  He expired in the sixty ninth  year of his age and the thirty fifth of his reign hated by his neighbours but extremely respected and revered by his own subjects  and character of the King  THE enterprizes finished by this prince and the projects which he formed and brought very near to a conclusion were more prudent more regularly conducted and more advantageous to the solid interests of his kingdom than those which were undertaken in any reign either of his ancestors or his successors He restored authority to the government disordered by the weakness of his father he maintained the laws against all the efforts of his turbulent barons he fully annexed to his crown the principality of Wales he took the wisest and most effectual measures for reducing Scotland to a like condition and tho' the equity of this latter enterprize may reasonably be questioned the circumstances of the two kingdoms promised such certain success and the advantage was so visible of uniting the whole island under one head that those who give great indulgence to reasons of state in the measures of princes will not be apt to regard this part of his conduct with much severity But Edward however exceptionable his character may appear on the head of justice is the model of a politic and warlike King He possessed industry penetration courage vigour and enterprize He was frugal in all expences that were not necessary he knew how to open the public treasures on a proper occasion he punished criminals with severity he was gracious and affable to his servants and courtiers and being of a majestic figure expert at all bodily exercises and in the main well proportioned in his limbs notwithstanding the great length and the smallness of his legs he was as well qualified to captivate the populace by his exterior appearance as to gain the approbation of men of sense by his more solid virtues  Miscellaneous transactions of this reign  BUT the chief advantage which the people of England reaped and still continue to reap from the reign of this great prince was the correction extension amendment and establishment of the laws which Edward maintained in great vigour and left much improved to posterity For the work of wise legislators commonly remain while the acquisitions of conquerors often perish with them This merit has justly gained to Edward the appellation of the English Justinian Not only the numerous statutes passed in his reign touch the chief points of jurisprudence and according to Sir Edward Coke  Institute p  truly deserve the name of establishments because they were more constant standing and durable laws than any made since but the regular order of his administration gave an opportunity to the common law to refine itself and brought the judges to a certainty in their determinations and the lawyers to a precision in their pleadings Sir Matthew  Hale has remarked the sudden improvement of English law during this reign and ventures to assert that till his own time it had never received any considerable encrease  History of the English law p  Edward settled the jurisdiction of the several courts first established the office of justice of peace abstained from the practice too common before him of interrupting justice by mandates from the privy council  Anticuli super Cart cap Edward enacted a law to this purpose but it is very doubtful whether he ever observed it We are sure that scarce any of his successors did The multitude of these letters of protection were a ground of complaint by the commons in Edw II See Ryley p This practice is declared illegal by the statute of Northampton passed in the second of Edward III but still continued like many other abuses There are instances of it so late as the reign of Q Elizabeth  repressed robberies and disorders  Statute of Winton  encouraged trade by giving merchants an easy way of recovering their debts  Statute of Acton Burnel  and in short introduced a new face of things by the vigour and wisdom of his government As law began now to be well established the abuse of that happiness began also to be remarked Instead of their former associations for robbery and violence men entered into formal combinations to support each other in lawsuits and it was found requisite to check this grievance by act of parliament  Statute of Conspirators    THERE happened in this reign a considerable alteration in the execution of the laws The King abolished the office of chief justiciary which he thought possessed too much power and was dangerous to the crown  Spelman Gloss in verbo  justiciarius  Gilbert's hist of the Exchequer p  He compleated the division of the court of exchequer into four distinct courts which managed each its several branch without dependance on any one magistrate and as the lawyers invented a method by means of their fictions to carry business from one court to another the several courts became rivals and checks to each other a circumstance which tended much to improve the practice of the law in England  BUT tho' Edward appeared thus thro' his whole reign a friend to law and justice it cannot be said that he was an enemy to arbitrary power and in a government more regular and legal than was that of England in his age such practices as those which may be remarked in his administration would have given sufficient ground of complaint and sometimes were even in his age the object of general displeasure The violent plunder and banishment of the Jews the putting the whole clergy at once out of the protection of law the seizing all the wool and leather of the kingdom the heightening the impositions on the former valuable commodity the new and illegal commission of Trailbaston the taking all the money and plate of monasteries and churches even before he had any quarrel with the clergy the subjecting every man possessed of twenty  pounds a year to military service tho' not bound to it by his tenure his visible reluctance to confirm the great charter as if that concession had had no validity from the deeds of his predecessors the captious clause which he at last annexed to his confirmation his procuring after all the Pope's dispensation from the oaths which he had taken to observe that charter and his levying of arbitrary talliages even after the statute or rather charter by which he had renounced that prerogative these are so many demonstrations of his arbitrary disposition and prove with what exception and reserve we ought to celebrate his love of justice He took care that his subjects should do justice to one another but he desired always to have his own hands free in all his transactions both with them and with his neighbours  THE chief obstruction to the execution of justice in those times was the power of the great barons and Edward was perfectly qualified by his character and abilities to keep these tyrants in awe and to restrain their illegal practices This salutary purpose was accordingly the great object of his attention yet he was imprudently led into a measure which tended very much to encrease and confirm their exorbitant authority He passed a statute which by allowing them to entail their estates made it impracticable to diminish the property of the great families and left them all means of encrease and acquisition  Brady of burroughs p from the records  EDWARD observed a contrary policy with regard to the church He seems to have been the first christian prince who passed a statute of mortmain and prevented by law the clergy from making new acquisitions of lands which by the ecclesiastical canons they were for ever prohibited to alienate The opposition between his maxims with regard to the nobility and ecclesiastics leads us to conjecture that it was only by chance he passed the beneficial statute of mortmain and that his sole object was to maintain the number of knights fees and to prevent the superiors from being defrauded of the profits of wardship marriage livery and other emoluments arising from the feudal tenures This is indeed the reason assigned in the statute itself and appears to have been his real object in enacting it The author of the annals of Waverly ascribes this act chiefly to the King's anxiety for maintaining the military force of the kingdom but adds that he was much mistaken in his purpose for that the Amalekites were overcome more by the prayers of Moses than by the sword of the Israelites  P So also M West p    EDWARD was very active in restraining the usurpations of the church and excepting his ardour for Croisades which adhered to him during his whole life seems in other respects to have been little infected with superstition the vice  chiefly of weak minds But the passion for Croisades was really in that age the passion for glory As the Pope now felt himself somewhat more restrained in his former practice of pillaging the national churches by general impositions upon them he permitted the generals of particular orders who resided at Rome to levy taxes on the several convents subjected to their jurisdiction and Edward was obliged to enact a law against this new abuse It was also become a practice of the court of Rome to provide successors to benefices before they became vacant Edward found it likewise necessary to restrain by law this new source of injustice and imposition  THE tribute of marks a year to which King John in doing homage to the Pope had subjected the kingdom had been pretty regularly paid since his time tho' the vassalage was constantly denied and indeed for fear of giving offence had been but little insisted on The payment was called by a new name of  census  not by that of tribute King Edward seems to have always paid this money with great reluctance and he suffered it at one time to run on for six years  Rymer vol p    at another for eleven  Id p  But as princes in that age stood continually in need of the Pope's good offices for dispensations of marriages and other concessions the court of Rome found always means sooner or latter to catch the money The levying of first fruits was also a new device begun in this reign by which his holiness got his fingers very frequently into the purses of the faithful and the King seems unwarily to have given way to it  EDWARD had by his first wife Eleanor of Castile four sons but Edward his heir and successor was the only one that survived him She also bore him eleven daughters most of whom died in their infancy Joan was married first to the earl of Glocester and after his death to Ralph de Monthermer Margaret espoused John duke of Brabant Elizabeth espoused first John earl of Holland and afterwards the earl of Hereford Mary was a nun at Ambresbury He had by his second wife Margaret of France two sons and a daughter Thomas created earl of Norfolk and Mareschal of England and Edmond who was created earl of Kent by his brother when King The princess died in her infancy  IN the former reign the taxes had been partly scutages partly a proportional part of the moveables granted by parliament In this scutages were entirely Crops and the assessment on moveables was the chief method of taxation Edward in his fourth year had a fifteenth granted him in his fifth year a twelfth in his eleventh year a thirtieth from the laity a twentieth from the clergy in  his eighteenth year a fifteenth in his twenty second year a tenth from the laity a sixth from London and other corporate towns half of their benefices from the clergy in his twenty third year an eleventh from the barons and others a tenth from the clergy a seventh from the burgesses in his twenty fourth year a twelfth from the barons and others an eighth from the burgesses from the clergy nothing because of the Pope's inhibition in his twenty fifth year an eighth from the laity a tenth from the clergy of Canterbury a fifth from those of York in his twenty ninth year a fifteenth from the laity on account of his confirming the perambulation of the forests the clergy granted nothing in his thirty third year first a thirtieth from the barons and others and a twentieth from the burgesses then a fifteenth from all his subjects in his thirty fourth year a thirtieth from all his subjects for knighting his eldest son  THESE taxes were moderate but the King had also duties upon exportation and importation granted him from time to time The heaviest was commonly upon wool Poundage or a shilling a pound was not regularly granted the Kings for life till the reign of Henry V  CHAP XIV EDWARD II  Weakness of the KingHis passion for favouritesPiers GavastonDiscontent of the baronsMurder of GavastonWar with

in this reign  THE prepossessions entertained in favour of young Edward kept the English from being fully sensible of the extreme loss which they had sustained by the death of the great monarch who filled the throne and all men hastened with alacrity to take the oath of allegiance to his son and successor This prince was in the twentythird year of his age was of an agreeable figure of a mild and gentle disposition and having never discovered a propensity to any dangerous vice it was very natural to prognosticate tranquility and happiness from his government  Weakness of the King  But the first act of his reign blasted all these hopes and shewed him to be totally unqualified for that perilous situation in which every English monarch during those ages had from the unstable form of the constitution and the turbulent dispositions of the people derived from it the misfortune to be placed The indefatigable Robert Bruce tho' his army had been dissipated and he himself had been obliged to take shelter in the western isles remained not long in tranquility but before the death of the late King had sallied from his retreat had again collected his followers had appeared in the field and had obtained by surprize an important advantage over Aymer de Valence who commanded the English forces  Trivet p    He was now become so considerable as to have afforded the King of England sufficient glory in subduing him without incurring any danger of his seeing all those mighty preparations made by his father fail in the enterprize But Edward instead of pursuing his advantages man ma  ed but a little way into Scotland and having an  incapacity and equal ave  on for all application or serious b  siness he immediately returned upon his footsteps and dispersed his army His grandees perceived from this conduct that the authority  of the crown fallen into such feeble hands was no longer to be dreaded and that every insolence might be practiced by them with impunity  His passion for favourites  THE next measure taken by Edward gave them an inclination to attack those prerogatives which no longer kept them in awe  Pi  rs Gavaston  There was one Piers Gavaston the son of a Gascon knight of some distinction who had honourably served the late King and who in reward of his merits had obtained an establishment for his son in the family of the prince of Wales This young man soon insinuated himself into the affections of his master by his agreeable behaviour and by supplying him with all those innocent tho' frivolous amusements which suited his capacity and his inclinations He was endowed with the utmost elegance of shape and person was noted for a fine mien and easy carriage distinguished himself in all warlike and genteel exercises and was celebrated for those quick sallies of wit by which his country is distinguished By all these accomplishments he gained so entire an ascendant over young Edward whose heart was strongly disposed to friendship and confidence that the late King apprehensive of the consequences had banished him the kingdom and had before he died made his son promise never to recall him  Walsing p Ypod Neust p Trivet cont p  But he no sooner found himself master as he vainly imagined than he sent for Gavaston and even before his arrival at court endowed him with the whole earldom of Cornwal which had escheated to the crown by the death of Edmond son of Richard King of the Romans  Rymer vol p Heming vol p Walsin p Ypod Neust p Trivet cont p  Not content with conferring on him those possessions which had sufficed as an appanage for a prince of the blood he daily loaded him with new honours and riches married him to his own niece sister of the earl of Glocester  Heming vol p Ypod Neust p T de la More p  and seemed to enjoy no pleasure in his royal dignity but as it enabled him to exalt to the highest splendor this object of his fond affections  Discontent of the barons  THE haughty barons offended at the superiority of a minion whose birth tho' reputable they despised as much inferior to their own concealed not their discontent and soon found reasons to justify their animosity in the character and conduct of the man they hated Instead of disarming envy by the moderation and modesty of his behaviour Gavaston displayed his power and influence with the utmost ostentation and deemed no circumstance of his good fortune so agreeable as its enabling him to eclipse and mortify all his rivals He was vainglorious profuse rapacious fond of exterior pomp and appearance giddy with prosperity and as he imagined that his fortune was now as strongly rooted in the kingdom as his ascendant was uncontrouled over the weak monarch he took  no farther care of engaging partizans who might support his sudden and ill established grandeur At all tourneaments he took delight in foiling the English nobility by his superior address In each conversation he made them the object of his wit and raillery Every day his enemies multiplied upon him and nought was wanting but a little time to cement their union and render it fatal both to him and to his master  T de la More p Walsing p    IT behoved the King to take a journey to France both in order to do homage for the dutchy of Guienne and to espouse the princess Isabella to whom he had long been contracted tho' unexpected accidents had hitherto retarded the

o    and on his return with his young queen renewed all the proofs of that fond attachment to his favourite of which every one so loudly complained This princess was of an imperious and intriguing spirit and finding that her husband's capacity required as well as his temper inclined him to be governed she thought herself best intitled on every account to perform the office and she contracted a mortal hatred against the person who had disappointed her in these expectations She was well pleased therefore to see a combination of the nobility forming against Gavaston who sensible of her hatred had wantonly provoked her by new insults and injuries  THOMAS earl of Lancaster cousingerman to the King and first prince of the blood was by far the most opulent and powerful subject in England and possessed in his own right and soon after in that of his wife heiress of the family of Lincoln no less than six earldoms with a proportional estate in land attended with all the jurisdictions and power which commonly in that age were annexed to landed property He was turbulent and factious in his disposition mortally hated the favourite whose influence with the King exceeded his own and he soon became the head of that party among the barons who desired the depression of this insolent stranger The confederated nobles bound themselves by oath to expel Gavaston Both sides began already to put themselves in a warlike posture The licentiousness of the age broke out in robberies and other disorders the usual pre udes of civil war And the royal authority despised in the King's own hands and hated in those of Gavaston became insufficient for the execution of the laws and the maintenance of peace in the kingdom A parliament being summoned at Westminster Lancaster and his party came thither with an armed retinue and  were there enabled to impose their own terms on the sovereign They required the banishment of Gavaston imposed an oath on him never to return and engaged the bishops who never failed to interpose in all civil concerns to pronounce him excommunicate if he remained any longer in the kingdom  Trivet cont p  Edward was obliged to submit  Rymer vol p  but even in his

which had been imposed upon him than unhappy in the absence of his minion employed every expedient to soften the opposition of the barons to his return as if success in that point were the chief object of his government The high office of hereditary steward was conferred on Lancaster His fatherinlaw the earl of Lincoln was bought off by other concessions Earl Warrenne was also mollified by civilities grants or promises The insolence of Gavaston being no longer before men's eyes was less the object of general indignation And Edward deeming matters sufficiently prepared for his purpose applied to the court of Rome and obtained a dispensation from that oath which the barons had compelled Gavaston to take that he would abjure for ever the realm  Rymer vol p  He went down to Chester to receive him on his first landing from Ireland flew into his arms with transports of joy and having obtained the formal consent of the barons in parliament to his reestablishment set no longer any bounds to his extravagant fondness and affection Gavaston himself forgetting his past misfortunes and blind to their causes resumed the same ostentation and insolence and became more than ever the object of general detestation among the barons  THE nobility first discovered their animosity by absenting themselves from parliament and finding that this expedient had not been successful they began to think of employing sharper and more effectual remedies Tho' there had scarce been any other national ground of complaint except some dissipation of the public treasure Tho' all the acts of maladministration objected to the King and his favourite seemed of a nature more proper to excite heart burnings in a ball or assembly than commotions in a great kingdom Yet such was the situation of  the times that the barons were determined and were able to make them the reasons of a total alteration in the constitution and civil government  February  Having come to parliament in defiance of the laws and the King's prohibition with a numerous retinue of armed followers they found themselves entirely masters and presented a petition which was equivalent to a command requiring Edward to devolve on a chosen junto the whole authority both of the crown and of the parliament  th March  The King was obliged to sign a commission empowering the prelates and barons to elect twelve persons who should till the term of Michaelmas in the year following have authority to enact ordinances for the government of the kingdom and the regulation of the King's houshold consenting that these ordinances should thenceforth and for ever have the force of laws and statutes allowing the ordainers to form associations among themselves and their friends for their strict and regular observance and all this for the greater glory of God the security of the church and the honour and advantage of the king and kingdom  Brady's App N  o  Heming vol p Walsing p Ryley p  The barons in return signed a declaration in which they acknowledged that they owed these concessions merely to the King's free bounty promised that this should never be drawn into precedent and engaging that the power of the ordainers should expire at the term appointed  Brady's App N  o      THE chosen junto of twelve accordingly framed their ordinances and presented them to the King and parliament for their confirmation in the ensuing year Some of these ordinances were laudable and tended to the regular execution of justice such as those requiring sheriffs to be men of property abolishing the practices of issuing privy seals for the suspension of justice restraining the practice of purveyance prohibiting the adulteration or alteration of the coin excluding foreigners from the farms of the revenue ordering all payments to be regularly made into the exchequer revoking all late grants of the crown and giving the parties damages in the case of vexatious prosecutions But what chiefly grieved the King was the ordinance for the removal of evil counsellors by which a great number of persons were by name excluded from every office of power and profit and Piers Gavaston himself was for ever banished the King's dominions under the penalty in case of disobedience of being declared a public enemy Other persons more agreeable to the barons were substituted in all the offices And it was ordained that for the future all the considerable dignities in the houshold as well as in the law revenue and military governments should be appointed by the  baronage  in parliament and the power of making  war or assembling his military tenants should no longer be solely vested in the King nor be exercised without the consent of the nobility  EDWARD from the same weakness both of his temper and situation which had engaged him to grant this unlimited commission to the barons was led to give a parliamentary sanction to their ordinances But as a consequence of the same character he  secretly  made a protest against them and declared that since the commission was granted only for the making of ordinances to the advantage of the King and kingdom such articles as should be found prejudicial to both were to be held as not ratified and confirmed  Ryley's Placit Parl p  It is no wonder indeed that he retained a firm purpose to revoke ordinances which had been imposed on him by violence which entirely annihilated the royal authority and above all which deprived him of the company and society of a person whom by an unusual infatuation he valued above all the world and above every other consideration of interest or tranquility  SO soon therefore as Edward removing to York had freed himself from the immediate terror of the baron's power he invited back Gavaston from Flanders which that favourite had made the place of his retreat and declaring his banishment to be illegal and contrary to the laws and customs of the kingdom  Brady's App N  o  Walsing p  openly reinstated him in his former credit and authority  The barons highly provoked at this disappointment and apprehensive of danger to themselves from the declared animosity of so powerful a minion saw that either his or their ruin was now inevitable and they renewed with redoubled zeal their former confederacies against him The earl of Lancaster was a dangerous head of this alliance Guy earl of Warwic entered into it with a furious and precipitate passion Humphrey Bohun earl of Hereford the constable and Aymer de Valence earl of Pembroke brought to it a great accession of power and interest Even earl Warrenne deserted the royal cause which he had hitherto supported and was induced to embrace the side of the confederates  Trivet cont p  And as Robert de Winchelsey archbishop of Canterbury declared himself of the same party he determined the body of the clergy and consequently the people to declare against the King and his minion So predominant at that time was the power of the great nobility that the combination of a few of them was always able to shake the throne and such an universal concurrence became irresistible The earl of Lancaster suddenly raised an army and marched to York where he found the King already removed to Newcastle  Walsing p  He flew thither in pursuit of him  and Edward had just time to escape to Tinmouth where he embarked and sailed with Gavaston to Scarborough He left his favourite in that fortress which had it been properly supplied with provisions was deemed impregnable and he marched forward to York in hopes of raising an army which might be able to support him against his enemies Pembroke was sent by the confederates to besiege the castle of Scarborough  th May  and Gavaston sensible of the bad condition of his garrison was obliged to capitulate with the enemy and surrender himself prisoner  Walsin p  He stipulated that he should remain in Pembroke's hands for two months that endeavours should during that time be mutually used for a general accommodation that if the terms proposed by the barons were not accepted the castle should be restored to him in the same condition as when he surrendered it and that the earl of Pembroke and Henry Piercy should by contract pledge all their lands for the fulfilling of these conditions  Rymer vol p  Pembroke now master of the person of this public enemy conducted him to the castle of Dedington near Banbury where under pretence of other business he left him protected by a a feeble guard  T de la More p  Warwic probably in concert with Pembroke attacked the castle The guards refused to make any resistance Gavaston was yielded up to him and conducted to Warwic castle The earls of Lancaster Hereford and Arundel immediately repaired thither  Dudg Baron vol p    Murder of Gavaston  July  And without any regard either to the laws or the military capitulation they ordered the head of this obnoxious favourite to be struck off by the hands of the executioner  Walsin p T de la More p Trivet cont p    THE King was retired northward to Berwic when he heard of Gavaston's murder and his resentment was proportioned to the affection which he had ever borne him while living He threatened vengeance on all the nobility who had been active in that bloody scene and he made preparations for war in all parts of England But being less constant in his enmities than in his friendships he soon after hearkened to terms of accommodation granted the barons a pardon for all offences and as they stipulated to ask him publicly pardon on their knees  Ryley Rymer vol p  he was so pleased with these vain appearances of exterior submission that he seemed to have sincerely forgiven them all past injuries But as they still pretended notwithstanding their lawless conduct a great anxiety for the maintenance of law and required the establishment of their former ordinances as a necessary security for that purpose Edward told them that he was willing to grant them a free and legal confirmation of such of these ordinances as were not entirely derogatory  to the prerogatives of the crown This answer was received for the present as satisfactory The King's person after the death of Gavaston was now become less obnoxious to the public and as the ordinances insisted on appeared to be nearly the same with those who had been formerly extorted from Henry III by Mountfort and which had been attended with so many fatal consequences they were on that account demanded with less vehemence by the nobility and people The minds of all men seemed to be much appeased towards each other The animosities of faction no longer prevailed And England now united under its head would henceforth be able it was hoped to take vengeance on all its enemies particularly on the Scots whose progress was the object of general resentment and indignation  War with Scotland  IMMEDIATELY after Edward's retreat from Scotland Robert Bruce left his fastnesses in which he intended to have sheltered his feeble force and supplying his defect of power by superior vigour and abilities he made deep impressions on all his enemies foreign and domestic He chaced the lord Argyle and the chieftain of the Macdonalds from their hills and made himself entirely master of the high country He thence invaded with success the Cummins in the low countries of the north He took the castles of Inverness Forfar and Brechin He gained daily some new accession of territory and what was a more important acquisition he daily reconciled the minds of the nobility to his dominion and enlisted under his standard every bold leader whom he enriched by the spoils of his enemies Sir James Douglas in whom commenced the greatness and renown of that warlike family seconded him in all his enterprizes Edward Bruce Robert's own brother distinguished himself by actions of valour And the terror of the English power being now abated by the feeble conduct of the King even the least sanguine of the Scots began to entertain hopes of recovering their independancy and the whole kingdom except a few strong fortresses which he had not the means to attack had acknowleged the authority of Robert  IN this situation Edward found it necessary to grant a truce to Scotland and Robert successfully employed this interval in consolidating his power and introducing order into the civil government disjointed by such a long continuance of war and factions The interval was very short The truce ill observed on both sides was at last openly violated and war recommenced with greater fury than ever Robert not contented with defending himself made successful inroads into England subsisted his needy followers by the plunder of that country and taught them to despise the military genius of a nation who had long been the object of their terror Edward at last rouzed from his lethargy conducted an army into Scotland and Robert determined not to risque too much against an enemy  so much superior retired again into his mountains The King advanced beyond Edinburgh but being destitute of provisions and being ill supported by the English nobility who were then employed in framing their ordinances he was soon obliged to return home without gaining any advantage over the enemy But the appearing union of all the parties in England after the death of Gavaston seemed to restore that kingdom to its native force opened again the prospect of subjecting Scotland and promised a happy conclusion to a war in which both the interests and passions of the nation were so deeply concerned  EDWARD assembled forces from all quarters with a view of finishing by one blow this important enterprize He summoned the most warlike of his vassals from Gascony He inlisted troops from Flanders and other foreign countries He invited over great numbers of the disorderly Irish as to a certain prey He joined to them a body of the Welsh who were actuated by like motives And assembling the whole military force of England he marched to the frontiers with an army which according to the Scots writers amounted to an hundred thousand men but which was probably much inferior to that number  We find in Rymer vol p a list of all the infantry assembled from all parts of England and Wales and they are only It is not likely therefore that the whole army could be near so numerous as is reported    THE army collected by Robert exceeded not thirty thousand combatants but being composed of men who had distinguished themselves by many acts of valour who were rendered desperate by their situation and who were enured to all the varieties of fortune they might justly under such a leader be deemed formidable to the most numerous and best appointed armies The castle of Stirling which with Berwic was the only fortress of Scotland that remained in the hands of the English had been long besieged by Edward Bruce and Philip de Mowbray the governor after an obstinate defence was at last obliged to capitulate and to promise that if before a certain day which was now approaching he was not relieved he should open his gates to the enemy  Rymer vol p  Robert therefore sensible that here was the ground on which he must expect the English chose the field of battle with all the skill and prudence imaginable and made the necessary preparations for their reception He posted himself at Bannockburn about two miles from Stirling where he had a hill on his right flank and a morass on his left And not content with having taken these precautions to prevent his being surrounded by the more numerous army of the English he forsaw the superior strength of the enemy in cavalry and made provisions against it Having a rivulet in front he commanded deep pits to be dug along its  banks and sharp stakes to be planted in them and he ordered the whole to be carefully covered over with turf  T de la More p  The English arrived in sight on the evening and a bloody conflict immediately ensued between two bodies of cavalry where Robert who was at the head of the Scots engaged in single combat with Henry de Bohun a gentleman of the family of Hereford and at one stroke cleft his adversary to the chin with a battle ax in sight of the two armies The English horse fled with precipitation to their main body  THE Scots encouraged by this favourable event and glorying in the valour of their prince prognosticated a happy issue to the combat on the ensuing day The English confident in their numbers and elated with past successes longed for an opportunity of revenge  Battle of Bannockburn  And the night tho' extremely short in that season and in that climate appeared tedious to the impatience of the several combatants  th June  Early in the morning Edward drew out his army and advanced towards the Scots The earl of Glocester his nephew who commanded the left wing of cavalry impelled by the ardour of youth rushed on to the attack without precaution and fell among the covered pits which had been prepared by Bruce for the reception of the enemy  T de la More p  This body of horse was disordered Glocester himself was overthrown and slain Sir James Douglas who commanded the Scottish cavalry gave the enemy no leisure to rally but pushed them off the field with considerable loss and pursued them in sight of their whole line of infantry While the English army were alarmed with this unfortunate beginning of the action which commonly proves decisive they observed an army on the heights towards their left which seemed to be marching leisurely in order to surround them and they were distracted by their multiplied fears This was a number of waggoners and sumpter boys whom Robert had collected together and having supplied them with military standards gave them the appearance at a distance of a formidable army The stratagem took effect A panic seized the English They threw down their arms and fled They were pursued with great slaughter for the space of eighty miles till they reached Berwic And the Scots besides an inestimable booty took many persons of quality prisoners and above gentlemen whom Robert treated with great humanity  Ypod Neust p  and whose ransom was a new accession of wealth to the victorious army The King himself very narrowly escaped by taking shelter in Dunbar whose gates were opened to him by the earl of March and he thence passed by sea to Berwic  SUCH was the great and decisive battle of Bannockburn which secured the independancy of Scotland fixed Bruce on the throne of that kingdom and may be deemed the greatest overthrow which the English monarchy since the conquest  has ever received The numbers of slain on these occasions are always uncertain and are commonly much magnified by the victors But this defeat made a deep impression on the minds of the English and it was remarked that for some years no superiority of numbers could encourage them to keep the field against the Scots  Walsing p  Robert to make advantage of his present success broke into England and ravaged all the northern counties without opposition He besieged Carlisle tho' that place was saved by the valour of Sir Andrew Harcla the governor He was more successful against Berwic which he took by assault  T de la More p Murimuth p  And Robert elated by his continued prosperity entertained hopes of making the most important conquests on the English  He sent over his brother Edward with an army of men into Ireland and that nobleman assumed the title of King of Ireland  Trevet cont p  He followed soon after himself with more numerous forces The horrible and absurd oppressions which the Irish suffered under the English government made them at first fly to the standard of the Scots whom they regarded as their deliverers But a grievous famine which at that time laid desolate both Ireland and Britain reduced the Scottish army to the greatest extremities and Robert was obliged to return with his forces much diminished into his own country His brother after having experienced a variety of fortune was defeated and slain near Dundalk by the English commanded by lord Bermingham  Rymer vol p Walsing p Ypod Neust p T de la More p Trivet cont p  And these projects too extensive for the force of the Scottish nation thus vanished into smoke  THE King besides suffering those disasters from the invasion of the Scots and the insurrection of the Irish was also infested with a rebellion in Wales  Rymer vol p  and above all by the factions of his own nobility who took advantage of the public calamities insulted his fallen fortunes and endeavoured to establish their own independance on the ruins of the throne Lancaster and the barons of his party who had declined attending Edward on his Scottish expedition no sooner saw him return with disgrace than they insisted on the renewal of their ordinances which they still pretended to have validity and the King's unhappy condition obliged him to submit to their demands The ministry was new modeled by the direction of Lancaster  Ryley p Rymer vol p  That nobleman was placed at the head of the council It was declared that all the offices should be filled from time to time by the votes of parliament or rather by the will of the great barons  Brady vol p from the records app No Ryley p  And the nation under this new model of government endeavoured to put itself in a better  posture of defence against the Scots But the factious nobles were far from being terrified with the progress of these public enemies On the contrary they founded the hopes of their own future grandeur on the weakness and distresses of the crown Lancaster himself was suspected with great appearance of reason of holding a secret correspondence with the King of Scots And tho' he was himself entrusted with the command of the English armies he took care that every enterprize should be disappointed and every plan of operations prove unsuccessful  ALL the European kingdoms especially that of England were at this time totally unacquainted with the office of a prime minister so well understood at present in all regular monarchies and the people could form no conception of a man who tho' still in the rank of a subject possessed all the power of a sovereign eased the prince of the burthen of affairs supplied his want of experience or capacity and maintained all the rights of the crown without degrading the greatest nobles by their submission to his temporary authority Edward was plainly by nature unfit to hold himself the reins of government He had no vices but was unhappy in a total incapacity for serious business He was sensible of his own defects and necessarily sought to be governed Yet every favourite whom he successively chose was regarded as a fellow subject exalted above his rank and station He was the object of envy to the great nobility His character and conduct were decryed with the people His authority over the king and kingdom was considered as an usurpation and unless the prince had embraced the dangerous expedient of devolving his power on the earl of Lancaster or some mighty barons whose family interest was so extensive as to be able alone to maintain his influence he could expect no peace nor tranquillity upon the throne  Hugh le D'espenser  THE King's chief favourite after the death of Gavaston was Hugh le D'espenser or Spenser a young man of English birth of high rank and of a noble family  Dugd Baron vol p  He possessed all the exterior accomplishments of person and address which were fitted to engage the weak mind of Edward but was devoid of that moderation and prudence which might have qualified him to mitigate the envy of the great and conduct him thro' all the perils of that dangerous station to which he was advanced His father who was of the same name and who by means of his son had also attained great influence over the King was a noble man venerable from his years respected thro' all his past life for wisdom  lour and integrity and well fitted by his talents and experience could  have admitted of any temperament to have supplied the defects both of the  and of his minion  T de la More p  But no sooner was Edward's attachment declared for young Spenser than the turbulent Lancaster and most of the great barons regarded him as their rival made him the object of their animosity and formed violent plans for his ruin  Walsing p T de la More p Murimuth p  They first declared their discontent by withdrawing from parliament and it was not long ere they found a pretence for proceeding to greater extremities against him  Civil commotions  THE King who set no limits to his bounty towards his minions had married the younger Spenser to his niece one of the coheirs of the earl of Glocester slain at Bannockburn and the favourite by his succession to that opulent family had inherited great possessions in the marches of Wales  Trivet cont p  and being desirous of extending still farther his influence in those quarters he is accused of having committed injustice towards the barons of Audley and D'ammori who had also married two sisters of the same family There was likewise a baron in that neighbourhood called William de Braouse lord of Gower who had made a settlement of his estate on John de Mowbray his son in law and in case of failure of that nobleman and his issue had substituted the earl of Hereford in the succession to the barony of Gower Mowbray on the decease of his father in law entered immediately into possession of the estate without the formality of taking livery and seizin from the crown and Spenser who coveted that barony persuaded the King to put in execution the rigor of the feudal law to seize Gower as escheated to the crown and to confer it upon him  Mon  Malmes  This transaction which was the proper subject of a lawsuit immediately excited a civil war in the kingdom The earls of Lancaster and Hereford flew to arms Audley and D'ammori joined them with all their forces The two Rogers de Mortimer and Roger de Clifford with many others disgusted for private reasons with the Spensers brought a considerable accession to the party And their army being now formidable they sent a message to the King requiring him immediately to dismiss or confine the younger Spenser and menacing him in case of refusal with renouncing their homage and allegiance to him and taking revenge on that minister by their own authority They scarce waited for an answer but immediately fell upon the lands of young Spenser which they pillaged and destroyed murdered his servants drove off his cattle and burned his houses  Murimuth p  They proceeded thence to commit like devastations on the estates of Spenser the father whose character hitherto they had seemed to respect And having drawn and signed a formal  association among themselves  Tyrrel vol p from the register of C C Canterbury  they marched up to London with all their forces stationed themselves in the neighbourhood of that city and demanded of the King the banishment of both the Spensers These noblemen were then absent the father abroad the son at sea and both of them employed in different commissions The King therefore replied that his coronation oath by which he was bound to observe the laws restrained him from giving his assent to so illegal a demand or condemning noblemen who were accused of no crime nor had any opportunity afforded them of making answer  Walsing p  Equity and reason were but a feeble opposition to men who had arms in their hands and who being already involved in guilt saw no safety but in success and victory They entered London with their troops and giving in to the parliament which was then sitting a charge against the Spensers of which they attempted not to prove one article they procured by menaces and violence a sentence of perpetual exile and forfeiture against these ministers  Totle's collect part p Walsing p  This sentence was voted by the lay barons alone For the commons tho' now an estate in parliament were yet of so little consideration that their assent was never demanded and even the voice of the prelates was neglected amidst the present disorders The only symptom which these turbulent barons gave of their regard to law was their requiring from the King an indemnity for their illegal proceedings  Tottle's collect part p Rymer vol p  after which they disbanded their army and separated in security as they imagined to their several castles  THIS act of violence in which the King was obliged to acquiesce rendered his person and his authority so contemptible that every one thought himself entitled to treat him with neglect The queen having occasion soon after to pass by the castle of Leeds in Kent which belonged to the lord Badlesmere desired a night's lodging but was refused admittance and some of her attendants who presented themselves at the gate were killed  Rymer vol p Walsing p T de la More p Murimuth p  The insult and brutality towards this princess who had always endeavoured to live on good terms with the barons and who joined them heartily in their hatred of the younger Spenser was an action which no body pretended to vindicate and the King thought that he might without giving general umbrage assemble an army and take vengeance on the offender No one came to the assistance of Badlesmere and Edward prevailed  Walsing p  But having now some forces on foot and having concerted measures with his friends throughout England he ventured to take off the mask to attack all his enemies and to recal the two Spensers whose sentence he declared  illegal unjust contrary to the tenor of the great charter passed without the assent of the prelates and extorted by violence from him and the estate of barons  Rymer vol p T de la More p    Still the commons were not mentioned by either party  THE King had now got the start of his adversaries an advantage which in those times was commonly decisive And hastened with his army to the marches of Wales the chief seat of the enemies power whom he found totally unprepared for resistance Many of the barons in those parts endeavoured to appease him by submission  Walsing p Murimuth p  Their castles were seized and their persons committed to custody But Lancaster in order to prevent the total ruin of his party summoned together all his vassals and retainers declared his alliance with Scotland which had long been suspected received the promise of a reinforcement from that country under the command of Randolf earl of Murray and Sir James Douglas  Rymer vol p  and being joined by the earl of Hereford advanced with all his forces against the King who had collected an army of men and was superior to his enemies Lancaster posted himself at Burton upon Trent and endeavoured to defend the passages of the river  Walsing p  But being disappointed in that plan of operations this nobleman who had no military genius and whose personal courage was even suspected fled with his army to the north in expectation of being there joined by his Scottish allies  Ypod Neust p  He was pursued by the King and his army diminished daily till he came to Boroughbridge where he found Sir Andrew Harcla posted with some forces on the opposite side of the river and ready to dispute the passage with him  th March  He was repulsed in an attempt which he made to force his way the earl of Hereford was killed the whole army of the rebels was disconcerted Lancaster himself was become incapable of taking any measures either for flight or defence and he was seized without resistance by Harcla and conducted to the King  T de la More p Walsing p  In those violent times the laws were so much neglected on both sides that even where they might without any sensible inconvenience have been observed the conquerors deemed it unnecessary to pay any regard to them Lancaster who was guilty of open rebellion and was taken in arms against his sovereign instead of being tried by the laws of his country which pronounced the sentence of death against him was condemned by a courtmartial  Tyrrel vol p from the Records  and led to execution  d March Execution of the earl of Lancaster  Edward however little vindictive in his natural temper here indulged his revenge and practised against the prisoner the same indignities which had been exercised by his orders against Gavaston He was  cloathed in a

of his own castles and there beheaded  Leland's Coll vol p    THUS perished Thomas earl of Lancaster the first prince of the blood and one of the most potent barons who had ever been in England His public conduct sufficiently discovers the violence and turbulency of his character His private deportment appears not to have been more innocent  Knyghton p  And his hypocritical devotion by which he gained the favour of the monks and populace will rather be regarded as an aggravation than an alleviation of his guilt  Hidgen lib cap    Badlesmere Giffard Barret Cheyney Fleming and about eighteen

treasonable correspondence with the King of Scotland  Rymer vol p vol p Walsing p Ypod Neust p  But the greatest part of all those vast escheats was seized by young Spenser whose rapacity was insatiable  Dudg vol p  Many of the barons of the King's party were disgusted with this partial division of the spoils The envy against Spenser rose higher than ever The usual insolence of his temper raised by success impelled him to commit many acts of violence  Dudg vol p T de la More p  The people who always hated him made him still more the object of their aversion All the relations of the attainted barons and gentlemen secretly vowed revenge And tho' tranquility was in appearance restored to the kingdom the general contempt of the King and odium against Spenser bred dangerous humours the source of future revolutions and convulsions  IN this situation no success could be expected from foreign wars and Edward after making one more fruitless attempt against Scotland whence he retreated with dishonour found it necessary to terminate hostilities with that kingdom by a truce of thirteen years  Rymer vol p  Murimuth p  Robert tho' his title to the crown was not acknowledged in the treaty was satisfied with ensuring his possession of it during so long a time He had repelled with gallantry all the attacks of England He had successfully carried war both into that kingdom and into Ireland He had rejected  with disdain the Pope's authority who pretended to impose his commands upon him and oblige him to make peace with his enemies  His throne was firmly established as well in the affections of his subjects as by force of arms Yet there naturally remained some inquietude in his mind while at war with a state which however at present disordered by faction was of itself so much an overmatch for him both in riches and in numbers of people And this truce was at the same time the more convenient for England because the nation was in that juncture threatened with hostiliteis from France  PHILIP the Fair King of France who died in had left the crown to his son Lewis Hutin who after a short reign dying without male issue was succeeded by Philip the Long his brother whose death soon after made way for Charles the Fair the youngest brother of that family This monarch had some reasons of complaint against the King's ministers in Guienne and as there was no common nor equitable judge in that strange species of sovereignty established by the feudal law he seemed desirous to take advantage of Edward's weakness and under that pretence to confiscate all his foreign dominions  Rymer vol p  After an embassy by the earl of Kent the King's brother had been tried in vain Queen Isabella obtained permission to go over to Paris and endeavour to adjust in an amicable manner the difference with her brother  Rymer vol p Murimuth p  But while she was making some progress in this negotiation Charles started a new pretension the justice of which could not be disputed that Edward himself should appear in his court and do the homage of a vassal for the fees which he held in France  T de la More p Walsin p Ypod Neust p Murimuth p  But there occurred many difficulties in complying with this demand Young Spenser by whom the King was implicitly governed had unavoidably been engaged in many quarrels with the Queen who aspired to the same authority and tho' that artful princess on her leaving England had dissembled her animosity  Rymer vol p  Spenser well acquainted with her secret sentiments was unwilling to attend his master to Paris and appear in a court where her credit might expose him to insults if not to danger He hesitated no less on allowing the King to make the journey alone both fearing lest that easy prince should in his absence fall under some other influence and foreseeing the perils to which he himself should be exposed if without the protection of the royal authority he remained in England where he was so generally hated  While these doubts bred delays and difficulties Isabella proposed that Edward should resign the dominion of Guienne to his son now thirteen  years of age and that the prince should come to Paris and do the homage which every vassal owed to his superior lord  Rymer vol p Walsin p T de la More p Murimuth p  This expedient which seemed so happily to remove all difficulties was immediately complied with Spenser was charmed with the contrivance Young Edward was sent to Paris And the ruin covered under this fatal snare was never perceived nor suspected by any of the English council  THE Queen on her arrival in France had found there a great number of English fugitives the remains of the Lancastrian faction and their common hatred of Spenser soon bred a secret friendship and correspondence between them and that princess Among the rest was young Roger Mortimer a potent baron in the Welsh marches who had been obliged with others to make his submission to the King had been condemned for high treason but having received a pardon for his life was afterwards detained in the Tower with an intention of rendering his imprisonment perpetual He was so fortunate as to make his escape into France  Rymer vol p T de la More p Walsing p Ypod Neust p  and being one of the most considerable persons now remaining of the party as well as distinguished by his violent animosity against Spenser he was easily admitted to pay his court to Queen Isabella The graces of his person and address advanced him quickly in her affections He became her confident and counsellor in all her measures And gaining daily ground upon her heart he engaged her to sacrifice at last to her passion all the sentiments of honour and of fidelity to her husband  T de la More p Murimuth p    Conspiracy against the King  Hating now the man whom she had injured and whom she never valued she entered cordially into all Mortimer's conspiracies and having artfully got into her hands the young prince and heir of the monarchy she resolved on the utter ruin of the King as well as of his favourite She engaged her brother to enter into this criminal purpose Her court was daily full of the exiled barons Mortimer lived in the most declared intimacy with her A correspondence was secretly carried on with the malecontent party in England And when Edward informed of these alarming circumstances required her speedily to return with the prince she publicly replied that she never would set foot in the kingdom till Spenser was forever removed from his presence and councils A declaration which procured her great popularity in England and threw a decent veil on all her treasonable enterprizes  EDWARD endeavoured to put himself in a posture of defence  Rymer vol p  but besides the difficulties arising from his own indolence and slender abilities and the want of authority which of consequence attended all his resolutions it was not easy  for him in the present state of the kingdom and revenue to maintain a constant force ready to repell an invasion which he knew not at what time or place he had reason to expect  Insurrection  All his efforts were unequal to the traiterous and hostile conspiracies which both at home and abroad were forming against his authority and which were daily penetrating farther even into his own family His brother the earl of Kent a virtuous but weak prince who was then at Paris was unwarily engaged by his sisterin law and by the King of France who was also his cousin german to give countenance to the invasion whose sole object he believed was the expulsion of the Spensers He prevailed on his elder brother the earl of Norfolk to enter secretly into the same design The brother and heir of the earl of Lancaster had too many reasons for his hatred of these ministers to refuse his concurrence Walter de Reynel archbishop of Canterbury and many of the prelates expressed their approbation of the Queen's measures Several of the most potent barons envying the exorbitant authority of the favourite were ready to fly to arms The minds of the people by means of some truths and many calumnies were strongly disposed to the same party And there needed but the appearance of the Queen and Prince with such a body of foreign troops as might be sufficient to give her protection against immediate violence to turn all this tempest so artfully prepared against the unhappy Edward  CHARLES tho' he gave countenance and assistance to the faction was ashamed openly to support the Queen and prince against the authority of a husband and father and Isabella was obliged to court the alliance of some other foreign potentate from whose dominions she might set out on her intended enterprize For this purpose she affianced young Edward whose tender age made him incapable to judge of the consequences with Philippa daughter of the count of Holland and Hainault  T de la More p  and having by the open assistance of this prince and the secret protection of her brother

sooner discovered his weakness by leaving the city than the rage of the populace broke out without controul against him and his ministers They first plundered and then murdered all those who were

dethroned  THE queen to avail herself of the prevailing delusion summoned in the King's name a parliament at Westminster where together with the power of her army and the authority of her partizans among the barons who were concerned to secure their past treasons by committing new acts of violence against their sovereign she expected to be seconded by the fury of the populace the most dangerous of all instruments and the least answerable for their excesses  th January  A charge was drawn up against the King in which even tho' it was framed by his inveterate enemies nothing but his narrow genius or his misfortunes were objected to him For the greatest malice found no particular crime with which it could reproach this unhappy prince He was accused of incapacity for government of wasting his time in idle amusements of neglecting public business of being swayed by evil counsellors of having lost by his misconduct the kingdom of Scotland and part of Guienne and to swell the charge even the death of some barons and the imprisonment of some prelates convicted of treason were laid to  account  Knyghton p  Brady's App No  It was in vain amidst the violence of arms and tumult of the

placed on the throne And a deputation was sent to Edward at Kenilworth to require his resignation which menaces and terror soon extorted from him  BUT it was impossible that the people however corrupted by the barbarity of the times still farther enflamed by faction could forever remain insensible to the voice of nature A wife who had first deserted next invaded and then dethroned her husband Who had made her infant son an instrument in this unnatural treatment of his father Who had by lying pretences seduced the nation into rebellion against their sovereign Who had pushed them into violences and cruelties that had dishonoured them All those circumstances were so odious in themselves and formed such a complicated scene of guilt that the least reflection sufficed to open mens eyes and make them detest this flagrant infringement of every public and private duty The suspicions which soon arose of Isabella's criminal commerce with Mortimer the proofs which daily broke out of this part of her guilt encreased the general abhorrence against her and her impudent hypocrisy in publicly bewailing with tears the King's unhappy fate  Walsing p  was not able to deceive even the most stupid and most prejudiced of her adherents In proportion as the Queen became the object of public hatred the dethroned monarch who had been the victim of her crimes and her ambition was regarded with pity with friendship with veneration and men became sensible that all his misconduct which faction had so much exaggerated had been owing to the unavoidable weakness not to any voluntary depravity of his character The new earl of Lancaster to whose custody he had been committed was soon touched with these generous sentiments and besides using his prisoner with gentleness and humanity he was suspected to have entertained still more honourable intentions in his favour The King therefore was taken out of his hands and delivered over to the lord Berkeley and Mautravers and Gournay who were entrusted alternately each for a month with the charge of guarding him While he was in Berkeley's custody he was still used with the gentleness due to his rank and his misfortunes but when Mautravers' and Gournay's turn came every species of indignity was practised against him as if their intention had been to break entirely the prince's spirit and to employ his sorrows and afflictions instead of more violent and more dangerous expedients for the instruments of his murder  Anonymi Hist p  It is reported that one day when Edward was to be shaved they ordered cold and dirty water to be brought form the ditch for that purpose and when he desired it to be changed and was still denied his request he burst out into tears which bedewed his cheeks and he exclaimed that in spite of their insolence he should be shaved with clean and warm water  T de la More p  But as this means for laying Edward in his grave appeared still too slow to the impatient Mortimer he secretly sent orders to the  two keepers who were at his devotion instantly to dispatch him and these ruffians contrived to make the manner of his death as cruel and barbarous as possible  st Septr  Taking

prevent any discovery which he might make of his accomplices  Walsing p Anon Hist p  Mautravers concealed himself for several years in Germany but having found means of rendering some service to Edward III he ventured to approach his person threw himself on his knees before him submitted to his mercy and received a pardon  Cotton's abridg p Rymer vol p    His character  IT is not easy to imagine a man more innocent and inoffensive than the unhappy King whose tragical death we have related nor a prince less fitted for governing that fierce and turbulent people subjected to his authority He was obliged to devolve on others the weight of government which he had neither ability nor inclination to bear The same indolence and want of penetration led him to make choice of ministers and favourites who were not always the best qualified for the trust committed to them The seditious grandees pleased with his weakness yet complaining of it under pretence of attacking his ministers insulted his person and invaded his authority And the impatient populace ignorant of the source of their grievances threw all the blame upon the King and encreased the public disorders by their faction and violence It was in vain to look  for protection from the laws whose voice always feeble in those times was not heard amidst the din of arms What could not defend the King was less able to give shelter to any of the people The whole machine of government was torne in pieces with fury and violence And men instead of complaining against the manners of their age and the form of their constitution which required the most steady and most skilful hand to conduct them imputed all errors to the person who had the misfortune to be entrusted with the reins of empire  BUT tho' such mistakes be natural and unavoidable while the events are recent it is a shameful delusion in modern historians to imagine that all the antient princes who were unfortunate in their government were also tyrannical in their conduct and that the seditions of the people proceeded always from some invasion of their liberties and privileges by the monarch Even a great and a good King was not in that age secure against faction and rebellion as appears in the case of Henry II but a great King had the best chance as we learn from the history of the same period for quelling and subduing them Compare the reigns and characters of Edward I and II The father made several violent attempts against the liberties of the people His barons opposed him He was obliged at least found it prudent to submit But as they dreaded his valour and abilities they were contented with reasonable satisfaction and pushed no farther their advantages against him The facility and weakness of the son not his violence threw every thing into confusion The laws and government were overturned An attempt to reinstate them was an unpardonable crime And no atonement but the deposition and tragical death of the King himself could give these barons contentment It is easy to see that a constitution which depended so much on the personal character of the sovereign must necessarily in many of its parts be a government of will not of laws But always to throw without distinction the blame of all disorders upon the prince would introduce a fatal error in politics and serve as a perpetual apology for treason and rebellion As if the turbulency of the great and madness of the people were not equally with the tyranny of princes an evil incident to human society and no less carefully to be guarded against in every well regulated constitution  Miscellaneous transactions during this reign  WHILE these abominable scenes passed in England the theatre of France was stained with a wickedness equally barbarous and still more public and deliberate The order of knights templars had arisen during the first fervour of the Croisades and uniting the two qualities the most popular in that age devotion and valour and exercising both in the most popular of all enterprizes the defence of the Holy Land they had made rapid advances to credit and authority and  had acquired from the piety of the faithful very ample possessions in every country of Europe especially in France Their great riches joined to the course of time had by degrees relaxed the severity of these virtues and the templars had in a great measure lost that popularity which first raised them to honour and distinction Acquainted from experience with the fatigues and dangers of those fruitless expeditions to the East they chose rather to enjoy in ease their opulent revenues in Europe And being all of them men of birth educated according to the custom of that age without any tincture of letters they scorned the ignoble occupations of a monastic life and passed their time wholly in the fashionable amusements of hunting gallantry and the pleasures of the table Their rival order that of St John of Jerusalem whose poverty had as yet preserved them from like corruptions still distinguished themselves by their enterprizes against the infidels and succeeded to all the popularity which was lost by the indolence and luxury of the templars But tho' these causes had weakened the foundations of this order once so celebrated and revered the immediate source of their destruction proceeded from the cruel and vindictive spirit of Philip the Fair who having entertained a private disgust against some eminent templars determined to gratify at once his avidity and revenge by involving the whole order in one undistinguished ruin On no better information than that of two knights condemned by their superiors to perpetual imprisonment for their vices and profligacy he ordered on one day all the templars of France to be committed to prison and imputed to them such enormous and absurd crimes as are sufficient of themselves to destroy all the credit of the accusation Besides their being universally charged with murder robbery and vices the most shocking to nature every one it was pretended whom they received into their order was obliged to renounce our Saviour to spit upon the cross  Rymer vol  p    and to join to this impiety the superstition of worshiping a gilded head which was secretly kept in one of their houses at Marseilles They also initiated it was said every candidate by such infamous rites as could serve to no other purpose than to degrade the order in his eyes and destroy for ever the authority of all his superiors over him  It was pretended that he kissed the knights who received him on the mouth navel and breech Dupuy p Wals p  Above an hundred of these unhappy gentlemen were put to the question in order to extort from them a confession of their guilt The more obstinate perished in the hands of their tormentors Several to procure themselves immediate ease in the violence of their agonies acknowledged whatever was required of them Forged confessions were imputed to others  Vertot hist de Chev de Ma  vol p c  And Philip as if their guilt were now certain  proceeded to a confiscation of all their treasures But no sooner had the templars recovered from their tortures than preferring the most cruel execution to a life with infamy they disavowed their confessions exclaimed against the sorgeries justified the innocence of their order and appealed to all the gallant actions performed by them in antient or latter times as a full apology for their conduct The barbarous tyrant enraged at this disappointment and thinking himself now engaged in honour to proceed to extremities ordered fifty four of them whom he branded as relapsed heretics to perish by the punishment of fire in his capital  Vertot vol p Trevet cont p  Great numbers expired after a like manner in other parts of the kingdom And when he found that the perseverance of these unhappy victims in justifying to the last their innocence had made deep impression on the spectators he endeavoured to overcome the constancy of the templars by new inhumanities The grand master of the order John de Molay and another great officer brother to the sovereign of Dauphiné were conducted to a scaffold erected before the church of Notredame at Paris A full pardon was offered them on the one hand The fire destined for their execution was shown to them on the other These gallant nobles still persisted in the protestations of their own innocence and that of their order and were instantly hurried into the flames by the executioner  Vertot vol p    IN all this barbarous injustice Clement V who was the creature of Philip and then resided in France fully concurred and without examining a witness or making any enquiry into the truth of facts he summarily by the plenitude of his apostolic power abolished the whole order The templars all over Europe were thrown into prison their conduct underwent a strict scrutiny the power of their enemies still pursued and oppressed them but no where except in France were the smallest traces of their guilt pretended to be found England sent back an ample testimony of their piety and morals but as the order was now annihilated the knights were distributed into several convents and their possessions were by command of the Pope transferred to the order of St John  Rymer vol p vol p Ypod Neust p  We now proceed to relate some other detached transactions of the present period  THE kingdom of England was afflicted with a grievous famine during several years of this reign Perpetual rains and cold weather not only destroyed the harvest but bred a mortality among the cattle and raised every kind of food to an enormous price  Trevet cont p  The parliament in endeavoured to fix more moderate rates on commodities not sensible that such an attempt was impracticable and that were it possible to reduce the price of food by any other expedient  than introducing plenty nothing could be more pernicious and destructive to the public Where the produce of a year for instance falls so far short as to afford full subsistance only for nine months the only expedient for making it last the whole twelve is to raise the prices to put the people by that means on short allowance and oblige them to spare their food till a more plentiful year But in reality the encrease of prices is a necessary consequence of scarcity and laws instead of preventing it only encrease the evil by cramping and restraining commerce The parliament accordingly in the ensuing year repealed their ordinance which they had found useless and burdensome  Wals p    THE prices affixed by the parliament are somewhat remarkable Two pounds eight shillings of our present money for the best ox not fed with corn If fed with corn three pounds twelve shillings A fat hog of two years old ten shillings A fat weather unshorn a crown If shorn three shillings and six pence A fat goose seven pence halfpenny A fat capon sixpence A fat hen three pence Two chickens three pence Four pigeons three pence Two dozen of eggs three pence  Rot Parl Edw II n Ypod Neust p  If we consider these prices we shall find that butcher's meat in this time of great scarcity must still have been sold by the parliamentary ordinance three times cheaper than our middling prices at present Poultry somewhat lower because being now considered as a delicacy it has risen beyond its proportion In the country places of Ireland and Scotland where delicacies bear no price poultry is at present as cheap if not cheaper than butcher's meat But the inference I would draw from the comparison of prices is still more considerable I suppose that the rates affixed by parliament were inferior to the usual market prices in those years of famine and mortality of cattle and that these commodities instead of a third had really risen to a half of the present value But the famine at that time was so consuming that wheat was sometimes sold for above four pounds ten shillings a quarter  Murimuth p Walsingham p says it rose to six pounds  usually for three pounds  Ypod Neust p Trivet cont p  that is considerably above twice our middling prices A certain proof of the wretched state of tillage in those ages We formerly found that the middling price of corn in that period was a half of the present value while the middling price of cattle was only an eighth part We here find the same immense disproportion in years of scarcity It may thence be inferred with certainty that the raising of corn was a species of manufactory which few in that age could practise with advantage And there is reason to think that other manufactures more refined were sold even beyond their present prices At least there is a demonstration for it in the reign of Henry  VII from the prices affixed to scarlet and other broad cloaths by act of parliament During all those times it was usual for the princes and great nobility to make settlements of their velvet beds and silken robes in the same manner as of their estates and manors  Dugdale pa m  In the list of jewels and plate which had belonged to the ostentatious Gavaston and which the King recovered from the earl of Lancaster after the murder of that favourite we find some embroidered girdles flowered shirts and silk waistcoats  Rymer vol p  It was afterwards one article of accusation against that potent and opulent earl when tried for his life that he had purloined some of these effects of Gavaston The ignorance of those ages in manufactures and especially in tillage is a clear proof that they were far from being populous  ALL trade and manufactures indeed were then at a very low ebb The only country in the northern parts of Europe where they seem to have risen to any tolerable degree of improvement was Flanders When Robert earl of that country was applied to by Edward and was desired to break off commerce with the Scots whom Edward called his rebels and represented as excommunicated on that account by the church the earl replied that Flanders was always considered as common and free and open to all nations  Rymer vol p    THE petition of the elder Spenser to parliament complaining of the devastation committed on his lands by the barons contains several particulars which are curious and discover the manners of the age  Brady's hist vol p from Claus Edw II M Dors in cedula  He affirms that they had ravaged sixty three manors belonging to him and he makes his losses amount to pounds that is to of our present money Among other particulars he enumerates sheep oxen and heifers cows with their breed for two years cart horses hogs together with bacons carcasses of beef and muttons in the larder ten tuns of cyder arms for men and other warlike engines and provisions The plain inference is that the greatest part of Spenser's vast estate as well as that of the other nobility was farmed by the landlord himself managed by his stewards or bailiffs and cultivated by his villains Little or none of it was let on lease to husbandmen Its produce was consumed in rustic hospitality by the baron or his officers A great number of idle retainers ready for any disorder or mischief were maintained by him All who lived upon his estate were absolutely at his disposal Instead of applying to courts of justice he usually sought redress by open force and violence The great nobility were a kind of independant potentates who if they submitted to any regulations at all were less governed by the municipal  law than by a rude species of the laws of nations The method in which we find they treated the King's favourites and ministers is a proof of their usual way of dealing with each other A party which complains of the arbitrary conduct of ministers ought naturally to affect a great regard for the laws and constitution and maintain at least the appearance of justice in their proceedings Yet these barons when discontented came to parliament with an armed force constrained the King to assent to their measures and without any trial or witness or conviction passed from the pretended notoriety of facts an act of banishment or attainder against the minister which on the first revolution of fortune was reversed by like expedients The parliament during factious times was nothing but the organ of present power Tho' the persons of whom it was chiefly composed seemed to enjoy great independance they really possessed no true liberty and the security of each individual among them was not so much derived from the general protection of law as from his own private power and that of his confederates The authority of the monarch tho' far from absolute was very irregular and might often reach him The current of a faction might easily overwhelm him A hundred considerations of benefits and injuries friendships and animosities hopes and fears were able to influence his conduct and amidst these motives a regard to equity and law and justice was commonly in those rude ages of little moment Nor did any man entertain thoughts of opposing present power who did not deem himself strong enough to dispute the field with it by force and was not prepared to give battle to the sovereign or the ruling party  BEFORE I conclude this reign I cannot forbear making another remark drawn from the detail of losses given in by the elder Spenser particularly the great quantity of salt meat which he had in his larder bacons carcasses of beef muttons We may observe that the outrage of which he complains began after the third of May as we learn from the same paper It is easy therefore to conjecture what a vast store of the same kind he must have laid up at the beginning of winter and we may draw a new conclusion with regard to the wretched state of the antient husbandry which could not provide any subsistance for the cattle during winter even in such a temperate climate as the south of England For Spenser had but one manor so far north as Yorkshire There being few or no enclosures except perhaps for deer no sown grass little hay and no other resources for feeding cattle the barons as well as the people were obliged to kill and salt their oxen and sheep at the beginning of winter before they became lean upon the common pasture A precaution still practised with regard to oxen in the least cultivated parts of this island The salting of mutton  is a miserable expedient which has every where been long disused From this circumstance however trivial in appearance may be drawn very important inferences with regard to the domestic oeconomy and manner of life in those ages  THE disorders of the times from foreign wars and intestine dissentions but above all the cruel famine which obliged the nobility to dismiss many of their retainers encreased the number of robbers in the kingdom and no place was secure from their incursions  Ypod Neust p Wals p  They met in troops like armies and overran the country Two cardinals themselves the Pope's legates notwithstanding the numerous train which attended them were robbed and despoiled

affected with leprosy a disease at that time very common had conspired with the Saracens to poison all the springs and fountains and men being glad of any pretence to get rid of those who were a

their future security to pay so far an exterior obeisance to the law as to demand a parliamentary indemnity for all their illegal proceedings on account of the necessity which it was pretended they lay under of employing force against the Spensers and other evil counsellors the enemies of the kingdom All the attainders also which had passed against the earl of Lancaster and his adherents when the chance of war turned against them were easily reversed during the triumph of their party  Rymer vol p c  and the Spensers whose former attainder had been reversed by parliament were now again in this change of fortune condemned by the votes of their enemies A council of regency was likewise appointed by parliament consisting of twelve persons five prelates the archbishops of Canterbury and York the bishops of Winchester Worcester and Hereford and seven lay peers the earls of Norfolk Kent and Surrey and the lords Wake Ingham Piercy and Ross The earl of Lancaster was appointed guardian and protector of the King's person But tho' it was reasonable to expect that as the weakness of the former King had given reins to the licentiousness of the barons great tranquillity would not prevail during the present minority the first disturbance arose from the invasion of foreign enemies  War with Scotland  THE King of Scots declining in years and health but retaining still that martial spirit which had raised his nation from the lowest ebb of fortune deemed  the present opportunity favourable for infesting England He first made an attempt on the castle of Norham in which he was disappointed he then collected an army of men on the frontiers and having appointed the earl of Murray and lord Douglas generals threatened an incursion into the northern counties The English regency after trying in vain every expedient to restore peace with Scotland made vigorous preparations for war and besides assembling an English army of near sixty thousand men they invited back John de Hainault and some foreign cavalry whom they had dismissed and whose discipline and arms had appeared superior to those of their own country Young Edward himself burning with a passion for military fame appeared at the head of these numerous forces and marched from Durham the appointed place of rendevous in quest of the enemy who had already broke into the frontiers and were laying every thing waste around him with fire and sword  MURRAY and Douglas were the two most celebrated warriors bred in the long hostilities between the Scots and English and their forces trained in the same school and enured to hardships fatigues and dangers were perfectly qualified by their habits and manner of life for that desultory and destructive war which they carried on against the English Except a body of about cavalry well armed and fit to make a steddy impression in battle the rest of the army were mounted on small horses which found subsistance every where and carried them with rapid and unexpected marches whether they meant to commit depredations on the peaceable inhabitants or to attack an armed enemy or to retreat into their own country The whole equipage of the troops consisted of a bag of oat meal which as a supply in case of necessity each soldier carried behind him together with a light plate of iron on which he instantly baked the oat meal into a cake in the open fields But his chief subsistance was the cattle which he seized and his cookery was as expeditious as all his other operations After fleaing the animal he placed the skin loose and hanging in the form of a bag upon some stakes he poured water into it kindled a fire below and thus made it serve as a cauldron for the boiling of his victuals  Froissard liv chap    THE chief difficulty which Edward met with after composing some dangerous frays which broke out between his foreign forces and the English  Froissard liv chap  was to come up with an enemy so rapid in their marches and so little encumbered in their motions Tho' the flame and smoke of burning villages directed him sufficiently to the place of their encampment he found upon hurrying thither that they were already departed and he soon discovered by new marks of devastation that they had removed to some distant quarter After harrassing his army during  some time in this fruitless chace he advanced northwards and crossed the Tyne with a resolution of awaiting them on their return homewards and taking vengeance on them for all their depredations  Froissart liv chap  But that whole country was already so much wasted by their frequent incursions that it could not afford subsistance to his army and he was obliged again to return southwards and change his plan of operations He had now lost all tract of the enemy and tho' he promised the reward of a hundred pounds a year to any one who should bring him an account of their motions he remained unactive some days before he received any intelligence of them  Rymer vol p Froissart liv chap  He found at last that they had fixed their camp on the southern banks of the Were as if they intended to await a battle but their prudent leaders had chosen the ground with such judgment that the English on their approach found it impracticable without temerity to cross the river in their face and attack them in their present situation Edward impatient for revenge and glory here sent them a defiance and challenged them if they dared to meet him in an equal field and try the fortune of arms The bold spirit of Douglas could ill brook this bravado and he advised the acceptance of the challenge but he was overruled by Murray who replied to Edward that he never took the council of an enemy in any of his operations The King therefore kept still his position opposite to them and expected daily that necessity would oblige them to change their quarters and give him an opportunity of overwhelming them with his superior forces After a few days they suddenly decamped and marched farther up the river but still posted themselves in such a manner as to preserve the advantage of the ground if the enemy should venture to attack them  Froissart liv chap  Edward insisted that all hazards should be run rather than allow these ravagers to escape with impunity but Mortimer's authority prevented the assault and opposed itself to the valour of the young monarch While the armies lay in this position an incident happened which had well nigh proved fatal to the English Douglas having got the word and surveyed exactly the situation of the English camp entered it secretly in the night time with a body of two hundred determined soldiers and advanced to the royal tent with a view of killing or carrying off the prince in the midst of his whole army But some of Edward's attendants awaking in that critical moment made resistance his chaplain and chamberlain sacrificed their lives for his safety the King himself after making a valiant defence escaped in the dark And Douglas having lost the greatest part of his followers was glad to make a hasty retreat with the remainder  Froissart liv chap Hemingford p Ypod Neust p Knyghton p  Soon after the Scottish army decamped without noise in the dead of  night and having thus got the start of the English arrived without farther loss in their own country Edward on entering the place of the Scottish encampment found only six Englishmen whom the enemy after breaking their legs had tied to trees in order to prevent their carrying any intelligence to their countrymen  Froissart liv chap    THE King was highly incensed at the disappointment which he had met with in his first enterprize and at the head of so gallant an army The symptoms which he had discovered of bravery and spirit gave extreme satisfaction and were regarded as sure prognostics of an illustrious reign But the general displeasure fell violently on Mortimer who was already the object of public odium And every measure which he pursued tended to aggravate beyond all bounds the hatred of the nation both against him and Queen Isabella  WHEN the council of regency was formed Mortimer tho' in the plenitude of his power had taken no care to ensure a place in it but this semblance of moderation was only a cover to the most exorbitant and most ambitious projects He rendered that council entirely useless by usurping to himself the whole sovereign power he settled on the Queendowager the greater part of the royal revenues he never consulted either the princes of the blood or the other noblemen in any public measure the King himself was so besieged by his creatures that no access could be procured to him and all the envy which had attended Gavaston and Spenser fell much more deservedly on this new favourite  MORTIMER sensible of the growing hatred of the people thought it requisite on any terms to secure peace abroad and he entered into a negociation with Robert Bruce for that purpose As the claim of superiority in England more than any other cause had tended to inflame the animosities between the two nations Mortimer consented to resign absolutely this pretension to give up all the homages done by the Scottish parliament and nobility and to acknowledge Robert as sovereign of Scotland  Rymer p Heming p Anon Hist p  In return for these mighty advantages Robert only stipulated the payment of marks to England This treaty was ratified by parliament  Ypod Neust p  but was nevertheless the source of great discontent among the people who having entered zealously into the pretensions of Edward I and deeming themselves disgraced by the successful resistance of so inferior a a nation were disappointed by this treaty in all future hopes both of conquest and of vengeance  THE princes of the blood Kent Norfolk and Lancaster were very much united in their councils and Mortimer entertained great suspicions of their designs  against him In summoning them to parliament he strictly prohibited them in the King's name from being attended with an armed force an illegal but usual practice in that age The three earls as they approached to Salisbury the place appointed for the meeting of parliament found that tho' they themselves in obedience to the King's command had brought only their usual retinue along with them Mortimer and his party were attended with all their followers in arms and they began with some reason to apprehend a dangerous design against their persons They therefore retreated assembled their retainers and were returning with an army to take vengeance on Mortimer when the weakness of Kent and Norfolk who deserted the common cause obliged Lancaster also to make his submissions  Knyghton p  The quarrel by the interposition of the prelates seemed for the present to be appeased  BUT Mortimer in order to intimidate the princes determined to have a victim and the simplicity with the good intentions of the earl of Kent afforded him soon after an opportunity of practising upon him By himself and his emissaries he endeavoured to persuade that prince that his brother King Edward was still alive and concealed in some secret prison in England The earl whose remorses for the part which he had acted against the late King probably inclined him to give credit to this intelligence entered into a design of restoring him to liberty of reinstating him on the throne and thereby of making some compensation for the injuries which he had unwarily done him  Avesbury p Anon Hist p    After this innocent contrivance had been allowed to proceed a certain length the earl was seized by Mortimer was accused before the parliament and condemned by these slavish tho' turbulent barons to lose his life and fortune  th March Execution of the earl of Kent  The queen and Mortimer apprehensive of young Edward's lenity towards his uncle hurried on the execution and the prisoner was beheaded next day But so general was the affection borne the earl and such pity prevailed for his hard fate that tho' peers had been easily found to condemn him it was evening before his enemies could find an executioner to perform the office  Heming p Ypod Neust p Knyghton p    THE earl of Lancaster on pretence of his assent to this conspiracy was soon after thrown into prison Many others of the prelates and nobility were prosecuted Mortimer employed this engine to crush all his enemies and enrich himself and his family by the forfeitures The estate of the earl of Kent was seized for his younger son Geoffrey The immense fortunes of the Spensers and their adherents were mostly converted to his own use He affected a state and dignity  equal or superior to the royal His power became formidable to every one His illegal practices were daily complained of And all parties forgetting former animosities conspired in their hatred against Mortimer  IT was impossible that these abuses could long escape the observation of a prince endowed with so much spirit and judgment as young Edward who being now in his eighteenth year and feeling himself capable of government repined at being held in fetters by this insolent minister But so much was he surrounded with the emissaries of Mortimer that it behoved him to conduct the project for subverting him with the same secrecy and precaution as if he had been forming a conspiracy against his sovereign He communicated his intentions to the lord Mountacute who engaged the lords Molins and Clifford sir John Nevil of Hornby sir Edward Bohun Ufford and others to enter into their views and the castle of Nottingham was chosen for the scene of the enterprize The Queendowager and Mortimer lodged in that fortress The King also was admitted tho' with a few only of his attendants And as the castle was strictly guarded the gates locked every evening and the keys carried to the Queen it became necessary to communicate the design to sir William Eland the governor who entered zealously into it By his direction the King's associates were admitted thro' a subterraneous passage which had been formerly contrived for a secret outlet to the castle but was now buried in rubbish and Mortimer without having it in his power to make resistance was suddenly seized in an apartment adjoining to the Queen's  Avesbury p  A parliament was immediately called for his trial He was accused before that assembly of having usurped regal power from the council of regency appointed by parliament of having procured the death of the late King of having deceived the earl of Kent into a conspiracy to restore that prince of having solicited and obtained exorbitant grants of the royal demesnes of having dissipated the public treasure of secreting for his own use marks of the money paid by the King of Scotland and of other crimes and misdemeanours  Brady's App N  o  Anon Hist p Knyghton p    Execution of Mortimer th Novem  The parliament condemned him from the supposed notoriety of the facts without trial or hearing his answer or examining a witness and he was hanged on a gibbet at the Elmes in the neighbourhood of London It is remarkable that this sentence was near twenty years after reversed by parliament in favour of Mortimer's son and the reason assigned was the illegal form of the proceedings  Cotton's Abridg p  The principles of law and justice were established in England not in such a degree as to prevent any iniquitous sentence against a person obnoxious to the ruling party but sufficient on  the return of his credit or that of his friends to serve as a reason or pretence for its reversal  JUSTICE was also executed by a sentence of the house of peers on some of the inferior criminals particularly on Simon de Bereford But the barons in that case entered a protest that tho' they had tried Bereford who was none of their peers they should not for the future be obliged to receive any such accusation The Queen was confined to her own house at Risings near London Her revenue was reduced to pounds a year  Cotten's Abridg p  And tho' the King during the remainder of her life paid her a decent visit once or twice a year she never was able to reinstate herself in any credit or authority  EDWARD having now taken the reins of government into his own hands applied himself with industry and judgment to redress all those grievances which had either proceeded from want of authority in the crown or from the late abuses of it He issued writs to the judges enjoining them to administer justice without paying any regard to arbitrary orders from the ministers And as the robbers thieves murderers and criminals of all kinds had during the course of public convulsions multiplied to an enormous degree and were openly protected by the great barons who made use of them against their enemies the King after exacting from the peers a solemn promise in parliament that they would break off all connexion with such malefactors  Cotten's Abridg  set himself in earnest to remedy the evil Many of these gangs had become so numerous as to require his own presence to dissipate them and he exerted both courage and industry in executing this salutary office The ministers of justice from his example employed the utmost diligence in discovering pursuing and punishing the criminals and this disorder was by degrees corrected or at lest palliated the utmost that could be expected with regard to a disease inherent in the constitution  State of Scotland  IN proportion as the government acquired authority at home it became formidable to the neighbouring nations and the ambitious spirit of Edward sought and soon found an opportunity of exerting itself The wise and valiant Robert Bruce who had recovered by arms the independancy of his country and had fixed it by the last treaty of peace with England soon after died and left David his son a minor under the guardianship of Randolf earl of Murray the companion of all his victories It had been stipulated in this treaty that both the Scottish nobility who before the commencement of the wars enjoyed lands in England and the English who inherited estates in Scotland should be restored to their several  possessions  Rymer vol p  But tho' this article had been executed pretty regularly on the part of Edward Robert who saw the estates claimed by Englishmen much more numerous and valuable than the other either esteemed it dangerous to admit so many secret enemies into the kingdom or found it difficult to wrest from his own followers the possessions bestowed on them as the reward of their fatigues and dangers And he had protracted the performance of his part of the stipulation The English nobles disappointed in their expectations began to think of a remedy and as their influence was great in the north their enmity alone even tho' unsupported by the King of England became dangerous to the minor prince who succeeded to the Scottish throne  EDWARD BALIOL the son of that John who was crowned King of Scotland had been detained some time a prisoner in England after his father was released but having also obtained his liberty he went over to France and lived in Normandy on his patrimonial estate in that country without any thoughts of reviving the claims of his family upon the crown of Scotland His pretensions however plausible had been so strenuously abjured by the Scots and rejected by the English that he was entirely regarded as a private person and he had been thrown into prison on account of some private offence against the laws of which he was accused The lord Beaumont a great English baron who in the right of his wife claimed the earldom of Buchan in Scotland  Rymer vol p  found him in this situation and deeming him a proper instrument for his purpose made such interest with the King of France who was not aware of the consequences that he recovered him his liberty and brought him over with him into England  THE injured nobles possessed of such a head began now to think of vindicating their rights by force of arms and they applied to Edward for his concurrence and assistance But there were several reasons which deterred the King from openly avowing their enterprize In his treaty with Scotland he had entered into a bond of pounds payable to the Pope if within four years he violated the peace and as the term was not yet elapsed he dreaded the exacting of that penalty by the sovereign pontiff who possessed so many means of forcing him to make payment He was also afraid that violence and injustice would every where be imputed to him if he attacked with such superior force a minor King and a brotherinlaw whose independant title had so lately been acknowledged by a solemn treaty And as the regent of Scotland on every demand which had been made of restitution to the English barons had always confessed  the justice of their claim and had only given an evasive answer grounded on plausible pretences Edward resolved not to proceed to open violence but to emply like artifices against him He secretly encouraged Baliol in his enterprize connived at his assembling forces in the north and gave countenance to the nobles who were disposed to join in the attempt A force of near men was inlisted under Baliol by Umsreville earl of Angus the lords Beaumont Ferrars Fitzwarin Wake Stafford Talbot and Moubray And as these adventurers apprehended that the frontiers would be strongly armed and guarded they resolved to make their attack by sea and having embarked at Ravenspur they reached in a few days the coast of Fife  SCOTLAND was at present in a very different situation from that in which it had appeared under the victorious Robert Besides the loss of that great monarch whose genius and authority preserved entire the whole political fabric and maintained an union among the unruly barons lord Douglas impatient of rest had gone over to Spain in a croisade against the Moors and had there perished in battle  Froissart liv chap  The earl of Murray who had been long declining in age and infirmities had lately died and had been succeeded in the regency by Donald earl of Matte a man of much inferior talents The military spirit of the Scots tho' still unbroken was left without a proper guidance and direction And a minor King seemed ill qualified to defend an inheritance which it had required all the consummate valour and abilities of his father to acquire and maintain But as the Scots were apprized of the intended invasion great numbers on the appearance of the English fleet immediately ran to the shore in order to prevent the landing of the enemy Baliol had valour and activity and he repulsed the Scots with a considerable loss  Heming p Walsing p Knyghton p  He marched westward into the heart of the country flattering himself that the antient partizans of his family would declare for him But the fierce animosity which had been kindled between the two nations inspiring the Scots with a strong prejudice against a prince who was supported by the English he was regarded as a common enemy and the regent found no dufficulty in assembling a great army to oppose him It is pretended that Marre had no less than men under his standard but the same hurry and impatience that made him collect a force which from its greatness was so disproportioned to the occasion rendered all his motions unskilful and imprudent The river Erne ran between the two armies and the Scots confiding in that security as well as in their great supriority of numbers kept no order in their encampment  th August  Baliol passed the river in the night time attacked the unguarded  and undisciplined Scots threw them into confusion which was encreased by the darkness and by their very numbers to which they trusted and he beat them off the field with great slaughter  Knyghton p  But in the morning the Scots were at some distance they were ashamed of having yielded the victory to so weak a foe and they hurried back to recover the honour of the day Their eager passions carried them precipitately to battle without regard to some broken ground which lay between them and the enemy and which disordered and confounded their ranks Baliol seized the favourable opportunity advanced his troops upon them prevented them from rallying and chaced them anew off the field with redoubled slaughter There fell above Scots in this action and among these the flower of their nobility the regent himself the earl of Carric a natural son of their late King the earls of Athole and Monteith the lord Hay of Errol constable and the lords Keith and Lindsey The loss of the English scarce exceeded thirty men a strong proof among many others of the miserable state of military discipline in those ages  Heming p Walsingham p Knyghton p    BALIOL soon after made himself master of Perth but still was not able to bring over any of the Scots to his party Patric Dunbar earl of Marche and Sir Archibald Douglas brother to the lord of that name appeared at the head of the Scottish armies which amounted still to near men and they proposed to reduce Baliol and the English by famine They invested Perth by land they collected some vessels with which they blockaded it by water But Baliol's ships attacking the Scottish fleet gained a compleat victory over them and opened the communication to Perth by sea  Heming p Knyghton p  It then behoved the Scottish armies to disperse themselves for want of pay and subsistance The nation was in effect subdued by a handful of men Each nobleman who found himself most exposed to danger successively submitted to Baliol  th Septr  That prince was crowned King at Scone David his competitor was sent over to France with his betrothed wife Jane sister to Edward And the heads of his party sued to Baliol for a truce which he granted them in order to assemble a parliament in tranquillity and have his title recognized by the whole Scottish nation  BUT Baliol's imprudence or his necessities making him dismiss the greatest part of his English followers he was notwithstanding the truce attacked of a sudden near Annan by Sir Archibald Douglas and other chieftains of that party he was routed his brother John Baliol was slain he himself was chaced into England in a miserable  condition and thus lost his kingdom by a revolution as quick as that by which he had acquired it  WHILE Baliol enjoyed his shortliv'd and precarious royalty he had been sensible that without the protection of England it would be impossible for him to maintain possession of the throne and he had secretly sent a message to Edward offering to acknowledge his superiority to renew the homage for his crown and to espouse the princess Jane if the Pope's consent could be obtained for dissolving her former marriage which was not yet consummated Edward ambitious of recovering that important sacrifice made by Mortimer during his minority threw off all scruples and willingly accepted the offer  War with Scotland  but as the dethronement of Baliol had rendered this concession of no effect the King prepared to reinstate him in possession of the crown an enterprize which appeared from late experience so easy and so little hazardous As he possessed many popular arts he consulted his parliament on this occasion but that assembly finding the resolution already taken declined giving any opinion and only supplied him in order to support the enterprize with an aid of a fifteenth from the personal estates of the nobility and gentry and a tenth of the moveables of boroughs And they added a petition that the King would thenceforth live of his own without grieving his subjects by illegal taxes or by the outrageous seizure of their goods in the shape of purveyance  Cotton's Abridgm    AS the Scots expected that the chief brunt of the war would fall upon Berwic Douglas the regent threw a strong garrison into that place under the command of Sir William Keith and he himself assembled a great army on the frontiers ready to penetrate into England so soon as Edward should have invested that fortress The English army was less numerous but better supplied with arms and provisions and retained in stricter discipline and the King notwithstanding the valiant defence of Keith had in two months time reduced the garrison to extremity and had obliged them to capitulate They engaged to surrender the place if they were not relieved within a few days by their countrymen  Rymer vol p  This intelligence being conveyed to the Scottish army which was preparing to invade Northumberland changed their whole plan of operations and engaged them to advance towards Berwic and attempt the relief of that important place Douglas who had ever proposed to decline a pitched battle in which he was sensible of the enemy's superiority and who intended to have drawn out the war by small skirmishes and by mutually ravaging each others country was forced by the impatience of his troops to put the whole fate of the kingdom upon the  event of one day He attacked the English at Halidownhill a little north of Berwic  th July  and tho' the Scottish  Gens d'armes  dismounted from their horses in order to render the action more steddy and desperate they were received with such valour by Edward and were so galled by the English archers that they were soon thrown into disorder and on the fall of Douglas their general were put to absolute rout The whole army sled in confusion and the English but much more the Irish gave little quarter in the pursuit All the nobles of chief distinction were either slain or taken prisoners Near thirty thousand of the Scots fell in the action While the loss of the English amounted only to one knight one esquire and thirteen private soldiers An inequality almost incredible  Heming p Knyghton p Otterborne p    AFTER this fatal blow the Scottish nobles had no other resource but instant submission and Edward leaving a considerable body with Baliol to compleat the conquest of the kingdom returned with the remainder of his army into England Baliol was acknowledged King by a parliament assembled at Edinburgh  Rymer vol p  the superiority of England was again recognized many of the Scottish nobility swore fealty to him and to compleat the misfortunes of that nation Baliol ceded to Edward Berwic Dunbar Roxborough Edinburgh and all the southeast counties of Scotland which were declared to be for ever annexed to the English monarchy  Rymer vol p    IF Baliol on his first appearance was dreaded by the Scots as an instrument employed by England for the subjection of the kingdom this deed confirmed all their suspicions and rendered him the object of universal hatred Whatever submissions they might be obliged to make they considered him not as their prince but as the delegate and confederate of their determined enemy and neither the manners of the age nor the state of Edward's revenue permitting him to maintain a constant standing army in Scotland the English forces were no sooner withdrawn than the Scots revolted against Baliol and returned to their former allegiance under Bruce Sir Andrew Murray appointed regent by the party of this latter prince employed with success his valour and activity in many small but decisive actions against Baliol and in a short time had almost wholly expelled him the kingdom  Edward was obliged again to assemble an army and to march into Scotland The Scots taught by experience withdrew into their hills and fastnesses He destroyed the houses and ravaged the estates of those whom he called rebels But this confirmed them still farther in their obstinate antipathy  to England and to Baliol  and being now rendered desperate they were ready to take advantage on the first opportunity of the retreat of their enemy and they soon reconquered their country from the English Edward made anew his appearance in Scotland with like success He found every thing hostile in the kingdom except the spot on which he was encamped And tho' he marched uncontrouled over all the low countries the nation itself was farther than ever from being broken and subdued Besides being supported by their pride and anger passions difficult to tame they were encouraged amidst all their calamities by darly promises of relief from France and as a war was now likely to break out between that kingdom and England they had reason to expect from this incident a great diversion of that force which had so long oppressed and overwhelmed them  WE now come to a transaction on which depended the most memorable events    not only of this long and active reign but of the whole English and French history during more than a century and it will therefore be necessary to give a particular account of the springs and causes of it It had long been a prevailing opinion that the crown of France could never descend to females and as nations in accounting for principles whish they regard as fundamental and as peculiar to themselves are fond of grounding them rather on primary laws than on blind custom it had been usual to derive this maxim from a clause in the Salian Code the law of an antient tribe among the Franks tho' that clause when strictly examined carries only the appearance of favouring this principle and does not rea ly by the confession of the best critics bear the sense commonly imposed upon it But tho' positive law seems wanting among the French for the exclusion of females the practice had prevailed and the rule was established beyond controversy on some antient as well as some modern precedents During the first race of the monarchy the Franks were so rude and barbarous a people that they were incapable of submitting to a female reign and in that period of  story there were frequent instances of kings advanced to royalty in prejudice of females who were related to the crown by nearer degrees of consanguinity These precedents joined to like causes had also established the male succession is the second race and tho' the instances were neither s  frequent nor so certain during that period the principle of excluding the female line seems still to have prevai ed and to have directed the conduct of the nation During the third race the crown had descended from father to son for eleven generations from Hugh Capet to Lewis Hutin and thus in fact during the course of nine hundred years the French monarchy had always been governed by males and  no female and none descended of females had ever mounted the throne Philip the Fair father of Lewis Hutin left three sons this Lewis Philip the Long and Charles the Fair and one daughter Isabella queen of England Lewis Hutin the eldest left at his death one daughter by Margaret sister to Eudes duke of Burgundy and as his queen was then pregnant Philip his younger brother was appointed regent till it should appear whether she was delivered of a son or daughter Her issue proved male but lived only a few days Philip was proclaimed King And as the duke of Burgundy made some opposition and asserted the right of his niece the states of the kingdom by a solemn and deliberate decree gave her the exclusion and declared all females for ever incapable of succeeding to the crown of France Philip died after a short reign leaving three daughters and his brother Charles without dispute or controversy then succeeded to the crown The reign of Charles was also short He lest one daughter but as his queen was pregnant the next male heir was appointed regent with a declared right of succession if the issue should prove female This prince was Philip de Valois cousin german to the deceased King being the son of Charles de Valois brother of Philip the Fair The queen of France was delivered of a daughter The regency ended and Philip de Valois was unanimously placed on the throne of France  THE King of England who was at that time a youth of fifteen years of age embraced a notion that he was intitled in right of his mother to the succession of the kingdom and that the claim of the nephew was preferable to that of the cousin german There could not well be conceived a notion weaker or worse grounded The principle of excluding females was of old an established opinion in France and had acquired equal authority with the most express and positive law It was supported by antient precedents It was confirmed by recent instances solemnly and deliberately decided And what placed it still farther beyond controversy if Edward was disposed to question its validity he thereby cut off his own pretensions since the three last Kings had all left daughters who were still alive and who stood before him in the order of succession He was therefore reduced to assert that tho' his mother Isabella was on account of her sex incapable of succession he himself who inherited thro' her was liable to no such objection and might claim by the right of propinquity But besides that this pretension was more favourable to Charles King of Navarre descended from the daughter of Lewis Hutin it was so contrary to the established principles of succession in every country of Europe  Froissart lib chap  was so repugnant to the practice both in private and public inheritances that no body in France thought of Edward's right Philip's  title was universally recognized and acknowledged  Froissart lib chap  And he never imagined that he had a competitor much less so formidable a one as the King of England  BUT tho' the youthful and ambitious mind of Edward had rashly entertained this notion he dit not think proper to insist on his pretensions which must have immediately involved him on very unequal terms in a dangerous and implacable war with so powerful a monarch Philip was a prince of mature years of great experience and at that time of an established character both for prudence and valour and by these circumstances as well as by the union of his people and their acquiescence in his undoubted right he possessed every advantage over a raw youth newly raised by injustice and violence to the government of the most intractable and most turbulent subjects in Europe But there immediately occurred an incident which required that Edward should either openly declare his pretensions or for ever renounce and abjure them He was summoned to do homage for Guienne Philip was preparing to compel him by force of arms That country was in a very bad state of defence And the forfeiture of so rich an inheritance was by the feudal law the immediate consequence of his resusing or declining to perform the duty of a vassal Edward therefore thought it prudent to submit to present necessity He went over to Amiens Did homage to Philip And as there had arisen some controversy concerning the terms of this subm ssion he afterwards sent over a formal deed in which he acknowledged that he owed liege homage to the crown of France  Rymer vol p Froissart liv chap Anon Hist p  Walsingham p Murimuth p  which was in effect ratifying and that in the strongest terms Philip's title to the crown of that kingdom His own claim indeed was so unreasonable and so thoroughly disavowed by the whole French nation that to insist on it was no better than to pretend to the entire conquest of the kingdom and it is probable that he would never have farther thought of it had it not been for some incidents which excited an animosity between the two monarchs  ROBERT D'ARTOIS was descended of the royal blood of France was a man of great character and authority had espoused Philip's sister and by his birth talents and credit was entitled to make the highest figure and to fill the most important offices in the monarchy This prince had lost the county of Artois which he claimed as his birthright by a sentence commonly deemed iniquitous of Philip the Fair and he was seduced to attempt the recovering possession by an action so unworthy of his rank and character as a forgery  Froissart liv chap  The detection of this crime covered him with shame and confusion His brother in law not  only abandoned him but prosecuted him with violence Robert incapable of bearing disgrace left the kingdom and hid himself in the Low Countries Being chaced from that retreat by the authority and menaces of Philip he came over to England was favourably received by Edward  Rymer vol p Froissart liv chap  and was soon admitted into the councils and shared the confidence of that monarch Abandoning himself to all the movements of rage and despair he endeavoured to revive the prepossessions entertained by Edward in favour of his title to the crown of France and even flattered him that it was not impossible for a prince of his valour and abilities to render his claim effectual The King was the more disposed to hearken to suggestions of this nature because he had in several particulars complaints against Philip's conduct with regard to Guienne and because that prince had both given protection to the exiled David Bruce and supported or at least encouraged the Scots in their struggles for independancy Thus resentment gradually filled the breasts of the two monarchs and made them incapable of hearkening to any terms of accommodation proposed by the Pope who never ceased interposing his good offices between them Philip thought that he would be wanting to the first principles of policy if he abandoned Scotland Edward pretended that he must relinquish all pretensions to generosity if he withdrew his protection from Robert d'Artois The former informed of some preparations for hostilities which had been made by his rival issued a sentence of felony and forfeiture against Robert d'Artois and declared that every vassal of the crown whether  within  or  without  the kingdom who gave countenance to that traitor was involved in the same sentence a menace easy to be understood The latter resolute not to yield endeavoured to form alliances in the Low Countries and on the frontiers of Germany the only places from which he either could make an effectual attack upon France or produce such a diversion as might save the province of Guienne which lay so much exposed to the power of Philip  Preparations for war with France  THE King began with opening his intentions to the count of Hainault his father in law and having engaged him in his interests he employed the good offices and councils of that prince in drawing into his alliance the other sovereigns of that neighbourhood The duke of Brabant was induced by his mediation and by large remittances of money from England to promise his concurrence  Rymer vol p  The archbishop of Cologn the duke of Guelders the marquis of Juliers the count of Namur the lords of Fauquemont and Baquen were engaged by like motives to embrace the English alliance  Froissart liv chap  These sovereigns could supply either from their own states or from the bordering countries great numbers of warlike  troops and nought was wanting to make the force on that quarter very formidable but the accession of Flanders which Edward procured by means somewhat extraordinary and unusual  AS the Flemings were the first people in the northern parts of Europe who cultivated arts and manufactures the lower ranks of men in that province had risen to a degree of riches unknown elsewhere to those of their station in that barbarous age had acquired privileges and independance and began to emerge from that state of vassalage or rather of slavery into which the common people had been universally thrown by the feudal institutions It was probably difficult for them to bring their sovereign and their nobility to conform themselves to the principles of law and civil government so much neglected in every other country It was impossible for them to confine themselves within the proper bounds in their opposition and resentment They had risen in tumults Had insulted the nobles Had chaced their earl into France And delivering themselves over to the guidance of a seditious leader had practiced all those insolences and disorders which the thoughtless and enraged populace are so much inclined to commit wherever they are so unfortunate as to be their own masters  Froissart liv chap Meyerus    THEIR present leader was James d'Arteville a brewer in Ghent who governed them with a more absolute sway than ever had been assumed by any of their lawful sovereigns He placed and displaced the magistrates at his pleasure He was accompanied with a guard who on the least signal from him instantly assassinated any man who happened to fall under his displeasure All the cities of Flanders were full of his spies and it was immediate death to give him the smallest umbrage The few nobles who remained in the country lived in continual terror of his violence He seized the estates of all those whom he had either banished or murdered and bestowing a part on their wives and children converted the remainder to his own use  Froissart liv chap  Such were the first effects which Europe saw of popular violence after having groaned during so many centuries under monarchical and aristocratical tyranny  JAMES D'ARTEVILLE was the man to whom Edward applied himself for bringing over the Flemings to his interest and that prince the most haughty and most aspiring of his age never courted any ally with so much assiduity and so many submissions as he employed towards this seditious and criminal mechanic D'Arteville proud of these advances from the King of England and sensible that the Flemings were naturally inclined to maintain connexions with the English who furnished them the materials of their woollen manufactures the chief  source of their opulence readily embraced the interests of Edward and invited him over into the Low Countries Edward before he entered on this great enterprize affected to consult his parliament asked their advice and obtained their consent  Cotton's Abridg  And the more to strengthen his hands he obtained from them a grant of sacks of wool which might amount to above a hundred thousand pounds This wool was a good instrument to employ with the Flemings and the price of it with his German allies He compleated the other necessary sums by loans by pawning the crown jewels by confiscating or rather robbing at once all the Lombards who now exercised the invidious trade formerly monopolized by the Jews of lending on interest  Dugd Baron vol p  and being attended with a body of English forces and with several of his nobility he sailed over into Flanders  THE German princes in order to justify their unprovoked hostilities against France had required the sanction of some legal authority and Edward that he might give them satisfaction on this head had applied to Lewis of Bavaria then emperor and had been created by him  vicar of the empire  an empty title but which seemed to give him a right of commanding the service of the princes of Germany  Froissart liv chap  The Flemings who were vassals of France pretending like scruples with regard to the invasion of their liege lord Edward by the advice of d'Arteville assumed in his commissions the title of King of France and by virtue of this right challenged their assistance for dethroning Philip de Valois the usurper of his kingdom  Heming p Walsingham p  This step which he feared would destroy all future amity between the kingdoms and beget endless and implacable jealousies in France was not taken by him without much reluctance and hesitation And as it was not in itself very justifiable it was in the issue attended with many miseries to both nations From this period we may date the commencement of that great animosity which the English have ever since borne to the French which has so visible an influence on all future transactions and which has been and continues to be the spring of many rash and precipitate resolutions among them In all the preceding reigns since the conquest the hostilities between the two crowns had been only casual and temporary and never being attended with any bloody or dangerous events the traces of them were easily obliterated by the first treaty of pacification The English nobility and gentry valued themselves on their French or Norman extraction They affected to employ the language of that country in all public transactions and even in familiar conversation And as both the English court and camp were always full of nobility who came from some province or other of France the two people were during  several centuries more intermingled together than any two distinct nations whom we meet with in history But the fatal pretensions of Edward III dissolved all these connexions and left the seeds of great animosity in both countries especially among the English For it is remarkable that this latter nation tho' they were commonly the aggressors and by their success and situation were enabled to commit the most cruel injuries on the other have always retained a stronger tincture of national antipathy nor is their hatred retaliated on them to an equal degree by the French That country lies in the middle of Europe has been successively engaged in hostilities with all its neighbours the popular prejudices have been diverted into many channels and among a people of softer manners they never rose to a great height against any particular nation  PHILIP made great preparations against the attack of the English and such as seemed more than sufficient to secure him from the danger Besides the concurrence of all the nobility in his own populous and warlike kingdom his foreign alliances were both more cordial and powerful than those which were formed by his antagonist The Pope who at this time lived in Avignon was dependant on France and being disgusted at the connexions between Edward and Lewis of Bavaria whom he had excommunicated he embraced with zeal and sincerity the cause of the French monarch The King of Navarre the duke of Britanny the count de Bar were in the same interests and on the side of Germany the King of Bohemia the palatine the dukes of Lorraine and Austria the bishop of Liege the counts de Deuxpont Vaudemont and Geneva The allies of Edward were in themselves weaker and having no other object but his money which began to be exhausted they were very slow in their motions and very irresolute in their measures  The duke of Brabant the most powerful among them seemed even inclined to withdraw himself wholly from the alliance and the King was necessitated both to give the Brabanters new privileges in trade and to contract his son Edward with the daughter of that prince ere he could bring him to fulfill his engagements The summer was wasted in conferences and negotiations before Edward could lead his armies into the field and he was obliged in order to assure his German allies into his measures to pretend that the first attack should be made upon Cambray a city of the empire which had been garrisoned by Philip  Froissart liv chap Heming p  But finding by a nearer inspection the difficulty of the enterprize upon this place he conducted them towards the frontiers of France and he there found by a sensible proof the vanity of his expectations The count de Namur and even the count de Hainault his brotherinlaw for the old count was dead refused  to commence hostilities against their liege lord and retired with all their troops  Froissart liv chap  So little account did they make of Edward's pretensions to the crown of France  War with France  THE King however entered the enemy's country and encamped on the fields of Vironfosse near Capelle with an army of near men composed almost entirely of foreigners Philip came within sight of him with an army of near double his force composed chiefly of native subjects and it was daily expected that a battle would have ensued But the English monarch was averse to engage against so great an inequality The French thought it sufficient if he eluded the attacks of his enemy without running any unnecessary hazard The two armies faced one another for some days Mutual defiances were sent And Edward at last retired backwards into Flanders and dispersed his army  Froissart liv chap Heming p Walsing p    SUCH was the fruitless and almost ridiculous conclusion of all Edward's mighty preparations and as his measures were the most prudent that could be embraced in his situation he might learn from experience in what a hopeless enterprize he was engaged His expences tho' they had led to no end had been consuming and destructive He had contracted near pounds of debt  Cotton's Abridg p  he had anticipated all his revenue he had pawned every thing of value which belonged either to himself or his queen he was obliged in some measure even to pawn himself to his creditors by desiring their permission to go over to England in order to procure supply and by promising on his word of honour to return in person if he did not remit them their money  BUT he was a prince of too much spirit to be discouraged by the first difficulties of an undertaking and he was anxious to retrieve his honour by more successful and more gallant enterprizes For this purpose he had during the course of the campaign sent orders to summon a parliament by his son Edward whom he had left with the title of guardian and to demand of them some supply in his urgent necessities The barons seemed inclined to grant his request but the knights who often at this time acted as a separate body from the burgesses made some scruple of taxing their constituents without asking their consent and they desired the guardian to summon a new parliament who might be properly empowered for that purpose The situation of the King and parliament was for the time nearly similar to that which they constantly fell into about the beginning of the last century and similar consequences began visibly to appear The King sensible of the frequent demands which he would be obliged to make on his people had been anxious to ensure to his friends a seat in the house of commons  and at his instigation the sheriffs and other placemen had made interest to be elected into that assembly an abuse which the knights desired the King to correct by the tenor of his writ of summons and which was accordingly remedied On the other hand the knights professedly annexed conditions to their intended grant and required a considerable retrenchment of the royal prerogatives particularly with regard to purveyance and the levying the antient feudal aids for knighting the King's eldest son and marrying his eldest daughter The new parliament called by the Guardian retained the same free spirit and tho' they offered a large supply of sacks of wool no business was concluded because the conditions which they annexed appeared too high to be compensated by a temporary concession But when Edward himself came over to England he summoned another parliament and he had the interest to procure a supply on more moderate terms A confirmation of the two charters and of the privileges of boroughs a pardon for old debts and trespasses and a remedy for some abuses in the execution of common law were the chief conditions insisted on and the King in return for his concessions on these heads obtained from the barons and knights an unusual grant for two years of the ninth sheaf lamb and fieece on their estates and from the burgesses a ninth of their moveables at their true value The whole parliament also granted a duty of forty shillings on each sack of wool exported on each three hundred woolfells and on each last of leather for the same term of years but dreading the arbitrary spirit of the crown they expressly declared that this grant was to continue no longer and was not to be drawn into precedent Being soon after sensible that this supply tho' considerable and very unusual in that age would come in slowly and would not answer the King's urgent necessities both from his past debts and his preparations for war they agreed that sacks of wool should immediately be granted him and their value be deducted from the ninths which were afterwards to be levied  BUT there appeared at this time another jealousy in the parliament which was very reasonable and was founded on a sentiment that ought to have engaged them rather to check than support the King in all those ambitious projects so little likely to prove successful and so dangerous to the nation if they did Edward who before the commencement of the former campaign had in several commissions assumed the title of King of France now more openly in all public deeds gave himself that appellation and always quartered the arms of France with those of England in all his seals and ensigns The parliament thought proper to obviate the consequences of this measure and to declare that they owed him no obedience as King of France and that the two kingdoms must forever  remain distinct and independant  Edward III  They undoubtedly foresaw that France if subdued would in the end prove the seat of government and they deemed this previous protestation necessary in order to prevent their becoming a province under that monarchy A very frail security if the event had really taken place  As Philip was apprized from the preparations which were making both in England and the low countries that he must expect another invasion from Edward he fitted out a great fleet of vessels manned with men  Naval victory th June  and he stationed them off Sluise with a view of intercepting the King in his passage The English navy was much inferior in number consisting only of ships but whether it was by the superior abilities of Edward or the greater dexterity of his seamen they gained the wind of the enemy and had the sun in their backs and with these advantages began the action The battle was fierce and bloody The English archers whose force and address were now much celebrated galled the French on their approach And when the ships grappled together and the contest became more steady and furious the example of the King and of so many gallant nobles who accompanied him animated to such a degree the seamen and soldiery that they maintained every where a superiority over the enemy The French also had been guilty of some imprudence in stationing themselves so near the coast of Flanders and choosing that place for the scene of action The Flemings descrying the battle hurried out of their ports and brought a reinforcement to the English which coming unexpectedly had a greater effect than in proportion to its power and numbers Two hundred and thirty French ships were taken Thirty thousand Frenchmen were killed with two of their admirals The loss of the English was inconsiderable compared to the greatness and importance of the victory  Froissart liv chap Avesbury p Heming p  None of Philip's courtiers it is said dared to inform him of the event till his fool or jester gave him a hint by which he discovered the loss that he had sustained  Walsing p    THE lustre of this great success added to the King's authority among his allies who assembled their forces with expedition and joined the English army Edward marched to the frontiers of France at the head of men consisting chiefly of foreigners a more numerous army than either before or since has ever been commanded by any King of England  Rymer vol p  At the same time the Flemings to the amount of men marched out under the command of Robert d'Artois and laid siege to St Omer but this tumultuous force composed entirely  of tradesmen unexperienced in war was routed by a sally of the garrison and notwithstanding the abilities of their leader was thrown into such a panic that they were instantly dispersed and never after appeared in the field The e terprizes of Edward tho' not attended with so inglorious an issue proved equally vain and fruitless The King of France had assembled an army more numerous than the English was accompanied with all the chief nobility of his kingdom was attended by many foreign princes and even by three monarchs the Kings of Bohemia Scotland and Navarre  Froissart liv chap  Yet he still adhered to the prudent resolution of putting nothing to hazard and after throwing strong garrisons into all the frontier towns he retired backwards persuaded that the enemy having wasted their force in some tedious and unsuccessful enterprize would afford him an easy victory  TOURNAY was at that time one of the most considerable cities of Flanders containing above inhabitants of all ages who were affectionate to the French government and as the secret of Edward's designs had not been strictly kept Philip learned that the English in order to gratify their Flemish allies had intended to open the campaign with the siege of this place He took care therefore to supply it with a garrison of men commanded by the bravest nobility of France and he reasonably expected that these forces joined to the inhabitants would be able to defend the city against all the efforts of the enemy Accordingly Edward when he commenced the siege about the end of July found every where an obstinate resistance The valour of the one side was encountered with equal valour by the other Every assault was repulsed and proved unsuccessful And the King was at last obliged to turn the siege into a blockade in hopes that the great numbers of the garrison and inhabitants which had enabled them to defend themselves against his attacks would but expose them to be the more easily reduced by famine  Froissart liv chap  The count d'Eu the governor as soon as he perceived that the English had formed this plan of operations endeavoured to spare his provisions by expelling all the useless mouths and the duke of Brabant who wished no success to Edward's enterprize gave every one a free passage thro' his quarters  AFTER the siege had continued ten weeks the city was reduced to distress and Philip recalling al his scattered garrisons advanced at the head of a mighty army within three leagues of the English camp with in intention of still avoiding any decisive action but of seeking some opportunity to throw relief into the place Here Edward irritated with the small progress which he had hitherto made  and with the disagreeable prospect that lay before him sent Philip a defiance by a herald and challenged him to decide their claims for the crown of France either by single combat or by an action of a hundred against a hundred or by a general engagement But Philip replied that Edward having done homage to him for his dutchy of Guienne and having solemnly acknowledged his superiority it by no means became him to send a defiance to his liege lord and sovereign That he was confident notwithstanding all his preparations and his conjunction with the rebellious Flemings to be able soon to chace him from the frontiers of France That as Edward's hostilities had prevented him from executing his purposed croisade against the infidels he trusted in the assistance of the Almighty who would reward his pious intentions and punish the aggressor whose ill grounded claims had rendered them ineffectual That Edward proposed a duel on very unequal terms and offered to hazard only his own person against both the kingdom of France and the person of the King But that if he would encrease the stake and put also the kingdom of England on the issue of the duel he would notwithstanding that the terms would still be unequal very willingly accept of his challenge  Du Tillet Recueil de Traitez c Heming p Walsing p  It was easy to see that those mutual bravadoes were intended only to dazle the populace and that the two kings were too wise to think of executing their pretended purpose  WHILE the French and English armies lay in this situation and a general action was every day expected Jane countess dowager of Hainault interposed with her good offices and endeavoured to conciliate peace between the contending monarchs and to prevent any farther effusion of blood This princess was mother inlaw to Edward and sister to Philip and tho' she had taken the vows in a convent and had abandoned the world she left her retreat on this occasion and employed all her pious efforts to allay those animosities which had taken place between persons so nearly related to her and to each other As Philip had no material claims upon his antagonist she found him to hearken very willingly to the proposals and even the haughty and ambitious mind of Edward convinced of his fruitless attempt was not averse to her negociation He was sensible from experience that he had engaged in an enterprize which far exceeded his force and that the power of England was never likely to prevail over that of a superior kingdom firmly united under an able and prudent monarch He discovered that all the allies whom he could gain by negotiation were at bottom averse to his enterprize and tho' they might second it to a certain length would immediately detach themselves and oppose its final accomplishment if ever they could be brought to  think that there was seriously any danger of it He even saw that their chief purpose was to obtain money from him and as his supplies from England came in very slowly and had much disappointed his expectations he was convinced of their growing indifference in his cause and of their zeal to embrace all plausible terms of accommodation  Convinced at last that an undertaking must be imprudent which could only be supported by means so unequal to the end he concluded a truce which left both parties in possession of their present acquisitions and stopped all farther hostilities on the side of the low countries Guienne and Scotland till Midsummer next  Froissart iv chap Avesbury p  A negotiation was soon after opened at Arras under the mediation of the Pope's legates and the truce was attempted to be converted into a solid peace Edward here required that Philip should free Guienne from all claims of superiority and entirely abandon the protection of Scotland But as he seemed not any wise entitled to make such exorbitant demands from either his past successes or future prospects they were totally rejected by Philip who agreed only to a prolongation of the truce  THE King of France soon after detached the emperor Lewis from the alliance of England and engaged him to revoke the title of imperial vicar which he had conferred on Edward  Heming p Ypod Neust p Knygton p  The King's other allies on the frontiers of France disappointed in their hopes gradually withdrew from the confederacy And Edward himself harrassed by his numerous and impatient creditors was obliged to make his escape by stealth into England  THE unusual imposition of a ninth sheaf lamb and fleece laid on by the parliament together with the great want of money and still more of credit in England had rendered the remittances to Flanders so backward nor could it be expected that any expeditious methods of collecting a tax which was so new in itself and which yielded only a gradual produce could possibly be contrived by the King or his ministers And tho' the parliament foreseeing the inconvenience had granted as a present resource sacks of wool the only English goods which bore a certain price in foreign markets and were the next to ready money it was impossible but the seizing of such a bulky commodity the gathering of it from different parts of the kingdom and the disposing of it abroad must take up much more time than the urgency of the King's aff irs would permit and occasion all the disappointments complained of during the course of the campaign But tho' nothing had happened which Edward might not reasonably have foreseen he was so irritated with the unfortunate issue of his military operations and so much  vexed and affronted by his foreign creditors that he was determined to throw the blame somewhere off himself and he came in very bad humour into England He discovered his present disposition by the first act which he performed after his arrival As he landed unexpectedly he found the Tower somewhat unguarded and he immediately committed to prison the constable and all others who had the charge of that fortress and he treated them with unusual rigour  Ypod Neust p  His vengeance fell next on the officers of the revenue the sheriffs the collectors of taxes the undertakers of all kinds and besides turning all of them out of their offices he appointed commissioners to enquire into their conduct and these men in order to gratify the King's humour were sure not to find any person innocent who came before them  Avesbury p Heming p Walsingham p  Sir John St Paul keeper of the privy seal Sir John Stonore lord chief justice Andrew Aubrey mayor of London were displaced and imprisoned as were also the bishop of Chichester chancellor and the bishop of Lichfield treasurer Stratford archbishop of Canterbury on whom the charge of collecting the new taxes had been chiefly laid fell likewise under the King's displeasure but being absent at the time of Edward's first arrival he escaped feeling the immediate effects of it  THERE were strong reasons which might discourage the Kings of England in those ages from bestowing the chief offices of the crown on prelates and other ecclesiastical persons These men had so entrenched themselves in privileges and immunities and pretended so openly to be exempt from all secular jurisdiction that no civil penalty could be inflicted on them for any malversation in office and as even treason itself was declared to be no canonical offence nor was allowed to be a sufficient reason for deprivation or other spiritual censures that order of men had ensured to themselves almost a total impunity and were not bound by any political laws or statutes But on the other hand there were many peculiar causes which favoured their promotion Desides that they possessed almost all the learning of the age and were best qualified for civil employments the prelates enjoyed equal dignity with the greatest barons and gave weight by their personal authority to the powers entrusted with them While at the same time they endangered not the crown by accumulating wealth or influence in their families and were restrained by the decency of their character from that open rapine and violence so often practised by the nobles These motives had induced Edward as well as many of his predecessors to entrust the chief parts of his government in the hands of ecclesiastics at the hazard of seeing them disown his authority so soon as it was turned against them  THIS was the case with archbishop Stratford That prelate informed of Edward's indignation against him prepared himself for the storm and not content with standing upon the defensive he resolved by beginning the attack to show the King that he knew the privileges of his character and had courage to maintain them He issued a general sentence of excommunication against all who on any pretext exercised violence on the person or goods of clergymen who infringed those privileges secured by the great charter and by the ecclesiastical canons or who accused a prelate of treason or any other crime in order to bring him under the King's displeasure  Heming p Ang Sacra vol p Walsingham p  Even Edward had reason to think himself struck at by this sentence both on account of the imprisonment of the two bishops and that of other clergymen concerned in levying the taxes and on account of his seizing their lands and moveables that he might make them answerable for any ballance which remained in their hands The clergy with the primate at their head were now formed into a regular combination against the King and many calumnies were spread against him in order to deprive him of the confidence and affections of his pe ple that he intended to recal the general pardon and the remission of old debts which he had granted and to impose new and arbitrary taxes without consent of parliament The archbishop went so far in a letter to the King himself as to tell him that there were two powers by which the world was governed the holy pontifical apostolic dignity and the royal subordinate authority That of these two powers the clerical was evidently the supreme since the priests were to answer at the tribunal of the divine judgment for the conduct of kings themselves That the clergy were the spiritual fathers of all the faithful and amongst others of kings and princes and were intitled by a heavenly charter to direct their wills and actions and to censure their transgressions And that prelates had heretofore cited emperors before their tribunal had tried their life and behaviour and had anathematized them for their obstinate offences  Anglia Sacra vol p  These topics were not well calculated to appease Edward's indignation and when he called a parliament he sent not to the primate as to the other peers a summons to appear in it Stratford was not discouraged with this mark of neglect or anger He appeared before the gates arrayed in his pontifical robes holding the crosier in his hand and attended with a pompous train of priests and prelates and he required admittance to his seat as the first and highest peer of the realm For two days the King denied him entrance But either sensible that this affair might be attended with dangerous consequences or that in his impatience he had groundlessly accused the primate  of malversation in his office which seems really to have been the case he at last permitted him to take his seat and was reconciled to him  Anglia Sacra vol p    EDWARD now found himself in a very bad situation both with his own people and with foreign states and it required all his genius and capacity to extricate himself from such multiplied difficulties and embarrassments His unjust and exorbitant claims on France and Scotland had engaged him in an implacable war with these two kingdoms his nearest neighbours He had lost almost all his foreign alliances by his irregular payments He was deeply involved in debts for which he owed a consuming interest His military operations had vanished into smoke and except his naval victory none of them had been attended even with glory or renown either to himself or to the nation The animosity between him and the clergy was open and declared The people were discontented on account of many arbitrary measures in which he had been engaged And what was more dangerous the nobility taking advantage of his present necessities were determined to retrench his power and by encroaching on the antient prerogatives of the crown to require to themselves independance and authority But the aspiring g  of Edward which had so far transported him beyond the bounds of discretion proved at last sufficient to reinstate him in his former authority and finally to render his reign the most triumphant which is to be met with in English story Tho' for the present he was obliged with some loss of honour to yield to the current which bore so strongly against him  THE parliament framed an act which was likely to produce considerable innovations in the government They premised that whereas the great charter had to the manifest peril and slander of the King and damage of his people been violated in many points particularly by the imprisonment of free men and the seizure of their goods without suit indictment or trial it was necessary to confirm it anew and to oblige all the chief officers of the law together with the steward and chamberlain of the houshold the keeper of the privy seal the controller and treasurer of the wardrobe and those who were entrusted with the education of the young prince to swear to the regular observance of it They also remarked that the peers of the realm had formerly been arrested and imprisoned and dispossessed of their temporalities and lands and even some of them put to death without judgment of their peers and they therefore enacted that such violences should henceforth cease and no peer be punished but by the award of his peers  in parliament  They required that whenever any of the great offices abovementioned should become vacant the King should fill it by the advice of  his council  the consent of other great men who should at that time be found to reside in the neighbourhood of the court And they enacted that on the third day of every session the King should resume into his own hands all these offices except those of justices of the two benches and the barons of exchequer that these ministers should for the time be reduced to private persons that they should in that condition answer before the parliament to any accusations brought against them and that if they were found any wise guilty they should finally be dispossessed of their offices and more sufficient persons be substituted in their place  Edw III  By these last regulations the barons approached as near as they dared to those restrictions which had formerly been imposed on Henry III and Edward II and which from the dangerous consequences attending them had become so generally odious that they neither expected to have the concurrence of the people in demanding them nor the assent of the present King in granting them  IN return for these important concessions the parliament profered the King a grant of sacks of wool and his wants were so urgent from the clamours of his creditors and the demands of his foreign allies that he was obliged to accept of the supply on these hard conditions He ratified this statute in full parliament but he  secretly  entered a protest of such a nature as was sufficient one should imagine to destroy for the future all trust and confidence with his people He declared that so soon as his convenience permitted he would from his own authority revoke what had been extorted from him  Statutes at large Edw III That this protest of the King's was  sec  et  appears evidently since otherwise it would have been ridiculous in the parliament to have accepted  Besides the King owns that he  dissembled  which would not have been the case had    Accordingly he was no sooner possessed of the parliamentary supply than he issued an edict which contains many extraordinary positions and pretensions He first asserts that that statute had been enacted contrary to the law as if a free legislative body could ever do any thing illegal He next affirms that as it was hurtful to the prerogatives of the crown which he was sworn to defend he had only dissembled when he seemed to ratify it but that he had never in his own breast given his assent to it He does not pretend that either he or the parliament lay under any force but only that some inconvenience would have ensued had he not seemingly given his assent to that pretended statute He therefore with the advice of his council and of some earls and barons abrogates and annulls it and tho' he professes himself willing and determined to observe such articles of it as were formerly law he declares it to have thenceforth no force or authority  Statutes at large Edw III  The parliaments who were afterwards assembled took no notice of this arbitrary exertion  of royal power which by a parity of reason left all their laws at the mercy of the King and during the course of two years Edward had so far reestablished his influence and freed himself from his present necessities that he then obtained from his parliament a legal repeal of the obnoxious statute  Cotton's Abridgm p  This transaction certainly contains remarkable circumstances which discover the manners and sentiments of the age and may prove what inaccurate work might be expected from such rude hands when employed in legislation and in rearing the delicate fabric of laws and a constitution  BUT tho' Edward had happily recovered his authority at home which had been impaired by the events of the French war he had undergone so many mortifications from that attempt and saw so little prospect of success that he would probably have dropt his claim had not a revolution in Brittany opened to him more promising views and given his enterprizing genius a full opportunity of displaying itself  Affairs of Brittany  JOHN III duke of Brittany had some years before his death found himself declining thro' age and infirmities and having no issue he was solicitous to prevent those disorders to which on the event of his decease a disputed succession might expose his subjects His younger brother the count de Penthievre had left only one daughter whom the duke deemed his heir and as his family had inherited the dutchy by a female succession he thought her title preferable to that of the count de Mountfort who being his brother by a second marriage was the male heir of that principality  Froissart liv chap  He accordingly proposed to bestow her in marriage on some person who might be able to defend her rights and he cast his eye on Charles de Blois nephew of the King of France by his mother Margaret de Valois sister to that monarch But as he both loved his subjects and was beloved by them he determined not to take this important step without their approbation and having assembled the states of Brittany he represented to them the advantages of that alliance and the prospect which it gave of an entire settlement of his succession The Bretons willingly concurred in his choice The marriage was concluded All his vassals and among the rest the count de Mountfort swore fealty to Charles and to his spouse as to their future sovereigns And every danger of civil commotions seemed to be obviated as far as human prudence could provide a remedy against them  BUT on the death of this good prince the ambition of the count de Mountfort broke thro' all these regulations and kindled a war not only dangerous to Brittany but to a great part of Europe While Charles de Blois was solliciting at  the court of France the investiture of the dutchy Mountfort was active in acquiring immediate possession of it and by force or intrigue he made himself master of Rennes Nantz Brest Hennebonne and all the most important fortresses and engaged many considerable barons to acknowledge his authority  Froissart    Sensible that he could expect no favour from Philip he made a voyage to England on pretence of solliciting his claim to the earldom of Richmond which had devolved to him by his brother's death and offering to do homage to Edward as King of France for the dutchy of Brittany he proposed a strict alliance for the support of each other's pretensions Edward saw immediately the advantages attending this treaty Mountfort an active and valiant prince closely united to him by interest opened at once an entrance into the heart of France and afforded him much more flattering views than his allies on the side of Germany and the Low Countries who had no sincere attachment to his cause and whose progress was also obstructed by those numerous fortifications which had been raised on that frontier Robert d'Artois was zealous in inforcing these considerations  The ambitious spirit of Edward was little disposed to sit down under those repulses which he had received and which he thought had so much injured his reputation And it required a very short negotiation to conclude a treaty of alliance between two men who tho' their pleas with regard to the preference of male or female succession were directly opposite were intimately connected by their common interests  Froissart liv chap    AS this treaty was still a secret Mountfort on his return ventured to appear at Paris in order to defend his cause before the court of peers but observing Philip and his judges to be prepossessed against his title and dreading their intentions of arresting him till he should restore what he had seized by violence he suddenly made his escape and war immediately broke out between him and Charles de Blois  Froissart liv  Philip sent his eldest son the duke of Normandy with a powerful army to the assistance of the latter and Mountfort unable to keep the field against his rival remained in the city of Nantz where he was besieged The city was taken by the treachery of the inhabitants Mountfort fell into the hands of his enemies was conducted as a prisoner to Paris and was shut up in the tower of the Leuvre  Froissart liv chap    THIS event seemed to put an end to the pretensions of the count de Mountfort but his affairs were immediately retrieved by an unexpected incident which inspired new life and vigour into his party Jane of Flanders countess of Mountfort the  most extraordinary woman of that age was rouzed by the captivity of her husband from those domestic cares to which she had hitherto limited her genius and she courageously undertook to support the falling fortunes of her family No sooner did she receive the fatal intelligence than she assembled the inhabitants of Rennes where she then resided and carrying her infant son in her arms deplored to them the calamity of their sovereign and recommended to their care the illustrious orphan the sole male remaining of their antient princes who had governed them with such indulgence and lenity and to whom they had ever professed such a zealous attachment She declared herself willing to run all hazards with them in so just a cause discovered the resources which still remained in the alliance of England and entreated them to make one effort against an usurper who being imposed on them by the arms of France would in return make a sacrifice to his protector of the antient liberties of Brittany The audience moved by the affecting appearance and inspirited by the noble conduct of the princess vowed to live and die with her in defending the rights of her family All the other fortresses of Brittany embraced the same resolution The countess went from place to place encouraging the garrisons providing them with every necessary for subsistance concerting their plans of defence and after she had put the whole province in a proper posture she shut herself up in Hennebonne where she waited with impatience the arrival of those succours which Edward had promised her Mean while she sent over her son to England both that she might put him in a place of safety and engage the King more strongly by such a pledge to embrace with zeal the interests of her family  CHARLES DE BLOIS anxious to make himself master of so important a fortress as Hennebonne and still more to take the countess prisoner from wh se vigour and capacity all the difficulties to his succession in Brittany now proceeded sat down before the place with a great army composed of French Spaniards Genoese and some Bretons and he conducted the attack with indefatigable industry  Froissart liv chap  The defence was no less vigorous The besiegers were repulsed in every assault Frequent sallies were made with success by the garrison And the countess herself being the most forward in all military operations every one was ashamed not to do his duty to the utmost in this desperate situation One day she perceived that the besiegers entirely employed in an attack had neglected a distant quarter of their camp and she immediately sallied forth at the head of a body of cavalry threw them into confusion committed great slaughter upon them and set fire to their tents baggage and magazines But when she was about to return she found that she was intercepted and that a great body of the  enemy had thrown themselves between her and the gates She instantly took her resolution she ordered her men to disband and to make the best of their way by flight to Brest She met them at the appointed place of rendezvous collected another body of horse returned to Hennebonne broke unexpectedly thro' the enemies camp and was received with shouts and acclamations by the garrison who encouraged by this reinforcement and by so rare an example of female valour determined to defend themselves to the last extremity  THE reiterated attacks however of the besiegers had at length made several breache in the walls and it was apprehended that a general assault which was every hour expected would overpower the garrison diminished in their numbers and extremely weakened with watching and fatigue It became necessary to treat of a capitulation and the bishop of Leon was already engaged for that purpose in a conference with Charles de Blois when the countess who had mounted on a high tower and was looking towards the sea with great impatience descried some sails at a distance She immediately exclaimed  Behold the succours the English succours No capitulation  Fro  ssart  This fleet carried a body of English gensdarmes and six thousand archers whom Edward had prepared for the relief of Hennebonne but who had been long detained by contrary winds They entered the harbour under the command of Sir Walter Manny one of the bravest captains of England and having inspired fresh courage into the garrison immediately sallied forth beat the besiegers from all their posts and obliged them to decamp  BUT notwithstanding this success the countess of Mountfort found that her party overpowered by superior numbers were declining in every quarter and she went over to sollicit more effectual succours from the King of England Edward granted her a considerable reinforcement under Robert d'Artois who embarked his troops on board a fleet of forty five ships and sailed to Brittany He was met in his passage by the enemy an action ensued where the countess behaved with her wonted valour and charged the enemy sword in hand but the fleets after a sharp action were separated by a storm and the English arrived safely in Brittany The first exploit of Robert d'Artois was the taking of Vannes which he mastered by conduct and address  Froissart liv chap  But he survived a very little time this prosperity The Breton noblemen of the party of Charles assembled secret y in arms attacked Vannes of a sudden and carried the place chiefly by reason of an wound received by Robert d' Artois of which he soon after died at sea on his return to England  Froissart liv chap    AFTER the death of this unfortunate prince the chief author of all the calamities with which his country was overwhelmed for above a century Edward undertook in person the defence of the countess of Mountfort and as the last truce with France was now expired the war which the English and French had hitherto carried on as allies to the competitors for Brittany is thenceforth conducted in the name and under the standard of the two monarchs The King landed at Morbian near Vannes with an army of men and being master of the field where no enemy dared to appear against him he endeavoured to give a lustre to his arms by commencing at once three important sieges that of Vannes of Rennes and of Nantz But by undertaking too much he failed of success in all his enterprizes Even the siege of Vannes which Edward in person conducted with vigour advanced but slowly  Froissart liv chap  and the French had all the leisure requisite for making preparations against him The duke of Normandy eldest son of Philip appeared in Brittany at the head of an army of infantry and cavalry and Edward was now obliged to draw together all his forces and to entrench himself strongly before Vannes where the duke of Normandy soon after arrived and in a manner invested the besiegers The garrison and the French camp were plentifully supplied with provisions while the English who dared to make no attempt upon the place in the presence of a superior army drew all their subsistance from England exposed to the hazards of the sea and sometimes to those arising from the fleet of the enemy  In this dangerous situation Edward very willingly hearkened to the mediation of the Pope's legates the cardinals of Palestrine and Frescati who endeavoured to negotiate if not a peace at least a truce between the two kingdoms A treaty was concluded for a cessation of arms during three years  Froissart liv chap Avesbury p  and Edward had the ability notwithstanding his present dangerous situation to procure to himself very equal and honourable terms It was agreed that Vannes should be sequestered during the truce in the hands of the legates to be disposed of afterwards as they pleased and tho' Edward knew the partiality of the court of Rome towards his antagonist he saved himself by this devise from the dishonour of having undertaken a fruitless enterprize It was also stipulated that all prisoners should be released that the places in Brittany should remain in the hands of the present possessors and that the allies on both sides should be comprehended in the truce  Heming p  Edward soon after concluding this treaty embarked with his army for England  THE truce tho' calculated for a long time was of very short duration and each monarch endeavoured to throw on the other the blame of its infraction Of course the historians of the two countries differ in their account of the matter It seems probable however as is affirmed by the French writers that Edward in consenting to the truce had no other purpose than to extricate himself from a perilous situation into which he had fallen and was afterwards very careless of its observance In all the memorials which remain on this subject he complains chiefly of the punishment inflicted on Oliver de Clisson Henry de Leon and other Breton noblemen who he says were partizans of the family of Mountfort and consequently under the protection of England  Rymer vol p Heming p  But it appears from the history that at the conclusion of the truce those noblemen had openly by their declarations and actions embraced the cause of Charles de Blois  Froissart liv chap p  and if they had entered into any secret correspondence and engagements with Edward they were traitors to their party and were justly punishable by Philip and Charles for their breach of faith nor had Edward any just ground of complaint against France for such severities  But when he laid these pretended injuries before the parliament whom he affected to consult on all occasions that assembly entered into the quarrel advised the King not to be amused by a fraudulent truce and granted him supplies for the renewal of the war The counties were charged with a fifteenth for two years and the boroughs with a tenth The clergy consented to give a tenth for three years  THESE supplies enabled the King to complete his military preparations and he sent his cousin Henry earl of Derby son of the earl of Lancaster into Guienne for the defence of that province  Froissart liv chap Avesbury p  This prince the most accomplished of the English court possessed in a high degree the virtue of humanity as well as those of valour and conduct  It is reported of this prince that having once before the attack of a town promised the soldiers the plunder one private man happened to fall upon a great chest full of money which he immediately brought to the earl as thinking it too great for himself to keep possession of it But Derby told him that his promise did not depend on the greatness or smallness of the sum and bid him keep it all for his own use  and not content with protecting and cherishing the province committed to his charge he made a very successful invasion on the enemy He attacked the count de Laille the French general at Bergerac beat him from his entrenchments and took the place He reduced a great part of Perigord and continually advanced in his conquests till the count de Laille having collected an army of ten or twelve thousand men sat down before Auberoche in hopes  of recovering that place which had fallen into the hands of the English  The earl of Derby came upon him by surprize with only a thousand cavalry threw the French into disorder pushed his advantages and obtained a complete victory De Laille himself with many considerable nobles was taken prisoner  Froissart liv chap  After this important advantage Derby made a rapid progress in subduing the French provinces He took Monsegur Monpesat Villefranche Miremont and Tonnins with the fortress of Damassen Aiguillon a fortress deemed impregnable fell into his hands from the cowardice of the governor Angouleme was surrendered after a short siege The only place where he met with a considerable resistance was Reole which however was at last reduced after a siege of above nine weeks  Froissart liv chap  Having made an attempt on Blaye he thought it more prudent to raise the siege rather than waste his time before a place of small importance  Froissart liv chap    THE reason why Derby was permitted without opposition to make such progress on the side of Guienne was the difficulties under which the French finances then laboured and which had obliged Philip to lay on new impositions particularly the duty on salt to the great discontent and almost mutiny of his subjects But after the court of France was supplied with money great preparations were made and the duke of Normandy attended by the duke of Burgundy and other great nobility led towards Guienne a powerful army which the English could not think of resisting in the open field The earl of Derby stood on the defensive and allowed the French to carry on at leisure the siege of Angouleme which was their first enterprize John lord Norwich the governor after a brave and vigorous defence found himself reduced to extremities and he was obliged to employ a stratagem in order to save his garrison and to prevent his being reduced to surrender at discretion He appeared on the walls and desired to speak with the duke of Normandy The prince when he came told Norwich that he supposed he intended to capitulate  "Not at all"  replied the governor  "But as tomorrow is the feast of the Virgin to whom I know that you sir as well as myself bear a great devotion I desire a cessation of arms for that day"  The proposals were agreed to and Norwich having ordered his forces to prepare all their baggage marched out and advanced towards the French camp The besiegers imagining they were to be attacked ran to their arms but Norwich sent a messenger to the duke reminding him of his engagement The duke who piqued himself on the faithful observance of his word exclaimed  I see the governor has outwitted me But let us be contented with gaining the place  And the English were allowed to pass thro' the camp unmolested  Froissart liv chap  After some other successes  the duke of Normandy laid siege to Aiguillon and as the natural strength of the fortress together with a brave garrison under the command of the earl of Pembroke and sir Walter Manny rendered it impossible to take the place by assault he proposed after making several fruitless attacks  Froissart liv chap  to reduce it by famine But before he could finish his enterprize he was called to another part of the kingdom by one of the greatest disasters that ever befel the French monarchy  Froissart liv chap    EDWARD informed by the earl of Derby of the great danger to which Guienne was exposed had prepared a fleet and army with which he intended in person to bring it relief He embarked at Southampton on board a fleet of near a thousand sail of all dimensions and carried with him besides all the chief nobility of England his eldest son the prince of Wales now fifteen years of age The winds proved long contrary  Avesbury p  and the King in despair of arriving in time at Guienne was at last persuaded by Geoffrey d'Harcourt to change the destination of his enterprize This nobleman was a Norman by birth had long made a considerable figure in the court of France and was generally esteemed for his personal merit and valour but being disobliged and persecuted by Philip he had fled over to England had recommended himself to Edward who was an excellent judge of men and had succeeded to Robert d'Artois in the invidious office of exciting and assisting the King in every enterprize against his native country He had long insisted that an expedition to Normandy promised in the present circumstances much more favourable success than one to Guienne that Edward would find the northern provinces much unfurnished of military force which had been drawn to the south that they were full of flourishing cities whose plunder would enrich the English that their cultivated fields as yet unspoiled by war would supply them with plenty of provisions and that the neighbourhood of the capital rendered every event of importance in those quarters  Froissart liv chap  These reasons which had not before been duly weighed by Edward began to make more impression after the disappointments which he had met with in his voyage to Guienne  th July Invasion of France  He ordered his fleet to sail to Normandy and safely disembarked his army at la Hogue  THIS army which was during the course of the ensuing campaign crowned with the most splendid success that ever attended the enterprize of any English monarch consisted of four thousand men at arms ten thousand archers ten thousand Welsh infantry and six thousand Irish The Welsh and the Irish were light disorderly troops fitter for doing execution in a pursuit or scouring the country than for any stable action The bow was always esteemed a frivolous weapon  where true military discipline was known and regular bodies of well armed foot maintained The only solid force in this army were the men at arms and even these being cavalry were on that account much inferior in the shock of battle to good infantry And as the whole were new levied troops we are led to entertain a very mean idea of the military force of those ages which being ignorant in every other art had not properly cultivated the art of war itself the sole object of their attention  THE King created the earl of Arundel constable of his army and the earls of Warwic and Harcourt mareschals He bestowed the honour of knighthood on the prince of Wales and several of the young nobility immediately upon his landing After destroying all the ships in la Hogue Barfleur and Cherbourg he spread his army over the whole country and gave them an unbounded licence of burning spoiling and plundering every place of which they became masters The loose discipline then practised could not be much hurt by these disorderly practices and Edward took care to prevent any surprize by giving orders to his troops however they might disperse themselves in the day time always to quarter themselves at night near the main body In this manner Montebourg Carentan St Lo Valognes and other places in the Cotentin were pillaged without resistance and an universal consternation was spread over the whole province  Froissart liv chap      THE intelligence of this unexpected invasion soon reached Paris and threw Philip into great perplexity He issued orders however for levying forces in all quarters and dispatched the count d'Eu constable of France and the count de Tancarville with a body of troops to the defence of Caen a populous and commercial but open city which lay in the neighbourhood of the English army The temptation of so rich a prize soon allured Edward to approach it and the inhabitants encouraged by their numbers and by the reinforcements which they daily received from the country ventured against the advice of the constable to meet him in the field But their courage failed them on the first shock They fled with precipitation The counts d'Eu and Tancarville were taken prisoners The victors entered the city along with the vanquished and a furious massacre commenced without distinction of age sex or condition The citizens in despair barricaded their houses and assaulted the English with stones bricks and every missile weapon The English made way by fire to the destruction of the citizens Till Edward anxious to save both his spoil and his soldiers stopped the massacre and having obliged the inhabitants to lay down their arms gave his troops licence to begin a more regular and less hazardous plunder of the city The pillage continued for three days The King reserved for his own share the  jewels plate silks fine cloth and fine linen and he bestowed all the remainder of the spoil on his army The whole was embarked on board the ships and sent over to England together with three hundred of the richest citizens of Caen whose ransom was an additional profit which he expected afterwards to levy'  Froissart  This dismal scene passed in the presence of two cardinal legates who had come to negociate a peace between the kingdoms  THE King moved next to Rouen in hopes of treating that city in the same manner but found that the bridge was already broken down and that the King of France himself was arrived there with his army He marched along the banks of the Seine towards Paris destroying the whole country and every town and village which he met with on his road  Froissart liv chap  Some of his light troops carried their ravages even to the gates of Paris and the royal palace of St Germans together with Nanterre Ruelle and other villages was reduced to ashes within sight of that capital The English proposed to pass the river at Poissy but found the French army encamped on the opposite banks and the bridge at that place as well as all others upon the Seine broken down by orders from Philip Edward now saw that the French intended to enclose him in their country in hopes of attacking him with advantage on all sides But he saved himself by a stratagem from this perilous situation He gave his army orders to dislodge and to advance farther up the seine but immediately returning by the same route arrived at Poissy which the enemy had already quitted in order to attend his motions He repaired the bridge with incredible celerity passed over his army and having thus disengaged himself from the enemy advanced by quick marches towards Flanders His vanguard commanded by Harcourt met with the townsmen of Amiens who were hastening to reinforce their King and defeated them with great slaughter  Froissart liv chap  He passed by Beauvais and burned the suburbs of that city But as he approached the Somme he found himself in the same difficulty as before All the bridges on that river were either broken down or strongly guarded An army under the command of Godemar de Faye was stationed on the opposite banks Philip was advancing on him from the other quarter with an army of an hundred thousand men And he was thus exposed to the danger of being enclosed and of starving in an enemy's country In this extremity he published a reward to any one that could bring him intelligence of a passage over the Somme A peasant called Gobin Agace whose rame has been preserved by the share which he had in these important transactions was tempted on this occasion to betray the interests of his country and he informed Edward of a ford below Abbeville which had a  sound bottom and might be passed without difficulty at low water  Froissart liv chap  The King hastened thither but found Godemar de Faye on the opposite banks Being urged by necessity he deliberated not a moment but threw himself into the river sword in hand at the head of his troops drove the enemy from their station and pursued them to a distance on the plain  Froissart liv chap  The French army under Philip arrived at the ford when the rear guard of the English were passing So narrow was the escape which Edward by his prudence and celerity made from this danger The rising of the tide prevented the French King from following him over the ford and obliged that prince to take his road over the bridge at Abbeville by which some time was lost  IT is natural to think that Philip at the head of so vast an army was impatient to take revenge of the English and to prevent the disgrace to which he must be exposed if an inferior enemy should be allowed after ravaging so great a part of his kingdom to escape with impunity Edward also was sensible that such must be the object of the French monarch and as he had advanced but a little way before his enemy he saw the danger of precipitating his march over the plains of Picardy and of exposing his rear to the insults of the numerous cavalry in which the French camp abounded  Battle of Crecy th August  He took therefore a very prudent resolution He chose his ground with advantage near the village of Crecy he disposed his army in excellent order he determined to await in tranquility the arrival of the enemy and he hoped that their eagerness to engage and to prevent his retreat after all their past disappointments would hurry them on to some rash and illconcerted action He drew up his army on a gentle ascent and divided them into three lines The first was commanded by the prince of Wales and under him by the earls of Warwic and Oxford by Harcourt and by the lords Chandos Holland and other noblemen The earls of Arundel and Northampton with the lords Willoughby Basset Roos and sir Lewis Tufton were at the head of the second line He took on himself the command of the third division by which he proposed either to bring succour to the two first lines or to secure a retreat in case of any misfortunes or to push his advantages against his enemy He had likewise the precaution to throw up trenches on his flank in order to secure himself from the numerous bodies of the French who might assail him from that quarter and he placed all his baggage behind him in a wood which he also secured by an intrenchment  Froissart liv chap    THE skill and order of this disposition with the tranquility in which it was made served extremely to compose the minds of the soldiers and the King that  he might farther inspirit them rode thro' their ranks with such an air of cheerfulness and alacrity in his countenance as conveyed the highest confidence into every beholder He pointed out to them the necessity to which they were at present reduced and the certain and inevitable destruction which awaited them if in their p  esent situation enclosed on all hands in an enemy's country they  cted to any thing but their own valour or gave that enemy an opportunity of raking revenge for the many insults and indignities which they had of late put upon him He reminded them of the apparent superiority which they had hitherto maintained over all the bodies of French troops who had fallen in their way and assured them that the greater numbers of the army which at present hovered over them gave them not greater force but was an advantage easily compensated by the order in which he had placed his own army and the resolution which he expected from them He demanded nothing he said but that they would imitate his own example and that of the prince of Wales and as the honour the lives the libert  es of all were now exposed to the same danger he was confident that they would make one common effort to extricate themselves from the present difficulties and that their united courage would give them the victory over all their enemies  IT is related by some historians  Jean Villani lib cap  that Edward besides the resources which he found in his own genius and presence of mind employed also a new invention against the enemy and placed in his front some pieces of artillery the first which had yet been made use of on any remarkable occasion in Europe This is the epoch of one of the most singular discoveries which has been made among men and which changed by degrees the whole art of war and by consequence many circumstances in the political government of Europe But the ignorance of that age in the mechanical arts rendered the progress very sow of this new invention The artillery first framed were so clumsy and of such difficult management that men were not immediately sensible of their use and efficacy And even to the present times improvements have been continually making on this furious engine which tho' it seemed contrived for the destruction of mankind and the overthrow of empires has in the issue rendered war much less bloody and has given greater stability to civil societies Nations by its means have been brought more to a level Conquests have become less frequent and rapid Success in war has been reduced nearly to be a matter of calculation And any nation overmarched by its enemy either yields to their demands or secures itself by alliances against their violence and invasion  THE invention of artillery was at this time known in France as well as in England  Du Cange Gloss in verb Bombarda  but Philip in his hurry to overtake the enemy had probably left his cannon behind him which he regarded as an useless incumbrance All his other movements discovered the same imprudence and precipitation Impelled by anger a dangerous counsellor and trusting to the great superiority of his numbers he thought that all depended on forcing an engagement with the English and that if he could once reach the enemy in their retreat the victory on his side was certain and inevitable He made a hasty march in great disorder from Abbeville but after he had advanced above two leagues some gentlemen whom he had sent before to take a view of the enemy returned to him and brought him intelligence that they had seen the English drawn up in excellent order and awaiting his arrival They therefore advised him to defer the combat till the ensuing day when his army would have recovered from their fatigue and might be disposed into better order than their present hurry had permitted them to observe Philip assented to this council but the former precipitation of his march and the impatience of the French nobility made it impracticable for him to put it in execution One division pressed upon another Orders to stop were not seasonably conveyed to all of them This immense body was not governed by sufficient discipline to be manageable And the French army very imperfectly formed into three lines arrived already fatigued and disordered in presence of the enemy The first line consisting of Genoese crossbow men were commanded by Anthony Doria and Charles Grimaldi The second was led by the count d'Alençon brother to the King The King himself was at the head of the third Besides the French monarch there were no less than three crowned heads in this engagement The King of Bohemia the King of the Romans his son and the King of Majorca with all the nobility and great vassals of the crown of France The army now consisted of above men near four times the number of the enemy But the prudence of one man was superior to the advantage of all this force and splendor  THE English on the approach of the enemy kept their ranks firm and immoveable and the Genoese first began the attack There had happened a little before the engagement a thunder shower which had moistened and relaxed the strings of the Genoese crossbows and their arrows for this reason fell short of the enemy The English archers taking their bows out of their cases poured in a shower of arrows upon this multitude who were opposed to them and soon threw them into disorder The Genoese fell back upon the Gensdarmes  of the count d'Alençon  Froissart liv chap    who enraged at their cowardice ordered his troops to pat them to the sword The artillery fired amidst the crowd the English archers still continued to send in their arrows among them and nothing was to be seen in that vast body but hurry and confusion terror and dismay The young prince of Wales had the presence of mind to take advantage of this situation and to lead on his line to the charge The French cavalry however recovering somewhat their order and encouraged by the example of their leader made stout resistance and having at last cleared themselves of the Genoese runaways advanced upon their adversaries and by their superior numbers began to hem them round The earls of Arundel and Northampton advanced their line to sustain the prince who ardent in his first feats of arms set an example of valour wh  ch was imitated by all his followers The battle became for some time hot and dangerous and the earl of Warwic apprehensive of the event from the superior numbers of the French dispatched an officer to the King and desired him to send succours to the relief of the prince Edward had chosen his station on the top of the hill and he surveyed in tranquillity the scene of action when the messenger accosted him His first question was whether the prince was slain or wounded On receiving an answer in the negative  Return  said he  to my son and tell him that I reserve the honour of this day to him I am confident that he will shew himself worthy of the honour of knighthood which I so lately conferred upon him He will be able without my assistance to repel the enemy  Froissart liv chap  This speech being reported to the prince and his attendants inspired them with new courage They made an attack with redoubled vigour on the French in which the count d'Alençon was slain That whole line of cavalry was thrown into disorder The riders were killed or dismounted The Welsh infantry rushed into the throng and with their long knives cut the throats of all who had fallen nor was any quarter given that day by the conquerors  Froissart liv chap    THE King of France advanced in vain with the rear to sustain the line commanded by his brother He found them already discomfited and the example or their rout encreased the confusion which was before but too prevalent in his own body He had himself a horse killed under him He was remounted and tho' left almost alone he seemed still determined to maintain the combat when John de Hainault seized the reins of his bridle turned about his horse and carried him off the field of battle The whole French army took to flight and were followed and put to the sword without mercy by the victors till the darkness of night put an end to the pursuit The King on his return to the camp flew into the arms of the prince of Wales and exclaimed  My brave son Persevere  in your honourable course You are my son for valiantly have you acquitted your self to day You have shown yourself worthy of em ire  Froissart liv chap      THIS battle which is known by the name of the battle of Crecy began after three o'clock in the afternoon and continued till evening The subsequent morning was foggy and as the English observed that many of the enemy had lost their way in the night and in the mist they employed a stratagem to bring them into their power They erected on the eminences some French standards which they had taken in battle and all who were allured by this false signal were put to the sword and no quarter given them In excuse for this inhumanity it was alledged that the French King had given out like orders to his troops but the real reason probably was that the English in their present situation did not care to be encumbered with prisoners On the day of battle and on the ensuing there fell by a moderate computation knights gentlemen men at arms besides about men of inferior rank  Froissart liv chap Knyghton p  Many of the principal nobility of France the dukes of Lorraine and Bourbon the earls of Flanders Blois Harcourt Vaudemont Aumale were left on the field of battle The Kings also of Bohemia and Majorca were slain The fate of the former was remarkable He was blind from age but being resolved to hazard his person and set an example to others he ordered the reins of his bridle to be tied on each side to the horses of two gentlemen of his train and his dead body and those of his attendants were afterwards found among the slain with their horses standing by them in that situation  Froissart liv chap Walsingham p    His crest was three ostrich feathers and his motto these German words  Ich dien I serve  Which the prince of Wales and his successors adopted in memorial of this great victory The action may seem no less remarkable for the small loss of the English than for the great slaughter of the French There were killed in it only one esquire and three knights  Knyghton p  and very few of inferior rank a demonstration that the prudent disposition made by Edward and the disorderly attack of the French had rendered the whole rather a rout than a battle which was indeed the common case with engagements in those times  THE great prudence of Edward appeared not only in obtaining this memorable victory but in the measures which he pursued after it Not elated by his present prosperity so far as to expect the total conquest of France or of any considerable provinces he proposed only to secure an easy entrance into that kingdom which might asterwards open the way to more moderate advantages He knew the extreme distance of Guienne He had experienced the difficulty and  uncertainty of penetrating on the side of the low countries and had already lost much of his authority over Flanders by the death of Arteville who had been murdered by the populace themselves his former partizans on his attempting to transfer the sovereignty of that province to the prince of Wales  Froissart liv Chap  The King therefore limited his ambition to the conquest of Calais and after the interval of a few days which he employed in interring the slain he marched with his victorious army and presented himself before that place  JOHN DE VIENNE a valiant knight of Burgundy was governor of Calais and being supplied with every necessary for defence he encouraged the townsmen to per  rm to the utmost their duty to their King and country Edward therefore sen  ble from the beginning that it was in vain to attempt the place by force proposed only to reduce it by famine He chose a secure station for his camp drew entrenchments around the whole city raised huts for his soldiers which he covered with straw or broom and provided his army with all conveniencies to make them endure the winter season which was approaching As the governor soon perceived his intention he put out all the useless mouths which might consume his provisions and the King had the generosity to allow these unhappy people to pass thro' his camp and he even supplied them with money for their journey  Froissart liv chap    WHILE Edward was employed in this siege which continued near a twelvemonth there passed in different places many other events and all to the honour or the English arms  THE retreat of the duke of Normandy from Guienne left the earl of Derby master of the field and he was not negligent in making his advantage of the superior  ty He took Mirebeau by assault He made himself master of Lusignan in the same manner Taillebourg and St Jean d'Angeli fell into his hands Poictiers opened its gates to him and Derby having thus broke down all the frontiers on that quarter carried his incursions to the banks of the Loire and filled that quarter of France with horrour and devastation  Froissart liv      THE flames of war were at the same time kindled in Brittany Charles de Blois invaded that province with a considerable army and invested the fortress of Roche de Rien but the countess of Mountfort reinforced by some English troops under Sir Thomas Dagworth attacked him during the night in his entrenchments dispersed his army and took himself prisoner  liv chap Walsingham p  Ypod Neust p  His wife by whom he  yed his pretensions to Brittany compelled by the present necessity  took on her the government of the party and proved herself a rival in every shape and an antagonist to the countess of Mountfort both in the field and in the cabinet And while these heroic dames presented this extraordinary scene to the world another princess in England of still higher rank showed herself no less capable of exerting every manly virtue  War with Scotland  THE Scottish nation after supporting with incredible perseverance their liberties against the superior force of the English recalled their King David Bruce in Tho' that prince neither by his age nor capacity could bring them great assistance he gave them the countenance of sovereign authority and as Edward's wars with France proved a great diversion to his forces they rendered the ballance more equal between the two kingdoms In all the truces which Edward concluded with Philip the King of Scotland was comprehended and when Edward made his last invasion upon France David was strongly sollicited by his ally to break also the truce and to invade the northern counties of England The nobility of his nation being always forward in such incursions David soon mustered a great army entered Northumberland at the head of above men and carried his ravages and devastations to the gates of Durham  Froissart liv chap  But queen Phillippa assembling a body of little more than men  Froissart liv chap  which she entrusted to the command of lord Piercy ventured to approach him at Neville's Cross near that city and riding thro' the ranks of the army exhorted every man to do his duty and to take revenge on these barbarous ravagers  Froissart liv chap    th Octr  Nor could she be persuaded to leave the field till the armies were on the point of engaging The Scots have been often unfortunate in the great pitched battles which they fought with the English and that tho' they commonly declined such engagements where the superiority of numbers was not on their side But never did they receive a more fatal blow than the present They were broke and chaced off the field Fifteen thousand of them some historians say twenty thousand were slain among whom were Edward Keith earl Mareschal and Sir Thomas Charteris chancellor  Captivity of the King of Scots  And the King himself was taken prisoner with the earls of Southerland Fife Monteith Carric lord Douglas and many other noblemen  Froissart liv chap    PHILLIPPA having secured her royal prisoner in the Tower  Rymer vol p  crossed the sea at Dover and was received in the English camp before Calais with all the triumph which was due to her rank her merit and her success This age was the reign of chivalry and gallantry Edward's court excelled in these accomplishments as much as in policy and arms And if any thing could justify the obsequious  devotion then professed to the fair sex it must be the appearance of such extraordinary women as shone forth during that period  Calais taken  THE town of Calais had been defended with remarkable vigilance constancy and bravery by the townsmen during a siege of unusual length But Philip informed of their distrest condition determined at last to attempt their relief and he approached the English with an immense army which the writers of that age make amount to men But he found Edward so surrounded with morasses and secured by entrenchments that without running on inevitable destruction he concluded it impossible to make an attempt on the English camp He had no other resource than to send his rival a vain challenge to meet him in the open field which being refused he was obliged to decamp with his army and disperse them into their several provinces  Froissart liv chap Avesbury p    JOHN DE VIENNE the governor of Calais now saw the necessity of surrendering his fortress which was reduced to the last extremity by famine and the fatigue of the inhabitants He appeared on the walls and made a signal to the English sentinels that he desired a conference Sir Walter Manny was sent to him by Edward  "Brave knight"  cried the governor  "I have been entrusted by my sovereign with the command of this town It is almost a year since you besieged me and I have endeavoured as well as those under me to do our duty But you are acquainted with our present condition We have no hopes of relief we are perishing with hunger I am willing therefore to surrender and desire as the sole condition to ensure the lives and liberties of these brave men who have so long shared with me every danger and fatigue  Froissart liv chap    MANNY replied that he was well acquainted with the King of England's intentions that that prince was incensed against the townsmen of Calais for their pertinacious resistance and for the evils which they had made him and his subjects suffer that he was determined to take exemplary vengeance of them and would not receive the town on any conditions which should confine him in the punishment of these offenders  "Consider"  replied Vienne  "that this is not the treatment to which brave men are intitled If any English knight had been in my situation your King would have expected the same conduct from him The inhabitants of Calais have done for their sovereign what merits the esteem of every prince much more of so gallant a prince as Edward But I inform you that if we must perish we shall not perish unrevenged and that we are not yet so reduced but we can sell our lives at a high price to the victors  It is the interest of both sides to prevent these desperate extremities and I expect that you yourself brave knight will interpose your good offices with your prince in our behalf"  MANNY was struck with the justness of these sentiments and represented to the King the danger of reprizals if he should give such treatment to the inhabitants of Calais Edward was at last persuaded to mitigate the rigor of the conditions demanded He only insisted that six of the most considerable citizens should be sent him to be disposed of as he thought proper that they should come to his camp carrying the keys of the city in their hand bareheaded and barefooted with ropes about their necks And on these conditions he promised to spare the lives of all the remainder  Froissart liv chap    WHEN this intelligence was conveyed to Calais it struck the inhabitants with new consternation To sacrifice six of their fellow citizens to certain destruction for signalizing their valour in a common cause appeared to them even more severe than that general punishment with which they were before threatened and they found themselves incapable of coming to any resolution in so cruel and distressful a situation At last one of the principal inhabitants called Eustace de St Pierre whose name deserves to be recorded stept forth and declared himself willing to encounter death for the safety of his friends and companions Another animated by his example made a like generous offer A third and a fourth presented themselves to the same fate and the whole number required was soon compleated These six heroic burgesses appeared before Edward in the guise of malefactors laid at his feet the keys of their city and were ordered to be led to execution It is surprizing that so generous a prince should ever have entertained such a barbarous purpose against such men and still more that he should seriously persist in the resolution of executing it  This story of the six burghers of Calais like all other extraordinary stories is somewhat to be suspected and so much the more as Avesbury p who is particular in his narration of the surrender of Calais says nothing of it and on the contrary extols in general the King's generosity and lenity to the inhabitants  But the entreaties of his queen saved his memory from that infamy She threw herself on her knees before him and with tears in her eyes begged the lives of these citizens Having obtained her request she carried them into her tent ordered a repast to be set before them and after making them a present of money and cloaths dismissed them in safety  Froissart liv chap    th Aug  THE King took possession of Calais and immediately executed an act of rigor more justifiable because more necessary than that which he had before resolved on He knew that notwithstanding his pretended title to the crown  of France every Frenchman regarded him as a mortal enemy and he therefore ordered all the inhabitants of Calais to evacuate the town and he peopled it anew with English a policy which probably preserved so long to his successors the dominion of that important fortress He made it the staple of wool leather tin and lead the four chief if not the sole commodities of the kingdom for which there was any demand in foreign markets All the English were obliged to bring thither these goods Foreign merchants came to the same place in order to purchase them And at a period when posts were not established and when the communication between states was so imperfect this institution tho' it hurt the navigation of England was perhaps of advantage to the kingdom  THRO' the mediation of the Pope's legates Edward concluded a truce with France but even during this cessation of arms he had very nearly lost Calais the sole fruit of all his boasted victories The King had entrusted that place to the command of Aimery de Pavie an Italian who had discovered bravery and conduct in the wars but was utterly devoid of every principle of honour and fidelity This man agreed to deliver up Calais for the sum of crowns and Geoffrey de Charni who commanded the French forces in those quarters and who knew that if he succeeded in this service he should not be disavowed ventured without consulting his master to conclude the bargain with him Edward informed of this treachery by means of Aimery's secretary summoned him over to London on other pretences and having charged him with the guilt promised him his life but on condition that he would turn the contrivance to the destruction of the enemy The Italian easily agreed to this double treachery A day was appointed for the admission of the French and Edward having prepared a force of about a thousand men under sir Walter Manny secretly departed from London carrying with him the prince of Wales and without being suspected arrived the eveni  g before at Calais He made a proper disposition for the reception of the enemy and kept all his forces and the garrison under arms On the appearance of Charni a chosen troop of French soldiers was admitted at the postern and Aimery receiving the stipulated sum promised that with their assistance he would immediately open the great gate to the army who were waiting with impatience for the fulfilling of his engagement All the French who entered were immediately slain or taken prisoners The great gate opened Edward rushed forth with cries of battle and of victory  st January  The French tho' astonished at this event behaved with valour A fierce and bloody engagement ensued As the morning broke the King who was not distinguished by his arms and who fought as a private man under the standard of sir Walter Manny remarked a  French gentleman called Eustace de Ribaumont who exerted himself with singular vigour and bravery and he was seized with a desire of trying a single combat with him He stept forth from his troop and challenging Ribaumont by name for he was known to him began a sharp and dangerous encounter He was twice beat to the ground by the valour of the Frenchman He twice recovered himself Blows were redoubled with equal force on both sides The victory was long undecided Till Ribaumont perceiving himself to be left almost alone called out to his antagonist  Sir knight I yield myself your prisoner  and at the same time delivered his sword to the King Most of the French being overpowered by numbers and intercepted in their retreat were either slain or taken prisoners  Froissart liv chap    THE French officers who had fallen into the hands of the English were conducted into Calais where Edward discovered to them the antagonist with whom they had had the honour to be engaged and treated them with great regard and courtesy They were admitted to sup with the prince of Wales and the English nobility and after supper the King himself came into the apartment and went about conversing familiarly with one or other of his prisoners He even addressed himself in an obliging manner to Charni and avoided reproaching him with the treacherous attempt which he had made upon Calais during the truce But he openly bestowed the highest encomiums on Ribaumont called him the most valorous knight whom he had ever been acquainted with and confessed that he had at no time been in so great danger as when engaged in combat with him He then took a string of pearl which he wore about his own head and throwing it over the head of Ribaumont he said to him  "Sir Eustace I bestow this present upon you as a testimony of my esteem for your bravery And I desire you to wear it a year for my sake I know you to be gay and amorous and to take delight in the company of laides and damsels Let them all know from what hand you had the present You are no longer a prisoner I acquit you of your ransom and you are at liberty tomorrow to dispose of yourself as you think proper"  NOTHING can more evidently prove the vast superiority of the nobility and gentry above all the other orders of men during those ages than the extreme difference which Edward made in his treatment of these French knights and that of the six citizens of Calais who had exerted much more signal bravery in a cause much more justifiable and more honourable  CHAP XVI EDWARD III  Institution of the garterState of

of the prince of WalesDeathand character of the KingMiscellaneous transactions in this reign  THE prudent conduct and great success of Edward in his foreign wars had excited a strong emulation and a military genius among the English nobility and these turbuient barons overawed by the crown gave now a more useful direction to their ambition and attached themselves to a prince who led them to the acquisition of glory and of riches  That he might further promote the spirit of emulation and obedience the King instituted the order of the garter in imitation of some orders of a like nature religious as well as military which had been established in different countries of Europe  Institution of the garter  The number received into this order consisted of twentyfour persons besides the sovereign and as it has never been enlarged this badge of distinction continues as honourable as at its first institution and is still a valuable tho' a cheap present which the prince can confer on his greatest subjects A vulgar story prevails but is not supported by any antient authority that at a courtball Edward's mistress commonly supposed to be the countess of Salisbury dropt her garter and the King taking it up observed some of the courtiers to smile as if he had not obtained this favour merely by accident Upon which he called out  Honi soit qui mal y pense  Evil to him that evil thinks and as every incident of gallantry among these antient warriors was magnified into a matter of great importance  There was a singular instance about this time of the prevalence of chivalry and gallantry in the nations of Europe A solemn duel of thirty knights against thirty was fought between Bembrough an English men and Beaumanoir a Breton of the party of Charles de Blois The knights of the two nations came into the field and before the combat began Beaumanoir called out that it would be seen that day  who had    After a bloody combat the Bretons prevailed and gained for their prize full liberty to boast their mistresses beauty It is remarkable that two such famous generals as sir Robert Knolle  and sir Hugh Calverley drew their swords in this ridiculous contest See Pere Daniel vol p  c The women not only instigated the champions to these rough if not bloody frays of tournament but also frequented the tournaments during all the reign of Edward whose spirit of gallantry encouraged this practice See Knyghton p  he instituted the  order of the garter in memorial of this event and gave these words as the motto of the order This origin tho' frivolous is not unsuitable to the manners of the times and it is indeed difficult by any other means to account either for the seemingly unmeaning terms of the motto or for the peculiar badge of the garter which seems to have no reference to any purpose either of military use or ornament  BUT a sudden damp was thrown over this festivity and triumph of the court of England by a destructive pestilence which invaded that kingdom as well as the rest of Europe and is computed to have swept away above a fourth of the inhabitants in every country which it attacked It was probably more fatal in great cities than in the country and above fifty thousand souls are said to have perished by it in London alone  Stow's Survey p There were buried bodies in one church yard which sir Walter Manny had bought for the use of the poor The same author says that there died above persons of the plague in Norwich which is quite incredible  This malady discovered itself first in the north of Asia was spread over all that country made a progress from one end of Europe to another and sensibly depopulated every state thro' which it passed So grievous a calamity more than any cordiality among the princes served to maintain and prolong the truce between France and England  DURING this truce Philip de Valois died without being able to reestablish the affairs of France which his bad success against England had thrown into the most extreme disorder This monarch during the first years of his reign had obtained the appellation of  Fortunate  and acquired the character of prudent but he ill maintained either the one or the other less from his own fault than because he was overmatched by the superior fortune and superior genius of Edward But the incidents in the reign of his son John gave the French nation reason to regret even the calamitous times of his predecessor John was distinguished by many virtues particularly a scrupulous honour and fidelity He was not deficient in personal courage But as he wanted that masterly prudence and foresight which his difficult situation required his kingdom was at the same time torn in pieces by intestine commotions and oppressed with foreign wars  State of France  The chief source of all its calamities was Charles King of Navarre who received the epithet of the  bad  or  wicked  and whose actions fully entitled him to that appellation This prince was descended of the blood royal of France his mother was a daughter of Lewis Hutin he had himself espoused a daughter of King John But all these ties which ought to have connected him with the throne gave him only greater ability to shake and over throw it In his personal qualities he was  courteous affable engaging eloquent full of insinuation and address inexhaustible in his resources active and enterprizing But these splendid accomplishments were at the same time attended with such defects as rendered them pernicious to his country and even ruinous to himself He was fickle inconstant faithless revengeful malicious Restrained by no principle or duty Insatiable in his pretensions And whether successful or unfortunate in one enterprize he immediately undertook another in which he was never deterred from employing the most criminal and most dishonourable expedients  THE constable d'Eu who had been taken prisoner by Edward at Caen recovered his liberty on the promise of delivering to that prince as his ransom the town of Ghisnes near Calais of which he was superior lord But as John was offended at this stipulation which if fulfilled opened still farther that frontier to the enemy and as he suspected the constable of more dangerous connexions with the King of England he ordered him to be seized and without any legal or formal trial put him to death in p  son Charles de la Cerda was appointed constable in his place and had a like fatal end The King of Navarre ordered him to be assassinated and such was the weakness of the crown that this prince instead of dreading punishment would not so much as agree to ask pardon for his offence but on condition that he received an accession of territory and had John's second son put into his hands as a security for his person when he came to court and performed this act of mock penitence and humiliation before King John  Froisssart liv chap    THE two French princes seemed entirely reconciled but this dissimulation to which John submitted from necessity and Charles from habit did not long continue and the King of Navarre knew that he had reason to apprehend the most severe vengeance for the many crimes and treasons which he had already committed and the still greater which he intended to commit To ensure himself of protection he entered into a secret correspondence with England by means of Henry earl of Derby now earl of Lancaster who at that time was employed in fruitless negotiations for peace in Avignon under the mediation of the Pope John discovered this correspondence and to prevent the fatal effects of it he sent down forces into Normandy the chief seat of the King f Navarre's power an attacked his castles and fortresses But hearing that Edward had prepared an army to support his allly he had the weakness to propose an accommodation with Charles and even to give this traiterous subject the sum of an hundred thousand crowns as the purchase of a reigned reconcilement which rendered him still more dangerous The  King of Navarre insolent from past impunity and desperate from the dangers which he apprehended continued still his intrigues and associating himself with Geoffrey de Harcourt who had received his pardon from Philip de Valois but persevered still in his factious dispositions he encreased the number of his partizans in every part of the kingdom He even seduced by his address Charles the King of France's eldest son a youth of seventeen years of age who was the first that bore the appellation of Dauphin by the reunion of the province of Dauphiny to the crown But this prince being made sensible of the danger and folly of these connexions promised to make atonement for the offence by the sacrifice of his associates and in concert with his father he invited the King of Navarre and other noblemen of the party to a feast at Roüen where they were betrayed into the hands of John Some of the most obnoxious were immediately led to execution the King of Navarre was thrown into prison  Froissart liv chap Avesbury p  But this stroke of severity in the King and of treachery in the Dauphin was far from proving decisive in maintaining the royal authority Philip of Navarre brother to Charles and Geoffrey d'Harcourt put all the towns and castles belonging to that prince in a posture of defence and had immediate recourse to the protection of England in this desperate extremity  THE truce between the two kingdoms which had always been very ill observed on both sides was now expired and Edward was entirely free to support the French malecontents Well pleased that the factions in France had at last gained him some partizans in that kingdom which his pretensions to the crown had never been able to procure him he proposed to attack his enemy both on the side of Guienne under the command of the prince of Wales and on that of Calais in his own person  YOUNG Edward arrived in the Garonne with his army on board a fleet of three hundred sail attended by the earls of Warwic Salisbury Oxford Suffolk and other English noblemen Being joined by the vassals of Gascony he took the field and as the present disorders in John's affairs prevented every proper plan of defence he carried on with impunity his ravages and devastations according to the mode of war in that age He reduced all the villages and several towns in Languedoc to ashes He presented himself before Tholouse passed the Garronne and burned the suburbs of Carcassonne advanced even to Narbonne laying every thing waste around him And after an incursion of six weeks returned with a vast booty and many prisoners to Guienne where he took up his winter quarters  Froissart liv chap  The constable of Bourbon who commanded in those provinces received orders  though at the head of a superior army on no account to run the hazard of a battle  THE King of England's incursion from Calais was of the same nature and  ed with the same issue He broke into France at the head of a numerous army to whom he gave a full licence of plundering and ravaging the open country He advanced to St Omer where the King of France was posted and on the retreat of that prince followed him to Hesdin  chap Avesbury p Walsing p  John still kept at a distance and declined an engagement But in order to save his reputation he sent Edward a challenge to fight a pitched battle with him an usual bravado in that age derived from the practice of single combat and ridiculous in the art of war The King finding no sincerity in this defiance retired to Calais and thence went over to England in order to defend that kingdom against a threatened invasion of the Scots  THE Scots taking advantage of the King's absence and that of the military power of England had surprized Berwic and had collected an army with a view of entering and committing ravages upon the northern provinces But on the approach of Edward they abandoned that place which was not tenable while the castle was in the hands of the English and retiring to their mountains gave the enemy a full liberty of burning and destroying the whole country from Berwic to Edinburgh  Walsing p  Baliol attended Edward on this expedition but finding that his constant adherence to the English had given his countrymen an unconquerable aversion to his title and that he himself was declining through age and infirmities he finally resigned into the King's hands his pretensions to the crown of Scotland  Rymer vol p  Ypod Neust p  and received in lieu of them an annual pension of pounds with which he passed the remainder of his life in privacy and retirement  DURING these military operations Edward received information of the encreasing disorders in France arising from the seizure of the King of Navarre and he sent Lancaster at the head of a small army to support his partizans in Normandy The war was conducted with various success but chiefly to the disadvantage of the French malecontents till an important event happened in the other quarter of the kingdom which had well nigh proved fatal to the monarchy of France and threw every thing into the utmost confusion  THE prince of Wales encouraged by the success of the preceding campaign took the field with an army which no historian makes amount to above  men and of which not a third were English and with this small body he ventured to penetrate into the heart of France After ravaging the Agenois Quercy and the Limousin he entered the province of Berry and made some attacks tho' without success on the towns of Bourges and Issoudun It appeared that his intentions were to march into Normandy and join his forces to those of the duke of Lancaster and the partizans of the King of Navarre but finding all the bridges on the Loire broke down and every pass carefully guarded he was obliged to think of making his retreat into Guienne  Walsing p  He found this resolution the more necessary from the intelligence which he received of the King of France's motions That monarch provoked at the insult offered him by this incursion and entertaining hopes of success from the young prince's temerity collected a great army of above men and advanced with hasty marches to intercept his enemy The prince not aware of John's near approach lost some days on his retreat before the castle of Remorantin  Froissart liv chap Walsing p  and thereby gave the French an opportunity of overtaking him  Battle of Poictiers  They came within sight at Maupertuis near Poictiers and Edward sensible that his retreat was now become impracticable prepared for battle with all the courage of a young hero and with all the prudence of the oldest and most experienced commander  BUT the utmost prudence and courage would have proved insufficient to save him in this extremity had the King of France known how to make use of his present advantages His vast superiority in numbers enabled him to surround the enemy and by intercepting all their provisions which were already become scarce in the English camp to reduce this small army without a blow to the necessity of surrendering at discretion But such was the impatient ardour of the French nobility and so much had their thoughts been bent on overtaking the English as their sole object that this idea never struck any of the commanders and they immediately prepared themselves for the assault as for a certain victory While the French army was drawn up in order of battle they were stopped by the appearance of the cardinal of Perigord who having learned the approach of the two armies to each other had hastened by interposing his good offices to prevent any farther effusion of Christian blood By John's permission he carried proposals to the prince of Wales and found him so sensible of the bad posture of his affairs that an accommodation seemed not impracticable Edward told him that he would agree to any terms consistent with his own honour and that of England and he offered to purchase a retreat by resigning all the conquests which he had made during this and the former campaign and by stipulating not to serve against France during the course of seven years But John imagining that he had  now got into his hands a sufficient pledge for the restitution of Calais required that Edward should surrender himself prisoner with an hundred of his attendants and offered on these terms a safe retreat to the English army The prince rejected the proposal with disdain and declared that whatever fortune should attend him England should never be obliged to pay the price of his ransom This resolute answer cut off all hopes of accommodation but as the day was already spent in negociating the battle was delayed till the next morning  Froissart liv chap    THE cardinal of Perigord as all the prelates of the court of Rome was extremely attached to the French cause but the most determined enemy could not have contrived a greater prejudice to John's affairs than he did them by this delay  th Sept  The prince of Wales had leisure during the night to strengthen by new entrenchments the post which he had before so judiciously chosen and he contrived an ambush of men at arms and as many archers whom he put under the command of the Captal de Buche and ordered to make a circuit that they might fall on the flank or rear of the French army during the engagement The van of his army was commanded by the earl of Warwic the rear by the earls of Salisbury and Suffolk the main body by the prince himself The lords Chandos Audeley and many other brave and experienced commanders were at the head of different corps of his army  JOHN also arranged his forces in three divisions nearly equal The first was commanded by the duke of Orleans the King's brother the second by the Dauphin attended with his two younger brothers the third by the King himself who had by his side Philip his fourth son and favourite then about fourteen years of age There was no reaching the English army but thro' a narrow lane covered on each side by hedges and in order to open this passage the mareschals Andrehen and Clermont were ordered to advance with a separate detachment of men at arms While they marched along the lane a body of English archers who lined the hedges plyed them on each side with their arrows and being very near them yet placed in perfect safety they coolly took their aim against the enemy and massacred them with impunity The French detachment much discouraged with the unequal fight and diminished in their number arrived at the end of the lane where they met on the open grounds the prince of Wales himself at the head of a chosen body ready for their reception They were discomfited and overthrown One of the mareschals was slain another taken prisoner And the remainder of the detachment who were still in the lane and exposed to the shot of the enemy without being able to make resistance  recoiled upon their own army and put every thing into disorder  Froissart liv chap  In that critical moment the Captal de Buche unexpectedly appeared and attacked in flank the Dauphin's line which fell into some confusion Landas Bodenai and St Venant to whom the care of that young prince and his brothers had been committed too anxious for their charge or for their own safety carried them off the field to Chauvigny and set the example of flight which was followed by that whole division The duke of Orleans seized with a like panic and imagining all was lost thought no longer of fighting but carried off his division by a retreat which soon turned also into a slight The lord Chandos called out to the prince that the day was won and encouraged him to attack the division under King John which tho' more numerous than the whole English army were somewhat dismayed with the precipitate flight of their companions John here made the utmost efforts to retrieve by his valour what his imprudence had betrayed and the only resistance made that day was by his line of battle The prince of Wales fell with impetuosity on some German cavalry placed in the front and commanded by the counts of Sallebruche Nydo and Nosto A fierce battle ensued The one side were encouraged by the near prospect of so great a victory The other side were retained by the shame of quitting the field to an enemy so much inferior But the three German generals together with the duke of Athens constable of France falling in battle that body of cavalry gave way and left the King himself exposed to the whole fury of the enemy The ranks were every moment thinned around him The nobles fell by his side one after another His son scarce fourteen years of age received a wound while he was fighting valiantly in defence of his father The King himself spent with fatigue and overwhelmed by numbers might easily have been dispatched but every English gentleman ambitious of taking alive the royal prisoner spared him in the action called to him to surrender himself and offered him quarter Several who attempted to seize him suffered for their temerity He still cried out  Where is my cousin the prince of Wales  and seemed unwilling to become prisoner to any person of inferior rank  Captivity of the King of France  But being told that the prince was at a great distance on the field he threw down his gauntlet and yielded himself to Dennis de Morbec a knight of Arras who had been obliged to fly his country for murder His son was taken with him  Rymer vol p Froissart liv chap    THE prince of Wales who had been carried away in pursuit of the flying enemy finding the field entirely clear had ordered a tent to be pitched and was reposing himself after the toils of battle enquiring still with great anxiety concerning the fate of the French monarch He dispatched the earl of Warwic to  bring him intelligence and that nobleman came happily in time to save the life of the captive prince which was exposed to greater danger than it had been during the heat of action The English had taken him by violence from Morbec The Gascons claimed the honour of detaining the prisoner And some brutal soldiers rather than yield the prize to their rivals had threatened to put him to death  Froissart liv chap  Warwic overawed both parties and approaching the King with great demonstrations of respect offered to conduct him to the prince's tent  HERE commences the real and truly admirable heroism of Edward For victories are vulgar things in comparison of that moderation and humanity discovered by a young prince of twenty seven years of age not yet cooled from the fury of battle and elated by as extraordinary and as unexpected success as had ever crowned the arms of any general He came forth to meet the captive King with all the signs of regard and sympathy administered comfort to him amidst his misfortunes paid him the tribute of praise due to his valour and ascribed his own victory merely to the blind chance of war or to a superior providence which controuls all the efforts of human force and prudence  Paull Oemil p  The behaviour of John showed him not unworthy of this courteous treatment His present abject fortune never made him forget a moment that he was a King More sensible to Edward's generosity than to his own calamities he confessed that notwithstanding his defeat and captivity his honour was still unimpaired and that if he yielded the victory it was at least gained by a prince of such consummate valour and humanity  EDWARD ordered a magnificent repast to be prepared in his tent for the prisoners and he himself served the royal captive's table as if he had been one of his retinue He stood at the King's back during the meal constantly refused to take a place at table and declared that being a subject he was too well acquainted with the distance between his own rank and that of royal majesty to assume such freedom All his father's pretensions to the crown of France were now buried in oblivion John in captivity received the honours of a King which were refused him when seated on the throne His misfortunes not his title were respected And the French prisoners conquered by this elevation of mind more than by their late discomfiture burst out into tears of joy and admiration which were only checked by the reflection that such genuine and unaltered heroism in an enemy must certainly in the issue prove but the more dangerous to their native country  Froissart liv chap    ALL the English and Gascon knights imitated the generous example set them by their prince The captives were every where treated with humanity and were soon after dismissed on paying moderate ransoms to the persons into whose hands they had fallen The extent of their fortunes was considered and no more was exacted of them than what would still leave them sufficient to enable them for the future to perform their military service in a manner suitable to their rank and quality Yet so numerous were the noble prisoners that these ransoms joined to the spoils of the field were sufficient to enrich the prince's army and as they had suffered very little in the action their joy and exulation was compleat  THE prince of Wales conducted his prisoner to Bourdeaux and not being provided of forces so numerous as might enable him to push his present advantages he concluded a two years truce with France  Rymer vol p  which was also become requisite that he might conduct the captive King with safety into England  th May  He landed at Southwark and was met by a prodigious concourse of people of all ranks and stations The prisoner was clad in royal apparel and mounted on a white steed distinguished by its size and beauty and by the richness of its furniture The conqueror rode by his side in a meaner attire and carried by a black palfry In this situation much more glorious than all the insolent parade of a Roman triumph he passed thro' the streets of London and presented the King of France to his father who advanced to meet him and received him with the same courtesy as if he had been a neighbouring potentate who had voluntarily come to pay him a friendly visit  Froissart liv chap  It is impossible in reflecting on this noble conduct not to perceive the advantages which resulted from the otherwise whimsical principles of chivalry and which gave men in those rude times some superiority even over people of a more cultivated age and nation  THE King of France besides the generous treatment which he met with in England had the melancholy consolation of the wretched to see their companions in affliction The King of Scots had been eleven years a captive in Edward's hands and the good fortune of this monarch had reduced at once the two neighbouring potentates with whom he was engaged in war to be prisoners in his capital But Edward finding that the conquest of Scotland was no wife advanced by the captivity of its sovereign and that the government conducted by Robert Stuart his heir and nephew was still able to defend itself consented to restore David Bruce to his liberty for the ransom of marks sterling and that prince delivered the sons of all his principal nobility as hostages for the payment  Rymer vol p  Froissart liv chap Walsingham p    State of France  MEANWHILE the captivity of John joined to the preceding disorders of the French government had produced in that country a dissolution almost total of civil authority and had occasioned confusions the most horrible and destructive which had ever been experienced in any age or in any nation The Dauphin now about eighteen years of age naturally assumed the royal power during his father's captivity but tho' endowed with excellent abilities even in such early years he possessed neither the experience nor authority requisite to defend a state assailed at once by foreign power and shaken by internal factions In order to obtain supply he assembled the states of the kingdom That assembly instead of supporting his administration were themselves seized with the spirit of confusion and laid hold of the present opportunity to demand limitations of the prince's power the punishment of past malversations and the liberty of the King of Navarre Marcel provost of the merchants and first magistrate of Paris put himself at the head of the unruly populace and from the violence and temerity of his character pushed them to commit the most criminal outrages against the royal authority They detained the Dauphin in a sort of captivity they murdered in his presence Robert de Clermont and John de Conflans mareschals of France they threatened all the other ministers with a like fate and when Charles who was obliged to temporize and dissemble made his escape from their hands they levied war against him and openly erected the standard of rebellion The other cities of the kingdom in imitation of the capital shook off the Dauphin's authority took the government into their own hands and spread the disorder into every province The nobles whose inclinations led them to adhere to the crown and were naturally disposed to check these tumults had lost all their influence and being reproached with cowardice on account of the base desertion of their sovereign in the battle of Poictiers were treated with universal contempt by the inferior orders The troops who from the deficiency of pay were no longer retained in discipline threw off all regard to their officers sought the means of subsistance by pillage and robbery and associating to them all the disorderly people with which that age abounded formed numerous bands which infested all quarters of the kingdom They laid the open country desolate burned and plundered the villages and by cutting off all means of communication or subsistence reduced even the inhabitants of the walled towns to the most extreme necessity The peasants formerly oppressed and now left unprotected by their masters became desperate from their present misery and rising every where in arms carried to the last extremity those disorders which were derived from the sedition of the citizens and disbanded soldiers  Froissart liv chap  The gentry hated for their tyranny were every where  exposed to the violence of popular rage and instead of meeting with regard for their past dignity became only on that account the object of more wanton insult to the mutinous peasants They were hunted like wild beasts and put to the sword without mercy Their castles were consumed with fire and levelled to the ground Their wives and daughters were first ravished and then murdered The savages proceeded so far as to impale some gentlemen and roast them alive before a slow fire A body of nine thousand of them broke into Meaux where the wife of the Dauphin with above ladies had taken shelter The most brutal treatment and most atrocious cruelty were justly dreaded by this helpless company But the Captal de Buche tho' in the service of Edward yet moved by generosity and by the gallantry of a true knight flew to their relief and beat off the peasants with great slaughter In other civil wars the opposite factions falling under the government of their several leaders commonly preserve still the vestige of some rule and order But here the wild state of nature seemed to be renewed Every man was thrown loose and independant from his fellows And the great multitude of people which had arisen from the preceding police of civil society served only to encrease the horrour and confusion of the scene  AMIDST these disorders the King of Navarre made his escape from prison and presented a dangerous leader to the furious malecontents  Froissart liv chap  But the splendid talents of this prince qualified him only to do mischief and to encrease the public confusions He wanted the steddiness and prudence requisite for making his intrigues subservient to his ambition and forming his numerous partizans into a regular faction He revived his pretensions somewhat obsolete to the crown of France and indeed if female succession was to be admitted his mother the daughter of Lewis Hutin brought him undoubtedly the only lawful title and stood before Isabella the mother of Edward in the course of descent But while he advanced this claim he relied entirely on his alliance with the English who were concerned in interest to disappoint his pretensions and who being public and inveterate enemies to the state served only by the friendship which they seemingly bore him to render his cause the more odious And in all his operations he acted more like a leader of banditti than one who aspired to be the head of a regular government and who was engaged by his station to endeavour the reestablishment of order in the community  THE eyes therefore of all the French who wished to restore peace to their miserable and desolated country were turned towards the Dauphin and that  young prince tho' not remarkable for his military talents possessed so much prudence and spirit that he gained daily the ascendant over all his enem es Marcel the seditious provost was slain while he was attempting to deliver the city to the King of Navarre and the English and the capital immediately returned to its duty  Froissart liv chap  The most considerable bodies of the mutinous peasants were dissipated and put to the sword Some bands of military robbers underwent the same fate And tho' many grievous disorders still remained France began gradually to assume the face of a regular civil government and to form some plan for its defence and security  DURING the confusion in the Dauphin's affairs Edward seemed to have a favourable opportunity of pushing his conquests But besides that his hands were tied by the truce and he could only assist underhand the faction of Navarre the state of the English finances and military power during those ages rendered the kingdom incapable of making any regular or steddy effort and obliged it to exert its force at very distant intervals by which all the projected ends were commonly disappointed Edward employed himself during a conjuncture so inviting chiefly in negotiations with his prisoner and John had the weakness to sign terms of peace which had they taken effect must have totally ruined and dismembered his kingdom He agreed to restore all the provinces which had been possessed by Henry II and his two sons and to annex them for ever to England without any obligation of homage or fealty on the part of the English monarch But the Dauphin and the states of France rejected this treaty so dishonourable and pernicious to the kingdom  Froissart liv chap  and Edward on the expiration of the truce having now by subsidies and frugality collected some treasure prepared himself for a new invasion of France  THE great authority and renown of the King and the prince of Wales the splendid success of their former enterprizes and the certain prospect of plunder from the defenceless provinces of France soon brought together all the military power of England and the same motives invited to Edward's standard all the hardy adventurers of the different countries of Europe  Froissart liv chap  He passed over to Calais with an army of men a force which the Dauphin could not pretend to withstand in the open field And he therefore prepared himself to elude a blow which it was impossible for him to resist He put all the considerable towns in a posture of defence ordered them to be supplied with magazines and provisions distributed proper garrisons in all places secured every thing  valuable in the fortified cities and chose his own station at Paris with a view of allowing the enemy to waste their fury on the open country  th Nov  Invasion  France  THE King aware of this plan of defence was obliged to carry along with him six thousand waggons loaded with the provisions necessary for the subsistance of his army After ravaging the province of Picardy he advanced into Champagne and having a strong desire of being crowned King of France at Rheims the usual place in which that ceremony is performed he laid siege to the city and carried on his attacks tho' without success for the space of seven weeks  Froissart liv chap Walsingham p  The place was bravely defended by the inhabitants encouraged by the exhortations of the archbishop John de Craon  till the advanced season for this expedition was entered upon in the beginning of winter obliged the King to raise the siege The province of Champagne meanwhile was laid desolate by his incursions and he thence conducted his army with a like intent into Burgundy He took and pillaged Tonnerre Gaillon Avalon and other small places but the duke of Burgundy that he might preserve his country from farther ravages consented to pay him the sum of nobles  Rymer vol p Walsingham p  Edward then bent his march towards the Nivernois which saved itself by a like composition He laid waste the Brie and the Gatinois and after a long march very destructive to France and somewhat ruinous to his own troops he appeared before the gates of Paris and taking up his quarters at BourglaReine extended his army to Longjumeau Montrouge and Vaugirard He tried to provoke the Dauphin to hazard a battle by sending him a defiance but could not make that prudent prince change his plan of operations Paris was safe from the danger of an assault by its numerous garrison from that of a blockade by its well supplied magazines and as Edward could not subsist his own army in a country wasted by foreign and domestic enemies and left also empty by the precaution of the Dauphin he was obliged to remove his quarters and he spread his army into the provinces of Maine Beausse and the Chartraine which were abandoned to the fury of their devastations  Walsingham p  The only repose which France experienced was during the festival of Easter when the King stopped the course of his ravages For superstition can sometimes restrain the rage of man which neither justice nor humanity is able to controul  WHILE the war was carried on in this ruinous manner the negotiations for peace were never interrupted But as the King still insisted on the full execution of the treaty which he had made with his prisoner at London and which was strenuously rejected by the Dauphin there appeared no likelihood of an accommodation  The earl now duke of Lancaster for this title was introduced into England during the present reign endeavoured to soften the rigor of these terms and to terminate the war on more equal and reasonable conditions He insisted with Edward that notwithstanding his great and surprizing successes the object of the war if such was to be esteemed the acquisition of the crown of France was not become any nearer than at the commencement of it or rather was set at a greater distance by those very victories and advantages which seemed to lead to it That his claim of succession had not from the first procured him one part zan in the kingdom and the continuance of these destructive hostilities had united every Frenchman in the most implacable animosity against him That tho' intestine faction had crept into the government of France it was abating every moment and no party even during the greatest heat of the contest when subjection under a foreign enemy usually appears preferable to the dominion of fellow citizens had ever adopted the pretensions of the King of England That the King of Navarre himself who alone was allied with the English instead of being a cordial friend was Edward's most dangerous rival and in the opinion of his partizans appeared to possess a much preferable title to the crown of France That the prolongation of the war however it might enrich the English soldiers was ruinous to the King himself who bore all the charges of the armament without reaping any solid or durable advantage from thence That if the present disorders of France continued that kingdom would soon be reduced to such desolation as to afford no spoils to its ravagers if it could establish a more steady government it might turn the chance of war in its favour and by its superior force and advantages be able to repel the present victors That the Dauphin even during his greatest distresses had yet conducted himself with so much prudence as to prevent the English from acquiring one foot of land in the kingdom and it were better for the King to accept by a peace what he had in vain attempted to acquire by hostilities which however hitherto successful had been extremely expensive and might prove very dangerous And that Edward having acquired so much glory by his arms the praise of moderation was the only honour which he could now aspire to an honour so much the greater that it was durable was united with that of prudence and might be attended with the most real advantages  Froissart liv chap    Peace of Bretigni  THESE reasons induced Edward to accept of more equitable terms of peace and it is probable that in order to palliate this change of resolution he ascribed it to a vow made during a terrible tempest which attacked his army on their march and which the antient historians represent as the cause of this sudden accommodation  The conferences between the English and French commissioners were carried on during a few days at Bretigni in the Chartraine and the peace was at last concluded on the following conditions  Rymer vol p Froissart liv chap    th May  It was stipulated that King John should be restored to his liberty and should pay as his ransom three millions of crowns of gold about pounds of our present money  This is a prodigious sum and probably near the half of what the King received from the parliament during the whole course of his reign It must be remarked that a tenth and fifteenth which was always thought a high grant were in the eighth year of his reign fixed at about pounds There were about sacks of wool exported every year A sack of wool was at a medium sold for five pounds Upon these suppositions it would be easy to compute all the parliamentary grants taking the list as they stand in Tyrrel vol p Tho' much must still be left to conjecture This King levied more money from his subjects than any of his predecessors and the parliament frequently complain of the poverty of the people and the oppressions under which they laboured But it is to be remarked that the half of the French King's ransom was not paid before the war broke out between the two crowns His son chose rather to employ the money in combating the English than in enriching them See Rymer vol p  which was to be discharged at different payments That Edward should for ever renounce all claim to the crown of France and to the provinces of Normandy Maine Touraine and Anjou possessed by his ancestors and should receive in exchange the provinces of Poictou Xaintonge l'Agenois Perigort the Limousin Quercy Rovergue l'Angoumois and other districts in that quarter together with Calais Guisnes Montreuil and the county of Ponthieu on the other side of France That the full sovereignty of all these provinces as well as that of Guienne should be vested in the crown of England and that France should renounce all title to feudal jurisdiction homage or appeal from them That the King of Navarre should be restored to all his honours and possessions That Edward should renounce his confederacy with the Flemish John his connexions with the Scots That the disputes concerning the succession of Brittany between the families of Blois and Mountfort should be decided by arbiters appointed by the two Kings and if the competitors refused to submit to the sentence the dispute should no longer be a ground of war between the kingdoms And that forty hostages such as should be agreed on should be sent to England as a security for the execution of all these conditions  The hostages were the two sons of the French King John and Lewis his brother Philip duke of Orleans the duke of Bourbon James de Bourbon count de Ponthieu the counts d'Eu de Longueville de St Pol de Harcourt de Vendome de Couci de Craon de Montmorenci and many of the chief nobility of France The princes were mostly released on the fulfilling of certain articles Others of the hostages and the duke of Berry among the rest were permitted to return upon their parole which they did not keep Rymer vol p    th July  IN consequence of this treaty of peace the King of France was brought over to Calais whither Edward also soon after arrived And both princes there solemnly  ratified the treaty John was sent to Boulogne the King accompanied him a mile in his journey and the two monarchs parted with many professions probably cordial and sincere of mutual friendship and amity  Froissart liv chap  The good disposition of John made him fully sensible of the generous treatment which he had met with in England and obliterated all memory of the ascendant gained over him by his rival There seldom has been a treaty of so great importance so faithfully executed by both parties Edward had scarcely from the beginning entertained any hopes of acquiring the crown of France By restoring John to his liberty and making peace at a juncture so favourable to his arms he had now plainly renounced all pretensions of this nature He had sold at a very high price that chimerical claim And had at present no other interest than to retain those acquisitions which he had made with such singular prudence and good fortune John on the other hand tho' the terms were severe and rigorous upon him possessed such fidelity and honour that he was determined at all hazards to execute them and to use every expedient for satisfying a monarch who had indeed been his greatest political enemy but had treated him personally with singular humanity and regard But notwithstanding all his endeavours there occurred many difficulties in fulfilling his purpose chiefly from the extreme reluctance which many towns and vassals in the neighbourhood of Guienne expressed against submitting to the English dominion  Froissart liv chap    and John in order to adjust these differences took a resolution of coming over himself into England His council endeavoured to dissuade him from this rash design and probably would have been pleased to see him employ more chicanery for eluding the execution of so disadvantageous a treaty But John replied to them that tho' good faith were banished from the rest of the earth she ought still to retain her habitation in the breasts of princes Some historians would detraft from the merit of this honourable behaviour by representing John as enamoured of an English lady to whom he was glad on this pretence to pay a visit But besides that this surmize is not founded on any good authority it appears very unlikely on account of the advanced age of that prince who was now in his fiftysixth year  He was lodged in the Savoy the palace where he had resided during his captivity and where he soon after sickened and died  th Ap  il  Nothing can be a stronger proof of the great dominion of fortune over men than the calamities which pursued a monarch of such eminent valour goodness and honour and wh ch he incurred merely by reason of some slight imprudences which in other situations would have been of no importance But tho' both his reign and that of his father proved extremely unfortunate to their kingdom the French crown acquired during their time very considerable accessions those of  Dauphiny and Burgundy This latter province however John had the imprudence again to dismember from the crown by bestowing it on Philip his fourth son and chief favourite  Rymer vol p  a deed which was afterwards the source of many calamities to his kingdom  JOHN was succeeded in the throne by Charles the Dauphin a prince educated in the school of adversity and well qualified by his consummate prudence and experience to repair all the losses which the kingdom had suffered from the errors of his two predecessors Contrary to the practice of all the great princes of those times which held nothing in estimation but military courage he seems to have fixed it as a maxim never to appear at the head of his armies and he was the first King in Europe who showed the advantages of policy foresight and judgment above a rash and precipitate valour The events of his reign compared with those of the preceding are a proof how little reason kingdoms have to value themselves on their victories or to be humbled by their defeats which in reality ought to be ascribed entirely to the good or bad conduct of their rulers and go a very little way towards determining national characters and manners  State of France  BEFORE Charles could think of counterballancing so great a power as England it was necessary for him to remedy the many disorders to which his own kingdom was exposed He turned his arms against the King of Navarre the great disturber of France during that age He defeated that prince by the conduct of Bertrand du Guesclin a gentleman of Brittany one of the most accomplished characters of the age whom he had the discernment to choose as the instrument of all his victories  Froissart liv chap  And he obliged his enemy to accept of moderate terms of peace Du Guesclin was less fortunate in the wars of Brittany which still continued notwithstanding the mediation of France and England He was defeated and taken prisoner at Auray by Chandos Charles de Blois was there slain and the young count de Mountfort soon after got entire possession of that dutchy  Froissart liv chap c Walsing p  But the prudence of Charles broke the force of this blow He submitted to the decision of fortune He acknowledged the title of Mountfort tho' a zealous partizan of England and received the profered homage for his dominions But the chief obstacle which the French King met with in the settlement of the state proceeded from obscure enemies whom their crimes alone rendered eminent and their number dangerous  ON the conclusion of the treaty of Bretigni the many military adventurers who had followed the fortunes of Edward being dispersed into the several provinces  and possessed of strong holds refused to lay down their arms or relinquish a course of life to which they were now accustomed and by which alone they could gain a subsistance  Froissart liv chap  They associated themselves with the banditti who were already enured to the habits of rapine and violence and under the name of the  companies  and  companions  became a terror to all the peaceable inhabitants Some English and Gascon gentlemen of character particularly sir Matthew Gournay sir Hugh Calverley the chevalier Verte and others were not ashamed to take the command of these ruffians whose numbers amounted on the whole to near and who bore the appearance of regular armies rather than bands of robbers These leaders fought pitched battles with the troops of France and gained victories in one of which Jaques de Bourbon a prince of the blood was slain  Froissart liv chap  And they proceeded to such a height that they wanted little but regular establishments to become princes and thereby sanctify by the maxims of the world their infamous profession The greater spoil they committed on the country the more easy they found it to recruit their number All those who were reduced to misery and despair flocked to their standard The evil was every day encreasing And tho' the Pope declared them excommunicate these military plunderers however deeply affected with this sentence to which they paid a much greater regard than to any maxims of justice or humanity could not be induced by it to betake themselves to any peaceable or lawful profession  AS Charles was not able by power to redress so enormous a grievance he was led both by necessity and by the turn of his character to correct it by policy and to contrive some method of discharging into foreign countries this dangerous and intestine evil  PETER King of Castile stigmatized by his contemporaries and by posterity with the epithet of  Cruel  had filled with blood and murder his kingdom and his own family and having incurred the universal hatred of his subjects he kept only from present terror an anxious and precarious possession of the throne His nobles fell every day the victims of his severity He put to death several of his natural brothers from groundless jealousy Each murder by multiplying his enemies became the occasion of fresh barbarities And as he was not destitute of talents his neighbours no less than his own subjects were alarmed by the progress of his violence and injustice The ferocity of his temper instead of being softened by his strong propensity to love was rather enflamed by that passion and took thence new occasion to exert itself Instigated by Mary de Padilla who had acquired the ascendant over him he threw into prison Blanche de Bourbon  his wife sister to the Queen of France and soon after made way by poison for the espousing of his mistress  HENRY count de Transtamare his natural brother seeing the fate of every one who had become obnoxious to this tyrant took arms against him but being foiled in the attempt he sought for refuge in France where he found the minds of every one extremely enflamed against Peter on account of his murder of the French princess He proposed to Charles the enlisting of the  companies  into his service and leading them into Castile where from the concurrence of his own friends and the enemies of his brother he had the prospect of certain and immediate success The French King charmed with the project employed Du Guesclin in negotiating with the leaders of these banditti The treaty was soon concluded The high character of honour which that general possessed made every one trust to his promises Tho' the intended expedition was kept a secret the companies implicitly inlisted under his standard And they required no other condition before their engagement than an assurance that they were not to be led against the prince of Wales in Guienne But that prince was so little averse to the enterprize that he allowed some gentlemen of his retinue to enter into the service under du Guesclin  DU GUESCLIN having compleated his levies led the army first to Avignon where the Pope then resided and demanded sword in hand an absolution for his soldiers and the sum of livres The first was very readily promised him some more difficulty was made with regard to the second  "I believe my fellows"  replied du Guesclin  "may make a shift to do without your absolution but the money is absolutely necessary"  The Pope then extorted from the inhabitants in the city and neighbourhood the sum of an hundred thousand livres and offered it to Du Guesclin  "It is not my purpose"  cried that generous warrior  "to oppress the innocent people The Pope and his cardinals themselves can easily spare me that sum from their own pockets This money I insist must be restored to the owners And should they be defrauded of it I shall myself return from the other side of the Pyrenees and oblige you to make them restitution"  The Pope found the necessity of submission and paid him from his own treasury the sum demanded  Hist de Du Guesclin  The army hallowed by the blessings and enriched by the spoils of the church proceeded on their expedition  THESE experienced and hardy soldiers conducted by so able a general easily prevailed over the King of Castile whose subjects instead of supporting their oppressor were ready to join the enemy against him  Froissart liv chap  Peter fled from his dominions took shelter in Guienne and craved the protection of the prince of  Wales whom his father had invested with the sovereignty of these conquered provinces under the title of the principality of Aquitaine  Rymer vol p  Froissart liv chap  The prince seemed now to have entirely changed his sentiments with regard to the Spanish transactions Whether that he was moved by the generosity of supporting a distrest prince and thought as is but too usual among sovereigns that the rights of the people were a matter of much less consideration or dreaded the acquisition of so powerful a confederate to France as the new King of Castile or what is most probable was impatient of rest and ease and sought only an opportunity of exerting his military talents by which he had already acquired so much renown  Expedition into Cast  le  He promised his assistance to the dethroned monarch and having obtained the consent of his father he levied a great army and set out upon his enterprize He was accompanied by his younger brother John of Gaunt created duke of Lancaster in the place of the good prince of that name who had died without any male issue and whose daughter he had espoused Chandos also who bore among the English the same character which Du Guesclin had acquired among the French commanded under him in this expedition  THE first blow which the prince of Wales gave to Henry de Transtamare was the recalling all the  companies  from his service and so much reverence did they bear to the name of Edward that great numbers of them immediately withdrew from Spain and inlisted under his standard Henry however beloved by his new subjects and supported by the King of Arragon and others of his neighbours was able to meet the enemy with an army of men forces three times more numerous than those commanded by Edward Du Guesclin and all his experienced officers advised him to delay any decisive action to cut off the prince of Wales's provisions and to avoid every engagement with a general whose enterprizes had hitherto been always conducted with prudence and crowned with success  April  Henry trusted too much to his numbers and ventured to encounter the English prince at Najara  Froissart liv chap  Historians of that age are commonly very copious in describing the shock of armies in battle the valour of the combatants the slaughter and various successes of the day But tho' small rencounters in those times were often well disputed the military discipline was always too imperfect to preserve order in great armies and such actions deserve more the name of routs than of battles Henry was chaced off the field with the loss of above men There perished only four knights and forty private men on the side of the English  PETER who so well merited the infamous epithet which he bore proposed to murder all his prisoners in cold blood but was restrained from this barbarity by the remonstrances of the prince of Wales All Castile now submitted to the  victor Peter was restored to the throne And Edward finished this perilous enterprize with his usual glory But he had soon reason to repent the associating himself with a man like Peter abandoned to all sense of virtue and honour The ungrateful tyrant refused the stipulated pay to the English forces and Edward finding his soldiers daily perish by sickness and even his own health impaired by the climate was obliged without receiving any satisfaction on this head to return into Guienne  Froissart liv chap Walsingham p    THE monstrous cruelties exercised by Peter over his helpless subjects whom he now regarded as vanquished rebels revived all the animosity of the Castilians against him and on the return of Henry de Transtamare together with Du Guesclin and some forces levied anew in France the tyrant was again dethroned and was taken prisoner His brother in resentment of his cruelties murdered him with his own hand and was placed on the throne of Castile which he transmitted to his posterity The duke of Lancaster who espoused in second marriage the eldest daughter of Peter inherited only the empty title of that sovereignty and encreased the animosity of the new King of Castile against England  Rupture with France  BUT the prejudice which the affairs of prince Edward received from this splendid tho' imprudent expedition ended not with it He had involved himself inso much debt by his preparations and the pay of his troops that he found it necessary on his return to impose on his principality a new tax which some of the nobility submitted to with extreme reluctance and to which others absolutely refused compliance  This tax was a livre upon a hearth and it was imagined that this imposition would have yielded livres a year which supposes so many hearths in the province possessed by the English But such loose conjectures have no manner of authority much less in such ignorant times There was a strong instance of it in the present reign The house of commons granted the King a tax of twenty two shillings on each parish supposing that the amount of the whole would be pounds But they were found to be in a mistake of near six to one Cotton p And the privy council assumed the power of augmenting the tax so as to make it answer the sums proposed to be levied by it which was certainly a very irregular practice  This incident revived the animosity which the inhabitants bore to the English and which all the amiable qualities of the prince of Wales were not able to mitigate or assuage They complained that they were considered as a conquered people that their privileges were disregarded that all trust was given to the English alone that every office of honour and profit was conferred on these foreigners and that the extreme reluctance which most of them had expressed to receive this new yoke was likely to be long remembered against them They cast therefore their eyes towards their antient sovereign  whose prudence they found had now brought the affairs of his kingdom into excellent order and the counts of Armagnac Comminge and Perigord the lord d'Albert with other nobles went to Paris and were encouraged to carry their complaints to Charles as to their lord Paramount against these oppressions of the English government  Froissart liv chap    IN the treaty of Bretigni it had been agreed that the two Kings should make renounciations Edward of his claim to the crown of France and to the provinces of Normandy Maine and Anjou John of the homage and fealty due for Guienne and the other provinces ceded to the English But when that treaty was confirmed and renewed at Calais it was found necessary on account of some formalities peculiar to the feudal law that the mutual renounciations should for some time be deferred and it was agreed that the parties meanwhile should make no use of these claims against each other  Rymer vol p  Tho' the failure in exchanging these renounciations had still proceeded from France  Rot Franc Edw III m from Tyrrel vol p  Edward appears to have taken no umbrage at it both because this clause seemed to give him entire security and because some reasonable apology had probably been made to him for each delay It was however on this pretence gross and iniquitous as it was that Charles resolved to ground his claim of considering himself still as superior lord of these provinces and of receiving the appeals of his subvassals  Froissart liv chap    BUT as the views of policy more than those of justice enter into the deliberations of princes and as the mortal injuries received from English the pride of their triumphs the severe terms imposed by the treaty of Peace seemed to render every prudent means of revenge honourable against them Charles was determined to take this measure less by the reasonings of his civilians and lawyers than by the present situation of the two monarchies He considered the declining years of Edward the languishing state of the prince of Wales's health the affection which the inhabitants of all these provinces bore to their antient master their distance from England their contiguity to France the extreme animosity expressed by his own subjects against these invaders and their ardent thirst of vengeance and having made silently all the preparations requisite he sent to the prince of Wales a summons to appear in his court at Paris and there to justify his conduct towards his vassals The prince replied that he would come to Paris but it should be at the head of sixty thousand men  Froissart liv chap  The unwarlike character of Charles kept Edward even yet from thinking that that monarch was in earnest in this bold and hazardous attempt  IT soon appeared what a poor return the King received from his distant conquests for all the blood and treasure expended in the quarrel and how impossible it was to retain acquisitions in an age when no regular force could be maintained sufficient to defend them against the revolt of the inhabitants much less if that danger was conjoined with the invasion of a foreign enemy Charles fell first upon Ponthieu which gave the English an inlet into the heart of France The citizens of Abbeville opened their gates to him  Walsingham p    Ill success of the English  Those of St Valori Rue and Crotoy imitated the example and the whole country was in a little time reduced to submission The dukes of Berri and Anjou brothers to Charles being assisted by Du Guesclin who was recalled from Spain invaded the southern provinces and by means of their good conduct the favourable inclinations of the people and the ardor of the French nobility made every day considerable progress against the English The state of the prince of Wales's health did not permit him to mount on horseback or exert his usual activity Chandos the constable of Guienne was slain in one action  Froissart liv chap Walsingham p  The Captal de Buche who succeeded him in that office was taken prisoner in another  Froissart liv chap  And when young Edward himself was obliged by his increasing infirmities to throw up the command and return to his native country the English affairs in the south of France seemed to be menaced with a total ruin  EDWARD incensed at these injuries threatned to put to death all the French hostages who remained in his hands but on reflection abstained from that ungenerous revenge After resuming by advice of parliament the vain title of King of France  Rymer vol p Cotton's Abridg p  he endeavoured to send succours into Gascony but all his attempts both by sea and land proved unsuccessful The earl of Pembroke was intercepted at sea and taken prisoner with his whole army near Rochelle by a fleet which Henry King of Castile had fitted out for that purpose  Froissart liv chap Walsingham p  Edward himself embarked for Bourdeaux with another army but was so long detained by contrary winds that he was obliged to lay aside the enterprize  Froissart liv cap Walsingham p  Sir Robert Knolles at the head of men marched out of Calais and continued his ravages to the gates of Paris without being able to provoke the enemy to an engagement He proceeded on his march to the provinces of Maine and Anjou which he laid waste but part of his army being there defeated by the conduct of Du Guesclin who was now created constable of France and who seems to have been the first consummate general that had yet appeared in Europe the rest  were scattered and dispersed and the small remains of it instead of reaching Guienne took shelter in Brittany whose sovereign had embraced the alliance of England  Froissart liv chap Walsingham p  The duke of Lancaster some time after made a like attempt with an army of men and marched the whole length of France from Calais to Bourdeaux but was so much harassed by the flying parties which attended him that he brought not the half of his army to the place of their destination Edward from the necessity of his affairs was at last obliged to conclude a truce with the enemy  Froissart liv chap Walsingham p  after almost all his antient possessions in France had been ravished from him except Bourdeaux and Bayonne and all his conquests except Calais  THE decline of the King's life was exposed to many mortifications and corresponded not to the splendid and noisy scenes which had filled the beginning and the middle of it Besides seeing the loss of his foreign dominions and being baffled in every attempt to defend them he felt the decay of his authority at home and experienced from the sharpness of some parliamentary remonstrances the great inconstancy of the people and the influence of present fortune over all their judgments  Walsingham p Ypod Neust  This prince who during the vigor of his age had been chiefly occupied in the pursuits of war and ambition began at an unseasonable period to indulge himself in pleasure and being now a widower he attached himself to a lady of sense and spirit one Alice Pierce who acquired a great ascendant over him and by her influence gave so much disgust to his people that in order to satisfy the parliament he was obliged to remove her from court  Walsingham p  The indolence also naturally attending old age and infirmities had made him in a great measure resign the administration into the hands of his son the duke of Lancaster who as he was far from being popular weakened extremely the affection born by the English to the person and government of the King Men carried their jealousies very far against the duke and as they saw with infinite regret the death of the prince of Wales every day approaching they apprehended left the succession of his son Richard now a minor should be defeated by the intrigues of Lancaster and by the weak indulgence of the old King But Edward in order to satisfy both the people and the prince on this head declared in parliament his grandson heir and successor to the crown and thereby cut off all the hopes of the duke of Lancaster if he ever had the temerity to entertain any  th June Death of the prince of Wales  THE prince of Wales after a lingering illness died in the fortysixth year of his age and left a character illustrated by every eminent virtue and from  his earliest youth till the hour he expired unstained by any blemish His valor and military talents formed the smallest part of his merit His generosity humanity affability moderation gained him the affections of all the world and he was qualified to throw a lustre not only on that rude age in which he lived and which nowise infected him with its vices but on the most shining period of antient or modern history  st June  The King survived about a year this melancholy incident  Death  England was deprived at once of both of these princes its chief ornament and support He expired in the sixtyfifth year of his age and the fiftyfirst of his reign and the people were sensible tho' too late of the irreparable loss which they had sustained  and character of the King  THE English are apt to consider with peculiar fondness the history of Edward III and to esteem his reign as it was one of the longest the most glorious also which occurs in the annals of their nation The ascendant which they then began to acquire over France their rival and national enemy makes them cast their eyes on this period with great complacency and sanctifies every measure which Edward embraced for that end But the domestic government of this prince is really more admirable than his foreign victories and England enjoyed by the prudence and vigor of his administration a longer interval of domestic peace and tranquillity than she had been blest with in any former period or than she experienced for many ages after He gained the affections of the great yet curbed their licentiousness He made them feel his power without their daring or even being inclined to murmur at it His affable and obliging behaviour his munificence and generosity made them submit with pleasure to his dominion his valor and conduct made them successful in most of their enterprizes and their unquiet spirits directed against a public enemy had no leisure to breed those disturbances to which they were naturally so much inclined and which the frame of the government seemed so much to authorize This was the chief benefit which resulted from Edward's victories and conquests His foreign wars were in other respects neither founded in justice nor directed to any very salutary purpose His attempt against the King of Scotland a minor and a brotherinlaw and the revival of his grandfather's claim of superiority over that kingdom were both unreasonable and ungenerous and he allowed himself to be too soon seduced by the glaring prospect of French conquests from the acquisition of a point which was practicable and which might really if attained have been of lasting utility to his country and his successors The success which he met with in France tho' chiefly owing to his eminent talents was unexpected and yet from the very nature of things not from any unforeseen accident was found even during his own lifetime to have procured him no solid advantages  But the glory of a Conqueror is so dazling to the vulgar the animosity of nations is so extreme that the fruitless desolation of so fine a part of Europe as France is totally disregarded by us and is never considered as a blemish in the character or conduct of this prince And indeed from the unfortunate state of human nature it will commonly happen that a sovereign of great genius such as Edward who usually finds every thing easy in his domestic government will turn himself towards military enterprizes where alone he meets with opposition and where he has full exercise for his industry and capacity  EDWARD had a numerous posterity by his Queen Philippa of Hainault His eldest son was the heroic Edward commonly called the Black Prince from the colour of his armour This prince espoused his cousin Joan commonly called the  fair maid of Kent  daughter and heir of his uncle the earl of Kent who was beheaded in the beginning of this reign She was first married to Sir Thomas Holland by whom she had children She had a son Richard by the prince of Wales who alone survived his father  THE second son of King Edward for we pass by such as died in their childhood was Lionel duke of Clarence who was first married to Elizabeth de Burgh daughter and heir of the earl of Ulster by whom he left only one daughter married to Edmund Mortimer earl of Marche Lionel espoused in second marriage Violante the daughter of the duke of Milan  Rymer vol p  and died in Italy soon after the consummation of his nuptials without leaving any posterity by that princess Of all the family he resembled most his father and eldest brother in his noble qualities  EDWARD's third son was John of Gaunt so called from the place of his birth He was created duke of Lancaster and from him sprung that branch which afterwards possessed the crown The fourth son of this royal family was Edmund created earl of Cambridge by his father and duke of York by his nephew The fifth son was Thomas who received the title of earl of Buckingham from his father and that of duke of Glocester from his nephew In order to prevent confusion we shall always distinguish these two princes by the titles of York and Glocester even before they were advanced to them  THERE were also several princesses born to Edward by Philippa  viz  Isabella Joan Mary and Margaret who espoused in the order of their names Ingelram de Coucy earl of Bedford Alphonso King of Castile John de Mountfort duke of Brittany and John Hastings earl of Pembroke The princess Joan died at Bourdeaux before the consummation of her marriage  IT is remarked by an elegant historian  Dr Robertson's history of Scotland book  that Conquerors tho' usually the bane of human kind proved often in those feudal times the most indulgent of  sovereigns They stood most in need of supplies from their people and not being able to compel them by force to submit to the necessary impositions they were obliged to make them some compensation by equitable laws and popular concessions This remark is in some measure tho' imperfectly justified by the conduct of Edward III He took no steps of moment without consulting his parliament and obtaining their approbation which he afterwards pleaded as a reason for their supporting his measures  Cotton's Abridg p  The parliament therefore rose into greater consideration during his reign and acquired a more regular authority than in any former times and even the house of commons which during turbulent and factious periods was naturally oppressed by the greater power of the crown and barons began to appear of some weight in the constitution In the latter years of Edward the King's ministers were impeached in parliament particularly lord Latimer who fell a sacrifice to their authority  Cotton's Abridg p  and they even obliged him to banish his mistress by their remonstrances Some attention was also paid to the elections of their members and lawyers in particular who were at that time men of very inferior character were totally excluded the house during several parliaments  Cotton's Abridg p    ONE of the most popular laws enacted by any prince was the statute which passed in the twentyfifth of this reign  Chap  and which limited the cases of high treason before vague and uncertain to three principal heads the conspiring the death of the King the levying war against him and the adhering to his enemies and the judges were prohibited if any other cases should occur from inflicting the penalty of treason without an application to parliament The bounds of treason were indeed so much limited by this statute which still remains in force without any alteration that the lawyers were obliged to enlarge them and to explain a conspiracy for levying war against the King to be equivalent to a conspiracy against his life and this interpretation seemingly forced has from the necessity of the case been tacitly acquiesced in It was also ordained that a parliament should be held once a year or oftner if need be A law which like many others was never observed and lost its authority by disuse  Edw III cap    EDWARD granted above twenty parliamentary confirmations of the great charter and these concessions are commonly appealed to as proofs of his great indulgence to the people and his tender regard to their liberties But the contrary presumption is much more natural If the maxims of Edward's reign had not been in general somewhat arbitrary and if the great charter had not been frequently violated the parliament would never have applied for these frequent  confirmations which could add no force to a deed regularly observed and which could serve to no other purpose than to prevent the contrary precedents from turning into a rule and acquiring authority It was indeed the effect of the irregular government during those ages that a statute which had been enacted some years instead of acquiring was imagined to lose force by time and needed to be often renewed by recent statutes of the same sense and tenor Hence likewise that general clause so frequent in old acts of parliament that the statutes enacted by the King's progenitors shall be observed  Edw III cap Edw III cap c  a precaution which if we do not consider the circumstances might appear absurd and ridiculous The frequent confirmations in general terms of the church's privileges proceeded from the same cause  IT is a clause in one of Edward's statutes  that no man of what estate or condit on soever shall be put out of land or tenement nor taken nor imprisoned nor disherited nor put to death without being brought in answer by due process of the law  Edw III cap  This privilege was sufficiently secured by a clause of the great charter which had received a general confirmation in the first chapter of the same statute Why then is this clause so anxiously and as we may think so superfluously repeated Plainly because there had been some late infringements of it which gave umbrage to the commons  They plainly assert in the th of this reign that there had been such instances Cotton's Abridg p They repeat the same in the st Year See p    BUT there is no article in which the laws are more frequently repeated during this reign almost in the same terms than that of purveyance which the parliament always calls an  outrageous  and  intolerable  grievance and the source of  infinite  damage to the people  Edw III c  The parliament tried to abolish this prerogative altogether by prohibiting any one to take goods without the consent of the owners  Edw III cap  and by changing the heinous name of  purveyors  as they call it into that of buyers  Edw III cap  But the arbitrary conduct of Edward still brought back the grievance upon them tho' contrary both to the Great Charter and to many statutes This disorder was in a good measure derived from the state of the public finances and of the kingdom and could therefore the less admit of any remedy The prince frequently wanted ready money yet his family must be provided for And he was obliged to employ force and violence for that purpose and to give tallies at what rate he pleased to the owners of the goods which he laid hold of The kingdom also abounded so little in commodities that had the owners been strictly protected by law they could easily have exacted  any price from the King especially in his frequent progresses when he came to distant and poor places where the court did not usually reside and where a regular plan for supplying it could not easily be established  THE magnificent castle of Windsor was built by Edward III and his method of conducting that work may serve as a specimen of the condition of the people in that age Instead of alluring workmen by contracts and wages he assessed every county in England to send him so many masons tilers and carpenters as if he had been levying an army  Ashmole's hist of the garter p    THEY mistake indeed very much the genius of this reign who imagine that it was not very arbitrary All the high prerogatives of the crown were to the full exerted in it but what was some consolation and promised in time some relief to the people they were always complained of by the commons Such as the dispensing power  Cotton's Abridg p  the

the army  Tyrrel's Hist vol p from the records    BUT there was no act of arbitrary power more frequently repeated in this reign than that of the imposition of taxes without consent of parliament Tho' that assembly granted the King more supplies than ever had been obtained by any of his predecessors his great undertakings and the necessity of his affairs obliged him still to levy more and after his great success against France had added weight to his authority these impositions became almost annual and perpetual Cotton's Abridgement of the records affords numerous instances of this kind in the first  Rymer vol p  year of his reign in the thirteenth year  P  in the fourteenth  P  in the the twentieth  P  in the twentyfirst  P  in the twentysecond  P  in the twentyfifth  P  in the thirtyeighth  P  in the fiftieth  P  and in the fiftyfirst  P    THE King openly avowed and maintained this power of levying taxes at pleasure At one time he replied to the remonstrance of the commons that the impositions had been exacted from great necessity and had been assented to by the prelates counts barons and  some  of the commons  Cotton p He repeats the same answer in p Some of the commons were such as he was pleased to consult with  at another that he would advise with his council  Cotton p  When the parliament desired that a law might be enacted for the punishment of such as levied these arbitrary impositions he refused compliance  Cotton p  In the subsequent year they desired that the King might renounce this pretended prerogative but his answer was that he would levy no taxes without necessity for the defence of the realm and where he reasonably might use that authority  Cotton p  This incident passed a very few days before his death and these were in a manner his last words to his people It would seem that the famous charter or statute of Edward I  de tallagio non concedendo  tho' never repealed was supposed to have already lost by age all its authority  THESE facts can only show the  practice  of the times For as to the  right  the continual remonstrances of the commons may seem to prove that it rather was on their side At least these remonstrances served to prevent the arbitrary practices of the court from becoming an established part of the constitution In so much a better condition were the privileges of the people even during the arbitrary reign of Edward III than during some subsequent ones particularly those of the Tudors where no tyranny or abuse of power ever met with any check or opposition or so much as a remonstrance from parliament  IT is easy to imagine that a prince of so much sense and spirit as Edward would be no slave to the court of Rome Tho' the old tribute was paid during some years of his minority  Rymer vol p  he afterwards withheld it and when the Pope in threatened to cite him to the court of Rome for default of payment he laid the matter before his parliament That assembly unanimously declared that King John could not without a national consent subject his kingdom to a foreign power And they were therefore determined to support their sovereign against this exorbitant pretension  Cotton Abridg p    DURING this reign the statute of provisors was enacted rendering it penal to procure any presentations to benefices from the court of Rome and securing the rights of all patrons and electors which had been extremely encroached on by the Pope  Edw III Edw III  By a subsequent statute every person was outlawed who carried any cause or appeal to the court of Rome  Edw III Edw III    THE laity at this time seem to have been extremely prejudiced against the papal power and even somewhat against their own clergy because of their connexions with the Roman pontiff They pretended that the usurpations of the Pope were the cause of all the plagues injuries famine and poverty of the realm was more destructive to it than all the wars and was the cause why it contained not a third of the inhabitants and commodities which it formerly possessed That the taxes levied by him exceeded five times those paid to the King That every thing was venal in that sinful city of Rome and that even the patrons in England had thence learned to practice simony without remorse or scruple  Cotton p  At another time they petition the King to employ no churchman in any office of state  Cotton p  and they even speak in plain terms of expelling by force the papal authority and thereby providing a remedy against oppressions which they neither could nor would any longer endure  Cotton p  Men who talked in this style were not far from the reformation But Edward did not think proper to second all this zeal Tho' he passed the statute of provisors he took little care of its execution and the parliament made continual complaints of his negligence on this head  Cotton p  He was content with having reduced such of the Romish ecclesiastics as possessed revenues in England to depend entirely upon him by means of that statute  As to the police of the kingdom during this period it was certainly better than during times of faction civil wars and disorder to which England was so often exposed Yet were there several vices in the constitution the bad consequences of which all the power and vigilance of the King could not prevent The barons by their confederacies with those of their own order and by supporting and defending their retainers in every iniquity  Edw III chap Edw III chap Edw III chap  were the chief abettors of robbers murderers and ruffians of all kinds and no law could be executed against these criminals The nobility were brought to give their promise in parliament that they would not avow retain or support any felon or breaker of the law  Cotton p  yet this engagement which we may wonder to see exacted from men of their rank was never regarded by them The commons make continual complaints of the multitude of robberies murders ravishment of women and other disorders which they say were become numberless in every part of the kingdom and which they always ascribe to the protection which the criminals received from the great  Cotton p  The King of Cyprus who paid a visit to England during this reign was robbed and stript on the highway with his whole retinue  Walsing p    Edward himself contributed to this dissolution of law by his facility in granting pardons to felons from the sollicitation of his courtiers Laws were made to retrench this prerogative  Edw III cap Edw III cap  and remonstrances of the commons were presented against the abuse of it  Cotton p  But to no purpose The gratifying a nobleman of power and interest continued still to be of more importance than the protection of the people The King also granted many franchises which interrupted the course of justice and the execution of the laws  Cotton p    COMMERCE and industry were certainly at a very low ebb during this period The bad police of the country alone affords a sufficient reason The only exports were wool skins hydes leather butter tin lead and such unmanufactured goods of which wool was by far the most considerable Knyghton has asserted that sacks of wool were annually exported and sold at twenty pounds a sack money of that age But he is widely mistaken both in the quantity exported and the value In the parliamennt remonstrate that the King by an illegal imposition of forty shillings on each sack exported had levied pounds a year  Cotton p  Which reduces the annual exports to sacks A sack contained twenty six stone and each stone fourteen pounds  Edw III cap  and at a medium was not valued at above five pounds a sack  Cotton p  that is fourteen or fifteen pounds of our present money Knyghton's computation raises it to sixty pounds which is near four times the present price of wool in England According to this reduced computation the export of wool returned about pounds of our present money instead of six millions which is an extravagant sum  EDWARD endeavoured to introduce and promote the woollen manufacture by giving protection and encouragement to foreign weavers  Edw III cap Rymer vol p Murimuth p  and by enacting a law prohibiting every one to wear any cloth but of English make  Edw III cap  The parliament prohibited the exportation of woollen goods which was not so well judged especially while the exportation of unwrought wool was so much allowed and encouraged A like injudicious law was made against the exportation of manufactured iron  Edw cap    IN the first of Richard II the parliament complains extremely of the decay of shipping during the preceding reign and assert that one sea port formerly contained more vessels than were then to be found in the whole kingdom This calamity  they ascribe to the arbitrary seizure of ships by Edward for the service of his frequent expeditions  Cotton p    THE parliament attempted the impracticable scheme of reducing the price of labour after the pestilence and also that of poultry  Edw III cap  A reaper in the first week of August was not allowed to take above two pence a day or near sixpence of our present money in the second week a third more A master carpenter was limited thro' the whole year to three pence a day a common carpenter to two pence money of that age  Edw III cap  It is remarkable that in the same reign the pay of a common soldier an archer was six pence a day which by the change both in denomination and value would be equivalent to four or five shillings of our present money  Dugdale's baronage vol p Brady's hist vol App N  o  The pay of a man at arms was quadruple We may therefore conclude that the numerous armies mentioned by historians in those times consisted chiefly of ragamuffins who followed the camp and lived by plunder Edward's army before Calais consisted of men yet its pay for sixteen months was only pounds Brady ibid  Soldiers were then inlisted only for a very short time They lived idle all the rest of the year and commonly all the rest of their lives One successful campaign by pay and plunder and the ransom of prisoners was supposed to be a small fortune to a man which was a great allurement to enter into the service  THE staple of wool woolfells leather and lead was fixed by act of parliament in particular towns of England  Edw III  Afterwards it was removed by law to Calais But Edward who commonly deemed his prerogative superior to law paid little regard to these statutes and when the parliament remonstrated with him on account of such acts of power he told them plainly that he would proceed in that matter as he thought proper  Cotton p  It is not easy to perceive any advantages which arose from this great anxiety of fixing a staple unless perhaps it invited foreigners to a market when they knew beforehand that they would meet there with great choice of any particular species of commodity This policy of inviting foreigners to Calais was carried so far that all English merchants were prohibited by law from exporting any English goods from the staple which was in a manner the total abandoning all navigation except that to Calais  Edw III cap  A contrivance seemingly very absurd and extraordinary  LUXURY was complained of in that age as well as in others of more refinement and attempts were made by parliament to restrain it particularly on the head of apparel where surely it is the most obviously innocent and inoffensive No man under an hundred a year was allowed to wear gold silver or silk in his cloaths Servants also were prohibited from eating flesh meat or fish above once  a day  Edw III cap c  It was easy to foresee that such ridiculous laws must prove ineffectual and could never be executed  THE use of the French language in pleadings and public deeds was abolished  Edward III cap  It may appear strange that the nation should so long have worn this badge of conquest But the King and nobility seem never to have become thoroughly English till Edward's wars with France gave them an antipathy to that nation Yet still it was long before the use of the English tongue came into fashion The first English paper which we meet with in Rymer is in the year during the reign of Richard II  Rymer vol p  This paper by the stile seems to have been drawn by the Scots and was signed only by the wardens of the marches  There are Spanish papers in that collection more antient  Rymer vol  p    And the use of the Latin and French still continued  IN the commons petitioned that in consideration of the preceding pestilence such persons as possessed manors holding of the King in chief and had let liferent leases without obtaining licences might continue to exercise the same power till the country was become more populous  Cotton p    The commons were sensible that this security of possession was a good means for rendering the kingdom prosperous and flourishing yet durst not apply all at once for a greater relaxation of their chains  THERE is not a reign among those of the antient English monarchs which deserves more to be studied than that of Edward III nor one where the domestic transactions will better discover the true genius of that kind of mixed government which was then established in England The struggles with regard to the validity and authority of the great charter were now over The King was acknowledged to lie under some limitations Edward himself was a prince of great capacity not governed by favourites not led astray by any unruly passion sensible that nothing could be more essential to his interests than to keep on good terms with his people Yet on the whole it appears that the government at best was only a barbarous monarchy not regulated by any fixed maxims nor bounded by any certain undisputed rights which were in practice regularly observed The King conducted himself by one set of principles the barons by another the commons by a third the clergy by a fourth All these systems of government were contrary and incompatible Each of them prevailed according as incidents were favourable to it A great prince rendered the monarchical power predominant The weakness of a King gave reins to the aristocracy A superstitious age saw the clergy triumphant The people for whom alone government was instituted and who alone deserve consideration were commonly the weakest of the  whole But the commons little obnoxious to any other order tho' they sunk under the violence of tempests silently reared their head in more peaceable times and while the storm was brewing were courted by all sides and thus received still some accession to their privileges or at worst some confirmation of them  CHAP XVII RICHARD II  Government during the minorityInsurrection of the common peopleDiscontent of the

insurrectionDeposition of the KingHis murderHis characterMiscellaneous transactions during this reign  Government durin  the minority  THE parliament which was summoned soon after the King's accession was both elected and assembled in tranquility and the great change from a sovereign of consummate wisdom and experience to a boy of eleven years of age was not immediately perceived by the people The habits of order and obedience which the barons had been taught during the long reign of Edward still influenced them and the authority of the King's three uncles the dukes of Lancaster York and Glocester sufficed to repress for a time the turbulent spirit to which that order in a weak reign was so often subject The dangerous ambition too of these princes themselves was checked by the plain and undeniable title of Richard by the declaration of it made by his grandfather in parliament and by the affectionate regard which the people bore to the memory of his father and which was naturally transferred to the young prince upon the throne The different characters of these three dukes rendered them also a counterpoize to each other and it was natural to expect that any dangerous designs which might be formed by one brother would meet with opposition from the others Lancaster whose age and experience and authority under the late King gave him the ascendant among them tho' his integrity seemed not proof against great  temptations was neither of an enterprizing spirit nor of a popular and engaging temper York was indolent unactive and of a slender capacity Glocester was turbulent bold and popular but being the youngest of the family was restrained by the power and authority of his elder brothers There appeared therefore no circumstance in the domestic situation of England which might endanger the public peace or give any immediate apprehensions to the lovers of their country  BUT as Edward tho' he had fixed the succession to the crown had taken no care to establish a plan of government during the minority of his grandson it behoved the parliament to supply this defect And the house of commons distinguished themselves by taking the lead on that occasion This house which had been rising to consideration during the whole course of the late reign naturally received an accession of power during the minority and as it was now becoming a scene of bufiness the commons chose for the first time a speaker who might preserve order in their debates and maintain those forms which are requisite in all numerous assemblies Peter de la Mare was the man pitched on the same person who had been imprisoned and detained in custody by the late King for his freedom of speech in attacking the mistress and the ministers of that prince But tho' this election discovered a spirit of liberty in the commons and was followed by farther attacks both on these ministers and on Alice Pierce  Walsing p  they were still too much sensible of their great inferiority to assume at first any immediate share in the administration of government or the care of the King's person They were contented to apply by petition to the lords for that purpose and desire them both to appoint a council of nine who might direct the public business and to choose men of a virtuous life and conversation who might inspect the conduct and education of the young prince The lords complied with the first part of this request and elected the bishops of London Carlisle and Salisbury the earls of Marche and Stafford sir Richard de Stafford sir Henry le Scrope sir John Devereux and sir Hugh Segrave to whom they gave authority for a year to conduct the ordinary course of business  Rymer vol p  But as to the regulation of the King's household they declined interposing in an office which they said was both so invidious in itself and might prove so disagreeable to his majesty  THE commons as they acquired more courage ventured to proceed a step further in their applications They presented a petition in which they prayed the King to check the prevailing custom among the barons of forming illegal confederacies  together and supporting each other as well as men of inferior rank in the violations of law and justice They received from the throne a general and an obliging answer to this petition But another part of their application that all the great officers should during the King's minority be appointed by parliament which seemed to require the concurrence of the commons as well as that of the upper house in the nomination was not complied with The lords alone assumed the power of appointing these officers The commons tacitly acquiesced in their choice and thought that for the present they had proceeded a sufficient length if they but advanced their pretensions tho' rejected of interposing in these more important matters of state  ON this footing then the government stood The administration was conducted entirely in the King's name No regency was expressly appointed The council and the great officers named by the peers did their duty each in his separate department And the whole system was for some years kept together by the secret authority of the King's uncles especially of the duke of Lancaster who was in reality the regent  THE parliament was dissolved after the commons had represented the necessity of their being reassembled once every year as appointed by law and after having elected two citizens as their treasurers to receive and disburse the produce of two fifteens and tenths which they voted to the crown In the other parliaments called during the minority the commons still discover a strong spirit of freedom and sense of their own authority which without breeding any disturbance tended to secure their independance and that of the people  In the fifth year of the King  the commons complained of the government about the King's person his court the excessive number of his servants of the abuses in the Chancery King's Bench C  mmon P  eas Exchequer and of grievous opp  sions in the country be the great multitudes of maintainers of quarrels  men linked in confederacies together  who behaved themselves like kings in the country so as th  re was very little law or right and of other things which they said were the cause of the late commotions under Wat Tyler  Parl Hist vol p This irregular government which no king and no house of commons had been able to remedy was the source of the licentiousness of the great and turbulency of the people as well as tyranny of the princes If subjects would enjoy liberty and Kings securi y the laws must be executed  In the ninth of this reign the commons also discovered an accuracy and a jealousy of liberty which we should little expect in these rude times  "It was agreed by parliament"  says Cotton p    "that the subsidy of wools woolfells and skins granted to the King until the time of Mid summer then ensuing should cease from the same time unto the feast of St Peter  ad vincula  for that thereby the King should be interrupted for claiming such grant as due"  See also Cotton p    EDWARD had left his grandson involved in many dangerous wars The pretensions of the duke of Lancaster to the crown of Castile made that kingdom  still persevere in hostilities against England Scotland whose throne was now filled by Robert Stewart nephew to David Bruce and the first prince of that family maintained such close connexions with France that war with the one crown almost necessarily produced hostilities with the other The French monarch whose prudent conduct had acquired him the sirname of  wife  as he had already baffled all the experience and valour of the two Edwards was likely to prove a dangerous enemy to a minor King but his genius which was not naturally enterprizing led him not at present to give any great disturbance to his neighbours and he laboured besides under many difficulties at home which it was necessary for him to surmount before he could think of making conquests in an enemy's country England was master of Calais Bourdeaux and Bayonne had lately acquired possession of Cherbourg from the cession of the King of Navarre and of Brest from that of the duke of Brittany  Rymer vol p  and having thus access into France from every quarter was able even in its present situation to give annoyance to his government Before Charles could remove them from these important p  sts he died in the flower of his age and left his kingdom to a minor son who bore the name of Charles VI  MEANWHILE the war with France was carried on in a manner somewhat languid and produced no enterprize of great lustre or renown Sir Hugh Calverley who had formerly headed a company of banditti in France for he as well as sir Robert Knolles and many of the most renowned commanders of Edward had once followed that dishonourable profession was governor of Calais  and making an inroad into Picardy with a detachment of the garrison he set fire to Boulogne  Walsing p  The duke of Lancaster conducted an army into Brittany but returned without being able to perform any memorable action In a subsequent year the duke of Glocester marched out of Calais with a body of cavalry and infantry and scrupled not with this small army to enter into the heart of France and to continue his ravages thro' Picardy Champaigne the Brie the Beausse the Gatinois the Orleanois till he reached his allies in the province of Brittany  Froissart liv chap Walsin p  The duke of Burgundy at the head of a more considerable army came within sight of him but the French were so overawed by the former successes of the English that no superiority of numbers could tempt them to venture a pitched battle with the troops of that nation As the duke of Brittany soon after the arrival of these succours formed an accommodation with the court of France this enterprize also proved in the issue unsuccessful and made no durable impression upon the enemy  THE expences of these armaments and the usual want of oeconomy attending a minority much exhausted the English treasury and obliged the parliament in order to supply it to impose a new and extraordinary tax of three groats on every person male and female above fifteen years of age and they ordained that in levying that tax the opulent should relieve the poor by an equitable compensation This imposition excited a mutiny which was very singular in its circumstances All history abounds with examples where the great tyrannize over the meaner sort But here the lowest populace rose against their rulers exercised the most cruel ravages upon them and took vengeance for all their former oppressions  THE faint dawning of the arts and of good government in that age had excited the minds of the populace in different states of Europe to wish for a better condition and to murmur against those chains which the laws enacted by the haughty nobility and gentry had so long imposed upon them The commotions of the people in Flanders the mutiny of the peasants in France were the natural effects of this growing spirit of independance and the report of these events being brought into England where personal slavery was more general than in any other country of Europe  Froissart liv chap  had prepared the minds of the multitude for an insurrection One John Ball also a seditious preacher who affected low popularity went about the country and inculcated on his audience the principles of the first origin of mankind from one common stock their equal right to liberty and to all the goods of nature the tyranny of artificial distinctions and the abuses which had arisen from the degradation of the more considerable part of the species and the aggrandizement of a few insolent rulers  Froissart liv chap Walsingham p  These doctrines so agreeable to the populace and so conformable to the ideas of primitive equality which are engraven in the hearts of all men were greedily received by the multitude and had scattered the sparks of that sedition which the present tax raised into a conflagration  Insurrection of the common people  THE imposition of three groats a head had been farmed out to tax gatherers in each county who levied the money with rigor on the people and the clause of making the rich ease their poorer neighbours of some share of the burden being so vague and undetermined had doubtless occasioned many partialities and made the people more sensible of the unequal lot which fortune had assigned them in the distribution of her favours The first disorder arose from a blacksmith in a village of Essex The taxgatherers came to this man's shop while he was at work and demanded payment for his daughter whom he asserted to be  below the age assigned by the statute One of these fellows offered to produce a very indecent proof to the contrary and at the same time laid hold of the maid Which the father resenting immediately knocked out the ruffian's brains with his hammer The bystanders applauded the action and exclaimed that it was full time for the people to take vengeance of their tyrants and to vindicate their native liberty They immediately flew to arms The whole neighbourhood joined in the sedition The flame spread in an instant over the whole county It soon propagated itself into that of Kent of Hertford Surrey Sussex Suffolk Norfolk Cambridge and Lincoln Before the government had the least warning of the danger the disorder had risen beyond controul or opposition The populace had shaken off all regard to their former masters And being headed by the most audacious and criminal of their associates who assumed the feigned names of Wat Tyler Jack Straw Hob Carter and Tom Millar by which they were fond of denoting their mean origin they committed every where the most outrageous violences on such of the gentry or nobility as had the misfortune to fall into their hands  th June  THE insurgents amounting to an hundred thousand men assembled on Blackheath under their leaders Tyler and Straw and as the princess of Wales the King's mother returning from a pilgrimage to Canterbury passed thro' the midst of them they attacked her company and some of the most insolent among them to show their purpose of levelling all mankind forced kisses from her but they allowed her to continue her journey without attempting any farther injury  Froissart liv chap  They sent a message to the King who had taken shelter in the Tower and desired a conference with him Richard sailed down the river in his barge but on approaching the shore he saw such symptoms of tumult and insolence that he put back and returned to that fortress  Froissart liv chap  The mutinous peasants mean wh le favoured by the city rabble had broke into London had burnt the duke of Lancaster's palace of the Savoy cut off the heads of all the gentlemen whom they laid hold of expressed a particular animosity against the lawyers and attornies and pillaged the warehouses of the rich merchants  Froissart liv chap Walsingham p  A great body of them quartered themselves at Mile end and the King finding no defence in the Tower which was weakly garisoned and ill supplied with provisions was obliged to go out to them and ask their demands They required a general pardon the abolition of slavery freedom of commerce in markettowns without tolls or imposts and a fixed rent on lands instead of the services due by villenage These requests which tho' extremely reasonable in themselves the nation was  not sufficiently prepared to receive and which it was dangerous to have extorted by violence were however complied with charters to that purpose were granted them and this body immediately dispersed and returned to their several homes  Froissart lib chap    DURING this transaction another body of the rebels had broke into the Tower had murdered Simon Sudbury the primate and chancellor with Sir Robert Hales the treasurer and some other persons of distinction and continued their ravages in the city  Walsingham p  The King passing along Smithfield very slenderly guarded met with Wat Tyler at the head of these rioters and entered into a conference with him Tyler having ordered his companions to retire till he should give them a signal after which they were to murder all the company except the King himself whom they were to detain prisoner feared not to come into the midst of the royal retinue He there behaved himself in such a manner that Walworth the mayor of London not able to bear his insolence drew his sword and struck him so violent a blow as brought him to the ground where he was instantly dispatched by others of the King's train The mutineers seeing their leader fall prepared themselves for revenge and this whole company with the King himself had undoubtedly perished on the spot had it not been for an extraordinary presence of mind which Richard discovered on this occasion He ordered his company to stop he advanced alone towards the enraged multitude and accosting them with an affable and intrepid countenance he asked them  "What is the meaning of this disorder my good people Are you angry that you have lost your leader I am your King I will be your leader"  The populace overawed by his presence implicitly followed him He led them out into the fields to prevent any disorder which might have arisen by their continuing in the city Being there joined by Sir Robert Knolles and a body of well armed veteran soldiers who had been secretly drawn together he strictly prohibited that officer from falling on the rioters and committing an undistinguished slaughter upon them and he peaceably dismissed them with the same charters which had been granted to their companions  Froissart vol chap Walsingham p  Knyghton p    Soon after the nobility and gentry hearing of the King's danger in which they were all involved flocked to London with their adherents and retainers and Richard took the field at the head of an army strong  Walsingham p    It then behoved all the other rebels to submit The charters of enfranchisement and pardon were revoked by parliament the low people were reduced to the same slavish condition as before and several of the ringleaders were severely punished for the late disorders It was pretended that the intentions of the insurgents had been to seize the King's person to carry  him thro' England at their head to murder all the nobility gentry and lawyers and even all the bishops and priests except the mendicant friars to dispatch afterwards the King himself and having thus reduced all the people to a level to order the kingdom at their pleasure  Walsingham p  It is not impossible that many of them in the delirium of their first success might have formed such projects But of all the evils attending human society the insurrections of the populace when not raised and supported by persons of higher quality is the least to be dreaded The mischiefs consequent on an abolition of all rank and distinction become so great that they are immediately felt and soon bring back affairs to their former order and arrangement  A youth of sixteen which was at this time the King's age that had discovered so much courage presence of mind and address and had so dextrously eluded the violence of this tumult gave great hopes to the nation and it was natural to expect that he would in the course of his life equal all the glories which had so uniformly attended his father and his grandfather in all their undertakings  But in proportion as Richard advanced in years these hopes were blasted and his want of capacity at least of solid judgment appeared in every enterprize which he attempted The Scots sensible of their own deficiency in cavalry had app ied to the regency of Charles VI and John de Vienne admiral of France had been sent over with a body of men at arms to support them in their incursions against the English The danger was now deemed by the King's uncles somewhat serious and a great army of men was levied and conducted against Scotland with Richard himself at the head of it The Scots pretended not to make resistance to so great a force They abandoned without scruple their country to be pillaged and destroyed by the enemy And when de Vienne expressed his surprize at this plan of operations they told him that all their cattle was driven into the forests and fastnesses that their houses and other goods were of no value and that they well knew how to compensate themselves for any losses which they might sustain in that respect by making an invasion on the English Accordingly when Richard entered Scotland by Berwic and the east coast the Scots and French to the number of men passed the borders of England by the west and carrying on their ravages thro Cumberland Westmoreland and Lancashire collected a rich booty and then returned in tranquillity to their own country Richard mean while advanced towards Edinburgh and destroyed in his way all the towns and villages on each side of him He reduced that city to ashes He treated in the same manner Perth Dundee and other places in the Low Countries but when he was advised  to march towards the west coast to await there the return of the enemy and to take revenge on them for their devastations his impatience to be in England and enjoy his usual pleasures and amusements was more prevalent and he carried back his army without effecting any thing by all these mighty preparations The Scots soon after finding the solid bodies of French cavalry very useless in that desultory kind of war to which they confined themselves treated their allies so ill that the French returned home very much disgusted with the country and the manners of its inhabitants  Froissart liv chap c liv chap Walsingham p  The English tho' they regretted the indolence and dissolute manners of their King saw themselves for the future secured against any dangerous invasion from that quarter  BUT it was so material an interest of the French court to wrest the sea port towns from the hands of their enemy that they resolved to attempt it by some other expedient and found no means so likely as by an invasion of England itself They collected an immense fleet and army at Sluise for the Flemings were now in alliance with them All the nobility of France were engaged in this enterprize The English were kept in alarm Great preparations were made for the reception of the invaders And tho' the dispersion of the French ships by a storm and the taking of many of them by the English before the embarkation of the troops freed the kingdom from the present danger they were fully sensible that this perilous situation might every moment return upon them  Froissart liv chap Walsingham p    THERE were two circumstances chiefly which engaged the French at this time to think of such attempts The one was the absence of the duke of Lancaster who had carried into Spain all the flower of the English military force in prosecution of his vain claim to the crown of Castile an enterprize in which after some promising success he was finally disappointed The other was the violent dissensions and disorders which had taken place in the English government  THE subjection in which Richard was held by his uncles particularly by the duke of Glocester a prince of enterprize and genius tho' it was not unsuitable to his years and slender capacity was extremely disagreeable to his violent temper and he began to rebel against the yoke imposed upon him Robert de Vere earl of Oxford a young man of a noble family of an agreeable figure but of dissolute manners had acquired an entire ascendant over him and ruled him with the most absolute authority The King knew so little bounds to his affection that he first created his favourite marquis of Dublin a title before unknown in England and then duke of Ireland and transferred to him by patent which  was confirmed in parliament the entire sovereignty for life of that island  Cotton p Cox's hist of Ireland p Walsingham p  He gave him in marriage his cousin german the daughter of Ingelram de Couci earl of Bedford but soon after permitted him to repudiate that lady tho' of an unexceptionable character and to marry a foreigner a Bohemian with whom he had become enamoured  Walsingham p  These public declarations of attachment turned the whole court towards the favourite All graces passed thro' his hands Access to the King c uld only be obtained thro' his mediation And Richard seemed to take no pleasure in royal authority but so far as it enabled him to load with favours and titles and dignities this object of his affections  Discontent of the barons  THE jealousy of power immediately produced an animosity between the minion and his creatures on the one hand and the princes of the blood and chief nobility on the other and the usual complaints against the insolence of favourites were loudly echoed and greedily received in every part of the kingdom Mowbray earl of Nottingham the mareschal FitzAlan earl of Arundel Piercy earl of Northumberland Montacute earl of Salisbury Beauchamp earl of Warwic were all connected with each other and with the princes by friendship or alliances and still more by their antipathy to those who had eclipsed them in the King's favour and confidence No longer kept in awe by the personal character of the prince they scorned to submit to his ministers and the methods which they took to redress the grievance complained of well suited the violence of that age and the desperate extremities to which every opposition was sure to be instantly carried  MICHAEL DE LA POLE the present chancellor and lately created earl of Suffolk was the son of an eminent merchant but had risen by his abilities and valour during the wars of Edward III had acquired the friendship of that monarch and was esteemed the person of greatest experience and capacity among those who were attached to the duke of Ireland and the King's secret council The duke of Glocester who had the house of commons at his devotion impelled them to exercise that power which they seem first to have assumed against lord Latimer during the declining years of the late King and an impeachment against the chancellor was carried up by them to the house of peers which was no less at his devotion The King foresaw the tempest preparing against him and his ministers After attempting in vain to rouse the Londoners to his defence he withdrew from parliament and retired with his court to Eltham The parliament sent a deputation inviting him to return and threatening that if he continued to absent himself they would immediately dissolve and leave the nation  tho' at that time in imminent danger of a French invasion without any support or supply for its defence At the same time a member was encouraged to call for the record containing the parliamentary deposition of Edward II a plain intimation of the fate which Richard if he continued refractory had reason to expect from them The King finding himself unable to resist was contented to stipulate that except finishing the present impeachment against Suffolk no attack should be made against any other of his ministers and on that condition he returned to the parliament  Knyghton p c The same author p tells us that the King in return to the message said that he would not for their desire remove the meanest scullion from his kitchen This author also tells us that the King said to the commissioners when they harangued him that he saw his subjects were rebellious and his best way would be to call in the King of France to his aid But it is plain that all these speeches were either intended by Knyghton merely as an ornament to his history or are false For when the five lords accuse the King's ministers in the next parliament and impute to them every rash action of the King they speak nothing of these replies which are so obnoxious were so recent and are pretended to have been so public The King so far from having any connexions at that time with France was threatened with a dangerous invasion from that kingdom This story seems to have been taken from the reproaches afterwards thrown out against him and to have been transferred by the historian to this time to which they cannot be applied    NOTHING can prove more fully the innocence of Suffolk than the frivolousness of the articles which his enemies in the present plenitude of their power thought proper to object against him  Cotton p Knyghton p  It was alleged that being chancellor and obliged by his oath to consult the King's profit he had purchased lands of the crown below their true value that he had exchanged with the King a perpetual annuity of marks a year which he enjoyed from his father and which was assigned upon the customs of the port of Hull for lands of an equal income that having obtained for his son the priory of St Anthony which was formerly possessed by a Frenchman an enemy and a schismatic and a new prior being at the same time named by the Pope he had refused to admit this person till he made a composition with his son and agreed to pay him an hundred pounds a year from the benefice that he had purchased from one Tydeman of Limborch an old and forfeited annuity of fifty pounds a year upon the crown and had engaged the King to admit that bad debt upon his revenues and that when created earl of Suffolk he had obtained a grant of pounds a year to support the dignity of that title  It is probable that the earl of Suffolk was not rich nor able to support the dignity without the bounty of the crown For his father Michael de la Pole tho' a great merchant had been ruined by lending money to the late King See Cotton p We may remark that the dukes of Glocester and York tho' vastly rich received at the same time each of them a thousand pounds a year to support their dignity Rymer vol p Cotton p  Even the proof of these articles frivolous as they  are was found very defective upon the trial It appeared that Suffolk had made no purchases of the crown while he was chancellor and that all his bargains of that kind were made before he was advanced to that dignity  Cotton p  It is almost needless to add that he was condemned notwithstanding his defence and that he was deprived of his office  GLOCESTER and his associates observed their stipulation with the King and attacked no more of his ministers But they immediately attacked himself and his royal d gnity and framed a commission after the model of those which had been attempted almost in every reign since that of Richard I and which had always been attended with the most extreme confusion  Knyghton p Statutes at large Rich II chap  By this commission a council of fourteen persons were appointed all of Glocester's faction except Nevil archbishop of York The sovereign power was transferred to these men for a twelvemonth The King who had now reached the twenty first year of his age was in reality dethroned The aristocracy was rendered supreme And tho' the term of the commission was limited to a twelvemonth it was easy to foresee that the intentions of the party were to render it perpetual and that power would with great difficulty be wrested from those grasping hands to which it was once committed Richard however was obliged to submit He signed the commission he took an oath never to infringe it and tho' at the end of the session he  publick y  entered a protest that the prerogatives of his crown notwithstanding his late concession should still be deemed entire and unimpaired  Cotton p  the new commissioners without regarding it proceeded to the exercise of their authority  C  vil commotions  THE King thus dispossest of royal power was soon sensible of the contempt into which he was fallen His favourites and ministers who were as yet allowed to remain about his person failed not to aggravate the injury which without any demerit on his part had been offered to him And his eager temper was of itself sufficiently inclined to seek the means both of recovering his authority and of revenging himself on those who had invaded it As the house of commons appeared now of some weight in the constitution he tried secretly some expedients for procuring a favourable election He sounded some of the sheriffs who being at that time both the returning officers and magistrates of great power in the counties would naturally have considerable influence in elections But as most of them had been appointed by his uncles either during his minority or during the course of the present commission he found them in general averse to his enterprize The sentiments and inclinations of the judges were more favourable  to him He met at Nottingham sir Robert Tresilian chief justice of the King's Bench sir Robert Belknappe chief justice of the Common Pleas sir John Cary chief baron of the Exchequer Holt Fulthorpe and Bourg inferior justices and Lokton serjeant at law and he proposed to them some queries which these lawyers either from the influence of his authority or of reason made no scruple of answering in the way he desired They declared that the late commission was derogatory to the royalty and prerogative of the King that those who procured it or advised the King to consent to it were punishable with death that those who necessitated and compelled him were guilty of treason that those were equally criminal who should persevere in maintaining it that the King has the right of dissolv ng parliaments when he pleases that the parliament while it sits must proceed first upon the King's business and that that assembly cannot without the King's consent impeach any of his ministers and judges  Knyghton p Ypod Neust p  Even according to our present strict maxims with regard to law and the royal prerogative all these determinations except the two last were entirely justifiable And as the great privileges of the commons particularly that of impeachment were hitherto very new and supported by few precedents there want not reasons of apology for these opinions of the judges They signed therefore their answer to the King's queries before the archibishops of York and Dublin the bishops of Durham Chichester and Bangor the duke of Ireland the earl of Suffolk and two other counsellors of inferior quality  THE duke of Glocester and his adherents soon got intelligence of this secret consultation and were naturally much alarmed at it They saw the King's intention not only of recovering his authority but of punishing them for invading it and they determined to prevent the execution f his purpose As soon as he came to London which they knew was well disposed to their party they secretly assembled their forces and appeared in arms at Haringaypark near Highgate with a power which Richard and his ministers were not able to resist They sent him a message by the archbishop of Canterbury and the lords Lovel Cobham and Devereux and demanded that the persons who had seduced him by their pernicious council and were traitors both to him and to the kingdom should be delivered to them A few days after they appeared in his presence armed and attended with armed followers and they accused by name the archbishop of York the duke of Ireland the earl of Suffolk sir Robert Tresilian and sir Nicholas Brembre as publick and dangerous enemies to the state They threw down their gauntlets before the King and fiercely offered to maintain  the truth of their charge by duel The persons accused and all the other obnoxious ministers had withdrawn or concealed themselves  THE duke of Ireland fled to Cheshire and levied some forces with which he advanced to relieve the King from the violence of the nobles Glocester encountered him in Oxfordshire with much superior forces routed him dispersed his followers and obliged him to fly into the LowCountries where he died in exile a few years after  d February  The lords then appeared at London with an army of men and having obliged the King to summon a parliament which was entirely at their devotion they had full power by observing a few legal forms to take vengeance on all their enemies  Expulsion or execution of the King's ministers  Five great peers men whose combined power was able at any time to shake the throne Thomas duke of Glocester the King's uncle Henry earl of Derby son of the duke of Lancaster Richard earl of Arundel and Surrey Thomas earl of Warwic and Thomas earl of Nottingham and mareschal of England entered before the parliament an accusation or appeal as it was called against the five counsellors whom they had already accused before the King The parliament who ought to have been judges were not ashamed to impose an oath on all their members by which they bound themselves to live and die with the lords appellants and to defend them against all their enemies with their lives and fortunes  Cotton p    THE other proceedings were well suited to the violence and iniquity of the times A charge consisting of thirtynine articles was delivered in by the appellants and as none of the accused counsellors except sir Nicholas Brembre was in custody the rest were cited to answer and upon their nonappearance after a very short interval without hearing a witness without examining a fact or deliberating on one point of law the house of peers declared them guilty of high treason Sir Nicholas Brembre who was produced in court had the appearance and probably no more than the appearance of a trial The peers tho' they were not by law his proper judges pronounced in a very summary manner sentence of death upon him and he was executed together with Sir Robert Tresilian who had been discovered and taken in the interval  IT would be tedious to recite the whole charge delivered in against the five counsellors which is to be met with in several collections  Knyghton p Tyrrel vol part p from the records Parliamentary History vol p  It is sufficient to observe in general that if we reason upon the supposition which is the true one that the royal prerogative was invaded by the commission given to the duke of Glocester and his associates and that the King's person was afterwards detained  in custody by rebels many of the articles will appear not only to imply no crime in the duke of Ireland and the ministers but to impute to them actions which were laudable and which they were bound by their allegiance to perform The few articles respecting the conduct of th  se ministers before that commission which subverted the constitution and annihilated all justice and legal authority are vague and general such as their engrossing the King's favour keeping the grandees at a distance from  m obtaining unreasonable grants for themselves or their creatures and dissipating the public treasure by useless expences No violence is objected to them no particular illegal act  We must except the th article which accuses Brembre of having cut off the heads of twentytwo prisoners confined for felony or debt without warrant or process of law But as it is not conce vable what interest Brembre could have to treat these felons and debtors in such a manner we may presume that the fact is either false or misrepresented It was in these mens power to say any thing against the persons accused No defence or apology was admitted All was lawless will and pleasure  They are also accused of designs to murder the lords but these accusations either are general or destroy one another Sometimes as in article th they intend to murder them by means of the mayor and city of London Sometimes as in article th by trial and false inquests Sometimes as in article th by means of the King of France who was to receive Calais for his pains  no breach of any statute and their administration may therefore be concluded to have been so far innocent and inoffensive All the disorders indeed seem to have proceeded not from any infringement of the laws attempted by the ministers but merely from a rivalship of power which the duke of Glocester and the great nobility agreeable to the genius of the times carried to the utmost extremity against their opponents without any regard to reason justice or humanity  BUT these were not the only acts of violence committed during the triumph of the party All the other judges who had signed the extrajudicial opinions at Nottingham were condemned to death and were as a grace or favour banished to Ireland tho' they pleaded the fear of their lives and the menaces of the King's ministers as their excuse The lord Beauchamp of Holt sir James Berners and sir John Salisbury were also tried and condemned for high treason merely because they had attempted to defeat the late commission But the life of the latter was spared The sate of sir Simon Burley was more severe This gentleman was much beloved for his personal merit had distinguished himself by many honourable actions  At least this is the character given of him by Froissart liv who knew him personally Walsing p gives a very different character of him but he is a writer somewhat passionate and partial and the choice made of this gentleman by Edward III and the Black prince for the education of Richard makes the character given of him by Froissart much more probable  was created knight of the garter and had been appointed governor to Richard by the choice of the late King and the Black prince He  had attended his master from the earliest infancy of that prince and had ever remained extremely attached to him Yet all these considerations could not save him from falling a victim to Glocester's vengeance This execution more than all the others made a deep impression on Richard's mind His Queen too for he was already married to the sister of the Emperor Wincheslaus King of Bohemia interested herself extremely in behalf of Burley She remained three hours on her knees before the earl of Glocester pleading for that gentleman's life but tho' she was become extremely popular by her amiable qualities which had acquired her the appellation of  the good Queen Ann  her petition was sternly rejected by that inexorable tyrant  THE parliament concluded this violent scene by a declaration that none of the articles decided on these trials to be treason should ever afterwards be drawn into precedent by the judges who were still to consider the statute of the twentyfifth of Edward as the rule of their conduct The house of lords seem not at that time to have known or acknowledged the principle that they themselves were bound in their judicial capacity to follow the rules which they had established in their legislative  In general the parliament in those days never paid a proper regard to Edward's statute of treasoas tho' one of the most advantageous laws for the subject that has ever been enacted In the th of the King  the dukes of Lancaster and Glocester complain to Richard that Sir Th  mas Talbot with others of his adherents conspired the death of the said dukes in divers parts of Cheshire as the same was confessed and well known and praying that the parliament may judge of the fault Whereupon the King and the lords in the parliament judged the same fact to be open and high treason And hereupon they award two writs the one to the sheriff of York and the other to the sheriffs of Derby to take the body of the  aid Sir Thomas returnable in the King's bench in the month of Easter then ensuing And open proclamation was made in Westminsterball that upon the sheriff's return and at the next coming in of the said Sir Thomas the said Thomas should be convicted of treason and incur the loss and pain of the same And all such as should receive him after the proclamation should incur the same loss and pain  Cotton p It is to be observed that this extraordinary judgment was passed in a time of tranquillity Tho' the statute itse f of Edward III reserves a power to the parliament to declare any new species of treason it is not to be supposed that this power was reserved to the house of lords alone or that men were to be judged by a law  ex post facto  At least if such be the meaning of the clause it may be affirmed that men were at that time very ignorant of the first principles of law and justice  It was also enacted that every one should swear to the perpetual maintenance and support of the forfeitures and attainders and of all the other acts passed during this parliament The archbishop of Canterbury added the penalty of excommunication as a farther security of these deeds of violence  IT might naturally be expected that the King being reduced to such slavery by the combination of the princes of the blood and the chief nobility and having appeared so unable to defend his servants from the most cruel effects of their resentment would long remain in subjection to them and never would recover  the royal power without the most violent struggles and convulsions But the event proved otherwise In less than a twelvemonth Richard who was in his twentythird year declared in council that as he had now attained the full age which intitled him to govern by his own authority his kingdom and household he resolved to exercise his right of sovereignty and when no one ventured to contradict so reasonable an intention he deprived FitzAlan archbishop of Canterbury of the dignity of chancellor and bestowed that high office on William of Wickham bishop of Winchester the bishop of Hereford was displaced from the office of treasurer the earl of Arundel from that of admiral even the duke of Glocester and the earl of Warwic were removed for a time from the councilboard And no opposition was made to these great changes The history of this reign is very imperfect and very little to be depended on except where it is supported by the public records And it is not easy for us to assign the reason of this unexpected event Perhaps some secret animosities naturally to be expected in that situation had crept in among the great men and enabled the King to recover his authority Perhaps the violence of their former proceedings had lost them the affections of the people who soon repent of any cruel extremities to which they are carried by their leaders However this may be Richard exercised with moderation the authority which he had resumed He seemed to be entirely reconciled to his uncles  Dugdale vol p  and the other great men of whom he had so much reason to complain He never attempted to recal from banishment the duke of Ireland whom he found so obnoxious to them He confirmed by proclamation the general pardon which the parliament had passed for all offences And he courted the affections of the people by voluntarily remitting some subsidies which had been granted him a remarkable and almost a singular instance of such generosity  AFTER this composure of domestic differences and restoration of the government to its natural state there passes an interval of eight years which affords not many remarkable events The duke of Lancaster returned from Spain having resigned to his rival all pretensions to the crown of Castile upon payment of a large sum of money  Knyghton p Walsingham p  and having married his daughter Philippa to the King of Portugal The authority of this prince served to counterbalance that of the duke of Glocester and secured the power of Richard who paid great court to his eldest uncle by whom he had never been offended and whom he found more moderate in his temper than the younger He made a cession to him for life of the dutchy of Guienne ‖ which the inclinations and changeable humour of the Gascons had  ‡ Rymer vol p  restored to the English government but as they remonstrated loudly against this deed it was finally with the duke's consent revoked by Richard  Rymer vol p    There happened an incident which produced a dissension between Lancaster and his two brothers After the death of the Spanish princess he espoused Catharine Swineford daughter of a private knight of Hainault by whose alliance York and Glocester thought the dignity of their family much injured But the King gratified his uncle by passing in parliament a charter of legitimation to the children whom that lady had born him before marriage and by creating the eldest earl of Somerset  Cotton p Walsingham p    THE wars mean while which Richard had inherited with his crown still continued tho' interrupted by frequent truces according to the practice of that age and conducted with little vigor by reason of the weakness of all parties The French war was scarce heard of the tranquillity of the northern borders was only interrupted by one inroad of the Scots which proceeded more from a rivalship between the two martial families of Piercy and Douglas than from any national quarrel A fierce battle or skirmish was fought at Otterborne  th August  in which young Piercy sirnamed  Hotspur  from his impetuous valor was taken prisoner and Douglas slain and the victory remained undecided  Froissart lib chap Walsingham p    Some insurrections of the Irish obliged the King to make an expedition into that country which he reduced to obedience and he recovered in some degree by this enterprize his character of courage which had suffered a little by the inactivity of his reign  At last the English and French courts began to think in earnest of a lasting peace but found it so difficult to adjust their opposite pretensions that they were contented to establish a truce of twentyfive years  Rymer vol p  Brest and Cherbourg were restored the former to the duke of Brittany the latter to the King of Navarre Both parties were left in possession of all the other places which they held at present And to render the amity between the two crowns more durable Richard who was now a widower was affianced to Isabella the daughter of Charles  Rymer vol p  This princess was only seven years of age but the King agreed to so unequal a match chiefly that he might fortify himself by this alliance against the enterprizes of his uncles and the incurable turbulency as well as inconstancy of his barons  THE administration of the King tho' it was not in this interval sullied by any unpopular act except the seizure of the charter of London  Rymer vol p Walsingham p  which was  soon after restored had not tended much to fortify his authority and his personal character brought him into contempt even while his public government appeared in a good measure unexceptionable Indolent expensive addicted to low pleasures he spent his whole time in feasting and jollity and dissipated in idle show or in bounty to favourites of no reputation that revenue which the people expected to see him employ in enterprizes directed to public honour and advantage He forgot his rank by admitting all men to his familiarity and he was not sensible that their acquaintance with the qualities of his mind was not able to impress them with the respect which he neglected to preserve from his birth and station The earls of Kent and Huntington his half brothers were his chief confidents and favourites and tho' he never devoted himself to them with so profuse an affection as that with which he had been attached to the duke of Ireland it was easy for men to see that every grace passed thro' their hands and that the King had rendered himself a mere cypher in the government The small regard which the public bore to his person disposed them to murmur against his administration and to receive with greedy ears every complaint which the discontented or ambitious grandees suggested to them  Cabals of the duke of Glocester  GLOCESTER soon perceived all the advantages which this dissolute conduct gave him and finding that both resentment and jealousy on the side of his nephew still prevented him from acquiring any ascendant over that prince he determined to cultivate his popularity with the nation and to revenge himself on those who eclipsed him in favour and authority He seldom appeared at court or in council He never declared his opinion but in order to disapprove of the measures embraced by the King and his favourites And he courted the friendship of every man whom disappointments or private resentment had rendered an enemy to the administration The long truce with France was very unpopular with the English who breathed nothing but war against that hostile nation and Glocester took care to encourage all the vulgar prejudices which prevailed on this subject Forgetting the misfortunes which attended the English arms during the latter years of Edward he made an invidious comparison between the glories of that reign and the inactivity of the present and he lamented that Richard should have degenerated so far from the heroic virtues by which his father and his grandfather were distinguished The military men were inflamed with a desire of war when they heard him talk of the signal victories formerly obtained and of the easy prey which might be made of the French riches by the superior valor of the English The populace readily embraced the same sentiments And all men exclaimed that this prince whose councils were so much neglected was the true support of English honour and alone able to  raise the nation to its former height of power and splendor His great abilities his popular manners his princely extraction his immense riches his high office of constable  Rymer vol p  all these advantages not a little assisted by his want of courtfavour gave him a mighty authority in the kingdom and rendered him extremely formidable to Richard and his ministers  FROISSART  Liv Chap  a contemporary author and very impartial but whose credit is somewhat impaired by his want of exactness in material facts ascribes to the duke of Glocester more desperate views and such as were totally incompatible with the government and domestic tranquillity of the nation According to that historian he proposed to his nephew Roger Mortimer earl of Marche whom Richard had declared his successor to give him immediate possession of the throne by the deposition of a prince so unworthy of government and authority And when Mortimer declined this project he resolved to make a partition of the kingdom between himself his two brothers and the earl of Arundel and to dispossess Richard entirely of the crown The King it is said being informed of these designs saw that either his own ruin or that of Glocester was inevitable and he resolved by a hasty blow to prevent the execution of such destructive projects This is certain that Glocester by his own confession had often affected to speak contemptuously of the King's person and government had deliberated concerning the lawfulness of throwing off allegiance to him and had even born part in a secret conference where his deposition was proposed and talked of and determined  Cotton p  Tyrrel vol part p from the records Parliamentary History vol p That this confession was genuine and obtained without violence may be entirely depended on Judge Rickhill who brought it over from Calais was tried on that account and acquitted in the first parliament of Henry IV when Glocester's party was prevalent His acquittal notwithstanding his innocence may even appear marvellous considering the times See Cotton p  But it is reasonable to think that his schemes were not so far advanced as to make him think of their immediate execution The danger probably was still too distant to render a desperate remedy entirely necessary for the security of the government  BUT whatever opinion we may form of Glocester's conspiracies his aversion to the French truce and alliance was public and avowed and that court which had now a great influence over the King pushed him to provide for his own safety by taking revenge of the dangerous designs of his uncle The resentment of his former violences revived the sense of his refractory and uncompliant behaviour was still recent and a man whose ambition had once usurped royal authority and murdered all the faithful servants of the King was thought capable  on a favourable opportunity of renewing the same treasonable enterprizes The King's precipitant temper admitted of no deliberation He ordered Glocester to be unexpectedly arrested to be hurried into a ship which was lying in the river and to be carried over to Calais where alone he thought that by reason of his numerous partizans he could safely be detained in custody  Froissart liv chap Walsing p  The earls of Arundel and Warwic were seized at the same time The malecontents so suddenly deprived of their leaders were astonished and overawed And the concurrence of the dukes of Lancaster and York in those measures with that of the earls of Derby and Rutland the sons of these princes  Rymer vol p  bereaved them of all possibility of resistance  th Sept  A PARLIAMENT was immediately summoned at Westminster and the King doubted not to find the peers and still more the commons very compliant with his will This house had in a former parliament given him very sensible proofs of their obedience  In the former parliament the commons had shewn themselves in a disposition to be very complaisant to the King yet there happened an incident in their proceedings which is very curious and shews us the state of the house in that period The members were either country gentlemen or merchants who were assembled for a few days and were entirely unacquainted with business so that it was easy to lead them astray and draw them into votes and resolutions very different from their settled purpose A member had proposed some petitions concerning the state of the nation in which among other things the house recommended frugality to the King and for that purpose desired that the court should not be so much frequented as formerly with  bishops  and  ladies  The King was displeased with this freedom The commons very humbly craved pardon He was not satisfied unless they would name the mover of that petition It happened to be one Haxey whom the parliament in order to make attonement condemned for this offence to die the death of a traitor But the King at the desire of the archbishop of Canterbury and the prelates pardoned him When a parliament in those times not agitated by any faction and being at entire freedom could be guilty of such monstrous extravagance it is easy to judge what might be expected from them in more trying situations See Cotton's abridg p  and the present suppression of Glocester's party made him still more assured of a favourable election As a farther expedient for that purpose he is also said to have employed the influence of the sheriffs a practice which as it was then somewhat new gave great umbrage but which the established authority of that assembly rendered afterwards more familiar to the nation Accordingly the parliament passed whatever acts the King was pleased to dictate to them  The nobles brought numerous retainers with them to give them security as we are told by Walsingham p The King had a few Cheshire men for his guard  They annulled forever the commission which usurped upon the royal authority and declared it treasonable to attempt in any future period the revival of any similar commission  Statutes at large Richard II  They abrogated all the acts which  attainted the King's ministers and which that parliament who passed them and the whole nation had sworn inviolably to maintain And they declared the general pardon then granted to be invalid as extorted by force and never ratified by the free consent of the King Tho' Richard after he resumed the government and l y no longer under constraint had voluntarily by proclamation confirmed  general indemnity this circumstance seemed not in their eyes to merit the  consideration Even a particular pardon granted six years after to the earl of Arundel was annulled by parliament upon pretence that it was procured by surprize and that the King was not then acquainted with the degree of guilt incurred by that nobleman  THE commons then entered an impeachment against FitzAlan archbishop of Canterbury and brother to Arundel and accused him of his concurrence in procuring the illegal commission and in attainting the King's ministers The primate pleaded guilty but as he was protected by the ecclesiastical privileges the King was satisfied with a sentence which banished him the kingdom and sequestered his temporalities  C  tton p  An appeal or accusation was presented against the duke of Glocester and the earls of Arundel and Warwic by the earls of Rutland Kent Huntington Somerset Salisbury and Nottingham together with the lords Spencer and Scrope and they were accused of the same crimes which had been imputed to the archbishop as well as of their appearance against the King in a hostile manner at Haringaypark The earl of Arundel who was brought to the bar very wisely confined all his defence to the pleading both the general and particular pardon of the King but was overruled condemned and executed  Cotton p Froissart liv chap Walsing p  The earl of Warwic who was also convicted of high treason was on account of his submissive behaviour pardoned as to his life but doomed to perpetual banishment in the Isle of Man No new acts of treason were imputed to either of these noblemen The only crimes for which they were condemned were the old attempts against the crown which seemed to be obliterated both by the distance of time and by repeated pardons  Tyrrel vol part p from the records  The reasons of this method of proceeding it is difficult to conjecture The recent conspiracies of Glocester seem certain from his own confession But perhaps the King and ministry had not at that time in their hands any satisfactory proof of their reality perhaps it was difficult to convict Arundel and Warwic of any concurrence in them perhaps an enquiry into these conspiracies would have involved in the guilt some of those great noblemen who now concurred with the crown and whom it was necessary to cover from all imputation or perhaps the King according to the genius of  that age was very indifferent about saving even the appearances of justice and equity and was only solicitous by any means to ensure success in these prosecutions This point like many others in antient history we are obliged to leave altogether undetermined  Murder of the duke of Glocester  A WARRANT was issued to the earl Mareschal governor of Calais to bring over the duke of Glocester in order to his trial but the governor returned for answer that the duke had died suddenly of an apoplexy in that fortress Nothing could be more suspicious than the time of that prince's death It became immediately the general opinion that he was murdered by orders from his nephew In the subsequent reign undoubted proofs were produced to parliament that he had been suffocated with pillows by his keepers  Cotton  Dugdale vol p  And it appeared that the King apprehensive lest the public trial and execution of so popular a prince and so near a relation might prove both dangerous and invidious had taken this base method of gratifying and as he fancied concealing his revenge upon him Both parties in their successive triumphs seem to have had no farther concern than that of retaliating upon their adversaries and neither of them were aware that in imitating they indirectly justified asfar as it lay in their power all the illegal violences of the opposite party  THIS session concluded with the creation or advancement of several peers the earl of Derby was made duke of Hereford the earl of Rutland duke of Albemarle the earl of Kent duke of Surrey the earl of

William Scrope earl of Wiltshire  Cotton p  The parliament after a session of twelve days was men adjourned to Shrewsbury The King before the departure of the members exacted of them an oath for the perpetual maintainance and establishment of th  r acts similar to that which had formerly been required by the duke of Glocest  and his party and which had already proved so vain and fruitless  th January  BOTH King and parliament met in the same dispositions at Shrewsbury So anxious was Richard for the security of these acts that he obliged the lords and commons to swear anew to them on the cross of Canterbury  Cott  Walsingham p  and he soon after procured a bull from the Pope by which they were as he imagined perpetually secured and established § The parliament on the other hand conferred on him  for life  the  on wool woolfells and leather and granted him besides  a subsidy of one whole tenth and fifteenth and of a half tenth and fifteenth They also reversed the attainder of Tresilian and the other judges and with the approbation of the present judges declared the answers for which these magistrates had been impeached to be just and legal  Statutes at large Rich II  And they carried so far their retrospect as to reverse on the petition of the lord Spencer earl of Glocester the attainder pronounced against the two Spencers in the reign of Edward II  Cotton p  The antient history of England is nothing but a catalogue of reversals Every thing is in fluctuation and movement One faction is continually undoing what was established by another And the multiplied oaths which each party requires for the security of the present acts betray a perpetual consciousness of their instability  THE parliament before they were dissolved elected a committee of twelve lords and six commoners  The names of the commissioners were the dukes of Lancaster York Albemarle Surrey and Exeter the marquis of Dorset the earls of March Salisbury Northumberland Glocester Winchester and Wiltshire John Bussey Henry Green John Rassel Robert Teye Henry Chelmeswike and John Golofre It is to be remarked that the duke of Lancaster always concurred with the rest in all their proceedings even in the banishment of his son which was afterwards so much complained of  whom they vested with the whole power both of lords and commons and endowed with full authority to finish all business which had been laid before the houses and which they had not had leisure to bring to a conclusion  Cotton p Walsingham p  This was a very unusual concession and tho' it was limited in the object might either immediately or as a precedent have proved dangerous to the constitution But the cause of that extraordinary measure was an event very singular and unexpected which engaged the attention of the parliament  AFTER the destruction of the duke of Glocester and the heads of that party a misunderstanding broke out among those noblemen who had joined in the prosecution and the King wanted either authority sufficient to appease it or foresight to prevent it The duke of Hereford appeared in parliament and accused the duke of Norfolk of having spoke to him in private many slanderous words of the King and of having imputed to his majesty an intention of subverting and destroying many of his principal nobility  Cotton p Parliamentary history vol p  Norfolk denied the charge gave Hereford the lie and offered to prove his innocence by duel The challenge was accepted The time and place of combat were appointed And as the event of this important trial by arms might require the interposition of legislative authority the parliament thought it more suitable to delegate their power to a  committee than to prolong the session beyond the usual time which custom and general convenience had prescribed to it  In the first year of Henry VI when the authority of parliament was great and when that assembly could least be suspected of lying under violence a like concession was made to the council from like motives of convenience See Cotton p    THE duke of Hereford was certainly very little delicate in point of honour to betray a private conversation to the ruin of the person who entrusted him and we may thence be more inclined to believe the duke of Norfolk's denial than the other's asseveration But Norfolk had in these transactions betrayed an equal neglect of honour which brings him entirely to a level with his antagonist Tho' he had publickly joined with the duke of Glocester and that party in all the former violences put upon the King and his name stands among the appellants who accused the duke of Ireland and the other ministers Yet was he not ashamed publickly to impeach his former associates for the very crimes which he had concurred with them in committing and his name encreases the list of those appellants who brought them to a trial Such were the principles and practices of those antient knights and barons during the prevalence of the feudal government and the reign of chivalry  THE lists for this decision of truth and right were appointed at Coventry before the King All the nobility of England bandied into parties and adhered either to the one duke or the other The whole nation was held in suspence with regard to the event But when the two champions appeared in the field accoutered for the combat the King interposed to prevent both the present effusion of such noble blood and the future consequences of the quarrel By the advice and authority of the parliamentary commissioners he stopped the duel and to show his impartiality he ordered by the same authority both the combatants to leave the kingdom  Cotton p Walsingham p  assigning one country for the place of Norfolk's exile which he declared perpetual and another for that of Hereford which he limited to ten years  HEREFORD was a man of great prudence and command of temper and he behaved himself with so much submission in these delicate circumstances that the King before his departure promised to shorten the term of his exile four years and he also granted him letters patent by which he was empowered in case any inheritance should in the mean time fall to him to enter immediately in possession and to postpone the doing homage till his return  Banishment of Henry duke of Hereford  THE weakness and fluctuation of Richard's councils appear no where more evident than in the conduct of this affair No sooner had Henry left the kingdom  than the King's jealousy of the immense power and riches of that family revived and he was sensible that by Glocester's death he had only removed a counterpoize to the Lancastrian interest which was now become formidable to his crown and kingdom Being informed that Hereford had opened a treaty of marriage with the daughter of the duke of Berry uncle to the French King he determined to prevent the finishing of an alliance which would extend so much the interest of that nobleman into foreign countries and he sent over the earl of Salisbury to Paris with a commission for that purpose  d Feb  The death of the duke of Lancaster which happened soon after called upon him to take new resolutions with regard to that opulent succession The present duke in consequence of the King's patent desired to be put in possession of the estate and jurisdictions of his father But Ri hard afraid of strengthening the hands of a man whom he had already so sensibly injured applied to the parliamentary commissioners and pursuaded them that this affair was but an appendage of that business which the parliament had delegated to them By their authority he revoked his letters patent and retained possession of the estate of Lancaster And by the same authority he seized and tried the duke's attorney who had procured and insisted on the letters and had him condemned as a traitor for faithfully executing that trust to his master  Tyrrel vol part p from the records  A most extravagant act of power even tho' the King changed in favour of the attorney the penalty of death into that of banishment  HENRY the new duke of Lancaster had long acquired by his conduct and abi ities the esteem of the public and having served with distinction against the infidels in Lithuania he had joined to his other praises those of piety and valour virtues which have at all times a great influence over mankind and were during those ages the qualities chiefly held in estimation  Walsingham p  He was connected with most of the principal nobility by blood alliances or friendship and as the injury done him by the King might in its consequences affect all of them he easily brought them by a sense of common interest to take part in his resentment The people who must have an object of affection and who found nothing in the King's person which they could love or revere and were even disgusted with many parts of his conduct  He levied fines from those who had ten years before joined the duke of Glocester and his party They were obliged to pay him money before he would allow them to enjoy the benefit of the indemnity and in the articles of charge against him it is asserted that the payment of one fine did not suffice It is indeed likely that his ministers would abuse the power put into their hands and this grievance extended to very many people Historians agree in representing this practice as a great oppression See Otterburn p  easily transferred to Henry that attachment  which the death of the duke of Glocester had left without any fixed direction His misfortunes were lamented the injustice which he had suffered complained of and all men turned their eyes towards him as the only person who could retrieve the lost honour of the nation or redress the supposed abuses of the government  of Henry  WHILE such was the disposition of the people Richard had the imprudence to embark for Ireland in order to revenge the death of his counsin Roger earl of Marche the presumptive heir of the crown who had lately been slain in a skirmish by the natives and he thereby left the kingdom of England open to the attempts of his provoked and ambitious enemy  th July  Henry embarking at Nantz with a retinue of sixty persons among whom were the archbishop of Canterbury and the young earl of Arundel nephew to that prelate landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire and was immediately joined by the earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland two of the most potent barons in England He here took a solemn oath that he had no other purpose in this invasion than to recover the dutchy of Lancaster unjustly detained from him and he invited all his friends in England and all lovers of their country to second him in this reasonable and moderate pretension Every place was in commotion The malecontents in all quarters flew to arms London discovered the strongest symptoms of its disposition to mutiny and rebellion And Henry's army encreasing on every day's march soon amounted to the number of men  General insurrection  THE duke of York was left guardian of the realm a place to which his birth intitled him but which both his slender abilities and his natural connexions with the duke of Lancaster rendered him utterly incapable of filling in such a dangerous emergency All the chief nobility who were attached to the crown and who could either have seconded the guardian's good intentions or have overawed his infidelity had attended the King into Ireland and the efforts of Richard's friends were every where more feeble than those of his enemies The duke of York however appointed the rendezvous of his forces at St Albans and soon assembled an army of men but found them entirely destitute of zeal and attachment to the royal cause and more inclined to join the party of the rebels He hearkened therefore very readily to a message from Henry who entreated him not to oppose a loyal and humble supplicant in the recovery of his legal patrimony and the Guardian even declared publicity that he would second his nephew in so reasonable a request His army embraced with acclamations the same party and the duke of Lancaster reinforced by their numbers was now intirely master of the kingdom He hastened to Bristol into which some of the King's ministers had thrown themselves and soon obliging that place to surrender  he yielded to the cries of the populace and without giving them a trial ordered the earl of Wiltshire Sir John Bussy and Sir Henry Green whom he there took prisoners to be led out to immediate execution  THE King receiving intelligence of this invasion and insurrection hastened over from Ireland and landed in Milford Haven with a body of men But even this army so much inferior to the enemy were either overawed by the general combination of the kingdom or seized with the same spirit of rebellion and they gradually deserted him till he found that he had not above men who followed his standard It appeared therefore necessary to retire secretly from this small body which served only to expose him to danger and he fled to the isle of Anglesea where he purposed to embark either for Ireland or France and there await the favourable opportunities which the return of his subjects to a sense of duty or their future discontents against the duke of Lancaster would probably afford him Henry sensible of this danger sent to him the earl of Northumberland with the strongest professions of loyalty and submission and that nobleman by treachery and false oaths made himself master of the King's person and carried him to his enemy at Flint castle  st Septr  Richard was conducted to London by the duke of Lancaster who was there received with the acclamations of the mutinous populace It is pretended that the Recorder met him on the road and in the name of the city entreated him for the public safety to put Richard to death with all his adherents who were prisoners  Walsingham  but the duke very prudently determined to make many others participate of his guilt before he would proceed to those extremities For this purpose he issued writs of election in the King's name and appointed the immediate meeting of a parliament at Westminster  SUCH of the peers as were the most devoted to the King were either fled or imprisoned and no opponents even among the barons dared to appear against Henry amid that scene of outrage and violence which commonly attends revolutions more especially in England during those turbulent ages And it is also easy to imagine that a house of commons elected during this universal ferment and this triumph of the Lancastrian party would be extremely attached to that cause and ready to second every suggestion of their leader That order being as yet of too little weight to stem the torrent was always carried along with it and served only to encrease the violence which the public interest required it should endeavour to controul  D  on of the King  The duke of Lancaster therefore sensible that he would be entirely master began to carry his views to the crown itself and he deliberated with his partizans concerning the most proper means of effecting his violent purpose He  first extorted a resignation from Richard  Knyghton p Otterbourne p    th Sept  but as he knew that that deed would plainly appear the result of force and fear he also proposed notwithstanding the danger of the precedent to himself and his posterity to have him solemnly deposed in parliament for his pretended tyranny and misconduct A charge consisting of thirtythree articles was accordingly drawn up against him and presented to that assembly  Tyrrel vol part p from the records Knyghton p Otterbourne p    IF we examine these articles which are expressed with extreme acrimony against Richard we shall find that except some rash speeches which are imputed to him  Art  and of whose reality as they are said to have passed in private conversation we may very reasonably entertain some doubt the chief amount of the charge is contained in his violent conduct during the last years of his reign and naturally divides itself into two principal heads The first and most considerable is the revenge which he took on the princes and great barons who had formerly usurped and still persevered in controuling and threatning his authority the second is the violation of the laws and general privileges of his people But the former however irregular in many of its circumstances was fully supported by authority of parliament and was but a copy of the violence which the princes and barons themselves during their former triumph had exercised against him and his party The detention of Lancaster's estate was properly speaking a revocation by the appearance at least of parliamentary authority of a grace which the King himself had formerly granted him The murder of Glocester for the secret execution however merited of that prince certainly deserves this appellation was a private deed formed not any precedent and implied not any assumed or arbitrary power of the crown which could justly give umbrage to the people It was really the effect of the King's weakness rather than ambition and proves that instead of being dangerous to the constitution he possessed not even the authority requisite for the execution of the laws  THE second head of accusation as it consists mostly of general facts and was framed by Richard's inveterate enemies and was never allowed to be answered by him or his friends it is more difficult to form a judgment of The greatest part of these grievances objected to Richard seems to be the exertion of arbitrary prerogatives such as the dispensing power  Art  levying purveyance  Art  employing the marshal's court  Art  extorting loans  Art  granting protections from lawsuits  Art  prerogatives which tho' often complained of had often been exercised by his predecessors and still continued to be so by his successors But whether his irregular  acts of this kind were more frequent and injudicious and violent than usual or were only laid hold of and more exaggerated by the factions to which the weakness of his reign had given birth we are not able at this distance to determine with certainty There is however one circumstance in which his conduct is visibly different from that of his grandfather He is not accused of having imposed one arbitrary tax without consent of parliament during his whole reign  We learn from Cotton p  that the King by his chancellor told the commons  that they were  and namely in forbearing to charge them with  ines and fifteens the which  no more    These words  no more  allude to the practice of his predecessors He had not himself imposed any arbitrary taxes Even the parliament in the  of his deposition tho' they complain of heavy taxes affirm not that they were imposed illegally or by arbitrary will  Scarce a year passed during the reign of Edward which was free from complaints with regard to this grievous and dangerous exertion of authority But perhaps the great ascendant which Edward had acquired over his people together with his great prudence enabled him to make a use very advantageous to his subjects of this and other arbitrary prerogatives and rendered them a smaller grievance in his hands than a less absolute authority in those of his grandson This is a point which it would be rash for us to decide positively on either side but it is certain that a charge drawn up by the duke of Lancaster and assented to by a parliament situated in these circumstances forms no manner of presumption with regard to the unusual irregularity or violence of the King's conduct in this particular  To show how little credit is to be given to this charge against Richard we may observe that a law in the Edw III had been made against the continuance of sheriffs for more than one year But the inconvenience of changes having afterwards appeared from experience the commons in the twentieth of this King applied by petition that the sheriffs might be continued tho' that petition had not been enacted into a statute by reason of other disagreeable circumstances which attended it See Cotton p It was certainly a very moderate exercise of the dispensing power for the King to continue the sheriffs after he found that that practice would be acceptable to his subjects and had been applied for by one house of parliament Yet is this made an article of charge against him by the present parliament See art Walsingham speaking of a period early in Richard's minority says  signify when after they are made they take no effect since the King  takes upon him to  or  set aside all th  se things which by  ordained in parliament  If Richard therefore exercised the dispensing power  warranted by the examples of his uncles and grandfather and indeed of all his predecessors from Henry III    WHEN the charge against Richard was presented to the parliament tho' it was liable almost in every article to objections it was not canvassed nor examined nor disputed in either house and seemed to be received with unanimous approbation One man alone the bishop of Carlisle had the courage amidst  this universal disloyalty and violence to appear in defence of his unhappy master and to plead his cause against all the power of the prevailing party Tho' some topics employed by that virtuous prelate may seem to favour too much the doctrine of passive obedience and to make too large a sacrifice of the rights of mankind he was naturally pushed into that extreme by his abhorrence of the present licentious factions and such intrepidity as well as disinterestedness of behaviour proves that whatever his speculative principles were his heart was elevated far above the meanness and abject submission of a slave He represented to the parliament that all the abuses of government which could justly be imputed to Richard far from amounting to tyranny were merely the result of error youth or misguided council and admitted of a remedy more easy and salutary than a total subversion of the constitution That even had they been much more violent and dangerous than they really were they had chiefly proceeded from former examples of resistance which making the prince sensible of his precarious situation had obliged him to establish his throne by irregular and arbitrary expedients That a rebellious disposition in subjects was the principal cause of tyranny in Kings Laws could never secure the subject which did not give security to the sovereign And if the maxim of inviolable loyalty which formed the basis of the English government were once rejected the privileges belonging to the several orders of the state instead of being fortified by that licentiousness would thereby lose the surest foundation of their force and stability That the parliamentary deposition of Edward II far from making a precedent which could controul this maxim was only the example of successful violence and it was sufficiently to be lamented that crimes were so often committed in the world without establishing principles which might justify and authorize them That even that precedent false and dangerous as it was could never warrant the present excesses which were so much greater and which would entail distraction and misery on the nation to their latest posterity That the succession at least of the crown was then preserved inviolate The lineal heir was placed on the throne And the people had an opportunity by their legal obedience to him of making atonement for the violences which they had committed against his predecessor That a descendant of Lionel duke of Clarence the elder brother of the late duke of Lancaster had been declared in parliament successor to the crown He had left posterity And their title however it might be overpowered by present force and faction could never be obliterated from the min s of the people That if the turbulent disposition alone of the nation had overturned the wellestablished throne of so good a prince as Richard what bloody commotions must ensue when the same cause was united to the motive of restoring the legal  and undoubted heir to his authority That the new government intended to be established would stand on no principles and would scarce retain any pretence by which it could challenge the obedience of men of sense or virtue That the claim of lineal descent was so gross as scarcely to deceive the most ignorant of the populace Conquest could never be pleaded by a rebel against his sovereign The consent of the people had no authority in a monarchy not derived from consent but established by hereditary right and however the nation might be justified in deposing the misguided Richard it could never have any reason for passing by his lawful heir and successor who was plainly innocent And that the duke of Lancaster would give them but a bad specimen of the legal moderation which might be expected from his future government if he added to the crime of his past rebellion the guilt of excluding the family which both by right of blood and by declaration of parliament would in case of Richard's decease or voluntary resignation have been received as the undoubted heirs of the monarchy  Sir John Heywarde p    ALL the circumstances of this event compared to those attending the late revolution in show the difference between a great and a civilized nation deliberately vindicating its established privileges and a turbulent and barbarous aristocracy plunging headlong from the extremities of one faction into those of another This noble freedom of the bishop of Carlisle instead of being applauded was not so much as tolerated He was immediately arrested by orders of the duke of Lancaster and sent a prisoner to the abbey of St Albans No farther debate was attempted Thirtythree long articles of charge were in one meeting voted against Richard and voted unanimously by the same peers and prelates who a little before had voluntarily and unanimously authorized those very acts of violence of which they now complained That prince was deposed by the suffrages of both houses and the throne being now vacant the duke of Lancaster stepped forth and having crossed himself on his forehead and on his breast and called upon the name of Christ  Cotton p  he pronounced these words which we shall give in the original language because of their singularity  In the name of Fadher Son and Holy Ghost I Henry of Lancaster challenge this rewme of Ynglande and the croun with all the membres and the appurtenances als I that am d  scendit by right line of the blode coming fro the gude King Henry therde and throge that right that God of his grace hath sent me with helpe of kyn and of my frendes to recover it the which rewme was in poynt to be ondone by defaut of governance and ondoying of the gude lawes  Knyghton p    IN order to understand this speech it must be observed that there was a silly story received among some of the lowest vulgar that Edmond earl of Lancaster  son of Henry III was really the elder brother of Edward I but that by reason of some deformities in his person he had been postponed in the succession and his younger brother imposed on the nation in his stead As the present duke of Lancaster inherited from Edmond by his mother this genealogy made him the true heir of the monarchy and it is therefore insinuated in Henry's speech But the absurdity was too gross to be openly avowed either by him or by the parliament The case is the same with regard to his right of conquest He was a subject who rebelled against his sovereign He entered the kingdom with a retinue of no more than sixty persons He could not therefore be the conqueror of England and this right is accordingly insinuated not avowed Still there is a third claim derived from his merits in saving the nation from tyranny and oppression and this claim is also insinuated But as it seemed by its nature better calculated as a reason for his being  elected  King by a free choice which he was determined never to avow than for giving him an immediate right of possession he durst not speak openly even on this head and to obviate any notion of election he challenges the crown as his due either by acquisition or inheritance The whole forms such a piece of jargon and nonsense as is almost without example No objection however was made to it in the parliament The unanimous voice of lords and commons placed Henry on the throne He became King nobody could tell how or wherefore The title of the house of Marche formerly recognized by parliament was neither invalidated nor repealed but passed over in total silence And as a concern for the liberties of the people seems to have had no hand in this revolution their right to dispose of the government as well as all their other privileges was left precisely on the same footing as before But Henry having when he claimed the crown dropped some obscure hint concerning conquest which it was thought might endanger these privileges he soon after made a public declaration that he did not thereby intend to deprive any one of his franchises or liberties  Knyghton p Otterborn p  Which was the only circumstance that had common sense or meaning in all these transactions  th October  THE subsequent events discover the same headlong violence of conduct and the same rude notions of civil government The deposition of Richard dissolved the parliament It was necessary to summon a new one And Henry in six days after called together without any new election the same members and this assembly he denominated a new parliament They were employed in the usual task of reversing every deed of the opposite party All the acts of the last parliament of Richard which had been confirmed by their oaths and by a papal bull were abrogated All the acts which had passed in the parliament where  Glocester prevailed and which had been abrogated by Richard were again reestabl shed  Cotton p    The answers of Tresillian and the other judges which a parliament had annulled but which a new parliament and new judges had approved here received a second condemnation The peers who had accused Glocester Arundel and Warwic and who had received higher titles for that piece of service were all of them degraded from their new dignities Even the practice of prosecuting appeals in parliament was wholly abolished and trials were restored to the course of common law  Henry iv cap  The natural effect of this conduct was to render the people giddy with such rapid and perpetual changes and to make them lose all notions of right and wrong in the measures of government  d October  THE earl of Northumberland made a motion in the house of peers with regard to the unhappy prince whom they had deposed He asked them what advice they would give the King for the future treatment of him since Henry was resolved to spare his life They unanimously replied that he should be imprisoned under a secure guard in some secret place and should be deprived of all commerce with any of his friends or partizans It was easy to foresee that he would not remain long alive in the hands of such barbarous and sanguinary enemies  Murder of the King  Historians differ with regard to the manner in which he was murdered It was long the prevailing opinion that sir Piers Exton and others of his guards fell upon him in the castle of Pomfret where he was confined and dispatched him with their halberts But it is more probable that he was starved to death in prison and after all subsistence was denied him he prolonged his unhappy life it is said for a fortnight before he reached the end of his miseries This account is more consistent with the story that his body was exposed in public and that no marks of violence were observed upon it He died in the thirty fourth year of his age and the twentythird of his reign He left no posterity either legitimate or illegitimate  His character  ALL the writers who have transmitted to us the history of Richard composed their works during the reigns of the Lancastrian princes and candor requires that we should not give entire credit to the reproaches which have been thrown upon his memory But after making all proper abatements he still appears to have been a weak prince and unfit for government less for want of natural parts and capacity than of solid judgment and of a good education He was violent in his temper profuse in his expences fond of idle show and magnificence devoted to favourites and addicted to pleasure Passions all of them the most inconsistent with a prudent oeconomy and consequently dangerous in a limited and mixed government Had he possessed the talents of gaining and still more  those of overawing his great barons he might have escaped all the misfortunes of his reign and been allowed to carry much farther his oppressions over the people if he really was guilty of any without their daring to rebel or even to murmur against him But when the grandees were tempted by his want of prudence and of vigour to resist his authority and execute the most violent enterprizes upon him he was naturally led to seek for an opportunity of retaliation justice was neglected the lives of the chief nobility sacrificed and all these evils seem to have proceeded less from a settled design of establishing arbitrary power than from the insolence of victory and the necessities of the King's situation The manners indeed of the age were the chief source of such violences Laws which were seebly observed in peaceable times lost all their authority during public convulsions Both parties were alike guilty Or if any difference may be remarked between them we shall find that the authority of the crown being more legal was commonly carried when it prevailed to less desperate extremities than those of the aristocracy  ON comparing the conduct and events of this reign with those of the preceding we shall find equal reason to admire Edward and to blame Richard but the circumstance of opposition surely will not lie in the strict regard paid by the former to national privileges and the neglect of them by the latter On the contrary the prince of small abilities as he felt his want of power seems to have been always more moderate in this respect than the other Every parliament assembled during the reign of Edward remonstrate against the exertion of some arbitrary prerogative or other We hear not any complaints of that kind during the reign of Richard till the assembling of his last parliament which was summoned by his inveterate enemies which dethroned him which framed their complaints during the time of the most furious convulsions and whose testimony can therefore have on that account much less authority with every equitable judge  Compare in this view the abridgement of the records by sir Robert Cotton during these two reigns  Both these princes experienced the encroachments of the Great upon their authority Edward reduced to necessities was obliged to make an express bargain with his parliament and to sell some of his prerogatives for present supply but as they were acquainted with his genius and capacity they ventured not to demand any exorbitant concessions or such as were incompatible with regal and sovereign power The weakness of Richard tempted the parliament to extort a commission which in a manner dethroned the prince and transferred the sceptre into the hands of the nobility The events were also suitable to the character of each Edward had no sooner got the supply than he departed from the engagements which had induced the parliament to grant it he openly  told his people that he had but  dissembled  with them when he seemed to make them these concessions and he resumed and retained all his prerogatives But Richard because he was detected in consulting and deliberating with the judges on the lawfulness of restoring the constitution found his barons immediately in arms against him was deprived of his liberty saw his favourites his ministers his tutor butchered before his face or banished and attainted and was obliged to give way to all this violence There cannot be a more remarkable opposition between the fortunes of two princes It were happy for society that this opposition depended always on the justice or injustice of the measures which men embrace and not rather on the different degrees of prudence and vigour with which these measures are supported  Miscellaneous tran  act  ons duri  g this reign  There was a sensible decay of the authority of the ecclesiastics during this period The disgust which the laity had received from the numerous usurpations both of the court of Rome and of their own clergy had weaned the kingdom very much from superstition and strong symptoms appeared from time to time of a general desire to shake off the bondage of the Romish church In the committee of eighteen to whom Richard's last parliament delegated their whole power there is not the name of one ecclesiastic to be found a neglect which is almost without example while the Catholic religion subsisted in England  The following passage in Cotton's abridgment p shows a strange prejudice against the church and churchmen  The commons afterwards coming into the parliament and making their protesta  shewed that for want of good redress about the King's person in his household in all his courts touching  in every county and purveyors the commons were daily pilled and nothing defended aga  nst the enemy and that it should shortly deprive the King and undo the state Wherefore in the same government  requ  re redress Whereupon the King appointed sundry bishops lords and nobles to sit in privy  about these matters Who since that they must begin at the head and go at the request of the commons they  the presence of the King charged his confessor not to come into the court but upon the four    We should little expect that a Popish privy council in order to preserve the King's morals  order his confessor to be kept at a distance from him This incident happened in the minority of Richard As the popes had for a long time resided at Avignon and the majority of the sacred college were Frenchmen this circumstance naturally encreased the aversion of the nation to the papal po  But the prejudice against the English clergy cannot be accounted for from that cause    THE aversion entertained against the established church soon found principles and tenets and reasonings by which it could justify and support itself John Wickliffe a secular priest educated at Oxford began in the latter end of Edward III to spread the doctrines of reformation by his discourses sermons and writings and he made many disciples among men of all ranks and stations He seems to have been a man of parts and learning and has the honour of being the first person in Europe who publickly called in question those doctrines which had universally passed for certain and undisputed during so many ages  Wickliffe himself as well as his disciples who received the name of Wickliffites or Lollards was distinguished by a remarkable austerity of life and manners a circumstance common to almost all those who dogmatize in any new way both because men who draw to them the attention of the public and expose themselves to the odium of great multitudes are obliged to be very guarded in their conduct and because few who have a strong propensity to pleasure or business will enter upon so difficult and laborious an undertaking The doctrines of Wickliffe being derived from his search into the scriptures and into ecclesiastical antiquity were nearly the same with those propagated by the reformers in the sixteenth century He only carried some of them farther than was done by the more sober part of these reformers He denied the doctrine of the real presence the supremacy of the church of Rome the merit of monastic vows He maintained that the scripture was the sole rule of faith that the church was dependant on the state and ought to be reformed by it that the clergy ought to possess no estates that the begging friars were a general nuisance and ought not to be supported  Walsingham p Spelman concil vol p Knyghton p  that the numerous ceremonies of the church were hurtful to true piety He asserted that oaths were unlawful that dominion was founded in grace that every thing was subject to fate and destiny and that all men were predestinated either to eternal salvation or reprobation  Harpsfield p Waldens tom lib art cap  From the whole of his doctrines Wickliffe appears to have been strongly tinctured with enthusiasm and to have been thereby the better qualified to oppose a church whose distinguishing character was superstition  THE propagation of these principles gave great alarm to the clergy and a bull was issued by Pope Gregory XI for taking Wickliffe into custody and examining into the scope of his opinions  Spelm conc vol p Walsingham p  Courteney bishop of London cited him before his tribunal but the reformer had now got very powerful protectors who screened him from the ecclesiastical jurisdiction The duke of Lancaster who then governed the kingdom encouraged the principles of Wickliffe and he made no scruple as well as lord Piercy the mareschal to appear openly in court with him in order to give him countenance upon his trial He even insisted that Wickliffe should sit in the bishop's presence while his principles were examined Courtney exclaimed against this insult The mob of London thinking their prelate affronted attacked the duke and mareschal who escaped from their hands with some difficulty  Harpsfield in Hist Wickl p  And the populace soon after broke into the  houses of both these noblemen threatned their persons and plundered their goods The bishop of London had the merit of appeasing their fury and resentment  THE duke of Lancaster however still continued his protection to Wickliffe during the minority of Richard and the principles of that reformer had so far propagated themselves that when the Pope sent to Oxford a new bull against these doctrines the university deliberated for some time whether they should receive the bull and they never took any vigorous measures in consequence of the papal orders  Wood's Ant Oxon  ib p c W  lsingham p  Even the populace of London were at length brought to entertain favourable sentiments of this reformer When he was cited before a synod at Lambeth the mob broke into the assembly and so overawed the prelates who found both the people and the court against them that they dismissed him without any farther censures  THE clergy we may well believe were more wanting in power than inclination to punish this new heresy which struck at all their credit possessions and authority But there was hitherto no law in England by which the secular arm was empowered to support orthodoxy and the ecclesiastics endeavoured to supply the defect by a very extraordinary and very unwarrantable artifice In the year there was an act passed enjoining sheriffs to apprehend the preachers of heresy and their abettors but this statute had been surreptitiously obtained by the clergy and had the formality of an enrolment without the consent of the commons In the subsequent session the lower house complained of this fraud affirmed that they had no intention to bind themselves to the prelates farther than their ancestors had done before them and required that the pretended statute should be repealed which was done accordingly  Cotton's abridgment p  But it is remarkable that notwithstanding this vigilance of the commons the clergy had so much art and influence that the repeal was suppressed and the act which never had any legal authority remains to this day upon the statute book  Rich II chap  Tho' the clergy still thought proper to keep it in reserve and not proceed to the immediate execution of it  BUT besides the defect of power in the church which saved Wickliffe that reformer himself notwithstanding his enthusiasm seems not to have been actuated by the spirit of martyrdom and in all subsequent trials before the prelates he so explained away his doctrine by tortured meanings as to render it quite innocent and inoffensive  Walsingham p Knyghton p  Most of his followers imitated his cautious disposition and saved themselves either by recantations or explanations He died of a palsy in t  year  at his rectory of Lutterworth in the county of Leicester and the clergy mortifi  d that he should have escaped their vengeance took care  besides assuring people of his eternal damnation to represent his last distemper as a visible judgment of heaven upon him for his multiplied heresies and impieties  Walsingham p Ypod Neust p    THE proselytes however of Wick iffe's opinions still encreased in England  Knyghton p  Some monkish writers represent the half of the kingdom as infected by them They were carried over to Bohemia by some youth of that nation who studied in Oxford But tho' the age seemed strongly disposed to receive them affairs were not yet fully ripe for this great revolution and the finishing blow to ecclesiastical power was reserved to a period of more curiosity literature and inclination for novelties  MEANWHILE the English parliament continued to check the clergy and the court of Rome by more sober and more legal expedients They enacted anew the statute of  provisors  and affixed higher penalties to the transgression of it which in some instances was even made capital  Rich II cap Rich II cap  The court of Rome had fallen upon a new device which encreased their authority over the prelates The Pope who found that the expedient of arbitrarily depriving them was violent and liable to opposition attained the same end by transferring such of them as were obnoxious to poorer sees and even to nominal sees  in partibus infidelium  It was thus that the archbishop of York and the bishops of Durham and Chichester the King's ministers had been treated after the prevalence of Glocester's faction The good bishop of Carlisle met with the same fate after the accession of Henry IV For the Pope always joined with the prevailing powers when they did not thwart his pretensions The parliament in the reign of Richard enacted a law against this abuse And the King made a general remonstrance to the court of Rome against all those impositions which he calls  horrible excesses  of that court  Rymer vol p    It was usual at this time for the church that they might elude the mortmain act to make their votaries leave lands in trust to certain persons under whose name the clergy enjoyed the benefit of the bequest The parliament also stopped the progress of this abuse  Knyghton p Cotton p  In the th of the King the commons prayed  that remedy might be had against such religious persons as cause their villains to marry free women inheritable whereby the estate comes to those religious hands by collusion  Cotton p  This was a new device of the clergy  THE papacy was at this time somewhat weakened by a schism which lasted for forty years and gave great scandal to the devoted partizans of the holy see After the Popes had resided many years at Avignon Gregory XI was persuaded to return to Rome and upon his death which happened in the Romans  resolute to fix for the future the seat of the papacy in Italy besieged the cardinals in the conclave and constrained them tho' they were mostly Frenchmen to elect Urban VI an Italian into that high dignity The French cardinals so soon as they recovered their liberty fled from Rome and protesting against the forced election chose Robert son of the count of Geneva who took the name of Clement VII and resided at Avignon All the kingdoms of Christendom according to their several interests and inclinations were divided between these two pontiffs The court of France adhered to Clement and were followed by their allies the King of Castile and King of Scotland England of course was thrown into the other party and declared for Urban Thus the appellation of  Clementines  and  Urbanists  distracted Europe for several years and each party damned the other as schismatics and as rebels to the true vicar of Christ But this circumstance tho' it weakened the papal authority had not so great an effect as might naturally be imagined Tho' any King could easily at first make his kingdom embrace the party of one Pope or the other or even keep it some time in suspence between them he could not so easily transfer his obedience at pleasure The people attached themselves to their own party as to a religious opinion and conceived an extreme abhorrence to the opposite party whom they regarded at little better than Saracens or infidels Croisades were even undertaken in this quarrel and the zealous bishop of Norwich in particular led over in near bigots into Flanders against the Clementines but after losing a great part of his followers he returned with disgrace into England  Froissart lib chap Walsingham p c Knyghton p  Each Pope sensible from this prevailing spirit of the people that the kingdom which once embraced his cause would always adhere to him boldly maintained all the pretensions of his see and stood not much more in awe of the sovereigns than if his authority had not been endangered by a rival  WE meet with this preamble to a law enacted at the very beginning of this reign  "Whereas divers persons of small garrison of land or other possessions do make great retinue of people as well of esquires as of others in many parts of the realm giving to them hats and other livery of one suit by year taking again towards them the value of the same livery or percase the double value by such covenant and assurance that every of them shall maintain other in all quarrels be they reasonable or unreasonable to the great mischief and oppression of the people c  Rich II chap  "  This preamble contains a true picture of the state of the kingdom The laws were so feebly executed even during the long active  and vigilant reign of Edward III that no subject could trust to their protection Men openly associated themselves under the patronage of some great man for their mutual defence They had public badges by which their confederacy was distinguished They supported each other in all quarrels iniquities extortions murders robberies and other crimes Their chieftain was more their sovereign than the King himself and their own band was more connected with them than their country Hence the perpetual turbulence disorders factions and civil wars of those times Hence the small regard paid to a character or the opinion of the public Hence the large discretionary prerogatives of the crown and the danger which might have ensued from the too great limitation of them If the King had possessed no arbitrary powers while all the nobles assumed and exercised them there must have ensued an absolute anarchy in the state  ONE great mischief attending these confederacies was the extorting from the King pardons for the most enormous crimes The parliament often endeavoured in the last reign to deprive the prince of this prerogative but in the present they were contented with an abridgement of it They enacted that no pardon for rapes or murder from malice prepense should be valid unless the crime was particularly specified in it  Rich II Chap    There were also some other circumstances required for the passing any pardons of this kind An excellent law but ill observed like most laws which thwart the manners of the people and the prevailing customs of the times  IT is easy to observe from these voluntary associations among the people that the whole force of the feudal system was in a manner dissolved and that the English had nearly returned in that particular to the same situation in which they stood before the Norman conquest It was indeed impossible that that system could long subsist under the constant revolutions to which landed property is every where subject When the great feudal baronies were first erected the lord lived in opulence in the midst of his vassals He was in a situation to protect and cherish and defend them The quality of patron naturally united itself to that of superior And these two principles of authority mutually supported each other But when by the various divisions and mixtures of property a man's superior came to live at a distance from him and could no longer give him shelter or countenance the tie gradually became more fictitious than real New connexions from neighbourhood or other causes were formed Protection was sought by voluntary services and attachment The appearance of valor spirit ability in any great man extended his interest very far And if the sovereign was deficient in these  qualities he was equally if not more exposed to the usurpations of the aristocracy than even during the vigor of the feudal system  THE greatest novelty introduced into the civil government during this reign was the creation of peers by patent The lord Beauchamp of Holt was the first peer who was advanced to the house of lords in this manner The practice of levying benevolences is also first mentioned in this reign  CHAP XVIII HENRY IV  Title of the KingAn insurrectionAn insurrection in WalesThe earl of Northumberland rebelsBattle of ShrewsburyState of ScotlandParliamentary transactionsDeathand character of the King  T  tle of the King  THE English had so long been familiarized to the hereditary succession of their monarchy the instances of departure from it had always born such strong symptoms of injustice and violence and so little of a national choice or election and the returns to the true line had ever been deemed such fortunate incidents in their history that Henry was afraid lest in resting his title on the consent of the people he should build on a foundation to which the people themselves were not accustomed and whose solidity they would with difficulty be brought to recognize The idea too of choice seemed always to imply that of conditions and a liberty of recalling the consent upon any supposed violation of them an idea which was not naturally agreeable to a sovereign and might be dangerous to the people themselves who lying so much under the influence of turbulent nobles had ever paid but a very imperfect obedience even to their hereditary princes For these reasons Henry was determined never to have recourse to this claim the only one on which his authority could consistently stand He chose rather to patch up his title in the best manner he could from other pretensions And in the end he left himself in the eyes of men of sense no foundation of right but his present possession a very precarious claim which  by its very nature was liable to be overthrown by every faction of the great or prejudice of the people He had indeed a present advantage over his competitor The heir of the house of Mortimer who had been declared in parliament the true heir of the crown was a boy of seven years of age  Dugdale vol i p  His friends consulted his safety by keeping silence with regard to his title Henry detained him and his younger brother in an honourable custody at Windsor castle But he had reason to dread that in proportion as that nobleman grew to man's estate he would draw to him the attachment of the people and make them reflect on the fraud violence and injustice by which he had been excluded from the throne Many favourable topics would occur in his behalf He was born in the country possessed an extensive interest from the greatness and alliances of his family however criminal the deposed monarch might be this youth was entirely innocent he was of the same religion and educated in the same manners with the people and could not be governed by any separate interest These views would all concur to favour his claim and tho' the abilities of the present prince might ward off any dangerous revolution it was justly to be apprehended that his authority could with difficulty be brought to equal that of his predecessors  HENRY in his very first parliament had reason to see the danger attending that station which he had assumed and the obstacles which he would meet with in governing an unruly aristocracy always divided by faction and still more inflamed with the resentments consequent on such recent convulsions The peers on their assembling broke out into violent animosities forty gauntlets the gages of furious battle were thrown on the floor of the house of lords by noblemen who gave mutual challenges to each other and  liar  and  traitor  resounded from all quarters The King had so much authority with these doughty champions as to prevent all the combats which they threatened but he was not able to bring them to a proper composure or to an amicable disposition towards each other  An insurrection  IT was not long before these passions broke out in action The calls of Rutland Kent and Huntington and lord Spencer who were now degraded from the titles of Albemarle Surry Exeter and Glocester conferred on them by Richard entered into a conspiracy together with the earl of Salisbury and lord Lumley for raising an insurrection and for seizing the King's person at Windsor  Walsingham p Otterbourne p  but the treachery of Rutland gave him warning of the danger He suddenly withdrew to London and the conspirators who came to Windsor with a body of horse found that they had missed this blow on which all the success of their enterprize depended Henry  appeared next day at Kingston upon Thames at the head of men mostly drawn from the city and his enemies unable to resist his power dispersed themselves with a view of raising their followers in the several counties which were the seat of their interest But the adherents of the King were hot in the pursuit and every where opposed themselves to their progress The earls of Kent and Salisbury were seized at Cirencester by the citizens and were next day beheaded without farther ceremony according to the custom of the times  Walsingham p Ypod Neust p  The citizens of Bristol treated Spencer and Lumley in the same manner The earl of Huntington sir Thomas Blount Sir Benedict Sely who were also taken prisoners suffered death with many others of the conspirators by orders from Henry And when the quarters of these unhappy men were brought to London no less than eighteen bishops and thirtyfour mitred abbots joined the populace and met them with the most indecent marks of joy and exultation  BUT the spectacle the most shocking to every one who retained any sentiment either of honour or humanity still remained The earl of Rutland appeared carrying on a pole the head of lord Spencer his brotherinlaw which he presented in triumph to Henry as a testimony of his loyalty This infamous man who was soon after duke of York by the death of his father and first prince of the blood had been instrumental in the murder of his uncle the duke of Glocester  Dugdale vol ii p  had then deserted Richard by whom he was trusted had conspired against the life of Henry to whom he had sworn allegiance had betrayed his associates whom he had seduced into this enterprize and now displayed in the face of the world these badges of his multiplied dishonour  HENRY was sensible that tho' the execution of these conspirators might seem to give security to his throne the animosities which remain after such bloody scenes are always dangerous to royal authority and he therefore determined not to encrease by any hazardous enterprize those numerous enemies with whom he was every where surrounded While he was only a subject he was believed to have strongly imbibed all the principles of his father the duke of Lancaster and to have adopted the prejudices which the Lollards inspired against the abuses of the established church But finding himself possessed of the throne by so precarious a title he thought superstition a very necessary implement of public authority and he resolved by every expedient to pay court to the clergy There were hitherto no penal laws enacted against heresy an indulgence which had nowise proceeded from a spirit of toleration in the Romish church but from the ignorance and  simplicity of the people which had rendered them unfit either for starting or receiving any new or curious doctrines and which needed not to be restrained by any rigorous punishments But when the learning and genius of Wickliffe had once broke the fetters of prejudice the ecclesiastics called aloud for the punishment of his disciples and the King who was very little scrupulous in his conduct was easily induced to sacrifice his principles to his interest and to acquire the favour of the church by that most effectual method the gratifying their vengeance against all opponents He engaged the parliament to pass a law for this purpose and it was enacted that when any heretic who relapsed or refused to abjure his opinions was delivered over to the secular arm by the bishop or his commissaries he should be committed to the flames by the civil magistrate before the whole people  Hen IV chap  This weapon did not remain long unemployed in the hands of the clergy William Sautre rector of St Osithes in London had been condemned by the convocation of Canterbury his sentence was ratified by the house of peers the King issued his writ for the execution  Rymer vol p  and the unhappy man attoned for his erroneous opinions by the penalty of fire This is the first instance of that kind in England and thus one horror more was added to those dismal scenes which at that time were already but too familiar to the people  BUT the utmost precaution and prudence of Henry could not shield him from those numerous inquietudes which assailed him from every quarter The connexions of Richard with the royal family of France made that court exert its activity to recover his authority or revenge his death  Rymer vol p  but tho' the confusions of England tempted the French to undertake some enterprize by which they might distress their antient enemy the greater confusions which they experienced at home obliged them quickly to accommodate matters and Charles content with recovering his daughter from Henry's hands laid aside his preparations and renewed the truce between the two kingdoms  Rymer vol p  The attack of Guienne was also an inviting attempt which the present factions that prevailed among the French obliged them to neglect The Gascons affectionate to the memory of Richard who had been born among them refused to swear allegiance to a prince that had usurped his throne and murdered his person and the appearance of a French army on their frontiers would probably have tempted them to change masters  Rymer vol  But the earl of Worcester arriving with some English troops gave countenance to the partizans of England and overawed their opponents Religion too was here found a cement of their union with that kingdom The Gascons had been engaged by Richard's authority to acknowledge the Pope of Rome  and they were sensible that if they submitted to France it would be necessary for them to pay obedience to the Pope of Avignon whom they had been taught to detest as a schismatic Their principles on this head were too fast rooted to admit of any sudden or violent alteration  THE revolution in England proved likewise the occasion of an insurrection in Wales Owen Glendour or Glendourduy descended from the antient princes of that country had become obnoxious on account of his attachments to Richard and Reginald lord Gray of Ruthyn who was closely connected with the new King and who possessed a great fortune in the marches of Wales thought the opportunity favourable for oppressing his neighbour and taking possession of his estate  Vita  sec p  Glendour provoked at the injustice and still more at the indignity recovered possession by the sword  Walsing p  Henry sent assistance to Gray  Vita Ric sec  the Welsh took party with Glendour A troublesome and tedious war was kindled which Glendour long sustained by his valour and activity aided by the natural strength of that country and the untamed spirit of its inhabitants  As Glendour committed devastations promiscuously on all the English he infested the estate of the earl of Marche and sir Edmund Mortimer uncle to that nobleman led out the retainers of the family and gave battle to the Welsh chieftain His troops were routed and he himself was taken prisoner  vol p    At the same time the earl himself who had been allowed to retire to his castle of Wigmore and who tho' a mere boy took the field with his followers fell also into Glendour's hands and was carried by him into Wales  Dudgale vol p  As Henry hated mortally all the family of Marche he allowed the earl to remain in captivity and tho' that young nobleman was nearly allied to the Piercies to whose assistance he himself had owed his crown he refused to the earl of Northumberland permission to treat of his ransom with Glendour  THE uncertainty in which Henry's affairs stood for a long time with France as well as the confusion incident to all great changes in government tempted the Scots to make incursions into England and Henry desirous of taking revenge upon them but afraid of rendering his new government unpopular by requiring great supplies from his subjects summoned at Westminster a council of the peers without the commons and laid before them the state of his affairs  Rymer vol p  The military part of the feudal constitution was now entirely gone There remained only so much of that fabric as affected the civil rights and properties of men And the peers here  voluntarily  undertook to attend the King in an expedition against  Scotland each of them at the head of a certain number of his retainers  Rymer vol p  Henry conducted this army to Edinburgh of which he easily took possession and he there summoned Robert III to do homage to him for his crown  Rymer vol p c  But finding that the Scots would neither submit nor give him battle he returned in three weeks after making this useless bravado and he dispersed his army  IN the subsequent season Archibald earl of Douglas at the head of men and attended by many of the principal nobility made an irruption into England and committed devastations on the northern counties On his return home he was overtaken by the Piercies at Homeldon on the borders of England and a fierce battle ensued where the Scots were totally routed Douglas himself was taken prisoner as was Mordac earl of Fife son of the duke of Albany and nephew of the Scots King with the earls of Angus Murray and Orkney and many others of the Scots gentry and nobility  Walsing p Vita Ric sec p Chron Otterburne p  When Henry received intelligence of this victory he sent the earl of Northumberland orders not to ransom his prisoners which that nobleman regarded as his right by the laws of war that prevailed in that age The King intended to detain them that he might be able by their means to make an advantageous peace with Scotland but by this policy he gave a new cause of disgust to the family of Piercy  The earl of Northumberland rebels  THE obligations which Henry had owed to the earl of Northumberland were of a kind the most likely to produce ingratitude on the one side and discontent on the other The prince naturally became jealous of that power which had advanced him to the throne and the subject was not easily satisfied in the returns which he thought so great a favour had merited Tho' Henry on his accession had bestowed the office of constable on Northumberland for life  Rymer vol p  and conferred other gifts on that family these favours were regarded as their due the refusal of any other request was deemed an injury The impatient spirit of Harry Piercy and the factious disposition of the earl of Worcester younger brother of Northumberland inflamed the discontents of that nobleman and the precarious title of Henry tempted him to seek revenge by overturning that throne which he had at first established He entered into a correspondence with Glendour He gave liberty to the earl of Douglas and made an alliance with that martial chieftain He rouzed up all his partizans to arms and such unlimited authority at that time belonged to the great families that the same men whom a few years before he had conducted against Richard now followed his standard in opposition  to Henry When the war was ready to break out Northumberland was seized with a sudden illness at Berwic and young Piercy taking the command of the troops marched towards Shrewsbury in order to join his forces with those of Glendour The King had happily a small army on foot with which he had intended to act against the Scots and knowing the importance of celerity in all civil wars he instantly hurried down that he might give battle to the rebels He approached Piercy near Shrewsbury before that nobleman was joined by Glendour and the policy of the one leader and impatience of the other soon brought on a general engagement  THE evening before the battle Piercy sent a manifesto to Henry in which he renounced his allegiance set that prince at defiance and in the name of his father and uncle as well as his own enumerated all the grievances of which the nation had reason to complain He represented the perjury of which Henry had been guilty when on landing at Ravenspur he had sworn upon the gospels before the earl of Northumberland that he had no other intention but to recover possession of the dutchy of Lancaster and that he would ever remain a faithful subject to King Richard He aggravated his guilt in first dethroning and then murdering that prince and in usurping on the title of the house of Mortimer to whom both by lineal succession and by declarations of parliament the throne when vacant by Richard's death did of right belong He complained of the cruel policy in allowing the young earl of Marche whom he ought to regard as his sovereign to remain a captive in the hands of his enemies and in even refusing to all his friends permission to treat of his ransom He charged him again with perjury in loading the nation with heavy taxes after having sworn that without the utmost necessity he would neverlevy any impositions upon them And he reproached him with the arts employed in procuring favourable elections into parliament arts which he himself had before imputed to Richard and which he had made one chief reason of that prince's arraignment and deposition  Hall fol c  This manifesto was very well calculated to inflame the quarrel between the parties The bravery of the two leaders promised an obstinate engagement And the equality of the armies being each about men a number which rendered them not unmanageable by the commanders gave reason to expect a great effusion of blood on both sides and a very doubtful issue to the combat  st July Battle of Shrewsbury  WE shall scarcely find any battle in those ages where the shock was more terrible and more constant Henry exposed his person in the thickest of the fight His gallant son whose military feats became afterwards so famous and who here performed his apprenticeship in arms signalized himself on his father's footsteps  and even an wound which he received on the face with an arrow could not oblige him to quit the field  T Livii p  Piercy supported that renown which he had acquired in so many bloody combats And Douglas his antient enemy and now his friend still appeared his rival amidst the horror and confusion of the day This nobleman performed acts of valour which are almost incredible He seemed determined that the King of England should fall that day by his arm He sought him all over the field of battle And as Henry either to elude the attacks of the enemy upon his person or to encourage his own men by the belief of his presence every where had accoutered several captains in the royal garb the sword of Douglas rendered this honour fatal to many  Walsingham p Hall fol  But while the armies were contending in this furious manner the death of Piercy by an uncertain hand decided the victory and the royalists prevailed There are said to have fallen that day on both sides near two thousand three hundred gentlemen but the persons of greatest distinction were on the King's the earl of Stafford Sir Hugh Shirley Sir Nicholas Gausel Sir Hugh Mortimer Sir John Massey Sir John Calverley About six thousand private men perished of whom two thirds were of Piercy's army  Chron Otterb p Ypod Neust p  The earls of Worcester and Douglas were taken prisoners The former was beheaded at Shrewsbury the latter was treated with the courtesy which was due to his rank and merit  THE earl of Northumberland having recovered his health had levyed an army and was on his march to join his son but being opposed by the earl of Westmoreland and hearing of the event of the battle at Shrewsbury he dismissed his forces and came with a small retinue to the King at York  Otterbourne p  He pretended that his sole intention in arming was to mediate between the two parties Henry thought proper to accept the apology and even granted him a pardon for his offence All the other rebels were treated with equal lenity and except the earl of Worcester and Sir Richard Vernon who were regarded as the chief authors of the insurrection no person engaged in this dangerous design seems to have perished by the hands of the executioner  Rymer vol p    BUT Northumberland tho' he had been pardoned knew that he never should be trusted and that he was too powerful to be cordially forgiven by a prince whose situation gave him such reasonable grounds of jealousy It was the effect either of Henry's vigilance or good fortune or of the narrow genius of his enemies that no proper concert was ever formed among them They rose in rebellion one after another and thereby afforded him an opportunity of suppressing  singly th  se insurrections which had they been united might have proved fatal to his throne The earl of Nottingham son to the duke of Norfolk and the archbishop of York brother to the earl of Wiltshire whom Henry then duke of Lancaster had beheaded at Bristol tho' they had remained quiet while Piercy was in the field still harboured in their breast a violent hatred against the enemy of their families and they determined in conjunction with the earl of Northumberland to seek revenge against him They betook themselves to arms before that powerful nobleman was prepared to join them and publishing a manifesto in which they reproached Henry with his usurpation of the crown and the murder of the late King they required that the right line should be restored and all public grievances be redressed The earl of Westmoreland whose power lay in the neighbourhood approached them with an inferior force at Shipton near York and being afraid to hazard a battle he attempted to subdue them by an artifice which nothing but the greatest solly and simplicity on their part could have rendered successful He desired a conference with the archbishop and earl between the two armies He heard their grievances with great patience He begged them to propose the remedies He approved of every thing which they suggested He granted them all their demands He also engaged that Henry should give them entire satisfaction And when he saw them pleased with the facility of his concessions he observed to them that since amity was now in effect restored between them it were better on both sides to dismiss their forces which otherwise would prove an insupportable burthen to the country The archbishop and the earl of Nottingham immediately issued orders to that purpose Their troops disbanded upon the field But Westmoreland who had secretly issued contrary orders to  his  army seized the two rebels without resistance and carried them to the King who was advancing with hasty marches to suppress the rebellion  Walsingham p Otterbourne p  The trial and punishment of an archbishop might have proved a very troublesome and dangerous undertaking had Henry proceeded regularly and allowed time for an opposition to form itself against that unusual measure The celerity of the execution alone could here render it safe and prudent Finding that Sir William Gascoigne the chief justice made some scruple of acting on this occasion he appointed Sir William Fulthorpe a judge for that purpose who without any indictment trial or defence pronounced sentence of death upon the prelate which was instantly executed This was the first instance in England of a capital punishment inflicted on a bishop whence the clergy of that rank might learn that their crimes as well as those of Laics were not to pass with impunity  The earl of Nottingham was condemned and executed in the same summary manner But tho' many other persons of condition such as the lord Falconberge Sir Ralph Hastings Sir John Colville were engaged in this rebellion no more seem to have fallen victims to Henry's severity  THE earl of Northumberland on receiving this intelligence fled into Scotland together with lord Bardolf  Walsingham p  and the King without opposition reduced all the castles and fortresses belonging to these noblemen He thence turned his arms against Glendour over whom his son the prince of Wales had obtained some advantages But that enemy more troublesome than dangerous still found means of defending himself in his fastnesses and of eluding tho' not resisting all the force of England  In a subsequent season the earl of Northumberland and lord Bardolf impatient of their exile entered the north in hopes of raising the people to arms but found the country in such a posture as rendered all their attempts unsuccessful Sir Thomas Rokesby sheriff of Yorkshire levied some forces attacked the invaders at Bramham and gained a victory in which both Northumberland and Bardolf were slain  Walsingham p Chron Otterb p  This prosperous event joined to the death of Glendour which happened soon after freed Henry from all his domestic enemies and this prince who had mounted the throne by such unjustifiable methods and held it by such an exceptionable title had yet by his valour prudence and address accustomed his people to the yoke and had obtained a greater ascendant over his haughty barons than the law alone not supported by these active qualities was ever able to confer  ABOUT the same time fortune gave Henry an advantage over that neighbour who by his situation was best enabled to disturb his government Robert the third King of Scots was a prince tho' of slender capacity extremely innocent and inoffensive in his conduct But Scotland still less than England was at that time fitted for cherishing or even enduring sovereigns of that character The duke of Albany Robert's brother a prince of more abilities at least of a more boisterous and violent disposition had assumed the government of the state and not satisfied with present authority he entertained the criminal purpose of extirpating his brother's children and of acquiring the crown to his own family He threw in prison David his eldest nephew who there perished with hunger James alone the younger brother of David stood between that tyrant and the throne and King Robert sensible of his son's danger embarked him on board a ship with a view of sending him into France and entrusting him to the protection of that friendly power Unfortunately the vessel was taken by the English prince James a boy about nine years of age was carried to London  and tho' there subsisted a truce at that time between the two kingdoms Henry con+stantly refused to restore the young prince to his liberty Robert worn out with cites and infirmities was unable to bear the shock of this last misfortune and he soon after died leaving the government in the hands of the duke of Albany  Henry was now more sensible than ever of the importance of the acquisition which he had made While he retained such a pledge in his hands he was sure of keeping the duke of Albany in dependance or if offended he could easily by restoring the true heir take ample revenge upon the usurper But tho' the King by detaining James in the English court had shown himself somewhat deficient in generosity he made ample amends by giving that prince an excellent education which afterwards qualified him when he mounted the throne to reform in some measure the rude and barbarous manners of his native country  THE hostile dispositions which always prevailed between France and England were restrained during the greatest part of this reign from appearing in action The jealousies and civil commotions with which both nations was disturbed kept each of them from taking advantage of the unhappy situation of its neighbour But as the abilities and good fortune of Henry had been able sooner to compose the English factions this prince began in the latter part of his reign to look abroad and to foment the animosities between the families of Burgundy and Orleans by which the government of France was during that period so much distracted He knew that one great source of the national discontent against his predecessor was the inactivity of his reign and he hoped by giving a new direction to the restless and unquiet spirits of his people to prevent their breaking out in domestic wars and disorders  That he might join policy to force he first entered into treaty with the duke of Burgundy and sent that prince a small body of troops which supported him against his enemies  Walsingham p  Soon after he hearkened to more advantageous proposals made him by the duke of Orleans and dispatched a greater body to support that party  Rymer vol p    But the leaders of the opposite factions having made a temporary accommodation of their differences the interests or the English were sacrificed and this effort of Henry proved in the issue entirely vain and fruitless The declining state of his health and the shortness of his reign prevented him from renewing the attempt which his more fortunate son carried to so great a length against the French monarchy  SUCH were the military and foreign transactions of this reign The civil and parliamentary are somewhat more memorable and more worthy of our attention During the two last reigns the elections of the commons had appeared a circumstance of government not to be neglected and Richard was even accused of using  unwarrantable methods for procuring to his partizans a seat in that house This practice formed one considerable article of charge against him in his deposition yet Henry scrupled not to tread in his footsteps and to encourage the same abuses in elections Laws were enacted against such undue influence and even a sheriff was punished for an iniquitous return which he had made  Cotton p    But laws commonly were at that time very ill executed and the liberties of the people such as they were stood on a surer basis than on laws and parliamentary elections Tho' the house of commons was little able to withstand the violent currents which perpetually ran between the monarchy and the aristocracy and that house might easily be brought at a particular time to make the most unwarrantable concessions to either the general institutions of the state still remained invariable the interests of the several members continued on the same footing the sword was in the hands of the subject and the government tho' thrown into temporary disorders soon settled itself on its antient foundations  DURING the greatest part of this reign the King was obliged to court popularity and the house of commons sensible of their own importance began to assume powers which had not usually been exercised by their predecessors In the first session of this reign they procured a law that no judge in concurring with any iniquitous measure should be excused by pleading the orders of the King or even the danger of his own life from the menaces of the sovereign  Cotton p  In the second year of Henry they insisted on maintaining the practice of not granting any supply before they received an answer to their petitions which was a tacit method of bargaining with the prince  Cotton p    In the fifth year they desired the King to remove from his household four officers who had displeased them among whom was his own confessor and Henry tho' he told them that he knew of no offence which these persons had committed yet in order to gratify them complied with their request  p    In the sixth year they voted the King supplies but appointed treasurers of their own to see the money disbursed for the purposes intended and required them to deliver in their accounts to the house  Cotton p  In the eighth year they proposed thirty very important articles for the regulation of the government and household which were all granted them and they even obliged all the members of council all the judges and all the officers of the household to swear to the observance of them  Cotton p    The abridger of the records observes the unusual liberties taken by the speaker and the house during this period  Cotton p  But the great authority of the commons was but a temporary advantage arising from the present situation In a subsequent parliament when the speaker made  his customary applications to the throne for liberty of speech the King having now overcome all his domestic difficulties plainly told him that he would have no novelties introduced and would enjoy his prerogatives But on the whole the limitations of the government seem to have been more sensibly felt and more carefully maintained by Henry than by any of his predecessors  DURING this reign when the house of commons were at any time brought to make unwary concessions to the crown they also showed their freedom by a very speedy retractation of them Henry tho' he entertained a perpetual and wellgrounded jealousy of the family of Mortimer allowed not their name to be once mentioned in parliament and as none of the rebels had ventured to declare the earl of Marche King he never attempted to procure what would not have been refused him an express declaration against the claim of that nobleman because he knew that such a declaration in the present circumstances would have no authority and would only serve to revive the memory of Mortimer's title in the minds of the people He proceeded in his purpose after a more artful and covert manner He procured a settlement of the crown on himself and his heirsma e  Cotton p  thereby tacitely excluding the females and transferring the Salic law to the English government He thought that tho' the house of Plantagenet had at first derived their title from females this was a remote event unknown to the genera ity of the people and if he could once accustom the nation to the practice of excluding women the title of the earl of Marche would gradually be forgot and neglected by them But he was very unfortunate in this attempt During the long contests with France the injustice of the Salic law had been so much exclaimed against by the nation that a contrary principle had taken deep root in the minds of men and it was now become impossible to eradicate it The same house of commons therefore in a subsequent session apprehensive that they had overturned the foundations of the English government and that they had opened the door to more civil wars than might ensue even from the irregular advancement of the house of Lancaster applied with such earnestness for a new settlement of the crown that Henry yielded to their request and agreed to the succession of the princesses of his family  Rymer vol p  A certain proof that nobody was in his heart satisfied with the King's title to the crown or knew on what principle to rest it  BUT tho' the commons during this reign showed a very laudable zeal for liberty in their transactions with the crown their efforts against the church were still more extraordinary and seemed to anticipate very much on the spirit which became so general in little more than a century afterwards I know that the credit  of these passages rests entirely on one antient historian  Walsingham  but that historian was contemporary was a churchman and it was contrary to the interests of his order to preserve the memory of such transactions much more to forge precedents which posterity might some time be tempted to imitate This is a truth so evident that the most likely way of accounting for the silence of the records on this head is by supposing that the authority of some churchmen was so great as to procure a razure with regard to these circumstances which the indiscretion of one of that order has happily preserved to us  IN the sixth of Henry the commons who had been required to grant supplies proposed in plain terms to the King that he should seize all the temporalities of the church and employ them as a perpetual fund to serve the exigencies of the state They insisted that the clergy possessed a third of the lands of the kingdom that they contributed nothing to the support of the public burdens and that their exorbitant riches tended only to disqualify them for performing their ministerial functions with proper zeal and attention When this address was presented the archbishop of Canterbury who then attended the King objected that the clergy tho' they went not in person to the wars sent their vassals and tenants in all cases of necessity while at the same time they themselves who staid at home were employed night and day in offering up their prayers for the happiness and prosperity of the state The speaker smiled and replied without reserve that he thought the prayers of the church but a very slender supply The archbishop however prevailed in the dispute The Ki g discouraged the application of the commons And the lords rejected the bill which the lower house had framed for despoiling the church of her revenues  Walsingham p Ypod Neust p    THE commons were not discouraged by this repulse In the eleventh of the King they returned to the charge with more zeal than before They made a calculation of all the ecclesiastical revenues which by their account amounted to marks a year and included ploughs of land They proposed to divide this riches among fifteen new earls knights esquires and a hundred hospitals besides pounds ayear which the King might take for his own use And they insisted that the clerical functions would be better performed than at present by parish priests at the rate of seven marks a piece of yearly stipend  Walsingham p Tit Livius  This application was accompanied with an address for mitigating the statutes enacted against the Lollards which shows from what source the address came The King gave the commons a severe reply and  farther to satisfy the church and to prove that he was quite in earnest he ordered a Lollard to be burned before the dissolution of the parliament  Rymer vol p Otterbourne p    WE have now related almost all the memorable transactions of this reign which was busy and active but produced few events that deserve to be transmitted to posterity The King was so much employed in defending his crown which he had obtained by such unwarrantable means and possessed by so bad a title that he had little leisure to look abroad or perform any actions which might redound to the honour or advantage of the nation His health declined visibly some months before his death He was subject to fits which bereaved him for the time of his senses And tho' he was yet in the flower of his age his end was visibly approaching  th March Death  He expired at Westminster in the fortysixth year of his age and the thirteenth of his reign  and character of the King  THE great popularity which Henry enjoyed before he attained the crown and which had so much aided him in the acquisition of it was entirely lost many years before the end of his reign and he governed his people more by terror than by affection more by his own policy than by their sense of duty or allegiance When men came to reflect in cool blood on the crimes which had led him to the throne the rebellion against his prince the deposition of a lawful King guilty sometimes perhaps of oppression but more frequently of imprudences the exclusion of the true heir the murder of his sovereign and near relation these were such enormities as drew on him the hatred of his subjects sanctified all the rebellions against him and made the executions tho' not remarkably severe which he found necessary for the maintenance of his authority appear cruel as well as iniquitous to the people Yet without pretending to apologize for these crimes which must ever be held in detestation it may be remarked that he was insensibly led into this blameable conduct by a train of incidents which few men possess virtue enough to withstand The injustice with which his predecessor had treated him in first condemning him to banishment and then despoiling him of his patrimony made him naturally think of revenge and of recovering his lost rights the headlong zeal of the people hurried him into the throne the care of his own security as well as his ambition made him an usurper and the steps have always been so few between the prisons of princes and their graves that we need not wonder if Richard's fate was no exception to the general rule All these considerations make Henry's situation if he retained any sense of virtue very much to be lamented and the inquietude with which he possessed his envied greatness and the remorses by which it is said he was continually haunted render him  an object of our pity even when seated upon the throne But it must be owned that his prudence and vigilance and foresight in maintaining his power were admirable His command of temper remarkable His courage both military and political without b  mish And he possessed many qualities which fitted him for his high slation and which rendered his usurpation of it tho' pernicious in after times rather salutary during his own reign to the English nation  HENRY was twice married By his first wife Mary de Bohun daughter and heir of the earl of Hereford he had four sons Henry his successor in the throne Thomas duke of Clarence John duke of Bedford and Humphrey duke of Glocester and two daughters Blanche and Philippa the former married to the duke of Bavaria the latter to the King of Denmark His second wife Jane whom he married after he was King and who was daughter to the King of Navarre and widow of the duke of Brittany brought him no issue  CHAP XIX HENRY V  The King's former disordersHis

TroyeMarriage of the KingHis deathAnd characterMiscellaneous transactions during this reign  The King's former disorders  THE many jealousies to which Henry IV's situation naturally exposed him had so infected his temper that he had been persuaded to entertain unreasonable suspicions with regard to the fidelity of his eldest son and during the latter years of his life he had excluded that prince from all share in public business and was even displeased to see him at the head of armies where his martial talents tho' useful to the support of government acquired him a renown which he thought might prove dangerous to his own authority The active spirit of young Henry restrained from its proper exercise broke out in extravagancies of every kind and the riot of pleasure the frolics of debauchery the outrage of wine filled the vacancies of a mind better adapted to the pursuits of ambition and the cares of government This course of life threw him among companions whose disorders if accompanied with spirit and humour he seconded and indulged and he was detected in many sallies which to severer eyes appeared totally unworthy of his rank and station There even remains a tradition that when heated with liquor and jollity he scrupled not to accompany them in attacking the passengers on the streets and highways and despoiling them of their goods and he found an amusement in the incidents which the terror and regret of these defenceless people produced on such occasions This extreme of dissoluteness proved equally dis greeable to his father as that eager application to busi  ess which had at first given him occasion of jealousy and he saw in his son's behaviour the same nr  lect of decency the same attachm  nt to low company whi  h  de  royed the  ersonal character of Richard and which more than all his errors in government had tended to overturn his throne But the nation in  general considered the young prince with more indulgence and observ d so many gleams of generosity spirit and magnanimity breaking continually thro' the cloud which a wild conduct threw over his character that they never ceased hoping for his amendment and ascribed all the weeds which shot up in that rich soil to the want of proper culture and attention in the King and his ministers There passed an event which encouraged these agreeable views and gave much occasion for favourable reflexions to all men of sense and candor A riotous companion of the prince's had been indicted before Gascoigne the chief justice for some disorders and Henry was not ashamed to appear at the bar with the criminal in order to give him countenance and protection Finding that his presence had not overawed the chief justice he proceeded to insult that magistrate on his tribunal but Gascoigne mindful of the character which he then bore and the majesty of the sovereign and of the laws which he sustained ordered the prince to be carried to prison for his rude behaviour  Hall fol  The spectators were agreeably disappointed when they saw the heir of the crown submit peaceably to this sentence make reparation for his error by acknowledging it and check his impetuous nature in the midst of its extravagant career  His reformation  THE memory of this incident and of many others of a like nature rendered the prospect of the future reign no w se disagreeable to the nation and encreased the joy which the death of so unpopular a prince as his father naturally occasioned The first steps taken by the young King confirmed all those prepossessions entertained in his favour  Walsing p  He called together his former companions acquainted them with his intended information exhorted them to imitate his example but strictly inhibited them till they had given proofs of their sincerity in this particular to appear any more in his presence and he thus dismissed them with liberal presents  Hall fol Hollingshed p Goodwin's Life of Henry V p  The wise ministers of his father who had checked his riots found that they had unknowingly been paying the highest court to him and were received with all the marks of favour and confidence The chief justice himself who trembled to approach the royal presence met with praises instead of reproaches for his past conduct and was exhorted to persevere in the same rigorous and imp rtial execution of the laws The surprize of those who expected an opposite behaviour augmented their satisfaction and the character of the young King appeared brighter than if it had never been shaded by any errors  BUT Henry was anxious not only to repair his own misconduct but also to make amends for those iniquities into which policy or the necessity or affairs had betrayed his father He expressed the deepest sorrow for the fate of the unhappy  Richard did justice to the memory of that unfortunate prince even performed anew his funeral obsequies with pomp and solemnity and cherished all those who had distinguished themselves by their loyalty and attachment towards him  Hist Croyland contin Hall fol Holingshed p  Instead of continuing the restraints which the jealousy of his father had imposed on the ear  of Marche he received that young nobleman with singular courtesy and favour and by this magnanimity so gained on the gentle and unambitious nature of his rival that he remained ever after sincerely attached to him and gave him no d  sturbance in his future government The family of Piercy was restored to it fortune and honours  Holingshed p  The King seemed ambitious to bury all party distinctions in oblivion The instruments of the preceding reign who had been advanced from their blind zeal for the Lancastrian interest more than from their merits gave place every where to men of more honourable characters Virtue seemed now to have an open career in which it might exert itse f The exhortations as well as example of the prince gave it encouragement All men were unanimous in their attachment to Henry and the defects of his title were forgot amidst the personal regard which was universally paid to him  The Lollards  THERE remained among the people only one party distinction which was derived from religious differences and which as it is of a peculiar and commonly a very obstinate nature the popularity of Henry was not able to overcome The Lollards were every day encreasing in the kingdom and were become a formed party which appeared extremely dangerous to the church and even formidable to the civil authority  Walsingham p  The enthusiasm by which these sectaries were generally actuated the great alterations which they pretended to introduce the hatred which they expressed against the established hierarchy gave an alarm to Henry who either from a sincere attachment to the antient religion or from the dread of the unknown consequences which attend all important changes was determined to execute the laws against such bold innovators The head of this sect was Sir John Oldcastle lord Cobham a nobleman who had distinguished himself by his valour and his military talents and had on many occasions acquired the esteem both of the late and of the present King  Walsingham p  His high character and his zeal for the new sect pointed him out to Arundel Archbishop of Canterbury as the proper victim of ecclesiastical severity whose punishment would strike a terror into the whole party and teach them that they must expect no mercy under the present administration He applied to Henry for a permission to indict lord Cobham  Fox's Acts and Monuments p    but the generous nature of that prince was averse to such sanguinary methods of conversion He represented to the primate that reason and conviction were the best expedients for supporting truth that every gentle means ought first to be tried in order to reclaim men from error and that he himself would endeavour by a conversation with Cobham to reconcile him to the Catholic faith But he found that nobleman obstinate in his opinions and determined not to sacrifice truths of such infinite moment to his complaisance for sovereigns  Rymer vol p Walsingham p  Henry's principles of toleration or rather his love of the practice could carry him no farther and he then gave full reins to ecclesiastical severity against this inflexible heresiarch The primate indicted Cobham and with the assistance of his three suffragans the bishops of London Winchester and St David's condemned him to the flames for his erroneous opinions Cobham who was confined to the Tower made his escape before the day of his execution The bold spirit of this man provoked by persecution and stimulated by zeal was urged to attempt the most criminal enterprizes and his unlimited authority over the sect proved that he well merited the attention of the civil magistrate He formed in his retreat very violent designs against his enemies and dispatching his emissaries to all quarters appointed a general rendezvous of the party in order to seize the person of the King at Eltham and put their persecutors to the sword  Walsingham p  Henry apprized of their intention removed to Westminster  th January  Cobham was not discouraged by this disappointment but changed the place of rendezvous to the fields near St Giles The King having shut the gates of the city to prevent any conjunction from that quarter came into the fields in the nighttime seized such of the conspirators as appeared and afterwards laid hold of the several parties who were hastening to the place appointed It appeared that few were in the secret of the conspiracy The rest implicitely followed their leaders But upon the trial of the prisoners the treasonable designs of the sect were rendered certain both from evidence and from the confession of the criminals themselves  Cotton p Hall fol Holingshed p  Some were executed the greater number pardoned  Rymer vol p    Punishment of lord Cobham  Cobham himself who made his escape by flight was not brought to justice till four years after when he was hanged as a traitor and his body was burnt on the gibbet in execution of the sentence pronounced against him as a heretic  Walsingham p Otterbourne p Hollingshed p  This criminal design which was perhaps somewhat aggravated by the clergy brought discredit upon the party and checked the progress of that sect which had embraced the speculative doctrines of Wickliffe and at the same time aspired to a reformation of ecclesiastical abuses  THESE two points were the great objects of the Lollards but the generality of the nation was not affected in the same degree by both of them Common sense and obviousreflection had discovered to the people the advantages of a reformation in discipline but the age was not yet so far advanted as to be seized with the spirit of controversy or to enter into those abstruse do strines which the Lollards endeavoured to propagate throughout the kingdom The very notion of heresy alarmed the genera ity of the people Innovation in fundamental principles was suspicious Curiosity was not as yet a proper counterballance to authority And even many who were the greatest friends to the reformation of abuses were anxious to ex ress their detestation of the speculative tenets of the Wicliffites which they feared threw disgrace on so good a cause This turn of thought appears evidently in the proceedings of the parliament which was summoned immediately after the detection of Cobham's conspiracy That assembly passed severe laws against the new heretics They enacted that whoever was convicted of Lollardy bef  re the Ordinary besides suffering capital pnnishment according to the laws formerly established should also forfeit his lands and goods to the King and that the chancellor treasurer justices of the two benches sheriffs justices of peace and all the chief magistrates in every city and borough should take an oath to use their utmost endeav urs for the extirpation of heresy  Hen V chap  Yet this very parliament when the King demanded supply renewed the offer formerly pressed upon h s father and entreated him to seize all the ecclesiastical revenues and convert them to the use of the crown  Hall fol  The clergy were alarmed They could offer the King no bribe which was equivalent They only agreed to confer on him all the priories alien which depended on capital abbies in Normandy and had been bequeathed them when that province remained united to England And Chicheley now archbish p of Canterbury endeavoured to divert the blow by giving occupation to the King and by persuading him to undertake a war against France in order to recover his lost rights to that kingdom  Hall fol    IT was the dying injunction of the late King to his son not to allow the English to remain long in peace which was apt to breed intestine commotions but to employ them in foreign expeditions by which the prince might acquire honour the nobil  ty in sharing his dangers might attach themselves to his person and all the restless spirits find occupation for their inquietude The natural disposition of Henry sufficiently inclined him to follow this advice and the civil disorders of France which had been lengtheaed out beyond those of England opened a full career to his ambition  State of France  THE death of Charles V which followed so soon after that of Edward III and the youth of his son Charles VI put the two kingdoms for some time in a similar situation and it was not to be apprehended that either of them during a minority would be able to make much advantage of the weakness of the other The jealousies also between Charles's three uncles the dukes of Anjou Berri and Burgundy had distracted the affairs of France rather more than those between the dukes of Lancaster York and Glocester Richard's three uncles disordered those of England and had carried off the attention of the French nation from any vigorous enterprize against foreigners But in proportion as Charles advanced in years the factions were composed his two uncles the dukes of Anjou and Burgundy died and the King himself assuming the government gave symptoms of genius and spirit which revived the drooping hopes of his country This promising state of affairs was not of long continuance The unhappy prince fell suddenly into a fit of frenzy which rendered him incapable of exercising his authority and tho' he recovered from this disorder he was so subject to relapses that his judgment was gradually but sensibly impaired and no steddy plan of government could be pursued by him The administration of affairs was disputed between his brother Lewis duke of Orleans and his cousin german John duke of Burgundy The propinquity to the crown pleaded in favour of the former The latter who in right of his mother had inherited the county of Flanders which he annexed to his father's extensive dominions derived a lustre from his superior power The people were divided between these contending princes And the King now resuming and now dropping his authority kept the victory undecided and prevented any regular settlement of the state by the final prevalence of either party  AT length the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy seeming to be moved by the cries of the nation and by the interposition of common friends agreed to bury all past quarrels in oblivion and to enter into strict amity together They swore before the altar to the sincerity of this friendship the priest administered the sacrament to both of them they gave to each other every pledge which could be deemed sacred among men But all this solemn preparation was only a cover for the basest treachery which was deliberately meditated by the duke of Burgundy He made his rival be assassinated in the streets of Paris He endeavoured for some time to conceal the part which he took in the crime But being detected he embraced a resolution still more criminal and more dangerous to society by openly avowing and justifying it  La Laboureur liv chap  The parliament of Paris itself the tribunal of justice heard the harangues of the duke's advocate in defence of assassination  which he denominated tyrannicide and that assembly partly influented be faction partly overawed by power pronounced no sentence of condemnation against this detestable doctrine  Le Laboureur liv chap Monstrelet chap  The same question was afterwards agit  d before the council of Constance and it was with difficulty that a feeble dec  sion in favour of the contrary opinion was procured from these fathers of the church the ministers of peace and of religion But the mischievous effects of that tenet had they been before any wise doubtful appeared sufficiently from the present incidents The commission of this crime which destroyed all trust and security rendered the war implacable between the French parties and cut off every means of peace and accommodation The princes of the blood conspiring with the young duke of Orleans and his brothers made violent war on the duke of Burgundy and the unhappy King seized sometimes by one party sometimes by another transferred alternately to each of them the appearance of legal authority The provinces were laid waste by mutual depredations Assassinations were every where committed from the animosity of the several leaders or what was equally terrible executions were ordered without any legal or free trial by pretended courts of judicature The whole kingdom was distinguished into two parties the Burgundians and the Armagnacs so the adherents of the young duke of Orleans were called from the count of Armagnac fatherin law to that prince The city of Paris distracted between them but inclining more to the Burgundians was a perpetual scene of blood and violence the King and royal family were often detained captives in the hands of the populace their faithful ministers were butchered or imprisoned before their face and it was dangerous for any man amidst these enraged factions to be distinguished by a strict adherence to the principles of probity and honour  DURING this scene of general violence there rose into some consideration a b  y of men which usually makes no figure in public transactions even in the most pe  ceful t  mes and that was the university of Paris whose opinions were sometimes required and more frequently offered in the multiplied disputes between the parties The schism by which the church was at that time div  ded and which occasioned frequent controversies in the university had raised the masters to an unusual degree of importance and this connexion between  and superstition had bestowed on the former a weight to which reason and  are not of themselves any wise intitled among men But there was  sentiments were much more decisive at Paris the frat  who under the direction of their ringleaders had declared for the  uke of Burgundy and committee the most violent outrages against the  opposite party To counterballance their power the Armagnacs made interest with the fraternity of carpenters the populace ranged themselves on the one side or the other and the fate of the capital depended on the prevalence of either party  THE advantage which might be made of these confusions was easily perceived in England and according to the maxims which usually prevail among nations it was determined to lay hold of the favourable opportunity The late King who was courted by both the French parties fomented the quarrel by alternately sending assistance to both but the present sovereign impelled by the vigor of youth and the ardor of ambition determined to push his advantages to a greater length and to carry a violent war into that distracted kingdom But while he was making preparations for that purpose he tried to effectuate his purpose by negotiation and he sent over ambassadors to Paris offering a perpetual peace and alliance but demanding Catharine the French King's daughter in marriage two millions of crowns as her portion the payment of one million six hundred thousand as the arrears of King John's ransom and the immediate possession and full sovereignty of Normandy and of all the other provinces which had been ravished from England by the arms of Philip Augustus together with the superiority of Brittany and Flanders  Rymer vol p  Such exorbitant demands showed that he was sensible of the present miserable condition of France and the terms offered by the French court tho' much inferior discovered their consciousness of the same melancholy truth They were willing to give him the princess in marriage to pay him eight hundred thousand crowns to resign the entire sovereignty of Guienne and to annex to that province the country of Perigord Rovergue Xaintonge the Angoumois and other territories  Rymer vol p It is reported by some historians see Hist Croyl Cont p that the Dauphin in derision of Henry's claims and dissolute character sent him a box of tennis balls intimating that these implements of play were better adapted to him than the instruments of war But this story is by no means credible the great concessions made by the court of France show that they had already entertained a just idea of Henry's character as well as of their own situation  As Henry was not willing to accept of these conditions and scarce expected that his own demands would be complied with he never interrupted a moment his preparations for war and having assembled a great fleet and army at Southampton having invited all the nobility and military men of the kingdom to attend him by the hopes of glory and of conquest he came to the seaside with a purpose of embarking on his expedition  BUT while Henry was meditating conquests upon his neighbours he unexpectedly found himself in danger from a conspiracy at home which was happily detected in its infan  y The earl of Cambridge second son of the late duke of York having espoused the sister of the earl of Marche had zealously embraced the interests of that family and had held some conferences with the lord Scrope of Masham and Sir Thomas Gray of Heton about the means of recovering to that nobleman his just right to the crown of England The conspirators so soon as they were detected acknowledged their guilt to the King  Rymer vol p T Livii p  and Henry proceeded without delay to their trial and condemnation The utmost that could be expected of the best King in those ages was that he would so far observe the essentials of justice as not to make an innocent person a victim to his severity But as to the formalities of law which are often as material as the essentials themselves they were sacrificed without scruple to the least interest or convenience A jury of commoners was summoned The three conspirators was indicted before them The constable of Southampton castle swore that they had separately confessed their guilt to him Without other evidence Sir Thomas Gray was condemned and executed But as the earl of Cambridge and lord Scrope pleaded the privilege of their peerage Henry thought proper to summon a court of eighteen barons in which the duke of Clarence presided The evidence given before the jury was read to them The prisoners tho' one of them was a prince of the blood were not examined nor produced in court nor heard in their own defence but received sentence of death upon this proof which was every way irregular and illegal and the sentence was soon after executed The earl of Marche was accused of having given his approbation to this conspiracy and received a general pardon from the King  Rymer vol p  He was probably either innocent of the crime imputed to him or had made reparation by his early repentance and discovery  St Remi chap Godwin p      Invasion of France  THE successes which the arms of England have in different ages obtained over those of France have been much owing to the favourable situation of the former kingdom The English happily seated in an island could make advantage of every misfortune which attended their neighbours and were little exposed to the danger of retaliation They never left their own country but when conducted by a King of extraordinary genius or found their enemy divided by intestine factions or were supported by a powerful alliance on the continent and as all these circumstances concurred at present to favour their enterprize they had reason to expect from it a proportionable success The duke of Burgundy  expelled France by a combination of the princes had been secretly solliciting the alliance of England  Rymer vol p  and Henry knew that that prince tho' he scrupled at first to join the inveterate enemy of his country would willingly if he saw any probability of success both assist him with his Flemish subjects and draw over to the same cause all his numerous partizans in France Trusting therefore to this circumstance but without establishing any concert with the duke he put to sea and landed near Harfleur at the head of an army of men at arms and foot mostly archers  th August  He immediately began the siege of that place which was valiantly defended by the lords d'Estoûteville de Guitri de Gaucourt and others of the French nobility But as the garrison was weak and the fortifications in bad repair they were at last obliged to capitulate and they promised to surrender if they received no succour before the eighteenth of September The day came and there was no appearance of a French army to relieve them Yet they still delayed on various pretences to open their gates till Henry incensed at their breach of faith ordered a general assault took the town by storm and put all the garrison to the sword except some gentlemen whom the victorious army in hopes of reaping profit by their ransom were induced to spare  Le Laboureur liv chap    THE fatigues of this siege and the unusual heat of the season had so wasted the English army that Henry could enter on no farther enterprize and was obliged to think of returning into England He had dismissed his transports which could not safely anchor in an open road upon the enemy's coast and he lay under a necessity of marching by land to Calais before he could reach a place of safety A numerous French army of men at arms and foot was by this time assembled in Normandy under the constable d'Albert a force which if prudently conducted was sufficient either to trample down the English in the open field or to harass and reduce to nothing their small army before they could finish so long and difficult a march Henry therefore very cautiously offered to sacrifice his conquest of Harfleur for a safe passage to Calais but his proposal being rejected by the French court he determined to force his way by valor and policy thro' all the opposition of the enemy  T Livii p  That he might not discourage his own army by the appearance of flight or expose them to those hazards which naturally attend precipitate marches he made very slow and deliberate journies  Laboureur liv chap  till he reached the Somme which he proposed to pass at the ford of Blanquetague the same place where Edward in a like situation had  before escaped from Philip de Valois But he found the ford rendered impassable by the precaution of the French general and guarded by a strong body on the opposite bank  Remi chap    and he was therefore obliged to march higher up the river in order to seek for a safe passage He was continually harrassed on his march by flying parties of the enemy saw bodies of troops on the other side ready to oppose every attempt his provisions were cut off his soldiers languished with sickness and fatigue and his affairs seemed to be reduced to a desperate situation When he was so dexterous or so fortunate as to seize by surprize a passage near St Quintin which had not been sufficiently guarded and he safely carried over his army  T Livii p      Battle of Azincour  HENRY then bent his march northwards to Calais but he was still exposed to great and imminent danger from the enemy who had also passed the Somme and threw themselves full in his way with a purpose of intercepting his retreat  th Octr  After he had passed the small river of Ternois at Blangi he was surprized to observe from the heights the whole French army drawn up in the plains of Azincour and so posted that it was impossible for him to proceed on his march without coming to an engagement Nothing in appearance could be more unequal than the battle upon which all his safety and his fortunes depended The English army were little more than half the number which had disembarked at Harfleur and laboured under every discouragement and necessity The enemy were four times more numerous were headed by the Dauphin and all the princes of the blood and were plentifully supplied with provisions of every kind Henry's situation was exactly similar to that of Edward at Cressy and that of the black Prince at Poictiers and the memory of these great events inspiring the English with courage made them hope for a like deliverance from their present difficulties The King likewise observed the same prudent conduct which had been followed by these great commanders He drew up his army on a narrow ground between two woods which guarded each flank and he patiently expected in that posture the attack of the enemy  St Remi chap    HAD the French constable been able either to reason justly upon the present circumstances of the two armies or to profit by past experience he had declined a combat and had waited till necessity obliging the English to advance had made them relinquish the advantages of their situation But the impetuous valour of the French nobility and a vain confidence in superior numbers brought on this fatal action which proved the source of infinite calamities to their country The French archers on horseback and their men at arms crowded in their  ranks advanced upon the English archers who had fixed pallisadoes in their front to break the impression of the enemy and who safely plyed them from behind that defence with a shower of arrows which nothing could resist  Walsingham p T Livii p la Laboureur liv chap Monstrelet chap  The clay soil moistened by some rain which had lately fallen proved another obstacle to the force of the French cavalry The wounded men and horses discomposed their ranks The narrow compass in which they were pent hindered them from recovering any order The whole army was a scene of confusion terror and dismay And Henry perceiving his advantage ordered the English archers who were light and unincumbered to advance upon the enemy and seize the moment of victory They fell with their battleaxes upon the French who in their present posture were incapable either of flying or of making defence They hewed them in pieces without resistance  Walsingham p Ypod Neust p  And being seconded by the men at arms who also pushed on against the enemy they covered the field with the killed wounded dismounted and overthrown After all appearance of opposition was over the English had leizure to make prisoners and having advanced with uninterrupted success to the open plain they there saw the remains of the French rear guard which still maintained the appearance of a line of battle At the same time they heard an alarm from behind Some gentlemen of Picardy having collected about peasants had fallen upon the English baggage and were doing execution on the disarmed followers of the camp who fled before them Henry seeing the enemy on all sides of him began to entertain apprehensions from his prisoners and he thought it necessary to issue general orders for putting them to death  T Livii p Le Laboureur liv chap St Remi chap Monstrelet chap Hall fol  But on the discovery of the truth he stopped the slaughter and was still able to save a great number  No battle was ever more fatal to France by the number of princes and nobility slain or taken prisoners Among the former were the Constable himself the count de Nevers and the duke of Brabant brothers to the duke of Burgundy the count de Vaudemont brother to the duke of Lorraine the duke of Alençon the duke of Barre the count de Marle The most eminent prisoners were the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon the counts d'Eu Vendome and Richemont and the mareschal de Boucicaut An archbishop of Sens also perished fighting in this battle The killed are computed on the whole to have amounted to ten thousand men and as the slaughter fell chiefly upon the cavalry it is pretended that of these eight thousand were gentlemen  St Remi chap  This  uthor says he was present in the battle Monstrelet chap makes the number amount t      Henry was master of  prisoners The person of chief note who sell among the English was the duke of York who perished fighting by the King's side and had an end more honourable than his life He was succeeded in his honours and fortune by his nephew son to the earl of Cambridge executed in the beginning of the year All the English who were slain exceeded not forty  Walsingham p Otterbourne p St Remi chap  tho' some writers make the numbers more considerable  Monstrelet chap    THE three great battles of Cressy Poictiers and Azincour bore a singular resemblance to each other in their most considerable circumstances In all of them there appears the same temerity in the English princes who without any object of moment merely for the sake of plunder had ventured so far into the enemies country as to leave themselves no resource and unless saved by the utmost imprudence in the French commanders were from their very situation exposed to inevitable destruction But allowance being made for this temerity which according to the irregular plans of war followed in those ages seems to have been in some measure unavoidable there appears in the day of action the same presence of mind dexterity courage firmness and precaution on the part of the English The same precipitation confusion and vain confidence on the part of the French And the events were such as might have been expected from such opposite conduct The immediate consequences too of these three great victories were similar Instead of pushing the French with vigour and taking advantage of their consternation the English princes after their victory seem rather to have relaxed their efforts and to have allowed the enemy leizure to recover from his losses Henry interrupted not his march a moment after the battle of Azincour he carried his prisoners to Calais and from thence to England he even concluded a truce with the enemy and it was not till after an interval of two years that any body of English troops appeared in France  THE poverty of all the European princes and the small resources of their kingdoms were the causes of these continual interruptions in their hostilities and tho' the maxims of war were in general very destructive their military operations were mere incursions which without any settled plan they carried on against each other The lustre however attending the victory of Azincour procured some supplies from the English parliament tho' still unequal to the expences of a campaign They granted Henry an entire fifteenth of moveables and they conferred on him  for life  the duties of tonnage and poundage and the subsidies on the exportation of wool and leather This concession is more considerable than that which had been granted to Richard II by his last parliament  and which was afterwards on his deposition made so great an article of charge against him  State of France  BUT during this interruption of hostilities from England France was exposed to all the furies of civil war and the several parties became every day more enraged against each other The duke of Burgundy in hopes that the French ministers and generals were entirely discredited by the misfortune at Azincour advanced with a great army to Paris and attempted to reinstate himself in possession of the government as well as of the King's person But his partizans in that city were overawed by the court and kept in subjection The duke despaired of success And he retired with his forces which he immediately dispersed in the low countries  Le Laboureur liv chap    He was next year invited to make a new attempt by some violent quarrels which broke out in the royal family The Queen Isabella daughter of the duke of Bavaria who had been hitherto an inveterate enemy to the Burgundian faction had received a great injury from the other party which the implacable spirit of that princess was never able to forgive The public necessities obliged the count d'Armagnac created constable of France in place of d'Albert to seize the great treasures which Isabella had amassed and when she expressed her displeasure at this injury he inspired into the weak mind of the King some jealousies against her conduct and pushed him to seize and put to the torture and afterwards throw into the Seine Bois bourdon her favourite whom he accused of a commerce of gallantry with that princess The Queen herself was sent to Tours and confined under a guard  St Remi chap Monstrelet chap  and after these multiplied insults she no longer scrupled to enter into a correspondence with the duke of Burgundy As her son the Dauphin Charles a youth of sixteen was entirely governed by the faction of Armagnac she extended her animosity to him and sought his destruction with the most unrelenting hatred She had soon an opportunity of rendering her unnatural purpose effectual The duke of Burgundy in concert with her entered France at the head of a great army He made himself master of Amiens Abbeville Dourlens Montreüil and other towns in Picardy Senlis Rheims Chalons Troye and Auxerre declared themselves for his party  St Remi chap  He got possession of Beaumont Pontoise Vernon Meulant Montsheri towns in the neighbourhood of Paris and carrying farther his progress towards the west he seized Etampes Chartres and other fortresses and was at last able to deliver the Queen who fled to Troye and declared openly against those ministers who she said detained her husband in captivity  St Remi chap Monstrelet chap    MEANWHILE the partizans of Burgundy raised a commotion in Paris which always inclined to that faction LileAdam one of the duke's captains was received into the city in the night time and headed the insurrection of the people which in a moment became so impetuous that nothing could oppose it The person of the King was seized The Dauphin made his escape with difficulty Great numbers of the faction of Armagnac were immediately butchered The count himself and many others of note were thrown into prison Murders were daily committed from private animosity under pretence of faction And the populace not satiated with their fury and deeming the course of public justice too dilatory broke open the prisons and put to death the count d'Armagnac and all the other nobility who were there confined  St Remi chap Monstrelet chap    New  sion of F  st August  WHILE France was in such furious combustion and was so ill prepared to resist a foreign enemy Henry having collected some treasures and levied an army landed in Normandy at the head of men and met with no considerable opposition from any quarter  He made himself master of Falaise and Cherbourg Evreux and Caen submitted to him Pont de l'Arche opened its gates and Henry having subdued all the lower Normandy and received a reinforcement of men from England  Walsing p  formed the siege of Roüen which was defended by a garrison of men seconded by the inhabitants to the number of  St Remi chap  The cardinal des Ursins here attempted to incline him towards peace and to m derate his pretensions But the King replied to him in such terms as shewed that he was fully sensible of all his present advantages  "Do you not see said he that God has led me hither as by the hand France has no sovereign I have just pretensions on that kingdom Every thing is here in the utmost confusion No one thinks of resisting me Can I have a more sensible proof that that Being who disposes of empires has determined to put the crown of France upon my head"  Juvenal des Ursins  BUT tho' Henry had opened his mind to this scheme of ambition he still continued to negotiate with his enemies and endeavoured to obtain more secure tho' less considerable advantages He made at the same time offers of peace to both parties to the Queen and duke of Burgundy on the one hand who having possession of the King's person carried the appearance of legal authority  Rymer vol p  and to the Dauphin on the other who being the undoubted heir of the monarchy was adhered to by every one that had a regard to the true interests of their country  Rymer vol p c  These two parties also carried on a continual negotiation with each other The  terms proposed on all sides were perpetually varying The events of the war and the intrigues of the cabinet intermingled with each other And the fate of France remained long in this uncertainty After many negotiations Henry offered the Queen and the duke of Burgundy to make peace with them to espouse the princess Catharine to accept of all the provinces ceded to Edward III by the treaty of Bretigni with the addition of Normandy which he was to receive in full and entire sovereignty  Rymer vol p  These terms were accepted of  There remained only some circumstances to adjust in order to the full completion of the treaty But in this interval the duke of Burgundy secretly finished his treaty with the Dauphin and these two princes agreed to share the royal authority during King Charles's life and to unite their arms in expelling foreign enemies  Rymer vol p St Remi chap    THIS alliance which seemed to cut off from Henry all hopes of farther success proved in the issue the most favourable event which could have happened for his pretensions Whether the Dauphin and duke of Burgundy were ever sincere in their mutual engagements is uncertain but very fatal effects resulted from their momentary and seeming union The two princes agreed to an interview in order to concert the means of rendering effectual their common attack of the English but how both or either of them could with safety venture upon this conference it seemed somewhat difficult to contrive The assassination perpetrated by the duke of Burgundy and still more his open avowal of the deed and defence of the doctrine tended to dissolve all the bands of civil society and even men of honour who detested the example might deem it just on a favourable opportunity to retaliate upon the author The duke therefore who neither dared to give nor could pretend to require any trust agreed to all the contrivances for mutual security which were proposed by the ministers of the Dauphin The two princes came to Montereau The duke lodged in the castle the Dauphin in the town which was divided from the castle by the river Yonne The bridge between them was chosen for the place of interview Two high rails were drawn across the bridge The gates on each side were guarded the one by the officers of the Dauphin the other by those of the duke The princes were to enter into the intermediate space by the opposite gates accompanied each by ten persons and with all these marks of diffidence to conciliate their mutual friendship But it appeared that no precautions are sufficient where laws have no place and where all principles of honour are utterly abandoned Tannegui de Chatel and others of the Dauphin's retainers were zealous partizans of the house of Orleans and they determined to seize the opportunity of revenging on the assassin the murder of that prince  Assassination of the duke of Burgundy  They no sooner entered the rails than  they drew their swords and attacked the duke of Burgundy His friends were ast nished and thought not of making any defence and all of them either shared his fate or were taken prisoners by the retinue of the Dauphin  St Remi chap Monstrelet chap    THE extreme youth of this prince made it doubtful whether he was admitted  the secret of the conspiracy But as the deed was committed under his eye  most intimate friends who still retained their connexions with him the blame of the action which was certainly more imprudent than criminal fell entirely upon him The whole state of affairs was every where changed by that unexpected incident The city of Paris which was passionately devoted to the family of Burgundy broke out into the highest fury against the Dauphin The court of King Charles entered from interest into the same views and as all the ministers about that monarch had owed their preferment to the late duke and foresaw their downfall if the Dauphin recovered possession of his father's person they were concerned to prevent by any means the success of his enterprize The Queen persevering in her unnatural animosity against her son encreased the general flame and inspired into the King as far as he was susceptible of any sentiment the same prejudices by which she herself had long been actuated But above all Philip count de Charlois now duke of Burgundy thought himself bound by every tye of honour and of duty to revenge the murder of his father and to prosecute the assassin to the utmost extremity And in this general transport of rage every consideration of national and family interest was buried in oblivion by all parties The subjection to a foreign enemy the expulsion of the lawful heir the slavery of the kingdom appeared but small evils if they led to the gratification of the present passion  THE King of England had before the death of the duke of Burgundy profited extremely by the distractions of France and was daily making a considerable progress in Normandy He had taken Roüen after an obstinate siege  T Livii p Monstrelet chap  He had made himself master of Pontoise and Gisors He even threatened Paris and by the terror of his power had obliged the court to remove to Troye And in the midst of his successes he was agreeably surprized to find his enemies instead of c  mbining against him for their mutual defence disposed to rush into his arms and to make him the instrument of their vengeance upon each other A league was immediately concluded at Arras between him and the duke of Burgundy That prince without stipulating any thing for himself except the prosecution of his father's murder and the marriage of the duke of Bedford with his sister was willing to sacrifice the kingdom to Henry's ambition and he agreed to every demand which was made by that monarch In order to finish  that astonishing treaty which was to transfer the crown of France to a stranger Henry went to Troye accompanied by his brother the dukes of Clarence and Glocester  and was there met by the duke of Burgundy The imbecility into which King Charles had fallen made him incapable of seeing any thing but thro' the eyes of those who attended him as they on their part saw every thing thro' the medium of their passions The treaty being already concerted among the parties was immediately drawn and signed and ratified Henry's will seemed to be a law throughout this whole negotiation Nothing was attended to but his advantages  Treaty of Troye  THE principal articles of the treaty were that Henry should espouse the princess Catharine That King Charles during his life time should enjoy the title and dignity of King of France That Henry should be declared and acknowledged heir of the monarchy and be entrusted with the present administration of the government That the kingdom should pass to his heirs whatsoever That France and England should for ever be united under one king but should still retain their several usages customs and privileges That all the princes peers vassals and communities of France should swear both that they would adhere to the future succession of Henry and pay him present obedience as regent That that prince should unite his arms to those of King Charles and the duke of Burgundy in order to subdue the adherents of Charles the pretended Dauphin And that these three princes should make no peace nor truce with him but by common consent and agreement  Rymer vol p St Remi chap Monstrelet chap    SUCH was the tenor of this famous treaty a treaty which as nothing but the most violent animosity could dictate so nothing but the power of the sword could carry it into execution It is hard to say whether its consequences had it taken place would have proved more pernicious to England or to France It must have reduced the former kingdom to the rank of a province It would have entirely disjointed the succession of the latter monarchy and have brought on the destruction of every descendant of the royal family As the houses of Orleans Anjou Alencon Brittany Bourbon and of Burgundy itself whose titles were preferable to that of the English princes would on that account have been exposed to perpetual jealousy and persecution from the sovereign There was even a palpable deficiency in Henry's claim which no art could palliate For besides the insuperable objections to which Edward IIId's pretensions were exposed  he  was not heir to that monarch If female succession was admitted the right had devolved to the house of Mortimer Allowing that Richard II was a tyrant and that Henry IVth's merits in deposing him were so great towards the English  as to justify that nation for placing him on the throne Richard had nowise offended France and his rival had merited nothing of that kingdom It could not possibly be pretended that the crown of France was become an appendage to that of England and that a prince who by any means got possession of the latter was without farther question entitled to the former So that on the whole it must be allowed that Henry's claim to France was if possible still more unintelligible than the title by which his father had mounted the throne of England  BUT tho' all these considerations were overlooked amidst the hurry of passions by which the courts of France and Burgundy were actuated they would necessarily revive during times of more leizure and tranquillity and it behoved Henry to push his present advantages and allow men no leizure for reason or reflection  Marriage of the King  In a few days after he espoused the princess Catherine He carried his father in law to Paris and put himself in possession of that capital He obtained from the parliament and the three estates a ratification of the treaty of Troye He supported the duke of Burgundy in procuring a sentence against the murderers of his father And he immediately turned his arms with success against the adherents of the Dauphin who so soon as he heard of the treaty of Troye took on him the style and authority of regent and appealed to God and his sword for the maintenance of his title  THE first place which Henry subdued was Sens which opened its gates after a slight resistance With the same facility he made himself master of Montereau The defence of Melun was more obstinate Barbasan the governor held out for the space of four months against the besiegers and it was famine alone which obliged him to capitulate Henry promised to spare the lives of all the garrison except such as were accomplices in the murder of the duke of Burgundy and as Barbasan himself was suspected to be of the number his punishment was demanded by Philip But the King had the generosity to intercede for him and to prevent his execution  Holingshed p      THE necessity of providing supplies both of men and money obliged Henry to go over to England and he left the duke of Exeter his uncle governor of Paris during his absence The authority which naturally attends success procured him from the English parliament a subsidy of a fifteenth but if we may judge by the smallness of this supply the nation was no wise sanguine on their King's victories and in proportion as the prospect of their union with France came nearer they began to open their eyes and to see the dangerous consequences with which it  must necessarily be attended It was fortunate for Henry that he had other resources besides pecuniary supplies from his native subjects The provinces which he had already conquered maintained his troops and the hopes of farther advantages allured to his standard all men of ambitious spirits in England who desired to signalize themselves by arms He assembled a new army of twenty four thousand archers and four thousand horsemen  Monstrelet chap  and marched them to Dover the place of embarkation Every thing had remained in tranquillity at Paris under the duke of Exeter but there had happened in another quarter of the kingdom a misfortune which hastened his departure  THE detention of the King of Scots in England had hitherto proved very advantageous to Henry and by keeping the regent in awe had preserved during the whole course of the French war the northern frontier in tranquillity But when intelligence arrived in Scotland of the progress made by Henry and the near prospect of his succession to the crown of France the nation was alarmed and foresaw their own inevitable ruin if the subjection of their ally left them to combat alone an enemy who was already so much superior to them in power and riches The regent entered into the same views and tho' he declined an open war with England he permitted a body of seven thousand Scots under the command of the earl of Buchan his second son to be transported into France for the service of the Dauphin To render this aid ineffectual Henry had carried over the young King of Scots whom he obliged to send orders to his countrymen to leave the French service but the Scots general replied that he would obey no commands which came from a King in captivity and that a prince while in the hands of his enemy was no wise entitled to authority These troops therefore continued still to act under the earl of Buchan and were employed by the Dauphin to oppose the progress of the duke of Clarence in Anjou The two armies encountered at Baugé The English were defeated The duke himself was slain by Sir Allan Swinton a Scots knight who commanded a company of men at arms And the earls of Somerset  His name was John and he was afterwards created duke of Somerset He was grandson of John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster The earl of Dorset was brother to Somerset and succeeded him in that title  Dorset and Huntingdon were taken prisoners  St Remi chap Monstrelet chap Hall fol  This was the first action which turned the tide of success against the English and the Dauphin that he might both attach the Scots to his service and reward the valour and conduct of the earl of Buchan honoured that nobleman with the office of constable  BUT the arrival of the King of England with so considerable an army was more than sufficient to repair this loss Henry was received at Paris with great expressions  of joy so obstinate were the prejudices of the people And he immediately conducted his army to Chartres which had long been besieged by the Dauphin That prince decamped on the approach of the English and being resolved to decline a battle he retired with his army  St Remi chap  Henry made himself master of Dreux without a blow He laid siege to Meaux at the sollicitation of the Parisians who were much incommoded by the garrison of that place This enterprize employed the English arms during the space of eight months The bastard of Vaurus the governor of Meaux distinguished himself by an obstinate defence but was at last obliged to surrender at discretion The cruelty of this officer was equal to his bravery He was accustomed to hang without distinction all the English and Burgundians who fell into his hands And Henry in revenge of his barbarity ordered him immediately to be hanged on the same tree which he had made the instrument of his inhuman executions  Rymer vol p T Livii p St Remi chap Monstrelet chap    THIS success was followed by the surrender of many other places in the neighbourhood of Paris which held for the Dauphin That prince was chaced beyond the Loire and almost totally abandoned all the northern provinces He was even pursued into the south by the united arms of the English and Burgundians and threatened with total destruction Notwithstanding the bravery and fidelity of his captains he saw himself unequal to his enemies in the open field and found it necessary to temporize and to avoid all hazardous actions with a rival who had gained so much the ascendant over him And to crown all the other prosperities of Henry his queen was delivered of a son who was called by his father's name and whose birth was celebrated by rejoicings no less pompous and no less sincere at Paris than at London The infant prince seemed to be universally regarded as the future heir of both monarchies  Death  BUT the glory of Henry when it had nearly reached the summit was stopped short by the hand of nature and all his mighty projects vanished into smoke He was seized with a fistula which the surgeons at that time had not skill enough to cure and he was at last sensible that his distemper was mortal and that his end was approaching He sent for his brother the duke of Bedford the earl of Warwic and a few more noblemen whom he had honoured with his confidence and he delivered to them in great tranquillity his last will with regard to the government of his kingdom and family He entreated them to continue towards his infant son the same fidelity and attachment which they had always professed to him during his lifetime and which had been cemented by so many  mutual good offices He expressed his indifference on the approach of death and tho' he regreted that he must leave unfinished a work so happily begun he declared himself confident that the final acquisition of France would be the effect of their prudence and valour He left the regency of that kingdom to his eldest brother the duke of Bedford that of England to his younger the duke of Glocester and the care of his son's person to the earl of Warwic He recommended to all of them an anxious care to maintain the friendship of the duke of Burgundy and advised them never to give liberty to the French princes taken at Azincour till his son was of age and could himself hold the reins of government And he conjured them if the success of their arms should not enable them to place young Henry on the throne of France never at least to make peace with that kingdom unless the enemy by the cession of Normandy and its annexation to the crown of England made compensation for all the hazards and expence of his enterprize  Monstrelet chap Hall fol    HE next applied himself to his devotions and ordered his chaplain to read the seven penitential psalms When he came to that passage of the fifty first psalm  Build thou the walls of Jerusalem  he interrupted him and professed his serious intention after he should have fully subdued France to have made a croisade against the Infidels and recover possession of the Holy Land  St Remi chap Monstrelet chap  So ingenious are men in deceiving themselves that Henry forgot in those moments all the blood spilt by his ambition and received comfort from this late and feeble resolve which as the mode of these enterprizes was now past he certainly would never have carried into execution  st August  He expired in the thirty fourth year of his age and the tenth of his reign  and character of the King  THIS prince possessed many eminent virtues and if we give indulgence to ambition in a monarch or rank it as the vulgar are inclined to do among his virtues they were unstained by any considerable blemish His abilities appeared equally in the cabinet and in the field the boldness of his enterprizes was no less remarkable than his personal valour in conducting them He had the talent of attaching his friends by affability and of gaining his enemies by address and clemency The English dazzled by the lustre of his character still more than by that of his victories were reconciled to the defects of his title The French almost forgot that he was an enemy And his care of maintaining justice in his civil administration and preserving discipline in his armies made some amends to both nations for the calamities inseparable from those wars in which his short reign was almost entirely occupied That he could forgive the earl of Marche who had a  b  tter right to the throne than himself is a sure proof of his magnanimity and  the earl relied so entirely on his friendship is no less a proof of his established character for candor and sincerity There remain in history few instances of such mutual trust and still fewer where neither party found reason to repent it  THE exterior figure of this great prince as well as his deportment was engaging His stature was somewhat above the middle size his countenance beautiful his limbs genteel and slender but full of vigour and he excelled in all warlike and manly exercises  T Livii p  He left by his queen Catherine of France only one son not full nine months old whose misfortunes in the course of his life surpassed all the glories and successes of his father  IN less than two months after Henry's death Charles VI of France his father in law terminated his unhappy life He had for several years possessed only the appearance of royal authority Yet was this circumstance of considerable moment to the English and divided the duty and affections of the French between them and the Dauphin This prince was proclaimed and crowned King of France at Poictiers under the name of Charles VII Rheims the place where that ceremony was usually performed was at that time in the hands of his enemies  CATHERINE of France Henry's Widow married soon after his death a Welch gentleman Sir Owen Tudor said to be descended from the antient princes of that country She bore him two sons Edmund and Jasper of whom the eldest was created earl of Richmond the second earl of Pembroke The family of Tudor first raised to distinction by this alliance mounted afterwards the throne of England  Miscellaneous transactions  THE long schism which had divided the Latin church for near forty years was finally terminated in this reign by the council of Constance which deposed the Pope John XXIII for his crimes and elected Martin V in his place who was acknowledged by almost all the kingdoms of Europe This great and unusual act of authority in the council gave the Roman Pontiffs ever after a mortal antipathy to these assemblies The same jealousy which had long prevailed in most European countries between the civil aristocracy and monarchy now also took place between these powers in the ecclesiastical body But the great separation of the bishops in the several states and the difficulty of assembling them gave the Pope a mighty advantage and made it more easy for him to collect all the power of the Hierarchy in his own person The cruelty and treachery which attended the punishments of John Huss and Jerome of Prague the unhappy disciples of Wickliffe who were burned alive for their errors by  this council prove this melancholy truth that toleration is none of the virtues of priests in any form of ecclesiastical government But as the English prince had little or no concern in these great transactions we are here the more concise in relating them  THE first commission of array which I we meet with was issued in this reign  Rymer vol p  The military part of the feudal system which was the most essential circumstance of it was entirely dissolved and could no longer serve for the defence of the kingdom Henry therefore when he went to France in empowered certain commissioners to take a review of all the freemen in each county able to bear arms to divide them into companies and to keep them in readiness for resisting the enemy This was the aera when the feudal militia gave place to one which was perhaps still less orderly and regular  WE have an authentic and exact account of the ordinary revenues of the crown during this reign and they amount only to pounds shillings and pence ayear  Rymer vol p  This is nearly the same with the revenues of Henry III and the Kings of England had neither become much richer nor poorer in the course of so many years The ordinary expences of the government amounted to pounds shillings and pence So that the King had of surplus only pounds shillings for the support of his household for his wardrobe for the expence of embassies and other articles This sum was nowise sufficient he was therefore obliged to have frequent recourse to parliamentary supplies and was thus even in time of peace not altogether independant of his people But wars were a monstrous expence which neither the prince's ordinary revenue nor the extraordinary supplies were able to bear and he was always reduced to many miserable shifts in order to make any tolerable figure in them He commonly borrowed money from all quarters he pawned his jewels and sometimes the crown itself  Rymer vol p  he ran in arrears to his army and he was often obliged notwithstanding all these expedients to stop in the midst of his career of victory and to grant truces to the enemy The high pay which was given to soldiers agreed very ill with this low revenue All the extraordinary supplies granted by parliament to Henry during the course of his reign were only seven tenths and fifteenths about pounds  Parliamentary History vol p  It is easy to compute how soon this money must be exhausted by armies of archers and horse when each archer had a sixpence aday  It appears from many passages of Rymer particularly vol p that the King paid  marks ayear for an archer which is a good deal above sixpence aday The price had risen as is natural by raising the denomination of money  and each horseman two shillings The most  splendid successes proved commonly very fruitless when supported by so poor a revenue and the debts and difficulties which he thereby incurred made the King pay dear for his victories The civil administration likewise even in time of peace could never be very regular where the government was so ill enabled to support itself Henry a year before his death owed debts which had been contracted when he was prince of Wales  Rymer vol p  It was in vain that the parliament pretended to restrain him from arbitrary practices when he was reduced to such necessities Tho' the right of levying purveyance for instance had been expressly guarded against by the great charter itself and was frequently complained of by the commons it was found absolutely impracticable to abolish it and the parliament at length submitting to it as a legal prerogative contented themselves with enacting laws to limit and confine it The duke of Glocester in the reign of Richard II possessed a revenue of crowns about pounds ayear of our present money as we learn from Froissart  Liv chap  and was consequently richer than the King himself if all circumstances be duely considered  IT is remarkable that the city of Calais alone was an annual expence on the crown of pounds  Rymer vol p  that is above a third of the common charge of the government in time of peace This fortress was of no use to the defence of England and only gave that kingdom an inlet to annoy France Ireland cost two thousand pounds ayear over and above its own revenue which was certainly very low Every thing contributes to give us a very mean idea of the state of Europe in those ages  FROM the most early times till the reign of Edward III the denomination of money had never been altered A pound sterling was still a pound troy that is about three pounds of our present money That conqueror was first obliged to innovate in this important article In the twentieth year of his reign he coined twentytwo shillings out of a pound troy in his twentyseventh year he coined twentyfive shillings But Henry V who was also a conqueror raised still farther the denomination and coined thirty shillings from a pound troy  Fleetwood's Chronicon Preciosum p  His revenue therefore would be about pounds of our present money and by the cheapness of provisions would be equivalent to above pounds  NONE of the princes of the house of Lancaster ventured to impose taxes without consent of parliament Their doubtful or bad title became so far of advantage to the constitution The rule was then fixed and could not safely be broke afterwards even by more absolute princes  CHAP XX HENRY VI  Government during

supposed to imply less authority They invested the duke of Glocester with the same dignity during the absence of his elder brother  Rymer vol p  Cotton p  and in order to limit the power of both these princes they named a council without whose advice and approbation no measure of importance could be determined  Cotton p  The person and education of the infant prince was committed to Henry Beaufort bishop of Winchester his great uncle and the legitimated son of John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster who as his family could never have  any pretensions to the crown might safely they thought be intrusted with that important charge  Hall fol Monstrelet vol p  The two princes the dukes of Bedford and Glocester who might deem themselves injured by this plan of government yet being persons of great integrity and honour acquiesced willingly in any appointment which seemed to give security to the public and as the wars in France appeared to be the object of greatest moment they avoided every dispute which might throw an obstacle in the way of these conquests  State of France  WHEN the state of affairs between the English and French Kings was considered with a superficial eye every advantage seemed to be on the side of the former and the total expulsion of Charles appeared to be an event which might naturally be expected from the superior power of his rival Tho' Henry was yet in his infancy the administration was devolved on the duke of Bedford the most accomplished prince of his age whose experience prudence valor and generosity perfectly qualified him for this high office and enabled him both to maintain union among his friends and to gain the confidence of his enemies The whole power of England was at his command He was at the head of armies enured to victory He was seconded by the most renowned generals of the age the earls of Somerset Warwic Salisbury Suffolk and Arundel Sir John Talbot and Sir John Fastolfe And besides Guienne the antient inheritance of England he was master of the capital and of all the northern provinces which were best enabled to furnish him with supplies both of men and money and to assist and support his English forces  BUT Charles notwithstanding the present inferiority of his power possessed some advantages derived partly from his situation partly from his personal character which promised him success and served first to controul then to overballance the superior force and opulence of his enemies He was the true and undoubted heir of the monarchy Every Frenchman who knew the interests or desired the independance of his country turned his eyes towards him as its sole refuge The exclusion given him by the imbecillity of his father and the forced or precipitate consent of the states had plainly no validity That spirit of faction which had blinded the people could not long hold them in so gross a delusion Their national and inveterate hatred against the English the authors of all their miseries must soon revive and give them an indignation at bending their necks under the yoke of that hostile people Great nobles and princes accustomed to maintain an independance against their native sovereigns would never endure a subjection to strangers And tho' most of the princes of the blood  were since the Fatal battle of Azincour detained prisoners in England the inhabitants of their demesnes their friends their vassals all declared a zealous attachment to the King and exerted themselves in resisting the violence of foreign invaders  CHARLES himself tho' only in his twentieth year was of a character well calculated to become the object of these benevolent sentiments and perhaps from the favour which naturally attends youth was the more likely on account of his tender age to acquire the goodwill of his native subjects He was a prince of the most friendly and benign disposition of easy and familiar manners and of a just and sound tho' not a very vigorous understanding Sincere generous affable he engaged from affection the services of his followers even while his low fortunes might make it their interest to desert him and the lenity of his temper could pardon in them those sallies of discontent to which princes in his situation are so frequently exposed The love of pleasure often seduced him into indolence but amidst all his irregularities the goodness of his heart still shone forth and by exerting at intervals his courage and activity he proved that his general remissness proceeded not from the want either of a just spirit of ambition or of personal valor  THO' the virtues of this amiable prince lay some time in obscurity the duke of Bedford knew that his title alone made him formidable and that every foreign assistance would be requisite ere a regent of England could hope to complete the conquest of France an enterprize which however it might seem to be much advanced was still exposed to many and great difficulties The chief circumstance which had procured to the English all their present advantages was the resentment of the duke of Burgundy against Charles and as that prince seemed intent rather on gratifying his passion than cousulting his interests it was the more easy for the regent by demonstrations of respect and confidence to retain him in the alliance of England He bent therefore all his endeavours to that purpose He gave the duke every proof of friendship and regard He even proffered him the regency of France which Philip declined And that he might corroborate national connexions by private ties he concluded his own marriage with the princess of Burgundy which had been stipulated by the treaty of Arras  BEING sensible that next to the alliance of Burgundy the friendship of the duke of Brittany was of the greatest importance towards forwarding the English conquests and that as the provinces of France already subdued lay between the dominions of these two princes he could never hope for any security without  preserving his connexions with them he was very intent on strengthening himself also from that quarter The duke of Brittany having received many just reasons of displeasure from the ministers of Charles had already acceded to the treaty of Troye and had with other vassals of the crown done homage to Henry V in quality of heir to the kingdom But as the regent knew that the duke was much governed by his brother the count de Richemont he endeavoured to fix his friendship by paying his court and doing services to this haughty and ambitious prince  ARTHUR count de Richemont had been taken prisoner at the battle of Azincour had been treated with great indulgence by the late King and had even been permitted on his parole to take a journey into Brittany where the state of affairs required his presence The death of that victorious monarch happened before Riehemont's return and this prince pretended that as his word was given personally to Henry V he was not bound to fulfil it towards his son and successor  April  A chicane which the regent as he could not force him to compliance deemed it prudent to overlook An interview was settled at Amiens between the dukes of Bedford Burgundy and Brittany at which the count de Richemont was also present  Hall fol Monstrelet vol p Stowe p  The alliance was renewed between these princes And the regent persuaded Philip to give in marriage to Richemont his eldest sister widow of the deceased Dauphin Lewis the elder brother of Charles Thus Arthur was connected both with the regent and the duke of Burgundy and seemed engaged by interest to prosecute the same object in forwarding the progress of the English arms  WHILE the vigilance of the duke of Bedford was employed in gaining or confirming these allies whose neighbourhood rendered them so important he did not overlook the state of more remote countries The duke of Albany regent of Scotland had died and his power had devolved to Murdac his son a prince of a weak understanding and of indolent dispositions who far from possessing the talents requisite for the government of that fierce people was not even able to maintain authority in his own family or restrain the petulance and insolence of his sons The ardor of the Scots to serve in France where Charles treated them with great honour and distinction and where the regent's brother enjoyed the dignity of constable broke out a fresh under this feeble administration New succours daily came over and filled the armies of the French King The earl of Douglas c  nducted a reinforcement of men to his assistance And it was justly to be dreaded that the Scots by commencing open hostilities in the north  would occasion a diversion still more considerable of the English power and would ease Charles in part of that load by which he was at present so grievously oppressed The duke of Bedford therefore persuaded the English council to form an alliance with James their prisoner to free that prince from his long captivity and to connect him with England by marrying him to a daughter of the earl of Somerset and cousin of the young King  Hall fol Stowe p Grafton p  As the Scots regent tired of his present dignity which he was not able to support was now become entirely sincere in his applications for James's liberty the treaty was soon concluded forty thousand pounds of ransom were stipulated  Rymer vol p  and the King of Scots was restored to the throne of his ancestors and proved in his short reign one of the most illustrious princes who had ever governed that kingdom He was murdered in by his traiterous kinsman the earl of Athole His affections inclined him to the party of France but the English had never reason during his lifetime to complain of any breach of the neutrality by Scotland  Military operations  BUT the regent was not so employed in these political negotiations as to miltary operations neglect the operations of war from which alone he could hope to succeed in expelling the French monarch Tho' the chief seat of Charles's power lay in the southern provinces on the other side of the Loire his partizans were possessed of some fortresses in the northern and even in the neighbourhood of Paris and it behoved the duke of Bedford first to clear these countries of the enemy before he could think of attempting more distant conquests The castle of Dorsoy was taken after a siege of six weeks That of Noyelle and the town of Rüe in Piccardy underwent the same fate Pont sur Seine Vertus Montaigu were subjected by the English arms And a more considerable advantage was soon after gained by the united forces of England and Burgundy John Stuart constable of Scotland and the lord d'Estissac had formed the siege of Crevant in Burgundy The earls of Salisbury and Suffolk with the count de Toulongeon were sent to its relief A fierce and well disputed action ensued The Scots and French were defeated The constable of Scotland and the count de Ventadour were taken prisoners And above a thousand men among whom was Sir William Hamilton were left on the field of battle  Hall fol Monstrel vol p Holingshed p Grafton p  The taking of Gaillon upon the Seine and of la Charité upon the Loire was the fruit of this victory And as this latter place opened an entrance into the southern provinces the acquisition of it appeared on that account of the greater importance to the duke of Bedford and seemed to promise a successful issue to the war  THE more King Charles was threatened with an invasion in those provinces which adhered to him the more necessary it became that he should retain possession of every fortress which he still held within the quarters of the enemy The duke of Bedford had besieged in person during the space of three months the town of Yvri in Normandy and the brave governor unable to make any longer defence was obliged to capitulate and he agreed to surrender the town if before a certain term no relief arrived to him Charles informed of these conditions determined to make an attempt for saving the place He collected with some difficulty an army of men of whom the half were Scots and he sent them thither under the command of the earl of Buchan the cons able who was attended by the earl of Douglas his countryman the duke of Alençon the mareschal de la Fayette the count d'Aumale and the viscount de Narbonne When the constable arrived within a few leagues of Yvri he found that he was come too late and that the place was already surrendered He immediately turned to the left and sat down before Verneuil which the inhabitants in spite of the garrison delivered up to him  Monstrelet vol p Grafton p  Buchan might now have returned in safety and with the glory of making an acquisition no less important than the place which he was sent to relieve But hearing of Bedford's approach he called a council of war and asked their opinions with regard to the conduct which he should fellow in this emergence The wiser part of the council declared for a retreat and represented that all the past misfortunes of the French had proceeded from their rashness in giving battle when no necessity obliged them to risque a decisive action that this army was the last resource of the King and the only defence of the few provinces which remained to him and that every reason invited him to embrace cautious councils which left time for his subjects to return to their sense of duty and gave leisure for discord to arise among his enemies who being united by no common band of interest or motive of alliance could not long persevere in their animosity against him All these prudential considerations were overborne by a vain point of honour not to turn their backs to the enemy and they resolved to await the arrival of the duke of Bedford  th of Aug B  ttle of Verneuil  THE numbers were nearly equal in this rencounter and as the long continuance of the war had introduced discipline which however imperfect sufficed to maintain some appearance of order in such small armies the battle was fierce and well disputed and attended with bloodshed on both sides The constable drew up his forces under the walls of Verneuil and resolved to abide the attack of the enemy But the impatience of the viscount of Narbonne who broke his ranks and ob iged the whose line to follow him in some hurry and confusion  was the cause of the misfortune which ensued The English archers fixing their pal sadoes before them according to their usual custom sent a volley of arrows into the thickest of the French army and tho' beat from their ground and obliged to take shelter among the baggage they soon rallied and continued to commit great slaughter upon the enemy The duke of Bedford meanwhile at the head of the men at arms made impression on the French broke their ranks chaced them off the field and rendered the victory entirely compleat and decisive  Hall fol Monstrelet vol p Stowe p Holingshed p  The constable himself perished in battle the earl of Douglas and his son the counts of Aumale Fonnerre and Ventadour with many other considerable nobility The duke of Alençon the mareschal de la Fayette the lords of Gaucour and Mortemar were taken prisoners There fell about four thousand of the French and sixteen hundred of the English a loss then esteemed so unusual on the side of the victors that the duke of Bedford prohibited all rejoicings for his success Verneuil was surrendered next day upon capitulation  Monstrelet vol p    THE condition of the King of France appeared now very terrible and almost desperate He had lost the flower of his army and the bravest of his nobles in this fatal action He had no resources for recruiting or subsisting his troops He wanted money even for his personal subsistance and tho' all parade of a court was banished it was with difficulty he could keep a table supplied with the plainest necessaries for himself and his few followers Every day brought him intelligence of some loss or misfortune Towns which were bravely defended were obliged at last to surrender for want of relief or supply He saw his partizans entirely chaced from all the provinces which lay north of the Loire And he expected soon to lose by the united efforts of his enemies all the territories of which he had hitherto continued master when an accident happened which saved him on the brink of ruin and lost the English such an opportunity for compleating their conquests as they never afterwards were able to recall  JAQUELINE countess of Hainault and Holland and heir of these provinces had espoused John duke of Brabant cousin german to the duke of Burgundy but having unhappily made this choice from the usual motives of princes she soon found reason to repent her of the unequal alliance She was a princess of a masculine spirit and uncommon understanding the duke of Brabant was of a sickly complexion and weak mind She was in the vigour of her age he had only reached his fifteenth year These causes had inspired her with such contempt of her husband which soon proceeded to antipathy that she determined to break a marriage where it is probable nothing but the ceremony had as yet intervened  The court of Rome was commonly very open to applications of this nature when seconded by power and money but as the princess foresaw great opposition from her husband's relations and was impatient to effect her purpose she made her escape into England and threw herself under the protection of the duke of Glocester That prince with many noble qualities had the defect of being governed by an impetuous temper and vehement passions and he was rashly induced as well by the charms of the countess herself as by the prospect of possessing her r  ch inheritance to offer himself to her as a husband Without waiting for a papal dispensation without endeavouring to reconcile the duke of Burgundy to this measure he entered into a contract of marriage with Jaqueline and immediately attempted to put himself in possession of her dominions Philip was disgusted with so precipitant a conduct He resented the injury done to the duke of Brabant his near relation He dreaded to have the English established on all sides of him And he foresaw the consequences which must attend the extensive and uncontrouled dominion of that nation if before the full settlement of their power they insulted and injured an ally to whom they had already been so much indebted and who was so necessary for supporting them in their farther progress He encouraged therefore the duke of Brabant to make resistance He engaged many of Jaqueline's subjects to adhere to that prince He himself marched troops to his support And as the duke of Glocester still persevered in his purpose a sharp war was suddenly kindled in the LowCountries The quarrel soon became personal as well as political The English prince wrote to the duke of Burgundy complaining of the opposition made to his pretensions and tho' in the main he employed amicable terms in his letter he took notice of some falsehoods into which Philip had been betrayed during the course of these transactions This unguarded expression was highly resented The duke of Burgundy insisted that he should retract it And mutual challenges and defiances passed between them on this occasion  Monstrelet vol p    THE duke of Bedford could easily forsee the bad effects of so illtimed and imprudent a quarrel All the succurs which he expected from England and which were so necessary in this critical emergence were intercepted by his brother and employed in Holland and Hainault The forces of the duke of Burgundy which he also depended on were diverted by the same wars And besides this double less he was in imminent danger of alienating for ever that confederate whose friendship was of the utmost importance to his interests and whom the late King had injoined him with his dying breath to gratify by every mark of regard and attachment He inforced all these topics to the duke of Glocester He endeavoured  to mitigate the resentment of the duke of Burgundy He interposed with his good offices between these princes But he was not successful in any of his endeavours and he found that the impetuosity of his brother's temper was still the chief obstacle to all accommodation  Monstrelet p  For this reason instead of pushing the victory gained at Verneüil he found himself obliged to take a journey into England and to try by his councils and authority to moderate the measures of the duke of Glocester  THERE had likewise broke out some differences among the English ministry which had proceeded to great extremities and which required the regent's presence to compose them  Stowe p Holingshed p  The bishop of Winchester to whom the care of the King's person and education had been entrusted was a prelate of great capacity and experience but of an intriguing and dangerous character and as he aspired to the government of affairs he had continual disputes with his nephew the protector and he gained frequent advantages over the vehement and impolitic temper of that prince  The duke of Bedford employed the authority of parliament to reconcile them and these rivals were obliged to promise before that assembly that they would bury all quarrels in oblivion  Hall fol Holingshed p Polydore Virgil p  Grafton p  Time also seemed to open expedients for composing the difference with the duke of Burgundy The credit of that prince had procured a bull from the Pope by which not only Jaqueline's contract with the duke of Glocester was annulled but it was also declared that even in case of the duke of Brabant's death it should never be lawful for her to espouse the English prince Humphrey despairing of success married another lady of inferior rank who had lived some time with him as his mistress  Stowe p  The duke of Brabant died and his widow before she could recover possession of her dominions was obliged to declare the duke of Burgundy her heir in case she died without children and to promise never to marry any person without his consent But tho' the affair was thus terminated to the advantage of Philip it left a disagreeable impression on his mind It excited an extreme jealousy of the English and opened his eyes to his true interests And as nothing but his animosity against Charles had engaged him in alliance with them it counterballanced that passion by another of the same kind which in the end became prevalent and brought him back by degrees to his natural connexions with his family and his native country  ABOUT the same time the duke of Brittany began to withdraw himself from the English alliance His brother the count de Richemont tho' connected by  marriage with the dukes of Burgundy and Bedford was extremely attached by inclination to the French interest and he willingly hearkened to all the advances which Charles made him for obtaining his friendship The high office of constable vacant by the earl of Buchan's death was offered him and as his martial and ambitious temper aspired to the command of armies which he had in vain attempted to obtain from the duke of Bedford he not only accepted that trust but brought over his brother to an alliance with the French monarch The new constab e having made this one change in his measures firmly adhered ever after to his engagements with France Tho' his pride and violence which would admit of no rival in his master's confidence and even prompted him to assassinate the other favourites had so much disgusted Charles that he once banished him the court and refused to admit him to his presence he still acted with vigour for the service of that monarch and obtained at last by his perseverance the pardon of all his past offences  IN this situation the duke of Bedford on his return f und the affairs of France after passing eight months in England The duke of Burgundy was much disgusted The duke of Brittany had entered into engagements with Charles and had done homage to that prince for his dutchy The French had been allowed to recover from the astonishment into which their frequent disasters had thrown them An incident even happened which served extremely to raise their courage The earl of Warwic had besieged Montargis with a small army of men and the place was reduced to extremity when the bastard of Orleans undertook to throw relief into it This general who was natural son to the prince assassinated by the duke of Burgundy and who was afterwards created count de Dunois conducted a body of men to Montargis and made an attack on the enemy's trenches with so much valour prudence and good fortune that he not only penetrated into the place but gave a severe blow to the English and obliged Warwic to raise the siege  Monstrelet vol p Holingshed p  This was the first signal action which raised the fame of Dunois and opened him the road to all those great honours which he afterwards attained  BUT the regent soon after his arrival revived the credit of the English arms by an important enterprize which he happily atchieved He secretly brought together in separate detachments a considerable army to the frontiers of Brittany and tell so unexpectedly upon that pro ince that the duke unable to make resistance yielded to all the terms required of him He renounced the French all  ance he engaged to maintain the treaty of Troye he acknowleged the duke  of Bedford for regent of France and promised to do homage for his dutchy to King Henry  Monstrelet vol p  And the English prince having thus freed himself from a dangerous enemy who lay behind him resolved on an undertaking which if successful would he hoped cast the balance between the two nations and prepare the way for the final conquest of France  Orleans  THE city of Orleans was so situated between the provinces commanded by Henry and those possessed by Charles that it opened an easy entrance to either and as the duke of Bedford intended to make a great effort to penetrate into the south of France it behoved him to begin with this place which in the present circumstances was become the most important in the kingdom He committed the conduct of the enterprize to the earl of Salisbury who had newly brought him over a reinforcement of men from England and who had much distinguished himself by his abilities during the course of the present wars Salisbury passing the Loire made himself master of several small places which surrounded Orleans on that side  Monstrelet vol p  Poly Virg p    and as his intentions were thereby known the French King used every expedient to supply the city with a garrison and provisions and enable it to maintain a long and obstinate siege The lord of Gaucour a brave and experienced captain was appointed governor Many officers of distinction threw themselves into the place The troops which they conducted were enured to war and were determined to make the most obstinate resistance And even the inhabitants disciplined by the long continuance of hostilities were well qualified in their own defence to second the efforts of the most veteran sorces The eyes of all Europe were turned towards this scene where it was reasonably supposed the French were to make their last stand for maintaining the independance of their monarchy and the rights of their sovereign  THE earl of Salisbury at last approached the place with an army which consisted only of men and not being able with so small a force to invest so great a city that commanded a bridge over the Loire he stationed himself on the southern side towards Sologne leaving the other towards the Beausse still open to the enemy He there attacked the fortifications which guarded the entry to the bridge and after an obstinate resistance he carried several of th m But was himself killed by a cannon ball as he was taking a view of the enemy  Hall fol Monstrelet vol p Stowe p Holingshed p  Grafton p    The earl of Suffolk succeeded to the command and being reinforced with great numbers of English and Burgundians he passed the river with the main body of his army and invested Orleans on the other side As it was now the depth of winter  Suffolk who found it difficult in that season to throw up intrenchments all around contented himself for the present with erecting redoubts at different distances where his men were lodged in safety and were ready to intercept the supplies which the enemy might attempt to throw into the place Tho' he had several pieces of artillery in his camp and this is the first siege in Europe where cannon were found to be of imp rtance the art of eng neering was hitherto so imperfect that Suffolk trusted more to famine than force for subduing the city and he proposed in the spring to render the circumvallation more compleat by drawing intrenchments from one redoubt to another Numberless seats of valour were performed both by the besiegers and besieged during this winter Bold sallies were made and repulsed with equal boldness Convoys were sometimes introduced and often intercepted The supplies were still unequal to the consumption of the place And the English seemed daily tho' slowly to be advancing towards the completion of their enterprize  BUT while they lay in this situation the French parties ravaged all the country around and the besiegers who were obliged to draw their provisions from a distance were themselves exposed to the danger of want and famine Sir John Fastolffe was bringing up a large convoy of every kind of stores which he escorted with a detachment of men when he was attacked by a body of French under the command of the counts of Clermont and Dunois Fastolffe drew up behind his waggons but the French generals cautious of attacking him in that posture planted a battery of cannon against him which threw every thing into confusion and would have ensured them the victory had not the impatience of some Scots troops who broke the line of battle brought on an engagement in which Fastolffe was victorious The count de Dunois was wounded and above French were left on the field of battle This action which was of great importance in the present conjuncture was commonly called the battle of  Herrings  because the convoy brought a great quantity of that kind of provisions for the use of the English army during the Lent season  Hall fol Monstrelet vol p Stowe p Holingshed p Polyd Virg p Grafton p    CHARLES seemed now to have but one expedient for saving this city which had been so long invested The duke of Orleans who was still prisoner in England prevailed on the protector and the council to consent that all his demesnes should be allowed to preserve a neutrality during the war and should be sequestered for greater security into the hands of the duke of Burgundy This  prince who was much less cordial in the English interests than formerly went to Paris and made the proposal to the duke of Bedford but the regent replied very coldly that he was not of a humour to beat the bushes while others ran away with the game An answer which so much disgusted the duke that he recalled all the troops of Burgundy that acted in the siege  Hall fol Monstrelet vol p Stowe p Grafton p  The place however was every day more and more closely invested by the English Great scarcity began already to be felt by the garrison and inhabitants Charles in despair of collecting an army which should dare to approach the enemy's entrenchments not only gave the city for lost but began to entertain a very dismal prospect with regard to the general state of his affairs He saw that the country in which he had hitherto with great difficulty subsisted would be laid entirely open to the invasion of a powerful and victorious enemy and he talked already of retiring with the remains of his forces into Languedoc and Dauphiny and of defending himself as long as possible in that distant quarter But it was fortunate for this good prince that he lay under the dominion of women and that the women whom he consulted had the spirit to support his sinking resolutions in this desperate extremity Mary of Anjou his Queen a princess of great merit and prudence vehemently opposed this measure which she foresaw would discourage all his partizans and serve as a general signal for deserting a prince who seemed himself to despair of success His mistress too the fair Agnes Sorel who lived in entire amity with the Queen seconded all her remonstrances and threatened that if he thus pusillanimously threw away the scepter of France she would seek in the court of England a fortune more correspondent to her wishes Love was able to rouze in the breast of Charles that courage which ambition had failed to excite He resolved to dispute every inch of ground with an imperious enemy and rather to perish with honour in the midst of his friends than yield ingloriously to his bad fortune When relief was unexpectedly brought him by another female of a very different character who gave rise to one of the most singular revolutions that is to be met with in history  The maid of Orleans  IN the village of Domremi near Vaucouleurs on the borders of Lorraine there lived a country girl of twentyseven years of age called Joan d'Arc who was servant in a small inn and who in that station had been accustomed to tend the horses of the guests to ride them without a saddle to the wateringplace and to perform other offices which in wellfrequented inns commonly fall to to the share of the men servants  Hall fol Monstrelet vol p Grafton p  This girl was of an irreproachable life and  had not hitherto been remarked for any singularity whether that she had met with no occasion to excite her genius or that the unskilful eyes of those who conversed with her had not been able to discern her uncommon merit It is easy to imagine that the present situation of France was an interesting object even to persons of the lowest rank and would become the frequent subject of their conversation A young prince expelled his native throne by the sedition of subjects and by the arms of strangers could not fail to move the compassion of all his people whose hearts were uncorrupted by faction and the peculiar character of Charles so strongly inclined to friendship and the tender passions naturally rendered him the hero of that sex whose generous minds know no bounds in their affections The siege of Orleans the progress of the English before that place the great distress of the garrison and inhabitants the importance of saving the city and ts brave defenders had turned thither the eyes of all the world and Joan inflamed by the general sentiment was seized with a wild desire of bringing relief to her sovereign in his present distresses Her unexperienced mind working day and night on this favourite object mistook the impulses of her passion for heavenly inspirations and she fancied that she saw visions and heard voices exhorting her to reestablish the throne of France and to expel the foreign invaders An uncommon intrepidity of temper made her overlook all the dangers which might attend her in such a path and thinking herself destined by heaven to this office she threw aside that bashfulness and timidity which would naturally adhore to her sex her years and her low station She went to Baudricourt governor of Vaucouleurs procured adm ssion to him informed him of her inspirations and intentions and conjured him not to neglect the voice of God who spoke thro' her but to second those heavenly revelations which impelled her to this glorious enterprize Baudricourt treated her at first with some neglect but on her frequent returns to him and importunate sollicitations he began to remark something extraordinary in the maid and was inclined at a l hazards to make so easy an experiment It is uncertain whether this gentleman had discernment enough to perceive that great use might be made with the vulgar of so uncommon an engine or what is more likely in that credulous age was himself a convert to t  is visionary But he adopt d at last the scheme of Joan and he gave her som  attendants who conducted her to the French court which at that time resided at Chinon  IT is the busin  s of history to distinguish between the  miraculous  and the  marvel    to reject the fi  in a  l narrations merely profane and human to s  ple the  and when obli  d by undoubted testimony as in the present case admit of something extraordinary to receive as little of it as is consistent  with the known facts and circumstances It is pretended that Joan immediately on her admission knew the King tho' she had never seen his face before and tho' he purposely kept himself in the crowd of courtiers and had laid aside every thing in his dress and apparel which might distinguish him That she offered him in the name of the supreme Creator to raise the siege of Orleans and conduct him to Rheims to be there crowned and anointed and on his expressing some doubts of her mission revealed to him before some sworn confidents a secret which was unknown to all the world but himself and which nothing but a heavenly inspiration could discover to her And that she demanded as the instrument of her future victories a particular sword which was kept in the church of St Catharine de Fierbois and which tho' she had never seen it she described by all its marks and by the place in which it had long been laid and neglected  Hall fol Holingshed p  This is certain that all these miraculous stories were spread abroad in order to catch the vulgar The more the King and his ministers were determined to give into the illusion the more scruples they pretended An assembly of grave doctors and theologians cautiously examined Joan's mission and pronounced it undoubted and supernatural She was sent to the parliament then residing at Poictiers and was interrogated before that assembly The presidents the counsellors who came persuaded of her imposture went away convinced of her inspiration A ray of hope began to break thro' that despair in which the minds of all men were before enveloped Heaven had now declared itself in favour of France and had laid bare its outstretched arm to take vengeance on her invaders Few could distinguish between the impulse of inclination and the force of conviction and none would submit to the trouble of so disagreeable a scrutiny  AFTER these artificial precautions and preparations had been for some time employed Joan's requests were at last complied with She was armed capapee mounted on horseback and shown in that martial habiliment before the whole people Her dexterity in managing her steed tho' acquired in her former occupation was regarded as a new proof of her mission and she was received with the loudest acclamations by the spectators Her former occupation was even denied She was no longer the servant of an inn She was converted into a shepherdess an employment much more agreeable to the imagination To render her still more interesting near ten years were substracted from her age and all the sentiments of love and of chivalry were thus united to those of enthusiasm in order to inflame the fond fancy of the people with prepossessions in her favour  WHEN the engine was thus dressed up in full splendor it was time to essay its force against the enemy Joan was sent to Blois where a large convoy was prepared for the supply of Orleans and an army of ten thousand men under the command of St Severe assembled to escort it She ordered all the soldiers to confess themselves before they set out on the enterprize She banished from the camp all women of bad fame She displayed in her hands a consecrated banner where the Supreme Being was represented grasping the globe of earth and surrounded with Flower de Luces And she insisted in right of her prophetic mission that the convoy should enter Orleans by the direct road from the side of Beausse but the count de Dunois unwilling to submit the rules of the military art to her inspirations ordered it to approach by the other side of the river where he knew the weakest part of the English army was stationed  PREVIOUS to this attempt the maid had wrote to the regent and to the English generals before Orleans commanding them in the name of the omnipotent Creator by whom she was commissioned immediately to raise the siege and to evacuate France and menacing them with divine vengeance in case of their disobedience All the English affected to speak with derision of the Maid and of her heavenly commission and said that the French King was now indeed reduced to a sorry pass when he had recourse to such ridiculous expedients But they felt their imagination secretly struck with the vehement persuasion which prevailed in all around them and they waited with an anxious expectation not unmixed with horror for the issue of these extraordinary preparations  AS the convoy approached the river a sally was made by the garrison on the side of Beausse to prevent the English general from sending any detachment to the other side  th April  The provisions were peaceably embarked in boats which the inhabitants of Orleans had sent to receive them The maid covered with her troops the embarkation Suffolk ventured not to attack her And the French general carried back the army in safety to Blois an alteration of affairs which was already visible to all the world and which had a proportional effect on the minds of both parties  THE Maid entered the town of Orleans arrayed in her military garb and displaying her consecrated standard and was received as a celestial deliverer by all the inhabitants They now believed themselves invincible under her sacred influence and Dunois himself perceiving such a mighty alteration both in friends and foes consented that the next convoy which was expected in a few days should enter by the side of Beausse  th May  The convoy approached Nosign of resistance appeared in the besiegers The waggons and troops passed  without interruption between the redoubts of the English A dead silence and astonishment reigned among those troops formerly so elated with victory and so fierce for the combat  THE earl of Suffolk was in a situation very unusual and extraordinary and which might well confound the man of the greatest capacity and firmest temper He saw his troops overawed and strongly impressed with the idea of a divine influence accompanying the Maid Instead of banishing these vain terrors by hurry and action and war he waited till the soldiers should recover from the panic and he thereby gave leizure for these prepossessions to sink still deeper into their minds The military maxims which are prudent in common cases deceived him in these unaccountable events The English felt their courage daunted and overwhelmed and thence inferred a divine vengeance hanging over them The French drew the same inference from an inactivity so new and unexpected Every circumstance was now reversed in the opinions of men on which all depends The spirit resulting from a long course of uninterrupted success was on a sudden transferred from the victors to the vanquished  THE Maid called aloud that the garrison should remain no longer on the defensive and she promised her followers the assistance of heaven in attacking those redoubts of the enemy which had so long kept them in awe and which they had never hitherto dared to insult The generals seconded her ardor An attack was made on one redoubt and it proved successful  Monstrelet vol p  All the English who defended the entrenchments were put to the sword or taken prisoners And Sir John Talbot himself who had drawn together from the other redoubts some troops to bring them relief dared not to appear in the open field against so formidable an enemy  NOTHING seemed impossible after this success to the Maid and her enthusiastic votaries She urged the generals to attack the main body of the English in their entrenchments But Dunois still unwilling to hazard the fate of France by too great temerity and sensible that the least reverse of fortune would make all the present visions evaporate and restore every thing to its former condition checked her vehemence and proposed to her first to expel the enemy from their forts on the other side of the river and thus lay the communication with the country entirely open before she attempted any more hazardous enterprize Joan was persuaded and these forts were vigorously assailed In one attack the French were repulsed the Maid was left almost alone she was obliged to retreat and join the runaways but displaying her sacred standard and animating them  with her countenance her gestures her exhortations she led them back to the charge and overpowered the English in their entrenchments In the attack of another fort she was wounded in the neck with an arrow she retreated a moment behind the assailants she pulled out the arrow with her own hands she had the wound quickly dressed and she hastened back to head the troops and to plant her victorious banner on the ramparts of the enemy  BY all these successes the English were entirely chaced from their fortifications on that side They had lost above six thousand men in these different actions and what was still more important their wonted courage and confidence was wholly gone and had given place to amazement and despair The Maid returned triumphant over the bridge and was again received as the guardian angel of the city After performing such miracles she convinced the most obdurate incredulity of her divine mission Men felt themselves animated as by a superior energy and thought nothing impossible to that divine hand which so visibly conducted them It was in vain even for the English generals to oppose with their soldiers the prevailing opinion of supernatural influence They themselves were probably moved by the same belief The utmost they dared to advance was that Joan was not an instrument of God she was only the implement of the Devil But as the English had felt to their sad experience that the Devil might be allowed sometimes to prevail they derived not much consolation from the enforcing of this opinion  The siege of Orleans ra  d  IT might prove extremely dangerous for Suffolk with such intimidated troops to remain any longer in the presence of such a courageous and victorious enemy and he therefore raised the siege and retreated with all the precautions imaginable  th May  The French resolved to push their conquests and to allow the English no leizure to recover from their consternation Charles formed a body of six thousand men and sent them to attack Jergeau whither Suffolk had retired with a detachment of his army The siege lasted ten days and the place was obstinately defended Joan displayed her wonted intrepidity on this occasion She descended into the fossee in leading the attack and she there received a blow on the head with a stone by which she was confounded and beat to the ground But she soon recovered herself and in the end rendered the assault successful Suffolk was obliged to yield himself prisoner to a Frenchman called Renaud but before the submitted he asked his adversary whether he was a gentleman On receiving a satisfactory answer he demanded whether he was a knight Renaud replied that he had not yet attained that honour  Then I make you one  replied Suffolk Upon which he gave him the blow with his  sword which dubbed him into that fraternity and he immediately surrendered himself his prisoner  THE remainder of the English army was commanded by Fastolfe Scales and Talbot who thought of nothing but of making their retreat as soon as possible into a place of safety while the French esteemed the overtaking them equivalent to a victory So much had the events which passed before Orleans altered every thing between the two nations The vanguard of the French under Xaintrailles attacked the rear of the enemy at the village of Patay  th June  The battle lasted not a moment The English were discomfited and fled The brave Fastolfe himself showed the example of flight to his troops and the order of the garter was taken from him as a punishment for this instance of cowardice  Monstrelet vol p  Two thousand men were killed in this action and both Talbot and Scales taken prisoners  IN the account of all these successes the French writers to magnify the wonder represent the Maid who was now known by the appellation of  the maid of Orleans  as not only active in the combats but as performing the office of general directing the troops conducting the military operations and swaying the deliberations in all councils of war It is certain that the policy of the French court endeavoured to maintain this appearance with the public But it is much more probable that Dunois and the wiser commanders prompted her in all her measures than that a country girl without experience or education could on a sudden become expert in a profession which requires more genius and capacity than any other active scene of life It is sufficient praise that she could distinguish the persons on whose judgment she might rely that she could seize their hints and suggestions and on a sudden deliver their opinion as her own and that she could curb on occasion that visionary and enthusiastic spirit with which she was undoubtedly actuated and could temper it with prudence and discretion  THE raising of the siege of Orleans was one part of the Maid's promise to Charles The crowning him at Rheims was the other And she now insisted vehemently that he should forthwith set out on that enterprize A few weeks before such a proposal would have appeared the most extravagant in the world Rheims lay in a distant quarter of the kingdom was then in the hands of a victorious enemy the whole road which led to it was occupied by their garrisons and no imagination could be so sanguine as to think that such an attempt could so soon come within the bounds of possibility But as it was extremely  the interest of Charles to maintain the belief of something extraordinary and divine in these events and to avail himself of the present consternation of the English he resolved to follow the exhortations of his warlike prophetess and to lead his army upon this promising adventure Hitherto he had kept remote from the scene of war As the safety of the state depended entirely upon his person he had been persuaded to restrain his military ardour But observing this prosperous turn of affairs he now determined to appear at the head of his armies and to set the example of valour to all his soldiers And the French nobility saw at once their young sovereign assuming a new and more brilliant character seconded by fortune and conducted by the hand of heaven and they caught fresh zeal to exert themselves in replacing him on the throne of his ancestors  The King of France crowned at Rheims  CHARLES set out for Rheims at the head of twelve thousand men He passed by Troye which opened its gates to him Chalons imitated the example Rheims sent him a deputation with its keys before his approach to it And he scarce perceived as he passed along that he was marching thro' an enemy's country  th July  The ceremony of his coronation was here performed  Monstrelet vol p  with the holy oil which a pigeon had brought to King Clovis from heaven on the first establishment of the French monarchy The maid of Orleans stood by his side in compleat armour and displaying her sacred banner which had so often dissipated and confounded his fiercest enemies And the people shouted with the most unfeigned joy on viewing such a complication of wonders After the completion of the ceremony the Maid threw herself at the King's feet embraced his knees and with a flood of tears which pleasure and tenderness extorted from her she congratulated him on this singular and marvellous event  CHARLES thus crowned and anointed became more venerable in the eyes of all his subjects and seemed in a manner to receive anew from a heavenly commission his title to their allegiance The inclinations of men swaying their belief no one doubted of the inspirations and prophetic spirit of the Maid So many incidents which passed all human comprehension left little room to question a superior influence And the real and undoubted facts gave credit to every exaggeration which could scarce be rendered more wonderful Laon Soissons ChateauThierri Provins and many other towns and fortresses in that neighbourhood immediately after Charles's coronation submitted to him on the first summons and the whole nation was disposed to give him the most zealous testimonies of their duty and affection  Prudence of the duke of Bedford  NOTHING can impress us with a higher idea of the wisdom address and resolution of the duke of Bedford than his being able to maintain himself in so perilous a situation and to preserve some footing in France after the defection of so many places and amidst the universal inclination of the rest to imitate that contagious example This prince seemed present every where by his vigilance and foresight He employed each resource which fortune had yet left him He held all the English garrisons in a posture of defence He kept a watchful eye over every attempt among the French towards an insurrection He retained the Parisians in obedience by employing alternately caresses and severity And knowing that the duke of Burgundy was already wavering in his fidelity he acted with so much skill and prudence as to renew in this dangerous crisis an alliance which was so important to the credit and support of the English government  THE small supplies which he received from England set the talents of this great man in still a stronger light The ardour of the English for foreign conquests was now extremely abated by time and reflection The parliament seems even to have become sensible of the danger which might attend their farther progress No supply of money could be obtained by the regent during his greatest distresses and men inlisted slowly under his standard or soon deserted by reason of the wonderful accounts which had reached England of the magic and sorcery and diabolical power of the maid of Orleans  Rymer vol p  It happened fortunately in this emergency that the bishop of Winchester now created a cardinal landed at Calais with a body of men which he was conducting into Bohemia on a croisade against the Hussites He was persuaded to lend these troops to his nephew during the present difficulties  Rymer vol p  and the regent was thereby enabled to take the field and to oppose the French King who was advancing with his army to the gates of Paris  THE extraordinary capacity of the duke of Bedford appeared also in his military operations He attempted to restore the courage of his troops by boldly advancing to the face of the enemy but he chose his posts with so much caution as always to decline a combat and to render it impossible for Charles to attack him He still attended that prince in all his movements covered his own towns and garrisons and kept himself in a posture to reap advantage from every imprudence or false step of the enemy The French army which consisted mostly of voluntiers who served at their own expence soon after retired and was dissolved Charles went to Bourges the ordinary place of his residence but not  till he had made himself master of Compiegne Beauvais Senlis Sens Laval Lagni St Denis and of many places in the neighbourhood of Paris which the affections of the people had put into his hands  THE regent endeavoured to revive the declining state of his affairs by bringing over the young King of England and having him crowned and acknowledged King of France at Paris  Rymer vol p  All the vassals of the crown who lived within the provinces possessed by the English swore anew allegiance and did homage to him But this ceremony was cold and insipid in comparison of the eclat which had attended the coronation of Charles at Rheims and the duke of Bedford expected more effect from an accident which put into his hands the person who had been the author of all his calamities  THE maid of Orleans after the coronation of Charles declared to the count de Dunois that her wishes were now satisfied and that she had no farther desire than to return to her former condition and to the occupations and course of life which became her sex But that nobleman sensible of the mighty advantages which might still be reaped from her presence in the army exhorted her to persevere till by the final expulsion of the English she had brought all her prophecies to their full completion In pursuance of this advice she threw herself into the town of Compiegne which was at that time besieged by the duke of Burgundy assisted by the earls of Arundel and Suffolk and the garrison on her appearance believed themselves thenceforth invincible But their joy was of short duration  th May  The Maid next day after her arrival headed a sally upon the quarters of John de Luxembourg she twice drove the enemy from their entrenchments finding their numbers to encrease every moment she ordered a retreat when hard pressed by the pursuers she turned upon them and made them again recoll but being here deserted by her friends and surrounded by the enemy she was at last after exerting the utmost valour taken prisoner by the Burgundians  Stowe p  The common opinion was that the French officers finding the merit of every victory ascribed to her had in envy to her renown by which they themselves were so much eclipsed willingly exposed her to this fatal accident  THE envy of her friends on this occasion was not a greater proof of her merit than the triumph of her enem es A complete victory would not have given more joy to the English and their partizans The service of  te deum  which has so often been prophaned by princes was publickly celebrated on this fortunate event at Paris The duke of Bedford fancied that by the captivity of that extraordinary  woman who had blasted all his successes he would again recover his former ascendant over France and to push farther the present advantage he purchased the captive from John de Luxembourg and formed a prosecution against her which whether it proceeded from vengeance or policy was equally barbarious and dishonourable  THERE was no possible reason why Joan should not be regarded as a prisoner of war and be entitled to all the courtesy and good usage which civilized nations practise towards enemies on these occasions She had never in her military capacity forfeited by any act of treachery or cruelty her claim to that treatment She was unstained with any civil crime Even the virtues and the very decorums of her sex had ever been rigidly observed by her  We learn from her trial in Pasquier that when accused of having put to death Franquet d'Arras her prisoner she justified herself by saying that he was a known robber and lay under sentence of death by a civil magistrte She was so careful of observing decorums that when she was in any town or garrison she always went to bed with some women of character in the place When in the camp she lay in armour and always had one of her brothers on each side of her The English never reproached her with any thing in regard to her morals  And tho' her appearing in war and leading armies to battle may seem an exception she had thereby performed such signal service to her prince that she had abundantly compensated for this irregularity and was even on that very account the more an object of praise and admiration It was necessary therefore for the duke of Bedford to interest religion some way in the prosecution and to cover under that cloak his flagrant violation of justice and humanity  THE bishop of Beauvais a man wholly devoted to the English interest presented a petition against Joan on pretence that she was taken within the bounds of his diocese and he desired to have her tried by an ecclesiastical court for forcery impiety idolatry and magic The university of Paris was so mean as to join in the same request Several prelates among whom the cardinal of Winchester was the only Englishman were appointed her judges They held their court in Roüen where the young King of England then resided And the maid cloathed in her former military apparel but loaded with irons was produced before this tribunal  SHE first desired to be eased of her chains Her judges answered that she had once already attempted an escape by throwing herself from a tower She confessed the fact maintained the justice of her intention and owned that if she could she could still execute that purpose All her other speeches showed the same firmness and intrepidity Tho' harrassed with interrogatories during near the  course of four months she never betrayed any weakness or womanish submission and no advantage was gained over her The point which her judges pushed most vehemently was her visions and revelations and intercourse with departed saints and they asked her whether she would submit to the church the truth of these inspirations She replied that she would submit them to God the fountain of truth They then exclaimed that she was a heretic and denied the authority of the church She appealed to the Pope They rejected her appeal  THEY asked her why she put trust in her standard which had been consecrated by magical incantations She replied that she put trust in the Supreme Being alone whose image was impressed upon it They demanded why she carried in her hand that standard at the anointment and coronation of Charles at Rheims She answered that the person who had shared the danger was entitied to share the glory When accused of going to war contrary to the decorums of her sex and of assuming government and command over men she scrupled not to reply that her sole purpose was to defeat the English and to expel them from the kingdom of France In the issue she was condemned for all the crimes of which she had been accused aggravated by heresy her revelations were declared to be inventions of the devil to delude the people and she was sentenced to be delivered over to the secular arm  JOAN so long surrounded by inveterate enemies who treated her with every mark of contumely browbeaten and overawed by men of superior rank and men invested with the ensigns of a sacred character which she had been accustomed to revere felt her spirit at last subdued and those visionary dreams of inspiration in which she had been buoyed up by the triumphs of success and the applauses of her own party gave way to the terrors of that punishment to which she was sentenced She publickly declared herself willing to recant she acknowledged the illusion of those revelations which the church had rejected and she promised never more to maintain them Her sentence was then mitigated She was condemned to perpetual imprisonment and to be fed during life on bread and water  ENOUGH was now done to fulfill all political views and to convince both the French and the English that the opinion of divine influence which had so much encouraged the one and daunted the other was entirely without foundation But the barbarous vengeance of Joan's enemies was not satisfied with this victory Suspecting that the female dress which she had now consented to wear was disagreeable to her they purposely placed in her apartment a suit of man's apparel and watched for the effect of that temptation upon her On the sight of a dress in which she had acquired so much renown and which she once  believed she wore by the particular appointment of heaven all her former ideas and passions revived and she ventured in her solitude to cloath herself again in the sorbidden garment Her insidious enemies caught her in that situation Her fault was interpreted to be no less than a relapse into heresy No recantation would now suffice and no pardon could be granted her She was condemned to be burned in the market place of Roüen and the infamous sentence was accordingly  Execution of the maid of Orleans th June  executed This admirable heroine to whom the more generous superstition of the antients would have erected altars was on pretence of heresy and magic delivered over alive to the flames and expiated by that dreadful punishment the signal services which she had rendered to her prince and to her native country  THE affairs of the English far from being advanced by this execution went every day more and more to decay The great abilities of the regent were unable to resist the strong inclination which had seized the French to return under the obedience of their rightful sovereign and which that act of cruelty was ill fitted to remove Chartres was surprized by a stratagem of the count de Dunois A body of the English under lord Willoughby was defeated at St Celerin upon the Sarte  Monstrelet vol p  The fair in the suburbs of Caen seated in the midst of the English territories was pillaged by de Lore a French captain of reputation The duke of Bedford himself was obliged by Dunois to raise the siege of Lagni with some dishonour And all these misfortunes tho' light yet being continued and uninterrupted brought discredit to the English and menaced them with an approaching loss of all their conquests But the chief detriment which the regent sustained was by the death of his dutchess who had hitherto preserved some appearance of friendship between him and her brother the duke of Burgundy  Monstrelet vol p  And his marriage soon afterwards with Jaqueline of Luxembourg was the beginning of a breach between them  Stowe p Grafton p  Philip complained that the regent had never had the civility to inform him of his intentions and that so sudden a marriage was a slight on his sister's memory The cardinal of Winchester mediated a reconciliation between these princes and brought them both to St Omers for that purpose The duke of Bedford here expected the first visit both as he was son brother and uncle to a King and because he had already made such advances as to come into the duke of Burgundy's territories in order to have an interview with him But Philip proud of his great power and independant dominions refused to pay this compliment to the Regent And the two princes  unable to adjust the ceremonial parted without seeing each other  Monstrelet vol p Grafton p  A very bad prognostic of their cordial intentions to renew past friendship and amity  Defection of the duke of Burgundy  NOTHING could be more repugnant to the interests of the house of Burgundy than to unite the crowns of France and England on the same head an event which had it taken place would have reduced the duke to the rank of a petty prince and have rendered his situation entirely dependant and precarious The title also to the crown of France which after the failure of the elder branches might accrue to the duke or his posterity had been sacrificed by the treaty of Troye and strangers and enemies were thereby irrevocably fixed upon the throne Revenge alone had carried Philip into these impolitic measures and a point of honour had hitherto induced him to maintain them But as it is the nature of passion gradually to decay while the sense of interest maintains an eternal influence and authority the duke had for some years appeared sensibly to relent in his animosity against Charles and to hearken willingly to the apologies made by that prince for the murder of the late duke of Burgundy His extreme youth was pleaded in his favour his incapacity to judge for himself the ascendant gained over him by his ministers and his inability to resent a deed which without his knowledge had been perpetrated by those under whose guidance he was then placed The more to gratify the pride of Philip the King of France had banished from his court and presence Tanegui de Chatel and all those concerned in that assassination and had offered to make any other atonement which could be required of him The ills which Charles had already suffered had tended to gratify the duke's revenge the miseries to which France had been so long exposed had begun to move his compassion and the cries of all Europe admonished him that his resentment which might hitherto be deemed pious would if carried farther be universally condemned as barbarous and unrelenting While the duke was in this disposition every disgust which he received from England made a double impression upon him the entreaties of the count de Richement and the duke of Bourbon who had married his two sisters had weight and he determined finally to unite himself to the royal family of France from which his own was descended  For this purpose a congress was appointed at Arras under the mediation of deputies from the Pope and the council of Basle The duke of Burgundy came thither in person The duke of Bourbon the count de Richemont and other persons of high rank appeared as ambassadors from France And the English having also been invited to attend the cardinal of Winchester the archbishop of York and others received from the protector and council a commission for that purpose  Monstrelet vol p    August  THE conferences were held in the Abbey of St Vaast and began with discussing the proposals of the two crowns which were so wide of each other as to admit of no hopes of accommodation England offered that each party should remain in possession of what they had at present after making some equal exchanges for mutual convenience France offered to cede Normandy with Guienne but both of them loaded with the usual homage and vassalage to the crown As the claims of England upon France were universally unpopular in Europe the mediators declared the offers of Charles very reasonable and the cardinal of Winchester with the English ambassadors immediately left the congress There remained nothing but to discuss the mutual pretensions of Charles and Philip These were easily adjusted The vassal was in a situation to give law to his superior and he exacted conditions which had it not been for the present necessity would have been deemed to the last degree dishonourable and disadvantageous to the crown of France Besides making repeated atonements and acknowledgements for the murder of the duke of Burgundy Charles was obliged to cede all the towns of Picardy which lay between the Somme and the Low Countries he yielded several other territories he agreed that these and all the other dominions of Philip should be held by him during his lifetime without doing any homage or swearing fealty to the present King and he freed his subjects from all obligations to allegiance if ever he infringed this treaty  Monstrelet vol p Grafton p  Such were the conditions upon which France purchased the friendship of the duke of Burgundy  THE duke sent over a herald to England with a letter in which he notified the conclusion of the treaty of Arras and apologized for his departure from that of Troye The council received the herald with great coldness They even assigned him his lodgings in a shoemaker's house by way of insult and the populace were so incensed that if the duke of Glocester had not given him guards his life would have been exposed to danger when he appeared in the streets The Flemings and other subjects of Philip were insulted and some of them murdered by the Londoners and every thing seemed to tend towards a rupture between the two nations  Monstrelet vol p Holingshed p  These violences were not disagreeable to the duke of Burgundy as they afforded him a pretence for the farther measures which he intended to take against the English whom he now regarded as implacable and dangerous enemies  th Septr Death of the duke of Bedford  A few days after the duke of Bedford received intelligence of this treaty so fatal to the interests of England he died at Roüen a prince of great abilities and of many virtues and whose memory except from the barbarous  execution of the maid of Orleans was unsullied by any considerable blemish Isabella Queen of France died a little before him despised by the English detested by the French and reduced in her latter years to regard with an unnatural horror the progress and successes of her own son in recovering possession of his kingdom This period was also signalized by the death of the earl of Arundel  Monstrelet vol p  Holingshed p  a great English general who tho' he commanded three thousand men was fo led by Xaintrailles at the head of six hundred and soon after expired of the wounds which he received in the action  THE violent factions which prevailed in the court of England between the duke of Glocester and the cardinal of Winchester prevented the English from taking the proper measures for repairing these multiplied losses and threw all their affairs into confusion The popularity of the duke and his near relation to the crown gave him advantages in the contest which he often lost by his open and unguarded temper unfit to struggle with the politic and interested spirit of his rival The balance meanwhile of these parties kept every thing in suspence Foreign affairs were much neglected And tho' the duke of York son to that earl of Cambridge who was executed in the beginning of the last reign was appointed successor to the duke of Bedford it was seven months before his commission passed the seals and the English remained so long in an enemy's country without a proper head or governor  Decline of the English in France  THE new governor on his arrival found the capital already lost The Parisians had always been more attached to the Burgundian than to the English interest and after the conclusion of the treaty of Arras their affections without any farther controul universally led them to return to their allegiance under their native sovereign The constable together with LileAdam the same person who had before put Paris into the hands of the duke of Burgundy was introduced in the night time by intelligence with the citizens The lord Willoughby who commanded only a small garrison of men was expelled That nobleman discovered great valour and presence of mind on the occasion but unable to guard so large a place against such multitudes he retired into the Bastile and being there invested delivered up the place and was contented to stipulate for the safe retreat of his troops into Normandy  Monstrelet vol p Grafton p      IN the same season the duke of Burgundy took openly part against England and commenced hostilities by the siege of Calais the only place which now gave the English any sure hold of France and still rendered them dangerous As he  was beloved among his own subjects and had acquired the epithet of  Good  from his popular qualities he was able to interest all the inhabitants of the Lowcountries in the success of this enterprize and he invested that place with an army very formidable from its numbers but without experience discipline or military spirit  Monstrelet vol p Holingshed p Grafton p  On the first alarm of this siege the duke of Glocester assembled some forces sent a defiance to Philip and challenged him to wait the event of a battle which he promised to give as soon as the wind would permit him to reach Calais The warlike genius of the English had at that time rendered them terrible to all the northern parts of Europe much more to the Flemings who were more expert in manufactures than in arms  th June  and the duke of Burgundy being already foiled in some attempts before Calais and observing the discontent and terror of his own army thought proper to raise the siege and to retreat into his own territories before the arrival of the enemy  Monstrelet vol p Holingshed p    THE English were still masters of many fine provinces in France but retained possession more by the extreme weakness of Charles than by the strength of their own garrisons or the force of their armies Nothing indeed can be more surprizing than the feeble efforts made during the course of several years by these two potent nations against each other while the one struggled for independancy and the other aspired to a total conquest of its rival The general want of industry commerce and police in that age had rendered all the European nations and France and England no less than the others unfit for bearing the burthens of war when it was prolonged beyond one season and the continuance of hostilities had long ere this time exhausted the force and patience of both these kingdoms Scarce could the appearance of an army be brought into the field on either side and all the operations consisted in the surprize of places in the rencounter of detached parties and in incursions upon the open country which were performed by small bodies assembled on a sudden from the neighbouring garrisons In this method of conducting the war the French King had much the advantage The affections of the people were entirely on his side Intelligence was early brought him of the state and motions of the enemy The inhabitants were ready to join in any attempts against the garrisons And thus ground was continually tho' slowly gained against the English The duke of York who was a prince of ability struggled against these difficulties during the course of five years and being assisted by the valour of lord Talbot soon after created earl of Shrewsbury he performed actions which acquired him honour but merit not the attention of posterity It would have been well had this feeble war in sparing the blood of  the people prevented likewise all other oppressions and had the fury of men which reason and justice cannot restrain thus happily received a check from their impotence and inability But the French and English tho' they exerted such small force were however stretching beyond their resources which were still smaller and the troops destitute of pay were obliged to subsist by plundering and oppressing the country both of friends and enemies The fields in all the north of France which was the scene of war were laid waste and left uncultivated  Grafton p  The cities were gradually depopulated not by the blood spilt in war but by the more destructive pillage of the garrisons  And both parties weary of hostilities which decided nothing seemed at last desirous of peace and they set on foot negotiations for that purpose But the proposals which came from France and from England were still so wide of each other that all hopes of accommodation immediately vanished The English ambassadors demanded restitution of all the provinces which had once been annexed to England together with the final cession of Calais and its district and required the possession of these extensive territories without the burthen of any fealty or homage on the part of their prince The French offered only part of Guienne part of Normandy and Calais loaded with the usual burthens It appeared in vain to continue the negociation while there was so little prospect of agreement The English were still too haughty to stoop from the vast hopes which they had formerly entertained and to accept of terms more suitable to the present condition of the two kingdoms  THE duke of York soon after resigned his government to the earl of Warwic a nobleman of reputation whom death prevented from a long enjoyment of his dignity The duke upon the demise of this nobleman returned to his charge and during his administration a truce was concluded between the King of England and the duke of Burgundy which had become necessary for the commercial interest of their subjects  Grafton p  The war with France continued in the same languid and feeble state as before  THE captivity of five princes of the blood taken prisoners in the battle of Azincour was a considerable advantage which England long enjoyed above its enemy but this superiority was now entirely lost Some of these princes had died some had been ransomed for sums of money and the duke of Orleans the most powerful among them was the last who remained in the hands of the English He offered the sum of nobles  Rymer vol p This sum was equal to pounds sterling of our present money A subsidy of a tenth and fift  was fixed by Edward III at pounds that is of our present money The parliament granted only one subsidy during the course of seven years from to  for his liberty and when  this proposal was laid before the council of England as every question was there an object of faction the party of the duke of Glocester and that of the cardinal of Winchester were divided in their sentiments with regard to it The duke reminded the council of the dying advice of the late King that none of these prisoners should on any account be released till his son was of sufficient age to hold himself the reins of government The cardinal insisted on the greatness of the sum profered which in reality was near equal to two thirds of all the extraordinary supplies that the parliament during the course of seven years grante l for the support of the war And he added that the release of this prince was more likely to be advantageous than prejudicial to the English interests by filling the court of France with faction and giving a head to those numerous malecontents whom Charles was at present able with great difficulty to restrain The cardinal's party as usual prevailed The duke of Orleans was released after a melancholy captivity of twentyfive years  Grafton p  And the duke of Burgundy as a pledge of his entire reconciliation with the family of Orleans facilitated to that prince the payment of his ransom It must be confessed that the princes and nobility in those ages went to war on very disadvantageous terms If they were taken prisoners they either remained in captivity during life or purchased their liberty at the price which the victors were pleased to impose and which often reduced their families to beggary and want  THE sentiments of the cardinal some time after prevailed in another point of still greater moment That prelate had always encouraged every proposal of accommodation with France and had represented the utter impossibility in the present circumstances of pushing father the conquests in that kingdom and the great difficulty of even maintaining those which were already made He insisted on the extreme reluctance of the parliament to grant supplies the disorders in which the English affairs in Normandy were involved the daily progress made by the French King and the advantage of stopping his hand by a temporary accommodation which might leave room for time and accidents to operate in favour of the English The duke of Glocester high spirited and haughty and educated in the losty pretensions which the first successes of his two brothers had rendered familiar to him could not yet be induced to relinquish all hopes of prevailing over France much less could he see with patience his own opinion thwarted and rejected by the influence of his rival in the English council But notwithstanding his opposition the earl of Suffolk a nobleman who always adhered to the cardinal's party was dispatched to Tours in order to negotiate with  the French ministers  May Truce with F    It was found impossible to adjust the terms of a lasting peace but a truce for twentytwo months was concluded which left every thing on the present footing between the parties The numerous disorders under which the French government laboured and which time alone could remedy induced Charles to assent to this truce and the same motives engaged him afterwards to prolong it  Rymer vol  p      But Suffolk not content wi  h executing this object of his commission proceeded also to finish another business which seems rather to have been implied than included in the powers which had been granted him  Rymer vol p    IN proportion as Henry advanced in years his character became fully known in the court and was no longer ambiguous to either faction Of the most harmless inoffensive simple manners but of the most slender capacity he was fitted both by the softness of his temper and the weakness of his understanding to be perpetually governed by those who surrounded him and it was easy to foresee that h s reign would prove a perpetual minority As he had now reached the twentythird year of his age it was natural to think of choosing him a queen and each party was ambitious of having him receive one from their hand as it was probable that this circumstance would decide forever the victory between them The duke of Glocester proposed a daughter of the count d'Armagnac but had not credit to effectuate his purpose The cardinal and his friends had cast their eye on Margaret of Anjou daughter of Regnier titular King of Sicily Naples and Jerusalem descended from the count of Anjou brother of Charles V who had left these magnificent titles but without any real power or possessions to his posterity This princess herself was the most accomplished of her age both in body and mind and seemed to possess those qualities which would equally qualify her to acquire the ascendant over Henry and to supply all his defects and weaknesses Of a masculine courageous spirit of an enterprizing temper endowed with solidity as well as vivacity of understanding she had not been able to conceal these great talents even in the privacy of her father's family and it was reasonable to expect that when she should mount the throne they would break out with still superior lustre The earl of Suffolk therefore in concert with his associates of the English council made proposals of marriage to Margaret which were accepted But this nobleman besides preoccupying Margaret's favour by being the chief means of her advancement endeavoured to ingratiate himself with her and her family by very extraordinary concessions  Marriage of the King with Margaret of Anjou  Tho' the princess brought no dowry with her he ventured of himself without any direct authority from the council but probably with the allowance of the cardinal and the ruling members to engage by a secret article that the province of Maine which was at that  time in the hands of the English should be delivered up to Charles of Anjou her uncle  Grafton p  who was prime minister and favorite of the French King and who had already received from his master the grant of that province as his appanage  THE treaty of marriage was ratified in England Suffolk obtained first the title of marquis then that of duke and even received the thanks of parliament for his services in concluding it  Cotton p  The princess fell immediately into close connexions with the cardinal and his party the dukes of Somerset Suffolk and Buckingham  Holingshed p    who fortified by her powerful friendship resolved on the final ruin of the duke of Glocester  THIS generous prince worsted in all court intrigues for which his temper was not suited but possessing in a high degree the favour of the public had already received from his rivals a most cruel mortification which he had hitherto born patiently but which it was impossible that a person of his spirit and humanity could ever forgive His dutchess the daughter of Reginald lord Cobham had been accused of the crime of witchcraft and it was pretended that a waxen figure of the King was found in her possession which she and her associates sir Roger Bolingbroke a priest and one Margery Jordan of Eye melted in a magical manner before a slow fire with an intention of making Henry's force and vigour waste away by like insensible degrees The accusation was well calculated to affect the weak and credulous mind of the King and to gain belief in an ignorant age and the dutchess was brought to trial with her confederates The nature of this crime so opposite to all common sense seems always to exempt the accusers from observing the rules of common sense in their evidence The prisoners were pronounced guilty the dutchess was condemned to do public penance and to suffer perpetual imprisonment and the others were executed  Stowe p Holingshed p Grafton p  But as these violent proceedings were ascribed solely to the malice of the duke's enemies the people contrary to their usual practice on such occasions acquitted the unhappy sufferers and encreased their esteem and affection towards a prince who was thus exposed without protection to such mortal injuries  THESE sentiments of the public made the cardinal of Winchester and his party sensible that it was necessary to destroy a man whose popularity might become dangerous and whose resentment they had so much cause to apprehend In order to effectuate their purpose a parliament was summoned to meet not at London which was supposed to be too well affected to the duke but at St Edmondsbury where they expected that he would lie entirely at mercy As soon  as he appeared he was accused of treason and thrown into prison He was soon after found dead in his bed  Grafton p    th Feb  and tho' it was pretended that his death was natural and tho' his body which was exposed to public view bore no marks of outward injury no one doubted that he had fallen a sacrifice to the vengeance of his enemies  Murder of the duke of Glocester  A trick formerly practised on Edward II on Richard II and on Thomas of Woodstock duke of Glocester could deceive no body The reason of this violence seems not that the ruling party apprehended his acquital in parliament on account of his innocence which in such times was seldom much regarded but that they imagined his public trial and execution would have been more invidious than his private murder which they pretended to deny Some gentlemen of his retinue were afterwards tried for aiding him in his treasons and were condemned to be hanged drawn and quartered They were hanged and cut down but just as the executioner was proceeding to quarter them their pardon was produced and they were recovered to life  Fabian Chron anno  The most barbarous kind of mercy that can possibly be imagined  THIS prince is said to have received a more learned education than was usual in his age to have founded one of the first public libraries in England and to have been a great patron of learned men Among other advantages which he reaped from this turn of mind it tended much to cure him of credulity of which the following instance is given by Sir Thomas More There was a man who pretended that tho' he was born blind he had recovered his sight by touching the shrine of St Albans The duke happening soon after to pass that way questioned the man and seeming to doubt of his sight asked him the colour of several cloaks worn by persons in his retinue The man told him very readily  You are a knave  cried the prince  had you been born blind you could not have distinguished colours  And immediately ordered him to be put in the stocks as an impostor  Grafton p    THE cardinal of Winchester died six weeks after his nephew whose murder was universally ascribed to him as well as to the duke of Suffolk and which it is said gave him more remorse in his last moments than could naturally be expected from a man hardened during the course of a long life in falshood and in politics What share the Queen had in this guilt is uncertain her usual activity and spirit made the public conclude with some reason that the duke's enemies durst not have ventured on such a deed without her privity But there happened soon after an event of which she and her favourite the duke of Suffolk bore uncontestably the whole odium  THAT article of the marriage treaty by which the province of Maine was to be yielded to Charles of Anjou the Queen's uncle had probably been hitherto kept a secret and during the lifetime of the duke of Glocester it would have been dangerous to venture on the execution of it But as the court of France insisted strenuously on performance orders were now dispatched under Henry's hand to Sir Francis Surienne governor of Mans commanding him to surrender that place to Charles of Anjou Surienne either questioning the authenticity of the order or regarding his government as his only fortune refused compliance and it became necessary for a French army under the count de Dunois to lay siege to the city The governor made as good a defence as his situation could permit but receiving no relief from Edmund duke of Somerset who was at that time governor of Normandy he was at last obliged to capitulate and to surrender not only Mans but all the other fortresses of that province which was thus entirely alienated from the crown of England  THE bad effects of this measure stopped not here Surienne at the head of all his garrisons amounting to men retired into Normandy in expectation of being taken into pay and of being quartered in some towns of that province But Somerset who had no means of subsisting such a multitude and who was probably incensed at Surienne's disobedience refused to admit him and this adventurer not daring to commit depredations on the territories either of the King of France or of England marched into Brittany seized the town of Fougeres repaired the fortifications of Pontorson and St James de Beuvron and subsisted his troops by the ravages which he committed on all that province  Monstrelet vol p  The duke of Brittany complained of this violence to the King of France his liege lord Charles remonstrated with the duke of Somerset That nobleman replied that the injury was done without his privity and that he had no authority over Surienne and his companions  Monstrelet vol p Hollingshed p  Tho' this answer might appear very satisfactory to Charles who had often felt severely the licentious independant spirit of such mercenary soldiers he never would admit the apology He still insisted that these plunderers should be recalled and that reparation should be made to the duke of Brittany for all the damages which they had committed And in order to render an accommodation absolutely impracticable he made the estimation of damages amount to no less a sum than crowns He was sensible of the superiority which the present state of his affairs gave him over England and he determined to take advantage of it  State of France  NO sooner was the truce concluded between the two kingdoms than Charles employed himself with great industry and judgment in repairing those numberless ills to which France from the continuance of wars both foreign and domestic had so long been exposed He restored the course of public justice he introduced order into the finances he established discipline in his troops he repressed faction in his court he revived the languid state of agriculture and the arts and in the course of a few years he rendered his kingdom flourishing within itself and formidable to all its neighbours Mean while affairs in England had taken a very different turn The court was divided into parties which were enraged against each other The people were discontented with the government Conquests in France which were an object more of glory than of interest were overlooked amidst domestic incidents which engrossed all mens attention The governor of Normandy ill supplied with money was obliged to dismiss the greater part of his troops and to allow the fortifications of the towns and castles to fall into disrepair And the nobility and people of that province had during the open communication with France enjoyed frequent opportunities of renewing connexions with their antient master and of concerting the means for expelling the English  Renewal of the war with France  The occasion therefore seemed favourable to Charles for breaking the truce and Normandy was at once invaded by four powerful armies one commanded by the King himself a second by the duke of Brittany a third by the duke of Alençon and a fourth by the count de Dunois The places opened their gates almost as soon as the French appeared before them Verneüil Nogent Chateau Gaillard Ponteau de mer Gisors Mante Vernon Argentan Lisieux Fecamp Coutances Belesme Pont de l'Arche fell in an instant into the hands of the enemy The duke of Somerset so far from having an army which could take the field and relieve these places was not able to supply them with the necessary garrisons and provisions He retired with the few troops of which he was master into Roüen and thought it sufficient if till the arrival of succours from England he could save that capital from the general fate of the province The King of France at the head of a formidable army fifty thousand strong presented himself before the gates The dangerous example of revolt had infected the inhabitants and they called aloud for a capitulation Somerset unable to resist at once both the enemies within and from without retired with his garrison into the palace and castle which being places not tenable he was obliged to surrender  He purchased a retreat to Harfleur by the payment of crowns by engaging to surrender Arques Tancarville Caudebec Honfleur and other places in the higher Normandy and by delivering  hostages for the performance of these articles  Monstrelet vol p Grafton p    The governor of Honfleur refused to obey his orders upon which the earl of Shrewsbury who was one of the hostages was detained prisoner and the English were thus deprived of the only general capable of recovering them from their present distressed situation Harfleur made a better defence under Sir Thomas Curson the governor but was finally obliged to open its gates to the count de Dunois Succours at last appeared from England under Sir Thomas Kyriel and landed at Cherbourg But these came very late amounted only to men and were soon after put to rout at Fourmigni by the count de Clermont  Holingshed p  This battle or rather skirmish was the only action sought by the English for the defence of their dominions in France which they had purchased at such an expence of blood and treasure Somerset shut up in Caen without any prospect of relief found it necessary to capitulate Falaise opened its gates on condition that the earl of Shrewsbury should be restored to liberty And Cherbourg the last place of Normandy which remained in the hands of the English being delivered up the conquest of that important province was finished in a twelvemonth by Charles to the infinite joy of the inhabitants and of his whole kingdom  Grafton p    A LIKE rapid success attended the French arms in Guienne tho' the inhabitants of that province were from long custom better inclined to the English government The count de Dunois was dispatched thither and met with no resistance in the field and very little from the towns  The English expelled France  Great improvements had been made during this age in the structure and management of artillery and none in fortification and the art of defence was by that means more unequal than either before or since to the art of attack After all the small places about Bourdeaux were reduced that city agreed to submit if not relieved by a certain time and as no one in England thought seriously of these distant concerns no relief appeared the place surrendered and Bayonne being taken soon after this whole province which had remained united to England since the accession of Henry II was after a period of three centuries finally swallowed up by the French monarchy  THO' no peace nor truce was concluded between France and England the war was in a manner at an end The English torn in pieces by the civil dissensions which ensued made but one feeble effort more for the recovery of Guienne And Charles occupied at home in regulating the government and fencing  against the intrigues of his factious son Lewis the Dauphin scarce ever attempted to invade them in their island or to retaliate upon them by availing himself of their inrestine confusions  CHAP XXI HENRY VI  Claim of the duke of York to

AlbansBattle of Bloreheathof NorthamptonA parliamentBattle of WakefieldDeath of the duke of YorkBattle of Mortimer's CrossSecond Battle of St AlbansEdward IV assumes the crownMiscellaneous transactions of this reign  A WEAK prince seated on the throne of England had never failed however gentle and innocent to be infested with faction discontent rebellion and civil commotions and as the incapacity of Henry appeared every day in a fuller light these dangerous consequences began from past experience to be universally and justly apprehended Men also of unquiet spirits no longer employed in foreign wars whence they were now excluded by the situation of the neighbouring states were the more likely to excite intestine disorders and by their emulation rivalship and animosities to tear the bowels of their native country But tho' these causes alone were sufficient to breed confusion there concurred another circumstance of the most dangerous nature A pretender to the crown appeared The title itself of the weak prince who enjoyed the name of sovereignty was disputed And the English were now to pay the severe tho' late penalty of their turbulence against Richard II and of their levity in violating without any necessity or just reason the lineal succession of their monarchs  Claim of the duke of York to the crown  ALL the males of the house of Mortimer were extinct but Anne the sister of the last earl of Marche having espoused the earl of Cambridge beheaded in the reign of Henry V had transmitted her latent but not yet forgotten claim to her son Richard duke of York This prince thus descended by his mother from Philippa only daughter of the duke of Clarence second son of Edward III stood plainly in the order of succession before the King who derived his descent from the duke of Lancaster third son of that monarch and that claim could not in many respects have fallen into more dangerous hands than those of the duke of York Richard was a man of valour and abilities of a prudent conduct and mild dispositions He had enjoyed an opportunity of displaying these virtues in his government of France And tho' recalled from that command by the intrigues and superior interest of the duke of Somerset he had been sent to suppress a rebellion in Ireland had succeeded much better in that enterprize than his rival in the defence of Normandy and had even been able to attach to his person and family the whole Irish nation whom he was sent to subdue  Stowe p  In the right of his father he bore the rank of first prince of the blood and by this station he gave a lustre to his title derived from the family of Mortimer which tho' of great nobility was equaled by other families in the kingdom and had been eclipsed by the royal descent of the house of Lancaster He possessed an immense fortune from the union of so many successions those of Cambridge and York on the one hand with those of Mortimer on the other Which last inheritance had before been augmented by an union of the estates of Clarence and Ulster with the patrimonial possessions of the family of Marche The alliances too of Richard in marrying the daughter of Ralph Nevil earl of Westmoreland had very widely extended his interest among the nobility and had procured him many connexions in that formidable order  THE family of Nevil was perhaps at this time the most potent both from their opulent possessions and from the characters of the men that has ever appeared in England For besides the earl of Westmoreland the lords Latimer Fauconbridge and Abergavenny the earls of Salisbury and Warwic were of that family and were of themselves on many accounts the greatest noblemen of the kingdom The earl of Salisbury brother in law to the duke of York was the eldest son by a second marriage of the earl of Westmoreland and inherited by his wife daughter and heir of Montacute earl of Salisbury killed before Orleans the possessions and title of that great family His eldest son Richard had married Anne the daughter and heir of Beauchamp earl of Warwic who died governor of France and by that alliance he enjoyed the possessions and had  acquired the title of that other family one of the most opulent most antient and most illustrious of the kingdom  The earl of Warwic  The personal qualities also of these two earls especially of Warwic enhanced the splendor of their nobility and encreased their influence over the people This latter nobleman commonly known from the subsequent events by the appellation of the  Kingmaker  had distinguished himself by his gallantry in the field by the hospitality of his table by the magnificence and still more by the generosity of his expence and by the spirited and bold manner which attended him in all his actions The undesigning frankness and openness of his character rendered his conquest over mens affections the more certain and infallible His presents were regarded as sure testimonies of esteem and friendship and his professions as the overflowings of his genuine sentiments No less than people are said to have daily lived at his board in the different manors and castles which he possessed in England The military men allured by his munificence and hospitality as well as by his bravery were zealously attached to his interests The people in general bore him an unlimited affection His numerous retainers were more devoted to his will than to the prince or to the laws And he was the greatest as well as the last of those mighty barons who formerly overawed the Crown and rendered the people incapable of any regular system of civil government  BUT the duke of York besides the family of Nevil had many other partizans among the great nobility Courtney earl of Devonshire descended from the royal blood of France was attached to his interests Moubray duke of Norfolk from his hereditary hatred to the family of Lancaster had embraced the same party And the discontents which universally prevailed among the people rendered every combination of the great the more dangerous to the established government  THO' the people were never willing to grant the supplies necessary for keeping possession of the conquered provinces in France they repined extremely at the loss of these boasted acquisitions and fancied because a sudden irruption could make conquests that without steddy counsels and an uniform expence it was possible to maintain them The voluntary cession of Maine to the queen's uncle had made them suspect treachery in the loss of Normandy and Guienne They still considered Margaret as a French woman and a latent enemy of the kingdom And when they saw her father and all her relations active in promoting the success of the French they could not be persuaded that she who was all powerful in the English council would very zealously oppose them in their enterprizes  BUT the most fatal blow which was given to the popularity of the crown and to the interests of the house of Lancaster was by the assassination of the virtuous duke of Glocester whose character had he been alive would have kept in awe the partizans of York but whose memory being extremely cherished by the people served to throw an infinite odium on all his murderers By this event the reigning family suffered a double prejudice It was deprived of its firmest support and it was loaded with all the infamy of that imprudent and barbarous execution  As the duke of Suffolk was known to have had an active hand in this crime he partook deeply of the hatred which attended it and the clamours which necessarily rose against him as prime minister and declared favourite of the queen were thereby augmented to a tenfold pitch and became absolutely uncontroleable The great nobility could ill brook to see a subject exalted above them much more one who was only great grandson to a merchant and who was of a birth so much inferior to theirs The people complained of his arbitrary measures which were in some degree a necessary consequence of the irregular power then possessed by the prince but which the least disaffection easily magnified into tyranny The immense acquisitions which he daily made were the object of envy and as they were made at the expence of the crown which was itself reduced to the most scandalous poverty they appeared on that account to all indifferent persons the more exceptionable and invidious  THE revenues of the crown which had long been disproportioned to its power and dignity had been extremely dilapidated during the minority of Henry  Cotton p  both by the rapacity of the courtiers which the King's uncles could not controul and by the necessary expences of the French war which had always been so ill supplied by the grants of parliament The royal demesnes were dissipated and at the same time the King was loaded with a debt of pounds a sum so immense that the parliament could never think of discharging it This unhappy situation forced the ministers upon many arbitrary measures The household itself could not be supported without stretching to the utmost the right of purveyance and rendering it a kind of universal robbery upon the people The public clamour rose high upon this occasion and no one had the equity to make allowance for the necessity of the King's situation Suffolk once become odious bore the blame of the whole and every grievance in every part of the administration was universally imputed to his tyranny and injustice  Impeachment of the duke of Suffolk  THIS nobleman sensible of the public hatred under which he laboured and forseeing an attack from the commons endeavoured to overawe his enemies by boldly presenting himself to the charge and by insisting upon his own innocence and even upon his merits and those of his family in the public service He rose up in the house of peers took notice of the clamours propagated against him and complained that after serving the crown in thirty four campaigns after staying abroad seventeen years without once returning to his own country after losing a father and three brothers in the wars with France after being himself a prisoner and purchasing his liberty by a large ransom it should yet be suspected that he had been debauched from his allegiance by that enemy whom he had ever opposed with such zeal and fortitude and that he had betrayed his prince who had rewarded his services by the highest honours and greatest offices which it was in his power to confer  Cotton p  This speech did not answer the purpose intended The commons rather the more provoked at his challenge opened their charge against Suffolk and sent up to the house of peers an accusation of high treason divided into several articles They insisted that he had persuaded the French King to invade England with an armed force in order to depose the King to place on the throne his own son John de la Pole whom he intended to marry to Margaret the only daughter of the late John duke of Somerset and to whom he imagined he would by that means acquire a title to the crown That he had contributed to the release of the duke of Orleans in hopes that that prince would aid and assist King Charles in expelling the English from France and recovering full possession of his kingdom That he had afterwards encouraged that King to make open war on Normandy and Guienne and had promoted his conquests by betraying the secrets of England and obstructing the succours proposed to be sent over to those provinces And that he had without any powers or commission promised by treaty to deliver up the provinces of Maine to Charles of Anjou and had accordingly delivered it up a concession which proved in the issue the chief cause of the loss of Normandy  Cotton p Hall fol Holingshed p Grafton p    IT is evident from a review of these articles that the commons adopted without enquiry all the popular clamours against the duke of Suffolk and charged him with crimes of which none but the vulgar could seriously believe him guilty Nothing can be more incredible than that a nobleman of his rank and character could think of acquiring the crown to his family and of deposing Henry by foreign force and together with him Margaret his patron a princess of so much spirit and penetration Suffolk appealed to many noblemen in the house  who knew that he had intended to marry his son to one of the coheirs of the earl of Warwic and was disappointed in his design only by the death of that lady And he observed that Margaret of Somerset could bring to her husband no title to the crown because she herself was not so much as comprehended in the entail settled by act of parliament It is easy to account for the loss of Normandy and Guienne from the situation of affairs in the two kingdoms without supposing any treachery in the English ministers and it may safely be affirmed that greater vigour of council was requisite to defend them from the arms of Charles VII than to conquer them at first from his predecessor It could never be the interest of any English minister to betray and abandon these provinces much less of one who was so well established in his master's favour who enjoyed such high honours and ample possessions in his own country who had nothing to dread but the effects of popular hatred and who could never think without the most extreme reluctance of becoming a fugitive and exile in a foreign land The only article which carries any face of probability is his engagement for the delivery of Maine to Charles of Anjou but Suffolk maintained with great appearance of truth that this measure was known and consented to by several at the council board  Cotton p  and it seems hard to ascribe to it as is done by the parliament the subsequent loss of Normandy and expulsion of the English Normandy lay open on every side to the invasion of the French Maine an inland province must soon after have fallen without any attack And as the English possessed in other parts more fortresses than they could garrison or provide for it seemed no bad policy to contract their force and to render the defence practicable by reducing it into smaller compass  THE commons were probably sensible that this charge of treason against Suffolk would not bear a strict scrutiny and they therefore sent up soon after a new charge of misdemeanours which they also divided into several articles They affirmed among other imputations that he had procured exorbitant grants from the crown had embezzled the public money had conferred offices on improper persons had perverted justice by maintaining iniquitous causes and had procured pardons to notorious offenders  Cotton p  The articles are mostly general but are not improbable And as Suffolk seems to have been a bad man and a bad minister it will not be rash in us to think that he was guilty and that many of these articles could have been proved against him The court was alarmed at the prosecution of a favourite minister who lay under such a load of popular prejudices and an expedient was fallen upon to save him from present ruin The King sent for all the lords spiritual and temporal to his apartment The prisoner  was produced before them and asked what he could say in his own defence He denied the charge but submitted to the King's mercy Henry expressed himself not to be satisfied with regard to the first bill of treasons  H  ban  hment  b  t in consideration of the second of misdemeanors he declared that by virtue of Suffolk's own submission not by any judicial authority he banished him the kingdom during five years The lords remained silent but so soon as they returned to their own house they entered a protest that this sentence should no wise infringe their privileges and that if Suffolk had insisted upon his right and had not submitted voluntarily to the King's orders he was intitled to a trial by his peers in parliment  IT was easy to see that these irregular proceedings were meant to favour Suffolk and that as he still possessed the Queen's confidence he would on the first favourable opportunity be restored to his country and be reinstated in his former power and credit A captain of a vessel was therefore employed by his enemies to intercept him in his passage to France  and death  He was seized near Dover his head struck off on the side of a long boat and his body thrown into the sea  Hall fol Hist Croyland contin p Stowe p Grafton p  No enquiry was made after the authors and accomplices of this atrocious act of violence  THE duke of Somerset succeeded to Suffolk's power in the ministry and credit with the Queen and as he was the person in whose hands the French provinces were lost the public who judge always by the event soon made him equally the object of their animosity and hatred The duke of York was absent in Ireland during all these transactions and however it might be suspected that his partizans had excited and supported the prosecution of Suffolk no immediate ground of complaint could on that account he against him But there happened soon after an incident which rouzed the jealousy of the court and discovered to them the extreme danger to which they were exposed from the pretensions of that wise and popular prince  THE humours of the people set afloat by the parliamentary impeachment and by the fall of so great a favourite as Suffolk broke out in various commotions which were soon suppressed but there arose one in Kent which was likely to have been attended with more dangerous consequences A man of low condition one John Cade a native of Ireland who had been obliged to fly into France for his crimes observed on his return the discontents of the people and he laid on them the foundation of projects which were at first attended with surprizing success He took the name of John Mortimer intending as is supposed to pass himself for a son of that sir John Mortimer who had been sentenced to death by  parliament and executed in the beginning of this reign without any trial or evidence merely upon an indictment of high treason given in against him  Stowe p Cotton p This author admires that such a piece of injustice should have been committed in peaceable times He might have added and by such virtuous princes as Bedford and Glocester But it is to be presumed that Mortimer was guilty tho' his condemnation was highly irregular and illegal The people had at this time a very seeble sense of law and a constitution and power was very imperfectly restrained by these limits When the proceedings of a parliament were so irregular it is easy to imagine that those of a king would be more so  On the first mention of that popular name the common people of Kent to the number of flocked to Cade's standard and he excited their zeal by publishing complaints against the numerous abuses of government and demanding redress of their grievances The court not yet fully sensible of the danger sent a small force against the rioters under the command of sir Humphrey Stafford who was defeated and slain in an action near Sevenoke  Hall fol Holingshed p  and Cade advancing with his followers towards London encamped on Blackheath Tho' elated by his victory he still maintained the appearance of moderation and sending the court a very plausible list of grievances  Stowe p Holingshed p  he promised that when these were redressed and when lord Say the treasurer and Cromer high sheriff of Kent were punished for their malversations he would immediately lay down his arms The council who observed that nobody was willing to fight against men so reasonable in their pretensions carried the King for present safety to Kenilworth and the city immediately opened their gates to Cade who maintained during some time great order and discipline among his followers He always led them out into the fields during the nighttime and published severe edicts against plunder and violence of every kind But being obliged in order to gratify their malevolence against Say and Cromer to put these ministers to death without a legal trial  Grafton p  he found that after the commission of this crime he was no longer master of their riotous disposition and that all his orders were neglected  Hall fol  They broke into a rich house which they plundered and the citizens alarmed with this act of violence shut their gates against them and being seconded by a detachment of soldiers sent them by lord Scales governor of the tower they repulsed the insurgents with great slaughter  Hist Croyl contin p  The Kentishmen were so discouraged with this blow that upon receiving a general pardon from the primate then chancellor they retreated towards Rochester and then dispersed The pardon was soon after annulled as being extorted by violence A price was set on Cade's head  Rymer vol p  who was killed by one Iden a gentleman of Sussex and many of his followers were capitally punished for their rebellion  IT was imagined by the court that the duke of York had secretly instigated Cade to this attempt in order to make an experiment of the dispositions of the people towards his title and family  Cotton p Stowe p  And as the trial had succeeded to his wish the ruling party had greater reason than ever to apprehend the future consequences of his pretensions At the same time they heard that he intended to return from Ireland and fearing that he meant to bring an armed force along with him they issued orders in the King's name for opposing him and for refusing him access into England  Stowe p  But the duke disarmed his enemies by coming attended with no more than his ordinary retinue The precautions of the ministers served only to shew him their jealousy and malignity against him He was sensible that his title by being dangerous to the King was also become dangerous to himself He now saw the impossibility of remaining in his present situation and the necessity of proceeding forward in support of his claim His partizans therefore were instructed to maintain in all companies his right by succession and by the established laws and constitution of the kingdom These questions became every day more and more the subject of conversation The minds of men were insensibly sharpened against each other by disputes before they came to more dangerous extremities And various topics were pleaded in support of the pretensions of each party  The parties of Lancaster and York  THE partizans of the house of Lancaster maintained that tho' the exaltation of Henry IV might at first be deemed somewhat irregular and could not be justified by any of those principles on which that prince chose to rest his title it was yet founded on general consent was a national act and was derived from the voluntary approbation of a free people who being loosened from their allegiance by the tyranny of the preceding government were moved by gratitude as well as by a sense of public interest to commit the sceptre into the hands of their deliverer That even if that establishment were allowed to be at first invalid it had acquired solidity by time the only principle which ultimately gives authority to government and removes those scruples which the irregular steps attending all revolutions naturally excite in the minds of the people That the right of succession was a rule admitted only for general good and for the maintenance of public order and could never be pleaded to the overthrow of national tranquility and the subversion of regular establishments That the principles of liberty no less than the maxims of internal peace were injured by these pretensions of the house of York and if so many reiterated acts of the legislature by which the crown was entailed on the present family were now invalidated the English nation must be considered not as a free people who could dispose of their own  government but as a troop of slaves who were implicitly transmitted by succession from one hand to another That the nation was bound to allegiance under the house of Lancaster by moral no less than by political duty and were they to infringe those numerous oaths of fealty which they had sworn to Henry and his numerous predecessors they would thenceforth be so thrown loose from all principles that it would be found difficult ever after to six and restrain them That the duke of York himself had frequently done homage to the King as his lawful sovereign and had thereby in the most solemn manner made an indirect renunciation of those claims with which he now dared to disturb the tranquility of the public That even tho' the violation of the rights of blood made on the deposition of Richard was perhaps rash and imprudent it was now too late to remedy the mischief the danger of a disputed succession could no longer be obviated the people accustomed to a government which in the hands of the late King had been so glorious and in that of his predecessor so prudent and salutary would still ascribe a right to it by causing multiplied disorders and by shedding an inundation of blood the advantage would only be obtained of exchanging one pretender for another and the house of York itself if established on the throne would on the first opportunity be exposed to those revolutions which the giddy spirit excited in the people gave so much reason to apprehend And that tho' the present King enjoyed not the shining talents which had appeared in his father and grandfather he might still have a son who should be endowed with them he was himself eminent for the most harmless and inoffensive manners and if active princes were dethroned on pretence of tyranny and indolent ones on the plea of incapacity there would thenceforth remain in the constitution no settled and established rule of obedience to any sovereign  THESE strong topics in favour of the house of Lancaster were opposed by arguments no less convincing on the side of the house of York The partizans of this latter family asserted that the maintenance of order in the succession of princes so far from incroaching on the rights of the people or invalidating their fundamental title to good government was established only for the purposes of government and served to prevent those numberless confusions which must ensue if no rule was followed but the uncertain and disputed views of present convenience and advantage That the same maxims which ensured the public peace were also salutary to national liberty the privileges of the people could only be maintained by the observance of laws and if no account was made of the rights of the sovereign it could less be expected that any regard would be paid to the property and freedom of the subject That it was never too late to correct any pernicious precedent an unjust establishment the longer it stood acquired the  greater sanction and validity it could with more appearance of reason be pleaded as an authority for a like injustice and the maintenance of it instead of favouring public tranquility tended to disjoint every principle by which human society was supported That usurpers would be happy if their present possession of power or their continuance for a few years could convert them into legal princes but nothing would be more miserable than the people if all restraints on violence and ambition were thus removed and a full scope given to the attempts of every turbulent innovator That time indeed bestowed a solidity on government whose first foundation was the most infirm but it acquired a long course of time to operate this effect and the total extinction of those claimants whose title was built on the original principles of the constitution That the deposition of Richard and the advancement of Henry IV were not deliberate national acts but the result of the levity and violence of the people and proceeded from those very defects in human nature which the establishment of political society and of an order in succession was calculated to prevent That the subsequent entails of the crown were a continuance of the same violence and usurpation they were not ratified by the legislature since the consent of the rightful King was still wanting and the acquiescence first of the family of Mortimer then of that of the family of York proceeded from present necessity and implied no renunciation of their pretensions That the restoration of that order of succession could not be considered as a change which familiarized the people to revolutions but as a correction of former changes which had itself encouraged the giddy spirit of innovation rebellion and disobedience And that as the original title of Lancaster stood only in the person of Henry IV on present convenience even this principle unjustifiable as it was when not supported by laws and warranted by the constitution had now entirely gone over to the other side nor was there any comparison between a prince utterly unable to sway the scepter and governed entirely by corrupt ministers or by an imperious Queen engaged in foreign and hostile interests and a prince of mature years of approved wisdom and experience a native of England the lineal heir of the crown who by his restoration would replace every thing on their antient foundations  So many plausible arguments could be urged on both sides of this interesting question that the people were extremely divided in their sentiments and tho' the noblemen of greatest power and influence seem to have embraced the party of York the opposite cause had the advantage of being supported by the present laws and by the immediate possession of royal authority There were also many great noblemen of the Lancastrian party who ballanced the power of their antagonists and kept the nation in suspence between them The earl of Northumberland  adhered to the present government The earl of Westmoreland in spite of his connections with the duke of York and with the family of Nevil of which he was the head was brought over to the same party and the whole north of England the most warlike part of the kingdom was by means of these two potent noblemen engaged warmly in the interests of Lancaster Edmund Beaufort duke of Somerset and his brother Henry were great supports of that cause as were also Henry Holland duke of Exeter Stafford duke of Buckingham the earl of Shrewsbury the lord Clifford lord Dudley lord Scales lord Audley and other noblemen  WHILE the kingdom was in this situation it might naturally be expected that so many turbulent barons possessed of so much independant authority would immediately have flown to arms and have decided the quarrel after their usual manner by war and battle under the standard of the contending princes But there were still many causes which retarded these desperate extremities and made a long train of faction intrigue and cabal precede the military operations By the gradual progress of arts in England as well as in other parts of Europe the people were now become of some consequence laws were beginning to be respected by them and it was requisite by various pretences previously to reconcile their minds to the overthrow of such an antient establishment as that of the house of Lancaster ere their concurrence could reasonably be expected The duke of York himself the new claimant was of a very moderate and cautious character an enemy to violence and inclined to trust rather to time and policy than to sanguinary measures for the success of his pretensions The very imbecillity itself of Henry tended to keep the factions in suspence and made them stand long in awe of each other It rendered the Lancastrian party unable to strike any violent blow against their enemies it encouraged the Yorkists to hope that after banishing the King's ministers and getting possession of his person they might gradually undermine his authority and be able without the perilous experiment of a civil war to change the succession by parliamentary and legal authority  th Nov  THE disposition which appeared in a parliament assembled soon after the arrival of the duke of York from Ireland favoured these expectations and both discovered an unusual boldness in the commons and were a proof of the general discontents which prevailed against the administration The lower house without any previous enquiry or examination without alledging any other cause than common fame ventured to present an address against the duke of Somerset the dutchess of Suffolk the bishop of Chester Sir John Sutton lord Dudley and several  others of inserior rank and they prayed the King to remove them for ever from his person and councils and to prohibit them from approaching within twelve miles of the court  Parliamentary History vol p  This was a violent attack somewhat arbitrary and supported but by few precedents against the ministry yet the King durst not entirely and openly oppose it He replied that except the lords he would banish all the others from court during a year unless he had occasion for their assistance in suppressing any rebellion At the same time he rejected a bill which had passed both houses for attainting the late duke of Suffolk and which discovered a very general prejudice against the measures of the court  The first armament of the duke of York  THE duke of York trusting to these symptoms raised an army of men with which he marched towards London demanding a reformation of the government and the removal of the duke of Somerset from all his power and authority  Stowe p  He found unexpectedly the gates of the city shut against him and on his retreating into Kent he was followed by the King at the head of a superior army in which several of Richard's friends particularly Salisbury and Warwic appeared probably with a view of mediating between the parties and of seconding on occasion the duke of York's pretensions A parley ensued Richard still insisted upon the removal of Somerset and his submitting to a trial in parliament The court pretended to comply with his demand and that nobleman was put under arrest The duke of York was then persuaded to pay his respects to the King in his tent and on repeating his charge against the duke of Somerset he was surprized to see that minister step from behind the curtain and offer to justify his innocence Richard now found that he was betrayed that he was in the hands of his enemies and that it was become necessary for his own safery to lower his pretensions No violence however was attempted against him The nation was not in a disposition to bear the destruction of so popular a prince He had many friends in Henry's army And his son who was not in the power of the court might still be able to revenge his death on all his enemies He was therefore dismissed and he retired to his seat at Wigmore on the borders of Wales  Grafton p    WHILE the duke of York lived in this retreat there happened an incident which by encreasing the public discontents proved favourable to his hopes Several Gascon lords affectionate to the English government and disgusted with the new dominion of the French came to London and offered to return to their allegiance under Henry  Holingshed p  The earl of Shrewsbury with a body of  men was sent over to support them  Bourdeaux opened its gates to him He made himself master of Fronsac Castillon and some other places His affairs bore for some time a prosperous aspect  th July  But as King Charles hastened to resist this dangerous invasion the fortunes of the English were then reversed Shrewsbury a venerable warrior above eighty years of age was killed in battle his conquests were lost Bourdeaux was again obliged to submit to the French King  Polyd Virg p Grafton p  and all hopes of recovering that province were for ever extinguished  THO' the English might deem themselves happy to be fairly rid of distant dominions which were of no use to them and which they never could defend against the growing power of France they expressed great discontent on this occasion and they threw all the blame on the ministry who had not been able to effect impossibilities  th October  While they were in this disposition the birth of a son to Henry who was baptized under the name of Edward was deemed no joyful incident and as it removed all hopes of the peaceable succession of the duke of York who was otherwise in the right of his father and by the laws enacted since the accession of the house of Lancaster next heir to the crown it had rather a tendency to inflame the quarrel between the parties But the duke was incapable of violent councils and even when no visible obstacle lay between him and the throne he was prevented by his own scruples from mounting it  Henry always unfit to exercise the government fell at this time into a distemper which so far encreased his natural imbecillity that it rendered him incapable of maintaining even the appearance of royalty The Queen and the council destitute of this support found themselves unable to resist the York party and they were obliged to yield to the torrent They sent Somerset to the Tower and appointed Richard lieutenant of the kingdom with powers to open and hold a session of parliament  Rymer vol p  That assembly also taking into consideration the state of the kingdom created him protector during pleasure Men who thus entrusted royal authority to one who had such evident and strong pretensions to the crown were not surely averse to his taking immediate and full possession of it Yet the duke instead of pushing them to make farther concessions appeared somewhat timid and irresolute even in receiving that power which was tendered to him He desired that it might be recorded in parliament that this authority was conferred on him of their own free motion without any application on his part He expressed his hopes that they would assist him in the exercise of it He made it a condition of his acceptance that the other lords who were appointed to be of his council should also accept of that trust and should exercise it And he required that all the powers of his office should be  specified and defined by act of parliament This moderation of Richard was certainly very unusual and very amiable but it was attended with bad consequences in the present state of affairs and by giving time for the animosities of faction to arise and ferment in proved the source of all these furious wars and commotions which ensued  THE enemies of the duke of York soon found it in their power to make advantage of his excessive caution Henry having so far recovered from his distemper as to carry the appearance of exercising the royal power they moved him to resume his authority to annual the regency of the duke to release Somerset from the Tower  R  mer vol p Holingshed p Grafton p  and to commit the administration into the hands of that nob  eman  Richard sensible of the dangers which might attend his former acceptance of the parliamentary commission should he submit to the annulling of it levied an army but still without advancing any pretensions to the crown He complained only of the King's ministers and demanded a reformation of the government  A battle was fought at St Albans in which the Yorkists were superior and without suffering any loss on their side slew above of their enemies among whom were the duke of Somerset the earl of Northumberland the earl of Stafford eldest son to the duke of Buckingham lord Clifford and many other persons of distinction  Stowe p H  gshed p    The King himself fell into the hands of the duke of York who treated him with great respect and tenderness He was only obliged which he regarded as no hardship to commit the while authority of the crown into the hands of his rival  THIS was the first blood spilt in that fatal quarrel which was not finished in less than a course of thirty years which was signalized by twelve pitched battles which opened a scene of extraordinary fierceness and cruelty is computed to have cost the lives of eighty princes of the blood and almost entirely annihilated the antient nobility of England The strong attachments which at that time men of the same kindred bore to each other and the vindictive spirit which was considered as a point of honour rendered the great families implacable in their resentments and widened every moment the breach between the parties Yet affairs did not immediately proceed to the last extremities The nation was kept for s  me time in suspence The vigor and spirit of Queen Margaret supp  ting her small power still proved a ballance to the great authority of Richard which was checked by his irresolute temper A parliament which was soon after assembled discovered plainly by the contrariety of their proceedings the contrariety  of the motives by which they were actuated They granted the Yorkists a general indemnity and they restored the protectorship to the duke who in accepting it still persevered in all his former precautions But at the same time they renewed their oaths of fealty to Henry and fixed the continuance of the protectorship to the majority of his eldest son Edward who was invested in the usual dignities of prince of Wales duke of Cornwal and earl of Chester The only decisive act passed by this parliament was a full resumption of all the grants which had been made since the death of Henry V and which had reduced the crown to the most scandalous poverty  IT was not found difficult to wrest power from hands so little tenacious as those of the duke of York Margaret availing herself of that prince's absence produced her husband before the house of lords and as his state of health permitted him at that time to act his part with some tolerable decency he declared his intentions to resume the government and to put an end to Richard's authority This measure being unexpected was not opposed by the contrary party The house of lords who were many of them disgusted with the late act of resumption assented to Henry's proposal And the King was accordingly declared to be reinstated in his sovereign authority The duke of York even acquiesced in this irregular act of the peers and no disturbance ensued But that prince's claim to the crown was too well known and the steps which he had taken to promote it were too evident ever to allow sincere trust and confidence to have place between the parties  The court retired to Coventry and invited the duke of York and the earls of Salisbury and Warwic to attend the King's person As they were on the road they received intelligence that designs were formed by their enemies against their liberties and lives They immediately separated themselves Richard withdrew to his castle of Wigmore in the county of Hereford Salisbury to Middleham in Yorkshire And Warwic to his government of Calais which had been committed to him after the battle of St Albans and which as it gave him the command of the only regular military force maintained by England was of the utmost importance in the present juncture Still men of peaceable dispositions and among the rest Bourchier archbishop of Canterbury thought it not too late to interpose with th ir good offices in order to prevent that effusion of blood with which the kingdom was threatened and the awe in which each party stood of the other rendered their mediation for some time successful It was agreed that all the great leaders on both sides should meet in London and be solemnly reconciled  The duke of York and his partizans came thither with numerous retinues and took up their quarters near each other for mutual  security The chieftains of the Lancastrian party used the same precaution The mayor at the head of men kept a strict guard night and day and was extremely vigilant in maintaining peace between them  F  Chron anno The author says that some lords brought retainers some  less than See also Grafton p  Terms were were adjusted which took not away the ground of difference An outward reconciliation only was procured And in order to notify this accord to the whole people a solemn procession to St Paul's was appointed where the duke of York led queen Margaret and a chieftain of one party marched hand in hand with a chieftain of the opposite  Holingshed p Poly Virg p Grafton p  The less real cordiality prevailed the more were the exterior demonstrations of friendship and amity redoubled But it was evident to all men of sense that a contest for a crown could not thus be peaceably accommodated that each party only watched for an opportunity of subverting the other and that much blood must yet be spilt ere the nation could be restored to perfect tranquility or enjoy a settled and established government  EVEN the smallest accident without any formed design was sufficient in the present disposition of mens minds to dissolve the seeming amity between the parties and had the intentions of the leaders been ever so amicable they would have found it difficult to restrain the animosity of their followers One of the King's retinue insulted one of the earl of Warwic's Their companions on each side took part in the quarrel A fierce combat ensued The earl apprehended his life to be aimed at He fled over to his government at Calais  Grafton p  and both parties in every county of England openly made preparations for deciding the contest by war and arms  Battle of  THE earl of Salisbury marching to join the duke of York was overtaken at Bloreheath on the borders of Staffordshire by lord Audley who commanded much superior forces and a small rivulet with steep banks ran between the two armies Salisbury here supplied his defect in numbers by stratagem a refinement of which there occur few instances in the English civil wars where a headlong courage more than military conduct is commonly to be remarked He feigned a retreat and allured Audley to follow him with precipitation But when part of the royal army had passed the brook Salisbury suddenly turned upon them and partly by the surprize partly by the division of the enemies forces put them to rout The example of flight was followed by the rest of the army And Salisbury obtaining a complete victory reached the general rendezvous of the Yorkists at Ludlow  Holingshed p Grafton p    THE earl of Warwic brought over to this rendezvous a choice body of veterans from Calais on whom it was thought the fortune of the war would much depend but this reinforcement proved in the issue the ruin of the duke of York's party When the royal army approached and a general action was every hour expected Sir Andrew Trollop who commanded the Veterans deserted to the King in the nighttime and the Yorkists were so dismayed by this instance of treachery which made every man apprehensive of his fellow that they separated next day without striking a stroke  Holingshed p Grafton p  The duke of York fled to Ireland The earl of Warwic attended by many of the other leaders escaped to his government of Calais where his great popularity among all orders of men in the kingdom particularly among the military soon drew to him partizans and rendered his power very formidable The friends of the house of York in England kept themselves every where in readiness to rise on the first summons from their leaders  AFTER meeting with some successes at sea Warwic landed in Kent with the earl of Salisbury and the earl of Marche eldest son to the duke of York and being met by the primate the lord Cobham and other persons of distinction he marched amidst the acclamations of the people to London The city immediately opened its gates to him and his troops encreasing on every day's march he soon found himself in a condition to face the royal army which hastened from Coventry to attack him  Battle of Northampton  The battle was fought at Northampton and was soon decided against the royalists by the infidelity of lord Grey of Ruthin who commanding Henry's vanguard deserted to the enemy during the heat of action and spread a consternation thro' the troops  th July  The duke of Buckingham the earl of Shrewsbury the lords Beaumont and Egremont and Sir William Lucie were killed in the action or pursuit The slaughter fell chiefly on the gentry and nobility the common people were spared by orders of the earls of Warwic and Marche  Stowe p  Henry himself that empty shadow of a King was again taken prisoner and as the innocence and simplicity of his manners which bore the appearance of sanctity had procured him the tender regard of the people  Hall fol Grafton p  the earl of Warwic and the other leaders took care to distinguish themselves by their respectful demeanour towards him  A parliament was summoned in the King's name and met at Westminster where the duke of York soon after appeared from Ireland This prince had never hitherto advanced openly any claim to the crown He had only complained of ill ministers and demanded a redress of grievances And even in the present  crisis when the parliament was surrounded by his victorious army he showed such a regard to law and liberty as is very unusual during the prevalence of a party in any civil dissensions and was still less to be expected in those violent and licentious times He advanced towards the throne and being met by the archbishop of Canterbury who asked him whether he had yet paid his respects to the King he replied that he knew of none to whom he owed that title He then stood near the throne  Holingshed p  and addressing himself to the house of peers he gave them a deduction of his title by descent mentioned the cruelties by which the house of Lancaster had paved at first their way to sovereign power insisted on the calamities which had attended the government of Henry exhorted them to return into the right path by doing justice to the lineal successor and thus pleaded his cause before them as his natural and lawful judges  Cotton p Grafton p  This cool and moderate manner of demanding a crown intimidated his friends and discouraged his enemies The lords remained in suspence  Holingshed p Grafton p  and no one ventured to utter a word on this occasion Richard who had probably expected that the peers would have invited him to place himself on the throne was much disappointed at their silence but desiring them to reflect on what he had proposed to them he departed the house The peers took the matter under consideration with as great tranquility as if it had been a common subject of debate They desired the assistance of some considerable members among the commons in their deliberations They heard in several successive days the reasons alledged for the duke of York They even ventured to propose objections to his claim founded on former entails of the crown and on the oaths of fealty sworn to the house of Lancaster  Cotton p  They also observed that as Richard had all along born the arms of York not those of Clarence he could not claim as successor to the latter family And after receiving answers to these objections derived from the violence and power by which the house of Lancaster supported their present possession of the crown they ventured at last to pronounce a decision Their sentence was calculated as far as possible to please both parties They declared the title of the duke of York to be certain and indefeasible but in consideration that Henry had enjoyed the crown without dispute or controversy during the course of thirtyeight years they determined that he should continue to possess the title and dignity during the remainder of his life that the administration of the government meanwhile should remain with Richard that he should be acknowleged the true and lawful heir of the monarchy that every one should swear to maintain his succession that it should be treason to attempt his life and that all former settlements of the  crown in this and the two last reigns should be abrogated and rescinded  Cotton p Grafton p  The duke of York acquiesced in this decision Henry himself being a prisoner could not oppose it Even if he had enjoyed his liberty he would not probably have felt any violent reluctance against it And the act thus passed with the unanimous consent of the whole legislative body Tho' the mildness of this compromise is chiefly to be ascribed to the moderation of the duke of York it is impossible not to observe in those transactions visible marks of a higher regard to law and a more fixed authority enjoyed by parliament than has appeared in any former period of English history  IT is probable that the duke of York without employing either menaces or violence could have obtained from the commons a settlement more consistent and uniform But as many if not all the members of the upper house had received grants concessions or dignities during the last sixty years when the house of Lancaster was possessed of the government they were afraid of invalidating their own titles by too sudden and violent an overthrow of that family and in thus temporizing between the parties they fixed the throne on a basis upon which it could not possibly stand The duke apprehending his chief danger to arise from the genius and spirit of Queen Margaret sought a pretence for banishing her entirely the kingdom and for that purpose he sent her in the King's name a summons to come immediately to London intending in case of her disobedience to proceed to extremities against her But the queen needed not this menace to excite her activity in behalf of the rights of her family After the defeat at Northampton she had fled with her infant son to Durham and from thence to Scotland but soon returning she applied to the northern barons and employed every motive to procure their assistance Her affability insinuation and address qualities in which she excelled her caresses her promises wrought a powerful effect on every one who approached her The admiration of her great qualities was succeeded by compassion towards her helpless condition The nobility of that quarter who regarded themselves as the most warlike of the kingdom were moved by indignation to find the southern barons dispose of the crown and settle the government And that they might allure the people to their standard they promised them the spoils of all the provinces on the other side the Trent By these means the Queen had collected an army twenty thousand strong with a celerity which was neither expected by her friends nor apprehended by her enemies  THE duke of York informed of her appearance in the north hastened thither with a body of men to suppress as he imagined the beginnings of an  insu  rection when on his arrival at Wakefield he found himself so much outnumbered by his enemies He threw himself into Sandal castle which was situuted in the neighbourhood and he was advised by the earl of Salisbury and other prudent counsellors to remain in that fortress till his son the earl of Marche who was levying forces in the borders of Wales could advance to his assistance  Stowe p  But the duke tho' deficient in political courage possessed personal bravery to an eminent degree and notwithstanding all his wisdom and experience he thought that he should be forever disgraced if by taking shelter behind walls he should for a moment resign the victory to a woman  He descended into the plain and offered battle to the enemy which was instantly accepted The great inequality of number was sufficient alone to decide the victory but the Queen by sending a detachment who fell on the back of the duke's army rendered her advantagestill more certain and undisputed  The duke himself was killed in the action and as his body was found among the slain the head was cut off by Margaret's orders and fixed on the gates of York with a paper crown upon it in derision of his pretended title His son the earl of Rutland a youth of seventeen was brought to lord Clifford and that barbarian in revenge of his father's death who had perished in the battle of St Alban's murdered in cold blood and with his own hands this innocent prince whose exterior figure as well as other accomplishments are represented by historians as extremely amiable The earl of Salisbury was wounded and taken prisoner and immediately beheaded with several other persons of distinction by martial law at Pomfret  Polyd Virg p  There fell near three thousand of the Yorkists in this battle The duke himself was greatly and justly lamented by his own party a prince who surely merited a better fate and whose errors in conduct proceeded entirely from such qualities as render him the more an object of esteem and affection He perished in the fiftieth year of his age and left behind him three sons Edward George and Richard with three daughters Anne Elizabeth and Margaret  THE queen after this important victory divided her army and sent the smaller division under Jasper Tudor earl of Pembroke half brother to the King against Edward the present duke of York She marched herself with the larger division towards London where the earl of Warwic was left with the command of the York  sts  Pembroke was defeated by Edward at Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire with the loss of near men His army was dispersed he himself escaped by flight but his father Sir Owen Tudor was taken prisoner and immediately beheaded by Edward's orders This barbarous practice being once  begun was continued by both parties from revenge which covered itself under the pretence of retaliation  Holingshed p Grafton p    MARGARET compensated this defeat by a victory which she obtained over the earl of Warwic That nobleman on the approach of the Lancastrians led out his army reinforced by a strong body of the Londoners who were very affectionate to his cause  battle of St Alban's  and he gave battle to the Queen at St Albans While the armies were warmly engaged Lovelace who commanded a considerable body of the Yorkists treacherously withdrew from the combat and this dishonourable action of which there are many instances in these civil wars decided the victory in favour of the Queen About of the Yorkists perished in the battle and flight and the person of the King fell again into the hands of his own party This weak prince was sure to be almost equally a prisoner whichever party had the keeping of him and scarce any more decorum was observed by the one than by the other in their method of treating him Lord Bonville to whose care he had been entrusted staid with him after the defeat on assurance of pardon given him by Henry But Margaret regardless of her husband's promise ordered immediately the head of that nobleman to be struck off by the executioner  Holingshed  Sir Thomas Kiriel a brave warrior who had signalized himself in the French wars was treated in the same inhuman manner  THE Queen made no great advantage of this victory Young Edward advanced upon her from the other side and collecting the remains of Warwic's army was soon in a condition of giving her battle with superior forces She was sensible of her danger if she lay between the enemy and the city of London and she found it necessary to retreat with her army to the north  Grafton p  Edward entered London amidst the acclamations of the citizens and immediately opened a new scene to his party This prince in the bloom of youth remarkable for the beauty of his person for his bravery his activity his affability and every popular quality found himself so much possessed of public favour that elated with the spirit natural to his age he resolved no longer to confine himself within those narrow limits which his father had prescribed to himself and which had been found by experience so prejudicial to his cause He determined to assume the name and dignity of King to insist openly on his claim and thenceforth to treat the opposite party as traitors and rebels to his lawful authority But as a national consent or the appearance of it seemed notwithstanding his plausible title to be still requisite to precede this bold measure and as the assembling a parliament might occasion too many delays and be attended with other inconveniencies he ventured to proceed in a less regular manner and to put it out of the  power of his enemies to throw obstacles in the way of his advancement His army was ordered to assemble in St John's Fields infinite numbers of people surrounded them an harangue was pronounced to this mixed multitude setting forth the t  tle of Edward and inveighing against the tyranny and usurpation of the rival family and the people were then asked whether they would have Henry of Lancaster for King They universally exclaimed against the proposal It was then demanded whether they would accept of Edward eldest son of the late duke of York They expressed their consent with loud and joyful acclamations  H  lingshed p    Edward IV    A great number of bishops lords magistrates and other persons of distinction were then assembled at Baynard's castle who ratified the popular election  March  and the new King was next day proclaimed in London under the name of Edward IV  Grafton p    IN this manner finished the reign of Henry VI a monarch who while yet in his cradle had been proclaimed King both of France and England and who began his life with the most splendid prospects which any prince in Europe had ever enjoyed The revolution was unhappy for his people as it was the source of civil wars but was almost entirely indifferent to Henry himself who was utterly incapable of exercising his authority and who provided he met personally with good usage was equally easy as he was equally enslaved in the hands of his enemies and of his friends His weakness and his disputed title were the chief causes of the public misfortunes But whether his Queen and his ministers were not also guilty of some great abuses of power it is not easy for us at this distance to determine There remain no proofs on record of any considerable violation of the laws except in the death of the duke of Glocester which was a private crime formed no precedent and was but too much of a piece with the usual ferocity and cruelty of the times  Miscellaneous    THE most remarkable law which passed in this reign was that for the due election of members of parliament in counties After the fall of the feudal system the distinction of tenures was in a great measure lost and every freeholder as will those who held of mesne lords as the immediate tenants of the crown were by degrees admitted to give their votes at elections This innovation was confirmed by a law of Henry IV  Statutes at large he  y IV cap    which gave right to such a multitude of electors as was the occasion of great disorder In the eighth and tenth of this King therefore laws were enacted limiting the electors to such as possessed forty shil  ings a year in land free from all burthen within the county  Statutes at large S Henry VI cap Henry VI cap  This  sum was equivalent to near twenty pounds a year of our present money and it were to be wished that the spirit as well as letter of this law had been maintained  THE preamble of the statute is remarkable  "Whereas the elections of knights have of late in many counties of England been made by outrageous and excessive numbers of people many of them of small substance and value yet pretending to a right equal to the best knights and esquires whereby manslaughters riots batteries and divisions among the gentlemen and other people of the same counties shall very likely rise and be unless due remedy be provided in this behalf c"  We may learn from these expressions what an important matter the election of a member of parliament was now become in England That assembly was beginning in this period to assume great authority The commons had it much in their power to enforce the execution of the laws and if they failed in their duty in this particular it proceeded less from any exorbitant power of the crown than from the licentious spirit of the aristocracy and perhaps from the rude education of the age and their own want of a due sense of the advantages resulting from a regular administration of justice  WHEN the duke of York the earls of Salisbury and Warwic fled the kingdom upon the desertion of their troops a parliament was summoned at Coventry in by which they were all attainted This parliament seems to have been very irregularly constituted and scarcely deserves the name Insomuch that an act passed in it  "that all such knights of any county as were returned by virtue of the King's letters without any other election should be valid and that no sheriff for returning them should incur the penalty of the statute of Henry IV  Cotton p  All the acts of that

and devastation as must conduct him to the full possession of that crown which he claimed from hereditary right but which he had assumed from the tumultuary election alone of his own party He was bold active enterprizing and his hardness of heart and severity of character rendered him impregnable to all those movements of compassion which might relax his vigour in the prosecution of the most bloody revenges against his enemies The very commencement of his reign gave symptoms of his sanguinary disposition A tradesman of London who kept shop at the sign of the crown having said that he would make his son heir to the crown this harmless pleasantry was interpreted to be spoke in derision of Edward's assumed title and he was condemned and executed for the offence  Habington in Kennet p Grafton p    Such an act of tyranny was a proper prelude to the scenes which ensued The scaffold as well as the field streamed incessantly with the noblest blood of England spilt in the quarrel between the two contending families whose animosity was now become  implacable The people divided in their affections took also opposite symbols of party The partizans of the house of Lancaster chose the red rose as their mark of distinction those of York were denominated from the white and these civil wars were thus known all over Europe by the name of the quarrel between the two roses  THE licence in which queen Margaret had been obliged to indulge her troops struck a great terror into the city of London and all the southern parts of the kingdom and as she there expected a very obstinate resistance she prudently retired northwards among her own partizans The same licence joined to the zeal of faction soon brought great multitudes to her standard and she was able in a few days to assemble an army sixty thousand strong in Yorkshire The King and the earl of Warwic made haste with an army of forty thousand to check her progress and when they reached Pomfret they dispatched a body of troops under the command of the lord Fitzwalter to secure the passage of Ferrybridge over the river Are which lay between them and the enemy Fitzwalter took post at the place assigned him but was not able to defend it against lord Clifford who attacked him with superior numbers The Yorkists were chaced over the river with great slaughter and lord Fitzwalter himself was slain in the action  W Wyrcester p Hall fol Holingshed p  The earl of Warwic dreading the consequences of this misfortune at a time when a decisive action was every hour expected immediately ordered his horse to be brought him which he stabbed before the whole army and kissing the hilt of his sword swore that he was determined to share the fate of the meanest soldier  Habington p  And to show the greater security a proclamation was at the same time issued giving to every one who pleased full liberty to retire but menacing the severest punishments to those who should discover any symptoms of cowardice in the ensuing battle

disaster by the defeat of the party and the death of their leader  Hist Croyl cont p    Battle of Touton th of Mar  THE two hostile armies met at Touton and a fierce and bloody battle ensued While the Yorkists were advancing to the charge there happened a great fall of snow which driving full on the faces of their enemies blinded them and this advantage was improved by a stratagem of lord Falconbridge That nobleman ordered some infantry to advance before the line and after having sent a volley of flightarrows as they were called amidst the enemy immediately to retire The Lancastrians imagining that they were got within reach of the opposite  army discharged all their arrows which thus fell short of the Yorkists without doing any execution  Hall fol  After the quivers of the enemy were exhausted Edward advanced his line and committed slaughter with impunity on the dismayed Lancastrians The bow however was soon laid aside and the sword decided the combat which ended in a total victory on the side of the Yorkists Edward issued orders to give no quarter  Habington p  The routed army was pursued to Tadcaster with great bloodshed and confusion and above thirty six thousand men are computed to have fallen in the battle and pursuit  Holingshed p Grafton p Hist Croyl cont p  Among these were the earl of Westmoreland and his brother Sir John Nevil the earl of Northumberland the lords Dacres and Welles and Sir Andrew Trollop  Hall fol Habington p  The earl of Devonshire who was now engaged in Henry's party was brought a prisoner to Edward and was soon after beheaded by martial law at York His head was fixed on a pole erected over the gates of that city and the head of duke Richard and that of the earl of Salisbury were taken down and buried with their bodies Henry and Margaret had remained at York during the action but learning the defeat of their army and being sensible that no place in England could now afford them shelter they fled with great precipitation into Scotland They were accompanied by the duke of Exeter who tho' he had married Edward's sister had taken part with the Lancastrians and by Henry duke of Somerset who had commanded in the unfortunate battle of Touton and who was the son of that nobleman killed in the first battle of St Albans  Henry escapes into Scotland  NOTWITHSTANDING the great animosity which prevailed between the two kingdoms Scotland had never exerted itself with vigour to take advantage either of the wars which England carried on with France or of the civil wars which broke out between the contending families James I more laudably employed in civilizing his subjects and taming them to the salutary yoke of law and justice avoided all hostilities with foreign nations and tho' he seemed interested to maintain a ballance between France and England he gave no farther assistance to the former kingdom in its greatest distresses than permitting and perhaps encouraging his subjects to inlist in the French service After the murder of that excellent prince the minority of his son and successor James II and the distractions incident to it retained the Scots in the same state of neutrality and the superiority visibly acquired by France rendered it then unnecessary for her ally to interpose in her defence But when the quarrel commenced between the houses of York and Lancaster and became absolutely incurable but by the total extinction of one party James who had now risen to man's estate was tempted  to seize this advantage and he endeavoured to recover those places which the English had formerly conquered from his ancestors He laid siege to the castle of Roxborough in and had provided himself of a small train of artillery for that enterprize But his cannon were so ill framed that one of them burst as he was firing it and put an end to his life in the flower of his age His son and successor James III was also a minor The usual distractions ensued in the government The queen dowager Anne of Gueldres aspired to the regency The family of Douglas opposed her pretensions And queen Margaret when she fled into Scotland found there a people little less divided by faction than those by whom she had been expelled Tho' she pleaded the connexions between the royal family of Scotland and the house of Lancaster by the young King's grandmother who was a daughter of the earl of Somerset she could engage the Scots council to go no farther than to express their good wishes in her favour But on her offer to deliver to them immediately the important fortress of Berwic and to contract her son in marriage with a sister of King James's she found a better reception and the Scots promised the assistance of their arms to reinstate her family upon the throne  Hall fol Habington p  But as the danger from that quarter seemed not very urgent to Edward he did not pursue the fugitive King and Queen into their retreat but returned to London where a parliament was summoned for settling the government  th of Novr A parliament  ON the meeting of this assembly Edward found the good effects of his vigorous measure in assuming the crown as well as of his victory at Touton by which he had secured it The parliament no longer hesitated between the two families or proposed any of those ambiguous decisions which could only tend to perpetuate and inflame the animosities of party They recognized the title of Edward to the crown by hereditary descent thro' the family of Mortimer and declared that he was King in right from the death of his father who had also the same lawful title and that he was in possession of the throne from the day that he assumed the government tendered to him by the acclamations of the people  Cotton p  They expressed their abhorrence of the usurpation and intrusion of the house of Lancaster particularly that of the earl of Derby otherwise called Henry IV which they said had been attended with every kind of disorder the murder of the sovereign and the oppression of the subjects They annulled every grant which had passed in those reigns they reinstated the King in all the possessions which had belonged to the crown at the pretended deposition of Richard II and tho' they confirmed judicial deeds and the decrees of inferior courts  they reversed all attainders passed in any pretended parliament particularly the attainder of the earl of Cambridge the King's grandfather as well as that of the earls of Salisbury and Glocester and of lord Lumley who were forfeited for adhering to Richard II  Cotton p Statutes at large Edw IV cap  MANY of these votes were the result of the usual violence of party The common sense of mankind in more peaceable times repealed them And the statutes of the house of Lancaster being the deeds of an established government and enacted by princes long possessed of authority have always been held as valid and obligatory The parliament however in subverting such deep foundations had still the pretence of replacing the government on its antient and natural basis But in their subsequent measures they were more guided by revenge or at least the views of convenience than by the maxims of equity and justice They passed an act of forfeiture and attainder against Henry VI and queen Margaret and their infant son prince Edward The same act was extended to the dukes of Somerset and Exeter to the earls of Northumberland Devonshire Pembroke Wilts to the viscount Beaumont the lords Roos Nevil Clifford Wells Dacre Gray of Rugemont Hungerford to Alexander Hedie Nicholas Latimer Edmond Mountfort John Heron and many other persons of distinction  Cotton p W Wyrcester p  The parliament vested the estates of all these attainted persons in the crown tho' their sole crime was the adhering to a prince whom every individual of the parliament had so long recognized and whom that very King himself who was now seated on the throne had acknowledged and obeyed as his lawful sovereign  THE necessity of supporting the government established will justify more fully some other acts of violence tho' the method of conducting them may still appear exceptionable John earl of Oxford and his son

government was a high strain of prerogative which were it not for the violence of the times would probably have appeared exceptionable to a nation so jealous of their liberties as the English were now become  That we may judge how arbitrary a court that of the constable of England was we may peruse the patent granted to the earl of Rivers in this reign as it is to be found in Spellman's Glossary in verb  Constabalarius  as also more fully in Rymer vol p Here is a clause of it  Et ulterius de uberiori gratia nostra eidem commiti de Rivers plenam potestatem damus ad cognoscendum procedendum in

veritate inspecta  ac etiam manu regia si oppertanum visum fuerit eidem comiti de Rivers vices nostras appellati  remota  The office of constable was perpetual in the monarchy its jurisdiction was not limited to times of war as appears from this patent and as we learn from the same author Yet its authority was in direct contradiction to  Magna Charta  and it is evident that no  regular  liberty subsist with it It involved a full dictatorial power continually subsisting in the state The only check on the crown besides the want of force to support all its prerogatives was that the office of constable was commonly either hereditary or during life and the person invested with it was for that reason not so proper an instrument of arbitrary power in the King Accordingly the office was suppressed by Henry VIII the most arbitrary of all the English princes The practice however of exercising martial law still subsisted and was not abolished till the Petition of Right under Charles I This was the epoch of true liberty confirmed by the Restoration and enlarged and secured by the Revolution  It was  impossible but such a great and sudden revolution must leave the roots of discontent and dissatisfaction in the subjects which would require great art or in lieu of it great violence to extirpate them The latter was more suitable to the genius of the nation in that uncultivated age  BUT the new establishment seemed precarious and uncertain not only from the domestic discontents of the people but from the efforts of foreign powers Lewis the eleventh of the name had succeeded to his father Charles in and was led from the obvious motives of national interest to feed the flames of civil discord among such dangerous neighbours by giving support to the weaker party But the intriguing and politic genius of this prince was here checked by itself Having attempted to subdue the independant spirit of his own vassals he had excited such an opposition at home as prevented him from making all the advantage which the opportunity afforded of the dissensions among the English  He sent however a small body to Henry's assistance under Varenne Seneschal of Normandy  Monstrelet

th April  she received a check at Hedgleymore from lord Montacute or Montague brother to the earl of Warwic and warden of the east Marches between Scotland and England  Rymer vol p  Montague was so elated with this success that while a numerous reinforcement was on their march to join him by orders from Edward he yet ventured with his own troops alone to attack the Lancastrians at Hexham and he obtained a complete victory over them  Battle of Hexham th May  The duke of Somerset the lords Roos and Hungerford were taken in the pursuit and immediately beheaded by martial law at Hexham  W Wyrcester p Hall fol Grafton p  Summary justice was in like manner executed at Newcastle on sir Humphrey Nevil and several other gentlemen  Fabian fol Polyd Virg p  All those who were spared in the field suffered on the scaffold and the utter extermination of their adversaries was now become the plain object of the York party a conduct which received but too plausible an apology from the preceding practice of the Lancastrians  THE fate of the unfortunate royal family after this defeat was very singular Margaret flying with her son into a forest where she endeavoured to conceal herself was beset during the darkness of the night by robbers who either ignorant or regardless of her quality despoiled her of her rings and jewels and treated her with the utmost indignity The partition of this rich booty raised a quarrel among them and while their attention was thus engaged she took the opportunity of making her escape with her son into the thickest of the forest where she wandered for some time over spent with hunger and fatigue and sunk with terror and affliction While in this wretched condition she saw a robber approach with his naked sword and finding that she had no means of escape she suddenly embraced the resolution of trusting entirely for protection to his faith and generosity She advanced towards him and presenting to him the young prince called out to him  Here my friend I commit to your care the safety of your King's son  The man whose humanity and generous spirit had been obscured but not entirely lost by his vicious course of life was struck with the singularity of the event and charmed with the confidence reposed in him and he vowed not only to abstain from all injury against the princess but to devote himself entirely to her safety and protection  Monstrelet vol p  By his means she dwelt some time concealed in the forest and was at last conducted to the seacoast whence she made her escape into Flanders She passed thence into her father's court where she lived several years in privacy and retirement Her husband was not so fortunate or so dextrous in finding the means of his escape Some of his friends took him under  their protection and conveyed him into Lancashire where he remained concealed during a twelvemonth but he was at last detected delivered up to Edward and thrown into the Tower  Hall fol Fragm ad finem Sproti  The safety of his person was owing less to the generosity of his enemies than to the contempt which they had entertained of his courage and his understanding  THE imprisonment of Henry the expulsion of Margaret the execution and confiscation of all the most considerable Lancastrians seemed to give full security to Edward's government whose title by blood being now recognized by parliament and universally submitted to by the people was no longer in danger of being impeached by any antagonist In this prosperous situation the King delivered himself up without controul to those pleasures which his youth his high fortune and his natural temperament invited him to enjoy and the cares of royalty were less attended to than the dissipation of amusement or the allurements of passion The cruel and unrelenting spirit of Edward tho' enured to the ferocity of civil wars was at the same time extremely devoted to the softer passions which without mitigating his severe temper maintained a great influence over him and shared his attachment with the pursuits of ambition and the thirst of military glory During the present interval of peace he lived in the most familiar and sociable manner with his subjects  Polyd Virg p Biondi  particularly with the Londoners and the beauty of his person as well as the gallantry of his address which even unassisted by his royal dignity would have rendered him extremely acceptable to the fair sex facilitated all his applications for their favour This easy and pleasurable life augmented every day his popularity among all ranks of men He was the peculiar favourite of the young and gay of both sexes The disposition of the English little addicted to jealousy kept them from taking umbrage at these liberties And his indulgence in amusements while it gratified his inclination was thus become without design a means of supporting and securing his government But as it is difficult to reduce the ruling passion within strict rules of prudence the amorous temper of Edward led him into a snare which proved very fatal to his future repose and to the stability of his throne  King's marriage with the lady Elizabeth Gray  JAQUELINE DE LUXEMBOURG dutchess of Bedford had after her husband's death so far sacrificed her ambition to love that she espoused in second marriage sir Richard Wideville a private gentleman afterwards created lord Rivers to whom she bore several children and among the rest Elizabeth who was remarkable for the grace and beauty of her person as well as for other amiable accomplishments This young lady had married sir John Gray of Groby by whom she had children and her husband being killed in the second battle of St Albans  fighting on the side of Lancaster and his estate being for that reason confiscated his widow retired to live with her father at his seat of Grafton in Northamptonshire The King came accidentally to the house after a hunting party in order to pay a visit to the duchess of Bedford and as the occasion seemed favourable for obtaining some grace from this gallante monarch the young widow flung herself at his feet and with many tears entreated him to take pity on her impoverished and distressed children The sight of so much beauty in affliction strongly affected the amorous Edward love stole insensibly into his heart under the guise of compassion and her sorrow so becoming a virtuous matron made his esteem and regard quickly correspond to his affection He raised her from the ground with assurances of favour he found his passion encrease every moment by the conversation of the amiable object and he was soon reduced in his turn to the posture and stile of a supplicant at the feet of Elizabeth But the lady either averse to dishonourable love from a sense of duty or perceiving that the impression which she had made was so deep as to give her hopes of obtaining the highest elevation obstinately refused to gratify his passion and all the endearments caresses and importunity of the young and amiable Edward proved fruitless against her rigid and inflexible virtue His passion irritated by opposition and encreased by his veneration for such honourable sentiments carried him at last beyond all bounds of reason and he offered to share his throne as well as his heart with the woman whose beauty of person and dignity of character seemed so well to entitle her to both The marriage was celebrated privately at Grafton  Hall fol Fabian fol  The secret was carefully kept for some time No one suspected that so libertine a prince could sacrifice so much to a romantic passion And there were in particular strong reasons which at that time rendered this step in the highest degree dangerous and imprudent  THE King desirous to secure his throne as well by the prospect of issue as by foreign alliances had a little before determined to make application to some neighbouring princess and he had cast his eye on Bona of Savoy sister to the Queen of France who he hoped would by his marrying her ensure him the friendship of that power which was alone both able and inclined to give support and assistance to his rival To render the negotiation more successful the earl of Warwic had been dispatched to Paris where the princess then resided he had demanded Bona in marriage for the King his proposals had been accepted the treaty was fully concluded and nothing remained but the ratification of the terms agreed on and the bringing over the princess into England  Hall fol Habington p Holingshed p Grafton p Polyd Virg p  But when  the secret of Edward's marriage broke out the haughty earl deeming himself affronted both by being employed in this deceitful negotiation and by being kept a stranger to the King's intentions who had owed every thing to his friendship immediately returned to England inflamed with rage and indignation The influence of passion over so young a man as Edward might have served as an excuse for his imprudent conduct had he deigned to acknowledge his error or had pleaded his weakness as an apology But his faulty shame or pride prevented him from so much as mentioning the affair to Warwic  and that nobleman was allowed to depart the court full of the same ill humour and discontent which he brought to it  EVERY incident now tended to widen the breach between the King and this powerful subject The Queen lost not her influence by marriage and she was equally solicitous to draw every grace and favour to her own friends and kindred and to exclude those of the earl whom she regarded as her mortal enemy Her father was created earl of Rivers He was made lord treasurer in the room of lord Mountjoy  W Wyrcester p  He was invested in the office of constable for life and his son received the survivance of that high dignity  Rymer vol p  The same young nobleman was married to the only daughter of lord Scales enjoyed the great estate of that family and had the title of Scales conferred upon him Catharine the Queen's sister was married to the young duke of Buckingham who was a ward of the crown  W Wyrcester p  Mary another of her sisters espoused William Herbert created earl of Huntingdon Anne a third sister was given in marriage to the son and heir of Gray lord Ruthyn created earl of Kent  W Wyrcester p  The daughter and heir of the duke of Exeter who was also the King's neice was contracted to sir Thomas Gray one of the Queen's sons by her former husband and as the lord Montague was treating of a marriage between his son and this lady the preference given to young Gray was deemed an injury and affront to the whole family of Nevil  THE earl of Warwic could not endure the least diminution of that credit which he had long enjoyed and which he thought he had merited by such important services Tho' he had received so many grants from the crown that the revenue arising from them amounted besides his patrimonial estate to crowns a year according to the computation of Philip de Comines  Liv  chap  his ambitious spirit was still dissatisfied so long as he saw others surpass him in authority and influence with the King  Polyd Virg p  Edward also jealous of that power which had supported him  and which he himself had contributed still higher to exalt was wellpleased to raise up rivals in credit to the earl of Warwic and he justified by this political view his extreme partiality to the Queen's kindred But the other nobility of England envying the sudden growth of the Widevilles  Hist Croyl cont p  were more inclined to take part with Warwic's discontent to whose grandeur they were already accustomed and who had reconciled them to his superiority by his gracious and popular manners And as Edward obtained from parliament a general resumption of all grants which he had made since his accession and which had extremely impoverished the crown  W Wyrcester p  this act tho' it passed with some exceptions particularly one in favour of the earl of Warwic gave a general alarm to the nobility and disgusted many even zealous partizans of the family of York  BUT the most considerable associate whom Warwic acquired to his party was George duke of Clarence the King's second brother This prince deemed himself no less injured than the other grandees by the uncontrouled influence of the queen and her relations and as his fortunes were still left on a precarious footing while theirs were fully established this neglect joined to his unquiet and restless spirit inclined him to give countenance to all the malecontents  Grafton p  The favourable opportunity of gaining him was espied by the earl of Warwic who offered him in marriage his eldest daughter and coheir of his immense fortunes a settlement which as it was superior to any that the King himself could confer upon him immediately attached him to the earl's party  W Wyrcester p Hall fol Habington p Holingshed p Polyd Virg p  Thus an extensive and dangerous combination was insensibly formed against Edward and his ministry Tho' the object of the malecontents was not at present to overturn the throne it was difficult to foresee the extremities to which they might be carried and as opposition to an administration was always in those ages prosecuted by force of arms civil convulsions and disorders were likely to be soon the result of these intrigues and confederacies  Alliance with the duke of Burgundy  WHILE this cloud was gathering at home Edward carried his views abroad and endeavoured to secure himself against his factious nobility by entering into foreign alliances The dark and dangerous ambition of Lewis XI the more it was known the greater alarm it excited among all his neighbours and vassals and as it was supported by great abilities and unrestrained by any principles of faith or humanity they found no security to themselves but by a jealous combination against him Philip duke of Burgundy was now dead His rich and extensive dominions were devolved to Charles his only son whose martial disposition  acquired him the sirname of  Hardy  and whose ambition more outrageous than that of Lewis but seconded by less power and policy was regarded with a more favourable eye by the other powers of Europe The opposition of interests and still more a natural antipathy of character produced a declared animosity between these two bad princes and Edward was thus secure of the sincere attachment of either of them for whom he should choose to declare himself The duke of Burgundy being descended by his mother a daughter of Portugal from John of Gaunt was naturally inclined to favour the house of Lancaster  Comines liv chap  But this consideration was easily overballanced by politicks and Charles perceiving the interest of that house to be extremely decayed in England sent over his natural brother commonly called the bastard of Burgundy to carry in his name proposals of marriage to Margaret the King's sister The alliance of Burgundy was more popular with the English than that of France the commercial interests of the two nations invited the princes to a close union their common jealousy of Lewis was a natural cement between them  and Edward pleased with strengthening himself by so potent a confederate soon concluded the alliance and bestowed his sister upon Charles  Hall fol  A league which Edward at the same time concluded with the duke of Brittany seemed both to encrease his security and to open to him the prospect of rivalling his predecessors in those foreign conquests which however shortlived and unprofitable had rendered their reign so popular and illustrious  W Wyrcester p Parliament Hist vol p    BUT whatever ambitious schemes the King might have built on these alliances they were soon frustrated by intestine commotions which engrossed all his attention These disorders probably arose not immediately from the intrigues of the earl of Warwic but from accident assisted by the turbulent spirit of the age by the general humour of discontent which that popular nobleman had instilled into the nation and perhaps by some remains of attachment to the house of Lancaster  Insurrection in Yorkshire  The hospital of St Leonards near York had received from an antient grant of King Athelstane a right of levying a thrave of corn from every ploughland in the county and as these charitable establishments are very liable to abuse the country people complained that the revenue of the hospital was no longer expended for the relief of the poor but was secreted by the managers and employed for their private purposes After long repining at the contribution they refused payment Ecclesiastical and civil censures were issued against them Their goods were distrained and their persons thrown into jail Till as their illhumour  daily encreased they rose in arms fell upon the officers of the hospital whom they put to the sword and proceeded in a body fifteen thousand strong to the gates of York  Hall fol Holingshed p Polyd Virg p  The lord Montague who commanded in those parts opposed himself to their progress and having been so fortunate in a skirmish as to seize Robert Hulderne their leader he ordered him immediately to be led to execution according to the barbarous and illegal practice of those times  Grafton p  The rebels however still continued in arms and being soon headed by men of greater distinction Sir Henry Nevil son of lord Latimer and Sir John Coniers they advanced southwards and began to appear dangerous to the government Herbert earl of Pembroke who had received that title on the forfeiture of Jasper Tudor was ordered by Edward to march against them at the head of a body of Welshmen and he was joined by five thousand archers under the command of Stafford earl of Devonshire who had succeeded in that title to the family of Courtney which had also been forfeited But a trivial difference about quarters having begot an animosity between these two noblemen the earl of Devonshire retired with his archers and left Pembroke alone to encounter the rebels  Stowe p Holingshed p Fragm ad finem Sprotti  The two armies approached near Banbury  Battle of Banbury  and

Grafton p  The King imputing this misfortune to the earl of Devonshire who had deserted Pembroke ordered him to be executed in a like summary manner But these speedy executions or rather open murders did not stop there The northern rebels sending a party to Grafton seized the earl of Rivers and his son John men who had become obnoxious by their near relation to the King and his partiality towards them And these noblemen were immediately executed by orders from Sir John Coniers  Fabian fol    THERE is no part of English history since the Conquest so obscure so uncertain so little authentic or consistent as that of the wars between the two Roses Historians differ about many material circumstances some events of the utmost consequence in which they almost all agree are incredible and contradicted by records  We shall give an instance Almost all the historians even Comines and the continuator of the annals of Croyland assert that Edward was about this time taken prisoner by Clarence and Warwic and was committed to the custody of the archbishop of York brother to the earl but being allowed to take the diversion of hunting by this prelate he made his escape and afterwards chaced the rebels out of the kingdom But that all the story is false appears from Rymer where we find that the King throughout all this period continually exercised his authority and never was interrupted in his government On the th of March he gives a commission of array to Clarence whom he then imagined a good subject and on the d of the same month we find him issuing an order for apprehending him Besides in the King's manifesto against the duke and earl Claus Edw IV m where he enumerates all their treasons he mentions no such fact He does not so much as accuse them of exciting young Welles's rebellion He only says that they exhorted him to continue in his rebellion We may judge how smaller facts will be misrepresented by historians who can in the most material transactions mistake so grossly There may even some scruple arise with regard to the proposals of marriage made to Bona of Savoy tho' almost all the historians concur in it and the fact be very likely in itself For there are no traces in Rymer of any such embassy of Warwic's to France The chief certainty in this and the preceding reign arises either from public records or from the notice taken of certain passages by the French historians On the contrary for some centuries after the Conquest the French history is not compleat without the assistance of English authors  and it is remarkable that this profound darkness falls upon us just on  the eve of the restoration of letters and when the art of Printing was already known in Europe All we can distinguish with certainty thro' the deep cloud which covers that period is a scene of horror and bloodshed savage manners arbitrary executions and treacherous dishonourable conduct in all parties There is no possibility for instance of accounting for the views and intentions of the earl of Warwic at this time It is agreed that he resided with his son in law the duke of Clarence in his government of Calais during the commencement of this rebellion and that his brother Montague acted with vigour against the northern rebels We may thence presume that the insurrection had not proceeded from the secret councils and instigation of Warwic tho' the murder committed by the rebels on the earl of Rivers his capital enemy forms on the other hand a violent presumption against him He and Clarence came over to England offered their service to Edward were received without any suspicion were entrusted by him in the highest commands  Rymer vol p  and still persevered in their fidelity Soon after we find the rebels quieted and dispersed by a general pardon granted by Edward from the advice of the earl of Warwic But why so courageous a prince if secure of Warwic's fidelity should have granted a general pardon to men who had been guilty of such violent and personal outrages against him is not intelligible nor why that nobleman if unfaithful should have endeavoured to appease a rebellion of which he was able to make such advantages But it appears that after this insurrection there was an interval of peace during which the King loaded the family of Nevil with honours and favours of the highest nature He made the lord Montague a marquess by the same name He created his son George duke of Bedford  Cotton p  He declared publicly his intention  of marrying that young nobleman to his eldest daughter Elizabeth who as he had yet no sons was the presumptive heir of the crown Yet we find that soon after being invited to a feast by the archbishop of York a younger brother of Warwic and Montague he entertained a sudden suspicion that they intended to seize his person or to murder him And he abruptly departed from the entertainment  Fragm E IV ad fin Sprotti    SOON after there broke out another rebellion which is as unaccountable as all the preceding events chiefly because no sufficient reason is assigned for it and because so far as it appears the family of Nevil had no hand in exciting and fomenting it It arose in Lincolnshire and was headed by Sir Robert Welles son to the lord of that name The army of the rebels amounted to men but the lord Welles himself far from giving countenance to them fled into a sanctuary in order to secure his person against the King's anger or suspicions He was drawn from this retreat by a promise of safety and was soon after notwithstanding this assurance beheaded along with Sir Thomas Dymoc by orders from Edward  Hall fol Fabian fol Habington p Holingshed p    th March  The King fought a battle with the rebels defeated them took Sir Robert Welles and Sir Thomas Launde prisoners and ordered them immediately to be beheaded  EDWARD during these transactions had so little jealousy of the earl of Warwic or duke of Clarence that he granted them commissions of array for levying forces against the rebels  Rymer vol p  But these noblemen so soon as they left the court raised troops in their own name issued declarations against the government and complained of grievances oppressions and bad ministers The unexpected defeat of Welles disconcerted all their measures and they retired northwards into Lancashire where they expected to be joined by lord Stanley who had married the earl of Warwic's sister  Warwic and Clarence banished  But as that nobleman refused all concurrence with them and as lord Montague also remained quiet in Yorkshire they were obliged to dissolve their army and to fly into Devonshire where they embarked and made sail towards Calais  The King offered by proclamation a reward of pounds or pounds a year in land to any that would seize them Whence we may learn that land was at that time sold for about ten years purchase See Rymer vol p    THE deputy governor whom Warwic had left at Calais was one Vaucler a Gascon who seeing the earl return in this miserable condition refused him admission into the place and would not so much as permit the dutchess of Clarence  to land tho' a few days before she had been delivered on ship board of a son and was at that time extremely disordered by sickness With difficulty he would allow a few flaggons of wine to be carried to the ship for the use of the ladies But as he was a man of sagacity and well acquainted with the revolutions to which England was subject he secretly apologized to Warwic for this appearance of infidelity and represented it as proceeding entirely from zeal for his service He said that the place was ill supplied with provisions that he could not depend on the attachment of the garrison that the inhabitants who lived by the English commerce would certainly declare for the established government that the place was at present unable to resist the power of England on the one hand and that of the duke of Burgundy on the other and that by seeming to declare for Edward he would acquire the confidence of that prince and still keep it in his power when it should become safe and prudent to restore the fortress to its antient master  Comines liv chap Hall fol  It is uncertain whether Warwic was satisfied with this apology or suspected a double infidelity in Vaucler but he feigned to be entirely convinced by him and having seized some Flemish vessels which he found lying off Calais he immediately made sail towards France  THE King of France uneasy at the close conjunction between Edward and the duke of Burgundy received with the greatest demonstrations of regard and friendship the unfortunate Warwic  Polyd Virg p  with whom he had formerly maintained a secret correspondence and whom he hoped still to make his instrument in overturning the government of England and reestablishing the house of Lancaster No animosity was ever greater than that which had long prevailed between that house and the earl of Warwic His father had been executed by orders from Margaret He himself had twice reduced Henry to captivity had banished the queen had put to death all their most zealous partizans either in the field or on the scaffold and had occasioned innumerable ills to that unhappy family For this reason believing that such inveterate rancour would never admit of any cordial reconciliation he had not mentioned Henry's name when he took arms against Edward and he rather endeavoured to prevail by means of his own adherents than revive a party which he sincerely hated But his present distresses and the entreaties of Lewis made him hearken to terms of accommodation and Margaret being sent for from Angers where she then resided an agreement was from common interest soon formed between them It was stipulated that Warwic should adopt the cause of Henry and endeavour to restore him to liberty and to reestablish him on the throne that the administration of the government during the minority of young Edward Henry's son should reside  conjointly in the earl of Warwic and duke of Clarence that prince Edward should marry the lady Anne second daughter of that nobleman and that the crown in case of the failure of maleissue in that prince should descend to the duke of Clarence to the entire exclusion of King Edward and his posterity Never was confederacy on all sides less natural or more evidently the work of necessity But Warwic hoped that all former passions of the Lancastrians might be lost in present political views and that at worst the independant power of his family and the affections of the people would be able to give him security and enable him to exact the full performance of all the conditions agreed on The marriage of prince Edward with the lady Anne was immediately celebrated in France  EDWARD reasonably foresaw that it would be easy to dissolve an alliance composed of such discordant parts For this purpose he sent over a lady of great sagacity and address who belonged to the train of the dutchess of Clarence and who under colour of attending her mistress was empowered to negotiate with the duke and renew the connexions of that prince with his own family  Comines liv chap Hall fol Holingshed p  She represented to Clarence that he had unwarily to his own ruin become the instrument of Warwic's vengeance and had thrown himself entirely in the power of his most inveterate enemies that the mortal injuries which the one royal family had suffered from the other were now past all forgiveness and no idea of an imaginary union in interests could ever suffice to obliterate them that even if the leaders were willing to forget past offences the animosity of their adherents would prevent a sincere coalition of parties and would in spite of all temporary and verbal agreements preserve an eternal opposition of measures between them and that a prince who deserted his own kindred and joined the murderers of his father left himself single without friends without protection and would not when misfortunes inevitably fell upon him be so much as entitled to any pity or regard from the rest of mankind Clarence was only one and twenty years of age and seems to have possessed but a slender capacity yet he could easily see the force of these reasons and on the promise of forgiveness and favour from his brother he secretly engaged on a favourable opportunity to desert the earl of Warwic and abandon the Lancastrian party  DURING this negotiation Warwic was secretly carrying on a correspondence of the same nature with his brother the marquess of Montague who was entirely trusted by Edward and like motives produced a like resolution in that nobleman The marquess also that he might render the projected blow the more  deadly and incurable resolved on his side to watch a favourable opportunity for committing  his  perfidy and still to maintain the appearance of being a zealous adherent to the house of York  AFTER these mutual snares were thus carefully laid the decision of the quarrel advanced apace Lewis prepared a fleet to escort the earl of Warwic and offered him a supply of men and money  Comines liv chap Hall fol  The duke of Burgundy on the other hand enraged at that nobleman for his seizure of the Flemish ships before Calais and anxious to support the reigning family in England with whom his own interests were now collected fitted out a larger fleet with which he guarded the Channel and he incessantly warned his brother in law of the imminent perils to which he was exposed But Edward tho' always brave and often active had very little foresight or penetration He was not sensible of his danger He made no suitable preparations against the earl of Warwic  Grafton p  He even said that the duke might spare himself the trouble of guarding the seas and that he wished for nothing more than to see Warwic set foot on English ground  Comines liv chap Hall fol  A vain confidence in his own prowess joined to the immoderate love of pleasure had made him incapable of all sound reason and reflection  Septr Warwic and Clarence return  THE event soon happened of which Edward seemed so desirous A storm dispersed the Flemish navy and left the seas open to Warwic  Comines liv chap  That nobleman seized the opportunity and setting sail quickly landed at Dartmouth with the duke of Clarence the earls of Oxford and Pembroke and a small body of troops while the King was in the north engaged in suppressing an insurrection which had been raised by the lord FitzHugh brother in law to Warwic The scene which ensues seems more like the fiction of a poem or romance than an event in true history The prodigious popularity of Warwic  Hall fol  the zeal of the Lancastrian party the spirit of discontent with which many were infected and the general instability of the English nation occasioned by the late frequent revolutions drew such multitudes to his standard that in a very few days his army amounted to sixty thousand men and was continually encreasing Edward hastened southwards to encounter him and the two armies approached each other near Nottingham where a decisive action was every moment expected The rapidity of Warwic's progress had incapacitated the duke of Clarence from executing  his  plan of treachery and the marquess of Montague had here the opportunity of striking the first blow He communicated the design to his adherents who promised him their concurrence They took to arms in the night time and hastened with loud acclamations to Edward's quarters The King was alarmed at  the noise and starting from his bed heard the cry of war usually employed by the Lancastrian party Lord Hastings his chamberlain informed him of the danger and urged him to make his escape by speedy flight from an army where he had so many concealed enemies and where few seemed to be zealously attached to his service He had just time to get on horseback and to hurry with a small retinue to Lynne in Norfolk where he luckily found some ships ready on board which he presently embarked  Comines liv chap Hall fol    Edward IV expelled  And after this manner the earl of Warwic in no longer space than eleven days after his first landing was left entire master of the kingdom  BUT Edward's danger did not end with his embarkation The Easterlings or HanseTowns were then at war both with France and England and some ships of these people hovering on the English coast espied the King's vessels and gave chace to them nor was it without extreme difficulty that he made his escape into the port of Alcmaer in Holland He had fled from England with such precipitation that he had carried nothing of value along with him and the only reward which he could bestow on the captain of the vessel that brought him over was a robe lined with sables promising him an ample recompence if fortune should ever become more propitious to him  Comines liv chap    IT is not likely that Edward could be very fond of presenting himself in this lamentable condition before the duke of Burgundy and that having so suddenly after his mighty vaunts lost all footing in his own kingdom he could be insensible to the ridicule which must attend him in the eyes of that prince The duke on his part was no less embarrassed how he should receive the dethroned monarch As he had ever borne a greater affection to the house of Lancaster than to that of York nothing but political views had engaged him to contract an alliance with the latter family and he foresaw that probably the revolution in England would now turn this alliance against him and render the reigning family in that kingdom his implacable and jealous enemy For this reason when the first rumor of that event reached him attended with the circumstance of Edward's death he seemed rather pleased with the catastrophe and it was no agreeable disappointment to find that he must either undergo the burthen of supporting an exiled prince or the dishonour of abandoning so near a relation  Comines liv chap Habington p  He began already to say that his connexions were with the kingdom of England not with the King and that it was indifferent to him whether the name of Edward or that of Henry was employed in the articles of treaty  Comines liv chap Hall fol  These  sentiments were continually strengthened by the subsequent events Vaucler the deputy governor of Calais tho' he had been confirmed in his command by Edward and even received an annual pension from the duke of Burgundy on account of his fidelity to the crown  Grafton p  no sooner saw his old master Warwic reinstated in authority than he declared for him and with great demonstrations of zeal and attachment put the whole garrison in his livery  Comines liv chap Hall fol  And the intelligence which the duke received every day from England seemed to promise an entire and full settlement in the family of Lancaster  Henry VI restored  IMMEDIATELY after Edward's flight had left the kingdom entirely at Warwic's disposal that nobleman hastened to London and taking Henry from his confinement in the Tower into which he had been the chief cause of throwing him he proclaimed him King with great solemnity A parliament was summoned in the name of that prince to meet at Westminster and as this assembly could pretend to no liberty amidst such enraged factions governed by such an impetuous spirit as Warwic their votes were entirely dictated by the ruling party  Grafton p Fabian fol Polyd Virg p  The treaty with Margaret was here fully executed Henry was recognized for lawful King but his incapacity for government being avowed the regency was entrusted to Warwic and Clarence till the majority of prince Edward and in default of that prince's issue Clarence was declared successor to the crown The usual business also of reversals went on without opposition Every statute made during the reign of Edward was repealed that prince was declared to be an usurper he and his adherents were attainted and in particular Richard duke of Glocester his younger brother All the attainders of the Lancastrians the dukes of Somerset and Exeter the earls of Richmond Pembroke Oxford and Ormond were reversed and every one was restored who had lost either honours or fortune by his former adherence to the cause of Henry  THE ruling party were more sparing in their executions than was usual after any revolution during those violent times The only victim of distinction was John Tibetot earl of Worcester constable of England This accomplished person born in an age and nation where the nobility valued themselves on ignorance as their privilege and left learning to monks and schoolmasters for whom indeed the spurious erudition that prevailed was best fitted had been struck with the first rays of true science which began to penetrate from the south and had been zealous by his exhortations and example to propagate the love of letters among his unpolished countrymen It is pretended that knowledge had not produced on this nobleman himself the effect which so naturally attends it of humanizing  the temper and softening the heart  Hall fol Stowe p  and that he had enraged the Lancastrians against him by the severities which he exercised upon them during the prevalence of his own party He endeavoured to conceal himself after the flight of Edward but was caught on the top of a tree in the forest of Weybridge was conducted to London tried before the earl of Oxford condemned and executed All the other considerable Yorkists either fled beyond sea or took shelter in sanctuaries where the ecclesiastical privileges offered them protection In London alone it is computed that no less than persons saved themselves in this manner  Comines liv chap  and among the rest Edward's Queen who was there delivered of a son called by his father's name  Hall fol Stowe p Holingshed p Grafton p    QUEEN Margaret the other rival Queen had not yet appeared in England but on receiving intelligence of Warwic's success was preparing with prince Edward for her journey All the banished Lancastrians flocked to her and among the rest the duke of Somerset son to the duke beheaded after the battle of Hexham This nobleman who had long been regarded as head of the party had fled into the Low Countries on the discomfiture of his friends and as he concealed his name and quality he had languished in the most extreme want and indigence Philip de Comines tells us  Liv chap  that he himself there saw him as well as the duke of Exeter in a condition no better than that of the meanest beggar till being discovered by Philip duke of Burgundy they had small pensions allowed them and were living in silence and obscurity when the success of their party called them from their retreat But both Somerset and Margaret were detained by contrary winds from reaching England  Grafton p Polyd Virg p  till a new revolution in that kingdom no less sudden and surprizing than the former threw them into greater misery than that from which they had just emerged  THO' the duke of Burgundy by neglecting Edward and paying court to the established government had endeavoured to conciliate the friendship of the Lancastrians he found that they had not succeeded to his wish and the antient connexions between the King of France and the earl of Warwic still held him in great doubt and anxiety  Hall fol  This nobleman too hastily regarding Charles as his determined enemy had sent over to Calais a body of men who committed inroads on the Lowcountries  Comines liv chap  and the duke of Burgundy saw himself in danger of being oppressed by the united arms of France and of England He resolved therefore to grant some assistance to his brotherin law but in such a covert manner as should give the least offence possible to the government of England  He equipped four large vessels in the name of some private merchants at Terveer in Zealand and causing fourteen ships to be secretly hired of the Easterlings he delivered this small squadron to Edward who receiving also a sum of money from the duke immediately set sail for England No sooner was Charles informed of his departure than he issued a proclamation inhibiting all his subjects to give him countenance or assistance  Comines liv  chap  an artifice which could not blind the earl of Warwic but which might serve as a decent pretence if he was so disposed for maintaining friendship with the house of Burgundy  EDWARD impatient to take revenge of his enemies and to recover his lost authority made an attempt to land with his forces which exceeded not men on the coast of Norfolk but being there repulsed  Holingshed p  he sailed northwards and disembarked at Ravenspur in Yorkshire  March    Finding that the new magistrates who had been placed in authority by the earl of Warwic kept the people from joining him he pretended and even made oath that he came not to challenge the crown but only the inheritance of the house of York which of right belonged to him and that he did not intend to raise a civil war in the kingdom  Hall fol Habington p  H  shed p Grafton p Fabian fol  His partizans every moment flocked to his standard He was admitted into the city of York  Polyd Virg p    vol p  And he was soon in a situation which gave him hopes of success in all his claims and pretensions The marquis of Montague commanded in the northern counties but from some mysterious reasons which as well as many other important transactions in that age no historian has cleared up he totally neglected the beginnings of an insurrection which he ought to have esteemed so formidable  Hall fol Habington p Holing  p  Polyd Virg p  Warwic assembled an army at Leicester with an intention of meeting and of giving battle to the enemy but Edward by taking another road passed him unmolested and presented himself before the gates of London Had he here been refused admittance he was totally ruined But there were many causes which inclined the citizens to favour him His numerous friends issuing forth from their sanctuaries were active in his cause many rich merchants who had formerly lent him money saw no other chance for their payment but his restoration the citydames who had been liberal of their favours to him and who still retained an affection for this young and gallant prince swayed their husbands and friends in his behalf  Comines liv chap    and above all the archbishop of York Warwic's brother to whom the care of the city was committed had secretly from unknown reasons entered into a correspondence with him and he facilitated Edward's admission  into London The most likely cause which can be assigned for those multiplied infidelities even in the family itself of Nevil is the spirit of faction which when it becomes inveterate it is very difficult for any man entirely to shake off These persons who had long distinguished themselves in the York party were unable to act with zeal and cordiality for the support of the Lancastrians and they were inclined by every prospect of favour or accommodation offered them by Edward to return to their antient connexions However this may be Edward's entrance into London made him master not only of that rich and powerful city but also of the person of Henry who destined to be the perpetual sport of fortune thus fell again into the hands of his enemies  Grafton p    IT appears not that Warwic during his short administration which had continued only six months had been guilty of any unpopular acts or had any wise deserved to forfeit that general favour with which he had so lately overwhelmed Edward But this prince who was formerly the defendant was now the aggressor and having overcome the difficulties which always attend the beginnings of an insurrection possessed many advantages above his enemy His partizans were actuated by that zeal and courage which the notion of an attack inspires his opponents were intimidated for a like reason every one who had been disappointed in the hopes which he had entertained from Warwic's elevation either became a cool friend or an open enemy to that nobleman and each malecontent from whatever cause proved an accession to Edward's army The King therefore found himself in a condition to face the earl of Warwic who being reinforced by his son inlaw the duke of Clarence and his brother the marquis of Montague took post at Barnet in the neighbourhood of London The arrival of Queen Margaret was every day expected who would have drawn together all the true Lancastrians and have brought a mighty accession to Warwic's forces But this very consideration proved a motive to the earl rather to hurry on a decisive action than to share the victory with rivals and antient enemies who he foresaw would in case of success claim the chief merit in the enterprize  Comines liv chap  But while his jealousy was all directed towards that side he overlooked the dangerous infidelity of friends who lay the nearest to his bosom His brother Montague who had lately temporized seems now to have remained sincerely attached to the interests of his family But his son in law tho' bound to him by every tye of honour and gratitude tho' he shared the power of the regency tho' he had been invested by Warwic in all the honours and patrimony of the house of York resolved to fulfil the secret engagements which he had formerly taken with his brother and to support the interests of his own family He de  erted to  the King in the nighttime and carried over a body of men along with him  Grafton p  Comines liv chap Leland's Collect

Barnet and death of Warw  c  The battle was fought with great obstinacy on both sides The two armies in imitation of their leaders exerted uncommon acts of valour And the victory remained long undecided between them But an accident threw at last the balance to the side of the Yorkists Edward's cognisance was a sun that of Warwic a star with rays and the mistiness of the morning rendering it difficult to distinguish them John earl of Oxford who fought on the side of the Lancastrians was by mistake attacked by his friends and chaced off the field of battle  Habing  p    Warwic contrary to his more usual practice engaged that day on foot resolving to show his army that he meant to share every fortune with them and he was slain in the thickest of the engagement  Comines liv chap  His

by a small body of French forces When this princess received intelligence of her husband's captivity and of the defeat and death of the earl of Warwic her courage which had supported her under so many

Poly Virg p  but being encouraged by the appearance of Tudor earl of Pembroke and Courtney earl of Devonshire of the lords Wenloc and St John with other men of rank who exhorted her still to hope for success she resumed her former spirit and determined to defend to the utmost the ruins of her fallen fortunes She advanced thro' the counties of Devon Somerset and Glocester encreasing her army on each day's march but was at last overtaken by the rapid and expeditious Edward at Teukesbury on the banks of the Severne  of Teu    May  The Lancastrians were here totally defeated The earl of Devonshire and lord Wenloc were killed in the field The duke of Somerset and about twenty other persons of distinction having taken shelter in a church were surrounded dragged out and immediately beheaded About of their side fell in battle And the army was entirely dispersed  QUEEN Margaret and her son were taken prisoners and brought to the King who asked the prince after an insulting manner how he dared to invade his dominions The young prince more mindful of his high birth than of his present fortune replied that he came thither to claim his just inheritance The ungenerous Edward insensible to pity struck him on the face with his gauntlet and the dukes of Clarence and Glocester lord Hastings and sir Thomas Gray taking the blow as a signal for farther violence hurried the

Glocester killed him with his own hands  Comines Hall fol Grafton p    Death of Henry VI  But the universal odium under which that prince's memory deservedly labours inclined perhaps the nation to aggravate his crimes without any sufficient authority It is certain however that Henry's death was very sudden and tho' he laboured before under an ill state of health this circumstance joined to the general manners of the age gave a very natural ground of suspicion which was rather increased than diminished by the exposing of his body to public view That precaution served only to recal many similar instances in the English history and to suggest the comparison  ALL the hopes of the Lancastrians seemed now to be utterly extinguished Every legitimate prince of that family was dead Almost all the great leaders of the party had perished in battle or on the scaffold Jasper earl of Pembroke who was levying forces in Wales dispersed his army when he received intelligence of the battle of Teukesbury and he fled into Brittany with his nephew the young earl of Richmond  Habington p Polyd Virg p  The bastard of Falconbrige who had levied some forces and advanced to London during Edward's absence was repulsed his men deserted him he was taken prisoner and immediately executed  Holingshed p Hist Croyl cont p  And peace being now fully restored to the nation a parliament was summoned which ratified as usual all the acts of the victor and recognized his legal authority  th Octr  BUT this prince who had been so firm and active and intrepid during the course of adversity was still unable to resist the allurements of a prosperous fortune and he wholly devoted himself as before to pleasure and amusement after he became entirely master of his kingdom and had no longer any enemy who could give him anxiety or alarm He recovered however by this gay and inoffensive course of life and by his easy familiar manners that popularity which  it is natural to imagine he had lost by the repeated cruelties exercised upon his enemies and the example also of his jovial festivity served to abate the former acrimony of faction among his subjects and to restore the social disposition which had been so long interrupted between the opposite parties All men seemed to be fully satisfied with the present government and the memory of past calamities served only to impress the people more strongly with a sense of their allegiance and with the resolution of never incurring any more the hazard of renewing such direful scenes  BUT while the King was thus indulging himself in pleasure he was rouzed from the lethargy by a prospect of foreign conquests which it is probable his desire of popularity more than the spirit of ambition had made him covet Tho' he deemed himself very little beholden to the duke of Burgundy for the reception which that prince had given him during his exile  Comines liv chap  the political interests of their states maintained still a close connexion between them and they agreed to unite their arms in making a powerful invasion on France A league was formed in which Edward stipulated to pass the seas with an army exceeding men and to invade the French territories Charles promised to join him with all his forces The King was to challenge the crown of France and to obtain at least the provinces of Normandy and Guienne The duke was to acquire Champaigne and some other territories and to free all his dominions from the burthen of homage to the crown of France And neither party was to make peace without the consent of the other  Rymer vol p c  They were the more encouraged to hope for success from this league as the count de St Pol constable of France who was master of St Quintin and some towns on the Somme had secretly promised them his assistance and there were also hopes of engaging the duke of Brittany to enter into the confederacy  THE prospect of a French war was always a sure means of making the parliament open their purses as far as the habits of that age would permit They voted the King a tenth of rents or two shillings in the pound which must have been very inaccurately levied since it produced only pounds and they added to this supply a whole fifteenth and three quarters of another  Cotton p Hist Croyl cont  But as the King deemed these sums still unequal to the undertaking he attempted to levy money by the way of  benevolence  a sort of exaction which except during the reign of Henry III had scarce ever been practiced in former times and which tho' the consent of the parties was pretended to be gained could not be esteemed  entirely voluntary  Hall fol Habington p Grafton p Fabian fol  The clauses annexed to the parliamentary grant show sufficiently the spirit of the nation in this respect The money levied by the fifteenth was not to be put into the King's hands but to be kept in religious houses and if the expedition into France did not take place it was immediately to be refunded to the people After these grants the parliament was dissolved which had sat near two years and a half and had undergone several prorogations a practice not very usual at that time in England  Invasion of France  THE King passed over to Calais with an army of men at arms and archers attended with all the chief nobility of England who prognosticating future successes from the past were eager to appear in this great theatre of honour  Comines liv chap This author says chap that the King artfully brought over some of the richest of his subjects who he knew would be soon tired of the war and would promote all proposals of peace which he foresaw would soon become necessary  But all their sanguine hopes were damped when they found on entering the French territories that neither the constable opened his gates to them nor did the duke of Burgundy bring them the smallest assistance That prince transported by his ardent temper had carried all his armies to a great distance and had employed them in wars on the frontiers of Germany and against the duke of Lorrain and tho' he came in person to Edward and endeavoured to apologize for this breach of treaty there was no prospect that they would be able this campaign to make a conjunction with the English This circumstance gave great disgust to the King and inclined him to hearken to those advances which Lewis continually made him for an accommodation  THAT monarch more swayed by political views than by the point of honour deemed no submissions too mean which could free him from enemies who had proved so formidable to his predecessors and who united to so many other enemies might still shake the well established government of France It appears from Comines that discipline was at this time very imperfect among the English and that their civil wars tho' long continued yet being always decided by hasty battles had still left them ignorant of the improvements which the military art was beginning to receive upon the continent  Comines liv chap  But as Lewis was sensible that the warlike genius of the people would soon render them excellent soldiers he was far from despising them for their present want of experience and he employed all his art to detach them from their alliance with Burgundy When Edward sent a herald to claim the crown of France and to carry him a defiance in case of refusal so far from answering to this bravado in like haughty terms he replied with great temper and even made the herald a considerable present  Comines liv chap Hall fol  He took  afterwards an opportunity of sending a herald to the English camp and giving him directions to apply to the lords Stanley and Howard who he heard were friends to peace he desired the good offices of these noblemen in promoting an accommodation with their master  Comines liv chap    August  As Edward was now fallen into like dispositions a truce was soon concluded on terms more advantageous than honourable to Lewis He stipulated to pay Edward immediately crowns on condition that he should withdraw his army from France and promised to pay him crowns a year during their joint lives It was added that the Dauphin when of age should marry Edward's eldest daughter  Rymer vol p    Peace of Pecquigni  In order to ratify this treaty the two monarchs agreed to have a personal interview and for this purpose suitable preparations were made at Pecquigni near Amiens A close rail was drawn across a bridge in that place with no larger intervals than would allow the arm to pass a precaution which was used to prevent a like accident with that which happened to John duke of Burgundy in his conference with the Dauphin at Montereau Edward and Lewis came to the opposite sides conferred privately together and having confirmed their friendship and interchanged many mutual civilities they soon after parted  Comines liv chap    LEWIS was anxious not only to gain the King's friendship but also that of the nation and of all the considerable persons in the English court He bestowed pensions to the amount of crowns a year on several of the King's favourites on lord Hastings two thousand crowns on lord Howard and others in proportion and these great ministers were not ashamed thus to receive wages from a foreign prince  Hall fol  As the two armies after the conclusion of the truce remained some time in the neighbourhood of each other the English were not only admitted freely into Amiens where Lewis resided but had also all their charges defrayed and had wine and victuals furnished them in every inn without any payments being demanded They flocked thither in such multitudes that once above nine thousand of them were in the town and they might have made themselves masters of the King's person but Lewis concluding from their careless and dissolute manner of living that they had no bad intentions was careful not to betray the least signs of fear or jealousy And when Edward informed of this disorder desired him to shut the gates against them he replied that he would never agree to exclude the English from the place where he resided but Edward if he pleased might recall them and place his own officers at the gates of Amiens to prevent their returning  Comines liv chap Hall fol    LEWIS's desire of confirming a mutual amity with England engaged him even to make imprudent advances which cost him afterwards some pains to evade In the conference at Pecquigni he had said to Edward that he wished to have a visit from him at Paris that he would there endeavour to amuse him with the ladies and that in case any offences were then committed he would assign him the cardinal of Bourbon for confessor who from fellowfeeling would not be over and above severe in the penances which he would injoin This hint made deeper impressions than Lewis intended Lord Howard who accompanied him back to Amiens told him in confidence that if he was so disposed it would not be impossible to persuade Edward to take a journey with him to Paris where they might make merry together Lewis pretended at first not to hear this offer but on Howard's repeating it he expressed his concern that his wars with the duke of Burgundy would not permit him to attend his royal guest and do him the honours he intended  "Edward"  said he privately to Comines  "is a very handsome and a very amorous prince Some lady at Paris may like him as well as he shall do her and may invite him to return in another manner It is better that the sea should be between us"  Comines liv chap Habington p  THIS treaty did very little honour to either of these monarchs It discovered the imprudence of Edward who had taken his measures so ill with his allies as to be obliged after such expensive preparations to return without making any acquisitions equivalent to them It showed the want of dignity in Lewis who rather than run the hazard of a battle agreed to subject his kingdom to a tribute and thus acknowledge the superiority of a neighbouring prince possessed of much less power and territory than himself But as Lewis made interest the sole test of honour he thought that all the advantages of the treaty were on his side and that he had overreached Edward by sending him out of France on such easy terms For this reason he was very solicitous to conceal his triumph and he strictly enjoined his courtiers never to show the English the least sign of mockery or ridicule against them But he did not himself very carefully observe so prudent a rule He could not forbear one day in the joy of his heart throwing out some raillery on the easy simplicity of Edward and his council When he perceived that he was overheard by a Gascon who had settled in England He was immediately sensible of the blunder sent a message to the gentleman and offered him such advantages in his own country as engaged him to remain in France  It is but just  said he  that I pay the penalty of my talkativeness  Comines liv chap    THE most honourable part of Lewis's treaty with Edward was the stipulation for the liberty of queen Margaret who tho' after the death of her husband and  son she could no longer be formidable to the government was still detained in custody by Edward Lewis paid fifty thousand crowns for her ranson and that princess who had been so active in the stage of the world and who had experienced such a variety of fortune passed the rest of her days in tranquillity and privacy till the year when she died An admirable princess but more illustrious by her undaunted spirit in adversity than by her moderation in prosperity She seems neither to have enjoyed the virtues nor been subject to the weaknesses of her sex and was as much tainted with the ferocity as endowed with the courage of that barbarous age in which she lived  THO' Edward had so little reason to be satisfied with the conduct of the duke of Burgundy he reserved to that prince a power of acceding to the treaty of Amiens But Charles when the offer was made him haughtily replied that he was able to support himself without the assistance of England and that he would make no peace with Lewis till three months after Edward's return into his own country This prince possessed all the ambition and courage of a conqueror but being defective in policy and prudence qualities no less essential he was unfortunate in all his enterprizes and perished at last in battle against the Swiss  Comines liv chap  a people whom he despised and who tho' brave and free had hitherto been in a manner overlooked in the general system of Europe  This event which happened in the year produced a great alteration in the views of all the princes and was attended with consequences which were felt for many generations Charles left only one daughter Mary by his first wife and this princess being heir of his opulent and extensive dominions was courted by all the potentates of Christendom who contended with each other for the possession of so rich a prize Lewis the head of her family might by a proper application have obtained this match for the Dauphin and have thereby united to the crown of France all the provinces of the Low Countries together with Burgundy Artois and Piccardy which would at once have rendered his kingdom an overmatch for all his neighbours But a man wholly interested is as rare as one entirely endowed with the opposite virtue and Lewis tho' impregnable to all the sentiments of generosity and friendship was on this occasion carried from the road of true policy by the passions of animosity and revenge He had imbibed so deep a hatred of the house of Burgundy that he chose rather to subdue the princess by force of arms than unite her to his family by marriage He conquered the dutchy of Burgundy and that part of Picardy which had been ceded to Philip the Good by the treaty of Arras But he forced the states of the Netherlands to bestow their sovereign in marriage on Maximilian of Austria son to the emperor  Frederic from whom they looked for protection in their present distresses And by these means France lost the opportunity which she never could recover of making that important acquisition of power and territory  DURING this interesting crisis Edward was no less defective in policy and was no less actuated by private passions unworthy of a sovereign and a statesman Jealousy of his brother Clarence had caused him to neglect the advances which were made of marrying that prince now a widower to the heiress of Burgundy  Polyd Virg Hall fol Holingshed p Habington p Grafton p  and he sent her proposals of espousing Anthony earl of Rivers brother to his queen who still retained an entire ascendant over him But the match was rejected with disdain  Hall fol  and Edward resenting this treatment of his brother in law permitted Lewis to proceed without interruption in his conquests over that defenceless ally Any pretence sufficed him for giving himself up entirely to indolence and pleasure which were now become his ruling passions The only object which divided his attention was the improving the revenues of the crown which had been extremely dilapidated by the necessities or negligence of his predecessors and some of his expedients for that purpose tho' unknown to us were deemed during the time oppressive to the people  Hall fol Hist Croyl cont p  The detail of private wrongs naturally escapes the notice of history but an act of tyranny of which Edward was guilty in his own family has been taken notice of by all historians and has met with very general and deserved censure  Trial and execution of the duke of Clarence  THE duke of Clarence by all his services in deserting Warwic had never been able to recover the King's friendship which he had forfeited by his former confederacy with that nobleman He was still regarded at court as a man of a dangerous and a fickle character and the imprudent openness and violence of his temper tho' it rendered him much less dangerous tended extremely to multiply his enemies and to enrage them against him Among these he had had the misfortune to give displeasure to the queen herself as well as to his brother the duke of Glocester a prince of the deepest policy of the most unrelenting ambition and the least scrupulous in the means which he employed for the attainment of his pernicious purposes A combination between these potent adversaries being secretly formed against Clarence it was determined to begin with attacking his friends in hopes that if he patiently suffered this injury his pusillanimity would dishonour him in the eyes of the public if he made resistance and expressed resentment his passion would betray him into measures which might give them advantages against him The King hunting one day in the park of Thomas Burdet of Arrow in Warwickshire had killed a white buck  which was a great favourite of the owner and Burdet vext at the loss broke into a passion and wished the horns of the deer in the belly of the person who had advised the King to commit that insult upon him This natural expression of resentment which would have been overlooked or forgotten had it come from any other person was rendered criminal and capital in that gentleman by the friendship in which he had the misfortune to live with the duke of Clarence He was tried for his life the judges and jury were found servile enough to condemn him and he was publickly beheaded at Tyburn for this pretended ofsence  Habington p  Holingshed p  Sir T More in Kennet p  About the same time one John Stacey an ecclesiastic much connected with the duke as well as with Burdet was exposed to a like iniquitous and barbarous persecution This person being more learned in mathematics and astronomy than was usual in that age lay under the reproach of necromancy with the ignorant vulgar and the tyrannical court laid hold of this popular rumor to effect his destruction He was tried in a court of justice for that imaginary crime many of the greatest peers countenanced the prosecution by their presence he was condemned put to the torture and executed  Hist Croyl cont p    THE duke of Clarence was alarmed when he found these acts of tyranny exercised on all around him He reflected on the fate of the good duke of Glocester in the last reign who after seeing the most infamous pretences employed for the destruction of his nearest connections at last fell himself a victim to the vengeance of his enemies  th Jan  But Clarence instead of securing his own life against the present danger by silence and reserve was open and loud in justifying the innocence of his friends and in exclaiming against the iniquity of their persecutors The King highly offended with his liberty or using that pretence against him committed him to the Tower  Hist Croyl cont p  summoned a parliament and tried him for his life before the house of peers the supreme tribunal of the nation  THE duke was accused of arraigning public justice by maintaining the innocence of men who had been condemned in courts of judicature and of inveighing against the iniquity of the King who had given orders for their prosecution  Stowe p  Many rash expressions were imputed to him and some too reflecting on his brother's legitimacy but he was not accused of any overt act of treason and even the truth of these speeches may be doubted since the liberty of judgment was taken from the court by the King's appearing personally as his brother's accuser and pleading the cause against him But a sentence of condemnation even when this extraordinary circumstance had not place was a necessary consequence  Hist Croyl cont p  quence in those times of any prosecution by the court or the prevailing party and the duke of Clarence was accordingly pronounced guilty by the peers The house of commons were no less slavish and unjust They both petitioned for the execution of the duke and afterwards passed a bill of attainder against him  Stow p Hist Croyl cont p  The measures of the parliament during that age furnish us with examples of a strange contrast of freedom and servility They scruple to grant and sometimes refuse to the King the smallest supplies the most necessary for the support of government even the most necessary for the maintenance of wars for which the nation as well as the parliament itself expressed a great fondness But they never scruple to concur in the most flagrant act of injustice or tyranny which falls on any individual however distinguished by birth or merit These maxims so ungenerous so opposite to all the principles of good government so contrary to the practice of present parliaments are very remarkable in all the transactions of the English history for more than a century after the period in which we are now engaged  THE only favour which the King granted his brother after his condemnation was to leave him the choice of his death  th Feb  and he was privately drowned in a But of Malmesey in the Tower A whimsical choice which implies that he had an extraordinary passion for that liquor The duke left two children by the eldest daughter of the earl of Warwic a son created an earl by his grandfather's title and a daughter afterwards countess of Salisbury Both this prince and princess were also unfortunate in their end and died violent deaths a fate which for many years attended almost all the descendants of the royal blood in England There prevails a report that a chief source of the violent prosecution of the duke of Clarence whose name was George was a current prophecy that the King's sons should be murdered by one the first letter of whose name was G  Hall fol Holingshed p  Grafton p Polyd Virg p Sir Thom More in Kennet p    It is not impossible that in those ignorant times such a silly reason might have influence But it is more probable that the whole story is the invention of a subsequent age and founded on the murder of these children by the duke of Glocester Comines remarks that at that time the English were never without some superstitious prophecy or other by which they accounted for every event  ALL the glories of Edward's reign terminated with the civil wars where his laurels too were extremely sullied with blood violence and cruelty His spirit seems afterwards to be sunk in indolence and pleasure or his measures were frustrated by imprudence and the want of foresight There was no object of which he was fonder than to have all his daughters settled by splendid marriages tho'  most of these princesses were yet in their infancy and tho' the completion of his v  ws it was obvious must depend on numberless accidents which were impossible to be foreseen or prevented His eldest daughter Elizabeth was contracted to the Dauphm his second Cicely to the eldest son of James III King of Scotland his third Anne to Philip the eldest son of Maximilian and the dutchess of Burgundy his fourth Catharine to John son and heir to Ferdinand King of Arragon and Isabella Queen of Castile  Rymer vol p  None of these projected marriages took place and the King himself saw in his lifetime the rupture of the first that with the Dauphin for which he had always discovered a peculiar fondness Lewis who paid no regard to treaties or engagements found his advantage in contracting the Dauphin to the princess Margaret the daughter of Maximilian and the King notwithstanding his indolence prepared himself to revenge this indignity  The French monarch eminent for prudence as well as falsehood endeavoured to guard against the blow and by a proper distribution of presents in the court of Scotland he excited James to make war upon England This weak prince who lived on bad terms with his own nobility and whose force was very unequal to the enterprize levied an army but when they were preparing to enter England the barons conspiring against his favourites put them to death without trial and the army presently dispersed The duke of Glocester attended by the duke of Albany James's brother who had been banished his country entered Scotland at the head of an army took Berwic and obliged the Scots to accept of a peace by which they resigned that fortress to Edward This success emboldened the King to think more seriously of a French war  th April Death and character of Edward IV  but while he was making preparations for that enterprize he wasseized with a distemper of which he expired in the forty second year of his age and the twenty third of his reign A prince more splendid and showy than either prudent or virtuous brave tho' cruel addicted to pleasure tho' capable of activity in great emergencies and less fitted to prevent ills by wise precautions than to remedy them after they took place by his vigour and enterprize Besides five daughters this King left two sons

RichmondBuckingham executedInvasion by the earl of RichmondBattle of BosworthDeath and character of Richard III  EDWARD V  State of the court  DURING the latter years of Edward IV the nation having in a great measure forgot the bloody feuds between the two Roses and acquiescing peaceably in the established government was only agitated by some courtintrigues which being restrained by the authority of the King seemed no wise to endanger the public tranquillity These intrigues arose from the perpetual rivalship between two parties the one consisting of the Queen and her relations particularly the earl of Rivers her brother and the marquiss of Dorset her son the other composed of the antient nobility who envied the sudden growth and unlimited credit of that aspiring family  Sir T More p  At the head of this latter party was the duke of Buckingham a man of very noble birth of ample possessions of great alliances of shining parts who tho' he had married the Queen's sister was too haughty to act in subserviency to her inclinations and aimed rather at maintaining an independant influence and authority Lord Hastings the chamberlain was another leader of the same party and as this nobleman had by his bravery and enterprize as well as by his approved fidelity acquired the confidence and favour of his master he had been able tho' with some difficulty to support himself against the credit of the Queen The lords Howard and Stanley maintained a connexion with these two noblemen and brought a considerable accession of influence and credit to their party All the other barons who had no  particular dependance on the Queen adhered to the same interest and the people in general from their natural envy against the prevailing power bore great favour to the cause of these noblemen  BUT Edward knew that tho' he himself had been able to overawe those rival factions many disorders might result from their contests during the minority of his son and he therefore took care in his last illness to summon together several of the leaders on both sides and by composing their antient quarrels to provide as far as possible for the future tranquillity of the government After expressing his intentions that his brother the duke of Glocester then absent in the north should be entrusted with the regency he recommended to them peace and unanimity during the tender years of his son represented to them the dangers which must attend the continuance of their animosities and engaged them to embrace each other with all the symptoms of the most cordial reconciliation But this temporary or feigned agreement lasted no longer than the King's life He had no sooner expired than the jealousies of the parties broke out afresh And each of them applied by separate messages to the duke of Glocester and endeavoured to acquire his favour and friendship  THIS prince during his brother's lifetime had endeavoured to live on good terms with both parties and his high birth his extensive abilities and his great services had enabled him to support himself without falling into a dependance on either But the new situation of affairs when the supreme power was devolved upon him immediately changed all his measures and he secretly determined to preserve no longer that neutrality which he had hitherto maintained His exorbitant ambition unrestrained by any principle either of justice or humanity made him carry his views to the possession of the crown itself and as this object could not be attained without the ruin of the Queen and her family he fell without hesitation into concert with the opposite party But being sensible that the most profound dissimulation was requisite to the effecting his criminal purposes he redoubled his professions of zeal and attachment to that princess and he gained such credit with her as to influence her conduct in a point which as it was of the utmost importance was violently disputed between the opposite factions  THE King at the time of his father's death resided in the castle of Ludlow on the borders of Wales whither he had been sent that the influence of his presence might overawe the Welsh and restore the tranquillity of that country which had been disturbed by some late commotions His person was committed to the care of his uncle the earl of Rivers the most accomplished nobleman in  England who having united an uncommon taste for literature  This nobleman first introduced the noble art of Printing into England Caxton was recommended by him to the patronage of Edward IV See Catalogue of royal and noble authors  to great abilities in business and valour in the field was intitled by his talents still more than by nearness of blood to direct the education of the young monarch The Queen anxious to preserve that ascendant over her son which she had so long maintained over her husband wrote to the earl of Rivers that he should levy a body of forces in order to escort the King to London to protect him during his coronation and to keep him from falling into the hands of their enemies The opposite faction sensible that Edward was now of an age when great advantages could be made of his name and countenance and was approaching to the age when he would be legally intitled to exert in person his authority foresaw that the tendency of this measure was to perpetuate their subjection under their rivals and they vehemently opposed a resolution which they represented as the signal for renewing a civil war in the kingdom Lord Hastings threatened instantly to depart to his government of Calais  Hist Croyl cont p  The other nobles seemed resolute to oppose force by force And as the duke of Glocester on pretence of pacifying the quarrel had declared against all appearance of an armed power which might be dangerous and was no wise necessary the Queen trusting to the sincerity of his friendship and overawed by so violent an opposition revoked her orders to her brother and desired him to bring up no greater retinue than would be necessary to support the state and dignity of the young sovereign  Sir T More p    THE duke of Glocester mean while set out from York attended by a numerous train of the northern gentry When he reached Northampton he was joined by the duke of Buckingham who was also attended by a splendid retinue and as he heard that the King was every hour expected on that road he resolved to await his arrival under colour of conducting him thence in person to London The earl of Rivers apprehensive that the place would be too narrow to contain so many attendants sent his pupil forward by another road to StonyStratford and came himself to Northampton in order to apologize for this measure and to pay his respects to the duke of Glocester He was received with the greatest appearance of cordiality He passed the evening in an amicable and friendly manner with Glocester and Buckingham He proceeded on the road with them next day to join the King  The earl of Rivers arrested st of May  But as he was entering StonyStratford he was arrested by orders of the duke of Glocester  Hist Croyl cont p  Sir Richard Gray one of the Queen's sons was at the same time put under a guard together with  Sir Thomas Vaughan who possessed a considerable office in the King's household and all the prisoners were instantly conducted to Pomfret Glocester approached the young prince with the greatest demonstrations of respect and endeavoured to satisfy him with regard to the violence committed on his uncle and brother But Edward much attached to these near relations by whom he had been tenderly educated was not such a master of dissimulation as to conceal his displeasure  Sir T More p      THE people however were extremely rejoiced at this revolution  th of May  and the duke was received in London with the loudest acclamations But the Queen no sooner received intelligence of her brother's imprisonment than she foresaw that Glocester's violence would not stop there and that her own ruin if not that of all her children was finally determined She therefore fled into the sanctuary of Westminster attended by the marquiss of Dorset and she carried thither the five princesses together with the duke of York  Hist Croyl cont p  She trusted that the ecclesiastical privileges which had formerly during the total ruin of her husband and family given her protection against the fury of the Lancastrian faction would not now be violated by her brotherinlaw while her son was seated on the throne and she resolved to await there the return of better fortune But Glocester anxious to have the duke of York in his power proposed to take him by force from the sanctuary and he represented to the privy council both the indignity put upon the government by the Queen's illgrounded apprehensions and the necessity of the young prince's appearance at the ensuing coronation of his brother It was farther alledged that ecclesiastical privileges were originally calculated only to give protection to unhappy men persecuted for their debts or crimes and were entirely useless to a person who by reason of his tender age could lie under the burden of neither and who for the same reason was utterly incapable of claiming security from any sanctuary But the two archbishops cardinal Bourchier the primate and Rotheram archbishop of York protesting against the sacrilege of this measure it was agreed that they should first endeavour to bring the Queen to compliance by persuasion before any violence should be employed against her These prelates were known to be persons of integrity and honour and being themselves entirely persuaded of the sincerity of the duke's intentions they employed every argument accompanied with zealous entreaties exhortations and assurances to bring her over to the same opinion She continued long obstinate and insisted that the duke of York by living in the sanctuary was not only secure himself but also gave security to the King whose life no one would dare to attempt while his successor and avenger remained in  safety But finding that no one supported her in her sentiments and that force in case of refusal was threatened by the council she at last complied and produced her son to the two prelates She was here on a sudden struck with a kind of presage of his future fate She tenderly embraced him she bedewed him with her tears and bidding him an eternal adieu delivered him with many expressions of regret and reluctance into their custody  Sir T More p    THE duke of Glocester being the nearest male of the royal family capable of exercising the government seemed fully intitled by the customs of the realm to the office of protector  Duke of Glocester protector  and the council not waiting for the consent of parliament installed him without scruple in that high dignity  Hist Croyl cont p    The general prejudice entertained by the nobility against the Queen and her kindred occasioned this precipitation and irregularity and no one foresaw any danger to the succession much less to the life of the infant princes from a measure so obvious and so natural Besides that the duke had hitherto been able to cover by the most profound dissimulation his fierce and savage nature the numerous issue of Edward together with the two children of Clarence seemed to be an eternal obstacle to his ambition and it appeared equally impracticable for him to dispatch so many persons possessed of a preferable title and imprudent to exclude them But a man who had abandoned all principles of honour and humanity was soon carried by his predominant passion beyond the reach of fear or precaution and Glocester having so far succeeded in his views no longer hesitated in removing the farther obstructions which lay between him and the crown The death of the earl of Rivers and of the other prisoners detained in Pomfret was first determined and he easily obtained the consent of the duke of Buckingham as well as of lord Hastings to this violent and sanguinary measure However easy it was in those illegal and barbarous times to obtain a sentence against the most innocent person it appeared still more easy to dispatch an enemy without any trial or form of process and orders were accordingly issued to Sir Richard Ratcliffe a proper instrument in the hands of this tyrant to cut off the heads of the noble prisoners The protector then assailed the fidelity of Buckingham by all the arguments capable of swaying a vicious mind which knew no motive of action but interest and ambition He represented that the murder of persons so nearly related to the King whom that prince professed so openly to love and whose injuries he so much resented would never pass unpunished and all the actors in that scene were bound in prudence to prevent the effects of his future vengeance That it would be impossible to keep the Queen for ever at a distance from her son and equally impossible to prevent her from instilling into his tender  mind the thoughts of retaliating by like executions the sanguinary insults committed on her family That the only method of obviating these mischiefs was by putting the sceptre into the hands of a man of whose friendship the duke might be assured and whose years and experience taught him to pay respect to merit and to the rights of antient nobility And that the same necessity which had carried them so far in resisting the usurpation of these intruders must justify them in attempting farther innovations and in making by national consent a new settlement of the succession To these reasons he added the offers of great private advantages to the duke of Buckingham and he easily obtained from him a promise of supporting him in all his enterprizes  THE duke of Glocester knowing the importance of gaining lord Hastings founded at a distance his sentiments by the means of one Catesby a lawyer who was a great confident of that nobleman but found him impregnable in his allegiance and fidelity to the children of Edward who had ever honoured him with his friendship  Sir T More p  He saw therefore that there was no longer any measures to be kept with him and he determined to ruin utterly the man whom he despaired of engaging to concur in his usurpation  th of June  On the very day when Rivers Gray and Vaughan were executed or rather murdered at Pomfret by Hastings's advice the protector summoned a council in the Tower whither that nobleman suspecting no design against him repaired without hesitation The duke of Glocester was capable of committing the most bloody and treacherous murders with the utmost coolness and indifference On taking his place at the councilboard he appeared in the easiest and most jovial humour in the world He seemed to indulge himself in familiar conversation with the counsellors before they should enter upon business and having paid some compliments to Morton bishop of Ely on the good and early strawberries which he raised in his garden at Holborn he begged the favour of having a dish of them which that prelate immediately dispatched a servant to bring him The protector then left the council as if called away by some other business but soon after returning with an angry and enflamed countenance he asked them what punishment those deserved that had plotted against  his  life who was so nearly related to the King and was entrusted with the administration of the government Hastings replied that they merited the punishment of traitors  These traitors  cried the protector  are the sorceress my brother's wife and Jane Shore his mistress with others their associates See to what a condition they have reduced me by their incantations and witchcraft  Upon which he laid bare his arm all shrivelled and decayed But the counsellors who knew that this infirmity had attended him from his birth  looked at each other in amazement and above all lord Hastings who as he had since Edward's death engaged in an intrigue with Jane Shore  Sir Thomas More who has been followed or rather transcribed by all the historians of this short reign says that Jane Shore had fallen into connexions with lord Hastings and this account agrees best with the course of the events But in a proclamation of Richard's to be found in Rymer vol p the marquis of Dorset is reproached with these connexions This reproach however might have been invented by Richard or founded only on popular rumour and is not sufficient to overbalance the authority of Sir Thomas More The proclamation is remarkable for the hypocritical purity of manners affected by Richard This bloody and treacherous tyrant upbraids the Marquis and others with their gallantries and intrigues as the most terrible enormities  was naturally anxious concerning the issue of these extraordinary proceedings  Certainly my lord  said he  if they be guilty of these crimes they deserve the severest punishment And do you reply to me  exclaimed the Protector  with your  ifs  and your  ands  You are the chief abettor of that witch Shore You are yourself a traitor And I swear by St Paul that I will not dine before your head be brought me  He struck the table with his hand Armed men rushed in at the signal The counsellors were thrown into the utmost consternation And one of the guards as if by accident or mistake aimed a blow at lord Stanley with a pollax who aware of the danger slunk below the table and tho' he saved his life he received a severe wound on the head in the protector's presence  Execution of lord Hastings  Hastings was seized was hurried away and instantly beheaded on a timberlog which lay in the court of the Tower  Hist Croyl cont p  Two hours after a proclamation wellpenned and fairly wrote was read to the citizens of London enumerating Hasting's offences and apologizing to them from the suddenness of the discovery for the sudden execution of that nobleman who was very popular among them But the saying of a merchant was much talked of on that occasion who remarked that the proclamation was certainly drawn by the spirit of prophecy  Sir Thomas More p    LORD Stanley the archbishop of York the bishop of Ely and other counsellors were committed prisoners to different chambers of the Tower And the protector in order to carry on the farce of his accusations ordered the goods of Jane Shore to be seized and he summoned her to answer before the council for sorcery and inchantment But as no proofs which could be received even in that ignorant age were produced against her he ordered her to be tried in the spiritual court for her adulteries and lewdness and she did penance in a white sheet at St Paul's before the whole people This lady was born of reputable parents in London was well educated and married to a substantial citizen but unhappily views of interest more than the maid's inclinations had been consulted in this match and her mind tho' framed for virtue had proved unable to resist the  allurements of Edward who sollicited her favours But while seduced from her duty by this gay and amorous monarch she still made herself respectable by her other virtues and the ascendant which her charms and vivacity long maintained over him was all employed in acts of beneficence and humanity She was still forward to oppose calumny to protect the oppressed to relieve the indigent and her good offices the genuine result of her heart never waited the solicitation of pretents or the hopes of reciprocal favours But she lived not only to feel the butterness of shame imposed on her by this barbarous tyrant but to experience in old age and poverty the ingratitude of those courtiers who had long solicited her friendship and been protected by her credit No one among the great multitudes whom she had obliged appeared to bring her consolation or relief She languished out her life in solitude and indigence And amidst a court enured to the most atrocious crimes the frailties of this woman justified all violations of friendship towards her and all oblivion of former favours  The protector a  at the crown  THOSE acts of violence exercised against all the nearest connexions of the late King prognosticated the severest fate to his defenceless children and after the murder of Hastings the Protector made no longer a secret of his intentions to usurp the crown The licentious life of Edward who was not restrained in his pleasures by any principle either of honour or prudence afforded a pretence for declaring his marriage with the Queen invalid and all his posterity illegitimate It was asserted that before his espousals with the lady Elizabeth Gray he had paid court to the lady Eleanor Talbot daughter of the earl of Shrewsbury and being repulsed by the virtue of that lady he was obliged ere he could gratify his desires to consent to a private marriage without any witnesses by Stillington bishop of Bath who afterwards revealed the secret  H  st Croyl cont p Comines Sir Thomas More p  It was also maintained that the act of attainder passed against the duke of Clarence had virtually incapacitated his children from succeeding to the crown and these two families being set aside the Protector of course remained the only true and legitimate heir of the house of York But as it would be difficult if not impossible to prove the preceding marriage of the late King and as the principle which excluded the heirs of an attainted blood from private successions was never extended to the crown the Protector resolved to make use of another plea still more shameful and scandalous His partizans were taught to maintain that both Edward IV and the duke of Clarence were illegitimate that the dutchess of York had received different lovers into her bed who were the fathers of these children that their resemblance to those gallants was a sufficient proof of their spurious birth and that the duke of Glocester alone of all her sons appeared  by his features and countenance to be the lawful offspring of the duke of York Nothing can be imagined more impudent than this assertion which threw so foul an imputation on his own mother a princess of irreproachable virtue and then alive yet the place chosen for first promulgating it was the pulpit before the whole people and in the Protector's presence Dr Shaw was appointed to preach in St Paul's  d June  and having chosen this passage for his text  Bastard slips shall not thrive  he enlarged on all the topics which could discredit the birth of Edward IV the duke of Clarence and of all their children He then broke out in a panygeric on the duke of Glocester and exclaimed  "Behold this excellent prince the express image of his noble father the genuine descendant of the house of York bearing no less in the virtues of his mind than in the features of his countenance the character of the gallant Richard once your hero and favourite He alone is entitled to your allegiance He must deliver you from the dominion of all intruders He alone can restore the lost glory and honour of the nation"  It was previously contrived that as the doctor should pronounce these words the duke of Glocester should enter the church and it was expected that the audience should cry out  God save King Richard  which would immediately have been laid hold of as a popular consent and interpreted to be the voice of the nation But by a ridiculous mistake worthy of the whole scene the duke did not appear till after this exclamation was already recited by the preacher The doctor was therefore obliged to repeat his rhetorical figure out of its proper place The audience less from the absurd conduct of the discourse than from their detestation of these proceedings kept a profound silence and the Protector and his preacher were equally abashed at the ill success of their stratagem  BUT the duke was too far advanced to recede from his criminal and ambitious projects A new expedient was tried to work on the people The mayor who was brother to doctor Shaw and entirely in the Protector's interests called an assembly of the citizens where the duke of Buckingham a man who possessed some talents for eloquence harangued them on the Protector's title to the throne and displayed those numerous virtues of which he pretended that prince was possessed He then asked them whether they would not have the duke for King and then stopt in expectation of hearing the cry  God save King Richard  He was surprized to observe them silent and turning about to the mayor he asked him the reason The mayor replied that perhaps they did not understand him Buckingham then repeated his discourse with some variation inforced the same topics asked the same question and was received with the same silence  "I now see the cause"  said the mayor  "the citizens are not accustomed to be harangued by any but  their recorder and know not how to answer a person of your grace's quality"  The recorder FitzWilliams was then commanded to repeat the substance of the duke's speech but the man who was very averse to the office took care throughout his whole discourse to have it understood that he spoke nothing of himself and that he only conveyed to them the sense of the duke of Buckingham Still the audience kept a profound silence  "This is wonderful obstinacy"  cried the duke  "Express your meaning my friends one way or other When we app y to you on this occasion it is merely from the regard which we bear to you The lords and commons have sufficient authority without your consent to appoint a King But I require you here to declare in plain terms whether or not you will have the duke of Glocester for your sovereign"  After all these efforts some of the meanest apprentices incited by the Protector's and Buckingham's servants raised a feeble cry  God save King Richard  Sir Thomas More p  The sentiments of the nation were now sufficiently declared The voice of the people was the voice of God  th June  And Buckingham with the mayor hastened to Baynard's castle where the Protector then resided that they might engage him to assume the government  WHEN Richard was told that a great multitude was in the court he refused to appear to them and pretended to be apprehensive for his personal safety A circumstance much taken notice of by Buckingham who observed to the citizens that the prince was ignorant of the whole design At last he was persuaded to come forth but he still kept at some distance and he asked the meaning of their intrusion and importunity Buckingham told him that the nation were resolved to have him for King The Protector declared his purpose to maintain his loyalty to the present sovereign and exhorted them to adhere to the same resolution He was told that the nation were determined to have another prince and if he rejected their unanimous voice they must look out for one who would be more compliant    This argument was too powerful to be resisted He was prevailed on to accept of the crown And he thenceforth acted as legitimate and rightful sovereign  THIS ridiculous farce was soon after followed by a scene truly tragical The murder of the two infant princes  Murder of Edward V and  f the duke of York  Richard sent orders to sir Robert Brakenbury constable of the Tower to put his nephews to death but this gentleman who had sentiments of honour refused to have any hand in the infamous office The tyrant then sent sir James Tyrrel who promised obedience and he ordered Brakenbury to resign to this gentleman the keys of the Tower for one night Tyrrel choosing three associates Slater Dighton and Forrest came in the nighttime  to the door of the chamber where the princes were lodged and sending in the assassins he bid them execute their commission while he himself staid without They found the young princes in bed and fallen into a sound sleep After sussocating them with the bolster and pillows they showed their naked bodies to Tyrrel who ordered them to be buried at the stair foot deep in the ground under a heap of stones  Sir T More p  These circumstances were all confessed by the actors in the following reign and they were never punished for the crime Probably because Henry whose maxims of government were extremely arbitrary desired to establish it as a principle that the commands of the reigning sovereign ought to justify every enormity in those who paid obedience to them But there is one circumstance not so easy to be accounted for It is pretended that Richard displeased with this indecent manner of burying his nephews whom he had murdered gave his chaplain orders to dig up the bodies and to interr them in consecrated ground and as the man died soon after the place of their burial remained unknown and the bodies could never be found by any search which Henry VII could make for them Yet in the reign of Charles II when there was occasion to remove some stones and to dig into the very spot which was mentioned as the place of their first interment the bones of two persons were there found which by their size corresponded exactly to the age of Edward and his brother They were concluded with certainty to be the remains of those princes and were interred under a marble monument by orders of King Charles  Kennet p  Perhaps Richard's chaplain had died before he found an opportunity of executing his master's commands and the bodies being supposed to be already removed a diligent search was not made for them by Henry in the place where they had been interred  RICHARD III  THE first acts of Richard's administration were to bestow rewards on those who had assisted him in usurping the crown and to gain by favours those who he thought were best able to support his future government Thomas lord Howard was created duke of Norfolk Sir Thomas Howard his son earl of S  lord Lovel a viscount by the same name even lord Stanley was set at liberty and made lord Steward of the household This nobleman had become obnoxious by his first opposition to Richard's views and also by his marrying the counters dowager of Richmond the heiress of the Somerset family but sensible of the necessity of submission to the present government he counterfeited such zeal for Richard's cause that he was received into favour and even found means to be entrusted with the most important commands by that politic and jealous tyrant  BUT the person who both from the greatness of his services and the power and splendor of his family was best intitled to favours under the new government was the duke of Buckingham and Richard seemed determined to spare no pains nor bounty in securing him to his interests Buckingham was descended from a daughter of Thomas of Woodstock duke of Glocester uncle to Richard II and by this pedigree he was both allied to the royal family and had claims for dignities as well as estates of a very extensive nature The duke of Glocester and Henry earl of Derby afterwards Henry IV had married the two daughters and coheirs of Bohun earl of Hereford one of the greatest of the antient barons whose immense property came thus to be divided into two shares The one was inherited by the family of Buckingham the other was united to the crown by the family of Lancaster and after the forfeiture of that royal line was seized as legally devolved to them by the sovereigns of the house of York The duke of Buckingham laid hold of the present opportunity and claimed the rest  tution of that portion of the Hereford estate which had escheated to the crown as well as of the great office of constable which had long continued by inheritance in his ancestots of that family Richard readily complied with these demands which were probably the price stipulated to Buckingham for his assistance in promoting the usurpation That nobleman was installed in the office of constable he received a grant of the esurpation of Hereford  Dugdale Baron vol p  many other dignities  and honours were conferred upon him and the King thought himself secure of preserving the fidelity of a man whose interests seemed to be so closely connected with those of the present government  Duke of Buckingham discontented  BUT it was impossible that friendship could long remain inviolate between two men of such corrupt morals as Richard and the duke of Buckingham Historians ascribe their first quarrel to the King's refusal of making restitution of the Hereford estate but it is certain from records that he passed a grant for that purpose and that the full demands of Buckingham were satisfied in this particular Perhaps Richard was soon sensible of the danger which might ensue from conferring such an immense property on a man of so turbulent a character and afterwards raised difficulties about the execution of his own grant Perhaps he refused some other demands of Buckingham whom he found it impossible to satisfy for his past services Perhaps he resolved according to the usual maxim of politicians to seize the first opportunity of ruining this powerful subject who had been the principal instrument of his own elevation and the discovery of this intention begot the first suspicions in the duke of Buckingham However this may be it is certain that the duke soon after Richard's accession began to form a conspiracy against the government and attempted to overthrow that usurpation which he himself had so zealously contributed to establish  NEVER was there an usurpation in any country more flagrant than that of Richard nor more repugnant to every principle of justice and public interest His claim was entirely founded on impudent allegations never attempted to be proved some of them incapable of proof and all of them implying scanda  ous reflections on his own family and on the persons with whom he was the most nearly connected His title was never acknowledged by any rational assembly scarce even by the lowest populace to whom he appealed and had become prevalent merely for want of some person of distinction who might stand forth against him and give a voice to those sentiments of general detestation which arose in every bosom Were men disposed to pardon these violations of public right the sense of private and domestic duty which is not to be effaced in the most barbarous times must have begot an abhorrence against him and have represented the murder of the young and innocent princes his nephews with whose protection he had been entrusted in the most odious colours imaginable To endure such a bloody usurper seemed to draw disgrace upon the nation and to be attended with immediate danger to every individual who was distinguished by his birth merit or services Such was become the general v ice of the people all parties were united in the same sentiments and the Lancastrians so long oppressed and of late so much discredited felt their blasted hopes again revive and  anxiously attended to the consequences of these extraordinary events The duke of Buckingham whose family had been devoted to that interest and who by his mother a daughter of Edmund duke of Somerset was allied to the house of Lancaster was easily inclined to espouse the cause of this party and to endeavour the restoring it to its antient superiority Morton bishop of Ely a zealous Lancastrian whom the King had imprisoned and had afterwards committed to the custody of Buckingham encouraged these sentiments and by his exhortations the duke cast his eye on the young earl of Richmond as the only person who could free the nation from the tyranny of the present usurper  Hist Croyl cont p    HENRY earl of Richmond was at this time detained in a kind of honourable custody by the duke of Brittany and his descent which seemed to give him some pretensions to the crown had been a great object of jealousy both in the late and in the present reign John the first duke of Somerset who was grandson of John of Gaunt by a spurious branch but legitimated by act of parliament had left only one daughter Margaret and his younger brother Edmund had succeeded him in his titles and in a considerable part of his fortune Margaret had espoused Edmund earl of Richmond half brother of Henry VI and son of Sir Owen Tudor and Catherine of France relict of Henry V and she bore him only one son who received the name of Henry and who after his father's death inherited the honours and fortune of Richmond His mother being a widow had espoused in second marriage Sir Henry Stafford uncle to Buckingham and after the death of that gentleman had married the present lord Stanley but had no children by either of these husbands and her son Henry was thus in the event of her death the only lawful heir of all her fortunes But this was not the most considerable advantage which he had reason to expect from her succession He would represent the eldest branch of the house of Somerset he would inherit all the title of that family to the crown and tho' its claim while any legitimate branch subsisted of the house of Lancaster had always been much disregarded the zeal of faction after the death of Henry VI and the murder of prince Edward immediately conferred a weight and consideration upon it  KING Edward IV finding that all the Lancastrians had cast their eyes towards the young earl of Richmond as the object of their hopes thought him also worthy of his attention and pursued him into his retreat in Brittany whither his uncle the earl of Pembroke had carried him after the battle of Teukesbury so fatal to his party He applied to Francis II duke of Brittany who was his ally a weak but a good prince and desired him to deliver up this sugitive  who might be the source of future disturbances in England But the duke averse to so dishonourable a proposal would only consent that for the security of Edward the young nobleman should be detained in custody and he received an annual pension from England for the safe keeping or subsistance of his prisoner But towards the end of Edward's reign when the kingdom was menaced with a war both from France and Scotland the anxieties of the English court with regard to Henry were very much encreased and Edward made a new proposal to the duke which covered under the fairest appearances the most bloody and treacherous intentions He pretended that he was desirous of gaining his enemy and of uniting him to his own family by a marriage with his daughter Elizabeth and he sollicited to have him sent over to England for the executing a scheme which would redound so much to his advantage These pretences seconded by bribes to Peter Landais a corrupt minister by whom the duke was entirely governed gained credit with the court of Brittany Henry was delivered into the hands of the English agents He was ready to embark When a suspicion of Edward's real design was suggested to the duke who recalled his orders and thus saved the unhappy youth from the imminent danger which hang over him  THESE symptoms of continued jealousy in the reigning family of England both seemed to give some authority to Henry's pretensions and made him the object of general favour and compassion on account of the dangers and persecutions to which he was exposed The universal detestation of Richard's conduct turned still more the attention of the nation towards him and as all the descendants of the house of York were either women or minors he seemed to be the only person from whom the nation could expect the expulsion of the odious and bloody tyrant But notwithstanding these circumstances which were so favourable to Henry Buckingham and the bishop of Ely well knew that there would still lie many obstructions in his way to the throne and that tho' the nation had been extremely divided between Henry VI and the duke of York when present possession and hereditary right stood in opposition to each other yet so soon as these titles were conjoined by Edward IV the bulk of the people had come over to the reigning family and the Lancastrians had extremely decayed both in numbers and authority It was therefore suggested by Morton and readily assented to by the duke that the only means of overturning the present usurpation was to unite the opposite factions by contracting a marriage between the earl of Richmond and the princess Elizabeth eldest daughter of King Edward and thereby blending together the opposite pretensions of their families which had so long been the source of public disorders and convulsions They were sensible  that the people were extremely desirous of repose after so many bloody and destructive commotions that both Yorkists and Lancastrians who now lay equally under oppression would embrace this scheme with ardour and that the prospect of reconciling the two parties which was in itself so desirable an end would when added to the general hatred of the present government render their cause absolutely invincible In consequence of these views the prelate by means of Reginald Bray steward to the countess of Richmond opened the first proposals of both an union to that lady and the scheme appeared so advantageous for her son and at the same time so likely to succeed that it admitted not of the least hesitation Dr Lewis a Weish physician who had access to the Queendowager in her sanctuary carried the proposals to her and found that revenge for the murder of her brother and of her three sons apprehensions for her remaining family resentment of her confinement and oppressions easily overcame all her prejudices against the house of Lancaster and procured her approbation of a marriage to which the age and birth as well as the present situation of the two parties seemed so naturally to invite them She secretly borrowed a sum of money in the city sent it over to the earl of Richmond required his oath to fulfil the marriage as soon as he should arrive in England advised him to levy as many foreign forces as possible and promised to join him on his first appearance with all the friends and partizans of her family  THE plan being thus laid upon the solid foundations of good sense and sound policy it was secretly communicated to the principal persons of both parties in all the counties of England and a wonderful alacrity appeared in every order of men to forward its success and completion But it was impossible that so extensive a conspiracy could be conducted so secretly as entirely to escape the jealous and vigilant eye of Richard and he soon received intelligence that his enemies headed by the duke of Buckingham were forming some design against his authority He immediately put himself in a posture of defence by levying some troops in the North and he summoned the duke to appear at court in such terms as seemed to promise him a renewal of their former friendship  October  But that nobleman well acquainted with the barbarity and treachery of Richard replied only by taking arms in Wales and giving the signal to his accomplices for a general insurrection in all parts of England But there happened at that very time to fall such heavy rains so incessant and continued as exceeded any known in the memory of man and the Severne with the other rivers in that neighbourhood swelled to a height which rendered them impassable and prevented Buckingham from marching into the heart of England to join his associates The Welshmen partly moved by superstition at this extraordinary event partly distressed by famine  in their camp fell off from him and Buckingham finding himself deserted by his followers put on a disguise and took shelter in the house of Banister an old servant of his family But being detected in his retreat he was brought to the King at Salisbury  Buckingham executed  and was instantly tried condemned and executed according to the summary method practised in those ages  Hist Croyl cont p  The other conspirators who took arms in four different places at Exeter at Salisbury at Newbury at Maidstone hearing of the duke of Buckingham's misfortunes despaired of success and immediately dispersed themselves  THE marquiss of Dorset and bishop of Ely made their escape beyond sea Many others were equally fortunate Several fell into Richard's hands of whom he made some examples His executions seem not to have been remarkably severe tho' we are told of one gentleman William Colingbourne who suffered under colour of this rebellion but in reality for a distich of quibbling verses which he had composed against Richard and his ministers  The lines were  The Pat the Cat and Lovel that D  g  Rule all England under the Hog  Alluding to the names of Ratcliffe and Catesby and to Richard's arms which were a boar  The earl of Richmond in concert with his friends had set sail from St Malo's carrying on board a body of men levied in foreign parts but his fleet being at first drove back by a storm he appeared not on the coast of England till after the dispersion of all his friends and he found himself obliged to return to the court of Brittany  d of Jan  THE King thus triumphant in all places and strengthened by this unsuccessful attempt to dethrone him ventured at last to summon a parliament a measure which his crimes and flagrant usurpation had made him hitherto decline Tho' it was natural that the parliament in a contest of national parties should always adhere to the victor he seems to have apprehended lest his title founded on no principle and supported by no party might be rejected by that assembly But his enemies being now at his feet the parliament had no choice but to recognize his authority and acknowledge his right to the crown His only son Edward then a youth of twelve years of age was created prince of Wales The duties of tonnage and poundage were granted him for life And Richard in order to reconcile the nation to his government passed some popular laws particularly one against the late practice of extorting money on pretence of benevolences  ALL the other measures of the King tended to the same object Sensible that the only circumstance which could give him security was to gain the confidence of the Yorkists he paid court to the Queendowager with such art and address made such earnest protestations of his sincere goodwill and friendship that this princess tired of confinement and despairing of any success from her former projects ventured to leave her sanctuary and to put herself and her daughters into the hands of the tyrant But he soon carried farther his views for the establishment of his throne He had married Anne the second daughter of the earl of Warwic and widow of Edward prince of Wales whom Richard himself had murdered but this princess having born him but one son who died about this time he considered her as an invincible obstacle to the settlement of his fortune and he was believed to have carried her off by poison a crime for which the public could not be supposed to have any very solid proof but which the usual tenor of his conduct made it reasonable to suspect He now thought it in his power to remove the chief perils which threatened his government The earl of Richmond he knew could never be dangerous but from his projected marriage with the princess Elizabeth the true heir of the crown and he therefore intended by means of a papal dispensation to espouse himself this princess and thus to unite in his own family their contending titles The Queendowager eager to recover her lost authority neither scrupled this alliance which was very unusual in England and was regarded as incestuous nor felt any horror at marrying her daughter to the murderer of her three sons and of her brother She even conjoined so far her interests with those of the usurper that she wrote to all her partizans and among the rest to her son the marquiss of Dorset desiring them to withdraw from the earl of Richmond an injury which the earl could never afterwards forgive The court of Rome was applied to for a dispensation Richard thought that he could easily defend himself during the interval till it arrived and he had afterwards the agreeable prospect of a full and secure settlement He flattered himself that the English nation seeing all danger removed of a disputed succession would then acquiesce under the dominion of a prince who was of mature years of great abilities and of a genius qualified for government and that they would forgive him all the crimes which he had committed in paving his way to the throne  BUT the crimes of Richard were so horrid and so shocking to humanity that the natural sentiments of men without any political or public views were sufficient to render his government unstable and every person of probity and honour was earnest to prevent the sceptre from being farther polluted by that bloody and treacherous hand which held it All the exiles flocked to the earl of Richmond  in Brittany and exhorted him to hasten his attempt of a new invasion and to prevent the marriage of the princess Elizabeth which must prove so fatal to all his hopes The earl sensible of the urgent necessity but dreading the treachery of Peter Landais who had entered into a negotiation with Richard for delivering him up was obliged to attend only to his present safety and he made his escape to the court of France The ministers of Charles VIII who had now succeeded to the throne after the death of his father Lewis gave him countenance and protection and being desirous of raising disturbances to Richard they secretly encouraged the earl in the levies which he made for the support of his enterprize against England The earl of Oxford whom Richard's suspicions had thrown into confinement having made his escape here joined Henry and enflamed his ardour for the attempt by the favourable accounts which he brought of the dispositions of the English nation and their universal hatred of Richard's crimes and usurpation  Invasion by the earl of Richmond th of Aug  THE earl of Richmond set out from Harsleur in Normandy with a retinue of about persons and after a navigation of six days he arrived at MilfordHaven in Wales where he landed without opposition He directed his course to that part of the kingdom in hopes that the Welsh who regarded him as their countryman and who had been already prepossessed in savour of his cause by means of the duke of Buckingham would join his standard and enable him to make head against the established government Richard who knew not in what quarter he might expect the invader had taken post at Nottingham in the centre of the kingdom and having given commissions to different persons in the several counties whom he empowered to oppose his enemy he proposed in person to fly on the first alarm to the place which was exposed to danger Sir Rice ap Thomas and Sir Walter Herbert were entrusted with this authority in Wales but the former immediately deserted to Henry the second made but seeble opposition to him And the earl advancing towards Shrewsbury received every day some reinforcement from his partizans Sir Gilbert Talbot joined him with all the vassals and retainers of the family of Shrewsbury Sir Thomas Bourchier Sir Walter Hungerford brought their friends to share his fortune and the appearance of men of distinction in his camp made already the cause wear a favourable aspect  BUT the danger to which Richard was chiefly exposed proceeded not so much from the zeal of his open enemies as from the infidelity of his pretended friends Scarce any nobleman of distinction was sincerely attached to his cause except the duke of Norfolk and all those who feigned the most loyalty were only watching  an opportunity to betray and desert him But the persons of whom he entertained the greatest suspicion were the lord Stanley and his brother Sir William whose connexions with the earl of Richmond notwithstanding their professions of attachment to his person were never entirely forgot or overlooked by him When he empowered lord Stanley to levy forces he still retained his eldest son lord Strange as a pledge of his fidelity and that nobleman was on this account obliged to employ great precaution and reserve in his proceedings He raised a powerful body of his friends and retainers in Cheshire and Lancashire but without openly declaring himself And tho' Henry had received secret assurances of his friendly intention the armies on both sides knew not what to infer from his equivocal behaviour  of A  g Battle of Bosworth  The two rivals at last approached each other at Bosworth near Leicester Henry at the head of six thousand men Richard with an army of above double the number and a decisive action was every hour looked for between them Stanley who commanded about seven thousand men took care to post himself at Atherstone not far from the expected field of battle and he made such a disposition as enabled him on occasion to join either party Richard had too much sagacity not to discover his intentions from these movements but he kept the secret from his own men for fear of discouraging them He took not immediate revenge on Stanley's son as some of his courtiers advised him because he hoped that so valuable a pledge would induce the father to prolong still farther his ambiguous conduct And he hastened to decide by arms the quarrel with his competitor being certain that a victory over the earl of Richmond would enable him to take ample revenge of all his enemies open and concealed  THE van of Richmond's army consisting of archers was commanded by John earl of Oxford Sir Gilbert Talbot led the right wing Sir John Savage the left The earl himself accompanied by his uncle the earl of Pembroke placed himself in the main body Richard also took post in  his  main body and entrusted the command of his van to the duke of Norfolk As his wings were never engaged we have not learned the names of the several commanders Soon after the battle began lord Stanley whose conduct in this whole affair discovers great precaution and abilities appeared in the field and declared for the earl of Richmond This measure which was so unexpected to the men tho' not to their leaders had a proportional effect on both armies It inspired unusual courage into Henry's soldiers it threw Richard's into dismay and confusion The intrep  d tryant sensible of his desperate situation cast his eye around the field and perceiving his rival at no great distance he drove against him with fury in  that e  er Henry's death or his own would soon decide the victory between  them He killed with his own hands Sir William Brandon standardbearer to the earl He dismounted Sir John Cheyney He was now within reach of Richmond himself who declined not the combat  Death  when Sir William Stanley breaking in with his troops surrounded Richard who fighting bravely to the last moment was overwhelmed by the numbers of his enemies and perished by a fate too mild and honourable for his multiplied and detestable enormities His men every where sought for safety by flight  THERE fell in this battle about men on the side of the vanquished and among these the duke of Norfolk the lord Ferrars of Chartley Sir Richard Ratcliffe Sir Robert Piercy and Sir Robert Brakenbury The loss was very inconsiderable on the side of the victors Sir William Catesby a great instrument of Richard's crimes was taken and soon after beheaded with some others at Leicester The body of Richard was found in the field covered with dead enemies and all besmeared with blood It was thrown carelessly across a horse was carried to Leicester amid the shouts of the insulting spectators and was interred in the GrayFriars church of that place  and character of Richard III  THE historians who favour Richard for even he has met with partizans among the later writers maintain that he was well qualified for government had he legally obtained it and that he committed no crimes but such as were necessary to procure him possession of the crown But this is a very poor apology when it is confessed that he was ready to commit the most horrid crimes which appeared necessary for that purpose and it is certain that all his courage and capacity qualities in which he really seems not to have been desicient would never have made compensation to the people for the danger of the precedent and for the contagious example of vice and murder exalted upon the throne This prince was of a small stature humpbacked and had a very harsh disagreeable visage so that his body was in every particular no less deformed than his mind  THUS have we pursued the History of England thro' a series of many barbarous ages till we have at last reached the dawnings of civility and science and have the prospect both of greater certainty in our historical narrations and of being able to present to the reader a spectacle more worthy of his attention The want of certainty however and of circumstances is not alike to be complained of throughout every period of this long narration This island possesses many antient historians of good credit as well as many historical monuments and it is  rare that the annals of so uncultivated a people as were the English as well as the other European nations after the decline of Roman learning have been transmitted to posterity so compleat and with so little mixture of falsehood and of fable This advantage we owe entirely to the clergy of the church of Rome who founding their authority on their superior knowledge preserved the precious literature of antiquity from a total extinction  Every one that has perused the antient Monkish wri  ers knows that however barbarous their own style they  of allusions to the Latin classics especially the poets There seems also in  middle ages to have remained many antient books that are now lost Malmesbury who flour  shed in the re  gn of Henry I and K Stephen qu  tes Livy's description of Caesar's passage over the Rubicon FitzStephen who lived in the reign of Henry II alludes to a passage in the larger history of Sallust In the colle  on of letters which passes under the name of Thomas a Becket we see how similar all the antient history and antient books were to the more ingenious and more dignified churchmen of that time and consequently how much that order of men must have surpassed all the other members of the society That prelate and his friends call each other philosophers in all the course of their correspondence and consider with reason the rest of the world as sank into total ignorance and barbarism By the present diffusion of learning even those who are illiterate receive so  improvement to be more on a level with men of knowledge and learning  and under shelter of their numerous privileges and immunities acquired a security by means of the superstition which they would in vain have claimed from the justice and humanity of those turbulent and licentious ages Nor is the spectacle altogether unentertaining and uninstructive which the history of those times presents to us The view of human manners and actions in all their variety of appearances is both profitable and agreeable and if the aspect in some periods seems horrid and deformed we may thence learn to cherish with the greater anxiety that science and civility which has so close a connexion with virtue and humanity and which as it is a sovereign antidote against superstition is also the most effectual remedy against vice and disorders of every kind  THE rise progress perfection and decline of art and science are curious objects of contemplation and intimately confected with a narration of civil transactions The events of no particular period can be fully accounted for but by considering the degrees of advancement which men have reached in those particulars  THOSE who cast their eye on the general revolutions of society will find that as all the improvements of the human mind had reached nearly to their state of perfection about the age of Augustus there was a sensible decline from that point or period and men thenceforth relapsed gradually into ignorance and barbarism The unlimited extent of the Roman empire and the consequent despotism of the monarchs extinguished all emulation debased the generous spirits of men  and depressed that noble flame by which all the refined arts must be cherished and enlivened The military government which soon succeeded rendered even the lives and properties of men insecure and precarious and proved destructive to those vulgar and more necessary arts of agriculture manufactures and commerce and in the end to the military art and genius itself by which alone the immense fabric of the empire could be supported The irruption of the barbarous nations which soon followed overwhelmed all human knowledge which was already far in its decline and men sunk every age deeper into ignorance stupidity and superstition till the light of antient science and history had very nearly suffered a total extinction in all the European nations  BUT there is an ultimate point of depression as well as of exaltation from which human affairs naturally return in a contrary progress and beyond which they seldom pass either in their advancement or decline The period in which the people of Christendom were the lowest sunk in ignorance and consequently in disorders of every kind may justly be fixed at the eleventh century about the age of William the Conqueror and from that Aera the sun of science beginning to reascend threw out many gleams of light which preceded the full morning when letters were revived in the fifteenth century The Danes and other northern people who had so long infested all the coasts and even the inland parts of Europe by their depredations having now learned the arts of tillage and agriculture found a settled subsistance at home and were no longer tempted to desert their industry in order to seek a precarious livelihood by rapine and by the plunder of their neighbours The feudal governments also among the more southern nations were reduced to a kind of system and tho' that strange species of civil polity was ill fitted to ensure either liberty or tranquility it was preferable to the universal licence and disorder which had every where preceded it But perhaps there was no event which tended farther to the improvement of the age than one which has not been much remarked the accidental finding a copy of Justinian's Pandects about the year in the town of Amalsi in Italy  THE ecclesiastics who had leizure and some inclination to study immediately adopted with zeal this excellent system of jurifprudence and spread the knowledge of it in every part of Europe Besides the intrinsic merit of the performance it was recommended to them by its original connexion with the imperial city of Rome which being the seat of their religion seemed to acquire a new lustre and authority by the diffusion of its laws over the western world In less than ten years after the discovery of the Pandects Vacarius under the protection of Theobald archbishop of Canterbury read public lectures of civil law in the university of Oxford and the clergy every where by their example as well as exhortation  were the means of spreading the highest esteem for this new science That order of men having large possessions to defend were in a manner necessitated to turn their studies towards the law and their properties being often endangered by the violence of the princes and barons it became their interest to enforce the observance of general and equitable rules from which alone they could receive protection As they possessed all the knowledge of the age and were alone acquainted with the habits of thinking the practice as well as science of the law fell mostly into their hands And tho' the close connexion which without any necessity they formed between the canon and civil law begot a jealousy in the laity of England and prevented the Roman jurisprudence from becoming the municipal law of the country as was the case in many states of Europe a great part of it was secretly transferred into the practice of the courts of justice and the imitation of their neighbours made the English gradually endeavour to raise their own law from its orig nal state of rudeness and imperfection  IT is easy to see what advantages Europe must have reaped by its inheriting at once from the antients so complete an art which was of itself so necessary for giving security to all other arts and which by refining and still more by bestowing solidity on the judgment served as a model to farther improvements The sensible utility of the Roman law both to public and private interest recommended the study of it at a time when the more exalted and speculative sciences carried no charms with them and thus the last branch of antient literature which remained uncorrupted was happily the first transmitted to the modern world For it is remarkable that in the decline of Roman learning when the philosophers were universally infected with superstition and sophistry and the poets and historians with barbarism the lawyers who in other countries are seldom models of science or politeness were yet able by the constant study and close imitation of their predecessors to maintain the fame good sense in their decisions and reasonings and the same purity in their language and expression  WHAT bestowed an additional merit on the civil law was the extreme ignorance and imperfection of that jurisprudence which preceded it among all the European nations especially among the Saxons or antient English What absurd ties prevailed at that time in the administration of justice may be conceived from the authentic monuments which remain of the antient Saxon laws where a pecuniary commutation was received for every crime where stated prices were fixed for men's lives and members where private revenges were authorized for all injuries where the use of the ordeal corfnet and afterwards of the duel was the received method of proof and where the judges were rustic freeholders asembled of a sudden and deciding a cause from one debate or altercation of the  parties Such a state of society was very little advanced beyond the rude state of nature Violence universally prevailed instead of general and equitable maxims The pretended liberty of the times was only an incapacity of submitting to government And men not protected by law in their lives and properties sought shelter by their personal servility and attachments under some powerful chiestain or by voluntary combinations  THE gradual progress of improvement raised the Europeans somewhat from this uncultivated state and affairs in this island particularly took very early a turn which was more favourable to justice and to liberty Civil employments and occupations soon became honourable among the English The situation of that people rendered not the perpetual attention to wars so necessary as among their neighbours and all regard was not confined to the military profession The gentry and even the nobility began to deem an acquaintance with the law a requisite part of education They were less diverted than afterwards from studies of this kind by other sciences and in the age of Henry VI we are told by Fortescue there were in the Inns of Court about two thousand students most of them men of honourable birth who gave application to this branch of civil knowledge A circumstance which proves that a considerable advance was already made in the science of government and which prognosticated still a greater  ONE chief advantage which resulted from the introduction and progress of the arts was the introduction and progress of freedom and this consequence affected men both in their  personal  and  civil  capacities  IF we consider the antient state of Europe we shall find that the far greater part of the society were every where bereaved of their  personal  liberty and lived entirely at the will of their masters Every one that was not noble was a slave The peasants were sold along with the land The few inhabitants of cities were not in a better condition Even the gentry themselves were subjected to a long train of subordination under the greater barons or chief vassals of the crown who tho' seemingly placed in a high state of splendor yet having but a slender protection from the law were exposed to every tempest of state and by the precarious condition in which they lived paid dearly for the power of oppressing and tyrannizing over their inferiors The first incident which broke in upon this violent system of government was the practice begun in France of erecting communities and corporations endowed with privileges and a separate municipal government which gave them protection against the tyranny of the barons and  which the prince himself deemed it prudent to respect  early symptoms of the jealousy entertained by the barons against the progress of  of their licentious power A law was enacted Henry IV cap prohi  any one who did not possess twenty shillings a year in land from binding his sons apprentices to any trade They found already that the cities began to drain the country of the labourers and husband  and did not fore  ee now much the encrease of commerce would increase the value of their estates See farther Cott  p  The Kings to encourage the boroughs granted them this privilege  who had  month in any corporation and had been of the gild should be  The relaxation of the feudal tenures and an execution somewhat stricter of the public law bestowed an independance on vassals which was unknown to their forefathers And even the peasants themselves tho' later than other orders of the state made their escape from those bonds of villenage or slavery in which they had formerly been retained  IT may appear strange that the progress of the arts which seems among the Greeks and Romans to have dai  y encreased the number of slaves should in later times have proved so general a source of liberty but this difference of the events proceeded from a great difference in the circumstances which attended those institutions The antient barons being obliged to maintain themselves continually in a military posture and little emulous of elegance or splendor employed not their villains as domestic servants much less as manufacturers but composed their retinue of free men whose military spirit rendered the chieftain formidable to his neighbours and who were ready to attend him in every warlike enterprize The villains were occupied entirely in the cultivation of their master's land and paid their rents either in corn and cattle and other produce of the farm or in servile offices which they performed about the baron's family and upon the farms which he retained in his own possession In proportion as agriculture improved and money encreased it was found that these services tho' extremely burthensome to the villain were of little advantage to the master and that the produce of a large estate could be much more conveniently disposed of by the peasant himself who raised it than by the landlord or his bailiff who were formerly accustomed to receive it A commutation was therefore made of rents for services and of money rents for those in kind and as men in a subsequent age discovered that farms were better cultivated where the farmer enjoyed a security of possession the practice of granting leases to the peasant began to prevail which entirely broke the bonds of servitude already much relaxed from the former practices Thus villenage went gradually into disuse throughout the more civilized parts of Europe The interest of the master as well as that of the slave concurred in this alteration The latest laws which we find in  England for the enforcing or regulating this species of servitude were enacted in the reign of Henry VII And tho' the antient statutes on this subject remain still unrepealed by parliament it appears that before the reign of Elizabeth the distinction of villain and freeman was totally tho' insensibly abolished and that no person remained in the state to whom the former laws could be applied  THUS  personal  freedom became almost general in Europe an advantage which paved the way for the encrease of  political  or  civil  liberty and which even where it was not attended with this salutary effect served to give the members of the community some of the most considerable advantages of it  THE constitution of the English government ever since the invasion of this island by the Saxons may boast of this preeminence that in no age the will of the monarch was ever entirely absolute and uncontrouled But in other respects the ballance of power has extremely shifted among the several orders of the state and this fabric has experienced the same mutability which has attended all human institutions  THE antient Saxons like the other German nations where each individual was enured to arms and where the independance of men was secured by a great equality of possessions seem to have admitted a considerable mixture of democracy into their form of government and to have been one of the freest nations of which there remains any account in the records of history After this tribe was settled in England especially after the dissolution of the Heptarchy the great extent of the kingdom produced a great inequality in property and the ballance seems to have inclined to the side of the Aristocracy The Norman conquest threw more authority into the hands of the sovereign which however admitted of great controul tho' derived less from the general forms of the constitution which were inaccurate and irregular than from the independant power enjoyed by each baron in his particular district or province The establishment of the great charter exalted still higher the Aristocracy imposed regular limits on royal power and gradually introduced some mixture of Democracy into the constitution But even during this period from the accession of Edward I to the death of Richard III the condition of the commons was nowise desirable a kind of Polish Aristocracy prevailed and tho' the Kings were limited the people were as yet far from being free It required the authority almost absolute of the sovereigns which took place in the subsequent period to pull down these disorderly and licentious tyrants who were equal enemies to peace and to freedom and to establish that regular execution of the laws which in a following age enabled the people to erect a regular and equitable plan of liberty  IN each of these successive alterations the only rule of government which is intelligible or carries any authority with it is the established practice of the age and the maxims of administration which are at that time prevalent and universally assented to Those who from a pretended respect to antiquity appeal at every turn to an original plan of the constitution only cover their turbulent spirit and their private ambition under the appearance of venerable forms and whatever period they pitch on for their model they may still be carried back to a more antient period where they will find the measures of power entirely different and where every circumstance by reason of the greater barbarity of the times will appear still less worthy of imitation Above all a civilized nation like the English who have happily established the most perfect and most accurate system of liberty that ever was found compatible with government ought to be cautions of appealing to the practice of their ancestors or regarding the maxims of uncultivated ages as certain rules for their present conduct An acquaint  nce with the history of the remote periods of their government is chiefly  useful  by instructing them to cherish their present constitution from a comparison or contrast with the condition of those distant times And it is also  curious  by showing them the remote and commonly faint and disfigured originals of the most finished and most noble institutions and by instructing them in the great mixture of accident which commonly concurs with a small ingredient of wisdom and foresight in erecting the complicated fabric of the most perfect government  The END of the SECOND VOLUME  ERRATA  P l read
