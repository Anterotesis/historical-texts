RoyalExchange J GARDINER in CharlesStreet Westminster and J ALMON in Piccadilly MDCCLXIII  THE CONFERENCE  GRACE said in form which Sceptics must agree  When they are told that Grace was said by Me  The Servants gone to break the scurvy jest  On the proud Landlord and his threadbare guest  The King gone round my Lady too withdrawn  My Lord in usual taste began to yawn  And lolling backward in his Elbowchair  With an insipid kind of stupid stare  Picking his teeth twirling his seals about  CHURCHILL You have a Poem coming out  You've my best wishes but I really fear  Your Muse in general is too severe  Her Spirit seems her int'rest to oppose  And where She makes one friend makes twenty foes  C  Your Lordship's fears are just I feel their force  But only feel it as thing of course  The Man whose hardy Spirit shall engage  To lash the vices of a guilty age  At his first setting forward ought to know  That ev'ry rogue he meets must be his foe  That the rude breath of Satire will provoke  Many who feel and more who fear the stroke  But shall the partial rage of selfish men  From stubborn Justice wrench the righteous pen  Or shall I not my settled course pursue  Because my foes are foes to Virtue too  L  What is this boasted Virtue taught in Schools  And idly drawn from antiquated rules  What is her Use point out one wholesome end  Will She hurt foes or can She make a Friend  When from long fasts fierce appetites arise  Can this same Virtue stifle Nature's cries  Can She the pittance of a meal afford  Or bid thee welcome to one great Man's board  When Northern winds the rough December arm  With frost and snow can Virtue keep thee warm  Canst Thou dismiss the hard unfeeling Dun  Barely by saying Thou art Virtue's Son  Or by base blund'ring Statesmen sent to jail  Will MANSFIELD take this Virtue for thy bail  Believe it not the Name is in disgrace  Virtue and TEMPLE now are out of place  Quit then this Meteor whose delusive ray  From wealth and honour leads thee far astray  True Virtue means let Reason use her eyes  Nothing with Fools and Int'rest with the Wise  Would'st Thou be great her patronage disclaim  Nor madly triumph in so mean a name  Let nobler wreaths thy happy brows adorn  And leave to Virtue poverty and scorn  Let Prudence be thy guide who doth not know  How seldom Prudence can with Virtue go  To be Successful try thy utmost force  And Virtue follows as a thing of course  HIRCO who knows not HIRCO stains the bed  Of that kind Master who first gave him bread  Scatters the seeds of discord thro' the land  Breaks ev'ry public ev'ry private band  Beholds with joy a trusting friend undone  Betrays a Brother and would cheat a Son  What mortal in his senses can endure  The name of HIRCO for the wretch is poor  "Let him hang drown starve on a dunghill rot  "By all detested live and die forgot  "Let him a poor return in ev'ry breath  "Feel all death's pains yet be whole years in death"  Is now the gen'ral cry we all pursue  Let FORTUNE change and PRUDENCE changes too  Supple and pliant a new system feels  Throws up her Cap and spaniels at his heels  Long live Great HIRCO cries by int'rest taught  And let his foes tho' I prove one be nought  C  Peace to such Men if such Men can have peace  Let their Possessions let their State increase  Let their base services in Courts strike root  And in the season bring forth golden fruit  I envy not let those who have the will  And with so little Spirit so much skill  With such vile instruments their fortunes carve  Rogues may grow fat an Honest man dares starve  L  These stale conceits thrown off let us advance  For once to real life and quit Romance  Starve pretty talking but I fain would view  That man that honest man would do it too  Hence to Yon Mountain which outbraves the sky  And dart from pole to pole thy strengthen'd eye  Thro' all that space You shall not view one man  Not one who dares to act on such a plan  Cowards in calms will say what in a storm  The Brave will tremble at and not perform  Thine be the Proof and spite of all You've said  You'd give Your Honour for a crust of bread  C  What Proof might do what Hunger might effect  What famish'd Nature looking with neglect  On all She once held dear what Fear at strife  With fainting Virtue for the means of life  Might make this coward flesh in love with breath  Shudd'ring at pain and shrinking back from death  In treason to my soul descend to bear  Trusting to Fate I neither know nor care  Once  at this hour those wounds afresh I feel  Which nor Prosperity nor Time can heal  Those wounds which Fate severely hath decreed  Mention'd or thought of must for ever bleed  Those wounds which humbled all that pride of Man  Which brings such mighty aid to Virtue's plan  Once  aw'd by Fortune's most oppressive frown  By legal rapine to the earth bow'd down  My Credit at last gasp my State undone  Trembling to meet the shock I could not shun  Virtue gave ground and blank despair prevail'd  Sinking beneath the storm my Spirits fail'd  Like PETER's Faith 'till One a Friend indeed  May all distress find such in time of need  One kind good Man in act in word in thought  By Virtue guided and by Wisdom taught  Image of him whom Christians should adore  Stretch'd forth his hand and brought me safe to shore  Since  by good fortune into notice rais'd  And for some little merit largely prais'd  Indulg'd in swerving from Prudential rules  Hated by Rogues and not belov'd by Fools  Plac'd above want shall abject thirst of wealth  So fiercely war 'gainst my Soul's dearest health  That as a boon I should base shackles crave  And born to Freedom make myself a slave  That I should in the train of those appear  Whom Honour cannot love nor Manhood fear  That I no longer skulk from street to street  Afraid least Duns assail and Bailiffs meet  That I from place to place this carcase bear  Walk forth at large and wander free as air  That I no longer dread the aukward friend  Whose very obligations must offend  Nor all too froward with impatience burn  At suff'ring favours which I can't return  That from dependance and from pride secure  I am not plac'd so high to scorn the poor  Nor yet so low that I my Lord should fear  Or hesitate to give him sneer for sneer  That whilst sage Prudence my pursuits confirms  I can enjoy the world on equal terms  That kind to others to myself most true  Feeling no want I comfort those who do  And with the will have pow'r to aid distress  These and what other blessings I possess  From the indulgence of the PUBLIC rise  All private Patronage my Soul defies  By Candour more inclin'd to save than damn  A gen'rous PUBLIC made me what I Am  All that I have They gave just Mem'ry bears  The grateful stamp and what I am is Theirs  L  To feign a redhot zeal for freedom's cause  To mouthe aloud for liberties and laws  For Public good to bellow all abroad  Serves well the purposes of private fraud  Prudence by Public good intends her own  If You mean otherwise You stand alone  What do we mean by Country and by Court  What is it to Oppose what to Support  Mere words of course and what is more absurd  Than to pay homage to an empty word  MAJORS and MINORS differ but in name  Patriots and Ministers are much the same  The only diff'rence after all their rout  Is that the One is  in  the Other  out    Explore the dark recesses of the mind  In the Soul's honest volume read mankind  And own in wise and simple great and small  The same grand leading Principle in All  Whate'er we talk of wisdom to the wise  Of goodness to the good of public ties  Which to our country link of private bands  Which claim most dear attention at our hands  For Parent and for Child for Wife and Friend  Our first great Mover and our last great End  Is One and by whatever name we call  The ruling Tyrant SELF is All in All  This which unwilling Faction shall admit  Guided in diff'rent ways a BUTE and PITT  Made Tyrants break made Kings observe the law  And gave the world a STUART and NASSAU  Hath Nature strange and wild conceit of Pride  Distinguish'd thee from all her sons beside  Doth Virtue in thy bosom brighter glow  Or from a Spring more pure doth Action flow  Is not thy Soul bound with those very chains  Which shackle us or is that SELF which reigns  O'er Kings and Beggars which in all we see  Most strong and sov'reign only weak in Thee  Fond man believe it not Experience tells  'Tis not thy Virtue but thy Pride rebels  Think and for once lay by thy lawless pen  Think and confess thyself like other men  Think but one hour and to thy Conscience led  By Reason's hand bow down and hang thy head  Think on thy private life recal thy Youth  View thyself now and own with strictest truth  That SELF hath drawn Thee from fair Virtue's way  Farther than Folly would have dar'd to stray  And that the talents lib'ral Nature gave  To make thee free have made thee more a slave  Quit then in prudence quit that idle train  Of toys which have so long abus'd thy brain  And captive led thy pow'rs with boundless will  Let SELF maintain her state and empire still  But let her with more worthy objects caught  Strain all the faculties and force of thought  To things of higher daring let her range  Thro' better pastures and learn how to change  Let her no longer to weak faction tied  Wisely revolt and join our stronger side  C  Ah what my Lord hath private life to do  With things of public Nature why to view  Would You thus cruelly those scenes unfold  Which without pain and horror to behold  Must speak me something more or less than man  Which Friends may pardon but I never can  Look back a Thought which borders on despair  Which human Nature must yet cannot bear  'Tis not the babbling of a busy world  Where Praise and Censure are at random hurl'd  Which can the meanest of my thoughts controul  Or shake one settled purpose of my Soul  Free and at large might their wild curses roam  If All if All alas were well at home  No'tis the tale which angry Conscience tells  When She with more than tragic horror swells  Each circumstance of guilt when stern but true  She brings bad actions forth into review  And like the dread handwriting on the wall  Bids late Remorse awake at Reason's call  Arm'd at all points bids Scorpion Vengeance pass  And to the mind holds up Reflexion's glass  The mind which starting heaves the heartfelt groan  And hates that form She knows to be her own  Enough of thislet private sorrows rest  As to the Public I dare stand the test  Dare proudly boast I feel no wish above  The good of ENGLAND and my Country's love  Stranger to Partyrage by Reason's voice  Unerring guide directed in my choice  Not all the tyrant pow'rs of earth combin'd  No nor of hell shall make me change my mind  What herd with men my honest soul disdains  Men who with servile zeal are forging chains  For Freedom's neck and lend a helping hand  To spread destruction o'er my native land  What shall I not e'en to my latest breath  In the full face of danger and of death  Exert that little strength which Nature gave  And boldy stem or perish in the wave  L  When I look backward for some fifty years  And see Protesting Patriots turn'd to Peers  Hear men most loose for decency declaim  And talk of Character without a name  See Infidels assert the cause of God  And meek Divines wield persecution's rod  See men transform'd to brutes and brutes to men  See WHITEHEAD take a place RALPH change his pen  I mock the zeal and deem the Men in sport  Who rail at Ministers and curse a Court  Thee haughty as Thou art and proud in rime  Shall some Preferment offer'd at a time  When Virtue sleeps some Sacrifice to Pride  Or some fair Victim move to change thy side  Thee shall these eyes behold to health restor'd  Using as Prudence bids bold Satire's sword  Galling thy present friends and praising those  Whom now thy frenzy holds thy greatest foes  C  May I can worse disgrace on manhood fall  Be born a WHITEHEAD and baptiz'd a PAUL  May I tho' to his service deeply tied  By sacred oaths and now by will allied  With false feign'd zeal an injur'd God defend  And use his name for some base private end  May I that thought bids double horrors roll  O'er my sick Spirits and unmans my soul  Ruin the Virtue which I held most dear  And still must hold may I thro' abject fear  Betray my Friend may to succeeding times  Engrav'd on plates of Adamant my crimes  Stand blazing forth whilst mark'd with envious blot  Each little act of Virtue is forgot  Of all those evils which to stamp men curs'd  Hell keeps in store for vengeance may the worst  Light on my head and in my day of woe  To make the cup of bitterness o'erflow  May I be scorn'd by ev'ry man of worth  Wander like Cain a vagabond on earth  Bearing about a Hell in my own mind  Or be to SCOTLAND for my life confin'd  If I am one amongst the many known  Whom SHELBURNE fled and CALCRAFT blush'd to own  L  Do you reflect what men you make your foes  C  I do and that's the reason I oppose  Friends I have made whom Envy must commend  But not one foe whom I would wish a friend  What if ten thousand BUTES and FOXES bawl  One WILKES hath made a large amends for all  'Tis not the Title whether handed down  From age to age or flowing from the crown  In copious streams on recent men who came  From stems unknown and sires without a name  'Tis not the STAR which our great EDWARD gave  To mark the virtuous and reward the brave  Blazing without whilst a base heart within  Is rotten to the core with filth and sin  'Tis not the tinsel grandeur taught to wait  At custom's call to mark a fool of State  From fools of lesser note that Soul can awe  Whose Pride is Reason whose Defence is Law  L  Suppose a Thing scarce possible in Art  Were it thy Cue to play a common Part  Suppose thy Writings so well fenc'd in Law  That N cannot find nor make a Flaw  Hast thou not heard that 'mongst our antient Tribes  By Party warpt or lull'd asleep by Bribes  Or trembling at the Ruffian Hand of Force  Law hath suspended stood or chang'd its Course  Art Thou assur'd that for Destruction ripe  Thou mayst not smart beneath the selfsame Gripe  What Sanction hast Thou frantic in thy Rimes  Thy Life thy Freedom to secure  C  The Times  'Tis not on Law a System great and good  By Wisdom penn'd and bought by noblest Blood  My Faith relies By wicked Men and vain  Law once abus'd may be abus'd again  No on our great Lawgiver I depend  Who knows and guides them to their proper End  Whose Royalty of Nature blazes out  So fierce 'twere Sin to entertain a doubt  Did Tyrant STUARTS now the Laws dispense  Blest be the hour and hand which sent them hence  For something or for nothing for a Word  Or Thought I might be doom'd to Death  unheard    Life we might all resign to lawless Pow'r  Nor think it worth the purchase of an hour  But Envy ne'er shall fix so foul a stain  On the fair annals of a BRUNSWICK's reign  If Slave to Party to Revenge or Pride  If by frail human Error drawn aside  I break the Law strict rigour let Her wear  'Tis Her's to punish and 'tis mine to bear  Nor by the voice of Justice doom'd to death  Would I ask mercy with my latest breath  But anxious only for my Country's good  In which my King's of course is understood  Form'd on a plan with some few Patriot friends  Whilst by just means I aim at noblest ends  My Spirits cannot sink tho' from the tomb  Stern JEFFRIES should be plac'd in MANSFIELD's room  Tho' he should bring his base designs to aid  Some  black Attorney  for his purpose made  And shove whilst Decency and Law retreat  The modest NORTON from his Maiden seat  Tho' Both in ill Confed'rates should agree  In damned league to torture Law and Me  Whilst GEORGE is King I cannot fear endure  Not to be guilty is to be secure  But when in aftertimes be far remov'd  That day our Monarch glorious and belov'd  Sleeps with his Fathers should imperious Fate  In vengeance with fresh STUARTS curse our state  Should They o'erleaping ev'ry fence of Law  Butcher the brave to keep tame fools in awe  Should They by brutal and oppressive force  Divert sweet Justice from her even course  Should They of ev'ry other means bereft  Make my righthand a witness 'gainst my left  Should They abroad by Inquisitions taught  Search out my Soul and damn me for a thought  Still would I keep my course still speak still write  Till Death had plung'd me in the shades of Night  Thou GOD of  Truth  Thou great allsearching Eye  To whom our Thoughts our Spirits open lie  Grant me thy strength and in that needful hour  Should it e'er come when Law submits to Pow'r  With firm resolves my steady bosom steel  Bravely to suffer tho' I deeply feel  Let Me as hitherto still draw my breath  In love with life but not in fear of death  And if Oppression brings me to the grave  And marks him dead She ne'er shall mark a slave  Let no unworthy marks of grief be heard  No wild laments not one unseemly word  Let sober triumphs wait upon my bier  I won't forgive that Friend who drops one tear  Whether He's ravish'd in life's early morn  Or in old age drops like an ear of corn  Full ripe He falls on Nature's noblest plan  Who lives to Reason and who dies a Man  FINIS
