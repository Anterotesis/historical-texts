 THE TRAGEDY OF  Sir  THOMAS OVERBURY  Price  s    d    THE TRAGEDY OF Sir  Thomas Overbury  As it is Acted at the THEATREROYAL in  DruryLane  BY HIS Majesty's Company of Comedians  Written by  RICHARD SAVAGE Son of the Late Earl  Rivers  Obsequium Amicos Veritas Odium parit  Terent  O faelix Hominum genus  Si vestros Animos Amor  Quo Coelum regitur regat  LONDON  Printed for SAMUEL CHAPMAN at the  Angel  in  Pallmall  MDCCXXIV  TO  HERBERT TRYST  Esq  OF THE City of  Hereford  SIR  _I Have been told 'tis a Custom to ask Permission for such kind of Addresses but there is something so  very mean in this Civility to ask your Pardon for neglecting it were to deserve your Indignation  If Merit ought to be prefer'd to what the World calls Greatness if a Sense of past Favours should be consider'd before future Views You Sir have the justest Title to this Dedication from me were the Play a Performance more worthy Your Acceptance  Had other Authors the Knowledge and Experience  of your Virtues that I have I should find many Rivals when I beg leave to subscribe myself  SIR  Your Devoted Humble Servant Richard Savage  ADVERTISEMENT  _THE Importunity of the Publisher being very pressing I omit the  Preface  which I intended wherein I propos'd by way of  Essay  a Discourse on  TRAGEDY  The Subject being too copious to treat of in this short Time I defer it either to publish it single or to join it with some other Work  But my Gratitude prompts me to declare the Obligations I have to my Best and Dearest Friend  Mr  Aaron Hill  for his many judicious Corrections in this Tragedy On that  worthy Gentleman  whose Mind is enrich'd with every noble Science and in whose Breast all the Virtues of Humanity are comprised it will be my Pride to offer my Sentiments in a more distinguishing Manner hereafter  I think it my Duty also to return Thanks to the Town for their favourable Reception of this Play and for the Applause their Indulgence bestow'd on the Performance of the  Young Actors  Particularly for my own Success in a double Capacity as  Actor  and  Author  I shall ever  publickly  confess  their Generosity  as it will ever prove  my secret Satisfaction  Notwithstanding the Disadvantage this Play may have received in the Representation I cannot omit acknowledging a Debt of  Gratitude  to  Mr  Theophilus Cibber  who was very careful in the Management of the Rehearsals and endeavour'd to instruct every one concern'd in the Play a Mechanism which my Inexperience as an  Actor  made me incapable of  Tho' an  Author  knows the Meaning of his Scenes he may be unacquainted with a  Theatrical  Method of setting 'em in the most advantageous Appearance  Example enforces Precept  and therefore Mr  Cibber junior  took the noblest Method to improve others by doing Justice to his own Character and tho' he labours under the present Disadvantage of small Stature I can't help concurring with the Opinion of many others that in  Action  and  Elocution  he is certainly a  Prodigy  PROLOGUE  Written by  AARON HILL  Esq  Spoken by Mr  CIBBER  Jun  _NEW to the StageBy no past Praises fir'd  Young and unfam'd and but by  Hope  inspir'd  Raise us to reach that Hope's ambitious Call  Or with  soft Pity  break our threaten'd Fall  Small tho'  our Merit  be  your Minds  are  Great  And  undeserv'd Applause  may Worth  create  Sweetness sits smiling where the Heart beats  true  And they  praise most  to whom most Praise is  due  Low let me court ye to befriend our Cause  If  Justice  pleads not gen'rous  Pity draws  In a  full World  our Author lives  Alone  Unhappy  and of Consequence  unknown  Yet amidst Sorrow he disdains Complaint  Nor languid in the Race of Life grows faint  He swims unyielding  against  Fortune's Stream  Nor to his  private Suff'rings  stoops his  Theme  Adopts  the Pains which others undergo  And for  your Pleasure  feels not his  own Woe  They shou'd  themselves  be  pleas'd  who love to  please  And he who fears not  Mis'ry  merits  Ease  Ohsave unfriended Virtue from  Distress  'Tis the  Divine Prerogative  to  bless  Sad for the  Tragic Scene  your Hearts prepare  Where Love  kills  Friendship and  awakes Despair  Where cherish'd Mischiefs tow'r above Controul  And warring Passions  rend  the tortur'd  Soul  Taught by the pictur'd Woes which weep tonight  Let longweigh'd  Caution  guide your Wishes

her Beauties from his barren Shade  To flourish by the Heat of Love and  Somerset  Ell  Never shall I forget the tempting Bride  Such dazling Lustre sparkled from her Eyes  That the proud Gems she wore shone dim beneath 'em  Inviting Warmth glow'd lovely on her Cheeks  And from her Tongue flow'd such melodious Sounds  That list'ning Rage grew gentle as her Accents  And Age was Youth again by looking on her  Nor  Yet tho' her Features are as soft as Air  Strong Passions urge her Mind to manly Daring  Work'd up by Nature with unusual Strength  Vengeance Ambition and the Warmth of Greatness  Swell in her Soul and lift her above Woman  Ell  That  Overbury  who oppos'd this Marriage  Will frown on its ConclusionHe's your Enemy  When corresponding with the Court of  Rome  'Twas he who intercepted dangerous Letters  Nor  He did nor think that I forget he did it  My Genius baleful as a Comet's Blaze  Hangs o'er his Head and burns with red Revenge  Nay he's my Rival tooThat fiery Thought  Glows in my Breast and as I weigh my Wrongs  I swell like  Aetna  when her sulph'rous Rage  Bursts o'er the Earth and rolls in Floods of Fire  Ell  Your  Isabella Somerset  's fair Charge  Is sure an Abstract of divine Perfection  While  Overbury  's Love like a black Cloud  Cuts off and intercepts the glittering Prospect  Nor  Oh name it notIt must not shall not be  Old as I am I'll snatch the Pleasure from him  And Love and Policy shall join to crush him  Ell  You know her Charms are  Somerset  's Disposal  Warm in the Lustre of our late Queen's Graces  'Tis strange to mark the Power of Time to change us  Her Father shone the Favourite of the Court  But when his Day of Hope at length declin'd  Drove by his Enemies he fled to  Scotland  Pine'd there and chill'd with Sorrows died an Exile  Nor  'Tis wellBut I have News more worth relating  Wade  the Lieutenant of the Tower's displac'd  Ell  May I remind your Lordship of a Promise  Nor  Thou need'st not  Ell'ways  I so truly prize thee  That were my Mind big with my Country's Fate  With Plots which known would blast my Life and Honour  I shou'd I think unfold 'em to thy Friendship  Of that hereafterSee the Bride approaches  Ex  Ell  Enter the Countess of  Somerset  Nor  Hail to those Charms that smile upon the Morn  And sweetly gild it like a milder Sun  May Joys in Circles dance away your Days  And Length of Years sustain your Bridal Pleasures  Fair  Somerset  now happy too and great  Blest with Perfection to the height of Thought  The Worth that could deserve Beauty like your's  Insures soft Bliss and heaps long Life with Pleasure  Count  Thuswhile a Lover talk'd my  Somerset  His Words fell short like hov'ring Flakes of Snow  And in cold Tremblings melted on my Bosom  But now alas  Nor  You cannot sure suspect him  Count  He has alarm'd  A Pride that catches the first Spark and kindles  To be forsaken is a Thought of Horror  Oh it wou'd grate the Woman in my Soul  To have my Pride subdu'd and make me mad  Tho' but last Night our Nuptials fix'd him mine  Starting this Morning from my slighted Arms  Thought seem'd to press his Mind Sighs heav'd his Bosom  And as repenting of his Wish possess'd  Full in the blushing Dawn he rose and left me  Nor  There is a Damp I know that clouds his Joys  A Vapour which your Warmth might soon disperse  Count  What points my Uncle at  Nor  I'll speak it plainly  Overbury  That restless Foe of oursyour Husband's Friend  This Morning is expected  Count  Overbury  Then aid me IndignationRageand Vengeance  Nor  Wisely you call on Rage for its Assistance  Justice would be too slow for your Revenge  And Conscience bids us give it up for ever  But what is Consciencea thin empty Name  That terrifies like Ghosts by Fancy rais'd  Ev'n the most Brave use Stratagems in War  And what are Plots against a private Foe  But SelfDefencethe first great Rule of Nature  Count  My Lord I see to what your Counsel leads me  I am a Woman nay a Woman wrong'd  And when our Sex from Injuries take Fire  Our Softness turns to FuryAnd our Thoughts  Breathe Vengeance and Destruction  Nor  Spoke like yourself  Count  Oh I'm transported with inspiring Heat  You know I never lov'd the Earl of  Somerset  'Twas Interest 'twas Ambition won me to him  And there's one Thought I own has rack'd my Peace  The only one I e'er conceal'd from you  Nor  Instruct meIt may serve us as a Plan  From which I'll raise a Pile of tow'ring Mischief  Shall nod with watchful Horror o'er his Head  Till tumbling it shall crush him into Ruin  Count  Know then with shame I speak it I have lov'd him  Nor  Lov'd whomnot  Overbury  Count  Yes lov'd him more than I detest him now  Each Thought Look Gesture has confest the Folly  Nay I have wroteOh Heav'n I know not what  Reason was fledand every Thought was Madness  And now he may betray me  Nor  May he will  These Letters must be artfully won from him  Succeeding we stir  Somerset  against him  Revenge with Transport then would sweeten all  The Rage of slighted Loveurge that discreetly  I know the Temper of your Lord'twill fire him  Touch but that Point and Jealousy pleads for you  But mark he comes and seems amus'd and pensive  'Tis fit we partanon we'll fix our Scheme  Exit  Count  Enter Earl of  Somerset  Som  A kind goodmorrow to my honour'd Uncle  Now Fortune seems to smile in earnest on me  This last Night's Blessing crown'd my warmest Wish  And kindling Fancy from the Thought takes Fire  Oh my good Lord Language gives way beneath it  The Painter's Colours and the Poet's Art  Cou'd touch but a faint Image of my Joys  Nor  And yet if I mistook you not at Entrance  Your Looks were low'ring and your Bosom labour'd  Thro' the gay Smile of your dissembled Joy  I saw th' obscuring Shade which wrap'd your Soul  Som  Sure you mistookI think I was all Rapture  How I adore your Niecebe witness Heaven  Witness ye soft Desires that swell my Veins  And beat but to the Music of her Love  Dearly I love her to Distraction love her  Nor Words can speaknor Thought can feel my Passion  ButOh  Northampton  Nor  Speak  Som  I have a Friend  Dearer than Life and as my Honour precious  Our Wishes and our Interests are the same  Friendship has join'd us in so strict a Band  As if one parcel'd Soul inform'd us both  Yet he  Nor  Let not his partial Hate of her perplex you  A Wise becomes the truest tend'rest Friend  The Balm of Comfort and the Source of Joy  Thro' every various Turn of Life the same  For Men they are not as they were of old  Oft their Professions are the Arts of Interest  You'll find the Friendship of the World is Show  Mere outward Show 'Tis like the Harlot's Tears  The Statesman's Promise or false Patriot's Zeal  Full of fair Seeming but Delusion all  Som  Not sothen might I think you not my Friend  Shall I because I live in faithless Times  Distrust a vertuous Man or shou'd I slight  A faithful FairOne 'cause her Sex are false  If these are Maxims Ties can bind no more  All that is humane is for ever lost  And Brutes are ev'n as we are  Nor  Come my Lord  This  Overbury  he's the Thorn that gauls you  Trust me I know him wellHe has a Soul  Too harshly form'd for such endearing Friendship  Som  Greatly you wrong him I have found him tender  As firstmade Mothers to their erring Infants  Firm to his Prince and faithful to his Country  A braver Subject  England  never boasted  Nor Man a nobler Friend than  Overbury  Nor  Can he be justly call'd your noblest Friend  Yet sacrifice your Bliss to private Malice  Let not a Show of Friendship make you wretched  Nor break the Bands which Heaven and Love have made  Som  Know you my Lord so little then of  Somerset  That you can wrong him with so poor a Thought  My Wife to tell you but how much I love her  'Twou'd like Eternity admit no End  Nor  I've doneyour safe Discretion be your Guide  Exit  Som  A Wife a Friend Oh they include all Joys  And Love and Friendship are so near akin  They shou'd like Poetry and Music join  Each form'd to grace the otherWhy then in me  Why in my Breast shou'd Friendship jar with Love  Enter Sir  Thomas Overbury  Som  Fly to my ArmsWelcome as Ease to Pain  As Health to Nature or Relief to Want  Over  O  Somerset  engraft me on thy Bosom  Each Day of Absence seem'd a ling'ring Age  But I have hasted ev'n to outstrip Time  Left the dull Hours behind me as I flew  And reach'd the Goal of all my Wishes here  Som  Friends who thus meet possess so soft a Bliss  That none but those who taste can guess our Joy  Over  May ours live to the last Verge of Being  Nay ev'n in Death for then if Thought remains  Shou'd mine but meet a Soul in Worlds to come  Whose generous Flame sublim'd it from the rest  I shou'd be apt to call it  Somerset  But tell mefor my Mind has dwelt upon thee  Has thy fond Heart regain'd its Liberty  Does the late  Essex  yet appear herself  Or art thou still bewitch'd with her Inchantment  Som  Alas thou know'st not what a Lover feels  Over  Have I a Soul for Friendship not for Love  There's one who knows my Softness but too well  Knows how her Beauty fires her Vertue charms me  Essex  I see still hangs her Witchcraft round thee  Som  Wou'dst thou but view her with impartial Eyes  Over  Why I confess she's fair and when she talks  Inchanting Softness melts upon her Tongue  And flows in Seas of MischiefShe has Beauty  Which spreads and blooms like a freshopening Flow'r  But poisonous Adders lurk beneath its Shade  And from such Briars shoots this lovely Rose  It wounds the Touch which it invites to crop it  Som  But let me beg thee if thou lov'st thy  Somerset  If Friendship makes my Peace of Mind thy Care  No more to shock me on this tender Point  Over  'Twere Flattery all not Friendship to comply  The Wound can ne'er be cur'd that shuns the probing  Kind is the Hand that wipes the Dust from Virtue  And Counsel is a Friend's peculiar Office  Som  Trust me my Friend that Counsel comes too late  Over  Hear mefor as I love thee I will speak  What tho' her outward Charms attract the Eye  Vertue the Gem within is long since faded  Her Fame like Flesh that blackens in the Sky  Is blown and bloated by the Breath of Thousands  Now as a Man weigh well e'er you resolve  For when a Woman's Reputation's gone  All that repenting Virtue can inspire  Can never fix it in its State again  Som  Cruel Report I know has wrong'd her Worth  Envy still feeds upon the fairest Fruit  And spreads its Poison on the Wings of Vertue  It blinds ev'n  Overbury  to accuse her  Over  My Lord my Lord I am no Stranger to her  Her Tryal with her late wrong'd Husband  Essex  Her loose Pretensions for that wish'd Divorce  I know it alland by my Soul I think  Dear as I love thee could'st thou stoop so low  As to receive that Wanton to thy Arms  'T wou'd shake my Friendship soI cou'd not scorn thee  But e'er I'd see thy ShameI'd range the World  And leave thee to the Ruin thou'rt so fond of  Should'st thou alaswhat mean those starting Tears  Big Drops of Sweatdead Palenesstrembling Limbs  Signs of some strong Confusion  Som  O my Friend  I must notcannot hide a Thought from thee  She from whose Charms your Friendship wou'd dissuade me  Is now my Wife  Over  Your Wife  Som  My much lov'd Wife  Over  Oh what are Men who loveMy Lord I've done  One Sigh to Friendship onlyand no more  All those convulsive Starts that shock thy Frame  Were the prophetic Warners of my Fall  Som  Said'st thou thy Fall fall first a thousand  Somersets  Over  That I still love theewitness this Embrace  Witness these Tearsbut from this fatal Hour  Join'd as you are to herwe part for ever  Som  O stoprepentrecall those hasty Words  What part for ever  Over  For ever our Alliance not our Love  Som  I fear I have no Friendbut  Overbury  Over  You have a Wife and Friendship is her Office  It stings my Soul to see thee thus betray'd  And my foreboding Heart e'en bleeds with Pity  All that is left me now is to avoid thee  And not to see what but to hear will kill me  Farewell my Lordmay ceaseless Blessings wait you  Exit  Somerset  alone  Som  Sorrow eternal Sorrow claims me now  All happy Fortune flies for ever from me  Whate'er's worth wishing for on Earth I've lost  Life is a Dream disturb'd by constant Cares  And he who is not lov'd finds Death a Blessing  Friendship's dear Ties for generous Souls were made  When they relax black Woes our Peace invade  Friendship from every Ill can Life defend  Our Guardian Angel's but a faithful Friend  Exit  ACT II SCENE I  continues  Isabella Cleora  Cleo  _WHY  Isabella  are these Sighs of Sorrow  While crouding Joys invite your blooming Youth  Love rears a thousand little tender Fears  Fate with a Smile auspicious bids you hope  To fear is to distrust a Power Supreme  The watchful Guard of Vertue in Distress  Isa  Have I not cause to fear a thousand Ills  Cleo  No your lov'd  Overbury  comes to chear you  Then let weak Malice work up threatning Mischief  Soon shall the Fairy Structure melt away  Tho'  Somerset  's new Bride tries every Wile  That slighted Love to Hatred turn'd can practise  Her Soul's chief Secrets she unfolds to me  As I to you disclose 'em  Isa  Kind  Cleora  Our Friendship grew and ripen'd with our Years  When forc'd to lose thee at my Father's Death  How mournful was our Parting I bless'd the Chance  When I beheld thee with my Guardian's Bride  Companion of her Hours  Cleo  Of me no more  Now let your  Overbury  fill your Thoughts  And every Accent swell with Sounds of Love  Isa  Oh my  Cleora  he will ne'er be mine  A dreadful Dream last Night has warn'd my Soul  Love had methought ordain'd our Nuptial Rites  But sudden while before the Priest we stood  A low'ring Cloud hung o'er the Temple's Roof  And with slow Horror spread a fleecy Darkness  From its black Center burst a rattling Shower  The lab'ring Air groan'd big with rolling Thunder  Red thro' the gather'd Gloom flash'd Lightning broke  And the rent Veillet in a dreadful Glare  Which with portentous Quiverings gleam'd upon us  The Altar totter'dand the Lights grew dim  A hollow Wind sigh'd coldand from their Graves  Pale Ghosts stalk'd shadowy and scream'd hideous round me  But Oharound my Love fierce Brightness glitter'd  A Fire triumphant curl'd about his Form  And winding upward snatch'd him from my Sight  Cleo  Yet he's not lostSee where he smiling comes  Let me not stay to interrupt your Joys  Exit  Enter  Overbury  Over  O take me take me to thy Heav'nly Bosom  Here let me pour out all my hoarded Thoughts  Here tower my Joys my Cares be here dispers'd  Isa  I have a thousand tender things to say  A thousand Doubts at once to be resolv'd  Three tedious Months have heavily roll'd on  And not one Thought perhaps has chid thy Stay  But while thy Voice so sweetly strikes my Ear  My Joys revive and melt away my Sadness  Over  Let my Soul bless the Music of those Words  My Heart breaks rapt'rous at the softning Sound  I feast my famish'd Eyes upon thy Smiles  I touch theeand am lost in Extasy  A Tide of thrilling Joy flows thro' my Veins  I part with Pleasure and I burn with Love  Isa  I cannot if I wou'd disguise my Thoughts  Tho 'tis perhaps a Fault to look thus kindly  But Oh bewarefor thou hast dangerous Foes  Beware  Northampton  who pretends to love me  Beware the Woman who deludes thy Friend  Watchful I strive to counterplot their Mischief  And guard thy Vertue from impending Danger  Over  Oh thou rich Source of everlasting Pleasure  Virtues rise mix'd and sparkle in thy Soul  One glittering Charm pursues another's Shine  As while I cut those Seas which brought me near thee  Sweet Sunreflecting Waves roll'd glassy on  And this no sooner kiss'd the Shore and dy'd  But a new Follower 'rose and swell'd as lovely  Enter  Northampton  Nor  Why start you Madamat a Lover's Presence  Unveil your clouded Beautysince this Morning  A smiling Sun looks gay on our Friend's Nuptials  Isa  My Lord I want the Courtier  Nor  Not the Woman  I see a too successful Rival near you  Sir I shou'd speak you welcomeYou are happy  But Madam since your Charms may be neglected  For Boys unskill'd find Gems whose Worth they know not  When such your Fortune proves think of  Northampton  And smile tho late on one who lives to love you  Over  My Lord this Injury but provokes my Scorn  The next may move my Anger  Nor  Am I threaten'd  A waythou buzzing Insect of the Court  Over  Reproaches are too mean for brave Mens Anger  Or I could sting thy Arrogance with talking  Be wise nor urge my Sword against thy Meanness  Worn for a nobler Quarrel  Nor  Sir 'tis well  When we meet next what now remains to say  May be debated  Over  At your speediest Leisure  Leads off  Isab  Northampton  solus  Nor  Well  Overbury  thou dost right to spurn me  If Plots have Power if Oaths have force to crush thee  If there's a Magic Spell beneath the Moon  Or Poison can be drawn from baneful Plants  Then Horror from my Fury light upon thee  Enter Countess of  Somerset  Count  My Lord I know not if I'm yet betray'd  My Foe shot by me with a gloomy Brow  Nor bow'd his Head in passing  Nor  Saw you your Lord  Count  I did and strangely mov'd  The usual Sweetness of his Nature's lost  With folded Arms he traverses the Room  Now rednow pale big on his watry Eyes  Prompt Tears stand tremblingspeak to him and he sighs  Or shakes his Headand groans an hollow Answer  Then on a sudden startsand flies Observance  Nor  Now is the Time to fire him to our Purpose  Their Friendship broke I have a further Plot  E'er Night this  Overbury  sees the Tower  Count  Woolsey  nor  Burleigh  e'er projected better  Nor  Haste we to execute Resolves of Weight  An active Fire shou'd quicken vast Conceptions  For when Delay's cold Influence chills our Schemes  Some adverse Fate comes like a furious Blast  And kills 'em e'er they ripen into Action  Count  O I can match thee with an equal Flame  Not e'en the Soldier's Fury rais'd in War  The Rage of Tyrants when Defiance stings 'em  The Pride of Priests so bloody when in Power  Are half so dreadful as a Woman's Vengeance  Nor  'Tis a warm Thought and fires the mounting Soul  Revenge dares strike at every thing  Rivers of Blood mark out the smiling Way  And Kingdoms flame to give her Triumphs Lustre  Welcome dread Vengeance as I weigh my Wrongs  I swell like  Aetna  when her sulph'rous Rage  Bursts o'er the Earth and rolls in Floods of Fire  Count  Let the Priestridden Vulgar worship Vertue  Thou virtuous  Overbury  sleep and dream  Dream of Philosophy and puzzling Honour  Of heavenly Visions and immortal Shadows  Till slow Revenge leaps suddenly upon thee  Then startbehold who strikes and so expire  Nor  Soft the Earl comesbe on the nicest Guard  Prove thy Success but vast as are thy Wishes  Thy Name shall swell on Fame's immortal Voice  A Wonder among Women  Ex  Count  He comesnow aid me all my Sex's Falshood  Enter  Somerset  musing  Som  Men say our Thoughts distinguish us from Brutes  Wou'd I had never thoughtI had then been happy  Reflection rivets Woe upon the Wretched  Thought teaches me to feel a Friend's lost Worth  When we have Friends to them we trust our Griefs  Our Care lies lighten'd and the Mind sleeps calm  To me that Comfort 's lostI have no Friend  Oh I cou'd pine away this wretched Life  Lean like a Willow trembling o'er a Brook  Sigh with the Winds and murmur with the Stream  Count  His Heart seems press'd with Care  Aside  My gentle Lord  Why leave you thus the Gaiety of Friends  And why has grinding Grief usurp'd your Soul  Som  I found myself disorder'd and I left you  Oft am I thusLeave me I'll soon return  Count  Oh my dear Lord I am not soon deceiv'd  Those carebent Brows suit not a Bridegroom's Face  Are folded Arms the Gestures of Delight  Or these sad Groans the Voice of inward Joy  No noconsider I am now your Wife  'Tis mine to ease your Cares and bring you Comfort  If you have Sorrows I must claim my Part  I sink not soon beneath a Weight of Woe  If you deny me this you love me not  Som  Not love thee say'st thou Oh thou Soul of  Somerset  Cou'd those bright Eyes be turn'd into my Breast  There wou'd you see how your Suspicion wrongs me  Let me look nighlet me gaze here with Wonder  Where's Friendship now Why Reason yields to Beauty  What tho' the Crimes of which her Foes accuse her  Glar'd broad as Daylight on my startled Soul  Angels play smiling in her wanton Eyes  And lend an Awe to LightnessLove reigns round her  And when she speaksthe softest sweetest Music  Melts in her Voice and charms away my Grief  Count  Oh with what Art you sooth my fainting Spirits  Then I am still your dear your muchlov'd Wife  Why do I ask those Eyes confess I am  But tell mefor you shou'd impart your Cares  Why are you thus  Som  Oh  Count  Nay again you're cruel  Still when I strive to search the Cause your Voice  Sinks from the Point and answers with a Groan  Som  What CauseI told thee I had been disorder'd  Thy Fears are the wild Coinage of thy Fancy  A subtle SelfTormentor  Count  'Tis well my Lord  I guess to whom I owe my Loss of Power  You have a Friend can tell you Tales of Honour  And teach you how to triumph o'er a Wife  Who has indeed had Faultsbut whose chief Crime  Is loving you perhaps with too much Fondness  Som  What dost thou meanwhat Friend  Count  Why  Overbury  I know your Tutor chides your faulty Conduct  Go then and make your Peacebe meekly penitent  Promise to err no moreand he'll forgive you  Som  Hear me sweet TyrantBy my Life I swear  Thou'rt dear to me as Crowns to the Ambitious  Dear as these Eyes which tremble on thy Charms  Or as this Heart which akes with Joy and Anguish  Count  Then I must tell you Sir your Friend's a Villain  Som  Have a care  Let not thy Rage transport thee to Detraction  Count  Oh were I but to speak his base Attempt  Som  What base Attempt  Count  No matter what it is  I sure may be allow'd some Secrets too  Som  Nay this is wrongto brand him first with Villain  Then in a dusky Phrase elude the Charge  Truth seldom lies conceal'd in Mystery  Clearly to Reason she reveals her Light  And Errors vanish like a Mist
