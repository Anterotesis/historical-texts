THERE are I scarce can think it but am told  There are to whom my Satire seems too bold  Scarce to wise  Peter  complaisant enough  And something said of  Chartres  much too rough  The Lines are weak another's pleas'd to say  Lord  Fanny  spins a thousand such a Day  Tim'rous by Nature of the Rich in awe  I come to Council learned in the Law  You'll give me like a Friend both sage and free  Advice and as you use without a Fee  L  I'd write no more  P  Not write but then I  think  And for my Soul I cannot sleep a wink  I nod in Company I wake at Night  Fools rush into my Head and so I write  L  You could not do a worse thing for your Life  Why if the Nights seem tedioustake a Wife  Or rather truly if your Point be Rest  Lettuce and Cowslip Wine  Probatum est  But talk with  Celsus Celsus  may advise  Hartshorn or something that shall close your Eyes  Or if you needs must write write CAESAR'S Praise  You'll gain at least a  Knighthood  or the  Bays  P  What like Sir  Richard  rumbling rough and fierce  With ARMS and GEORGE and BRUNSWICK crowd the Verse  Or nobly wild with  Budgell  's Fire and Force  Paint Angels trembling round his  falling Horse  L  Then all your Muse's softer Art display  Let  Carolina  smooth the tuneful Lay  Lull with  Amelia  's liquid Name the Nine  And sweetly flow through all the Royal Line  P  Alas few Verses touch their nicer Ear  They scarce can bear their  Laureate  twice a Year  And justly CAESAR scorns the Poet's Lays  It is to  History  he trusts for Praise  L  Better be  Cibber  I'll maintain it still  Than ridicule all  Taste  blaspheme  Quadrille  Abuse the City's best good Men in Metre  And laugh at Peers that put their Trust in  Peter  Ev'n those you touch not hate you  P  What should ail 'em  L  A hundred smart in  Timon  and in  Balaam  The fewer still you name you wound the more  Bnd  is but one but  Harpax  is a Score  P  Each Mortal has his Pleasure None deny  Scle  his Bottle  Dty  his HamPye  Ridotta  sips and dances till she see  The doubling Lustres dance as well as she  loves the  Senate HockleyHole  his Brother  Like in all else as one Egg to another  I love to pour out all myself as plain  As downright  Shippen  or as old  Montagne  In them as certain to be lov'd as seen  The Soul stood forth nor kept a Thought within  In me what Spots for Spots I have appear  Will prove at least the Medium must be clear  In this impartial Glass my Muse intends  Fair to expose myself my Foes my Friends  Publish the present Age but where my Text  Is Vice too high reserve it for the next  My Foes shall wish my Life a longer date  And ev'ry Friend the less lament my Fate  My Head and Heart thus flowing thro' my Quill  Verseman or Proseman term me which you will  Papist or Protestant or both between  Like good  Erasinus  in an honest Mean  In Moderation placing all my Glory  While Tories call me Whig and Whigs a Tory  Satire's my Weapon but I'm too discreet  To run a Muck and tilt at all I meet  I only wear it in a Land of Hectors  Thieves Supercargoes Sharpers and Directors  Save but our  Army  and let  Jove  incrust  Swords Pikes and Guns with everlasting Rust  Peace is my dear Delightnot  Fleury  's more  But touch me and no Minister so sore  Whoe'er offends at some unlucky Time  Slides into Verse and hitches in a Rhyme  Sacred to Ridicule his whole Life long  And the sad Burthen of some merry Song  Slander or Poyson dread from  Delia  's Rage  Hard Words or Hanging if your Jge be  From furious  Sappho  yet a sadder Fate  Px'd by her Love or libell'd by her Hate  Its proper Pow'r to hurt each Creature feels  Bulls aim their horns and Asses lift their heels  'Tis a Bear's Talent not to kick but hug  And no man wonders he's not stung by Pug  So drink with  Wtrs  or with  Chtrs  eat  They'll never poison you they'll only cheat  Then learned Sir to cut the Matter short  Whate'er my Fate or well or ill at Court  Whether old Age with faint but chearful Ray  Attends to gild the Evening of my Day  Or Death's black Wing already be display'd  To wrap me in the Universal Shade  Whether the darken'd Room to muse invite  Or whiten'd Wall provoke the Skew'r to write  In Durance Exile Bedlam or the Mint  Like  Lee  or  Bll  I will Rhyme and Print  L  Alas young Man your Days can ne'r be long  In Flow'r of Age you perish for a Song  Plums and Directors  Shylock  and his Wife  Will club their Testers now to take your Life  P  What arm'd for  Virtue  when I point the Pen  Brand the bold Front of shameless guilty Men  Dash the proud Gamester in his gilded Car  Bare the mean Heart that lurks beneath a Star  Can there be wanting to defend Her Cause  Lights of the Church or Guardians of the Laws  Could pension'd  Boileau  lash in honest Strain  Flatt'rers and Bigots ev'n in  Louis'  Reign  Could Laureate  Dryden  Pimp and Fry'r engage  Yet neither  Charles  nor  James  be in a Rage  And I not  strip the Gilding off a Knave  Unplac'd unpension'd no Man's Heir or Slave  I will or perish in the gen'rous Cause  Hear this and tremble you who 'scape the Laws  To VIRTUE ONLY and HER FRIENDS A FRIEND  The World beside may murmur or commend  Know all the distant Din that World can keep  Rolls o'er my  Grotto  and but sooths my Sleep  There my Retreat the best Companions grace  Chiefs out of War and Statesmen out of Place  There  St John  mingles with my friendly Bowl  The Feast of Reason and the Flow of Soul  And He whose Lightning pierc'd th'  Iberian  Lines  Now forms my Quincunx and now ranks my Vines  Or tames the Genius of the stubborn Plain  Almost as quickly as he conquer'd  Spain  Envy  must own I live among the Great  No Pimp of Pleasure and no Spy of State  With Eyes that pry not Tongue that ne'er repeats  Fond to spread Friendships but to cover Heats  To help who want to forward who excel  This all who know me know who love me tell  And who unknown defame me let them be  Scriblers or Peers alike are  Mob  to me  This is my Plea on this I rest my Cause  What saith my Council learned in the Laws  L  Your Plea is good But still I say beware  Laws are explain'd by Menso have a care  It stands on record that in ancient Times  A Man was hang'd for very honest Rhymes  Consult the Statute  quart  I think it is  Edwardi Sext  or  prim quint Eliz  See  Libels Satires  there you have itread  P  Libels  and  Satires  lawless Things indeed  But grave  Epistles  bringing Vice to light  Such as a  King  might read a  Bishop  write  Such as Sir  Robert  would approve  L  Indeed  The Case is alter'dyou may then proceed  In such a Cause the Plaintiff will be hiss'd  My Lords the Judges laugh and you're dismiss'd  FINIS
