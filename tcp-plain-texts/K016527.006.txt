 THE HISTORY OF Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  IN A SERIES of LETTERS Published from the ORIGINALS By the Editor of PAMELA and CLARISSA  In SEVEN VOLUMES  VOL VI  LONDON  Printed by S RICHARDSON AND  DUBLIN  Reprinted and sold by the Booksellers M DCC LIII  THE HISTORY OF Sir CHARLES GRANDISON Bart  LETTER I  Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT  Mansfieldhouse  Thursday Sept    _YOU will be so good my dear friend as to let my neighbours particularly the gentlemen you mention know that the only reason I forbear paying my compliments to them now I am so near is because I cannot as yet enjoy their company with that freedom and ease which I hope in a little while to do Tell them that I purpose after some particular affairs are determined which will for a little while longer engross me to devote the greatest part of my time to my native place and that then I will endeavour to make myself as good a neighbour and as social a friend as they can wish me to be  On Sunday I had a visit from the two Hartleys  They gave me very satisfactory proofs of what they were able to do as well as willing in support of the right of the Mansfields to the estate of which they have been despoiled and shewed me a paper which nobody thought was in being of the utmost consequence in the cause  On Monday by appointment I attended Sir John Lambton Two lawyers of the Keelings were with him They produced their demands I had mine ready but theirs were so extravagant that I would not produce them But taking Sir John aside I love not said I to affront men of a profession but I am convinced that we never shall come to an understanding if we consider ourselves as Lawyers and Clients I am no lawyer but I know the strength of my friends cause and will risque half my estate upon the justice of it The Mansfields will commission  me  if the Keelings will  you  and we perhaps may do something If not let the Law take its course I am now come to reside in England I will do nothing for myself till I have done what can be done to make all my friends easy  Sir John owned that he thought the Mansfields had hardships done them Mr Keeling senior he said had heard of the paper in the Hartley's hands and praising his honesty told me in confidence that he had declared that if such a paper could have been produced in time he would not have prosecuted the suit which he had carried But Sir John said that the younger Keeling was a furious young man and would oppose a compromise on the terms he supposed the Mansfields would expect to be complied with But what are your proposals Sir  These Sir John The Law is expensive delays may be meditated appeals may be brought if we gain our pointWhat I think it may cost us to establish the right of the injured which cannot be a small sum that will I prevail upon the Mansfields to  give up to the Keelings I will trust you if you give me your honour with our proofs and if you and your friends are satisfied with them and will consent to establish our right by the form only of a new trial then may we be agreed Otherwise not And I leave you and them to consider of it I shall hear from you within two or three days Sir John promised I should but hoped to have some talk first with the Hartleys with whom as well as with me he declared he would be upon honour  Wednesday Evening  I HAD a message from Sir John last night requesting me to dine with him and the elder Mr Keeling this day and to bring with me the two Mr Hartleys and the proofs I had hinted at  Those gentlemen were so obliging as to go with me and took the important paper with them which had been deposited with their grandfather as a common friend and contained a recognition of the Mansfields right to the estates in question upon an amicable reference to persons long since departed An attested copy of which was once in the Mansfields possession as by a memorandum that came to hand but which never could be found The younger Keeling was not intended to be there but he forced himself upon us He behaved very rudely I had once like to have forgot myself This meeting produced nothing But as the father is a reasonable man as we have obtained a rehearing of the cause as he is much influenced by Sir John Lambton who seems convinced and to whose honour I have submitted an abstract of our proofs I am in hopes that we shall be able to accommodate  I have Bolton's proposals before me The first child is dead the second cannot live many months He trembles at the proofs he knows we have of his villainy He offers on the death of this second child to give us possession of the estate and a large sum of  money but thought not to be half of what the superannuated Calvert left if we will give him general releases The wretch is not we believe married to the relict of Calvert  I am loth methinks to let him escape the justice which his crimes call for But such are the delays and chicaneries of the law when practisers are found who know how to perplex an honest pursuer and as we must have recourse to low and dirty people to establish our proofs the vile fellow shall take with him the proposed spoils They may not be much more than would be the lawyers part of the estate were we to push the litigation  As to our poor Everard nothing I fear can be done for him with the men who are revelling on  his  spoils I have seen one of them The unhappy man has signed and sealed to his own ruin He regrets that a part of the estate which has been so long in the family and name should go out of it What an empty pride is that of name The general tenor of his life was not a credit to it tho' he felt not that till he felt distress The disgrace is actually incurred Does not all the world know his loss and the winner's triumph And if the world did not can he conceal from himself those vices the consequences of which have reduced him to what he is But perhaps the unhappy man puts a value upon the name in compliment to me  Mention not to him what I write The poor man is sensible enough of his folly to engage pity Whether from a right sense or not must be left to his own heart  As to the woman's claim What in honour can I do against a promise that he owns may be proved upon him He did not condition with her that she was to be a spotless woman If he thought she was so when he solicited her to yield to his desires he is the less to be excused Vile as she comes out to be  he had proposed to make her as vile if he had found her not so He promised her marriage Meant he only a promise  She  is punished in being what she  is His  punishment cannot be condign but by his being obliged to perform his promise Yet I cannot bear to think that my cousin Grandison should be made for life the dupe of a successful and premeditated villainy and the less as in all likelihood the profligate Lord B would continue to himself from the merit with her of having vindicated her claim an interest in the bad woman's favour were she to be the wife of our poor Everard  But certainly this claim must be prosecuted with a view only to extort money from my cousin and they know him to be of a family jealous of its honour I think she must be treated with for releases I could not bear to appear in such a cause as this in open court in support of my cousin against a promise made by him He is of age and thought to be no novice in the ways of the town I am mistaken in Mr Grandison's spirit if it did not lead him to think himself very severely punished were he to have no other punishment for those vices which were to be expensive to  me  But if I should be able to extricate the unhappy man from this difficulty what can next be done for him The poor remains of his fortune will not support one who has always lived  more  than genteelly Will he be able think you to endure the thoughts of living in a constant state of dependence however easy and genteel I should endeavour to make it to him There may be many ways in the public offices for example of providing for a broken tradesman But for a man who calls himself and is a gentleman who will expect as such to rank with his employer who knows nothing of figures or business of any kind who has been brought up in idleness and hardly knows the meaning of the word  diligence  and never  could bear confinement what can be done for such a one in the public offices or by any other employment that requires punctual attendance  But to quit this subject for a more agreeable one  I have for some time had it in my thoughts to ask you my dear friend Whether your nephew is provided for to  your  liking and his  own  If not and he would put it in  my  power to serve  him  by serving  myself  I should be obliged to  you  for permitting him so to do and to  him  for his consent I would not affront him by the offer of a salary My presents to him shall be such as befit the services doneSometimes as my amanuensis sometimes as a transcriber and methodizer of Papers and Letters sometimes in adjusting servants accounts and fitting them for my inspection You need not fear my regard to  myself  in my acknowlegements to be made to him that I know will be all your fear for I have always considered profusion and parsimony as two extremes equally to be avoided You my dear Dr Bartlett have often enforced this lesson on my mind Can it then ever be forgotten by  Your affectionate Friend and Servant CHARLES GRANDISON  LETTER II  Signor  JERONYMO  della  PORRETTA  To Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  Bologna  Monday Sept    N S  YOUR kind Letters from Lyons my dearest friend rejoiced us extremely Clementina languished to hear from you How was it possible for you to write with so much warmth of affection to her yet with so much delicacy that a rival could not take exceptions at it  She writes to you It is not for me it is not for  any of us I think to say one word to the principal subject of her Letter She shewed it to me and to her mother only  Dear creature Could she be prevailed uponBut how can you be asked to support the familywishes Yet if you think them just I know you will You know not  Self  when justice and the service of your friend stand in opposition to it All that I am afraid of is that we shall be too precipitate for the dear creature's head  Would to God you could have been my Brother That was the first desire of my heartBut you will see by her Letter the least flighty that she has written of a long time that she has no thought of that And she declares to us that she wishes you happily married to an Englishwoman Would to Heaven we might plead  your  example to  her  I will certainly attend you in your EnglandIf one thing that we all wish could happen you would have the whole family as far as I know We think we talk of nobody but you We look out for Englishmen to do them honour for your sake  Mrs Beaumont is with us Surely she is your near relation She advises caution but thinks that our present measures are not wrong ones as we never can give into my sister's wishes to quit the world Dear Grandison love not Mrs Beaumont the less for her opinion in our favour  Mr Lowther writes to you I say nothing therefore of that worthy man  I am wished to write more enforcingly to you on a certain important subject But I say I cannot dare not will not  Dear Grandison love still your Jeronymo Your friendship makes life worthy of my wish It has been a consolation to me when every other failed and all around me was darkness and the shadow of death You will often be troubled with Letters from  me My beloved my dearest friend my Grandison adieu  JERONYMO della PORRETTA  LETTER III  Lady  CLEMENTINA  To Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  Bologna  Monday Sept    N S  HOW welcome to me was your Letter from Lyons My good Chevalier Grandison my heart thanks you for it Yet it was possible that heart could have been still more thankful had I not observed in your Letter an air of pensiveness tho' it is endeavoured to be concealed What pain would it give me to know that you suffer on my accountBut no more in this strain A complaining one must take place  O Chevalier I am persecuted And by whom By my dearest my nearest friends I was afraid it would be so Why why would you deny me your influence when I importuned you for it Why would you not stay among us till you saw me professed Then had I been happyIn  time  I should have been happyNow am I beset with entreaties with supplications from those who ought to commandyet unlawfully if they did I presume to think so Since parents tho' they ought to be consulted in the change of condition as to the  person  yet surely should not oblige the child to marry who chooses to be single all her life A more cogent reason may be pleaded and I do plead it to my relations as Catholics as I wish for nothing so much as to assume the veilBut you are a Protestant You favour not a Divine dedication and would not plead for me On the contrary you have strengthened their handsO Chevalier how could you do so and ever love me Did you not know there was but one way to  escape the grievous consequences of the importunities of those who justly lay claim to my obedienceAnd they  do  claim it  And in what forcible manner claim itShall I tell you Thus then My father with tears in his eyes beseeches me My mother gently reminds me of what she has suffered for me in my illness and declares that it is in my power to make the rest of her days happy Nor shall she think my own tranquility of mind secured ▪till I oblige herO Chevalier what pleas are these from a father whose eyes plead more strongly than words and from a mother on whose bright days I cast a cloudThe Bishop pleads How can a Catholic Bishop plead and not for me The General declares that he never wooed his beloved wife for her consent with more fervour than he does me for mine to oblige them all Nay Jeronymo Blush sisterly love to say itJeronymo your friend Jeronymo is solicitous on the same sideEven Father Marescotti is carried away by the example of the BishopMrs Beaumont argues with me in their favourAnd Camilla who was ever full of your praises teazes me continually  They name not the man They pretend to leave me free to choose through the world They plead that zealous as they are in the Catholic faith they were  so  earnest for me to enter into the state that they were desirous to see me the wife even of a Protestant rather than I should remain single And they remind me that it was owing to my scruple only that this was not effectedBut why why will they weaken rather than strengthen my scruple Could I have got over three pointsThe sense of my own unworthiness after my mind had been disturbed The  insuperable  apprehension that drawn aside by your Love I should probably have ensnared my own Soul and that I should be perpetually lamenting the certainty of the loss of his whom it would be my  duty to love as my own their importunity would hardly have been wanted  Tell me advise me my good Chevalier my fourth brother You are not Now  interested  in the debate if I may not lawfully stand out Tell me as I know that I cannot answer their views except I marry and yet cannot consent to marry whether I may not as well sequester myself from the world and insist upon so doing  What what can I doI am distressedO thou my  Brother  my Friend whom my heart ever must hold dear advise me To you I have told them I will appeal They are so good as to promise to suspend their solicitations if I will hold suspended my thoughts of the veil till I have your adviceBut give it not against meIf you ever valued Clementina  Give it not against her  LETTER IV  Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  To Lady  CLEMENTINA  London  Monday Sept    WHAT can I say most excellent of women to the contents of the Lerter you have honoured me with What a task have you imposed upon me You take great and respecting your intentions I will call it  kind  care to let me know that I can have no interest in the decision of the case you refer to me I repeat my humble acquiescence but must again declare that it would have been next to impossible to do so had you not made a point of conscience of your scruples  But what weight is my advice likely to have with a young Lady who repeatedly in the close of her Letter desires me not to give it  for  her parents  I madam am  far  from being unprejudiced in this case For can the man who once himself hoped for  the honour of your hand advise you against MarriageAre not your parents generously indulgent when they name not any particular person to you I applaud both their wisdom and their goodness on this occasion Possibly you  guess  the man whom they would recommend to your choice And I am sure Lady Clementina would not refuse their recommendation merely because it was  theirs  Nor indeed upon any less reason than an unconquerable aversion or a preference to some other Catholic A Protestant it seems it  cannot  be  But let me ask my Sister my Friend What answer can I return to the Lady who had shewn in one instance that she had not an insuperable aversion to Matrimony yet on conscientious reasons refusing one man and not particularly favouring any can scruple to oblige  obey  is not the word they use  'a Father who with tears in his eyes beseeches her a Mother who gently reminds her of what she has suffered for her who declares that it is in her power to make the rest of her days happy and who urges a still stronger plea respecting them both and the whole family to engage the attention of the beloved daughter"O madam what pleas are those Let me still make use of your own pathetic words from a Father whose eyes plead more strongly than words and from a Mother over whose bright days you had tho' involuntarily cast a cloudYour Brother the Bishop a man of piety your Confssor a man of equal piety your two other Brothers your disinterested Friend Mrs Beaumont your faithful Camilla all wholly disinterested'  What an enumeration against yourselfForbidden as I am to give the cause  against  you what can I say Dearest Lady Clementina can I on your own representation give it  for  you  You know madam the sacrifice I have made to the plea of  your  conscience not  my  own I make  no doubt but parents so indulgent as yours will yield to your reasons if you can plead  conscience  against the performance of the  filial duty  the more a duty as it is so gently urged Nay hardly urged but by tears and wishes which the eyes not the lips express and which if you will perform your parents will think themselves under an obligation to their child  Lady Clementina is one of the most generous of women But consider madam in this instance of prefering your own will to that of the most indulgent of parents whether there is not an apparent selfishness inconsistent with your general character even were you to be as happy in a convent as you propose Would you not in that case live to yourself and renounce your parents and family as parts of that world which you would vow to despiseDear Lady I asked you once before Is there any thing sinful in a Sacrament Such all good Catholics deem Matrimony And shall I ask you Whether as selfdenial is held to be meritorious in your church there is not a merit in denying yourself in the case before us when you can by performing the filial duty oblige your whole family  Permit me to say that tho' a Protestant I am not an enemy to such foundations in general I could wish under proper regulations that we had Nunneneries among us I would not indeed have the obligation upon Nuns be perpetual Let them have liberty at the end of every two or three years to renew their vows or otherwise by the consent of friends Celibacy in the Clergy is an indispensable law of your church Yet a Cardinal has been allowed to lay down the purple and marry You know madam I must mean Ferdinand of Medicis Familyreasons in that case preponderated as well at Rome as at Florence  Of all the women I know Lady Clementina della Porretta should be the last who should be earnest to take the veil There can be but two persons in the world besides herself who will not be grieved at her  choice We know  their  reasons The will of her grandfathers now with God is against her and her living parents and every other person of her family those  two  excepted would be made unhappy if she sequestered herself from the world and them Clementina has charity She wishes she once said to take a great revenge upon Laurana Laurana has something to repent of Let  her  take the veil The fondness she has for the world a fondness which could make her break through all the ties of relation and humanity requires a check But are any of those in convents more pious more exemplary pious than Clementina is out of them  Much more could I urge on the same side of the question but what I have urged has been a  task  upon me a task which I could not have performed had I not preferred to my own the happiness of you and your family  May both earthly and heavenly blessings attend your determination whatever it be prays dearest madam  Your everfaithful Friend Affectionate Brother and Humble Servant CH GRANDISON  LETTER V  Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  To Signor  JERONYMO  della  PORRETTA  London  Sat Sept    I Have written my beloved friend to Lady Clementina and shall inclose a copy of my Letter  I own that till I received hers I thought there was a possibility tho' not a probability that she might change her mind in my favour I  foresaw  that you would all join for familyreasons to press her to  marry And when thought I she finds herself very earnestly urged it is possible that she will forego her scruples and proposing some conditions for herself will honour with her hand the man whom she has avowedly honoured with a place in her heart rather than any other The malady she has been afflicted with often leaves for some time an unsteadiness in the mind My absence as I proposed to settle in my native country never more perhaps to return to Italy the high notions she has of obligation and gratitude her declared confidence in my honour and affection all cooperating she may thought I change her mind and if she does I cannot doubt the favour of her friends It was not my Jeronymo presumptuous to  hope  It was  justice  to Clementina to attend the event and to wait for the promised Letter But now that I see you are all of one mind and that the dear Lady tho' vehemently urged by all her friends to marry some other man can appeal to me only as to her  fourth Brother  and a man  not interested  in the eventI give up all my hopes  I have written accordingly to your dear Clementina but it could not be expected that I should give the argument all the weight that might be given it Yet being of opinion that she was in duty obliged to yield to the entreaties of all her friends I have been honest But surely no man ever was involved in so many difficult situations as your Grandison who yet never by enterprize or rashness was led out of the plain path into difficulties so uncommon  You wish my dear friend that I would set an example to your excellent sister I will unbosom my heart to you  There is a Lady an English Lady beautiful as an Angel but whose beauty is her least perfection either in my eyes or her own Had I never known Clementina I could not have loved her and  only  her of all the women I ever beheld It would not be doing her  justice if I could not say I  do  love her but with a flame as pure as the heart of Clementina or as her own heart can boast Clementina's distressed mind affected me I imputed her sufferings to her esteem for me The farewel interview denied her she demonstrated I thought so firm an affection for me at the same time that she was to me what I may truly call a first Love that tho▪ the difficulties in my way seemed insuperable I thought it became me in honour in gratitude to hold myself in suspense and not offer to make my addresses to any other woman till the destiny of the dear Clementina was determined  It would look like vanity in me to tell my Jeronymo how many proposals from the partial friends of women of rank and merit superior to my own I thought myself obliged in honour to the Ladies themselves to decline But my heart never suffered uneasiness from the uncertainty I was in of ever succeeding with your beloved sister but on this Lady's account I presume not however to say I could have succeeded had I thought myself at liberty to make my addresses to her Yet when I suffered myself to balance because of my uncertainty with your Clementina I had hopes from the interest my two sisters had with her her affections disengaged that had I been at liberty to make my addresses to her I might  Shall I my dear Jeronymo own the truthThe two noblestminded women in the world when I went over to Italy on the invitation of my Lord the Bishop held almost an equal interest in my heart and I was thereby enabled justly and with the greater command of myself to declare to the Marchioness and the General at my last going over that I held myself bound to you but that your sister and you all were free But when the dear Clementina began to shew signs of recovery and seemed to confirm the hopes I had of her partiality to me and my gratitude and attachment seemed of importance to her complete  restoration then my Jeronymo did I content myself with wishing another husband to the English Lady more worthy of her than my embarassed situation could have made me And when I farther experienced the condescending goodness of your whole family all united in my favour I had not a wish but for your Clementina  What a disappointment my Jeronymo was her rejection of me obliged as I was to admire the noble Lady the more for her  motives  of rejecting me  And now my dear friend what is your wishThat I shall set your sister an example How can I Is marriage in my power There is but one woman in the world now your dear Clementina has refused me that I can think worthy of succeeding  her  in my affections tho' there are thousands of whom I am not worthy And ought that Lady to accept of a man whose heart had been another's and that other living and single and still honouring him with so much of her regard as may be thought sufficient to attach a grateful heart and occasion a divided Love Clementina herself is not more truly delicate than this Lady Indeed Jeronymo I am ready when I contemplate my situation on a supposition of making my addresses to her to give up myself as the unworthiest of her favour of all the men I know and she has for an admirer almost every man who sees herEven Olivia admires her Can I do justice to the merits of both and yet not  appear  to be divided by a double LoveFor I will own to all the world my affection for Clementina and as once it was encouraged by her whole family glory in it  You see my Jeronymo how I am circumstanced The example I fear must come from Italy not from England Yet say I not this for punctiliosake It is not in my  power  to set it as it is in your Clementina's It would be presumption to suppose it is Clementina has not an aversion to the  state  She  cannot to the man you have in view since prepossession in favour of another is overThis is a hard push upon me I presume not to say what Clementina  will  what she  can  do But she is naturally the most dutiful of children and has a high sense of the more than common obligations she owes to parents to brothers to whom she has as unhappily as involuntarily given great distress Difference in Religion the motive of her rejecting  me  is not in the question Filial duty is an article of Religion  I do myself the honour of writing to the Marchioness to the General to Father Marescotti and to Mr Lowther May the Almighty perfect your recovery my Jeronymo and preserve in health and spirits the dear Clementinaand may every other laudable wish of the hearts of a family so trulyexcellent be granted to themprays my dearest Jeronymo the friend who expects to see you in England the friend who loves you as he loves his own heart and equally honours all of your name and  will  so long as he is  CHARLES GRANDISON  LETTER VI  Mrs  REEVES  To Miss  BYRON  Tuesday Sept    O My dear cousin I am now sure you will be the happiest of women Sir Charles Grandison made us a visit this very dayHow Mr Reeves and I rejoiced to see him We had but just before been called upon by a line from Lady G to rejoice with her on her brother's happy arrival He said he was under obligation to go to Windsor and Hampshire upon extraordinary occasions but he could not go till he had paid his respects to us as well for our own sakes as to enquire after your health He had received  he said some disagreeable inimitations in relation to it We told him you were not well but we hoped not dangerously ill He said so many kind tender yet respectful things of youO my Harriet I am sure and so is Mr Reeves he loves you dearly Yet we both wondered that he did not talk of paying you a visit But he may have great matters in handBut what matters can be so great as not to be postponed if he loves youand that he certainly does I should not have known how to contain my joy before him had he declared himself your Lover  He condescendingly asked to see my little boyWas not that very good of him He would have won my heart by this condescension had he not had a great share of it beforeFor your sake my cousin You know I cannot mean otherwise And you know that except Mr Reeves and my little boy I love my Harriet better than anybody in the world Nobody in Northamptonshire I am sure will take exceptions at this  I thought I would write to you of this kind visit Be well now my dear All things I am sure will come abou for good God grant they mayI dare say he will visit you in Northamptonshire And if he does what can be his motive  Not  mere friendship Sir Charles Grandison is no trisler  I know you will be sorry to hear that Lady Betty Williams is in great affliction Miss Williams has run away with ensign who is not worth a shilling He is on the contrary  over head and cars  as the saying is in debt Such a mere girl But what shall we say  Miss Cantillon has made as foolish a step Lord bless me I think girls in these days are bewitched A nominal captain too Her mother vows they shall both starve for her And they have no other dependence She can't live without her pleasures Neither can he without his A Ranelagh sop Poor wretches  What will become of them For everything is in her mother's power as to fortuneShe has been met by Miss Allestree and looked  so  shy  so  silly  so  slatternly Unhappy coquettish thing  Well but God bless you my dearMy nursery calls upon me The dear little soul is so  fond  of me Adieu Compliments to everybody I have so much reason to love Mr Reeves's too Once more Adieu  ELIZA REEVES  LETTER VII  Miss  BYRON  To Mrs  REEVES  Selbyhouse  Friday Sept    YOUR kind Letter my dear cousin has at the same time delighted and pained me I rejoyce in the declared esteem of one of the best of men and I honour him for his friendly love expressed to you and my cousin in the visit he made you But I am pained at your calling upon me in pity to my weakness shall I call it a weakness so ill concealed to rejoice that the excellent man when he has dispatched all his affairs of consequence and has nothing elso to do may  possibly  for you cannot be certain make me a visit in NorthamptonshireO my cousin And were his absence and the apprehension of his being the husband of another woman think you the  occasion  of my indisposition that I must now that the other affair seems determined in a manner so unexpected be bid at once to be well  Sir Charles Grandison my dear cousin may honour us with the  prognosticated  visit or not as he pleases But were he to declare himself my Lover my heart would not be so joyful as you seem to expect if Lady Clementina is to be unhappy What tho' the refusal of marriage was hers was not that refusal  the greatest sacrifice that ever woman made to her superior duty Does she not still avow her Love to him And  must  he not  ought  he not ever to love her And here my pride puts in it's claim to attentionShall your Harriet sit down and think herself happy in a secondplace Love Yet let me own to you my cousin that Sir Charles Grandison is dearer to me than all else that I hold most dear in this world And if Clementina could be not  un  happy Happy I have no notion she can be without him and he were to declare himself my Lover Affectation be gone I would say I will trust to my own heart and to my future conduct to make for myself an interest in his affections that should enrich my content in other words that should make me  more  than contented  But time will soon determine my destiny I will have patience to wait its determination I make no doubt but he has sufficient reasons for all he does  I am as much delighted as you could be at the notice he took of your dear infant The brave must be humane And what greater instance of humanity can be shewn than for grown persons to look back upon the state they were once themselves in with tenderness and compassion  I am very sorry for the cause of Lady Betty's affliction Pity the good Lady took notBut I will not be severe after I have said that children's faults are not always  originally  their own  Poor Miss CantillonBut she was not under age and  as  her punishment was of her own choosingI am sorry however for both I hope after they have smarted something will be done for the poor wretches Good parents  will be  placable bad ones or such as have not given good examples  ought to be  so  God continue to you my dear cousins both your present comforts and increase your pleasures for all your pleasures are innocent ones prays  Your ever obliged and affectionate▪ HARRIET BYRON  LETTER VIII  Miss  BYRON  To Lady  G  Selbyhouse  Wedn Sept    My dearest Lady  G  DO you know what is become of your brother My grandmamma Shirely has seen his Ghost and talked with it near an hour and then it vanished Be not surprized my dear creature I am still in amaze at the account my grandmamma gives us of its appearance discourse and vanishing Nor was the dear parent in a resverie It happened in the middle of the afternoon all in broad day Thus she tells it  'I was sitting said she in my own drawingroom yesterday by myself when in came James to whom it first appeared and told me that a gentleman desired to be introduced to me I was reading  Sherlock upon Death  with that chearfulness with which I always meditate the subject I gave orders for his admittance and in came to appearance one of the handsomest men I ever saw in my life in a ridingdress It was a courteous Ghost It saluted me or at least I thought it did For it answering to the description that you my Harriet had given me of that amiable man I was surprised But contrary to the manner of ghosts it spoke firstVenerable Lady it called me and said its name was Grandison in a voiceso like what I had heard you spake of it that I had no doubt but it was Sir Charles Grandison himself and was ready to fall down to welcome him  'It took its place by me You madam said it will forgive this intrusion And it made several fine speeches with an air  so  modest  so  manlyIt had almost all the talk to itself I could only bow and  be pleased for still I thought it was corporally and indeed Sir Charles Grandison It said that it had but a very little while to stay It must reach I don't know what place that nightWhat said I will you not go to Selbyhouse Will you not see my daughter Byron Will you not see her aunt Selby No it desired to be excused It talked of leaving a pacquet behind it and seemed to pull out of its pocket a parcel of Letters sealed up It broke the seal and laid the parcel on the table before me It refused refreshment It desired in a courtly manner an answer to what it had discoursed uponMade a profound reverenceandvanished'  And now my dear Lady G let me repeat my question What is become of your brother  Forgive me this light this amusing manner My grandmamma speaks of this visit as an appearance so sudden and so short and nobody seeing him but she that it gave a kind of amusing levity to my pen and I could not resist the temptation I was under to surprise you as he has done us all How could he take such a journey see nobody but my grandmamma and fly the country Did he do it to spare us or to spare himself  The direct truth is this My grandmamma was sitting by herself as above James told her as above that a gentleman desired to be introduced to her He  was  introduced He called himself by his own name took her hand saluted herYour character madam and mine said he are so well known to each other that tho' I never before had the honour of approaching you I may presume upon your pardon for this intrusion  He then launched out in the praises of your happy friend With what delight did the dear the indulgent parent repeat them from his mouth I hope she mingled not her own partialities with them whether I deserved them or not for sweet is praise from  those we wish to love us And then he said You see before you madam a man glorying in his affection to one of the most excellent of your Sex an Italian Lady the pride of Italy And who from motives which cannot be withstood has rejected him at the very time that all her friends consenting and innumerable difficulties overcome he expected that she would yield her hand to his wishesAnd they  were  his wishes My  friendship  for the dear Miss Byron  You  and  she  must  authorize  me to call it by a still dearer name before I dare to it is well known That also has been my pride I know too well what belongs to female delicacy in general and particularly to that of Miss Byron to address myself first to her on the subject which occasions you this trouble I am not accustomed to make professions not even to LadiesIs it consistent with your notions of delicacy madam Will it be with Mr and Mrs Selby's to give your interest in favour of a man who is thus situated A rejected man A man who dares to own that the rejection was a disappointment to him and that he tenderly loved the fair rejecter If it will and Miss Byron can accept the tender of a heart that has been divided unaccountably so the circumstances I presume you know then will  you  then will  she  lay me under an obligation that I can only  endeavour  to repay by the utmost gratitude and affectionBut if not I shall admire the delicacy of the  second  refuser as I do the piety of the  first  and at  least suspend  all thoughts of a change of condition  Noblest of menAnd my grandmamma was proceeding in high strains but very sincere ones when interrupting her and pulling out of his pocket the pacquet I mentioned above I presume madam said he that I see favour and goodness to me in your benign countenance But I will not even be  favoured  but upon your full knowledge of all the facts I am master of myself I will be the guardian of the delicacy  of Miss Byron and all her friends in this important case rather than the discourager tho' I were to suffer by it You will be so good as to read these Letters to your daughter Byron to her Lucy to Mr and Mrs Selby and to whom else you will think fit to call to the consultation They will be those I presume who already know something of the history of the excellent Clementina If on the perusal of them I may be admitted to pay my respects to Miss Byron consistently as I hinted with  her  notions and  yours  of that delicacy by which she was always directed and at the same time be received with that noble frankness which has distinguished her in my eye above all women but one Excuse me madam I must always put these sistersouls upon an equal foot of excellence then shall I be a happier man than the happiest Your answer madam by pen and ink will greatly oblige me and the more the sooner I can be favoured with it because being requested by my friends abroad to set an example to their beloved Clementina as you will see in more than one of these Letters I would avoid all punctilio and let them know that I had offered myself to Miss Byron and have not been mortified with absolute denial if I may be so happy as to be allowed to write so  Thus did this most generous of men prevent by this reference to the Letters my grandmamma's heart overflowing to her lips He should directly he said proceed on his journey to London and was in such haste to be gone when he had said what he had to say that it precipitated a little my grandmamma's spirits But the joy she was filled with on the occasion was so great that she only had a concern upon her when he was gone as if something was left by her undone or unsaid which she thought should have been said and done to oblige him  The Letters he left on the table were copies of what he wrote from Lyons to the Marquis and Marchioness  the Bishop the General and Father Marescotti as also to Lady Ciementina and her brother the good Jeronymo  These Letters are omitted in this collection  That to the Lady cannot be enough admired for the tenderness yet for the acquiescence with her will expressed in it Surely they were born for each other however it happens that they are not likely to come together  A Letter from Signor Jeronymo in answer to his from Lyons I will mention next In thisSir Charles is wished to use his supposed influence upon Lady Clementina What a hard task upon him to dissuade her from the thoughts of going into a nunnery and to resolve upon marriage  See Letter ii    Next is a Letter of Lady Clementina to Sir Charles complaining tenderly of persecution from her friends who press her to marry while she contends to be allowed to take the veil and applies to Sir Charles for his interest in her behalf  The next is Sir Charles's reply to Lady Clementina  Then follows a Letter from Sir Charles to Signor Jeronymo I have copied these three last and inclose them in confidence  See Letters iii iv v    By these you will see my dear that the affair between this excellent man and woman is entirely given up by both and also in his reply to Signor Jeronymo that your Harriet is referred to as his next choice And how can I ever enough value him for the dignity he has given me in putting it as it should seem in my power to lay an obligation upon him in making for me my own scruples and now lastly in the method he has taken in the application to my grandmamma instead of to me and leaving all to our determination But thus should the men give dignity even for their own saken to the women whom they wish to be theirs Were there more Sir Charles Grandisons would not even the Female world  much better as I hope it is than the Male be amended  My grandmamma the moment Sir Charles was gone sent to us that she had some very agreeable news to surprise us with and therefore desired the whole family of us her Byron particularly to attend her at Breakfast the next morning We looked upon one another at the message and wondered I was not well and would have excused myself but my aunt insisted upon my going Little did I or anybody else think of your brother having visited my grandmamma in person When she acquainted us that he had my weakened spirits wanted support I was obliged to withdraw with Lucy  I thought I could not bear when I recovered myself that he should be so near and not  once  call in and enquire after the health of the creature for whom he professed so high an esteem and even affection But when on my return to company my grandmamma related what passed between them and the Letters were read then again were my failing spirits unable to support me They all gazed upon me as the Letters were reading as well as while my grandmamma was giving the relation of what he said and of the noble the manly air with which he delivered himselfWith joy and silent congratulation they gazed upon me while I felt such a variety of sensibilities in my heart as I never felt before sensibilities mixed with wonder and I was sometimes ready to doubt whether I were not in a resverie whether indeed I was in this world or another whether I was Harriet ByronI know not how to describe what I felt in my now fluttering now rejoicing now dejected heart  DejectedYes my dear Lady G Dejection was a strong ingredient in my sensibilities I know not why Yet may there not be a fulness in joy that will mingle dissatisfaction with it If there may shall I  be excused for my solemnity if I deduce from thence an argument that the human soul is not to be fully satisfied by worldly enjoyments and that therefore the completion of its happiness must be in another a more perfect state You Lady G are a very good woman tho' a lively one and I will not excuse  you  if on an occasion that bids me look forward to a very solemn event you will not forgive my  seriousnes  That  bids me look forward  I repeat for Sir Charles Grandison cannot alter his mind The world has not wherewith to  tempt  him to alter it after he has made  such  advances except I misbehave  Well my dear and what was the result of our conferenceMy grandmamma my aunt and Lucy were of opinion that I ought no more to revolve the notions of a divided or secondplaced Love That every point of female delicacy was answered That he ought not only  still  to be allowed to love Lady Clementina but that I and all her Sex should revere her That my grandmamma being the person applied to should answer for me for us all in words of her own choosing  I was silent What think  you  my dear said my aunt with her accustomed tenderness  Think said my uncle with his usual facetiousness Do you think if Harriet had  one  objection she would have been silent I am for sending up for Sir Charles out of hand Let him come the first day of next week and let them be married before the end of it  Not  quite  so hasty neither Mr Selby said my grandmamma smiling Let us send to Mr Deane His love for my child and regard for deserve the most grateful returns  What a duce and defer an answer to Sir Charles who gives a generous reason for the sake of the Lady abroad and her family and I hope he thinks a little of his  own  sake for wishing a speedy answer  No Mr Selby Not deser writing neither We  know enough of Mr Deane's mind already But for my part I don't know what terms what conditions what additions to my child's fortune to propose  Additions madamWhy ay there must be some to be sureAnd we are able and as willing as able let me tell you to make them  I beseech you Sir said IPray madamNo more of thisSurely it is time enough to talk of these subjects  So it is niece Mr Deane is a lawyer God help me I never was brought up to anything but to live on the fat of the land as the saying is Mr Deane and Sir Charles shall talk this matter over by themselves Let us as you say send for Mr Deane But I will myself be the messenger of these joyful tidings  My uncle then tuned out in his gay manner a line of an old song and then said I'll go to Mr Deane I will set out this very dayPull down the wall as one of our kings said the door is too far aboutI'll bring Mr Deane with me tomorrow or it shall cost me a fall  You know my uncle my dear In this manner did he express his joy  My grandmother retired to her closet and this that follows is what she wrote to Sir Charles Everybody is pleased whenever she takes up the pen No one made objection to a single word in it  Dear Sir  REserve would be unpardonable on our side tho' the woman's to a man who is above reserve and whose offers are the result of deliberation and an affection that being founded in the merit of our dearest child cannot be doubted We all receive as an honour the offer you make us of an alliance which would do credit to families of the first rank It will perhaps be one day owned to you that it was the height of Mr Selby's wishes and mine that the man  who had rescued the dear createre from insult and distress might be at liberty to intitle himself to her grateful Love  The noble manner in which you have explained yourself on a subject which has greatly embarrassed you has abundantly satisfied Mrs Selby Lucy and myself We can have no scruples of delicacy Nor am I afraid of suffering from yours by my frankness But as to our HarrietYou may perhaps meet with some not affectation she is a ove it difficulty with  her  if you expect her  whole  heart to be yours She Sir experimentally knows how to allow for a double a divided LoveDr Bartlett perhaps should not have favoured her with the character of a Lady whom she prefers to herself and Mrs Selby and I have sometimes as we read her melancholy story thought not unjustly If she can be induced to love to honour the man of her choice as much as she loves honours and admires Lady Clementina the happy Man will have reason to be satisfied You see Sir that we who were able to give a preference to the same Lady against ourselves Harriet Byron  is  ourself can have no scruples on  your  giving it to the same incomparable woman May that Lady be happy If she were  not  to be so and her unhappiness were to be owing to our happiness that dear Sir would be all that could pain the hearts of any of us on an occasion so very agreeable to  Your sincere Friend and Servant HENRIETTA SHIRLEY  But my dear Lady G does your brother tell you and Lady L nothing of his intentions Why if he does do not youBut I  can  have no doubt Is not the man Sir Charles Grandison And yet methinks I want to know what the contents of his next Letters from Italy will be  You will have no scruple my dear Lady G to  shew my whole Letter to Lady L and if you please to my EmilyBut only mention the contents in your own way to the gentlemen I beg you will yourself shew it to Mrs Reeves She will rejoice in her  prognostigations  Use that word to her She will understand you Your brother must now less than ever see what I write I depend upon your discretion my dear Lady G  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER IX  Lady  G  To Miss  BYRON  Wedn Sept    EXcellent Mrs Shirley Incomparable woman How I love her If I were such an excellent ancient I would no more wish to be young than she has so often told us she does What my brother once said and you once wrote to your Lucy is true in  her  case at least that the matronly and advanced time of life in a woman is far from being the  least  elegible part of it especially I may add when health and a good conscience accompany it What a spirit does she at her time of Life write withBut her heart is in her subjectI hope I may say  that  Harriet without offending you  Not a word did my brother speak of his intention till he received that Letter and then he invited Lady L and me and our two honest men to afternoon tea with himO but I have not reckoned with you for your saucy rebukes in your last of the th I owe you a spite for it and Harriet depend on paymentWhat was I writingI have it And when tea was over he without a blush without looking down as a girl would do in this situationBut why so Harriet Is a woman on these occasions to act a part as if she supposed herself to be the greatest gainer by  matrimony and therefore was ashamed of consenting to accept of an honourable offer As if in other words she was to be the selfdenying receiver rather than conferrer of an obligationLord how we ramblingheaded creatures break in upon ourselves with a good grace he told us of his intention to marry of his apparition to Mrs Shirley of his sudden vanishing and all thatAnd then he produced Mrs Shirley's Letter but just received  And do you think we were not overjoyedIndeed we were We congratulated him We congratulated each other Lord L looked as he did when Caroline gave him his happy day Lord G could not keep his seat He was tipsy poor man with his joy Aunt Nell prank'd herself stroked her ribbands of pink and yellow and chuckled and mumped for joy that her nephew at last would not go out of Old England for a wife She was  mightily  pleased too with Mrs Shirley's Letter It was just such a one as she herself would have written upon the occasion  I posted afterward to Mrs Reeves to shew her as you requested your Letter And when we had read it there was Dear Madam and Dear Sir and now this and now that and Thank Godthree times in a breath and we were cousins and cousins and cousins And O blessed And O be joyful AndHail the dayAnd God grant it to be a short oneAnd How will Harriet answer to the question Will not her frankness be try'd He despises affectation So he thinks does sheGood Sirs and O dearsHow things are brought aboutO my Harriet you never heard or saw such congratulations between three gossips as were between our two cousin Reeves's and me And not a little did the good woman pride herself in her  prognostics  for she explained that matter to me  Dr Bartlett is at Grandisonhall with our unhappy cousin How will the good man rejoice  Now you will ask What became of Emily  By the way do you know that Mrs OHara is turned  Methodist  True as you are alive And she labours hard to convert her husband Thank God she is anything that is serious Those People have really great merit with me in  her  conversionI am sorry that our own Clergy are not as zealously in earnest as they They have really my dear if we may believe aunt Eleanor given a face of religion to subterranean colliers tinners and the most profligate of men who hardly ever before heard either of the word or thing But  I  am not turning  Methodist  Harriet No you will not suspect me  Now Emily who is at present my visiter had asked leave before my brother's invitation and was gone my Jenny attending her to visit her mother who is not well My brother was engaged to sup abroad with some of the Danby's I believe I therefore made Lord and Lady L cousin Reeves and cousin Reeves and my aunt Grandison sup with me  Emily was at home before meAh the poor EmilyI'll tell you how it was between us  My lovely girl my dear Emily said I I have good news to tell you about Miss Byron  O thank GodAnd is she well Pray madam tell me tell me I long to hear good news of my dear Miss Byron  Why she will shortly be married Emily  Married madam  Yes my loveAnd to your guardian child  To my guardian madamWell but I hope so  I then gave her a few particulars  The dear girl tried to be joyful and burst into tears  Why weeps my girlO fie Are you sorry that Miss Byron will have your guardian I thought you loved Miss Byron  So I do madam as my own self and more than myself if possibleBut the surprize madamIndeed I am glad What makes me such a foolIndeed I am gladWhat ails me to cry I wonder It is what I wished what I prayed for night and day Dear madam don't tell anybody I am ashamed of myself  The sweet Aprilfaced girl then smiled through her tears  I was charmed with her innocent sensibility and if you are not I shall think less of you than ever I did yet  Dear madam said she permit me to withdraw for a few minutes I must have my cry outAnd I shall then be all joy and gladness  She tript away and in half an hour came down to me with quite another face  Lady L was then with me I had told her of the girl's emotion We are equally lovers of you my dear said I you need not be afraid of Lady L  And have you told madamWell but I am not a hypocrite What a strange thing I who have always been so much afraid of another Lady for Miss Byron's sake to be so oddly affected as if I were sorryIndeed I rejoiceBut if you tell Miss Byron she won't love me She won't let me live with her and my guardian when she is happy and has made him so And what shall I do then for I have set my heart upon it  Miss Byron my dear loves you so well that she will not be able to deny you anything your heart is set upon that is in her power to grant  God bless Miss Byron as I love her and she will be the happiest of womenBut what was the matter with meYet I believe I knowMy poor mother had been crying sadly to me for her past unhappy life She kissed me as she said for my  Father's  sake She had been the worst of wives to the best of husbands  Again the good girl wept at her mother's remembered remorseMy guarmy guardian's goodness my mother said had awakened her to a sense of her wickedness My poor mother did not spare herself And I was all sorrow for what could I say to her on such a subjectAnd all the way that I came home in the coach I did nothing but cry I had but just dried my eyes and tried to look chearful when you came in And then when you told me the good news something struck me all at once struck my very heart I cannot account for it I know not what to liken it toAnd had I not burst into tears I believe it would have been worse for me But now I am myself and if my poor mother could pacify her conscience I should be a happy creature  because  of Miss Byron's happiness You look at each other Ladies But if you think I should  not  bid me be gone from your presence for a false girl and never see you more  Now Harriet this emotion of Emily appears to me as a sort of phaenomenon Do  you  account for it as you will but I am sure Emily is no hypocrite She has no art She  believes  what she says that her sudden burst of tears was owing to her heart being affected by her mother's contrition And I am also sure that she loves you above all the women in the world Yet it is possible that the subtle thief ycleped Love had got very near her heart and just at the moment threw a dart into one angle of it which was the  something  that struck her all at once as she phrased it and made her find tears a relief This I know my dear that we may be very differently affected by the same event when judged of at a distance and near If you don't already or if you soon will not experience the truth of this observation in the great event before you I am much mistaken  But you see Harriet what joy this happy declaration of my brother and the kind reception it has met with from Northamptonshire has given us all We will keep your secret never fear till all is over and when it is you shall let my brother know from the Letters we have had the favour of seeing as much as  we  do Till he does excellent as he thinks you he will not know one half of your excellencies nor the merit which your Love and your Suspenses have made you with him  But with you I long for the arrival of the next Letters from Italy God grant that Lady Clementina hold her resolution now that she sees it is almost impossible for her to avoid marrying If she should relent what would be the consequence to my brother to herself to you And how shall all we his friends and yours be affected You think the Lady is obliged in duty to her parents to marry Lady L and I are determined to be wise and not give our opinions till the events which are yet in the bosom of Fate disclosing themselves shall not leave us a possibility of being much mistaken And yet as to what the filial duty requires of her we think she ought to marry Mean time I repeat  'God grant that Lady Clementina now hold her mind'  LADY L sends up her name Formality in  her  surely I will chide her But here she comesI love Harriet to write to the moment that's a knack I had from you and my brother And be sure continue it on every occasion No  pathetic  without it  Your servant Lady L  And your servant Lady GWriting To whom  To our Harriet  I will read your LetterShall I  Take it but read it out that I may know what I have written  Now give it me again I'll write down what you say to it Lady L  Lady L  I say you are a whimsical creature But I don't like what you have  last  written  Charlotte Last written  'Tis downBut why so Lady L  Lady L  How can you thus teaze our beloved Byron with your conjectural evils  Ch  Have I supposed an impossibilityBut 'tis down  Conjectural evils  Lady L  If you are so whimsical write  'My dear Miss Byron'  Ch  My dear Miss Byron  'Tis down  Lady L  Looking over me  'Do not let what this strange Charlotte has written grieve

nothing of this that I have so sagely apprehended may happen for I desire not to be dubbed a witch so much at my own as well as at your expence I will also subscribe that of  Your no less affectionate Sister Friend and Servant CHARLOTTE G  My brother says he has sent you a Letter and your grandmamma anotherFull of grateful sensibilities both I make no questionBut no Flight or Goddessmaking absurdity I dare say You will give us copies  if you are as obliging  as  you used to be  LETTER X  Miss  BYRON  To Lady  G  Monday Sept    WHAT have I done to my Charlotte Is there not something cold and particular in your stile especially in that part of your Letter preceding the entrance of my good Lady L And in your Postscript  You will give us copies if you are as obliging as you used to be  Why should I when likely to be more obliged to you than ever be less obliging than before I can't bear this from Lady G Are you giving me a proof of the truth of your own observation  'That we may be very differently affected by the same event when judged of at a distance and near'  I could not support my spirits if the sister of Sir Charles Grandison loved me the less for the distinction her brother pays me  And what my dear if Lady Clementina  should  RELENT as you phrase it My  friends  might be now grievedWell and I might be affected too more than if the visit to my grandmamma had not been made I own itBut the high veneration I truly profess to have for Lady Clementina would be parade and pretension if whatever became of your Harriet I did not resolve in that case to  try  at least to make myself easy and give up to her prior and worthier claim And I should consider her  effort  tho' unsuccessful as having intitled her to my highest esteem To what we know to be right we ought to submit the more difficult the more meritorious And in this case your Harriet would conquer or die If she conquered she would then in  that  instance be greater than even Clementina O my dear we know not till we have the trial what emulation will enable a warm and honest mind to do  I will send you inclosed copies of the two Letters transcribed by Lucy  These Letters do not appear The contents may be gathered from what she here says of them  I am very proud of them both perhaps too proud and it may be necessary that I should be pulled down tho' I expected it not from my Charlotte  'To be complimented in so noble and sincere a manner as you will see I am with the power of laying an obligation on him'  instead of owing it to his compassionate consideration for a creature so long labouring in suspense and then despairing that her hopes could be answered is enough at the same time to flatter her vanity and gratify the most delicate sensibility  You will see  'how gratefully he takes my grandmamma's hint that I knew how by experience to account for a double a  divided  Love as she is pleased to call itand the preference my aunt and herself and I have given to the claim of Lady Clementina'  You my dear know our sincerity in this particular There is some merit in owning a truth when it makes against us To do justice in another's case against one's self is methinks making at least a  second  merit for one's self  'He asks my leave to attend me at Selbyhouse'  I should rejoice to see himBut I could wish methinks that he had first received Letters from abroad But how can I hint my wishes to him without implying either doubt or reserve  Reserve  in the delay of his visit implied by such hint  doubt  of his being at liberty to pursue his intentions That would not become me to shew as it might make him think that I wanted protestations and assurances from him in order to  bind  him to me when if the situation be such as obliges him to balance but in  thought  and I could know it I would die before I would accept of his hand He has confirmed and established as I may say my pride I had always some by the distinction he has given  me Yet I should despise myself if I found it gave me either arrogance or affectation  'He is so considerate as to despense with my answering his Letters'  for he is pleased to say  'That if I do not  forbid  him to come down by my aunt Selby or my grandmamma he will presume upon my leave'  My uncle set out for Peterborough in order to bring Mr Deane with him to Selbyhouse Poor Mr Deane had kept his chamber for a week before yet had not let us know he was ill He was forbid to go abroad for two days more but was so overjoyed at what my uncle communicated to him that he said he was not sensible of alling anything and he would have come with my uncle next day but neither he nor the doctor would permit it But on Tuesday he cameSuch joyDear good manSuch congratulationHow considerable to their happiness do they all make that of their tootoo much obliged Harriet  They have been in consultation often but they have excluded me from some particular ones I guess the subject and beg of them that I may not be  too much  obliged What critical situations have I been in When will they be at an end  Mr Deane has written to Sir Charles I am not to know the contents of his Letter The hearts of us women when we are urged to give way to a  clandestine  and  unequal  address or when inclined to favour such a one are apt and are pleaded with to rise against the notions of bargain and sale  Smithfield bargains  you Londoners call them But unjust is the odium if preliminaries are necessary in all treaties of this nature And surely previous stipulations are indispensably so among us changeable mortals however promising the sunshine may be at our setting out on the journey of life a journey too that will not be ended but with the life of one of the travellers  If I ever were to be tempted to wish for great  wealth it would be for the sake of Sir Charles Grandison that I might be a means of enlarging his power Since I am convinced that the necessities of every worthy person within the large circle of his acquaintance would be relieved according to his ability  My dear EmilyAh Lady G Was it  possible  for you to think that my pity for the amiable Innocent should not increase my love of her I will give you leave  indeed  to despise me if you ever find anything in my behaviour to Emily let me be circumstanced as I will that shall shew an abatement of that tender affection which ever must warm my heart in her favour Whenever I can promise anything for myself then shall Emily be a partaker of my felicity in the way her own heart shall direct I hope for  her own  sake that the dear girl puts the matter right when she attributes her sudden burst of tears to the weakness of her spirits occasioned by her mother's remorse But let me say one thing It would grieve me as much as it did Sir Charles in the Count of Belvedere's case to stand in the way of anybody's happiness It is not you see your  brother  's fault that he is not the husband of Lady Clementina She wishes him to marry an EnglishwomanNor is even the hope of Lady Olivia frustrated by me You know I always pitied her and that before I knew from Sir Charles's Letter to Signor Jeronymo that she thought kindly of meLady Anne S Do you think my dear that worthy Lady could have hopes were it  not  for meAnd could my Emily have any were I out of the worldNo surely The very  wardship  which he executes with so much indulgent goodness to her would exclude all such hopes considerable enough as his estate is to answer a larger fortune than even Emily's Were hers not half so much as it is it would perhaps be more likely than now that his generous mind might be disposed in her favour some years hence  Let me however tell you that true sisterly pity overwhelmed my heart when I first read that part of your Letter which so pathetically describes her tender woe Be the occasion her Duty or her Love or owing to a mixture of both I am charmed with her beautiful simplicity I wept over that part of your Letter for half an hour for I was by myself and more than once I looked round and round me wishing for the dear creature to be near me and wanting to clasp her to my bosom  Love me still and that as well as ever my dear Lady G or I shall want a great ingredient of happiness in whatever situation I may be I have written to thank my dear Lady L for her goodness to me in dictating to your pen and I thank you my dear for being dictated to I cannot be well Send me but one line ease my overburdened heart of one of its anxieties by telling me that there has nothing passed of littleness in me that has abated your love to  Your evergrateful everaffectionate HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XI  Lady  G  To Miss  BYRON  GrosvenorSquare  Wedn Sept    FLY  Script  of one line on the wings of the wind fly to acquaint my Harriet that I love her above all womenand all  men  too my brother excepted Tell her that I now love her with an increased love because I love her for  his  sake as well as her own  Forgive my dear all the carelessness as you always did the flippancies of my pen The happy prospect that all our wishes would be succeeded to us had given a levity a wantonness to it Wicked penBut I have burnt the whole parcel from which I took  itYet I should correct  myself  for I don't know whether I did not intend to teaze a little I don't know whether my compassion for Emily did not make me more silly If that were so for really I suffered my pen to take its course at the time therefore burnt it I know you will the more readily forgive me  Littleness  Harriet You are all that is great and good in woman The littleness of others adds to your greatness Have not  my  foibles always proved thisNo my dear you are as great asClementina herself And I love you better if possible than I love myself  A few lines more on other subjects for I can't write a short Letter to my Harriet  The Countess of D has made my brother a visit I happened to be at his house They were alone together near an hour At going away he attending her to her chair she took my hand All all my hopes are over said she but I will love Miss Byron for all that Nor shall  you  Sir Charles in the day of your power deny me my correspondent Nor must you madam and Lady L a friendship with Sir Charles Grandison's two sisters  Lady W and my sister and I correspond I want you to know her that you may love her as well as we do Lovematches my dear are foolish things I know not how you will find it some time hence No general rule however without exceptions you know Violent Love on one side is enough in conscience if the other be not a fool

guess to whom  Lady Anne SPoor Lady Anne SI dare not tell my brothet how much she loves him I am sure it would make him uneasy  Beauchamp desires his compliments to you He is in great affliction Poor Sir Harry is thought irrecoverable Different physicians have gone their rounds with him But the new ones only ask what the old ones did that they may  guess  at something else to make trial of When a patient has money it is hard I believe for a physician to be honest and to say till the last extremity That the Parson and Sexton may take him  Adieu my loveAdieu all my grandmammas aunts cousins and kin's kin of NorthamptonshireAdieu  CHARLOTTE G  LETTER XII  Miss  BYRON  To Lady  G  Tuesday Oct    A Thousand thanks to you my dear Lady G for the favour of your last You have reassured me in it I think I could not have been happy even in the affection of Sir Charles Grandison were I to have found an abatement in the Love of his two sisters Who that knows you both and that had been favoured with your friendship could have been satisfied with the least diminution of it  I have a Letter from the Countess of D  This Letter does not appear  She is a most generous woman  'She even congratulates me on your brother's account from the conversation that passed between him and her She gives me the particulars of that conversation Exceedingly flattering are they to my vanity'  I  must  my dear be happy if you continue to love me and if I can know that Lady Clementina is not unhappy This latter is a piece of Intelligence necessary I was going to say for my tranquility For can your brother be happy if that Lady be otherwise whose grievous malady could hold in suspence his generous heart when he had no prospects at the time of ever calling her his  I pity from my heart Lady Anne S What a dreadful thing is hopeless Love the object so worthy that every mouth is full of his praises How many women will your brother's preference of  one  be she who she will disappoint in their first Loves Yet out of a hundred women how few are there who for one reason or other have the man of their choice  I remember you once said It was well that Love is not a passion absolutely invincible But however I do not my dear agree with you in your notions of all Lovematches Love merely  personal  that sort of Love which commences between the year of fifteen and twenty and when the extraordinary  merit  of the object is not the foundation of it may I believe and perhaps  generally  ought to be subdued But Love that is founded on a merit that everybody acknowlegesI don't know what to say to the vincibility of  such  a Love For myself I think it impossible that I ever could have been the wife of any man on earth and given him my affection in so  entire  a manner as should on reflexion have acquitted my own heartTho' I hope I should not have been wanting in my general dutiesAnd why impossible Because I must  have been conscious that there was another man whom I would have preferred to him Let me add that when prospects were darkest with regard to my wishes I promised my grandmamma and aunt to make myself easy at least to endeavour to do so if they never would propose to me the Earl of D or any other man They  did  promise me  Lady D in her Letter to me  'is so good as to claim the continuance of my correspondence'  Most ungrateful and equally selfdenying must I be if I were to decline my part of it  I have a Letter from Sir Rowland Meredith  This Letter appears not  You who have seen his former Letters to me need not be shewn this The same honest heart appears in them all the same kind professions of paternal love You love Sir Rowland and will be pleased to hear that his worthy nephew is likely to recover his health I cannot however be joyful that they are resolved to make me soon one more visit But you will see that Mr Fowler thinks if he could be allowed to visit me once more he should tho' hoping nothing from the visit be easier for the rest of his life A strange way of thinking supposing Love to be his distemper Is it not  I have a Letter from Mr Fenwick He is arrived at his seat near Daventry He has made a very short excursion abroad He tells me in it that he designs me a visit on a particular subject If it be as I suspect to engage my interest with my Lucy he shall  not  have her He is not worthy of her  The friendship and favour of Lady W is one of the great felicities which seem to offer to bless my future lot  Mr Greville is the most persevering as well as most audacious of men As other men endeavour to gain a woman's affections by politeness he makes pride illnature and impetuosity the proofs of his Love  and thinks himself ill used especially since his large acquisition of fortune that they are not accepted as such He has obliged Mr Deane to hear his pleas and presumed to hope for his favour Mr Deane frankly told him that his interest lay quite another way He then insolently threatened with destruction the man be he who he will that shall stand in his way He doubts not he says but Sir Charles Grandison is the man designed But if so  cool  a Lover is to be encouraged against so  servent  a one as himself he is mistaken in all his notions of womens conduct and judgments in Lovematters A  discrect  Lover he says is an unnatural character Women the odious wretch says love to be devoured Is he not an odious wretch and if Miss Byron can content herself with another woman's  leavings  for that he says he is well informed is the case he knows what he shall think of her spirit And then he threw out as usual reflections on our Sex which had malice in them  This man's threats disturb me God grant that your brother may not meet with any more embarrasments from insolent men on my account  If these men this Greville in particular would let me be at peace I should be better I believe in my health But Lady Frampton is his advocate by Letter He watches my footsteps and in every visit I make throws himself in the way And on Sundays he is always ready with his officious hand as I alight to enter the church and to lead me back to my uncle's coach My uncle cannot affront him because he will not be affronted by him He rallies off with an intrepidity that never was exceeded all that my aunt says to him I repulse him with anger everywhere but in a place so public and so sacred He disturbs my devotion with his staring eyes always fixed on our pew which draw every one's after them He has the assurance when he intrudes himself into my company to laugh off my anger telling me  that it is what he has long wished for and that now he is so much used to it that he can live on my frowns and cannot support life without them He plainly tells me that Mr Fenwick's arrival from abroad and another certain person's also are the occasion of his resumed sedulity  Everybody about us in short is interested for or against him He makes me appear coy and ridiculous HeBut no more of this bold man Would to Heaven that some one of those who like such would relieve me from him  Visiters and the post oblige me sooner than I otherwise should to conclude myself my dear Lady G  Ever Yours HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XIII  Mr  DEANE  To Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  Selbyhouse  Tuesday Oct    AN alliance more acceptable were it with a prince could not be proposed than that which Sir Charles Grandison in a manner so worthy of himself has proposed with a family who have thought themselves under obligation to him ever since he delivered the darling of it from the lawless attempts of a savage Libertine I know to whom I write and will own that it has been  my  wish in a most particular manner  As to the surviving part of the family  exclusive  of Miss Byron for I will mention her parents byandby it is in all its branches worthy Indeed Sir your wish of a relation to  them  is not a discredit to your high character As to the young LadyI say nothing of herYet how shall I forbearO Sir believe me she will dignify your choice Her duty  and her inclination through every relation of life were never divided  Excuse me SirNo parent was ever more fond of his child than I have been from her infancy of this my daughter by adoption Hence Sir being consulted on this occasion as my affection I will say for the whole family deserves I take upon me to acquaint you before any further steps are taken what our dear child's fortune will be For it has been always my notion that a young gentleman in such a case should the moment he offers himself if his own proposals are acceptable be spared the  indelicacy  of asking questions as to fortune We know Sir yours is great But as your spirit is princely you ought to have something worthy of your own fortune with a wife But here alas we must fail I doubt at least in hand  Mr Byron was one of the best of men his Lady a most excellent woman There never was a happier pair Both had reason to boast of their ancestry His estate was upwards of Four thousand pounds a year but it was entailed and in failure of male heirs was to descend to a second branch of the family which had made itself the more unworthy of it by settling in a foreign country renouncing as I may say its own Mr Byron died a young man and left his Lady  ensient  but grief for losing him occasioned first her miscarriage and then her death and the estate followed the name Hence be pleased to know that Miss Byron's fortune in her own right is no more than between Thirteen and Fourteen thousand pounds It is chiefly in the funds It has been called  l  but it is not much more than thirteen Her grandmother's jointure is between and  l  a year We none of us wish to see my goddaughter in possession of it She herself least of all Mrs Shirley is called by every one that knows her or speaks of her The ornament of old age Her husband an  excellent man desired her to live always in the mansionhouse and in the hospitable way he had ever kept up if what he left her would support her in it She has been longer spared to the prayers of her friends and to those of the poor than was apprehended for she is but infirm in health She therefore can do but little towards the increase of her child's fortune But Shirleymanor is a fine old seat SirAnd there is timber upon the estate which wants but ten years growth and will be felled to good account Mr Selby is well in the world He proposes as a token of his love to add  l  in hand to his niece's fortune and by his will something very considerable farther expectant on his Lady's death who being Miss Byron's aunt by the father's side intends by her will to do very handsomely for herBy the way my dear Sir be assured that what I write is absolutely unknown to Miss Byron  There  is  a man who loves her as he loves himself This man has laid by a sum of money every year for the advancing her in marriage beginning with the fifth year of her life when it was seen what a hopeful child she was This has been putout at accumulated interest and it amounts in sixteen years or thereabouts to very near  l  This man Sir will make up the eight thousand ten to be paid on the day of marriage And I hope without promising for what this man will do further at his death that you will accept of this Five or Sixandtwenty thousand Pounds as the chearfullest given and bestbestowed money that ever was laid out  Let not these particulars pain you Sir They should not The subject is a necessary one You who ought to give way to the increase of that power which you so nobly use must not be pained at this mention once for all Princes Sir are not above asking money of their people as freegifts on the marriage of their children He that would be greater than a prince  may before he is aware be less than a gentleman Of this ten thousand pounds Eight is Miss Byron's due as she is likely to be so happy with all our consents else it would not For that was the man's  reserved  condition and the sum or the designation of it was till this day only known to himself  As to settlements in return I would have acted the lawyer but the  honest  lawyer with you Sir and made demands of you but Mr and Mrs Selby and Mrs Shirley unanimously declare that you shall not be prescribed to in this case Were you not Sir Charles Grandison was the question I was against leaving it to you for that  very  reason It will be said I to provoke such a man as Sir Charles to do too much Most other men ought to be spurred but  this  must be held in But however I acquiesced and the more easily because I expect that the deeds shall pass through my hands and I will take care that you shall not in order to give a proof of Love where it is not wanted exert an inadequate generosity  These matters I thought it was absolutely necessary to apprize you of You will have the goodness to excuse any imperfections in my manner of writing There are none in my heart when I assure you that no man breathing can more respect you than Sir  Your most faithful and obedient Servant THOMAS DEANE  LETTER XIV  Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  To  THO DEANE  E  To  THO DEANE  Esq  Thursday Oct    YOU know not my dear Mr Deane upon what an unthankful man you would bestow your favours I pretend not to be above complying with the  laudable customs of the world Princes are examples to themselves I have always in things indifferent been willing to take the world as I find it and conform to it  To say Miss Byron is a treasure in herself is what every man would say who has the honour to know her Yet I would not in a vain ostentation as the interest of a man and his wife is one make a compliment to my affection by resigning or giving from her her natural right especially as there is no one of her family that wants to be benefited by such gifts or resignations But then I will not allow that any of her friends shall part with what is theirs to supplyWhat A  supposed  deficiency in her fortune And by  whom  as implied by you supposed a deficiencyBy me and it is left to me to  confirm  the imputation by my acceptance of the addition so generously as to the  intention  offered Had I incumbrances on my estate which undischarged would involve in difficulties the woman I love I know not what for  her  sake I might be tempted to do But avarice only can induce a man who wants it not to accept of the bounty of a Lady's friends in their lifetime especiallyWhen those friends are not either father or mother one of them not a relation by blood tho' he is by a nearer tye that of Love And it is not the fortune which the Lady possesses in her own right an ample one  I am as rich as I wish to be my dear Mr Deane Were my income less I would live within it were it more it would increase my duties Permit me my good Sir to ask Has the MAN as you call him and a MAN indeed he appears to me to be who intends to make so noble a present to a stranger no relations no friends who would have reason to think themselves unkindly treated if he gave from them such a large portion of his fortune  I would not be thought romantic neither aim I at  ostentation I would be as glad to  follow  as to  set  a good example Can I have a nobler if Miss Byron honours me with her hand than she in  that  case will give in preferring me to the Earl of D a worthy man with a much more splendid fortune than mine Believe me my dear Mr Deane it would on an event so happy be a restraint to my own joy before friends so kindly contributing to the increase of her fortune lest they should imagine that their generosity on the occasion was one of the motives of my gratitude to her for her goodness to me  You tell me that Miss Byron knows nothing of your proposals I beseech you let her  not  know anything of them Abase not so much in her eye the man who presumes on her favour for the happiness of the rest of his life by supposing  Your  supposition Sir may have weight with  her  he could value her the more for such an addition to her fortune No Sir Let Miss Byron satisfied with the consciousness of a worth which all the world acknowleges in one of the most solemn events of her life look round among her congratulating friends with that modest confidence which the sense of laying a high obligation on a favoured object gives to diffident merit and which the receiving of favours from all her friends as if to supply a supposed defective worth must either abate or if it do not make her think less of the interested man who could submit to owe such obligations  If these friendly expostulations conclude against the offer of your  generous friend  they equally do so against that of Mr Selby Were that Gentleman and his Lady the  parents  of Miss Byron the case would be different But Miss Byron's fortune is an  ascertained  one and Mr Selby has relations who stand in an equal degree of consanguinity to him and who are all intitled by their worthiness to his favour My best respects and thanks are however due and I beg you  will make my acknowledgments accordingly as well to your  worthy friend  as to Mr Selby  I take the liberty to send you down the rentroll of my English estate Determine for me as you please my dearest Mr Deane Only take this cautionAffront me not a second time but let the settlements be such as may be fully answerable to my fortune altho' in the common methods of calculation it may exceed that of the dear Lady That you may be the better judge of this you will find a brief particular of my Irish Estate subjoined to the other  I was intending when I received yours to do myself the honour of a visit to Selbyhouse I am impatient to throw myself at the feet of my dear Miss Byron and to commend myself to the favour of Mr and Mrs Selby and every one of a family I am prepared by their characters as well as by their relation to Miss Byron to revere and love But as you seem to choose that the requisite preliminaries should be first adjusted by pen and ink I submit tho' with reluctance to that course but with the less as I may in the interim receive Letters from abroad which tho' they can now make no alteration with regard to the treaty so happily begun may give me an opportunity of laying the whole state of my affairs before Miss Byron by which means she will be enabled to form a judgment of them and of the heart of dear Sir  Her and your most affectionate obliged and faithful humble Servant CH GRANDISON  LETTER XV  Miss  BYRON  To Lady  G  With the two preceding Letters  Selbyhouse  Sat Oct    WELL did you observe my dear that we may be very differently affected by the same event when judged of at a distance and near May I in the present situation presume to say  near  Mr Deane has entered into the particulars of my fortune with Sir Charles The Letter was not shewn me before it went and I was not permitted to see the copy of it till your brother's answer came and then they shewed me both  O my dear Mr Deane my everkind uncle and aunt Selby Was not your Harriet Byron too much obliged to you beforeAs to your brother What my love shall I do with my  pride  I did not know I had so much of that bad quality My poverty my dear has added to my pride Were my fortune superior to that of your brother I am sure I should not be so proud as I now on this occasion find I am How generously does he decline accepting the goodness that was offered to give me more consideration with him as kindly intended by them What can I say to him but that his heart still prouder than my own and more generous than that of any other person breathing will not permit me to owe uncommon obligations to any but himself  He desires that I may not know anything of this transaction But they thought the communication would give me pleasure However they wish me not to take notice to him when he visits Selbyhouse that they have communicated it to me If I did I should think myself obliged to manifest a gratitude that would embarrass me in my present situation and  seem to fetter the freedom of my will Millions of obligations should not bribe me to give up even a corner of my heart to a man to whom I could not give the whole Your brother my dear is in possession of the whole  You know that I hate affectation But must I not have great abatements in my prospects of happiness because of Lady Clementina And must they not be still greater should she be unhappy should she repent of the resolution she so nobly took for his saying that whatever be the contents of his next Letters from Italy they can make no alteration with regard to the treaty begun with usDear dear Clementina most excellent of women Can I bear to stand in the way of your happinessI cannot  My  life any more than yours may not be a long one and I will not fully the whiteness of it Pardon my vanity I presume to call it so on retrospecting it regarding my  intentions  only by giving way to an act of injustice tho' it were to obtain for me the whole heart of the man I love  Yet think you my dear that I am not mortified  'How can I look round upon my congratulating friends in one of the most solemn events of my life with that modest confidence which the sense of laying an obligation on a favoured object'  You know in whose generous words I express myself  'gives to diffident merit'  O my Charlotte I am  afraid  of your brother How shall I look up to him when I next see himBut I will give way to this new guest my  pride  What other way have IWill you forgive me if I try to look upon your brother's generosity to me and my friends in declining so greatly their offers as a bribe to make me sit down satisfied with half nay  not  half a heartAnd now will you not say that I am proud indeed But his is the most delicate of human minds And shall not the woman pretend to some delicacy who has looked up to him  I thought of writing but a few lines in the cover of the two Letters I hope I should not incur displeasure from anybody here were they to know I send them to you for your perusal But let only Lord G your other Self and Lord and Lady L read them and return them by the next post I know you four will pity the poor and proud girl who is so inexpressibly obliged almost to every one she knows but who believe her proud as she is never will be ashamed to own her obligations to you and to Lady L  Witness  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XVI  Lady  G  To Miss  BYRON  GrosvenorSquare  Tuesday Oct    I Return your two Letters Very good ones both I like them Lord L and Lord G thank you for allowing them to peruse them We will know nothing of the matter My brother will soon be with you I believe I wish Dr Bartlet were in town One should then know something of the motions of my brotherNot that he is reserved neither But he is so much engaged that I go four times to St James'sSquare and perhaps do not see him once My Lord had the assurance to say but yesterday that I was there more than at home He is very impertinent I believe he has taken up my sauciness I laid it down and thought to resume it occasionally but when I came to look for it behold it was goneBut I hope if he has it not it is only mislaid I intend if it come not soon to hand to set the parishcrier to proclaim the loss with a reward for the finder It might be the ruin of some indiscreet woman should such a one meet with it and try to use it Aunt Eleanor There I remember myself No more aunt  Nell is as joyful to think her nephew will soon be married and to an  English  woman as if she were going to be married herself Were there to be a wedding in the family or among her acquaintance once a year what with preparation what with solemnization good old soul she would live for ever Chide again Harriet I value it not Yet in your last chiding you were excessively grave But I forgive you Be good and write me everything how and about it and write to the moment You cannot be too minute  I want you to see Lady Olivia's presents They are princely I want to see a Letter she wrote to my brother He mentioned it as something extraordinary When you are his you must shew me all he writes that you are permitted to have in your power long enough to transcribe He and she correspond Do you like that HarrietLady L writes Emily writes So I have only to say I am  Your humble Servant and soforth CH G  LETTER XVII  Miss  BYRON  To Lady  G  Selbyhouse  Thursday Oct    My dear Lady  G  I Expect your brother every hour I hope he comes in pursuance of Letters from ItalyMay it be so and such as will not abate his welcome  We heard by accident of his approach by a farmer tenant to my uncle who saw a fine gentleman very handsomely attended alight as he left Statford at the very inn where we baited on our return from London As a dinner was preparing for him perhaps my dear he will dine in the very room he dined in at that time The farmer had the curiosity to ask  who he was and was answered by the most courteous gentleman's servants he ever spoke to that they had the honour to serve Sir Charles Grandison And the farmer having said he was of Northampton one of them asked him How far Selbyhouse was from that town The farmer was obliged to hurry home on his own affairs and meeting my uncle with Mr Deane and my cousin James Selby taking an airing on horseback told him the visiter he was likely to have My uncle instantly dispatched his servant to us with the tidings and that he was gone to meet him in hopes of conducting him hither  This news gave me so much emotion being not well before that my aunt advised me to retire to my closet and endeavour to quiet my Spirits  Here then I am my dear Lady G and the writingimplements being alway  at hand in this place I took up my pen It is not possible for me to write at this time but to you and on this subject It is good for a busy mind to have something to be employed in and I think now I am amusing myself on paper my heart is a little more governable than it was  I am glad we heard of his coming before we saw him But surely Sir Charles Grandison should not have attempted to  surprise  us Should he my dear Does it not look like the pride of a man assured of a joyful welcome I have read of princes who acquianted with their Ladies by picture only and having been married by proxy have set out to their frontiers in  ognito and in disguise have affected to surprise the poor apprehensive brideBut here not only circumstances differ since there has been no betrothment but were he of princely rank I should have expected a more delicate treatment from him  How will the consciousness of inferiority and obligation set a proud and punctilious mind upon hunting for occasions to justify its capricesA servant of  Sir Charles is just arrived with a billet directed for my uncle Selby My aunt opened it It is dated from Stratford The contents are after compliments of enquiry of our healths to acquaint my uncle that he shall put up at the George at Northampton this night and hopes to be allowed to pay his compliments to us tomorrow morning at breakfast So he did not  intend  to give himself the consequence of which my capricious heart was so apprehensive Yet then as if resolved to find fault Is not this a little too parading for his natural freedom thought I Or does he think we should not be able to outlive our joyful surprize if he gave us not notice of his arrival in these parts before he saw usO ClementinaGoodness Angel What a meremortal what a woman dost thou make the poor Harriet Byron appear in her own eyes How apprehensive of coming after thee The sense I have of my own littleness will make me little indeed  Well but I presume that if my uncle and Mr Deane meet him they will prevail on him to come hither this night Yet I suppose he must be allowed to go to the proposed inn afterwardsBut here he is comeCome indeedMy uncle in the chariot with him My cousin and Mr Deane Sally tells me just alighted Sally adores Sir Charles GrandisonBegone Sally Thy emotions foolish wench add to those of thy mistress  THAT I might avoid the appearance of affectation I was going down to welcome him when I met my uncle on the stairs Niece Byron said he you have not done  justice  to Sir Charles Grandison I thought your  Lovesick heart  What words were these my dear and at that moment too must have been partial to him He prevailed on me to go into his chariot You may think yourself very happy For fifteen miles together did he talk of nobody but you Let  me  go down with you Let me present you to him  I had before besought my spirits to befriend me but for one halfhour Surely there is nothing so unwelcome as an unseasonable jest  Present me to him Lovesick heart  O my uncle thought I I was unable to proceed I hastened back to my closet as much disconcerted as a child could be who having taken pains to get its lesson by heart dashed by a chiding countenance forgot every syllable of it when it came to  say  it You know my dear that I had not of some time been well My spirits were weak and joy was almost as painful to me as grief could have been  My aunt came upMy love why don't you come downWhat now Why in tearsYou will appear to the finest man I ever saw in my life very particularMr Deane is in love with him Your cousin James  Dear madam I am already when I make comparisons between him and myself humbled enough with his excellencies I did  intend  to avoid particularity but my uncle has quite disconcerted meYet he always means well I ought not to complain I attend you madam  Can you Lady G forgive my pride my petulance  My aunt went down before me Sir Charles hastened to me the moment I appeared with an air of respectful love  He took my hand and bowing upon it I rejoice to see my dear Miss Byron and to see her so well How many sufferers must there be when you suffer  I bid him welcome to England I hope he heard me I could not help speaking low He must observe my discomposure He led me to a seat and sat down by me still holding my hand I withdrew it not presently left he should think me precise But as there were so many persons present I thought it was free in Sir Grandison Yet perhaps he could  not well quit it as I did not withdraw it so that the fault might be rather in my passiveness than in his forwardness  However I asked my aunt afterwards If his looks were not those of a man assured of success as indeed he might be from my grandmother's Letter and my silence to  his  She said there was a manly freedom in his address to me but that it had such a mixture of tenderness in it that never in  her  eyes was freedom so becoming While he was restrained by his situation added she no wonder that he treated you with respect only as a  Friend  but now he finds himself at liberty to address you his behaviour ought as a  Lover  to have just been what it was  Sir Charles led me into talk by mentioning you and Lady L your two Lords and my Emily  My uncle and aunt withdrew and had some little canvassings it seems All their canvassings are those of assured Lovers about the propriety of my uncle's invitation to Sir Charles to take up his residence while he was in these parts at Selbyhouse My uncle at coming in had directed Sir Charles's servants to put up their horses But they not having their master's orders to do so held themselves in readiness to attend him as they knew that Sir Charles had given directions to his gentleman Richard Saunders who brought the billet to my uncle to go back to Northhampton and provide apartments for him at the George inn there  My aunt who you know is a perfect judge of points of decorum pleaded to my uncle that it was too well known among our select friends by Mr Greville's means that Sir Charles had never before made his addresses to me and that therefore tho' he was to be treated as a man whose alliance is considered as an honour to us yet that some measures were to be kept as to the  look  of the thing and that the world might not conclude that I was to be won at his very  first appearance and the rather as Mr Greville's violence as well as virulence was so well known  My uncle was petulant  I  said he am always in the wrong You women never He ran into all those peculiarities of words for which you have so often raillied himHis  adsheart  his  female scrupulosities  his  What a pize  his hatred of  shillyshally's  and  fiddlefaddles  and the rest of our  female nonsenses  as he calls them He hoped to salute his niece as Lady Grandison in a fortnight What a  duce  was the matter it could  not  be so both sides now of a mindHe warned my aunt and bid her warn me against affectation now the crisis was at hand Sir Charles he said would think meanly of us if we were  silly  And then came in another of his odd words Sir Charles he said had been so much already  bamboozled  that he would not have patience with us and  therefore  and for all these  reasons  as he called them he desired that Sir Charles might not be suffered to go out of the house and to an inn and this as well for the  propriety  of the thing as for the credit of his own invitation to him  My aunt replied that Sir Charles  himself  would expect delicacy from us It was evident that he expected not no doubt for the sake of the world's eye to reside in the house with  me  on his  first  visit by his having ordered his servant who brought the billet to take apartments for him at Northampton even not designing to visit us overnight had he not been met by Mr Deane and himself and  persuaded  to come In short my dear said my aunt I am as much concerned about Sir Charles's  own  opinion of our conduct as for that of the world Yet you know that every genteel family around us expected examples from us and Harriet If Sir Charles is not with us the oftener he visits us the more respectful it will be construed I hope he will live with us all day and every day But indeed it must be as a visiter not as an inmate  Why then bring me off somehow that I may not seem the blunderer you are always making me by your  documents  Will you do  that  When my uncle and aunt came in they found Sir Charles and Dr Deane and me talking Our subject was the happiness of Lord and Lady W and the whole Mansfield family with whom Mr Deane who began the discourse is well acquainted Sir Charles arose at their entrance The night draws on said heI will do myself the honour of attending you madam and this happy family at tea in the morningMy good Mr Selby I had a design upon you and Mr Deane and upon you young gentleman to my cousin James as I told you on the road but it is now too late Adieu till tomorrowHe bowed to each to me profoundly kissing my hand and went to his chariot  My uncle whispered my aunt as we all attended him to that door of the hall which leads into the courtyard to invite him to stay Hang punctilio he said  My aunt wanted to speak to Sir Charles yet she owned she knew not what to say Such a conscious aukwardness had indeed possession of us both as made us uneasy We thought all was not right yet knew not that we were wrong But when Sir Charles's chariot drove away with him and we took our seats and supper was talked of we all of us shewed dissatisfaction and my uncle was quite out of humour He would give a thousand pounds he said with all his heart and soul to find in the morning Sir Charles instead of coming hither to breakfast had set out on his return to London  For my part Lady G I could not bear these recriminations I begged to be excused sitting down to supper I was not well and this odd situation added  uneasiness  to my indisposition A dissatisfaction that I find will mingle with our highest enjoyments Nor  were the beloved company I left happier They canvassed the matter with so much goodnatured earnestness that the supper was taken away as it was brought at a late hour  What my dear Lady G in your opinion should we have done Were we right or were we wrong Overdelicacy as I have heard observed is underdelicacy You my dear your Lord our Emily and Dr Bartlett all standing in so wellknown a degree of relation to Sir Charles Grandison were our most welcome guests And was not the brother to be received with equal warmth of respectO no Custom it seems tyrant custom and the apprehended opinion of the world obliged us especially as so much bustle had been made about me by men so bold so impetuous to shew himShew him whatIn effect that we had expectations upon him which we could not have upon the brother and sister and therefore because we hoped he would be more  near  we were to keep him at the  greater  distanceWhat an indirect acknowledgment was this in his favour were there room for him to doubt Which however there could not be What would I give said my aunt to me this moment to know  his  thoughts of the matter  Lucy and Nancy will be here at dinner so will my grandmamma She has with her usual enquiries after my health congratulated me by this line sealed up  'I long my best love to embrace you on the joyful occasion I need say no more than that I think myself at this instant one of the happiest of women I shall dine with you today Adieu till then joy of my heart my own Harriet'  Lucy in a Billet just now brought written for herself and Nancy on the intelligence sent her of Sir Charles's arrival expresses herself thus  'Our joy is extreme Blessings on the man Blessings attend our Harriet They must Sir Charles Grandison brings them with himself Health now will return to our lovely cousin We long to see the man of whom we have heard so much We will dine with you Tell Sir Charles before we come that you love us dearly It shall make us redouble our endeavours to deserve your love Your declared friendship and love of us will give consequence to  'LUCY SELBY  'NANCY SELBY  We are now in expectationMy aunt and I tho' early risers hurried ourselves to get everything that however is never out of order in higher order Both of us have a kind of consciousness of defect where yet we cannot find reason for it If we did we should supply it Yet we are careful that everything has a natural not an extraordinary appearanceEase with propriety shall be our aim My aunt says that were the King to make us a visit she is sure she could not have a greater desire to pleaseI will go down that I may avoid the appearance of parade and reserve when he comes  Here in her closet again is your poor Harriet Surely the determined single state is the happiest of lives to young women who have the greatness of mind to be above valuing the admiration and flatteries of the other Sex What tumults what a contrariety of passions break the tranquility of the woman who yields up her heart to LoveNo Sir Charles Grandison my dearYet ten o'clockHe is a very  prudent  manNo expectations  hurry  or  discompose  him Charming  steadiness of Soul  A fine thing for himself but  far  otherwise for the woman when a man is  secure  He will possibly ask me and hold  again my passive hand in presence of half a score of my friends Whether I was  greatly  uneasy because of his absence  But let me try to  excuse  him May he not have  forfot  his engagement May he not have  over slept  himselfSome  agreeable dream  of the Bologna familyI am offended at himDid he learn this tranquility in ItalyO no no Lady G  I now cannot help looking back for  other  faults in him with regard to me My memory is not however so malicious as I would have it But do you think every man in the like situation would have stopt at Stratford to dine by himselfNot but your brother can be very happy in his  own  company If  he  cannot who can But as to that his horses might require rest as well as baiting One knows not in how short a time he might have prosecuted his journey so far He who will not suffer the noblest of all animals to be deprived of an ornament would be merciful to them in greater instances He says that he cannot bear indignity from superiors Neither can we In that light he appears to us But why soMy heart Lady G begins to swell I assure you and it it twice as big as it was last night  My uncle before I came up sat with his watch in his hand from half an hour after nine till near ten telling the minutes as they crept Mr Deane often looked at me and at my aunt as if to see how we bore it I blushed looked silly as if your brother's faults were mineOver in a fortnight cried my uncle  adsheart  I believe it will be half a year before we shall come to the question But Sir Charles to be sure is offended Your confounded female niceties  My heart roseLet him if he  dare  thought the proud Harriet  God grant added my uncle that he may be gone up to town again▪  Perhaps said Mr Deane he is gone by mistake to Mrs Shirley's  We then endeavoured to recollect the words of his selfinvitation hither My cousin James proposed to take horse and go to Northampton to inform himself of the occasion of his not coming Some misfortune perhaps  Had he not servants my aunt asked one of whom he might have sentShall my cousin Jemmy go however Harriet said she  No indeed answered I with an air of angerMy teazing uncle broke out into a loud laugh which however had more of a vexedness than mirth in itHe is certainly gone to London Harriet  Just  as I said dame SelbyCertainly tearing up the road his very horses resenting for their master your  scrupulosities  You'll hear from him next at London my life for yours nieceHah hah hah What will your  grandmamma  say byandby Lucy Nancy how will  they  stare Last night's supper and this day's dinner will be alike served in and taken away  I could not stand all this I arose from my seat Are you not unkind Sir said I to my uncle courtesying to him however and desiring his and Mr Deane's excuse quitted the breakfasting parlour Teazing man said my aunt Mr Deane also blamed him gently however for everybody acknowledges his good heart and natural good temper  My aunt followed me to the door and taking my hand Harriet said she speaking low Not Sir Charles Grandison himself shall call you his if he is capable of treating you with the least indifference I understand not this added she He cannot surely be offendedI hope all will be cleared up before your grandmamma comes She will be very jealous of the honour of her girl  I answered not I could not answer But hastened up to my place of refuge and after wiping from my  cheeks a few tears of real vexation took up my pen You love to know my thoughts as occasions arise You bid me continue to write to the momentHere comes my aunt  My aunt came in with a Billet in her handCome down to breakfast my dear Sir Charles comes not till dinnertime Read this It was brought by one of his servants He left it with Andrew The dunce let him go I wanted to have asked him a hundred questions  To Mrs  SELBY  Dear Madam  I Am broke in upon by a most  impertinent  visiter Such at this time must have been the dearest friend I have in the world You will be so good as to excuse my attendance till dinnertime For the past two hours I thought every moment of disengaging myself or I should have sent sooner  Ever Yours  c  What visiter said I can make a man stay against his mindWho can get rid politely of an  impertinent  visiter if Sir Charles Grandison cannot on a previous engagementBut come madam I attend youDown we went  My uncle was out of patience I was sorry for it I tried to make the best of it yet but to pacify him should perhaps have had petulance enough myself to make the worst of itOy oy with all my heart said he in answer to my excuses let us hear what Sir Charles has to say for himself But old as I am were my dame Selby to give me another chance no man on earth I can tell you should keep me from a previous engagement with my mistress It is kind of you Harriet to excuse him however Love hides a multitude of saults  My aunt said not one syllable in behalf of Sir Charles She is vexed and disappointed  We made a very short breakfasting and looked upon one another as people who would have helped themselves if they could Mr Deane however would engage he said that we should be fatisfied with Sir Charles's excuses when we came to hear them  But my dear this man this visiter whoever he is must be of  prodigious  importance to detain him from an engagement that I had hoped might have been thought a  first  engagementyet owned to be  impertinent  And must not the accident be very uncommon that should bring such a one a stranger as Sir Charles is in his way Yet this might very well happen my uncle observes at an  inn  whither we thought fit to send him  Now I think of it I was strangely disturbed last night in my imperfect slumbers Something I thought was to happen to prevent me ever being his But hence Recollection I chase thee from me Yet when realities disturb shadows will officiously obtrude on the busy imagination  as  realities  Friday    o'Clock  My grandmamma is comeLucy Nancy are comeO how vexed at our disappointment and chagrin are my two cousins But my grandmamma joins with Mr Deane to think the best I have stolen up But here he is come How shall I do to  keep  my anger He shall find me below I will see how he looks at entrance among us  If  he is careless  If  he makes slight excuses  LETTER XVIII  Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Friday Two o'Clock  I Am stolen up again to tell you how it is I never will be petulant againDear Sir forgive me How wicked in us all but my grandmamma and Mr Deane to blame a man who cannot be guilty of a wilful fault The fault is all my aunt's and mineWas my aunt ever in fault before  We were all together when he entered He addressed himself to us in that noble manner which engages everybody in his favour at first sight How said he bowing to every one have I suffered in being hindered by an unhappy man from doing myself the honour of attending you sooner  You see my dear he made not apologies to  me  as if he supposed me disappointed by his absence I was afraid he would I know I looked very grave  He then particularly addressed himself to each to me first next to my grandmamma and taking one of her hands between both his and bowing upon it I rejoice to see you madam said heYour last favours will ever be remembered by me with gratitude I see you well I hope Your Miss Byron will be well if  you  are and  our  joy looking round him will then be complete  She bowed her head pleased with his compliment so were my aunt and Lucy and Nancy I was still a little sullen otherwise I should have been pleased too that he made my health depend on that of my grandmamma  Madam said he turning to my aunt I am afraid I made you wait for me at breakfast A most impertinent visiter He put me out of humour I dared not to let you and  yours  looking at me see how  much I  could  be out of humour I am naturally passionate But passion is so ugly so deforming a thing that if I can help it I will never by those I love be seen in it  I am sorry Sir said my aunt you meet with anything to disturb you  My uncle's spirit had not come down He too was sullen in behalf of the punctilio of the girl whom he honours with his jealous Love How how is that Sir Charles said he  My aunt presented Lucy and Nancy to him But before she could name eitherMiss Selby said he Miss Byron's  own  Lucy I am sure Miss Nancy SelbyI know your characters Ladies saluting each and I know the interest you have in Miss ByronHonour me with  your  approbation and that will be to give me hope of  hers  He then turning to my uncle and Mr Deane and taking a hand of eachMy dear Mr Deane smiles upon me said heBut Mr Selby looks grave  At  ten  tive only Sir Charles to the  cause  of your being put out of humour that's all  The cause Mr SelbyKnow then I met with a man at my inn who would force himself upon me Do you know I am a qurrelsome man He was so hardy as to declare that he had pretensions to a Lady in this company which he was determined to assert  O that Greville said my aunt  I was ready to sink Wretched Harriet thought I at the instant Am I to be for ever the occasion of embroiling this excellent man  My grandmamma Mr Deane my uncle my cousin James all spoke at onceDear dear Sir Charles said one said anotherHow how was it  Both safe Both unhurt No more of the rash man at this time He is to be pitied He loves Miss Byron to distraction  This comes of nicety whispered my uncle to my aunt  foolish  nicetyTo let such a man as this go to an innInhospitable vile punctilio Then turning to Sir CharlesDear Sir forgive me I  was  a little serious that I must own I pulled my uncle by the sleeve fearing he would say too much by way of atonement for his seriousnessI I I  was  a little serious I must own I I I was afraid something was the matterturned he off what he was going to saytoo freely shall I sayHardly so had he said what he would tho' habitual punctilio made me almost involuntarily twitch my uncle by the sleeve for my heart would have directed my lips to utter the kindest things but my concern was too great to allow them to obey it  I must go down Lady GI am enquired after 'tis just dinnertimeLet me only add that Sir Charles waved further talk of the affair between him and that wretch while I staidperhaps they have got it out of him since I came up  I SHALL be  so  proud my deara thousand fine things he has said of your Harriet in her little absenceLucy Nancy call him THE man And every one looks upon him as if there were not one soul in company but  he  and themselves My grandmamma's eyes are complained of as weak to colour her joyful emotion But thank God her eyes are not weak And he is so respectfully tender to her that had he not my heart before he would have won it now  He had again waved the relation of the insult he met with Mr Greville himself he supposed would give it He had a mind to see if the gentleman by his report of it was a gentleman Thank God said he I have not hurt a man who boasts of his passion for Miss Byron and of his neighbourhood to this family  OUR places were chosen for us at table Sir Charles's next me Cannot I be too minute do you saySo easy so free so polite something so happily addressed occasionally to each person at tableO my dear I am abundantly kept in countenance for every one loves him as well as I You have been pleased to take very favourable notice of our servantsThey  are  good and sensible What reverence for him and joy for their young mistress's sake shone in their countenances as they attended  My cousin James who has never been out of England was very curious to be informed of the manners customs diversions of the people in different countriesItaly in particularAh the dear Clementina What abatement from recollection  'The sighing heart'  I remember he says in one of his Letters to Dr Bartlett  'will remind us of imperfection in the highest of our enjoyments  ' And he adds  'It is fit it should be so'  And on what occasion did he write thisO my Charlotte  I  was the occasion It was in kind remembrance of me He could not at that time have so written had he been indifferent even then to your Harriet  I am so apprehensive of my uncle's after remarks that I am halfafraid to look at Sir Charles And he must byandby return to this wicked innThey wonder at my frequent absences It is to oblige you Lady G and indeed myself There is vast pleasure in communicating one's pleasures to a friend who interests herself as you do in one's dearest concerns  YOU know and admire my grandmamma's chearful compliances with the innocent diversions of youth She made Lucy give us a lesson on the harpsichord on purpose I saw to draw me in We both obeyed  I was once a little out in an Italian song In what a sweet manner did he put me in▪ touching the keys  himself for a minute or two Every one wished him to proceed but he gave up to me in so polite a manner that we all were satisfied with his excuses  My poor cousin Jemmy is on a sudden very earnest to go abroad as if silly youth travelling would make him a Sir Charles Grandison  I have just asked your brother If all is over between Mr Greville and him He says He hopes and believes so God send it may or I shall hate that Greville  MY uncle Mr Deane and my cousin James were too much taken with Sir Charles to think of withdrawing as it might have been expected they would and after some general conversation that succeeded our playing Sir Charles drew his chair between my grandmamma and aunt and taking my grandmamma's hand May I not be allowed a quarter of an hour's conversation with Miss Byron in your presence Ladies said he speaking low We have indeed only friends and relations present But it will be most agreeable I believe to the dear Lady that what I have to say to her and to you may be rather reported  to  the gentlemen than heard  by  them  By all means Sir Charles said my grandmamma Then whispering to my aunt No man in this company  thinks  but Sir Charles Excuse me my dear  The moment Sir Charles applied himself in this particular manner to them my heart without hearing what he said was at my mouth I arose and withdrew to the cedarparlour followed by Lucy and Nancy The gentlemen seeming to recollect themselves withdrew likewise to another apartment My aunt came to meLoveBut ah my dear how you trembleYou must come with  me  And then she told me what he had said to my grandmamma and her  I have no courageNone at all said I If apprehension  if timidy be signs of Love I have them all Sir Charles Grandison has not one  Nay my dear said Lucy impute not to him want of respect I beseech you  Respect  my Lucy What a poor wordHad I only respect for him we should be nearer an equalityHas he said anything of Lady Clementina  Don't be silly Harriet said my aunt You used to be  Used to be  Ah madam I Sir Charles's heart at  best  a divided heart I never had a trial till now  I tell you all my foibles Lady G  My aunt led me in to Sir Charles and my grandmamma He met me at my entrance into the room and in the most engaging manner my aunt having taken her seat conducted me to a chair which happened to be vacant between her and my grandmother He took no notice of my emotion and I the sooner recovered myself and still the sooner as he himself seemed to be in some little confusion However he sat down and with a manly yet respectful air his voice gaining strength as he proceeded thus delivered himself  Never Ladies was man more particularly circumstanced than he before you You know my story You know what once were the difficulties of my situation with a family that I must ever respect with a Lady of it whom I must ever revere And you madam to my grandmamma have had the goodness to signify to me in a most engaging manner that Miss Byron has added to the innumerable instances which she has given me of her true greatness of mind a  kind  and even a  friendly  concern for a Lady who is the Miss Byron of Italy I ask not excuse for the comparison The heart of the man before you madam to me in sincerity and frankness emulates your own  You want not excuse Sir said my grandmamma  We all reverence Lady Clementina We admire her  He bowed to  each  of us as my aunt and I looked I believe assentingly to what my grandmamma said He proceeded  Yet in so particular a situation altho' what I have to say may I presume be collected from what you know of my story and tho' my humble application to Miss Byron for her favour and to you Ladies for your interest with her have not been discouraged something however may be necessary to be said in this audience of the state of my own heart for the sake of this dear Lady's delicacy and yours And I will deliver myself with all the truth and plainness which I think are required in treaties of this nature equally with those set on foot between nation and nation  I am not insensible to Beauty But the beauty of person  only  never yet had power over more than my eye to which it gave a pleasure like that which it receives from the flowers of a gay parterre Had  not  my heart been out of the reach of  personal  attractions if I may so express myself and had I been my own master Miss Byron in the first hour that I saw her for her beauty suffered not by her distress would have left me no other choice But when I had the honour of conversing with her I observed in her mind and behaviour that true dignity delicacy and noble frankness which I ever thought characteristic in the Sex but never met with in equal degree but in  one  Lady I soon found that my admiration of her fine qualities was likely to lead me into a gentler yet a more irresistable passion For of the Lady abroad I then could have no reasonable at least no  probable  hope Yet were there circumstances between her and me which I thought in strict justice obliged me to attend the issue of certain events  I called myself therefore to account and was  alarmed when I found that Miss Byron's graces had stolen so imperceptibly on my heart as already to have made an impression on it too deep for my tranquillity I determined therefore in honour in justice to both Ladies to endeavour to restrain a passion so new yet likely to be so servent  I had avocations in town while Miss Byron was with my sisters in the country Almost afraid of trusting myself in her presence I pursued the  more  willingly those avocations in person when I could have managed some of them perhaps near as well by other hands Compassion for the one Lady because of her calamity might at that time I found have been made to give way  could those calamities have been overcome  to Love for the other Nor was it difficult for me to observe that my sisters and Lord L who knew nothing of my situation would have chosen for a sister the young Lady present before every other woman  Sometimes I will own to you I was ready from that selfpartiality and vanity which is too natural to men of vivacity and strong hopes to flatter myself that I might  by my sisters interest  have made myself  not unacceptable  to a Lady who seemed to be wholly disengaged in her affections But I would not permit myself to dwell on such hopes Every look of complaisance every smile which used to beam over that lovely countenance I attributed to her natural goodness and frankness of heart and to that grateful spirit which made her overrate a common service that I had been so happy as to render her Had I even been free I should have been careful not to deprive myself of that animating sunshine by a too early declaration For well did I know by  other  mens experience that Miss Byron at the same time that her natural politeness and sweetness of manners engaged every heart was not however easily to be won  But notwithstanding all my efforts to prevent a  competition which had grown so fast upon me I still found my uneasiness increase with my affection for Miss Byron I had then but one way leftIt was to strengthen my heart in Clementina's cause by Miss Byron's assistance In short to acquaint Miss Byron with my situation to engage her generosity for Clementina and thereby deprive myself of the encouragement my fond heart might have hoped for had I indulged my wishes of obtaining her favour My end was answered as to the latter Miss Byron's generosity was engaged for the Lady but was it possible that my obligations to her for that generosity should not add to my admiration of her  At the time I laid before her my situation it was in Lord L's Study at Colnebrooke she saw my emotion I could not conceal it My abrupt departure from her must convince her that my heart was too much engaged for that situation  See Vol III p  I desired Dr Bartlett to take an airing with me in hopes by his counsels to compose my disordered spirits  Ibid p  He knew the state of my heart He knew with regard to the proposals I had formerly made to the family at Bologna relating to Religion and Residence as I had also declared to the brothers of the Lady that no worldly grandeur should ever have induced me to allow in a  beginning  address the terms I was willing as a compromise to allow to that Lady for thoroughly had I weighed the inconveniencies which must attend such an alliance The Lady zealous in her Religion the Confelsor who was to be allowed her equally zealous the spirit of making proselytes so strong and held by Roman Catholics to be so meritorious and myself no less in earnest in my Religion I had no doubt to pronounce I told the good Doctor in confidence  'that I should be much more happy in marriage with the Lady of Selbyhouse were she to be induced to  honour me with her hand than it was possible I could be with Lady Clementina even were they to comply with the conditions I had proposed as I doubted not but that Lady would  also  be were her health restored with a man of her own nation and Religion'  And I owned to him besides  'that I could have no hope of conquering the opposition given me by the friends of Clementina and that I could not at times but think hardly of the indignities cast upon me by some of them'  The doctor I knew at the same time that he lamented the evil treatment Clementina met with from her mistaken friends and her unhappy malady and admired her for her manifold excellencies next to adored Miss Byron And he gave his voice accordingly  'But here doctor is the case said IClementina is a woman with whom I had the honour of being acquainted before I knew Miss Byron Clementina has infinite merits She herself refused me not  She  consented to accept of the terms I offered She even besought her friends to comply with them She has an opinion of my honour and of my tenderness for her Till I had the happiness of knowing Miss Byron I was determined to await either her recovery or release and will Miss Byron herself if she knows that forgive me the circumstances not changed for the change of a resolution of which Clementina was so worthy The treatment the poor Lady has met with  for my sake  as once she wrote tho' virgin modesty induced her to cross out those words has heightened her disorder She still to this moment wishes to see me While there is a possibility tho' not a probability of my being made the humble instrument of restoring an excellent woman who in herself deserves from me every consideration of tenderness  ought  I to wish to engage the heart were I able to succeed in my wishes of the  equally  excellent Miss ByronCould  I be happy in my own mind were I to try and to succeed And if not must I not be as ungrateful to her as ungenerous to the otherMiss Byron's happiness cannot depend on  me  She  must  be happy in the happiness she will give to the man of her choice  whoever  shall be the man'  We were all silent My grandmamma and aunt seemed determined to be so and I  could  not speak He proceeded  You know not dear Miss Byron I wished you  not  to know the conflicts my mind laboured with when I parted with you on my going abroad My destiny was wrapt up in doubt and uncertainty I was invited over Signor Jeronymo was deemed irrecoverable He wished to see me and desired but to  live  to see me My presence was requested as a last effort to recover his noble sister You yourself madam applauded my resolution to go But that I might not be thought to wish to engage you in my favour so circumstanced as I was that to have done so would have been to have acted unworthily to  both  Ladies I insinuated my hopelessness of ever being nearer to you than I was  I was not able to take a formal leave of you I went over Success attended the kind the soothing treatment which Clementina met with from her friends Success also attended the means used for the recovery of the noble Jeronymo Conditions were again proposed Clementina on her restoration shone upon us all even with a brighter lustre than she did before her disorder All her friends consented to reward with the hand of their beloved daughter the man to whom they attributed secondarily the good they rejoiced in I own to you Ladies that what was before  honour  and  compassion  now became  admiration  and I should have been unjust to the merits of so excellent a woman if I could not say  Love  I concluded myself already the husband of Clementina yet it would have  been strange if the welfare and happiness of Miss Byron were not the next wish of my heart I rejoiced that despairing as I did of such an event before I went over because of the articles of Religion and Residence I had not sought to engage more than her friendship and I devoted myself wholly to Clementina  I own it Ladies  And had I thought Angel as she came out upon proof that I could not have given her my heart I had been equally unjust and ungrateful For dear Ladies if you know all her story you must know that occasion called her out to act gloriously and that gloriously she answered the call  He paused We were still silent My grandmamma and aunt looked at each other by turns But their eyes as well as mine at different parts of his speech shewed their sensibility He proceeded gracefully looking down and at first with some little hesitation  I am sensible it was with a very ill grace that  refused  as I must in justice call it tho' on the noblest motives by Clementina I come to offer myself and so soon after her refusal to a Lady of Miss Byron's delicacy I should certainly have acted more laudably respecting my own character  only  had I taken at least the usual time of a  WidowerLove  But great minds such as Miss Byron's and yours Ladies are above common forms where decorum is not too much neglected As to myself what do I but declare a passion that would have been but for one obstacle which is now removed as servent as man ever knew Dr Bartlett has told me madam  to me  that you and my sisters have seen the Letters I wrote to him from Italy By the contents of some of those and of the Letters I left with  you  madam  to my grandmamma  you have seen Clementina's constant adherence to the step she so greatly took In this Letter received but last Wednesday taking one out of  his bosom you will see my last Letters to them unreceived as they must be that I am urged by all her family for the sake of setting  her  an example to address myself to a Lady of my own country This  impels  me as I may say to  accelerate  the humble tender of my vows to you madam However hasty the step may be thought in my situation Would not an inexcusable neglect or seeming indifference as if I were balancing as to the person have been attributable to me had I for  dull  and  cold  form's sake been capable of postponing the declaration of my affection to Miss Byron And if madam you can so far get over observances which perhaps on consideration will be found to be punctilious only as to give your heart with your hand to a man who himself has been perplexed by what some would call particular as it sounds a  double Love  an embarrasment however not of his own seeking or which he could possibly avoid you will lay him under obligation to your goodness to your magnanimity I will call it which all the affectionate tenderness of my life to come will never enable me to discharge  He then put the Letter a translation of it inclosed into my hand I have already answered it madam said he and acquainted my friend that I have actually tendered myself to the acceptance of a Lady worthy of a sisterly relation to their Clementina and have not been rejected Your goodness must enable me I humbly hope it will to give them still stronger assurances of your favour On my happiness they have the generosity to build a part of their own  Not well before I was more than once apprehensive of fainting as he talked agreeable as was his talk and engaging as was his manner My grandmamma and aunt saw my complexion change at his particular address to me in the last part of his speech Each put her kind hand on one of mine and held it on it as my other hand held my handkerchief now  to my eyes and now as a cover to my selffelt varying cheek  At the same moment that he ceased speaking he took our triplyunited hands in both his and in the most respectful yet graceful manner his Letter laid in my lap pressed each of the three with his lips mine twice I could not speak My grandmamma and aunt delighted yet tears standing in their eyes looked upon each other and upon me each as expecting the other to speak I have perhaps said he with some emotion taken up too much of Miss Byron's attention on this my first personal declaration I will now return to the company below Tomorrow I will do myself the honour to dine with you We will for this evening postpone the important subject Miss Byron I presume will be best pleased to have it so I shall tomorrow be favoured with the result of your deliberations Mean time may I meet with an interceding friend in every one I have had the pleasure to see this day I must flatter myself with the honour of Miss Byron's  whole  heart as well as with the approbation of all her friends I cannot be thought at  present  to deserve it but it shall be the endeavour of my life so to do  He withdrew with a grace which was all his own  The moment he was gone from us my grandmamma threw her arms about her Harriet then about my aunt and they congratulated me and each other  We were all pained at heart when we read the Letter It is from Signor Jeronymo urging your brother to set the example to his sister which they so much want her to follow I send you the translation Pray return it Poor Lady Clementina Without seeing the last Letters he wrote to them she seems to be tired into compliance I will not say one half that is upon my mind on this occasion as you will have the Letter before you His lastwritten Letters  will not favour her wishes Poor Lady Can I forbear to pity her And still the more is she to be pitied as your brother's excellencies rise upon us  I besought my aunt to excuse me to the company  Sir Charles joined his friends HIS friends indeed they are all with a vivacity in his air and manner which charmed everybody while the silly heart of your Harriet would not allow her to enter into company the whole night Indeed it wanted the inducement of his presence for to every one's regret he declined staying supper yet my uncle put it to himWhat Sir do you choose to sup at your inn My uncle will have it that Sir Charles  looked  an answer of displeasure for suffering him to go to it atall My uncle is a goodnatured man He will sometimes concede when he is not convinced and on every appearance which makes for his opinion we are sure to hear of it  I shall have an opportunity tomorrow morning early This morning I might say to send this long Letter by a neighbour who is obliged to ride post to town on his own affairs  Had I  not  had this agreeable employment rest I am sure would not have come near me Your brother I hope has found it Remember I always mean to include my dear Lady L in this correspondence Anybody else but discretionally My dear Ladies both Adieu  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XIX  Signor  JERONYMO  della  PORRETTA  To Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  Bologna  Sunday Sept    Oct    WE have at last my Grandison some hopes given us that our dear Clementina will yield to our wishes  The General with his Lady made us a visit from Naples on purpose to make a decisive effort as he called it and vowed that he would not return till he left her in a disposition to oblige us The Bishop at one time brought the Patriarch to reason with her who told her that she ought not to think of the veil unless her father and mother consented to her assuming it  Mrs Beaumont was prevailed upon to favour us with her company She declared for us And on Thursday last Clementina was still harder set Her Father Mother the General and his Lady the Bishop all came into my chamber and sent for her She came Then did we all supplicate her to oblige us The General was at first tenderly urgent The Bishop besought her The young Marchioness pressed her Her Mother took her hand between both hers and in silent tears could only sigh over it And lastly my Father dropt down on one knee to her My daughter my child said he oblige me Your Jeronymo could not refrain from tears  She fell on her kneeO my Father said she rise or I shall die at your feet Rise my Father  Not my dear till you consent to oblige me  Grant me but a little time my Father my dear my indulgent Father  The General thought he saw a flexibility which we had never before seen in her on this subject and called upon her for her  instant  determination Shall a Father kneel in vain said he Shall a Mother in weeping silence in vain entreatNow my sister complyorHe sternly stopt  Have patience with me said she but till the Chevalier's next Letters come You expect them soon Let me receive his next Letter And putting her hand to her foreheadRise my Father or I die at your feet  I thought the General pushed too hard I begged that the next Letters might be waited for  Be it so said my father rising and raising her But whatever be the contents remember my dearest child that I am your Father your indulgent Father and oblige me  My dear Clementina said the General will not this paternal goodness prevail upon you Your Father Mother Brothers are all ready to kneel to you Yet are we all to be slighted And is a foreigner an Englishman a Heretic great and noble as is the man a man too whom you have so gloriously refused to be preferred to us all Who can bear the thoughts of such a preference  And remember my Sister said the Bishop that you already know his opinion You have already had his advice in the Letters he wrote to you in the month's correspondence which passed between you before he left Italy Think you that the Chevalier Grandison can recede from an opinion solemnly given the circumstances not having varied  I have not been well It is wicked to oppose my Father my Mother I cannot argue with my Brothers I have not been well Spare me spare me my Lords to the General and the Bishop My Father gives me time Don't  you  deny it me  My mother afraid of renewing her disorder said Withdraw my dear if you choose to do so and compose yourself The intention is not to compel but to persuade you  O madam said she persuasion so strongly urged by my parents is  more  than compulsionI take the liberty you give me  She hurried to Mrs Beaumont and throwing her arms about her O madam I have been oppressed Oppressed by persuasion By a kneeling Father By a weeping Mother By entreating BrothersAnd this is but persuasionCruel persuasion  Mrs Beaumont then entered into argument with her She represented to her the General's inflexibility  Her Father's and Mother's indulgence The wishes of her two other Brothers She pleaded your opinion given as an impartial man not merely as a Protestant She told her of an admirable young Lady of your own country who was qualified to make you happy of whom she had heard several of your countrymen speak with great distinction This last plea as the intimate friendship between you and Mrs Beaumont is so well known took her attention She would not for the world stand in the way of the Chevalier Grandison She wished you to be happy she said whatever became of her Father Marescotti strongly enforced this point and advised her to come to some resolution  before  your next Letters arrived as it was not to be doubted but the contents of them would support your former opinion The Patriarch's arguments were reurged with additional force A day was named when she was again to be brought before her assembled friends Mrs Beaumont applauded her for the magnanimity she had already shewn in the discharge of her first duty and called upon her to distinguish herself equally in the filial  Clementina took time to consider of these and other arguments and after three hours passed in her closet she gave the following written paper to Mrs Beaumont which she said she hoped when read in full assembly would excuse her from attending her friends in the proposed congress  'I Am tired out my dear  Mrs Beaumont  with your kindlymeant importunities  'With the importunities prayers and entreaties of my  brothers  'O my  mamma  how well do you deserve even implicit obedience from a daughter who has overclouded your happy days You never knew discomfort till your hapless Clementina gave it you The sacrifice of my life would be a poor atonement for what I have made you suffer  'But who can withstand a  kneeling  Father Indeed my pappa ever good ever indulgent I dread to see you Let me not again behold you as on Thursday last  'I have denied to my self and  such  the motive that I must not I do not repent it the man I esteemed I never can be his  'Father Marescotti tho' he now loves the  man  suggests that my late disorder might be a judgment upon me for suffering my heart to be engaged by the  Heretic  'I am absolutely forbidden to think of atoning for my fault by the only measure that in my opinion could have done it  'You tell me Mrs Beamount and all my friends join with you that honour generosity and the esteem which I avow for the Chevalier Grandison as my friend as my fourth brother all join to oblige me to promote the happiness of a man I myself have disappointed And you are of opinion that there is one particular woman of his own country who is capable of making him happyBut do you say that I ought to give the  example  Impossible Honour and the punctilio of woman will not permit me to do  that    'But thus pressed thus dreading again to see a  kneeling  Father a weeping Mother and having reason to think I may not live long that a relapse into my former malady with the apprehensions of which Father Marescotti terrifies me may be the punishment of my disobedience Cruel Father Marescotti to terrify me with an affliction I so much dread and that it will be a consolation to me in my departing hour to reflect that I have obeyed my parents in an article on which their hearts are immoveably fixed and still further being assured that they will look upon my resignation as a compensation for all the troubles I have given them for many  many months passedGod enable me I pray to resign to  their  will But if I  cannot  shall I be still entreated still persuadedI hope notI will do my endeavour to prevail on myself to obeyBut whatever be the event of my Selfcontendings Grandison must give the example'  How did we congratulate ourselves when we read this paper faint as are the hopes it gives us  Our whole endeavour is now to treat her with tender observance that she may not think of receding Nor will we ask her to see the person she knows we favour till we can assure her that you will set her the example And if there be a Lady with whom you think you could be happy may not this my dear Grandison pleaded by you be a motive with her  The Count of Belvedere has made overtures to us which are too great for our acceptance were this alliance to take place We have been told but not by himself the danger to which his dispair had subjected him in more than one visit to you at Bologna had you not borne with his rashness You know him to be a man of probity of piety He is a zealous Catholic and you must allow that a religious zeal is a strengthener a confirmer of all the social sanctions He is learned and being a domestic man he contrary to the Italian custom admires in a wife those intellectual improvements which make a woman a fit companion for her husband You know how much the Marchioness excells almost all the women of quality in Italy in a taste for polite literature You know she has encouraged the same taste in her daughter and the Count considers her as the only woman in Italy with whom he can be happy  As you my Grandison cannot now be my brother by marriage the Count of Belvedere is the only man in the world I can wish to be so He is of Italy My sister always so dear to us and he will be ever  with us or we with them He knows the unhappy way she has been in and was so far from making that an objection that when her malady was at the height being ecouraged by physicians to hope that her recovery would be the probable consequence he would have thought himself the happiest of men could he have been honoured with her hand He knows her Love of you He adores her for her motive of refusing you He loves you and is confident of the inviolable honour of both Whose alliance on all these considerations can be so desirable to us as that with the Count of Belvedere  Surely my dear friend it  must  be in your power to set the example In  yours  who could subdue a whole family of zealous Catholics and keep your own religion and who could engage the virgin heart of one of the most delicate women in the world What woman who has a heart to bestow what family that has a daughter or sister to give can withstand you Religion and Country of both the same  Give us hope therefore my dear Grandison that you will make the effort Assure us that you will not scruple if you can succeed to set the example and on this assurance we will claim from Clementina the effects of the hope she has given us And if we  can  prevail will in England return you thanks for the numberless favours you have conferred upon us  Thus earnestly as well from inclination as in compliance with the pressing entreaties of every one of a family which I hope are still and ever will be dear to you do I your Jeronymo your Brother your Friend solicit you Mrs Beaumont joins with us She scruples not she bids me tell you to pronounce that you and Clementina will both be more happy she with the Count of Belvidere your respective Countries so distant your Religion so different you with an Englishwoman than you could have been with each other Mrs Beaumont has  owned to me in private that you often in conversation with her even while you had hope of calling Clementina yours lamented for her sake as well as your own the unhappy situation with respect to Religion you were both in and that you had declared more than once to her as indeed you did once to us that in a  beginning  address you would not have compromised thus with a Princess May we not expect everything my Grandison from your magnanimity We hope it is in your  power  and we doubt not your  will  to contribute to our happiness But whatever be the event I beseech you my dear friend continue to love  Your  JERONYMO  LETTER XX  Lady  G  To Miss  BYRON  GrosvenorSquare  Sunday Oct    CAN I forgive your pride your petulanceNo Harriet positively no I write to scold you and having  ordered  my Lord to sup abroad I shall perhaps  oblige  you with a long Letter We honest folks who have not abundance of Lovefooling upon our hands find ourselves happy in a good deal of quiet leisure and I love to chide and correct you wise onesThus then I begin  Ridiculous parade among you I blame you all Could he not have been Mrs Shirley's guest if he was not to be permitted to repose under the same roof with his sovereign Lady and Mistress But must you let him go to an innWhat for Why to shew the world he was but on a foot at present with your other humble servants and be  thought  no more by the insolent Greville and affronted as an invader of his rights Our Sex is a foolish Sex Too little or too much parade Lord help us Were it not that  we must be afraid to appear overforward to the man  himself  the world is a contemptible thing and we should treat it as such  And yet after all what with Lady Clementina what with the world and what with our own punctilio and palpitating hearts andsoforth and all that and more than all that I own you are pretty nicely circumstanced But my life for yours you will behave like a simpleton on occasion of his next address to you And why Did you ever know that people did not who are full of apprehensions who aimed at being very delicate who were solicitous to take their measures from the judgment of those without them pragmatical souls perhaps who from their notions either on what they have  read  or by the addresses to them of their own silly fellows aukward and unmeaning and by no means to be compared for integrity understanding politeness to my brother Consider child that he having seen in different countries perhaps a hundred women equally specious with the present mistress of his destiny were form and outward grace to be the attractives is  therefore  sitter to  give  than  take  the example  But Harriet I write to charge you not to increase your own difficulties by too much parade Your frankness of heart is a prime consideration with him He expects not to meet with the  girl  but the  sensible woman  in his address to you He is pursuing a laudable endDon't teaze him with pug's tricks  'What signifies asking me now'  Did you not lay your heads together And the wisest which ever were set on womens shoulders But indeed I never knew consultations of any kind turn to account It is only a parcel of people getting together proposing doubts and puzzling one another and ending as they began if not worse Doctors differ So many persons so many minds  And O how our petulant heart throbbed with indignation because he came not to breakfast with you What benefit has a polite man over an unpolite one where the latter shall have his rusticity allowed for  O that is his way  and when the other has expectations drawn upon him which if not  critically  answered he is not to be forgivenHe is a  prudent  man He may have  overslept  himselfMight dream of  Clementina  Then it was a fault in him that he stayed to dine on the roadHis horses might want rest truly▪Upon my word Harriet a woman in Love isa woman in Love Wise or foolish before we are all equally foolish then The same froward petulant captious babiesI protest we are very silly creatures all of us in these circumstances and did not Love make men as great fools as ourselves they would hardly think us worthy of their pursuit Yet I am so true to the Freemasonry myself that I would think the man who should dare to say half I have written of our  Dollships  ought not to go away with his life  My sister and I are troubled about this Greville Inform us the moment you can of the particulars of what passed between my brother and him pray do We long also to see the Letter he has put into your hands from Bologna It is on the road we hope  Caroline and I are as much concerned for your honour your punctilio as you or any of you can be But by the account you give me of my brother's address to you in presence of your grandmother and aunt as well as from our knowledge of his politeness neither you nor we need to trouble our heads about it It may be all left to him He knows so well what becomes the character of the woman whom he hopes to call his wife that you will be sure of your dignity being preserved if you place a confidence in him And yet no man is so much above mere formal regards as he is Let me enumerate instances from your Letter before me  His own intention in the first place not to surprise you by his visits as you apprehended he would which would have made him look like a man of selfimagined consequence to youHis providing himself with accommodations at an inn and not giving way to the invitation even of your  sagacious  uncle Selby I must raily him Does he spare meHis singling you out on Friday from your menfriends yet giving you the opportunity of your aunt's and grandmother's company to make his personal application to you for your favourHis requesting the interest of your other friends with you as if he presumed not on your former acquaintance and this after an application not discouraged made to your friends and you  As to his equanimity in his first address to you his retaining your hand forsooth before all your friends and soforth never find fault with that Hariet Indeed you do make an excuse for the very freedom you blameSo Loverlike He is the very man that a conscious young woman as you are should wish to be addressed by So much courage yet so much true modestyWhat I warrant you would have had a man chalked out for you▪ who should have stood at distance bowed scraped trembled while you had nothing to do but bridle and make stiff courtesies to him with your hands before youPlagued with  his  doubts and with  your can  dissidences afraid he would  now  and  now  and  now  pop out the question which he had not the courage to put and so running on simpering fretting fearing two parrallel lines side by side and never meeting till some interposing friends in pity to you both put one's head pointing to the other's head and stroking and clapping the shoulder of each set you at each other as men do by other dunghilbred creatures  You own he took no notice of your emotion when he first addressed himself to you so gave you  an opportunity to look up which otherwise you would have wanted Now don't you think you know a man creature or two who would on such an occasion have grinned you quite out of countenance and insulted you with their pity for being modestBut you own that he had emotion too when he first opened his mind to youWhat a duce would the girl haveOrme and Fowler in your head no doubt The tremblings of rejected men and the phantasies of romantic women were to be a rule to my brother I suppose with your mockmajestyAh Harriet Did I not say that we women are very silly creaturesBut my brother is a  good  manSo we must have something to find fault with him forHah hah hah hah What do you laugh at CharlotteWhat do I laugh at HarrietWhy at the idea of a couple of  Loveyers  taken each with a violent aguefit at their first approach to each otherHands shakingKnees tremblingLips quiveringTongue faulteringTeeth chatteringI had a good mind to present you with an aguedialogue between such a trembling coupleI I I I says the LoverYou you you you says the girl if able to speak at all But Harriet you shall have the whole on demand Rave at me if you will But Love as it is called by boys and girls shall ever be the subject of my ridicule Does it not lead us girls into all manner of absurdities inconveniencies undutifulness disgraceVillainous CupidityIt does  To be seriousNeither does my brother address you in a stile that impeaches either his own understanding or yoursAnother fault Harriet is it notBut sure you are not so  very  a girl  The justice he does to Lady Clementina and her family Let me be very serious when I speak of Clementina is a glorious instance as well of his greatness of mind as of his sincerity He has no need to depreciate one Lady to help him to exalt or do justice  I should rather say to another By praising her he makes noble court to you in supposing you as you are one of the most generous of women How great is his compliment to  both  Ladies when he calls Clementina the Miss Byron of Italy Who my dear ever courted woman as my brother courts you Indeed there can be but very few men who have such a woman to court  He suffers you not to ask for an account of the state of his heart from the time he knew you first till now He gives it to you unasked And how glorious is that account both to you and himself  Let us look back upon his conduct when last in Italy and when every step seemed to lead to his being husband of another woman  The recovery of Clementina and of her noble brother seem to be the  consequence  of his friendly goodness The grateful family all join to reward him with their darling's hand her heart supposed to be already his He like the man of honour he is concludes himself bound by his former offers They accept him upon those terms The Lady's merits thine out with transcendent lustre in the eyes of every one even of us his sisters and of  you  Harriet and your best friends Must they not in  his  to whom  Merit  was ever the  first Beauty  but the  second  attractive He had no tie to any other woman on earth He had only the tenderness of his own heart with regard to Miss Byron to contend with  Ought  he not to have contended with it He  did  and so far conquered as to enable himself to be  just  to the Lady whose great qualities and the concurrence of her friends in his favour had converted Compassion for her into Love And who that hear her story can forbear to Love her But with what tenderness with what politeness does he in his Letter to his chosen correspondent express himself of Miss Byron He declares that if  she  were not to be happy it would be a great abatement  of his own felicity You however remember how politely he recals his apprehensions that you may not on his account be altogether so happy as he wishes as the suggestions of his own presumption and censures himself for barely supposing that he had been of consequence enough with you to give you pain  How much to your honour before he went over does he account for your smiles for yourfrankness of heart in his company He would not build upon them Nor indeed could he know the state of your heart as  we  did He had not the opportunity How silly was your punctilio that made you sometimes fansy it was out of mere compassion that he revealed to you the state of his engagement abroad You see he tells you that such was his opinion of your greatness of mind that he thought he had no other way but to put it in your power to check him if his Love for you should stimulate him to an act of neglect to the Lady to whom she having never refused him and not being then in a condition either to claim him or set him free he thought himself under obligation Don't you revere him for his honour to her the nature of her malady considered What must he have suffered in this conflict  Well and now by a strange turn in the Lady but glorious to herself as he observes the obstacle removed he applies to Miss Byron for her favour How sensible is he of what delicacy requires from her How justly respecting his Love for you does he account for not postponing for the sake of  cold  and  dull  form as he justly expresses it his address to you How greatly does the Letter he delivered to you favour his argument Ah the poor Clementina  Cruel  persuades her relations I hate and pity them in a breath Never before did hatred and pity meet in the same bosom as they do in mine on this occasion His difficulties my dear and the uncommon situation he is in as if he were offering you but a divided Love  enhance your glory You are reinstated on the Female throne to the lowermost footstep of which you once was afraid you had descended You are offered a man whose perplexities have not proceeded from the entanglements of intrigue inconstancy perfidy but from his own compassionate nature And could you by any other way in the world than by this supposed divided Love have had it in your power by accepting his humblyoffered hand to lay him under obligation to you which he thinks he never shall be able to discharge Lay  him  WhoSir CHARLES GRANDISONFor whom so many virgin hearts have sighed in vainAnd what a triumph to our Sex is this as well as to my Harriet  And now Harriet let me tell you that my sister and I are both in great expectations of your next Letter It is it must be written before you will have this My brother is more than man You have only to shew yourself to be superior to the  forms  of woman If you play the fool with him now that you have the power you and we have so long wished you if you give pain to his noble because sincere heart by any the least shadow of Female affectation you who have hitherto been distinguished for so amiable a frankness of heart you who cannot doubt his honourthe honour of a man who solicits your favour in even a  great  manner a manner in which no man before him ever courted a woman because few men before him have ever been so particularly circumstanced a manner that gives you an opportunity to outshine in your acceptance of him even the noble Clementina in her refusal as bigotry must have been in part her motive if I say you act foolishly weakly nowLook to itYou will depreciate if not cast away your own glory Remember you have a man to deal with who from our behaviour to Mrs Oldham at his first return to England took measure of our minds and without loving us the less for it looked  down upon us with pity and made us ever since look upon ourselves in a diminishing light and as sisters who have greater reason to glory in their brother than he has in them Would you not rather you who are to stand in a still nearer relation to him invite his admiration than his pity Till Friday night last you had it What Saturday has produced we shall soon guess  Not either Lord L or Lord G not Emily not aunt Eleanor now either see or hear read what you write except hereandthere a passage which you yourself would not scruple to hear read to them Are you not our third sister To each of us our next Self And what gives you still more dignity the elected wife of our brother  Adieu my love In longing expectation of your next we subscribe  Your affectionate  CAROLINE L  CHARLOTTE G  LETTER XXI  Miss  BYRON  To Lady  G  Saturday Oct    MR Fenwick has just now been telling us from the account given him by that Greville vile man how the affair was between him and Sir Charles Grandison Take it briefly as follows  About Eight yesterday morning that audacious wretch went to the George at Northampton and after making his enquiries demanded an audience of Sir Charles Grandison Sir Charles was near dressed and had ordered his chariot to be ready with intent to visit us early  He admitted of Mr Greville's visit Mr Greville confesses that his own behaviour was  peremptory  his  word for  insolent  I suppose I hear Sir said he that y  u are come down into this country in order to carry off from u the richest jewel in itI need not say whom My name is Greville I have long made my addresses to her and have bound myself under a vow that were a Prince to be my competitor I would dispute his title to her  You seem to be a  princely  man Sir said Sir Charles offended with his air and words no doubt You need not Mr Greville have told me your name I have heard of you What  your  pretensions are I know not your vow is nothing to me I am master of my own actions and shall not account to you or any man living for them  I presume Sir you came down with the intention I have hinted at I beg only your answer as to that I beg it a favour gentleman to gentleman  The manner of your address to me Sir is not such as will intitle you to an answer for your  own  sake I will tell you however that I am come down to pay my devoirs to Miss Byron I hope for acceptance and know not that I am to make allowance for the claim of any man on earth  Sir Charles Grandison I know your character I know your bravery It is from that knowlege that I consider you as a sit man for me to talk to I am not a Sir Hargrave Pollexfen Sir  I make no account of  who  or  what  you are Mr Greville Your visit is not at this time a welcome one I am going to breakfast with Miss Byron I shall be here in the evening and at leisure then to attend to anything you shall think yourself authorized to say to me on this or any other subject  We may be overheard SirShall I beg you to walk with me into the garden below You are going to breakfast you say with Miss Byron  Dear  Sir Charles Grandison oblige me with an audience of five minutes only in the backyard or garden  In the evening Mr Greville command me anywhere But I will not be broken in upon now  I will not leave you at liberty Sir Charles to make your visit where you are going till I am gratified with one five minutes conference with you below  Excuse me then M Greville that I give orders as if you were not here Sir Charles ran Up came one of his servantsIs the chariot readyAlmost ready was the answerMake haste Saunders may see his friends in this neighbourhood He may stay with them till Monday Frederick and you attend me  He took out a Letter and read in it as he walked about the room with great composure not regarding Mr Greville who stood swelling as he owned at one of the windows till the servant withdrew and then he addressed himself to Sir Charles in language of reproach on this contemptuous treatmentMr Greville said Sir Charles you may be thankful perhaps that you are in my own apartment This intrusion is a very ungentlemanly one  Sir Charles was angry and expressed impatience to be gone Mr Greville owned that he knew not how to contain himself to see his rival with so many advantages in his person and air dressed avowedly to attend the woman he had so longShall I say been troublesome to For I am sure he had never the shadow of countenance from me  I repeat my demand Sir Charles of a conference of five minutes below  You have no right to make any demand upon me Mr Greville If you think you have the evening will be time enough But even then you must behave more like a gentleman than you have done hitherto to intitle youself to be considered as on a foot with me  Not on a foot with you SirAnd he put his hand upon his sword A gentleman is on a foot with a Prince Sir in a point of honour  Go then and find out your prince Mr Greville I am no Prince And you have as much reason to address yourself to the man you never saw as to me  His servant just then shewing himself and withdrawing Mr Greville added he I leave you in possession of this apartment Your servant Sir In the evening I shall be at your command  One word with you Sir CharlesOne word  What would Mr Greville turning back  Have you made proposals Are your proposals accepted  I repeat that you ought to have behaved differently Mr Greville to be intitled to an answer to these questions  Answer me however Sir I beg it as a favour  Sir Charles took out his watchAfter Nine I shall make them wait But thus I answer you I  have  made proposals and as I told you before I hope I shall he accepted  Were you any other man in the world Sir the man before you might question your success with a woman whose difficulties are augmented by the obsequiousness of her admirers But such a man as you would not have come down on a fool's errand I love Miss Byron to distraction I could not shew my face in the county and suffer any man out of it to carry away such a prize  Out of the county Mr Greville What narrowness is this But I pity you for your Love of Miss Byron And  You  pity  me Sir interrupted heI bear not such haughty tokens of superiority Either give up your pretensions to Miss Byron or make me sensible of it in the way of a gentleman  Mr Greville your servant And he went down  The wretch followed him and when they came to the yard and Sir Charles was stepping into the chariot he took his hand several persons presentWe  are observed Sir Charles whispered he Withdraw with me for a few moments By the great God of Heaven you must not refuse me I cannot bear that you should go thus triumphantly on the business you are going upon  Sir Charles suffered himself to be led hy the wretch And when they were come to a private spot Mr Greville drew and demanded Sir Charles to do the like putting himself in a posture of defence  Sir Charles put his hand on his sword but drew it not Mr Greville said he know your own safety and was turning from him when the wretch swore he would admit of no alternative but his giving up his pretensions to Miss Byron  His rage as Mr Fenwick describes it from himself making him dangerous Sir Charles drewI only defend myself said heGreville you keep no guardHe put by his pass with his sword and without making a push closed in with him twisted his sword out of his hand and pointing his own to his breast You see my power SirTake your life and your swordBut if you are either wise or would be thought a man of honour tempt not again your fate  And am I again master of my sword and unhurt 'Tis generousThe evening you say  Still I say I will be yours in the evening either at your own house or at my inn but not as a Duellist Sir You know my principles  How can this be and he sworeHow was it done Expose me not at Selbyhouse How the devil could this beI expect you in the evening here  And he went off a backway Sir Charles instead of going directly into his chariot went up to his apartment wrote his Billet to my aunt to excuse himself finding it full late to get hither in time and being somewhat discomposed in his temper as he owned to us And then he took an airing in his chariot till he came hither to dine  But how should we have been alarmed had we known that Sir Charles declined supping here in order to meet the violent man again at his inn And how did we again blame ourselves for taking amiss his not supping with us  Mr Fenwick says that Mr Greville got  him  to accompany him to the George  Sir Charles apologized with great civility to Mr Greville for making him wait for him Mr Greville had he been disposed for mischief had no use of his rightarm It was sprained by the twisting of his sword from it and in a sling  Sir Charles behaved to them both with great politeness and Mr Greville owned that he had acted nobly by him in returning his sword even before his passion was calmed and in not using his own But it was some time it seems before he was brought into this temper And what a good deal contributed to it was Sir Charles's acquainting him that he had not given particulars at Selbyhouse or to anybody of the fray between them but referred it to himself to give them as he should think proper This forbearance he highly applauded and was even thankful for it Fenwick shall in confidence said he report this matter to your honour and my own mortification as the truth requires at Selbyhouse Let me not be hated by Miss Byron on this account My passion gave me disadvantage I will try to honour you Sir Charles But I must hate you if you succeed One condition however I make That you reconcile me to the Selbys and Miss Byron and if you are likely to be successful let me have the credit of reporting that it is by my consent  They parted with civility but not it seems till a late hour Sir Charles as Mr Beauchamp and Dr Bartlett have told us was always happy in making by his equanimity generosity and forgiveingness fast  friends of inveterate enemies Thank God the issue was not unhappy  Mr Fenwick says that the rencounter is very little guessed at or talked of Thank God for that too and to those few who have enquired of Mr Greville or Mr Fenwick about it it has been denied and now Greville as Mr Fenwick had done before declares he will give out that he yields up all his hopes of Miss Byron but says that Sir Charles Grandison of whose address everybody already talks is the only man in England to whom he could resign his pretensions  He insists upon Sir Charles's dining with him tomorrow Mr Fenwick's also Sir Charles is so desirous that the neighbourhood should conclude that he and these gentlemen are on a foot of good understanding that he made the less scruple for everyone's sake to accept of his invitation  I am very very thankful my dearest Lady G that the constant blusterings of this violent man for so many months past are so happily overblown  Mr Fenwick as I guessed he would made proposals to my aunt and me for my Lucy Lucy has a fine fortune But if she had not he shall not have her Indeed he is not worthy of Lucy's mind He must be related to  me  he said But I answered No man must call Lucy Selby his who can have any other motive for his wishes but her merit  We hourly expect your brother The new danger he has been in on my account endears him still more to us all How how will you forbear said my uncle throwing yourself in his arms at once when he demands the result of our deliberations If I follow Mr Deane's advice I am to give him my hand at the  first  word If Lucy's and Nancy's he is not to ask me  twice  If my grandmamma's and aunt's They are always good I am to act as occasion requires and  as my own confidedin prudence will suggest at the time but to be sure not to be guilty of affectation But still my dear Ladies something sticks with me and ought it not in relation to the noble Clementina  LETTER XXII  Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Saturday Night Oct    NOW my dear Ladies L and G let me lay before you just as it happened for your approbation or censure all that has passed between the best of men and your Harriet Happy shall I be If I can be acquitted by his sisters  My grandmamma went home last night but was here before Sir Charles yet he came a little after Eleven We were all in the great parlour when he came He addressed us severally with his usual politeness and my grandmother particularly with such an air of reverence as did himself credit because of her years and wisdom  We all congratulated him on what we had heard from Mr Fenwick  Mr Greville and I said he are on every good terms When I have the presumption to think  myself  a welcome guest I am to introduce him as my friend Mr Greville tho' so long your neighbour modestly doubts his own welcome  Well he may said my aunt Selby afterNo  afters  dear madam if you mean anything that has passed between him and me  He again addressed himself to me I rejoice Sir said I that you have quieted so happily a spirit always thought uncontroulable  You must tell me madam replyed he when I can be allowed to introduce Mr Greville to you  Shall  I  answer for my cousin said LucyI did not Sir Charles think you such a designerYou were not you know to introduce Mr Greville till you were assured of being yourself a  very  welcome guest to my cousin  I own my plot replied he I had an intent to surprise Miss Byron into an implied favour to myself  You need not Sir Charles thought I take such a method  On his taking very kind notice of my cousin James Do you know Sir Charles said my uncle whose joy when it overflows seldom suffers the dear man to consult seasonableness that that boy is already in Love with your EmilyThe youth blushed  I am obliged to everybody who loves my Emily She is a favourite of Miss ByronMust she not then be a good girl  She is indeed a favourite said I and so great a one that I know not  who  can deserve her  I said this lest Sir Charles should think on a supposition that my uncle meant something that my cousin had  my  countenance  Sir Charles then addressed himself to my grandmamma and aunt speaking lowI hope Ladies I may be allowed in your presence to resume the conversation of yesterday with Miss Byron  No Sir Charles answered my grandmamma affecting to look serious that must not be  Must not be  madam and he seemed surprised and  affected  too My aunt was a little startled but not so much as she would have been had she not known the lively turns which that excellent parent sometimes gives to subjects of conversation  Must not be  I repent Sir Charles But I will not suffer you to be long in suspense We have always when proposals of this kind have been made referred ourselves to our Harriet She has prudence She has gratitude We will leave her and you together when  she is inclined to hear you on the interesting subject I know I am right Harriet is above disguises She will be obliged to speak for herself when she has not either her aunt or me to refer to She and you are not acquaintance of yesterday You Sir I dare say will not he displeased with the opportunity  Neither Miss Byron nor I madam could wish for the absence of two such parental relations But this reference I will presume to construe as a hopeful prognostic May I  now  through your mediation madam  to my aunt  hope for the opportunity of addressing myself to Miss Byron  My aunt taking me to the window told me what had passed I was a little surprised at my grandmamma's reference to myself only I expostulated with my aunt It is plain▪ madam that Sir Charles expected not this compliment  Your grandmamma's motion surprised me a little my dear It proceeded from the fulness of her joy She meant a compliment to you both There is now no receding Let us withdraw together  What madam at  his  proposal As if  expecting  to be followedSee how my uncle looks at me Every one's eyes are upon meIn the afternoon if it must beas by accident But I had rather you and my grandmamma were to be present I mean not to be guilty of affeciation to him I know my own heart and will not disguise it I shall  want  to refer to you I shall be silly I dare not trust myself  I wish the compliment had not been made replied my aunt But my dear come along with me  She went out I followed her a little reluctantly however and Lucy tells me that I looked so silly as was enough of itself to inform everybody of the intent of my withdrawing and that I expected Sir Charles would follow me  She was very cruel I told her and in my case would have looked as silly as I while  I  should have pitied  her  I led to my closet My aunt seating me there was going from me Well madam and so I am to stay here quietly I suppose till Sir Charles vouchsafes to come Would Clementina have done so  No hint to him of Clementina in this way I charge you It would look ungrateful and girlish I will introduce him to you  And stay with me I hope madam when he is introduced I tell you Lady G all my foibles Away went my aunt but soon returned and with her the man of men  She but turned herself round and saw him take my hand which he did with a compliment that would have made me proud at another time and left us together  I was resolved then to assume all my courage and if possible to be present to myself He  was  to himself yet had a modesty and politeness in his manner which softened the dignity of his address  Some men I fancy would have begun with admiring or pretending to admire the pieces of my own workmanship which you have seen hang here But not he After another compliment made as I presume to reassure me on my restored complexion I did indeed feel my face glow he spoke directly to his subject  I need not I am sure said he repeat to my dear Miss Byron what I said yesterday as to the delicacy of my situation with regard to what some would deem a divided or double Love I need not repeat to you the very great regard I have and ever shall have for the Lady abroad Her merit and your greatness of mind render any apology for so just a regard needless But it may be necessary to say what I can with truth say that I love not my own Soul better than I love Miss Byron You see madam I am wholly free with regard to that Ladyfree by her own choice by her own willYou see that the whole family build  a part of their happiness on the success of my address to a Lady of my own country Clementina's wish always was that I would marry and only be careful that my choice should not disgrace the regard she vouchsafed to own for me Clementina when she has the pleasure of knowing the dear Lady before me if that  may  be by the name of Grandison will confess that my choice has done the highest credit to the favour she honoured me with  And will you not my dear Lady G be ready to ask Could Sir Charles Grandison be really in earnest in this humble court as if he doubted her favour to a creature every wish of whose heart was devoted to him Did he not rather for his own sake in order to give her the consequence which a wife of his ought to have resolve to dignify the poor girl who had so long been mortified by cruel suspense and who had so often despaired of ever being happy with the Lord of her heart O no my dear your brother  looked  the humble the modest Lover yet the man of sense of dignity in Love I could not but be assured of his affection notwithstanding all that had passed And what  had  passed that he could possibly have helpedHis pleas of the day before the contents of Signor Jeronymo's Letter were all in my mind  He seemed to expect my answer He only whose generously  doubting  eye kept down mine can tell how I looked how I behavedBut hesitatingly tremblingly both voice and knees as I sat thus brokenly as near as I remember I answered not withdrawing my hand tho' as I spoke he more than once pressed it with his lipsThe honour of Sir Charles GrandisonSir Charles Grandison's honourno one ever did or ever can doubtI must ownI must confessThere I paused  What does my dear Miss Byron ownWhat confessAssure yourself madam of my honour of my gratitudeShould you have  doubts  speak them I  desire your favour but as I clear up your doubts I  would  speak them for youI  have  spoken them for you I own to you madam that there may be force in your doubts which nothing but your generosity and affiance in the honour of the man before you can induce you to get over And thus far I will own against myself that were the Lady in whose heart I should hope an interest to have been circumstanced as I was my own delicacy would have been hurt owing indeed to the high notion I have of the true Female delicacyNow say now  own  now  confess  my dear Miss Byronwhat you were going to  confess  This Sir is my confessionand it is the confession of a heart which I hope is as sincere as your ownThat I am dazled confounded shall I say at the superior merits of the Lady you so nobly so like yourself glory still in esteeming as she well deserves to be esteemed  Joy seemed to flash from his eyesHe bowed on my hand and pressed it with his lips but was either silent by choice or could not speak  I proceeded tho' with a hesitating voice a glowing cheek and downcast eyesI fear not Sir any more than  she  did your honour your Justice no nor your indulgent tenderness  Your  character  your  principles Sir are full security to the woman who shall endeavour to deserve from you that indulgenceBut so justly high do I think of Lady Clementina and her conduct that I fearah Sir I fearthat it is impossible  I stoptI am sure I was in earnest and must  look  to be so or my countenance and my heart were not allied  What  impossible  What fears my dear Miss Byron is  impossible  Why thus kindly urged and by a man of unquestionable honour shall I not speak all that is in my  mind The poor Harrier Byron fears she  justly  fears when she contemplates the magnanimity of that exalted Lady that with all her care with all her endeavours she never shall be able to make the figure to HERSELF which is necessary for her own tranquillity however  you  might generously endeavour to  assure  her doubting mind This Sir is my doubtAnd  all  my doubt  Generous kind noble Miss Byron in a rapturous accentAnd is this  all  your doubt Then must yet the man before you be a happy man for he questions not if life be lent him to make you one of the happiest of women Clementina has acted gloriously in preferring to all other considerations her Religion and her Country I can allow this in her favour against myself And shall I not be doubly bound in gratitude to her sisterexcellence who having not those trials yet the most delicate of human minds shews in my favour a frankness of heart which sets her above little forms and affectation and at the same time a generosity with regard to the merits of another Lady which has few examples  He then on one knee taking my passive hand between both his and kissing it once twice thriceRepeat dear and everdear Miss Byron that this is  all  your doubt I bowed assentingly I could not speakA happy an easy task is mine Be assured dearest madam that I will disavow every action of my life every thought of my heart every word of my mouth which tends not to dissipate that doubt  I took out my handkerchief  My dear Miss Byron proceeded he with an ardour that bespoke his heart you are goodness itself I approached you with diffidence with  more  than diffidence with apprehension because of your known delicacy which I was afraid on this occasion would  descend  into punctiliousnessMy blessings attend my future life as my grateful heart shall acknowlege this goodness  Again he kissed my hand rising with dignity I could have received his vows on my knees but I was motionless yet I had joy to be enabled to give him joyJoy to your brother to Sir Charles Grandison  He saw me greatly affected and indeed my emotion increased on reflection He considerately said I will leave you my dear Miss Byron to intitle myself to the congratulations of all our friends below From this moment after a thousand suspences and strange events which unsought for have chequered my past life I date my happiness  He most respectfully left me  I was glad he did Yet my eyes followed him His very shadow was grateful to me as he went downstairs And there it seems he congratulated himself and called for the congratulations of every one present in so  noble  a manner that every eye run over with joy  Was I not right said my grandmamma to my aunt You halfblamed me my dear in leaving Sir Charles and my Harriet together Harriet ever was above disguise Sir Charles might have  guessed  at her heart but he would not have  known  it from her own lips had she had you and me to refer to  Whatever  you  do madam answered my aunt must be right  My aunt came up to me She found me in a very thoughtful mood I had sometimes been accusing myself of forwardness and at others was acquitting myself or endeavouring to do soyet mingling tho' thus early a hundred delightful circumstances with my accusations and acquittals which were likely to bless my future lot Such as his relations and friends being mine mine his and I run them over all by name But my Emily my dear Emily I considered as  my  ward as well as his In this way my aunt found me She embraced me applauded me and  cleared up all my selfdoubtings as to forwardness and told me of their mutual congratulations below and how happy I had made them all What selfconfidence did her approbation give meAnd as she assured me that my uncle would not railly but extol me I went down with spirits much higher than I went up with  Sir Charles and my grandmamma were talking together sitting side by side when I entered the room All the company stood up at my entranceO my dear what a Princess in every one's eye will the declared Love of such a man make me How will all the consequence I had before among my partial friends and favourers be augmented  My uncle said  sideling  by me kindly intending not to dash me My sweet sparkler That was the name he used to call me before Sir Charles Grandison taught me a lesson that made me thoughtful You are now again my delight and my joy I thank you for not beinga foolthat's all Egad I was afraid of your  Femality  when you came face to face  Sir Charles came to me and with an air of the most respectful love taking my hand led me to a seat between himself and my grandmamma  My everdear Harriet said she and condescended to lift up my hand to her lips I will not abash you but must just say that you have acquitted yourself as I wished you to do I knew I could trust to a heart that ever was above affectation or disguise  Sir Charles Grandison madam said I has the generosity to distinguish and encourage a doubting mind  Infinitely obliging Miss Byron replied he pressing one hand between both his as my grandmamma held the other your condescension attracts both my Love and Reverence Permit me to say That had not Heaven given a Miss Byron for the object of my hope I had hardly after what had befallen me  abroad  ever looked forward to a wedded Love  One favour I have to beg of you Sir resumed my grandmamma It is that you will never use the word  abroad  or express  persons  by their  countries  in fine that you will never speak with reserve when the admirable Clementina is in your thoughts Mention her name with freedom my dear Sir to my child to me and to my daughter Selbyyou mayWe always loved and reverenced her Still we do so She has given an example to all her Sex of a passion properly subduedOf temporal considerations yielding to eternal  Sir said I bowing as I sat I join in this request  His eyes glistened with grateful joy He bowed low to each but spoke not  My aunt came to us and sat down by Sir Charles refusing his seat because it was next me Let me said she enjoy your conversation I have heard part of your subject and subscribe to it with all my heart Lady G can testify for us all three that we cannot be so mean as to intend you a compliment Sir by what has been said  Nor can I madam as to imagine it You exalt  yourselves  even more than you do Clementina I will let my Jeronymo know some of the particulars which have given joy to  my  heart They will make  him  happy and the excellent Clementina I will  not  forbear her name will rejoice in the happy prospects before me She wanted but to be assured that the friend she so greatly honoured with her regard was not likely either in the qualities of the Lady's mind or in her familyconnections to be a sufferer by her declining his address  May nothing now happen my dear Lady G to overcloudBut I will not be apprehensive I will thankfully enjoy the present moment and leave the future to the Allwise Diposer of events If Sir Charles Grandison be mine and reward by his kindness my Love what can befal  me that I ought not to bear with resignation  But my dear Ladies let me here ask you a question or two  Tell me Did I ever as you remember suffer by suspenses by  any  thingWas there ever really such a man as Sir Hargrave PollexfenDid I not tell you my  dreams  when I told you of what I believed I had undergone from his persecuting insults It is well for the sake of preserving to me the grace of humility and for the sake of warning for all my days  preceding  that insult had been happy that I wrote down  at the time  an account of those sufferings those sufferings or I should have been apt to forget now that I ever was unhappy  And pray let me ask Ladies Can you guess what is become of my illness I was very ill you know when you Lady G did us the honour of a visit so ill that I could not hide it from you and my other dear friends as fain I would have done I did not think it was an illness of such a nature as that its cure depended on an easy heart I wa so much convinced of the merits of Lady Clementina and that no other woman in the world ought to be Lady Grandison that I thought I had pretty tolerably quieted my heart in that expectation I hope I brag not too soon But my dear I now see so easy so light so happythat I hardly know what's the matter with meBut I hope nobody will  find  the malady I have  lost  May no disappointed heart be invaded by it Let it not travel to Italy The dear Lady there has suffered enough from a worse malady Nor if it stay in the island let it come near the sighing heart of my Emily That dear girl shall be happy if it be in my power to make her so Pray Ladies tell her she shallNo but don't I will tell her so myself by the next post Nor let it I pray God attack Lady Anne S or any of the halfscore Ladies of whom once I was so unwilling to hear  Our discourse at table was on various subjects My cousin James was again very inquisitive after the principal courts and places of note in Italy  What pleasure do I hope one day to receive from the perusal if I shall be favoured with it of Sir Charles's LITERARY JOURNAL mentioned to Dr Bartlett in some of his Letters from Italy For it includes I presume a description of palaces cities cabinets of the curious diversions amusements customs of different nations How attentive were we all to the answers he made to my cousin James's questions My memory serves but for a few generals and those I will not trouble you with Sir Charles told my cousin that if he were determined on an excursion abroad he would furnish him with recommendatory Letters  Mr Greville and his insult were one of our subjects after dinner when the servants were withdrawn Lucy expressed her wonder that he was so soon reconciled to Sir Charles after the menaces he had for years past thrown out against any man who should be likely to succeed with me  My uncle observed that Mr Greville had not for a long time had any hopes that he always was apprehensive that if Sir Charles Grandison were to make his addresses he would succeed That it had been his and Fenwick's custom to endeavour to bluster away their competitors  See Vol Letter ii p  He possibly my uncle added might hope to intimidate Sir Charles or at least knowing his principles might suppose he ran no risque in the attempt  Mr Deane said Mr Greville had told him that the moment he knew Miss Byron had chosen her man he would give up his pretensions but that as long as she remained single he was determined to persecute her as he himself called it Perseverance he had  known do everything after an admired woman had run through her circle of humble servants and perhaps found herself disappointed in her own choice and for his part but with  her  he had no fondness for the married life he cared not who knew it  Sir Charles spoke of Mr Greville with candour He thought him a man of rough manners but not illnatured He affected to be a joker and often therefore might be taken for a worse man than he really was He believed him to be careless of his reputation and one who seemed to think there were wit and bravery in advancing free and uncommon things and gloried in bold surprizes For my part continued he I should hardly have consented to cultivate his acquaintance much less to dine with him tomorrow but as he insisted upon it as a token of my for giving in him a behaviour that wa  really what a gentleman should not have pardoned himself for I considered him proceed Sir Charles as a neighbour to this family with whom you had lived and perhaps chose to live upon good terms Bad neighbours are nuisances especially if they are people of fortune It is in the power of such to be very troublesome in their own  persons  and they will often let loose their  servants  to defy provoke insult and do mischief to those they love not Mr Greville I thought added he deserved to be the more indulged for the sake of his Love to Miss Byron He is a proud man and must be mortified enough in having it generally known that she had constantly rejected his suit  Why that's true said my uncle Sir Charles you consider everybody But I hope all's over between you  I have no doubt but it is Mr Selby Mr Greville's whole aim now seems to be to come off with as little abatement of his pride as possible He thinks if he can pass to the world as one who having no hope himself is desirous to pronounce the cause of his friend  as he will acknowledge me to be it will give him consequence in the eye of the world and be a gentle method of letting his pride down easy  Very well said my uncle and a very good contrivance for a proud man I think  It is an expedient of his friend Fenwick replied Sir Charles and Mr Greville is not a little fond of it And what Ladies and Gentlemen will you say if you should see me come to church tomorrow with him sit with him in the same pew and go with him to dinner in his coach It is his request that I will He thinks this will put an end to the whispers which have passed in spite of all his precaution of a rencounter between him and me For he has given out that he strained his wrist and arm by a fall from his horse Tell me dear Ladies shall I or shall I not oblige him in this request He is to be with me tonight for an answer  My grandmamma said that Mr Greville was always a very odd a very particular man She thought Sir Charles very kind to  us  in being so willing to conciliate with him My uncle declared that he was very desirous to live on good terms with all his neighbours particularly with Mr Greville a part of whose estate being intermixed with his it might be in his power to be vexations at least to his tenants Mr Deane thought the compromise was a happy one and he supposed entirely agreeable to Sir Charles's generous wishes to promote the good understanding of neighbours and to the compassion it was in his nature to shew to an unsuccessful rival  Sir Charles then turning to Lucy May I Miss Selby said he do you think without being too deep a  designer  ask leave of Miss Byron on the presumption of her goodness to me to bring Mr Greville to drink tea with her tomorrow in the afternoon  Your servant Sir Charles answered Lucy smiling But what say you cousin Byron to this question  This house is not mine replied I but I dare say I may be allowed the liberty in the names of my uncle and aunt to answer that any person will be welcome to Selbyhouse whom Sir Charles Grandison shall think proper to bring with him  Mr Greville said Sir Charles professes himself unable to see any of you Miss Byron in particular without an introductor He makes a high compliment to me when he supposes me to be a proper one If you give me leave bowing to my uncle and aunt I will answer him to his wishes and hope when he comes everything will be passed by in silence that happened between him and me  Two or three lively things passed between Lucy and Sir Charles on his repetition of her word  designer  She began with advantage but did not hold it yet he gave her consequence in the little debate at his own expence  My grandmamma will go to her own church but will be here at dinner and the rest of the day I have a thousand things more to say all agreeable but it is now late and a drowsy fit has come upon me I will welcome it Adieu adieu my dear Ladies Felicitate I am sure you will  Your everobliged everdevoted HARRIETT BYRON  LETTER XXIII  Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Sunday Noon Oct    WE were told there would be a crouded church this morning in expectation of seeing the new humble servant of Miss Byron attending her thither For it is everywhere known that Sir Charles Grandison is come down to make his addresses to the young creature who is happy in every one's love and good  wishes and all is now said to have been settled between him and us by his noble sister and Lord G and Dr Bartlett when they were with usAnd we are to be marriedO my dear Lady G you cannot imagine how soon You see what credit you did us by your kind visit my dear  Many of the neighbourhood seemed disappointed when they saw me led in by my uncle as Mr Deane led my aunt and Nancy and Lucy only attended by their brother But it was not long before Mr Greville Mr Fenwick and Sir Charles entered and went into the pew of the former which is overagainst ours Mr Greville and Mr Fenwick bowed low to us severally the moment they went into the pew and to several others of the gentry  Sir Charles had first other devoirs to pay To false shame you have said he was always superior I was delighted to see the example he set He paid us his second compliments with a grace peculiar to himself I felt my face glow on the whispering that went round I thought I read in every eye admiration of him even through the sticks of some of the Ladies fans  What a difference was there between the two men and him in their behaviour throughout both the service and sermon Yet who ever beheld two of the three so decent so atttentive so  reverent  I may say before Were all who call themselves gentlemen thought I more than once like  this  the world would yet be a good world  Mr Greville had his arm in a sling He seemed highly delighted with his guest so did Mr Fenwick When the sermon was ended Mr Greville held the pewdoor ready opened to attend our movements and when we were in motion to go he taking officiously Sir Charles's hand bent towards us Sir Charles met us at our pewdoor He approached us with that easy grace peculiar to himself and offered with a profound respect his hand to me  This was equal to a public declaration It took everybody's attention He is not ashamed to avow in public what he thinks fit to own in private  I was humbled more than exalted by the general notice Mr Greville bold yet low man made a motion as if he gave the hand that Sir Charles took Mr Fenwick offered his hand to Lucy Mr Greville led my aunt and not speaking low subtle as a serpent My plaguy horse said he looking at his sling knew not his master I invite myself to tea with you madam in the afternoon You will supply my lame arm I hope yourself  There is no such thing as keeping private one's movements in a countrytown if one would One of our servants reported the general approbation It is a pleasure surely my dear Ladies to be addressed to by a man of whom every one approves What a poor figure must she make who gives way to a courtship from a man whom everybody blames her for encouraging Such women indeed generally confess indirectly the solly by carrying on the affair clandestinely  Sunday Evening  O MY dear I have been strangely disconcerted by means of Mr Greville He is a strange man But I will lead to it in course  We all went to church again in the afternoon Everybody who knew Mr Greville took it for a high pie  e of politeness in him to his guest that he came twice the same day to church Sir Charles edified everybody by his chearful piety Are you not of opinion my dear Lady G that wickedness may be always put out of countenance by a person who has an established character for goodness and who is not ashamed of doing his duty in the public eye Methinks I could wish that all the prosligates in the parish had their seats around that of a man who has fortitude enough to dare to be good The text was a happy  one to this purpose The words of our Saviour  'Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy Angels'  Sir Charles conducted my aunt to her coach as Mr Greville officiously but properly for hi views did me We found Mr Fenwick at Selbyhouse talking to my grandmamma on the new subject She dined with us but not being very well chose to retire to her devotions in my closet while we went to church she having been at her own in the morning  We all received Mr Greville with civility He affects to be thought a wit you know and a great joker Some men cannot appear to advantage without making their friend a butt to shoot at Fenwick and he tried to play upon each other as usual Sir Charles lent each his smile and whatever he thought of them shewed not a contempt of their greatboy snipsnap But at last my grandmamma and aunt engaged Sir Charles in a conversation which made the gentlemen so silent and so attentive that had they not flashed a good deal at each other before one might have thought them a little discreet  Nobody took the least notice of what had passed between Mr Greville and Sir Charles till Mr Greville touched upon the subject to me He desired an audience of ten minutes as he said and upon his declaration that it was the last he would ever ask of me on the subject and upon my grandmamma's saying Oblige Mr Greville my dear I permitted him to draw me to the window  His address was nearly in the following words not speaking so low but every one might hear him tho' he said aloud Nobody must but me  I must account myself very unhappy madam in having never been able to incline you to shew me  favour You may think me vain I believe I am so But I may take to myself the advantages and qualities which everybody allows me I have an estate that will warrant my addresses to a woman of the first rank and it it is free and unincumbered I am not an illnatured man I love my jest 'tis true but I love my friend You good women generally do not like a man the less for having something to mend in him I could say a great deal more in my own behalf but that Sir Charles Grandison looking at him quite eclipses me Devil fetch me if I can tell how to think myself  any  thing before him I was always afraid of him But when I heard he was gone abroad in pursuit of a former Love I thought I had another chance for it  Yet I was halfafraid of Lord D His mother would manage a Machiavel He has a great estate a title he has good qualities for a nobleman But when I found that you could so steadily refuse him as well as me There must be some man thought I who is lord of her heart  Fenwick  is as sad a dog as I it cannot be he  Orme  poor soul she will not have such a milksop as that neither  Mr Orme Sir interrupted I and was going to praise himBut he said I will be heard out now This is my dying speech I will not be interrupted  Well then Sir smiling come to your last words as soon as you can  I have told you before now Miss Byron that I will not bear your smiles But now smiles or frowns I care not I have no hopes left and I am resolved to abuse you before I have done  Abuse me I hope not Sir  'Hope not' What signify  your  hopes who never gave me any But hear me out I shall say some thing that will displease you but more of another nature I went on guessing who could be the happy man That  second  Orme Fowler cannot be he  thought I Is it the newlyarrived Beauchamp He is a pretty fellow enough I had all your footsteps watched as I told you I would No answered I myself she refused Lord D and a whole tribe of us before Beauchamp came to EnglandWho the devil can he beBut when I heard that the dangerous man whom I hadt hought gone abroad to his matrimonial destiny was returned unmarried when I heard that he was actually coming northward I began to be again afraid of him  Last Thursday night I had intelligence that he was seen at Dunstable in the morning in his way towards us Then did my heart fail me I had my spies about Selbyhouse I own it What will not Love and Jealousy make a man do I understood that your uncle and Mr Deane and a tribe of servants for trainsake were set out to meet him How I raved How I cursed How I sworeThey will not surely thought I allow my rival at his  first  visit to take up his residence under the same roof with this charming Witch  Witch Mr Greville  Witch Yes Witch I called you ten thousand names in my rage all as bad as that Here Jack Will Tom George get ready instantly each a dozen firebrands I will light up Selbyhouse for a bonfire to welcome the arrival of the invader of my freehold And prongs and pitchforks shall be got ready to push every soul of the family back into the flames that not one of it may escape my vengeance  Horrid man I will hear no more  You must You shall It is my dying speech I tell you  A dying man should be penitent  To what purposeI can have no hope What is to be expected  for  or  from  a despairing manBut then I had intelligence brought me that my rival was not admitted to take up his abode with you This  saved Selbyhouse All my malice then was against the George at Northampton The keeper of it owes said I to myself a hundred thousand obligations to me yet to afford a retirement to my deadliest foeBut 'tis more manly thought I m person to call this invader to account▪ if he pretends an interest at Selbyhouse and to force him to relinquish his pretensions to the Queen of it as I had made more than one gallant fellow do before by dint of bluster  I slept not all that night In the morning I made my visit at the inn I pretend to know as well as any man what belongs to civility and good manners but I knew the character of the man I had to deal with I knew he was cool yet resolute My rage would not let me be civil and if it would I knew I must be rude to provoke him I  was  rude I was peremptory  Never was there such cold such phlegmatlc contempts passed upon man as he passed upon me I came to a point with him I heard he would not fight I was resolved he should I followed him to his chariot I got him to a private place but I had the devil and no man to deal with He cautioned me by way of insult as I took it to keep a guard I took his hint I had better not for he knew all the tricks of the weapon He was in with me in a moment I had no sword left me and my life was at the mercy of his He gave me up my own swordCautioned me to regard my safetyPut up his withdrewI found myself sensible of a damnable strain I had no rightarm I slunk away like a thief He mounted his triumphal car and pursued his course to to the Lady of Selbyhouse I went home cursed swore fell down and bit the earth  My uncle looked impatient Sir Charles seemed in suspense but attentive Mr Greville proceeded  I got Fenwick to go with me to attend him at night by appointment Cripple as I was I would  have provoked him He would not be provoked And when I found that he had not exposed me at Selbyhouse when I remembered that I owed my sword and my life to his moderation when I recollected his character what he had done by Sir Hargrave Pollexfen what Bagenhall had told me of him Why the plague thought I should I hopeless as I am of succeeding with my charming Byron whether  he  lives or dies set my face against such a man He is incapable either of insult or arrogance Let me Fenwick advised a scheme let me make him my friend to save my pride and the devil take the rest Harriet Byron and all  Wicked manYou was dying a thousand words agoI am sick of you  You have not madam heard half my dying words yetBut I would not terrify youAre you terrified  Indeed I am  Sir Charles motioned as if he would approach us but kept his place on my grandmamma's saying Let us hear his humour out Mr Greville was always particular  Terrified madam What is  your  being terrified to the sleepless nights to the tormenting days you have given me Cursing darkness cursing light and most myselfO madam with shut teeth What a torment of torments have you been to meWell but now I will hasten to a conclusion in mercy to you who however never shewed me any  I never was cruel Mr Greville  But you was and most cruel when most sweettempered It was to that smiling obligingness that I owed my ruin That gave me hope that radiance of countenance and that frozen heartO you are a dear deceiverBut I hasten to conclude my dying speechGive me your handI will have it  I will not eat it  as once I had like to have done  'And now madam hear my parting wordsYou will  have the glory of giving to the best of men the best of wives Let it not be long before you do for the sake of many who will hope on till then As your  Lover  I must hate him As your  Husband  I will love him He will he must be kind affectionate grateful to you and you will deserve all his tenderness May you live the ornaments of human nature as you are to see your children's children all promising to be as good as worthy as happy as yourselves And full of years full of honour in one hour may you be translated to that Heaven where only you can be more happy than you will be if you are both as happy as I wish and expect you to be'  Tears dropt on my cheek at this unexpected blessing so like that of the wicked prophet of old blessing where he was expected to curse  Balaam Numb xxii seq    He still held my handI will not without your leave madamMay I before I part with itHe looked at me as if for leave to kiss my hand bowing his head upon it  My heart was opened God bless you Mr Greville as you have blessed meBe a good man and he willI withdrew not my hand  He kneeled on one knee eagerly kissed my hand more than once Tears were in his own eyes He arose hurried me to Sir Charles and holding to him my then through surprise halfwithdrawn handLet me have the pride the glory Sir Charles Grandison to quit this dear hand to yours It is only to yours that I would quit it  Happy happy happy pairNone but the brave deserves the fair    Sir Charles took my handLet this precious present be mine said he kissing it mine with the declared assent of every one here and presented me to my grandmamma and aunt I was frighted by the hurry the strange man had put me into  May I  but  live to see her yours Sir said my grandmamma in a kind of rapture  The moment he had put my hand into Sir Charles's he ran out of the room with the utmost precipitation He was gone quite gone when he came to be enquired after and everybody was uneasy for him till we were told by one of the servants that he took from the window of the outward parlour his hat and sword and by anotehr that he met him his servant after him hurrying away and even sobbing as he flewWas there ever so strange a man  Don't you pity Mr Greville my dear  Sir Charles was generously uneasy for him  Mr Greville said Lucy who had always charity for him has frequently surprised us with his particularities but I hope from the last part of his behaviour that he is not the freethinking man he sometimes affects to be thought I flatter myself that Sir Charles had a righter notion of him than we in what he said of him yesterday  Sir Charles waited on my grandmamma home so we had him not to supper We are all to dine with her tomorrow Your brother you may suppose will be a principal guest  Monday Morning Oct    I HAVE a Letter from my Emily by which I find she is with you tho' she has not dated it You was very kind in shewing the dear girl the overflowings of my heart in her favour She is all grateful love and goodness I will soon write to her to repeat my assurances that my whole power shall always be exerted to do her pleasure But you must tell her as from yourself that she must have patience I cannot ask her guardian such a question as she puts as to her living with me till I am likely to  succeed  Would the sweet girl have me make a request to him that shall shew him I am supposing myself to be his before I am so We are not come so far on our journey  by several stages And yet from what he intimated last night as he waited on my grandmamma to Shirleymanor I find that his expectations are forwarder than it will be possible for me to answer And I must without intending the least affectation for common decorumsake take the management of this point upon myself For my dear we are every one of us here so much in Love with him that the moment he should declare his wishes they would be as ready to urge me t oblige him were he even to limit me but to two or three days as if they were afraid he would not repeat his request  I have a Letter from Mr Beauchamp He writes that there are no hopes of Sir Harry's recovery I am very sorry for it He does me great honour to write to me to give him consolation His is a charming LetterSo full of silial pietyExcellent young man He breathes in it the true spirit of his  friend  Sir Charles and his Beauchamp and Dr Bartlett correspond I presume as usual What would I give to see all Sir Charles writes that relates to us  Mr Fenwick just now tells us that Mr Greville is not well and keeps his chamber He has my cordial wishes for his health His last behaviour to me appears the more I think of it more strange from such a man I expected not that he would conclude with such generous wishes Nancy who does not love him says that it was such an overstrain of generosity from him that it might well overset him Did you think that our meek Nancy could have said so severe a thing But meekness offended as she once was by him has an excellent memory and can be bitter  We are preparing now to go to Shirleymanor Our cousins Patty and Kitty Holles will be there at dinner They have been for a few weeks past at their aunt's near Daventry They are impatient to see  Sir Charles Adieu my dearest Ladies Continue to love  Your  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XXIV  Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Monday Night October    WE have been very happy this day at my grandmamma's Your brother makes himself more and more beloved by all my friends who yet declare that they thought they could not have loved him better than they did before My cousin Holles's say they could sooner lay open their hearts to him than to any man they ever saw yet their freedom would never make them lose sight of their respect  He told me that he had breakfasted with Mr Greville How does he conciliate the mind of every one to him He said kind and compassionate things of Mr Greville and  so  unaffectedlyI was delighted with him For regardful as he would be and is of his own honour no low narrow jealousy I dare say will ever have entrance into his heart  Charity thinketh no evil  Of what a charming text is that a part  Cor xiii  What is there equal to it in any of the writings of the philosophers  My dear Miss Byron said he to me Mr Greville loves you more than you can possibly imagine Despairing of success with you he has assumed airs of bravery but your name is written in large letters in his heart He gave me continued he the importance of asking my  leave  to love you stillWhat  ought  I to have answered  What  did  you answer Sir  That so far as I might presume to give it I gave it  Had I the honour added I of calling Miss Byron mine I would not barely  allow  your love of her I would  demand  itHave I not assured you Mr Greville that I look upon you as my  friend  You will quite subdue Mr Greville Sir said I You will by the generosity of your treatment of him do more than anybody else ever couldYou will make him a good man  Mr Greville madam deserves pity on more accounts than one A wife such a one as his good Angel led him to wish for would have settled his principles He wants steadiness But he is not I hope a bad man I was not concerned for his cavalier treatment of you yesterday but on your own account lest his roughness should give you pain But his concluding wishes and his preference of a rival to himself together with the manner of his departure unable as he was to withstand his own emotions and the effect it had upon his spirits so as to confine him to his chamber had something great in itAnd I shall value him for it as long as he will permit me  Sir Charles and my grandmamma had a good deal of talk together Dearly does she love to single him out What a pretty picture would they make could they be both drawn so as not to cause a  profane  jester to fall into mistakes as if it were an old Lady makeing Love to a handsome young man  Let me sketch it outSee then the dear Lady with a countenance full of benignity years written by venerableness rather than by wrinkles in her face dignity and familiarity in her manner one hand on his talking to him His sine countenance shining with modesty and reverence looking down delighted as admiring her wisdom and not a little regardful of her halfpointing finger Let that be for fear of mistakes to a creature young enough to be her granddaughter who to avoid shewing too much sensibility shall seem to be talking to two other young Ladies  Nancy and Lucy suppose but in order to distinguish the young creature let her with a blushing cheek cast a fly eye on the grandmamma and young gentleman while the other two shall not be afraid to look more free and unconcerned  See my dear how fanciful I am But I had a mind to tell you in a new manner how my grandmamma and Sir Charles seem to admire each other  Mr Deane and he had also some talk together my uncle joined them And I blushed in  earnest  at the subject I only  guessed  at from the following words of Mr Deane at Sir Charles's rising to come from them to my aunt and me who both of us sat in the bowwindow My dear Sir Charles Grandison said Mr Deane you love to give pleasure I never was so happy in my life as I am in view of this longwishedfor event You  must  oblige me I insist upon it  My aunt took it as I didA generous contention▪ said she O my dear we shall all be too happy God grant that nothing may fall out to disconcert us If there  should  how many broken hearts  The first broken one madam interrupted I would be the happiest I in that case should have the advantage of everybody  Dear love you are too serious Tears were in my eyes Sir Charles's unquestionable honour is our securityIf Clementina be stedfast if life and health be spared you and himIf  Dear dear madam no more  Ifs  Let there be but one  If  and that on Lady Clementina's resumption In that case I will submit and God only as indeed He always ought shall be my reliance for the rest of my life  Lucy Nancy and my two cousin Holles's came and spread two and two the other seats of the bowwindow there are but three with their vast hoops undoubtedly because they saw Sir Charles coming to  us It is difficult whispered I to my aunt petulantly enough to get him one moment to one's self My cousin James Silly youth thought I  stopt  him in his way to me but Sir Charles would not long be stopt He led the interrupter towards us and a seat not being at hand while the young Ladies were making a bustle to give him a place between them tossing their hoops above their shoulders on one side and my cousin James was hastening to bring him a chair he threw himself at the seet of my aunt and me making the floor his feat  I don't know how it was but I thought I never saw him look to more advantage His attitude and behaviour had such a Loverlike appearanceDon't you see him my dearHis amiable countenance  so  artless yet  so  obliging cast up to my aunt and me His fine eyes meeting ours mine particularly in their  own  way for I could not help looking down with a kind of proud bashfulness as Lucy told me afterwards How affected must I have appeared had I either turned my head aside or looked stiffly up to avoid his  I believe my dear we women in courtshp don't love that men if ever so wise should keep up to  us  the dignity of wisdom much less that they should be solemn formal graveYet are we fond of respect and observance tooHow is itSir Charles Grandison can tellDid you think of your brother Lady G when you once said that the man who would commend himself to the general favour of us young women should be a Rake in his address and a Saint in his heart Yet might you not have chosen a better word than  Rake  Are there not more clumsy and foolish Rakes than polite ones except we can be so mistaken as to give to impudence the name of agreeable freedom  Sir Charles sell immediately into the easiest shall I say the gallantest the most agreeable conversation as  if he must be all of a piece with the freedom of his attitude and mingled in his talk two or three very pretty humourous stories so that nobody thought of helping him again to a chair or wishing him in one  How did this little incident familiarize the amiable man as a still  more  amiable man than before to my heart In one of the little tales which was of a gentleman in Spain serenading his mistress we asked him if he could not remember a sonnet he spoke of as a pretty one He without answering sung it in a most agreeable manner and at Lucy's request gave us the English of it  It is a very pretty sonnet I will ask him for a copy and send it to you who understand the language  My grandmamma on Sir Charles's singing beckoned to my cousin James who going to her she whispered him He stept out and presently returned with a violin and struck up as he entered a minuettune Harriet my love▪ called out my grandmama Without any other intimation the most agreeable of men in an instant was on his feet reached his hat and took me out  How were we applauded How was my grandmamma delighted The words charming couple were whispered round but loud enough to be heard And when we had done he led me to my seat with an air that had all the real fine gentleman in it But then he sat not down as before  I wonder if Lady Clementina ever danced with him  My aunt at Lucy's whispered request proposed a dance between Sir Charles and her You Lady G observed more than once that Lucy dances finely Insulter  her when she had done you know  meHarriet replied she  when they speak against  My  called upon me for on  on  they made me sing  An admirable conversation followed at tea in which my grandmother aunt my Lucy and Sir Charles bore the chief parts every other person delighting to be silent  Had we not Lady G a charming day  In my next I shall have an opportunity perhaps to tell you what kind of a travelling companion Sir Charles is For be pleased to know that for some time past a change of air and a little excursion from place to place have been prescribed for the establishment of my health by one of the honestest physicians in England The day before Sir Charles came into these parts it was fixed that tomorrow we should set out upon this tour On his arrival we had thoughts of postponing it but having understood our intention he insisted upon its being prosecuted and offering his company there was no declining the favour you know  early  days as they however are And altho' every body abroad talks of the occasion of his visit to us he has been so far from directing his servants to make a secret of it that he has ordered his Saunders to answer to every curious questioner that Sir Charles and I were of longer acquaintance than yesterday But is not this my dear a cogent intimation that Sir Charles thinks some parade some delay necessary Yet don't  he  and  we  know how little a while ago it is that he made his first declaration What my dear should he be solicitous for an early day is the inference My uncle too so forward that I am afraid of him  We are to set out tomorrow morning Peterborough is to be our furthest stage one way Mr Deane insists that we shall pass two or three days with him All of us but my grandmamma are to be of his party  O MY dear Lady G what a Letter is just brought me by the hand that carried up mine on Saturday  Bless me what an answerThis wicked wishBut I have not time to enter into so large a field Let me only say That for some parts I most heartily thank you and dear Lady L for others I do not and imagine Lady L would not have subscribed her beloved name had she read the whole What charming spirits have you my dear dear Lady GBut Adieu my everamiable Ladies both  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XXV  Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Thrapston  Tuesday Even October    WE passed several hours at Boughton  The seat of the late Duke of Montagu  and arrived here in the afternoon Mr Deane had insisted that we should put up at a nephew's of his in the neighbourhood of this town The young gentleman met us at Oundle and conducted us to the house I have got such a habit of scribbling that I cannot forbear applying to my pen at every opportunity The less wonder when I have your brother for my subject and the two beloved sisters of that brother to write to  It would be almost impertinent to praise a man for his horsemanship who in his early youth was so noted for the performance of all his exercises that his Father and General W thought of the military life for him Ease and unaffected dignity distinguish him in all his accomplishments Bless me madam said Lucy to my aunt on more occasions than one this man is everything  Shall I own that I am retired to my pen just now from a very bad motive  Anger  I am in my heart even peevish with  all  my friends for clustering so about Sir Charles that he can hardly obtain a moment  which he seems to seek for too to talk with me alone My uncle He  does  dote upon him always inconsiderately stands in his way and can I say to a man so  very  inclinable to raillery that he should allow  me  more and  himself  less of Sir Charles's conversation I wonder my  aunt  does not give my uncle a hint But she loves Sir Charles's company as well as my uncle  This however is nothing to the distress my uncle gave me at dinner this day Sir Charles was observing upon the disposition of one part of the gardens at Boughton That Art was to be but the handmaid of NatureI have heard Sir Charle said my uncle that you have made that a rule with you at Grandisonhall With what pleasure should I make a visit there to  you and my niece    He stopt He  needed not  He might have said anything after this Sir Charles looked as if concerned for  me  yet said that would be a joyful visit to him My aunt was vexed for  my  sake Lucy gave my uncle  such  a look  My uncle afterwards indeed apologized to me  Adsheart  I was a little blunt I believe But what  a duce  need there be these niceties observed when you are  sure  I am sorry howeverBut it would outYet you Harriet made it worse by looking so silly  WHAT Lady G can I do with this dear man My uncle I mean He has been just making a proposal to me as he calls it and with such  honest  looks of forecast and wisdomLookye HarrietI shall be always blundering about your  scrupulosities  I am come to propose something to you that will put it out of my power to make mistakeI beg of you and your aunt to allow me to enter with Sir Charles into a certain subject and this not for your sakeI know you won't allow of thatBut for the  ease of Sir Charles's own heart  Gratitude is  my  motive and  ought to be  yours  I am sure he loves the very ground you tread upon  I besought him for  every  sake dear to himself not to interfere in the matter but to leave these subjects to my aunt and meConsider Sir said I  consider  how very lately the first personal declaration was made  I do I will consider everythingBut there is danger between the cup and the lip  Dear Sir my hands and eyes lifted up was all the answer I could make He went from me hastily muttering goodnaturedly against  Femalities  Deane's Grove  Wedn    MR DEANE'S pretty box you have seen Sir Charles is pleased with it We looked in at Fotheringaycastle  The prison of Mary Queen of Scots  Milton  The seat of Earl Fitzwilliams  c Mr Charles Deane a very obliging and sensible young gentleman attended his uncle all the way  What charming descriptions of fine houses and curiosities abroad did Sir Charles give us when we stopt to bait or to view the pictures furniture gardens of the houses we saw  In every place on every occasion on the road or when we alighted or put up he shewed himself so considerate so gallant so courteous to allow who approached him and  so  charitableYet not indiscriminately to everybody that asked him But he was bountiful indeed on representation of the misery of two honest families Beggars born or those who make begging a trade if in health and not lame or blind have seldom it seems any share in his munisicence But persons fallen from competence and such as struggle with some instant distress or have large families which they have not ability to maintain these and such as these are the objects of his bounty Richard Saunders who is sometimes his almoner  told my Sally that he never goes out but somebody is the better for him and that his  manner  of bestowing his charity is  such  as together with the poor peoples blessings and prayers for him often draws tears from his eyes  I HAVE overheard a dialogue that has just now passed between my uncle and aunt There is but a thin partition between the room they were in and mine and he spoke loud my aunt now low yet earnest only not angry He had been proposing to her as he had done to me to enter into a certain subject in pity to Sir Charles None had he for his poor niece No doubt but he thought he was obliging me and that my objection was only owing to  Femality  as he calls it a word I don't like I never heard it from Sir Charles  My aunt was not at all pleased with his motion She wished as  I  had done that he would not interfere in these  nice  matters He took offence at the exclusion because of the word  nice  She said He was too precipitating a great deal She did not doubt but Sir Charles would be full early in letting me know his expectations  She spoke more decisively than she is used to do He cannot bear her chidings tho' ever so gentle I need not tell you that he both loves and reveres her but as one of the lords of the creation is apt to be jealous of his prerogatives You used to be diverted with his honest particularities  What an  ignoramus  you women and girls make of me Dame Selby said he I know nothing of the world nor of men and women that's certain I am always to be  documented  by you and your  minxes  But the  duce  take your  niceties  You don't you can't poor souls as you are distinguish  men  You must all of you go on in one  rigmyroll  way in one beaten track Who the  duce  would have thought it  needful when a girl and we all were wishing till our very hearts were  bursting  for this man when he was not in his own power would think you must now come with your  hums  and your  haws  and the whole  circumroundabouts  of female nonsense to  stave off  the point your hearts and souls are set upon I remember Dame Selby tho' so long ago how  you  treated your future Lord and Master when you  prank'd  it as Lady and Mistress You vexed my very Soul I can tell you that And often and often when I left you I swore bitterly that I never would come again as a Lovertho' I was a poor forsworn wretchGod forgive me  My dear Mr Selby you should not remember past things You had very odd waysI was afraid for a good while of venturing with you at all  Now Dame Selby I have you at a  whynot  or I never had tho' by the way your  un  evenness increased my oddnessBut what oddness is in Sir Charles Grandison If he is not  even  neither you nor I were ever  odd  What reason is there for  him  to run the  Female gauntlope  I pity the excellent man remembering how I was formerly vexed myselfI hate this  shillyshally  fooling the  know yourmind  and  not  knowyourmind nonsense As I hope to  live and breathe  I'll I'll I'll blow you all up without  gunpowder  or  oatmeal  if an honest gentleman is thus to be fooled with and after such a Letter too from his friend Jeronymo in the names of the whole family Lady G for my money Ah thought I Lady G gives better advice than she even  wishes  to know how to take▪ I like her notion of parallel linesSir Charles Grandison is none of your  gewgawwhipjacks  that you know not where to have But I tell you Dame Selby that neither you nor your niece know how with your  fine  souls and  fine  sense to go out of the common  semalitypath  when you get a man into your gin however superior he is to common  infanglements  and low chicanery and  dull  and  cold  forms as Sir Charles properly called them in his address to the little  pug'sface  I  do  love her with all her pretty ape's tricks For what are you all but right or wrong apes of one another And do you think with  all your wisdom  he sees not through you He does and as a wise man must despise you all with your  femalities  and  forsooths    No femality Mr Selby is designedNo  I am impatient Dame Selby light of my eye and dear to my heart and soul as you are I will take my own way in this I have no mind that the two dearest creatures in the world to me should render themselves  despisable  in the eyes of a man they want to think highly of them And here if I put in and say but a wry word as you think itI am to be called to account  My dear did you not begin the subject said my aunt  I am to be closetted and to be  documentized  proceeded heNot another word of your  documentations  Dame Selby I am not in a humour to bear them I will take my own wayAnd that's enough  And then I suppose he stuck his hands in his sides as he does when he is goodhumouredly angry and my aunt at such times gives up till a more convenient opportunity and then she always carries her point And why Because she is always reasonable for which he calls her a  Parthian  woman  I heard her say as he stalked out royally repeating that he would take his own way I say no more Mr SelbyOnly consider  Oy and let Harriet consider and do  you  consider Dame Selby Sir Charles Grandison is not a common man  I did not let my aunt know that I heard this speech of my uncle She only said to me when she saw me I have had a little debate with your uncle We must  do as well as we can with him my dear He means well  Thursday Morning October    AFTER breakfast first one then another dropt away and left only Sir Charles and me together Lucy was the last that went and the moment she was withdrawn while I was thinking to retire to dress he placed himself by me Think me not abrupt my dear Miss Byron said he that I take almost the only opportunity which has offered of entering upon a subject that is next my heart  I found my face glow I was silent  You have given me hope madam All your friends encourage that hope I love I revere your friends What I have now to petition for is A confirmation of the hope I have presumed upon CAN you madam the Female delicacy is more delicate than that of man  can  be unequally as you may think yourself circumstanced with a man who owns that once he could have devoted himself to another Lady CAN you say that the man before you is the man whom you CAN whom you DO prefer to any other  He stopt expecting my answer  After some hesitations I have been accustomed▪ Sir said I by those friends whom you so  deservedly  value to speak nothing but the simplest truth In an article of this moment I should be inexcusable if  I stopt His eyes were fixed upon my face For my life I could not speak yet wished to be able to speak  If  If  what  madam and he snatched my hand bowed his face upon it held it there not looking up to mine I could then speakIf thus urged and by SIR CHARLES GRANDISONI did not speak my heartI answerSirI CANI DO I wanted I thought just then to shrink into myself  He kissed my hand with fervour dropt down on  one knee again kissed itYou have laid me madam under everlasting obligation And will you permit me before I riseloveliest of women will you permit me to beg an early dayI have many affairs on my hands many more in design now I am come as I hope to settle in my native country for the rest of my life My chief glory will be to behave commendably in the  private  life I wish not to be a  public  man and it must be a very particular call for the Service of my King and Country united that shall draw me out into public notice Make me madam soon the happy  husband  I hope to be I prescribe not to you the time But you are above empty forms May I presume to hope it will be before the end of a month to come  He had forgot himself He said he would not prescribe to me  After some involuntary hesitationsI am afraid of nothing so much just now Sir said I as appearing to a man of your honour and penetration affected Rise Sir I beseech you I cannot bear  I will madam and rise as well as kneel to thank you when you have answered a question so very important to my happiness  Before I could resume Only believe me madam said he that my urgency is not the insolent urgency of one who imagines a Lady will receive as a  compliment  his impatience And if you have no scruple that you think of  high  importance add I beseech you to the obligation you have laid him under to your condescending goodness and add with that frankness of heart which has distinguished you in my eyes above all women the very high one of an early day  I looked downI could not look upI was afraid of being thought affectedYet how could I so soon think of obliging him  He proceededYou are silent madamPropitious be your silence Allow me to enquire of your  aunt  for your kind your condescending acquiescence I will not now urge you further I will be all hope  Let me say Sir that I must not be precipitated These are very early days  Much more was in my mind to say but I hesitatedI could not speak Surely my dear Ladies it was tootoo eary an urgency And can a woman be wholly unobservant of custom and the laws of her SexSomething is due to fashion in dress however absurd that dress might have appeared in the last age as theirs do to us or may in the next And shall not those customs which have their foundation in modesty and are characteristic of the gentler Sex be intitled to excuse and more than excuse  He saw my confusion Let me not my dearest life distress you said he Beautiful as your emotion is I cannot enjoy it if it give you pain Yet is the question so important to me so much is my heart concerned in the favourable answer I hope for from your goodness that I must not let this opportunity slip except it be your pleasure that I attend your determination from Mrs Selby's mouthYet  that  I choose not neither because I presume for more favour from your own than you will on  cold  deliberation allow your aunt to shew me Love will plead for its faithful votary in a single breast when consultation on the supposed fit and unfit the object absent will produce delay But I will retire for two moments You shall be my prisoner mean time Not a soul shall come in to interrupt us unless it be at your call I will return and receive your determination and if that be the fixing of my happy day how will you rejoice me  While I was debating within myself whether I should be angry or pleased he returned and found me walking about the roomSoul of my hope said he taking with reverence my hand I now presume that you  can  that you  will  oblige me  You have given me no time Sir But let me request that you will not expect an answer in relation to the early day you  so  early ask for till after the receipt of your next Letters from Italy You see how the admirable Lady is urged how reluctantly she has given them but  distant  hopes of complying with their wishes I should be glad to wait for the next Letters for those at least which will be an answer to yours acquainting them that there is a woman with whom you think you could be happy I am earnest in this request Sir Think it not owing to affectation  I acquiesce madam The answer to those Letters will soon be here It will indeed be some time before I can receive a reply to that I wrote in answer to Jeronymo's last Letter I impute not affectation to my dearest Miss Byron I can easily comprehend your motive It is a generous one But it besits me to say that the next Letters from Italy whatever may be their contents can  now  make no alteration on my part Have I not declared myself to your friends to you and to the world  Indeed Sir they may make an alteration on mine highly as I think of the honour Sir Charles Grandison does me by his good opinion For pardon me should the most excellent of women think of resuming a place in your heart  Let me interrupt you madamIt cannot  be  that Lady Clementina proceeding as she has done on motives of piety zealous in her religion and all her relations now earnest in another man's favour can alter her mind I should not have acted with justice with gratitude to her had I not tried her stedfastness by every way I could devise Nor in justice to  both  Ladies would I allow myself to apply for  your  favour till I had  her  resolution confirmed to me under her own hand after my arrival in England But were it  now  possible that she should vary and were you madam  to hold your determination in my favour suspended the consequence would be this I should never while that suspence lasted be the husband of  any woman on earth  I hope Sir you will not be displeased I did not think you would so  soon  be so  very  earnest But this Sir I say Let me have reason to think that my happiness will not be the misfortune of a more excellent woman and it shall be my endeavour to make the man happy who  only  can make me so  He clasped me in his arms with an ardorthat displeased me noton reflexionBut at the time startled me He then thanked me again on one knee I held out the hand he held not in his with intent to raise him for I could not speak He received it as a token of favour kissed it with ardor arose  again  pressed my cheek with his lips I was too much surprised to repulse him with anger But was he not too free Am I a prude my dear In the odious sense of the abused word I am sure I am not But in the best sense as derived from  prudence  and used in opposition to a word that denotes a worse character I own myself one of those who would wish to restore it to its natural respectable signification for the sake of virtue which as Sir Charles himself once hinted  Vol IV p  is in danger of suffering by the abuse of it as Religion once did by that of the word  Puritan  Sir Charles on my making towards the door that led to the stairs withdrew with such a grace as shewed he was capable of recollection  Again I ask was he not too free I will tell you how I judge that he was When I came to conclude my narrative to my aunt and Lucy of all that passed between him and me I blushed and could not tell them how free he was Yet you see Ladies that I can write it to you two  Sir Charles my uncle and Mr Deane took a  little walk and returned just as dinner was ready My uncle took me aside and whispered to me I am glad at my heart and soul the ice is broken This is the man of true spirit  Adsheart  Harriet you will be Lady Grandison in a fortnight at furthest I hope You have had a charming  confabulation  I doubt not I can guess you have by Sir Charles's declaring himself more and more delighted with you And he owns that he put the question to youHay HarrietSmiling in my face  Every one's eyes were upon me Sir Charles I believe saw me look as if I were apprehensive of my uncle's raillery He came up to us My dear Miss Byron said he in my uncle's hearing I have owned to Mr Selby the request I presumed to make you I am afraid that he as well as you think me too bold and forward If  you  do madam I ask your pardon My hopes shall always be controuled by your pleasure  This made my uncle complaisant to me I was reassured I was pleased to be so seasonably relieved  Friday Morning October    YOU must not my dear Ladies expect me to be so  very  minute if I am must I not lose a hundred charming conversations One however I will give you a little particularly  Your brother desired leave to attend me in my dressingroomBut how can I attempt to describe his air his manner or repeat the thousand agreeable things he said Insensibly he fell into talking of future schemes in a way that punctillo itself could not be displeased with  He had been telling me that our dear Mr Deane having been affected by his last indisposition had desired my uncle my aunt and him to permit him to lay before them the state of this affairs and the kind things he intended to do by his own relations who  however were all in happy circumstances After which he insisted upon Sir Charles's being his sole executor which he scrupled unless some other person were joined with him in the trust But Mr Deane being very earnest on this head Sir Charles said I hope I know my own heart My dear Mr Deane you must do as you please  After some other discourse I suppose said I the good man will not part with us till the beginning of next week  Whenever you leave him answered he it will be to his regret it may therefore as well be soon But I am sorry methinks that he who has qualities which endear him to every one should be so much alone as he is here I have a great desire when I can be so happy as to find myself a settled man to draw into my neighbourhood friends who will dignify it Mr Deane will I hope be often our visiter at the Hall The love he bears to his dear goddaughter will be his inducement and the air and soil being more dry and wholsome than this so near the fens may be a means to prolong his valuable life  Dr Bartlett continued he has already carried into execution some schemes which relate to my indigent neighbours and the lower class of my tenants How does that excellent man revere Miss ByronMy Beauchamp with our two sisters and their Lords will be often with us Your worthy cousin Reeves's Lord W and his deserving Lady will also be our visiters and we theirs in turn The Mansfield family are already within a few miles of me And our Northamptonshire friendsVisiters and visitedWhat happiness do I propose to myself and the beloved of my heartAnd if as you have generously wished the dear Clementina may be happy at least not unhappy and her brother Jeronymo recover what in this world can be wanting to crown our felicity  Tears of joy strayed down my cheek unperceived  by me till they fell upon his hand as it had mine in it He kissed them away I was abashed If my dear Miss Byron permit me to go on I have her advice to askI bowed my assent My heart throbbed with painful joy I could not speak  Will  it not be too early  madam to ask you about some matters of domestic concern The lease of the house in St James's Square is expired Some difficulties are made to renew it unless on terms which I think unreasonable I do not easily submit to imposition Is there anything that you particularly like in the situation of that house  Houses Sir nay Countries will be alike to me in the company of those I value  You are all goodness madam I will leave it to my sisters to enquire after another house I hope you will allow them to consult you as any one may offer I will write to the owner of my present house who is solicitous to know my determination and says he has a tenant ready if I relinquish it that it will be at his command in three months time When my dear Miss Byron shall bless me with her hand and our Northamptonshire friends will part with her if she pleases we will go directly to the Hall  I bowed and intended to look as one who thought herself obliged  Restrain check me madam whenever I seem to trespass on your goodness Yet how shall I forbear to wish you to hasten the day that shall make you wholly mineYou will the rather allow me to wish it as you will then be more than ever your own mistress tho' you have always been generously left to a discretion that never was more deservedly trusted to Your will madam will ever comprehend mine  You leave me Sir only room to say that if gratiude can make me a merit with you  that  began with the first knowlege I had of you and it has been increasing ever sinceI hope I never shall be ungratefull  Tears again strayed down my check Why did I weep  Delicate sensibility said he He clasped his arms about meBut instantly withdrew them as if recollecting himselfPardon me madam Admiration will sometimes mingle with reverence I must express my gratitude as a manMay my happy day be not far distant that I may have no bound to my joyHe took my hand and again pressed it with his lips My heart madam said he is in your hand You cannot but treat it graciously  Just then came in my Nancy Why came she in with the general expectation of us to breakfastBreakfastWhat thought I is breakfastThe  world  my CharlotteBut hushWithdraw fond heart from my pen Can the  dearest  friend allow for the acknowlegement of impulses so fervent and which writing to the moment as I may say the moment only can justify revealing  He led me downstairs and to my very seat with an air  so  noble yet  so  tenderMy aunt my Lucy everybodylooked at me My eyes betrayed my hardlyconquered emotion  Sir Charles's looks and behaviour were so respectful that every one addressed me as a person of increased consequence Do you think Lady G that Lord G's and Lord L's respectful behaviour to their wives do not as much credit to their own hearts as to their Ladies How happy are you that you have recollected yourself and now encourage not others by your example to make a jest of a  husband  's LoveWill you forgive me the recollection for the sake of the joy I have in the reformation  I HAVE read this Letter just now to my aunt and Lucy all except this last saucy hint to you They clasped me each in their arms and said They admired  him  and were pleased with  me  Instruct me my dear Ladies how to behave in such a manner as  may shew my gratitude I had almost said my Love yet not go so very far as to leave the day the hour everything to his determination  But on reading to my aunt and Lucy what I had written I was ashamed to find that when he was enumerating the friends he hoped to have near him or about him I had forgot to remind him of my Emily Ungrateful HarrietBut don't tell her that I was so absorbed in Self and that the conversation was so interesting that my heart was more of a passive than an active machine at the time I will soon  find  or  make  an occasion to be her solicitress You once thought that Emily for her  own  sake should not live with us but her heart is set upon it Dear creature I love her I will sooth her I will take her to my bosomI will by my sisterly compassion intitle myself to all her confidence She shall have all mine Nor shall her guardian suspect herI will be as faithful to her secret as you and Lady L were thankfully I remember it to mine Don't you think my dear that if Lady Clementina I how to her merit whenever I name her to myself had had such a true such a soothing friend to whom she could have revealed the secret that oppressed her noble heart while her passion was young it would have been attended with such a deprivation of her reason as made unhappy all who had the honour of being related to her  O MY dear Lady G I am undone Emily is undone We are all undoneI am afraid soMy intolerable carelessnessI will run away from him I cannot look him in the faceBut I am most most of all concerned for my Emily  Walking in the garden with Lucy I dropt the last sheet marked this Letter  Beginning Why did I weep p  I missed it not till my aunt this minute told me that Sir Charles crossing the walk which I had just  before quitted stooped and took up a paper Immediately my heart misgave me I took out my Letter I thought I had it allBut the fatal fatal sixth sheet is wanting That must be what he stooped for and took up What shall I doSweet Emily now will he never suffer you to live with him All my own heart laid open tooSuch prattling alsoI  cannot  look him in the faceHow shall I do to get away to Shirleymanor and hide myself in the indulgent bosom of my grandmammaWhat affectation after this will it be to refuse him his dayBut he demands audience of me Could anything O the dear Emily have happened more mortifying to  Your  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XXVI  Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Friday afternoon October    I WAS all confusion when he looking as unconscious as he used to do entred my dressingroom I turned my face from him He seemed surprised at my concern Miss Byron I hope is well Has anything disturbed you madam  My paper my paper You took it upFor the world I would notThe poor EmilyGive it me Give it me and I burst into tears  Was there ever such a fool What business had I to name Emily  He took it out of his pocket I came to give it to you putting it into my hand I saw it was your writing madam I folded it up immediately It has not been unfolded since Not a single sentence did I permit myself to read  Are you sure Sir you have not read it nor any  Part of it  Upon my honour I have not  I cleared up at once A blessed reward thought I for denying my own curiosity when pressed by my Charlotte to read a Letter clandestinely obtained  A thousand thousand thanks to you Sir for not giving way to your curiosity I should have been miserable perhaps for months had you read that paper  You now indeed raise my curiosity madam Perhaps your generosity will permit you to gratify it tho' I should not have forgiven myself had I taken advantage of such an accident  I will tell you the contents of some parts of it Sir  Those which relate to my Emily if you please madam The  poor  Emily you saidYou have  amed me Perhaps I am not to be  quite  happyWhat of  poor  Emily Has the girl been imprudentHas she alreadyWhat of the  poor  Emily  And his face glowed with impatience  No harm Sir of EmilyOnly a request of the dear girl What letter use could I have made of my fright Lady G But the  manner  of my mentioning it I would not for the world you should have seen  No harm you sayI was afraid by your concern for herBut can  you  love her as well as ever If you can Emily must still be good  I can I do  What then dear madam of  poor  Emily Why  poor  Emily  I will tell you The dear girl makes it her request that I will procure of you one favour for her Her heart is set upon it  If Emily continue good she shall only signify her wish and I will comply If  I  am not a Father to her is she not fatherless  Allow me Sir to call you kind good humane  What I want of those qualities Miss Byron will  teach me by her exampleBut what would my Emily  She would live with her guardian Sir  With  me  madamAnd with  you  madamTell me own to me madam  And  with you  That is her wish  And does my beloved Miss Byron think it a  right  wish to be granted Will  she  be the instructing friend the examplary sister now in that time of the dear girl's life when the eye rather than the judgment is usually the director of a young woman's affections  I love the sweet Innocent I could wish her to be always with me  Obliging goodness Then is one of my cares over A young woman from Fourteen to Twenty is often a troublesome charge upon a Friendly heart I could not have asked this favour of you You rejoice me by mentioning it Shall I write a Letter in your name to Emily  There Sir is pen ink and paper  In  your  name madam  I bowed assent mistrusting nothing  He wrote and doubling down shewed me only these words  'My dear Miss Jervois I have obtained for you the desired favourWill you not continue to be as good as you have hitherto beenThat is all which is required of my Emily by her ever affectionate'    I instantly wrote  'Harriet Byron'  But Sir what have you doubled down  Charming confidenceWhat must he be who could attempt to abuse itRead madam what you have signed  I did How my heart throbbedAnd  could  Sir Charles Grandison said I thus  intend  to deceive  Could  Sir Charles Grandison be such a plotter Thank God you are not a bad man  After the words  I have obtained for you the desired favour  followed these  'You must be very good You must resolve to give me nothing but joy joy equal to the love I have for you and to the sacrifice I have made to oblige you Go down my love as soon as you can to Grandisonhall I shall then have one of the sisters of my heart there to receive me If you are there in less than a fortnight I will endeavour to be with you in a fortnight after I sacrifice at least another fortnight's punctilio to oblige you And will you not continue to be as good as you have  hitherto  been That is all which is required of my Emily by c'  Give me the paper Sir holding out my hand for it  Have I forfeited my character with you madamholding it back with an air of respectful gaiety  I must consider Sir before I give you an answer  If I have why should I not send it away and as Miss Byron cannot deny her handwriting hope to receive the benefit of the supposed deceit Especially as it will answer so many good ends For instance your own wishes in Emily's favour as it will increase your own power of obliging and be a means of accelerating the happiness of a man whose principal joy will be in making you happy  Was  it not a pretty piece of deceit Lady G Shall I own that my heart was more inclined to reward than punish him for it And really for a moment I thought of the impracticableness of complying with the request as if I was seriously pondering upon it and was sorry it was not practicable To get away from my dear Mr Deane thought I who will not be in haste to part with us some female bustlings to be got over on our return to Selbyhouse proposal renewed and a little paraded with Why Lady G did you tell me that our Sex is a foolish Sex the preparation the ceremony the awful ceremony the parting with the dearest and most indulgent  friends that ever young creaure was blessed with and to be at Grandisonhall  all  within one monthWas there ever so precipitating a man  I believe verily that I appeared to him as if I were considering of it for he took advantage of my silence and urged me to permit him to send away to Emily what he had written and offered to give reasons for his urgency Written as it is said he by me and signed by you how will the dear girl rejoice at the consent of both under our hands And will she not take the caution given her in it from me as kindly as she will your mediation in her favour  Sure Sir said I you expect not a serious answerUpon his honour he didHow Sir Ought you not rather to be thankful if I forgive you for letting me see that Sir Charles Grandison was capable of such an artifice tho' but in jest and for his reflection upon me and perhaps meant on our Sex as if decorum were but  punctilio  I beg my Lucy's pardon added I for being halfangry with her when she called you a  designer  My dearest creature said he I  am  a designer Who to accelerate a happiness on which that of his whole life depends would not be innocently so I am in this instance selfish But I glory in my selfishness because I am determined if power be lent me that every one within the circle of our acquaintance shall have reason to congratulate you as one of the happiest of women  Till this artifice Sir shewed me what you  could  do were you not a man of the strictest honour I had nothing but affiance in you Give me the paper Sir and for your own sake I will destroy it that it may not furnish me with an argument that there is not  one  man in the world who is to be implicitly confided in by a woman  Take it madam presenting it to me with his usual gracefulness destroy it not however till you have  exposed me as  such  a breach of confidence  deserves  to your aunt your LucyTo your uncle Selby and Mr  Deane  if you please  Ah Sir you know your advantages I will not in this case refer to them I could sooner rely dearly as they love their Harriet on Sir Charles Grandison's justice than on their favour in  any  debate that should happen between him and me  There never madam except in the case before us can be room for a reference Your prudence and my gratitude must secure us both Even now impatient as I am to call you mine which makes me willing to lay hold of every opportunity to urge you for an early day I will endeavour to subdue that impatience and submit to your will Yet let me say that if I did not think your heart one of the most laudably unreserved yet truly delicate that woman ever boasted and your prudence equal you would not have found me so acquiescent a Lover early as you  suppose  my urgency for the happy day  And is it  not  early Sir Can Sir Charles Grandison think me punctiliousBut you will permit me to write to Miss Jervois  myself  and acquaint her with her granted wish if  If No  if  madamWhatever you think right to be done in this case that do Emily will be more particularly your ward than mine if you condescend to take the trust upon you  You will be pleased dear Lady G to acquaint Emily with the grant of her wish She will rejoice God give the dear creature reason for joy and then I shall have double pleasure in having contributed to her obtaining of it But on second thoughts I will write to her myself for I allow not that she shall see or hear read everything I write to you Shall I own to you that my grandmamma and aunt and Lucy are of your mind They all three wishBut who can deny the dear Innocent the grant of a request on which she  has so long set her heart And would it not be pity methinks I hear the world say some time hence especially if any mishap God forbid it should befal her that Sir Charles Grandison the most honourable of men should so marry as that a young Lady of innocence and merit and mistress of a fortune which it might be foreseen would encourage the attempts of designing men could not have lived with his wifePoor childThen would the  world  have shaken its wise head allow the expression and well for me if it had judged so mildly of me  Our dear Mr Deane tho' reluctantly has consented that we shall leave him on Monday next We shall set out directly for Selbyhouse where we propose to be the same night My aunt and I have been urgent with him to go back with us but he is cross and  will  be excused  Just now Lucy tells me that Mr Deane declared to my uncle aunt and her that he will not visit us at Selbyhouse till we send for him and the settlements together which he will have ready in a weekStrange expedition Sure they are afraid your brother will change his mind and are willing to put it out of the poor man's power to recede Lucy smiles at me and is sure she says that she may in confidence reveal all these matters to me without endangering my  life  My next Letter will be from Selbyhouse  While that life continues my dear Ladies look upon me as assuredly  Yours  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XXVII  Lady  G  To Miss  BYRON  Monday Oct    GO on go on with your narratives my dear Hitherto Caroline and I know not how either  much to blame you or totally to acquit you of  parade  the man and his situation considered and the state of your heart for so many months past every one of your friendsconsenting shall I say  more  than consenting  ardent  to be related to him Hark ye Harriet let me whisper youMy brother whether he come honestly or not by his knowlege I dare say thinks not so highly of the Freemasonry part of marriage as you doYou start O Charlotte you cryAnd O Harriet tooBut my dear girl let my brother see that you think and no woman in the world does if you don't that the true modesty after hearts are united is to think little of parade and much of the social happiness that awaits two worthy minds united by Love and conformity of sentimentAfter all we are silly creatures Harriet We are afraid of wise men No wonder that we seldom choose them when a fool offers I wish I knew the man however who dare to say this in my hearing  Your grandmother Shirley is more than woman My brother prodigiously admires her I think you may trust to her judgment if you suppose him too precipitating Your aunt is an excellent woman But I never knew a woman or man who valued themselves on delicacy and found themselves consulted upon it but was apt to overdo the matter Is not this a little a  very  little Mrs Selby's case Let her know that I bid you ask this question of herself She must be assured that I equally love and honour her so won't be angry  Your uncle is an odd but a very honest Dunstable soul Tell him I say so but withal that he should leave women to act as  women  in these matters  What a duce what a pize  would he expect perfection from them He whose arguments always run in the depreciating strain If he  would  ask him  Where  should they have it conversing as they are obliged to do with men Men for their fathers for their brothers  for their unclesThey  must  be a  little  silly had they not a  fund  of silliness in themselvesBut I would not have them be most  out  in matters where they should be most  in  I think however so does Lady L that so far as you have proceeded you are tolerable tho' not half so clever as he considering situations Upon my word Harriet allowing for everything neither of Sir Charles Grandison's sisters expected that their brother would have made so ardent so polite a Lover He is so  prudent  a man and that once had like to have been one of  your  even  your  objectionsYet so nobly sincereso manly O that my apeBut come Harriet as men go in this age of monkeys and Sir Foplings Lord G for all  you  is not to be despised I as a good wise ought will take his part whoever runs him down Where much is not given much andsoforth  I have told Emily the good news I could not help it tho' you promise to write to her  Poor thing she is all ecstasy she is not the only one who seeks as her greatest good what may possibly prove her greatest misfortune But for her sake for your sake and my brother's I hope under your directing eye and by prudent management the flame so young a  little  cold water will do and that if it  will  blaze it may be directed towards Beauchamp's house  Let me whisper you again HarrietYoung girls finding themselves vested with new powers and a set of new inclinations turn their staring eyes out of themselves and the first man they see they imagine if he be a single man and but simpers at them they must receive him as a Lover Then they return downcast for ogle that he may ogle on without interruption They are soon brought to write answers to Letters which confess flames the writer's heart never felt The girl doubts not her own gifts her own  consequence she wonders that her father mother and other friends never told her of these newfound excellencies She is more and more beautiful in her own eyes as he more and more flatters her If her parents are  a  verse the girl is  per  verse and the more the less discretion there is in her passion She adopts the word  constancy  she declaims against  persecution  she calls her idle flame LOVE which only was a Something she knew not what to make ofand like a wandering bee had it not settled on this flower would on the next were it either bitter or sweet  And this generally with the thoughtless is the beginning and progress of that formidable invader miscalled  Love  a word very happily at hand to help giddy creatures to talk with and look without confusion of face on a man telling them a thousand lyes and hoping perhaps by illaudable means to attain an end not in  itself  illaudable when duty and discretion are the one the guide the other the gentle restraint  But as to EmilyI depend on her  principles  as well as on your affectionate discretion when you will be pleased among ye to permit my brother  to be actually yours  for restraining her imagination There never beat in Female bosom an honester heart Poor thing she is  but  a girl And who is the woman or child that looks on my brother without love and reverence  For Emily's sake you see you must not have too many of your honest uncle's  circumroundabouts  He makes us laugh I love to have him angry with his Dame Selby Dear Harriet when your heart's quite at case give us the courtship of the odd soul to  the light of his eyes his  oddness and  her  delicay A charming contrast You  did  help us to a little of it once  See p seq  you know Theirs on the woman's side could not be a match of Love at first But who so happy as they I am convinced Harriet that Love  on one side and discretion on the other is enough in conscience and in short much better than Love on both For what room can there be for discretion in the latter case The man is guilty of an heterodoxy in Love you know who is  prudent  or but suspected of being soAh Harriet Harriet once more I say we women are foolish creatures in our Loveaffairs and know not what's best for ourselvesIn your stile  'Don't you think so Lucy'  Yet I admire LucyShe got over an improperlyplaced Love and now her mad fit over We have  all  little or much of it  begun  as I told you how she is  so  cool  so  quiet  so  sedateYet once I make no doubt looking forward to her present happy quiescence would have thought it a state of insipidity Dearly do we love racketing and another whisper some of us to be racketedBut not  you  you are an exception Yes to be sureBut I believe you'll think me mad  We like my brother's little trick upon you in the Billet he wrote and which you signed as if to Emily You see how earnest he is my dear I long for his next Letters from Italy I think that is a lucky plea enough for you if you suppose parade necessary  We have got Everard among us again The sorry fellowO Harriet had you seen him with his hat upon his two thumbs bowing cringing blushing confounded when first he came into my royal presenceBut I from my throne extended the golden sceptre to him as I knew I should please my brother by it He sat down when I bid him twisted his lips curdled his chin hemm'd stole a look of reverence at me looked down when his eyes met mine  mine  bold as innocence  his  conscious as guilt hemm'd again turned his hat about then with one of his not quiteforgotten airs of pertness putting it under his arm shook his ears tried to look up then his eye sunk again under my broader eyeO my dearWhat a paltry creature is a man vicebitten and sensible of detected folly and obligation  Sir Charles has made a man of him once more His dress is as gay as ever and I dare say he struts as much in it as ever in company that knows not how he came by it  He  reformedBad habits are of the Jerusalem artichokekind once planted there is no getting them out of the ground  Our good Dr Bartlett is also with us at present He is in hopes of seeing my brother in town  'In town'  Harrietand the great affair unsolemnizedWoe be to you ifBut let's see how you act when left to yourself Prudent people in other's matters are not always prudent in their own especially in their Loveaffairs A little overnicety at setting out will carry them into a road they never intended to amble in and then they are sometimes obliged to the  less  prudent to put them in the path they set out from Remember my dear  I  am at hand if you bewilder yourself  Dr Bartlett tells us that my brother has extricated this poor creature from his entanglements with his woman by his interposition only by Letter Some money I suppose The Doctor desires to be silent on the means but hints however that Everard will soon be in circumstances not unhappy  I HAVE got the Doctor to explain himself Every day produces some new instances of womens follies What would poor battered rakes and younger brothers do when on their last legs were it not for goodnatured widowsAy and sometimes for forward maids This wretch it seems has acquitted himself so handsomely in the discharge of the  l  which he owed to his winemerchant's relict and the Lady was so full of acknowlegements and obligations and all that for being paid but her due that he has ventured to make addresses to her Love as it is called and is well received He behaves with more spirit before her I suppose than he does before me  The widow had a plain diligent honest man before She has what is called  taste  forsooth or believes she has She thinks Mr Grandison a finer gentleman than him who left her in a condition to be thougbt worthy of the address of a gayer man She prides herself it seems in the relation that her marriage will give her to a man of Sir Charles Grandison's character Much  worse  reasons will have weight when a woman finds herself inclined to change her condition But Everard is very earnest that my brother should know nothing of the matter till all is over So you as I have this piece of news in confidence Lady L has not been told it His cousin he says who refused him his interest with Miss Mansfield Lady W's sister because he thought a further time of probation with regard to his avowed good resolutions necessary would perhaps for the widow's sake if applied to  put a spoke in his wheel  Everard I can hardly allow myself to call him Grandison avows a vehement passion for the widow She is  rich  When they are set out together in  taste  as she calls it trade or business her first rise quite forgot what a gay what a frolick dance will she and her new husband in a little while lead up on the grave of her poor plain despised one  'Tis well 'tis well my dear Harriet that I have a multitude of faults myself Witness to go no further back this Letter or I should despise nine parts of the world out of ten  I find that Sir Charles and Beauchamp and Dr Bartlett correspond Light is hardly more active than my brother nor lightning more quick when he has anything to execute that must or ought to be done I believe I told you early that was a part of his character You must not then wonder or be offended Shall I use the word  offended  my dear that you in your turn now he has found himself at liberty to address you should be affected by his adroitness  and vivacity in your  Femalities  as uncle Selby calls them Aptly enough I think tho' I do not love that men should be so impudent as either to find us out or abuse us You cannot always were you to  think  him too precipitating separate bad qualities from good in the same person since perhaps the one is the constitutional occasion of the other Could he for example be half so useful a friend as he is if he were to dream over a Loveaffair as you would seem to have him in other words gape over his ripened fruit till it dropt into his yawyawyawning mouth He'll certainly get you Harriet within or near his proposed time Look about you He'll have you before you know where you are By  book  as the saying is will he pull you to him struggle as you will he has already got hold of you  or by crook  inviting nay compelling you by his generosity gentle shepherdlike to nymph as gentle What you do therefore do with such a grace as may preserve to you the appearance of having it in your power to lay an obligation upon him It is the opinion of both his sisters that he values you more for your noble expansion of heart and not ignorant but generous frankness of manners yet mingled with dignity than forevenyour Beauty HarrietWhether you who are in such full possession of every grace of person care as a woman to hear of that or not His gay parterre similitude you remember my dear It is my firm belief that those are the greatest admirers of fine flowers who love to see them in their borders and seldomest pluck the fading fragrance The other wretches crop put them in their bosoms and in an hour or two rose carnation or whatever after one parting smell throw them away  He is very busy whereever he is At his inn I suppose most But he boasts not to you or anybody of what he does  He writes nowandthen a Letter to aunt Nell and  she is  so  proud of the favourLook you here niece Look you hereBut I sha'n't shew you  all  he writesOn go the spectaclesfor she will not for the world part with the Letter out of her handsShe reads one paragraph one sentence then anotherOn and off go the spectacles while she conjectures explains animadverts applauds and so goes on till she leaves not a line unread Then folding it up carefully in its cover puts it in her Letter or Ribbandcase which shall I call it For having but few Letters to put in it the case is filled with bits and ends of ribbands patterns andsoforth of all manner of colours faded and fresh with intermingledoms of goldbeaters skin plaisters for a cut finger for a chopt lip a kibe perhaps for corns which she dispenses occasionally very bountifully and values herself as we see at such times by a double chin made triple for being not unuseful in her generation Chide me if you will the humour's upon me hang me if I care You are only Harriet Byron as yet Change your name and increase your consequence  I have written a long Letter already and to what end Only to expose myself say you True enough But now Harriet to bribe you into passing a milder censure let me tell you all I can pick up from the Doctor relating to my brother's matters Bribe shall I call this or gratitude for your free communications  Matters between the Mansfields and the Keelings are brought very forward Hang particulars Nobody's affairs lie near my heart but yours The two families have already begun to visit When my brother returns all the gentry in the neighbourhood are to be invited to rejoice with the parties on the occasion  Be so kind my dear as to dismiss the good man as soon as your punctilio will admit We are contented that while he lays himself out so much in the  service of others he should do something for himself You my dear we look upon as a high reward for his many great and good actions But as he is a man who has a deep sense of favours granted and values not the blessing the more when it  ought  to be within his reach because it is dear as is the case of the sorry fellows in general I would have you consider of itthat's all  The Doctor tells me also that the wicked Bolton's ward is dead and that everything is included to Sir Charles's satisfaction with him and the Mansfields reinstated in all their rights are once more a happy family  Sir Hargrave is in a lamentable way Dr Bartlett has great compassion for him Would you have  me  pity him HarrietYou would you sayWell then I'll try for it As it was by his means you and we and my brother came acquainted I think I  may  He is to be brought to town  Poor Sir Harry Beauchamp He is past recovery Had the physicians given him over when they first undertook him he might they say have had a chance for it  I told you that Emily's mother was turned Methodist She has converted her husband A strange alteration But it is natural for such sort of people to pass from one extreme to another Emily every nowandthen visits them They are ready to worship her for her duty and goodness She is a lovely girl She every day improves in her person as well as in her mind She is sometimes with me sometimes with Lady L sometimes with aunt Eleanor sometimes with your Mrs ReevesWe are ready to fight for her But you will soon rob all of us She is preparing for her journey to you Poor girl I pity her  Such  a conflict in her mind between her love of you and tenderness for her guardian Her Anne has confessed to me that she weeps one half of the night  yet forces herself to be lively in companyAfter the example of Miss Byron she says when she visited you at Selby house I hope my dear all will be right But to go to live with a beloved objectI don't understand it You Harriet may I never was in Love God help me  I am afraid the dear girl does too much for her mother As they have so handsome an annuity  l  a year so much beyond their expectation I think she should not give nor should they receive anything considerable of her without her guardian's knowlege She is laying out a great deal of money in new cloaths to do you and her guardian crediton your nuptials poor thing she says with tears in her eyesbut whether of joy or sensibility it is hard to decide but I believe of both  What makes me imagine she does more than she should is that a week ago she borrowed fifty guineas of me and but yesterday came to meI should do a very wrong thing said she blushing up to the ears should I ask Lady L to lend me a sum of money till my next quarter comes due after I made myself your debtor so lately But if you  could  lend me thirty or forty guineas more you would do me a great favour  My dear said I and stared at her  Don't question don't chide me this one time I never will run in debt again I hate to be in debt But you have bid me tell you all my wants  I will not my love say another word I will fetch you fifty guineas more  More  my dear Lady G that is a pretty rub But I will always for the future be within bounds And don't let my guardian know itHe would kill me by his generosity yet perhaps in his own heart wonder what I did with my money If  he  thought ill of me or that I was extravagant it would break my heart  Only my dear said I remember that  l  a  yearMrs OHara cannot want anything to be done for her now  Don't call her Mrs OHara She is very good Call her my mother  I kissed the sweet girl and fetched her the other fifty guineas  I thought it not amiss to give you this hint my dear against she goes down to you But do you think it right after all to have her with my brother and you  Lady L keeps closeShe fasts cries prays is vastly apprehensive She makes me uneasy for her and myself These vile men I believe I shall hate them all Did  they  partakeBut not half so grateful as the blackbirds They rather look big with insolence than perch near and sing a song to confort the poor souls they have so dreadfully mortified Other birds as I have observed sparrows in particular sit hour and hour he's and she's in turn and I have seen the hen when her rogue has staid too long rattle at him while he circles about her with sweeping wings and displayed plumage his head and breast of various dyes ardently shining peep peep peep as much as to say I beg your pardon loveI was forced to go a great way off for my dinnerSirrah I have thought she has said in an unforgiving accentDo your duty nowSit closePeep peep peepI will I will I willAway has she skimmed and returned to relieve himwhen she thought fit  Don't Laugh at us Harriet in our mortified state Begone wretch  What have I done madam  stareing What have you doneMy sorry fellow came in wheedling courting just as I was pitying two meek sisters Was it not enough to vex one Don't laugh at us I say  If you do  May my brother all in good time avenge us on  you  prays in malice  CHARLOTTE G  LETTER XXVIII  Miss  BYRON  To Lady  G  Wedn Evening Oct    FIE upon you Lady G What a Letter have you written There is no separating the good from the bad in it With what dangerous talents are you entrusted and what use do you make of them I have written two long Letters continuing my narrative of our proceedings but I must take you to severe task for this before me and  this  and  they  shall go together  Wicked wit What a foe art thou to decent chearfulnessIn a  woman  's hand such a weapon What might we not expect from it were it in a man's How you justify the very creatures of that Sex whom you would be thought to despise  But you say you would not allow in a man the liberties you yourself take with your own Sex How can you my dear be so partial to your faults yet own them to be such Would you rank with the worst of sinners They do just so  I may be a fool I may be inconsistent I may not know how with a grace to give effect to my own wishes I may be able to advise better than actMost pragmatical creatures think they can be counsellors in another's case while their own affairs as my uncle would say  lie at sixes and sevens  But how does this excuse your freedoms with your whole SexWith the Innocents of it more particularly  Let me say my dear that you take odious yes  odious  liberties I won't recal the word Liberties which I cannot tho' to shame you repeat Fie upon you Charlotte  And yet you say that neither you nor Lady L know how to blame me much tho' the man considered  you will not totally acquit me of parade and in another place that so far as we have proceeded we have behaved tolerably Why then all this riotyes riot Charlotte against us and against our Sex  What  but for riot's sake  'The humour upon you'  The humour is upon you with a witness  'Hang you if you care'  But my dear it would be more to your credit if you  did  care and if you checked the wicked humourDo you think nobody but you has such talents Fain would I lower you since as it is evident you take pride in your  licence  Forgive me my dearYet I will not say all I think of your wicked wit Think you that there are not many who could be as smart as surprising as you were they to indulge a vein of what you call humour Do you think your brother is not one Would not he be too hard for you at your own weapons Has he not convinced you that he could But he a  man  can check the overflowing freedom  But if I  have  set out wrong with your brother I will do my endeavour to recover my path You greatly oblige me with your conducting hand But what necessity was there for you to lead me through briars and thorns and to plunge me into two or three dirty puddles in order to put me into the right path when it lay before you in a direct line without going a bowshot about  Be pleased however to consider situation on  my  side as well as on your brother's I might be a little excusable for my aukwardness perhaps were it considered that the notion of a  double  or  divided Love  on the man's part came often into my head indeed could not be long out the Lady so superlatively excellent his affection for her so  allowably  as well as  avowedly  strong Was it possible to avoid little jealousies little petulancies when slights were imaginable The more for the excellency of the man  the more for my past weakness of  so many months  I pretend not my dearest Charlotte to be got above nature I know I am a weak silly girl I am humbled in the sense I have of his and Clementina's superior merits True Love will ever make a person think manly of himself in proportion as she thinks highly of the object Pride will be up sometimes but in the pull two ways between that and mortification a torn coat will be the consequence And must not the  tatterdemallion  What a new language will my uncle teach me then look simply  You bid me ask my auntYou bid me tell my uncleNaughty Charlotte I will ask I will tell them nothing Pray write me a Letter next that I can read to  them  I skipt this passageRead that'um'um'umThen skipt againHeyday What's come to the girl cried my uncle Can Lady G write what Harriet cannot read There was a rebuke for you Charlotte For the love of God let me read itHe bustled laughed shook his shoulders rubbed his hands at the imaginationSome pretty roguery I warrant Dearly do I love Lady G If you love me Harriet let  me  read and once he snatched one of the sheets I boldly struggled with him for itFor shame Mr Selby said my aunt My dear said my grandmother if your uncle is so impetuous you must shew him no more of your Letters  He then gave it upConsider Charlotte what a fine piece of work we should have had with my uncle had he read it through  But let me seeWhat are the parts of this wicked Letter for which I can sincerely thank youO my dear I cannot cannot without soiling my fingers pick them outYour intelligences however are among those which I hold for favours  Poor Emily that is a subject which delights yet saddens meWe are  laudably  fond of distinguishing  merit But your brother's is so dazlingEvery woman is one's rival But no more of my Emily Dear creature the subject pains meYet I cannot quit itYou ask If after all I think it right that she should live with meWhat can I say For  her  sake perhaps it will not Yet how is her heart set upon it For my own sake as there is no perfect happiness to be expected in this life I could be content to bear a little pain were that dear girl to be either benefited or pleasured by it Indeed I love her at my heartAnd what is moreI love myself for so sincerely loving her  In the wicked part of your Letter what you write of your aunt EleanorBut I have no  patience  with you sinner as you are against light and better knowlege and derider of the infirmities not of old maids but of old ageDon't you hope to live long yourself That worthy Lady wears not spectacles Charlette because she never was so  happy  as to be married Wicked Charlotte to owe such obligation to the generosity of good Lord G for taking pity of you in time Were you Four or Fiveandtwenty when he honoured you with his hand at St George's church and yet to treat him as you do in more places than one in this very Letter  But I will tell you what I will do with this same strange LetterI will transcribe all the good things in it There are many which both delight and instruct and some morning before I dress for the day I will Sad task Charlotte But it shall be by way of penance for some of my faults and sollies transcribe the intolerable passages so make two Letters of it One I will keep to shew my friends here in order to increase if it be possible their admiration of my Charlotte the bad one I will present to you I know I shall transcribe it in a violent hurryNot much matter whether it be legible or notThe  hobbling  it will cause in the reading will make it appear  worse to you than if you could read it as glibly as you write If half of it  be  illegible enough will be lest to make you blush for the whole and wonder what sort of a pen it was that somebody unknown to you put into your standish  After all spare me not my everdear my evercharming friend spare only your  self  Don't let Charlotte run away from both G's You will then be always equally sure of my admiration and love For dearly do I love you with all your faults so dearly that when I consider your faults by themselves I am ready to arraign my heart and to think there is more of the roguery of my Charlotte in it than I will allow of  One punishment to you I intend my dearIn all my future Letters I will write as if I had never seen this your naughty one Indeed I am in a kind of way faulty or not that I cannot get out of all at once but as soon as I can I will that I may better justify my displeasure at some parts of your Letter by the observance I will pay to others That is a sweet sentence of my Charlotte's  'Change your name and increase your consequence'  Reflect my dearHow naughty must you have been that such a charming instance of goodness could not bribe to spare you  Your everaffectionate and grateful HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XXIX  Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Selbyhouse  Tuesday Morning Oct    MR Deane would not go back with us He laid a strict charge upon me at parting not to be punctilious  I am  not  my dear Lady G Do  you  think I am The men are their own enemies if they wish  us  to  be openhearted and sincere and are not so  themselves  Let them enable us to depend on their candour as much as we may on that of Sir Charles Grandison and the women will be inexcusable who shall play either the prude or coquet with them You will say I am very cunning perhaps to form at the same time a rule  from  and an excuse  for  my own conduct to this excellent man But be that as it will it is truth  We sent our duty last night to Shirleymanor and expect every moment the dear parent there with us  She is come I will go down and if I get her by myself or only with my aunt and Lucy I will tell her a thousand thousand agreeable things which have passed since last I had her tender blessing  WE have had this Greville and this Fenwick here I could very well have spared them Miss Orme came hither also uninvited to breakfast a favour she often does us I knew not at first how to behave to Sir Charles before her She looked so jealous of him so cold Under her bent brow she looked at him Yes and No were all her answers with an air  so  stiffBut this reserve lasted not above a quarter of an hour Sir Charles addressed himself to  me  with so much respect to  her  with so polite a freedom that she could not hold her shyness  Her brow cleared up her eyes looked larger and more free Her buttonedup pretty mouth opened to a smile She answered she asked questions gave her required opinion on more topics than one and was  again  all Miss Orme  Everybody took great notice of Sir Charles's fine address to her and were charmed with him for we all esteem Mr Orme and love his sister How pleasant it was to see the sunshine break out in her amiable countenance and the gloom vanishing by degrees  She took me out into the lesser parlourWhat a strange variable creature am I said she How I hated this Sir Charles Grandison before I saw him I was vexed to find him at first sight answer what I had heard of him for I was resolved to dislike him tho' he had been an angel But ah my poor brotherI am afraid I myself shall be ready to give up his interestNo wonder my dear Miss Byron that nobody else would do when you had seen this manBut still let me bespeak your pity for my brotherWould to Heaven you had not gone to LondonWhat went you thither for  Sir Charles kindly enquired of her after Mr Orme's health praised him for his character wished his recovery and to be allowed to cultivate the friendship of so worthy a man And all this with an air so sincereBut good men must love one another  SIR Charles has just now declared to my aunt that he thinks of going up to town or to Grandisonhall I forget if they told me which tomorrow or next day Perhaps he knows not  to which  himself I was surprised Perhaps he is tired with us Let me recollect  Thursday was Se'nnight  Why indeed he has been down with us twelve daysNo less  But he has no doubts no suspences frum  us  to keep Love awake His path is plain and smooth before him He has demanded his day We think we cannot immediately and after so short a time past since his declaring himself give it himAnd why should he lose his precious time among us I suppose he will be so  good  as to hold himself in readiness to obey  our  summonsHe expects a summons from  us  perhaps  O my dear Lady G am I not perverse I believe I am Yet where there is room from past circumstances to dread a slight tho' none may be intended and truly as I honour and revere Lady Clementina my mind is not always great enough perhaps from consciousness  of demerit to carry itself above apprehension and petulance noble as is the man  My uncle is a little down upon it and why Because truly my grandmamma has told him that it is really too early yet to fix the day and he reverences as every body does her judgment  But why he asks cannot there be preparation making Why may not something be seen  going forward  What  before the day is named my aunt asksAs Harriet had desired to have his next Letters arrive before she directly answered his question she could  not  recede  He went from them both greatly dissatisfied and exclaiming against womens love of power and never knowing how to make a right use of it  A message from Sir Charles He desires to attend me I believe I shall be a little sullen I know my heart It is all his own and I am  loth  to disoblige himBut he was far far more attendant on Lady Clementina's motions Don't you think so Lady G But she was all excellenceWellBut hushI say no more  I WILL give you an account of our conversation I verily believe that had he not touched the poor snail with too hasty a singer which made her shrink in again into her shell I might have been brought to name the week tho' not the day  But I will not anticipate  He entered with a very polite and affectionate air He enquired after my health and said I looked not wellOnly  vexed  thought I  It is impossible I believe to hold displeasure in the presence of a beloved object with whom we are not mortally offended My dearest Miss Byron said he taking my passive hand I am come to ask your advice on twenty subjects In the first place here is a Letter  from Lady G recommending to me a house near her own He gave it to me I read it Should you madam approve of Grosvenor Square  I was silent You will guess how my captious folly appeared to him by what he said to me He respectfully took my handWhy so solemn dear madam Why so silent Has anything disturbed you Some little displeasure seems to hang upon that open countenance Not at me I hope  Yes it  is  thought I But I did not intend you should see itI cleared up and without answering his question said It is in the neighbourhood of Lady L I hope  Thank you madam for that  hope  It is Nor far from your cousin Reeves's  I can have no objection Sir  I will refer myself on this sublect if you please to my sisters and Lord G He values himself on his taste in houses and furniture and will be delighted to be put into commission with my sisters on this occasion Or shall I stay till the happy day is over and leave the choice wholly to yourself  Lady G Sir seems pleased with the house She writes that there is somebody else about it It may not then be to be had  Shall I then commission her to take it directly  What you please Sir  He bowed to me and said Then that matter is settled And now madam let me own all my arts You would penetrate into them if I did not You see that the great question is never out of my viewI cannot but hope and believe that you are above regarding  mere  punctilioHave you my dearest Miss Byron thought can you think of some early weak in which to fix my happy daySome preparation on your part I presume will be thought necessary As to mine were you to bless me with your hand next week I should be aforehand in that particular  I was silent I was considering how to find some middle way that should make noncompliance appear neither disobliging nor affected  He looked up at me with Love and Tenderness in his aspect but having no answer proceeded  Your uncle madam and Mr Deane will inform you that the settlements are such as cannot be disapproved of I expect every day some slight tokens of my affection for my dear Miss Byron which will be adorned by the lovely wearer I have not been so extravagant in them as shall make her think I build on toys for her approbation She will allow me to give her my notions on this subject In the article of personal appearance I think that propriety and degree should be consulted as well as fortune  Our  degree  our  fortune madam is not mean but I who always wished for the revival of Sumptuary Laws have not sought in this article to emulate Princes In my own dress I am generally a conformist to the fashion Singularity is usually the indication of something wrong in judgment I rather perhaps dress too shewy tho' a young man for one who builds nothing on outward appearance But my father loved to be dressed In matters which regard not morals I choose to appear to his friends and tenants as not doing discredit to his magnificent spirit  Miss Byron observes Vol I Let xxxvi p that Sir Charles's dress and equipage are rather gay than plain She l  ttle thought at that time that he had such a reason to give for it as he here suggests  I could not think it becoming as those perhaps do who have the direction of the royal stamp on the coin to set my face the contrary way to that of my predecessor In a word all my father's steps in which I could tread I did and have chosen rather to build upon than demolish his foundationsBut how does my vanity mislead me I  have  vanity madam I have pride and some consequential failings which I cannot always get above But  anxious as I ever shall be for your approbation my whole heart shall be open to you and every motive every spring of action so far as I can trace it be it to my advantage or not shall be made known to you Happy the day that I became acquainted with Dr Bartlett He will tell you madam that I am corrigible You must perfect by your sweet conversation  un  coupled with fear what Dr Bartlett has so happily begun and I shall then be more worthy of you than at present I am  O Sir you do me too much honour You must be  my  monitor As to the ornaments you speak of I hope I shall always look upon simplicity of manners a grateful return to the man I shall vow to honour and a worthy behaviour to all around me as my principal ornaments  His eyes glistened He bowed his face upon my hand to hide as I thought his emotion Excellent Miss Byron said he Then after a pause Now let me say that I have the happiness to find my humble application to you acceptable to every one of your friends The only woman on earth whom besides yourself I ever could have wished to call mine and all her evertobe respected family pleading their  own  sakes join their wishes in my favour and were you to desire it would I am sure signify as much to you under their own hands I know not whether I could so far have overcome my own scruples in behalf of your delicay placing myself as persons always ought when they hope for favour in the granter's place as to supplicate you so  soon  as I have done but at the earnest request of a family and for the sake of a Lady I must ever hold dear The world about you  expects  a speedy celebration I have not I own been backward to  encourage  the expectation It was impossible to conceal from it the motive of my coming down as my abode was at an inn I came with an equipage because my pride How great is my pride permitted  me not to own that I doubted Have you madam a material objection to an early day Be so good to inform me if you have I wish to remove every shadow of doubt from your heart  I was silent He proceeded  Let me not pain you madamlifting my hand to his lipsI would not pain you for the world You have seen the unhappy Olivia You have perhaps heard her story from herself What must be the cause upon which self partiality cannot put a gloss Because I knew not how It was shocking to my nature to repulse a Lady she took my pity for encouragement Pity from a  Lady  of a man is nobleThe declaration of pity from a  man  for a woman may be thought a vanity bordering upon insult Of such a nature is  not  mineShe has some noble qualitiesfrom my heart for her character's sake I pity Olivia and the more for that violence of temper which she never was taught to restrain If madam you have any scruples on  her  account own them I will for I honestly  can  remove them  O Sir None NoneNot the least on that unhappy Lady's account  Let me say proceeded he that Olivia reveres you and wish  s you I hope cordially for she is afraid still of your sisterexcellence to be mine Give me leave to boast It  is  my boast that tho' I have had pain from individuals of your Sex I can look back on my past life and bless God that I never from  childhood  to  manhood  WILFULLY gave pain either to the MOTHERLY or SISTERLY heart  See his mother's written acknowlegement to this purpose Vol II p  nor from  manhood  to the  present hour  to any other woman  O Sir SirWhat is it you call  pain  if at this instant and I said it with tears  that  which your goodness makes me feel is not soThe dear the excellent Clementina What a perverseness is in  her  fate She and she  only  could have deserved you  He bent his knee to the greatlyhonoured HarrietI acknowlege with transport said he the joy you give me by your magnanimity such a more than sisterly magnanimity to that of Clementina How nobly do you authorize my regard for  her  In  you  madam shall I have all  her  excellencies without the abatements which must have been allowed had she been mine from considerations of Religion and Country Believe me madam that my Love of her if I know my heart is of such a nature as never can abate the fervor of that I vow to you To both of you my principal attachment was to MIND Yet let me say that the  personal  union to which you discourage me not to aspire and the  duties  of that most intimate of all connexions will preserve  to you  the  due  preference as allow me to say it would have done to  her  had she accepted of my vows  O Sir believe me incapable of affectation of petulance of disguise My heart Why should I not speak freely to Sir Charles Grandison is wholly yoursIt never knew another Lord I will flatter myself that had you never known Lady Clementina and had she not been a prior Love you never would have had a divided heartWhat pain must you have had in the conflict My regard for you bids me acknowlege my own vanity in my pity for you  I gushed into tearsYou must leave me SirI cannot bear the exaltation you have given me  I turned away my face I thought I should have fainted  He clasped me to his bosom He put his cheek to mine For a moment we neither of us could speak  He broke the short silence I dread the effects on your tender health of the pain I or rather your own greatness of mind give you Beloved of my heart kissing my cheek wet at that moment with the tears of both forgive meAnd be assured that Reverence will  always  accompany my Love Will it be too  much just now to reurge the day that shall answer the wishes of Clementina of her noble brothers of all our own friends and make you wholly mine  His air was so noble his eyes shewed so much awe yet such manly dignity that my heart gave way to its natural impulseWhy Sir should I not declare my reliance on your candour My honour in the world's eye I entrust to you But bid men ot do an improper thing left my desire of obliging you should make me forget myself  Was not this a generous resignation Did it not deserve a generous return But he even Sir Charles Grandison endeavoured to make his advantage of it Letters from Italy unreceived as if he thought my reference to those a punctilio also  What a depositYour honour madam is safely entrusted Can punctilio be honourIt is but the shadow of it What but  that  stands against your grant of an early dayDo not think me misled by my impatience to call you mine to take an undue advantage of your condescension Is it not the happiness of  both  that I wish to confirm And shall I suffer false delicacy false gratitude to take place of the trueAllow me madamBut you seem uneasyI will prolong the time I had intended to beg you would permit me to limit you to Let me request from you the choice of some one happy day before the expiration of the next  fourteen    Consider Sir  Nothing madam happening in my behaviour to cause you to revoke the generous trust From  abroad  there cannot  He looked to be in earnest in his request Was it not  almost  an ungenerous return to my confidence in him Twelve days only had elasped since his personal declaration the Letters from Italy which he had allowed me to wait for unreceived Lady D one of the most delicateminded of women knowing too my  preferable regard for your brother And must not the  hurry  have the worse appearance for  that  No preparation yet thought of My aunt thinking his former urgency greatly as she honours him rather  too  precipitatingMy spirits hurried before were really affected Do not call me a silly girl dearest Lady G I endeavoured to speak but at the instant could not distinctly  I am sorry madam that what I have said has so much disturbed you Surely some one day in the fourteen  Indeed indeed Sir interrupted I you have surprised me I did not think you could have wished  so  to limit meI did not expect  What loveliest of women will you  allow  me to expect The day is still at your own choice Revoke not however the generous concession till Mrs Shirley Mrs Selby and our Lucy are consulted Will you dearest madam be determined by them  Say not Sir to any of them after such an instance of my confidence in youfor the honour of your accustomed generosity say it notthat you could so limit me and I will endeavour to forget it  Consider my dearest Miss Byron  I believe my grandmamma is come said I  They are all goodness They will indulge me I will tell you madam taking my hand and seating me what is my intention if you approve of it All the country suppose that my application for your favour meets with encouragement They expect as I have told you a speedy solemnization I took my lodgings at some little distance from you at a place of public entertainment perhaps pardon me madam for the sake of my ingenuousness with some view that the general talk See Lady G it is well he is a good man would help to accelerate my happy day But madam to continue my daily visits from thence when my happiness is supposed to be  near will not perhaps  look  so well We  are to be  studious of  looks  it seemsIndeed I would not be thought to despise the world's opinion The world when it will have patience to stay till it is master of facts is not always wrong It can judge of others better than it can act itselfThe change of my lodgings to others in this house or in Shirleymanor will not perhaps be allowed till I am blessed with the hand of the dearest relation of both I therefore think of going up to town  declaredly  Why not to prepare for our nuptials and to return near the time agreed upon for the happy celebration Then will either this house or Shirleymanor be allowed to receive the happiest of men  He stopt I was silent He proceeded looking tenderly yet smilingly in my downcast face still holding my handAnd now dearer to me than life let me ask youCan you think it an unpardonable intrusion on your condescending goodness that I make the time of my return to my Miss Byron not overtediousFourteen days were you to go to the extent of them would be an age to me who have been for so many days past the happiest man that a person in expectation can be I do assure you madam that I had not the insolence to suppose I was making you a request that was rather expected to be  forgiven  than complied with I thought myself not ungenerous to the confidence you reposed in me that I gave you  so much  time I thought of a  week  and began apologizing lest you should think it too short but when I saw you disturbed I concluded with the mention of a  fortnight  My dearest creature think me not unreasonable in my expectations of your compliance  What Sir in a fortnight  As to preparations madam you know the pleasure my sisters will have in executing any commissions you will favour them with on so joyful an occasion Charlotte had not  so much  time for preparation But were  not  everything to be in readiness by the chosen day there will be time enough for all you wish before you would perhaps choose to see companyConsider my dearest life that if you regard punctilio merely punctilio has no determinate end Punctilio begets punctilio You may not half a year hence imagine  that  to be sufficiently gratified Again I say Do  you  madam consider Let me adhere to the fourteen days and within them crown the hope you gave me  Within  themSir I did not expect  You tell me my beloved Miss Byron interrupted he what you did  not  expectTell me I beseech you mistress as you are of one of the noblest of female hearts what you  did  expect when you condescended to make me the compliment that were it to be carried into effect would engage my utmost gratitude  I had not thought of  any  particular time But I could  not  have made you that compliment had I thought of a day so  very  early  You have madam you  ought  to have the option Yet I own that your declared generous confidence in me had elated me The temptation was too great for me not to wish to make use of the power you had as I thought put into my hands And allow me to say that I cannot give up my hope till your grandmamma and aunt decide that I ought  How SirAnd can you thus adhereBut I will allow of your  reference    And be determined by their advice madam  But I will not trust you Sir with pleading your own cause  Are you not arbitrary madam  In this point if I am ought I  not  to be so  Yes if you will  resume  a power you had so generously resigned  May I  not  Sir when I think it overstrained in the hands of the person to whom in better hopes it was delegated  That dear Lady is the point to be tried You consent to refer the merits of it to your grandmamma and aunt  If I  do  Sir you ought not to call me  arbitrary  It is gracious bowing in my sovereign Lady to submit her absolute will and pleasure to arbitration  Very well SirBut will you not submit to  my own  award  Tell me dear Miss Byron tell me if I do how generous will you be  I was far from intending  Was  madamI hope I may dwell upon that word and repeat my question  Am  Sir I  am  far from intending  No more dear madam I appeal to another tribunal  Well Sir I will endeavour to recollect the substance of this conversation and lay it in writing before the judges you have named Lucy shall be one  You will permit me madam to see your state of the case before you lay it before the judges  No Sir None but they must see it till it makes part of a Letter to Lady G who then shall shew it only to Lady L  It is the harder to be thus prescribed to my dear Miss Byron because  What Sir in my day  That was what I was going to urge because  mine  will never come Every day to the end of my life will be yours Dear manOnly Sir as I  deserve  your kindness I wish not for it on other terms And you shall be then sole judge of my deserts I will not appeal to any other tribunal  He gracefully bowed I think said he smiling I must withdraw my intended appeal I am halfafraid of my judges and perhaps ought to rely wholly on your goodness  No no Sir Your  intention  is your  act  In  that  sense you have appealed to Caesar  Alluding to Festus's answer to St Paul Acts xxv  I never before was in Love with despotism You mention writing to my sisters You correspond with them I presume as you formerly did with  our  Lucy Let me tell you madam that you had not been  Miss Byron  FOURTEEN days after I was favoured with the sight of those Letters had I been at liberty to offer you my heart and could I have prevailed on you to accept it Your distress your noble frankness of heart  And let me own Sir as an instance of the frankness you are pleased to encourage that gratitude for the deliverance you so nobly gave me had as much power over  my  heart as the openness of mine and my distress could have over yours  Sweet excellenceComplete your generous goodness to a grateful heart it  is  a grateful one and shorten the days of your  single  power in order to enlarge it  Lucy appeared but seeing us engaged in conversation was about to retire But he stepping to her and taking both her handsOUR Lucy obligingly said he you must come inYou are to be one judge of three in a certain cause that will come before youAnd I hope  No prejudgings Sir Charles said IYou are not to plead at all  Yet deeply interested in the event Miss Selby said he  A bad sign cousin Byron said Lucy I begin already to doubt the justice of your cause  When you hear it Lucy make as you usually do the golden rule yours and I have nothing to fear  I tell you beforehand I am inclined to favour Sir Charles No three judges can be found but will believe from his character that  he  cannot be wrong  But from mine that  I  may O my Lucy I did not expect this from my cousin You must not I think be one of my judges  To this place I have shewn my three judges The following is their determination drawn up by the dear Lady president my grandmamma  Sir  Charles Grandison against  Harriet Byron Et é Contra  WE the underwritten do find upon the case laid before us by the said Harriet That in the whole conversation between the said Sir Charles and her she has behaved herself with that true virgin delicacy yet with that laudable unreservedness that might be expected from  her  character and  his  merits We think the gentleman has the advantage of the Lady in the arguments for the early day contended for and if she had defended herself by little artifices and disguises we should have had no scruple to decide against her But as she has shewn throughout the conversation noble instances of generosity trust reposed and even acknowleged affection we recommend to them both a compromise  We allow therefore Sir Charles Grandison to pursue his intentions of going up to town  declaredly  to prepare for the happy day and recommend it to Harriet in consideration of the merits of the requester who lays his whole heart open before her in a manner too generous not to meet with a like return to fix as early a day as in prudence she can  For the rest May the Almighty shower down his blessings on both May all their contentions like this be those of Love and true Delicacy May they live together many very many happy years an example of conjugal felicity And may their  exemplary virtues meet with an everlasting rewardSo prays so subscribes  HENRIETTA SHIRLEY  MARIANNE SELBY  LUCY SELBY  Tomorrow morning when Sir Charles comes to breakfast this paper will be presented to him by my grandmamma  I wonder whether Sir Charles writes to Dr Bartlett an account of what passes here If he does what would I give to see his Letters and particularly what he thinks of the little delays he meets with▪ But do dear Lady G acquit me of affectation and parade Indeed it is not that I hope he himself acquits me and censures himself for upon my word he is unreasonably hasty  I could not but express a little curiosity about his hint of Lady Olivia's favourable opinion of me tho' not at the time and he was so good as to shew me and my grandmamma and aunt a most extraordinary character which she gave me in a long Letter I saw it was a long Letter I was very  Eveish  my dear Lucy said afterwards that I did  so leer  at it An ugly word importing  sliness  and after I was angry at myself for giving her the idea that put her upon applying it I chid her for using it  Lady Olivia writes such high things my dear I blushedI did not could not deserve them I always pitied her you know but now you cannot imagine how much more than ever I pitied her Do all of us  indeed  as the men say love flatteryI did not think I didI shall find out all the  obliquities  of my heart in time I was supposed once to be so  good  a creatureas if none other were half so goodAh my partial friends you studied your Harriet in the dark but here comes the sun darting into all the  crooked and obscure corners of my heart and I shrink from his dazling eye and compared to Him and  Clementina  let me add appear to myself such a Nothing  Nay I have had the mortification once or twice to think myself less than the very Olivia upon whom but lately secure of my mind's superiority to her mind I looked down with a kind of proud compassion And whence this exaltation of Olivia and selfhumiliationWhy from her magnifying beyond measure the poor Harriet and yielding up her own hopes entreating him as she does to address me and that with such honourable distinction as if my acceptance of him were doubtful and a condescension  I wish I could procure you a copy of what your brother read to meAh my dear it is very soothing to my prideBut what is the  foundation  of that pride Is it not my ambition to be thought worthily of by the best of men And does not praise stimulate me to resolve to  deserve  praise I will  endeavour  to deserve it But my dear this Olivia a fine figure herself and loving in spite of discouragement can praise to the object of her Love the  person  and still more the  mind  of her rivalIs not that great in Olivia Could  I  be so great if I thought myself in danger from  her  LETTER XXX  Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Selbyhouse  Wedn Oct    SIR Charles came not this morning till we were all assembled for breakfast I had begun to think whether if I had been Sir Charles and he had been Miss Byron I would not have been here an hour before expecting the decision of the judges to whom a  certain cause was referred O my dear Lady G how narrow minded I am with all my quondam heroism The knowlege of his past engagements with the excellent Clementina and of his earnest wishes then to be hers makes me on every occasion that can be tortured into an appearance of neglect or coldness  so  sillyIndeed I am ashamed of myself But all my petulance was dispelled the instant he shone upon us  Well my dear Ladies said he the moment he took his place whisperingly to my grandmamma who sat between my aunt and Lucy Is sentence given  It is Sir CharlesHe took my hand cross my Nancy's lap as she sat between him and meI have hopes my dear Miss Byron from the foolishness in my looks I suppose that you are  cast  Have patience Sir said IIt is well that the best of us are not always to be our own carvers  He looked Lucy said afterwards with eyes of love upon me and of apprehension on his judges and the discourse turned upon different subjects  I retired as soon as breakfast was over and he demanded his sentence  My uncle was as he called it  turned out of door  before my grandmamma gave your brother the paper  Sir Charles read itYou are not serious upon it Sir Charles said my grandmammaI am infinitely obliged to you Ladies replied he I love to argue with my dear Miss Byron I must attend her this moment  He sent up Sally before him and came up I was in my closet and scrupled not to admit him  Henceforth my dearest dear Miss Byron said he the moment he approached me as I stood up to receive him I salute you undoubtedly mineAnd he saluted me with ardorI knew not which way to lookSo  polite  a Lover as I thought himYet never man was so gracefully freeIt remains now  madam proceeded he still holding my hand to put to trial your goodness to me You have done that already thought I in the greater question by which I am to conduct myself for the next week or ten days  Week  or  ten days  thought I Surely Sir you are an incroacher  You see Sir said I when a little recovered what judges who on such points as these cannot err have determined  Yes they  can  interrupted he As  Ladies  they are partiesBut I submit Their judgment must be a law to meI will go up to town as they advise I cannot however be long absent from you When I return I will not put up at a public place Either your uncle or your grandmother must allow me to be their guest This will oblige you I hope even for  dear  punctilio sake to honour me with your hand very soon after my return  He paused I was silent His first address had put me out Remember madam I said resumed he that I cannot be long absent You are above being governed by mere punctilio Add to the obligations your generous acceptance of me has laid me underWhy sighs my Angel It was my dear Lady G an involuntary sighFor the world I would not give you either sensible or lasting pain But if the same circumstances would make your nomination of a day as painful to you some time hence as now then bless me with as early a day as you CAN give me to express myself in the words of my judges  This Sir said I but I hesitated and looked down is one of the solemn points which precede one of the most solemn circumstances of my life You seem more in earnest for an early day than I could have expected When I have declared that affectation has no part in the more distant compliance I may be allowed by the nicest of my own Sex to lay open to a man so generous tho' so precipitating my whole heart Indeed  Sir it is wholly yoursI blushed as I felt and turned away my face It  was  a free declaration But I was resolved to banish affectation He bowed profoundly on my hand and kissed it Gratitude looked out in his eyes and appeared in his graceful manner tho' attentively silent  You was my deliverer proceeded I An esteem founded on gratitude the object so meritorious ought to set me above mere formsOur judges say that you have the advantage in the argument  I will lay no stress madam on this part of their judgment in my favourTo your goodness and to that so noblyacknowleged esteem I wholly refer myself  I myself think proceeded I that you have the advantage in the argumentAll that is in my power I would wish to do to oblige you  Condescending goodnessAgain he bowed on my hand  Do you think Sir  Why hesitates my Love  Do you think six weeks  Six ages my dearest dearest creatureSix weeks For Heaven's sake madamHe looked he spoke impatience  What can a woman who has owned your title to  expect  to be obliged saylet me at least ask and I unaffectedly hesitated a  month  Sirfrom this dayAnd that you will acknowlege yourself not perversely or weakly treated  He dropt on one knee and kissing my hand once twice thrice with rapture  Within  the month then I hopeI cannot live a month from youAllow me to return in the first fortnight of the month  O Sir and take up your residence with us on your return  Undoubtedly madamConsider SirDo you also dearest madam consider and banish me not from you for so very long a time  My heart  wanted  I thought to oblige him but to allow him to return sooner as he was to take up his abode with us what was that but in effect complying with his first proposal  Permit me Sir to retire Indeed you are too urgent  He asked my excuse but declared that he would not give up his humble plea  humble  he  called  it unless my grandmamma and aunt told him that he ought  On his leaving me to return to company below he presented me with four little boxes Accept my beloved Miss Byron said he of these trifles I received them not till this morning While I had the Day to  hope  from you my heart would not suffer me to offer them least you should suspect me mean enough to imagine an influence from them I oblige myself by the tender and I comply with custom which I am fond of doing whenever I can innocently do it But I know that you my dear Miss Byron value the heart more than a thousand times the value of theseMine madam is yours and will be yours to the end of my life  What could I sayMy heart on recollection reproaches me for my ungraceful acceptance I courtesied I was silly Sir Charles Grandison only can be present to every occasion  He  looked  as if my  not  refusing them was a favour more than equivalent to the value of the presents My dearest life said he on my putting them on my toilette how much you oblige meShall I conduct you to our friends below Will you acquaint your grandmamma and aunt with our debate and my bold expectation  I stood still He took my hand pressed it with his lips and with a reverence more than usually profound as if he had  received  instead of  conferred  a favour withdrew Never was a present so gracefully  made I cannot describe the grace with which he made it  My uncle it seems as soon as he went down asked him How we had settled the great affair My grandmamma and aunt in a breath as he paid his compliments to them asked him If their Harriet had been goodor as good as he expected  Miss Byron said he has taken more time than I could have wished she had A month she talks of  Has she complied so far said my grandmamma I am glad of it I was afraid she would have insisted upon more timeSo was I said my aunt But who can withstand Sir Charles Grandison Has the dear girl given you the very day Sir  No madam If she had I should have hoped it would have been considerably  within  the month As yet Ladies I hope it will  Nay Sir Charles if you are not pleased with a month said my auntHush dear LadiesHere comes the AngelNot a word I beseech you on that side of the questionShe will think if you applaud her that she has consented to too short a termYou must not make her uneasy with herself  Does not this look as if he imagined there was  room  for me to be soI  almost  wishI do'nt know what I wish except I could think but half so well of myself as I do of him For then should I look forward with less pain in my joy than now too often mingles with it  Your brother excused himself from dining with us That Greville has engaged him Why would he permit himself to be engaged by him Greville cannot love him He can only admire him and that everybody does who has been but once in his company Miss Orme even Miss Orme is in Love with him I received a note from her while your brother was with us These are the contents  Dear Miss  Byron  I AM in Love with your young Baronet It is well that your Beauty and your Merit secure you and make every other woman hopeless To see and know Miss Byron is half the cure unless a woman were presumption itself O my poor brotherBut will you let me expect you and as many of the dear family as you can bring at breakfast tomorrow morningSir Charles Grandison of course Shew your own obligingness to me and your power over him at the same time Your cousin Holles's will be with me and three sistertoasts of York besides  that  Miss Clarkson of whose Beauty and Agreeableness you have heard me talk They long to see you You  may  come Poor things how will they be mortified If any one of them can allow herself to be less lovely than the others she will be least affected by your superiority But let me tell you that Miss Clarkson had she the intelligence in her eyes that Somebody else has and the dignity with the ease would be as charming a young woman But we are all prepared I to love they to admire your gentleman Pray pray my dear bring him or the disappointment will kill  Your  KITTY ORME  Lucy acquainting Sir Charles with the invitation asked him if he would oblige Miss Orme He was at our command he saidSo we shall breakfast tomorrow at  The Park  But I am vexed at his dining with us today So little time to stay with us I wish him to be  complaisant  to Mr Greville but need he be so  very  obliging There are plots laying for his company all over the county We are told there is to be a numerous assembly all of gentlemen at Mr Greville's Mr  Greville humourously declares that he hates all women for the sake of one  WE have just opened the boxes O my dear Lady G your brother is either very proud or his fortune is very high Does he not say that he always consults fortune as well as degree in matters of outward appearance He has not in these presents I am sure consulted either the fortune or degree of your HarrietOf your  happy  Harriet I had like to have written But the word  happy  in this place would have looked as if I thought these jewels an addition to my happiness How does his bounty insult me on my narrow fortuneNarrow unless he submit to accept of the offered contributions of my dear friends  Contributions  Proud Harriet how art thou even in thy exaltation humbled  Trifles  he called them The very ornamenting one's self with such  toys  may in his eye be thought trifling tho' he is not above complying with the fashion in things indifferent But the cost and beauty of these jewels considered they are  not  trifles The jewel of jewels however is his heart How would the noble ClementinaHah  Pen  Heart rather Why why just now this check of  Clementina  I  know  whyNot from want of admiration of her but when I am allowing my heart to open then doesSomething  here  in my inmost bosom Is it Conscience strike me as if it said Ah HarrietTriumph not rejoice not Check the overflowings of thy grateful heartArt thou not an invader of another's right  LETTER XXXI  Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Thursday Morning Oct    I Will hurry off a few lines I am always ready before these fiddling girls Lucy and Nancy I mean Never tedious but in dressing They will overdo the morning appearance I could beat them So well acquainted with propriety as they are and knowing the beauty of elegant negligence Were I not afraid of Lucy's repartee and that she would say I was laying out for a compliment I would tell them they had a mind to try to eclipse Miss Clarkson and the Yorkshire Ladies Your brother  supped  as well as dined at that Greville's Fie upon him I did not think he had so little command of himselfVain Harriet Perhaps he  chose  to be rather  there  than  here  for  novelty  sake I shall be saucy byandby He is below strongly engaged in talk with my auntAbout  me  I suppose Ay to be sure methinks your Ladyship says He can talk of nobody elseWell and what if one would wish he  could  not  What are these girls about  No less than oneandtwenty gentlemen at Greville's besides the Prince of them all They all were ready to worship him Fenwick looked in just now and tells us so He says that your brother was the liveliest man in the company He led the mirth he says and visibly exerted himself the more finding the turn of the conversation likely to be what might be expected from such a company of all men Wretches Can twenty of them when met be tolerable creatures not a woman among them to soften their manners and give politeness to their conversationFenwick says they engaged him at one time into talk of different regions customs usages He was master of every subject Half a score mouths  were open at once whenever he spoke as if distended with  gags  was his word and every one's eyes broader than ever they were observed to be before Fenwick has humour a little Not much only by accident So unlike  himself  at times that he may pass for a different man His aping Greville helps his oddnessHow I ramble You'll think I am aping my dear Lady G Mocking's catching  O these girls  I think time lost when I am not writing to you You cannot imagine what a thief I am to my company I steal away myself and get down before I am missed half a score times in a couple of hours Sir Charles sung to the wretches They all sung They encored him without mercyHe talks of setting out for town on Saturday early Lord bless me what shall I  do  when he is goneDo you think  I  say this If I  do  I am kept in countenance Everybody says so as well as IBut ah Lady GHe has invited all the gentlemen the whole Twentyone and my cousin James and my uncle to dine with him at his inn tomorrow  Inn  nasty inn Why did we let him go thitherI am afraid he is a reveller Can he be so  very  good a man O yes yes yes wicked Harriet What is in thy heart to doubt it A fine reflexion upon the age as if there could not be  one  good man in it and as if a good man could not be a man of vivacity and spirit From whom can spirits can chearfulness can debonnairness be expected if not from a  good  manI will shew these girls by the quantity I have written how they have made me wait Prating I suppose to my Sally about Sir Charles They can talk of nobody else  Ready  Yes you dear creatures So you ought to have been a leaf and half of my writing agoAdieu Lady G till our return from Miss Orme's  Thursday Noon  JUST come back from Miss Orme's Sir Charles and my grandmamma are now got together in serious  talk I know I was the subject by the dear parent's looking often smiling upon me as I sat at distance and by his eyes taking the reference as I may call it of her's turned as often towards me so I stole up to my pen  We were very politely treated by Miss Orme Miss Clarkson is a charming young Lady The three Yorkshire sisters are lovely women Sir Charles has told us that mere Beauty attracts only his eyes as fine flowers do in a gay parterre I don't know  that  my dear That's the  philosophical  description of himself The  same  men and women are not always the  same  persons The Ladies one and all when his back was turned declared that he was the gallantest man they ever were in company with He said the easiest politest things they ever heard spokenThey never were in his company  before  They might else have heard  as  fine Such dignity they observed so does everybody yet so much ease in all he said as well as in his whole behaviour  Born  to be a public man would his pride permit him to aim at being soNot a syllable however but what might be said to each with the strictest truth Sir Charles Grandison It is Lucy's observation as well as mine addresses himself to women  as  women not as goddesses yet does honour to the persons and to the sex Other men not knowing what better to say make Angels of them all at once The highest things are ever said by men of the lowest understandings and their bolts once shot the poor souls can go no further So sillyHas not your Ladyship some of these in your eye who make out the rest by grinning in our faces in order to convince us of their  sincerity  Complimental men don't consider that if the women they egregiously flatter were what they would have them believe they think them they would not be seen in such company  But what do you think the elder sister of the three  said of your brotherShe was sure those eyes and that vivacity and politeness were not given him for nothing  Given him for nothing  What a phrase is that In short she said that  practice  had improved his natural advantages  This  I have a good mind to say of  her  Either she had not charity or her heart has paid for enabling its mistress to make such an observation  Practice  What meant she by the wordIndeed your brother was not quite so  abstractedly  inattentive  I  thought to the Beauty of Miss Clarkson but he might give some  little shadow  of ground for observation to a censorious person  I sometimes think that free and open as his eyes are his character might suffer if one were to judge of his heart by them Lord L I remember once said that Ladies abroad used to look upon him as their own man the moment they beheld himInnocently so no doubt and in their conversationassemblies Poor Lady Olivia I suppose was so caught at an unhappy moment perhaps when her caution was halfasleep and she was loth to have it too rudely awakened But ought I your Harriet to talk of thisWhere was  my  caution when I suffered  myself  to be surprisedO but my  gratitude  was my excuse Who knows what Olivia might have to pleadWe have not her whole story you know Poor Lady I pity her To cross the seas as she didIneffectually  But can you bear this penprattling the effects of a mind more at ease than it ever expected to be  I will go down  Can  I be so long spared I am just thinking that were I one of the creatures called Coquettes the best way to attract attention when it grew languid is to do as I do from zeal in writing to youBe always going out and returning and not staying long enough in a place to tire one's company or suffer them to turn their eyes upon anybody else Did  you  ever try such an experiment Charlotte But  you never  could  tire your company Yet I think you have a spice of that character in yours Don't you think so yourselfBut don't own it if you doHeyday What's the matter with me I believe by my flippancy I am growing quite well and as saucy as I used to bePoor Lady Clementina I wish she were happy Then should I be so  MY dear Lady G we had a charming conversation this day My grandmamma and your brother bore the principal parts in it It began with dress and fashion and suchlike trifling subjects but ended in the noblest You know my grandmamma's chearful piety Sir Charles seemed at first only designing to attend to her wisdom but she drew him in O my dear he seems to be yet not to know it as good a man as she is a woman Yet years so differentBut austerity uncharitableness on one hand ostentation affectation on the other these are qualities which can have no place in his heart Such a glorious benevolence Such enlarged sentimentsWhat a happy thrice happy woman thought I several times must she be who shall be considered as a partaker of his goodness Who shall be blest not only  in  him but  for  him and be his and he hers to all eternity  My aunt once in the conclusion of this conversation said How happy would it be if he could reform certain gentlemen of this neighbourhood And as they were so fond of his company she hoped he would attempt it  Example he answered and a  silent  one would do more with such men than  precept They have Moses and the prophets  They know when they do wrong and what is right They would be afraid of and affronted at a man pretending to instruct them Decency from such men is as much as can be expected We live in such an age added he that I believe more  good may be done by seeming to relax a little than by strictness of behaviour Yet I admire those who from a full persuasion of their duty do  not  relax and the more if they have got above moroseness austerity and uncharitableness  After dinner Mr Milbourne a very good man minister of a Dissenting congregation in our neighbourhood accompanied by Dr Curtis called in upon us They are good friends made so by the mediation of my grandmamma some years ago when they did  not  so well understand each other Dr Curtis had been with us more than once since Sir Charles was our visiter He greatly admires him you need not doubt It was beautiful after compliments had passed between Sir Charles and the gentlemen to see the  modest man  shine out in your brother's behaviour Indeed he was free and easy but attentive as expecting entertainment and instruction from  them  and leading  each  of them to give it in his own way  They staid but a little while and when they were gone Sir Charles said He wanted no other proof of their being good men than they gave by their charity and friendship to each other My uncle who you know is a zealous man  for the Church  speaking a little severely of persons whom he called  Scismatics  O Mr Selby said Sir Charles let us be afraid of prescribing to tender consciences You and I who have been abroad in countries where they account us  worse  than Schismatics would have been loath to have been prescribed to or compelled in articles for which we ourselves are only answerable to the common Father of us all▪  I believe in my conscience Sir Charles replied my uncle if the truth were known you are of the mind of that King of Egypt who said He looked upon the diversity of religions in his kingdom with as much pleasure as he did on the diversity of flowers in his garden  I remember not the name of that King of Egypt Mr Selby but I am  not  of his mind I should not if I were a king take  pleasure  in such a diversity But as the  examples  of Kings are of great force I would by making my own as faultless as I could let my people see the excellence of my persuasion and my uniform practical adherence to it instead of discouraging erroneous ones by unjustifiable severity Religious zeal is generally a fiery thing I would as soon quarrel with a man for his Face as for his Religion A good man if not overhated by zeal  will be  a good man whatever be his faith and should always be intitled to our esteem as he is to our good offices as a fellowcreature  The  Methodists  Sir Charles What think you of the  Methodists  Say you love 'em and and and addsdines you shall not be my nephew  You now my dear Mr Selby make me afraid of you You throw out a menace the  only  one you could perhaps think of that would make me temporize  You need not you need not be afraid Sir Charles said my uncle laughing What say  you  Harriet  Need  he Hay looking in my downcast face Why speak you not  lovely Love  Need Sir Charles if he  had  disobliged  me  to have been  afraid  Hay  Dear Sir you have not of a long time been so  So  what  Harriet So  what  dearest looking me quite down  Fie Mr Selby said my grandmamma Sir Charles stepping to me very gallantly took my handO Mr Selby you are not kind said he But allow me to make my advantage of your unkindness My dear Miss Byron let you and I withdraw in compassion to Mr Selby let us withdraw We will not hear him chidden as I see the Ladies think he ought to be  And he hurried me off The surprize made me appear more reluctant than I was in my heart  Every one was pleased with his air and manner and by this means he relieved himself from subjects with which he seemed not delighted and obtained an opportunity to get me to himself  Here  had he stopt he would have been welcome But hurrying me into the Cedarparlour I am jealous my Love said he putting his arm round me You seemed loth to retire with me Forgive me But thus I punish you whenever you give me cause And dear Lady G he downright kissed meMy lip and not my cheekand in so fervent a wayI tell you everything my CharlotteI could have been angryhad I known  how  from surprize Before I could recollect myself he withdrew his arm and resuming his usual respectful air it would have made me look affected had I then taken notice of it But I don't remember any instance of the like freedom used to Lady Clementina  My  lovely Love  said he to express myself in your uncle's stile which is that of my heart tell me Can you have pity for a poor man when he is miserable who on a certain occasion shewed  you  none See what a Letter Sir Hargrave Pollexfen has written to Dr Bartlett who asks my advice about attending him  I obtained leave to communicate it to you my dear Ladies Be pleased to return it to me I presume you will read it here  Dear Dr  Bartlett  CAN your company be dispensed with by the best of men for one two three daysI have not had a happy hour since I saw you and Sir Charles Grandison at my house on the Forest All is gloom and horror in my mind My despondency is must be of the blackest kind It is blacker than remorse It is all repining but no repentance I cannot cannot repent Lord God of Heaven and Earth what a  wretch am I with such a fortune such estates I am rich as Craesus yet more miserable than the wretch that begs his bread from door to door and who oftener meets repulses than relief What a glorious choice has your patron made Youth unbroken conscience his friend he cannot know an enemy O that I had lived the life of your patron I cannot see a creature who does not extol him My winemerchant's name is DanbyGood God What stories does he tell of him Lord Jesus What a heart must he have that would permit him to do such things as Danby reports of him of his own knowlege While IAs young a man as himself for what I knowWith power to do good as great perhaps greater than his ownLord Lord Lord what a hand have I made of it for the last three or four years of my life who might have reached Threescoreandten with comfort whereas now at Twentyeight I am on the very brink of the grave It appears to me as ready dug It yawns for me I am neither fit to die nor to live My days are dreadful My nights are worse My bed is a bed of nettles and not of down Not one comfortable thought not one good action to revolve in which I had not some vile gratification to promote Wretched man It is come home to me with a vengeance  You prayed by me You prayed for me I have not been so happy sinceCome and make me easyhappy I can never be in this worldFor pity for charity sake come and teach me how to bear life or how to prepare for its cessation And if Sir Charles Grandison would make me one more visit would personally join in prayer with you and me a glimpse of comfort would once more dart in upon my mind  Try your interest with him my dear Sir in my behalf and come together Where is heThe great God of Heaven and Earth prosper to him all his wishes be he where he will and be they what they  will Everybody will find their account in his prosperity But I what use have I made of the prosperity given meMerceda gone to his account Bagenhall undone Jordan shunning me Narrowsoul'd Jordan He is reformed but not able to divide the  man  from the  crime  he thinks he cannot be in earnest but by hating both God help me I cannot now if I would give him a bad example He need not be afraid of my staggering him in his good purposes  One favour for God's sake procure for meIt s that the man whose life once I sought and thought myself justified by the provocation who afterwards saved mine for a  time  saved it reserved as I was for pains for sufferings in mind and body worse than deathThat  this  man will be the Executor of my last Will I have not a friend left My relations are hungering and watching for my death as birds of prey over a field of battle My next heirs are my worst enemies and most hated by me Dear Sir Charles Grandison my deliverer my preserver from those bloody Frenchmen if you are the good man I think you complete your kindness to him whom you have preserved and say you will be his Executor I  will  because I  must  do justice to the pretensions of those who will rejoice over my remains and I will leave you a discretionary power in articles wherein you may think I have shewn hatred For justicesake then be my Executor And do you good Bartlett put me in the way of repentance and I shall then be happy Draw me up dear Sir a Prayer that shall include Confusion You cannot suppose me too bad a man in a Christian sense Thank God I am a Christian in belief tho' I have been a Devil in practice You are a heavenlyminded man give me words which may go to my heart and tell me what I shall say to my God  Tell Sir Charles Grandison that he  owes  to me the service I request of him For if he had not interposed  so hellishly as he did on Hounslowheath I had been the husband of Miss Byron in two hours and she would have thought it her duty to reform me And by the Great God of Heaven I swear it was my intention to be reformed and to make her if I could have had but her  Civility  tho' not her  Love  the best of husbands Lord God of Heaven and Earth what a happy man had I then beenThen had I never undertaken that damned expedition to France which I have rued ever since Let your patron know how much I owe to him my unhappiness and he will not in justice deny any reasonable any honest request that I shall make him  Lord help me What a long Letter is here My Soul complains on paper I do nothing but complain It will be a relief if your patron and you will visit will pray for will pity  The most miserable of men HARGRAVE POLLEXFEN  Your brother's eye followed mine as I read I frequently wept In a soothing tender and respectful manner he put his arm round me and taking my own handkerchief unresisted wiped away the tears as they fell on my cheek These were his soothing words as my bosom heaved at the dreadful description of the poor man's misery and despair Sweet humanityCharming sensibilityCheck not the kindly gushDewdrops of Heaven wiping away my tears and kissing the handkerchiefDewdrops of Heaven from a mind like that Heaven mild and graciousPoor Sir HargraveI will attend him  You  will  Sir That is very good of youPoor man What a hand as he says has he made of it  A hand indeed repeated Sir Charles his own benign eyes glistening  And will you be his Executor SirYou will I hope  I will do anything that my dear Miss Byron wishes me to do anything that may comfort the poor man if indeed he has not a person in whom he  ought  to confide whether he is  willing  to do so or not My endeavour shall be to reconcile him to his relations Perhaps he hates them because they are likely to be his heirs I have known men capable of such narrowness  When we came to the place where the unhappy man mentions my having been likely to be his in two hours time a chilness came over my heart I shuddered Ah Sir said I how grateful ought I to be to  my  deliverer  Everamiable goodness resumed he How have I been how am I how shall I be rewardedWith tender awe he kissed my cheekForgive me Angel of a woman A man can shew his Love but  as  a man Your heart is the heart I wish it to be Love Humanity Graciousness Benevolence Forgiveness all the amiable qualities which can adorn the Female mind are in perfection yours Be your Sisterexcellence happy God grant it and I shall be the happiest man in the world You madam who can pity your oppressor when in misery can allow of my grateful remembrance of that admirable woman  Your tender remembrance of Lady Clementina Sir will ever be grateful to meGod Almighty make her happyfor your sake for the sake of your dear Jeronymo and for mine  There spoke Miss Byron and Clementina both in one Surely you two are informed by one mind What is distance of countries What obstacles can there be to dissever Souls so paired  But Sir  Must  Clementina be  compelled  to marry  Must  the woman who has loved Sir Charles Grandison who stills avows her Love and only prefers her God to him be  obliged  to give her hand to another man  Would to Heaven that her friends tender indulgent as they have always been to her would not drive too fast But how can I of all men remonstrate to them in this case when they think nothing is wanting to obtain her compliance but the knowlege that she never  can  be mine  O Sir you shall  still  call her yours if the dear Lady changes her resolution and  wishes  to be so  Ought  you not  And  could  Miss Byron  She  could  she  would  interrupted IYet dear very dear I am not ashamed to own it would now the resignation cost me  Exalted loveliness  I never but by such a trial can be as great as ClementinaThen could  I  as  she  does take comfort in the brevity of human life Never never would  I  be the wife of any other man And shall the  nobler  Clementina be compelled  Good God lifting by his hands and eyes With what noble minds hast thou distinguished these two womenIs it for this madam that you wish to wait for the next Letters from Italy I have owned before that I presumed not to declare myself to you till I was sure of Clementina's adherence to a resolution so nobly taken We will however expect the next Letters My situation has not been happy Nothing but the consciousness of my own integrity excuse madam the seeming boast and a firm trust in Providence could at certain times have supported me  My mind my Charlotte seemed too high wrought Seeing me much disturbed he resumed the subject of Sir Hargrave's Letter as a somewhat lessaffecting one You see my dearest Miss Byron said he a kind of necessity for my hastening up Another melancholy occasion offers Poor Sir Harry Beauchamp desires to see me before he diesWhat a chequered life is thisI received Sir Hargrave's Letter to Dr  Bartlett and this intimation from my Beauchamp by a particular dispatch just before I came hither I grudge the time I must lose tomorrow But we must make some sacrifices to good neighbourhood and civility Poor Greville had a view by inviting all his neighbours and me to let himself down with a grace in a certain case He made a merit of his resignation to me before all the company every one of which admired my dear Miss Byron Well received as I was by every gentleman then present I could not avoid inviting them in my turn but I will endeavour to recover the time Have I your approbation madam for setting out on Saturday morning earlyI am afraid I must borrow of the Sunday some hours on my journey But visiting the sick is an act of mercy  You will be so engaged tomorrow Sir said I with your numerous guests and my uncle and cousin James will add to the number that I suppose we shall hardly see you before you set out early as you say that will be on Saturday morning  He said He had given orders already and for fear of mistakes should inforce them tonight for the entertainment of his guests and he would do himself the pleasure of breakfasting with us in the morningDear Lady Clementina forgive meI shall not I am afraid know how to part with him tho' but for a few weeksHow could you let him depart from  you  you knew not but it would be for everBut you are a wonder of a womanI am at least at this present writing a poor creature compared to you  I asked his leave to shew my grandmamma and aunt and my Lucy as well as his two sisters Sir Hargrave's Letter He wished that they  only  should see it  The perusal cost the three dear friends just named some tears My grandmamma Lucy tells me for I was writing to you when they read it made some fine observations upon the different situations in which the two gentlemen find themselves at this time I myself  could not but recollect the gay fluttering figure that the poor Sir Hargrave made at Lady Betty William's perpetually laughing and compare it with the dark scene he draws in the Letter before me all brought about in so short a space  There are I am told  worse  men than this Were those who are but  as bad  to be apprized of the circumstances of Sir Hargrave's story as fully as we know them would they not reflect and tremble at his sate even tho' that of Merceda whose exit I am told was all horror and despair and of the unhappy Bagenhall were not taken into the shocking account  This last wretch it seems his spirits and constitution both broken is gone nobody knows whither having narrowly escaped in person from an execution that was out against him body and goods the latter all seized upon his wife and an unhealthy child and she big with another turned out of doors a mortgagee in possession of his estate The poor woman wishing but for means to transport herself and child to her mean friends at Abbeville a collection set on foot in her neighbourhood for that purpose failing for the poor man was neither beloved nor pitied  These particulars your brother's trusty Richard Saunders told my Sally and in confidence that your brother a little before he came down being acquainted with her destitute condition sent her by him twenty guineas He never saw a deeper scene of distress he said  The poor woman on her knees received the bounty blessed the donor owned herself reduced to the last shilling and that she thought of applying to the parish for assistance to carry her over  Sir Charles staid not to supper My grandmamma being desirous to take leave of her favourite in the morning has been prevailed upon to repose here tonight  I must tell you my Charlotte all my fears my  feelings my follies You are  now  you know my Lucy Something arises in my heart that makes me uneasy I cannot account to myself for this great and sudden change of behaviour in Greville His extraordinary civilities even to fondness to your brother Are they consistent with his blustring character and constant threatnings of any man who was likely to succeed with me A turn of behaviour so sudden Sir Charles and he in a manner strangers but by characterAnd did he not so far prosecute his menaces as to try wicked wretch what bluster and a drawn sword would do and smart for it Must not that disgrace incense himMy uncle says he cannot be a true spirit witness his compromise with Fenwick after a rencounter which being reported to be on my account had like to have killed me at the time And if not a true spirit may he not be treacherous God preserve your Brother from all secret as well as open attacks And do you my dear Ladies forgive the tender folly of  Your  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XXXII  Miss  BYRON  In continuation  Friday Morn Eight o'Clock October    THE apprehensions with which I was so weak as to trouble you in the conclusion of my last laid so fast hold of my mind that going immediately from my pen to my rest I had it broken and disturbed by dreadful shocking wandering dreams The terror they gave me several times awakened me but still as I closed my eyes I fell into them again Whence my dear proceed these ideal vagaries which for the time realize pain or pleasure to us according to their hue or complexion or rather according to our own  But such  contradictory  vagaries never did I know in my slumbers Incoherences of incoherenceFor exampleI was married to the best of men I was  not  married I was rejected with scorn as a presumptuous creature I sought to hide myself in holes and corners I was dragged out of a subterraneous cavern which the sea had made when it once broke bounds and seemed the dwelling of howling and conflicting winds and when I expected to be punished for my audaciousness and for repining at my lot I was turned into an Angel of light stars of diamonds like a glory encompassing my head A dear little baby was put into my arms Once it was Lucy's another time it was Emily's and at another time Lady Clementina'sI was fond of it beyond expression  I again dreamed I was married Sir Charles again was the man He did not love me My grandmamma and aunt on their knees and with tears besought him to love their child and pleaded to him my love of him of long standing begun in gratitude and that he was the only man I ever loved O how I wept in my dream My face and bosom were wet with my real tears  My sobs and my distress and  theirs  awakenod me but I dropt asleep and fell into the very same resverie He upbraided me with being the cause that he had not Lady Clementina He said and  so  sternly I am sure he cannot look so sternly that he thought me a much better creature than I proved to be Yet methought in my own heart I was not altered I fell down at his feet I called it my misfortune that he could not love me I would not say it was his fault It might perhaps be his misfortune tooAnd then I said Love and Hatred are not always in one's power If you cannot love the poor creature who kneels before you  that  shall be a cause sufficient with me for a divorce I desire not to fasten myself on the man who cannot love me Let me be divorced from you Sir  You shall be at liberty to assign any cause for the separation but  crime  I will bind myself never never to marry again but you shall be freeAnd God bless you and her you can love better than your poor HarrietFool I weep as I writeWhat a weak creature I am since I have not been well  In another part of my resverie he loved me dearly but when he nearly approached me or I him he always became a ghost and flitted from me Scenes once changed from England to Italy from Italy to England Italy I thought was a dreary wild covered with snow and pinched with frost England on the contrary was a country glorious to the eye gilded with a sun not too fervid the air perfumed with odours wafted by the most balmy Zephyrs from orangetrees citrons myrtles and jessamines In Italy at one time Jeronymo's wounds were healed at another they were breaking out afresh Mr Lowther was obliged to fly the country Why did not appear There was a fourth brother I thought and he taking part with the cruel Laurana was killed by the General Father Marescotti was at one time a martyr for his Religion at another a Cardinal and talked of for Pope  But still what was more shocking and which so terrified me that I awoke in a horror which put an end to all my resveries for I slept no more that nightSir Charles I thought was assassinated by Greville Greville fled his country for it and became a vagabond a Cain the Accursed I thought of God and ManI your poor Harriet a widow left in the most calamitous circumstance that a woman can be inGood HeavenBut avaunt recollectionPainful  most  painful recollection of ideas so terrible none of your intrusions  No more of these horrid horrid incongruities will I trouble you with How have they run away with me I am hardly now recovered from the tremblings into which they threw me  What my dear is the reason that tho' we know these dreams these fleeting shadows of the night to be no more than  dreams  illusions of the working mind fettered and debased as it is by the organs through which it conveys its confined powers to the grosser matter body then sleeping inactive as in the shades of death yet that we cannot help being strongly impressed by them and meditating interpretation of the flying vapours when reason is broad awake and tells us that it is weakness to be disturbed at themBut Superstition is more or less I believe in every mind a natural defect Happily poised is that mind which on the one hand is too strong to be affected by the slavish fears it brings with it and on the other runs not into the contrary extreme Scepticism the parent of infidelity  You cannot imagine my dear the pleasure I had the more for my various dream when your brother so amiably serene Love Condescension Affability shining in his manly countenance alighted as I saw him through my window at the same time I had the call to breakfastDear Sir I could have said Have not you been disturbed by cruel perplexing contradictory visions Souls may be near when Bodies are distant But are we not one Soul Could yours be unaffected when mine was so much disturbedBut thank God you are come Come safe unhurt pleased with me My fond arms were the ceremony passed should welcome you to your Harriet I would tell you all my disturbances from the absurd illusions of the past night and my mind should gather strength from the confession of its weakness  He talked of setting out early tomorrow morning His first visit he said should be to Sir Harry Beauchamp his next to Sir Hargrave Pollexfen Poor Sir Harry he said and sighed for him  Tenderhearted man as Clementina often called your brother he pitied Lady Beauchamp His poor  BeauchampThe loss of a father he said where a great estate was to descend to the son was the test of a noble heart He could answer for the sincerity of his Beauchamp's grief on this trying occasion Of what joy said he sitting between two of the best of women equally fond of him speaking low was I was  my  father deprived He had allowed me to think of returning to the arms of his paternal love I make no doubt but on looking into his affairs his son perhaps his steward he would have done for his daughters what I have done for my sisters We should both of us have had a new life to begin and pursue A happy one from my duty and his indulgence it must have been I had planned it outWith all humility I would by degrees have laid it before him first one part then another as his condescension would have countenanced me  Vile vile resveriesMust not this young man be the peculiar care of Heaven How could my disturbed imagination terrify me but in a dream that the machinations of the darkest mind as his must be Greville is not so bad a man who could meditate violence against virtue so sacredly guarded could be permitted to prevail against his life  My grandmamma once with tears in her eyes as he talked of taking leave laid her hand upon his and instantly withdrew it as if she thought the action too free He took her hand and with both his lifted it to his lipsVenerable goodness he called her She looked  so  proud and  so  comforted every one  so  pleasedIt is a charming thing to see blooming youth fond of declining age  They dropt away one by one and I found myself left alone with him Sweetly tender was his address to me How shall I part with my Harriet said he My eyes were ready to overflow By a twinkling motion I thought to disperse over the whole eye the selffelt too ready tear My upperlip had the motion  in it throbbing like the pulsation which we call the lifebloodI was afraid to speak for fear of bursting into a fit of tenderness yet was conscious that my very silence was more expressive of tenderness than speech could have been With what delight did his eager eye as mine nowandthen glancing upward discovered meditate my downcast face and silent concern Yet such was his delicacy that he took not that notice of it in words which if he had would have added to my confusion It was enough for him that he saw it As he was contented  silently  to enjoy the apparent affection I am not sorry he  did  see it He merited even open and unreserved assurances of Love But I the sooner recovered my spirits for his delicate nonobservance I could not circumstanced as we were say I  wished  for his speedy return yet my dear my purest wishes were that he would not be long absent My grandmamma pleases herself with having the dear man for her inmate on his return There is therefore no need for the sake of the world's speech to abridge my month yet  ought  we to be shy of giving consequence to a man who through delicacy is afraid to let us see that he assumes consequence from our speechless tenderness for himHe restored me to speech by a change of subject  Two melancholy offices shall I have to perform said he before I have the honour to attend again my dearest Miss Byron What must be the heart that melts not at another's woeAs to Sir Hargrave I don't apprehend that he is near his end as is the case of poor Sir Harry Sir Hargrave labours under bodily pains from the attack made upon him in France and from a constitution ruined perhaps by riot And having nothing of consolation to give himself from reflexion on his past life as we see by his Letter his fears are too strong for his hopes But shall I tell him if I find it will give him comfort that  you  wish his recovery and are sorry for his indisposition Small  crevices let in light sometimes upon a benighted imagination He must consider his attempt upon your freewill tho' not meant upon your honour as one of the enormities of his past life  I was overpowered with this instance of his generous goodness Teach me Sir to be good to be generous to be forgivinglike youBid me do what you think proper for me to doSay to the poor man whose insults upon you in his challenge were then my terror O how much my terror in my name say all that you think will tend to give him consolation  Sweet excellence Did I ever hope to meet in woman with such an enlargement of heartClementina only of all the women I ever knew can be set in comparison with you And  had  she been granted to me the union of minds between us from difference of Religion could not have been so perfect as yours and mine must be  Greatly gratified as I was by the compliment I was sorry methought that it was made me at the expence of my Sex His words  'Did I ever hope to meet in woman with such an enlargement of heart'  piqued me a little Are not women as capable as men thought I of enlarged sentiments  The leave he took of me was extremely tender I endeavoured to check my sensibility He departed with the blessings of the whole family as well as mine I was forced to go up to my closet I came not down till near dinnertime I  could  not and yet my uncle accompanied my cousin James to Northhampton So that I had no apprehensions of his raillery One  wants  trials sometimes I believe to make one support one's self with some degree of  outward  fortitude at least Had my uncle been at home I should not have dared to have given so much way to my concern But soothing and indulgence sometimes I believe add to our imbecility of mind instead of strengthening our reason  MY uncle made it near eleven at night before he returned with my cousin James Not one of the company at his quitting it seemed inclinable to move He praised the elegance of the entertainment and the ease and chearfulness even to vivacity of Sir Charles How  could  he be so livelyHow many ways have men to divert themselves when anything arduous attacks themWhile we poor womenBut your towndiversionsYour Ranelaghs Vauxhallsbid fair to divert such of us as can carry ourselves out of ourselvesYet are we likely to pay dear for the privilege since we thereby render our Sex cheap in the eyes of men harden our fronts and are in danger of losing that modesty at least of  outward  behaviour which is the characteristic of women  Saturday Morning  HE is gone Gone indeed Went early this morning Every mouth was last night it seems full of his praises The men admire him as much as the women I am glad of it methinks since that is an indirect confession that there are few among them like him Not so much superiority over our Sex therefore in the other in general with their  enlarged hearts  Have not we a Clementina a Mrs Shirley and a long cI praise  you  not my dear Lady L and Lady G to your faces so I leave the c untranslated We do  so  look upon one another here Are  so  unsatisfied with ourselves We are not half so good company as we were  before  Sir Charles came among us How can that be But my Grandmamma has left us toothat's one thing She is retired to Shirleymanor to mortify after so rich a regale Those were her words  I hope your brother will write to us Should I not have asked him To be sure he will except his next Letters from Italy should beBut no doubt he will  write to us Mr Greville vows to my uncle he will not come near me He can less and less he says bear to think of my marrying tho' he does what he can to comfort himself with reflecting on the extraordinary merit of the man who alone he says can deserve me He wishes the day were over and the Dl's in him he adds if the irrevocableness of the event does not cure him Mr Fenwick had yesterday his final answer from Lucy and he is to set out on Monday for Carlisle He declares that he will not return without a wife So thank Heaven his heart is whole notwithstanding his double disappointment  BUT my heart is set on hearing how the excellent Clementina takes the news of your brother's actual address and probability of succeeding I should not think it at all suprising if urged as she is to marry a man indifferent to her the Lord of her heart unmarried she should retractO my CharlotteWhat a variety of strange strange WhatshallIcall them would result from such a retractation and renewal of claim I never thought myself superstitious but the happiness before me is so much beyond my merit that I can hardly flatter myself at times that it will take place  WHAT think you my dear made me write so apprehensivelyMy aunt had just shewn me a Letter she had written to youdesiring youto exercise for us your fancy your judgment I have no affectation on this subjectI long ago gave affectation to the windsBut so hastySo undoubtingAre there not many possibilities and some probabilities against usSomething presumptuousLord bless me my dear should anything happenJewels bought and already presentedAppareHow would all these preparations aggravate My aunt says he  shall  be obliged Lucy Nancy the Miss Holles's join with  her They long to be exercising their fancies upon the patterns which they suppose your Ladyship and Lady L will send down My uncle hurries my aunt So as  something  is going forward he says he shall be easy There is no resisting so strong a tide So let them take their course They are all in haste my dear to be considered as relations of your family and to regard all yours as kindred of ours Happy happy the band that shall tie both families together  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XXXIII  Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  To Miss  BYRON  London  Monday Night Oct    YOUR humanity my dear and everdear Miss Byron was so much engaged by the melancholy Letter of Sir Hargrave to Dr Bartlett which I communicated to you and by the distress of my Beauchamp on the desperate state of his father's health that I know you will be pleased to hear that I have been enabled to give some consolation to both  Sir Harry who is in town wanted to open his mind to me with regard to some affairs which made him extremely uneasy and which he said he could not reveal to anybody else He shewed some reluctance to entrust the secrets to  my  bosom There shall they ever rest He has found himself easier since He rejoiced to me on the good understanding subsisting and likely to subsist between his Lady and Son He desired me to excuse him for joining me with them without asking my leave in the trusts created by his Will And on this occasion sending for his Lady he put her hand in mine and recommended her and her interests as those of the most obliging of wives to my care  I found Sir Hargrave at his house in CavendishSquare  He is excessively lowspirited Dr Bartlett visited him at Windsor several times The Doctor prevailed on him to retain a worthy clergyman as his chaplain  The poor man asked after you madam He had heard he said that I was soon likely to be the happiest of men Was it so He wept at my answer lamented the wretched hand as he called it that  he  had made of it blessed as he was with such prosperous circumstances in the prime of youth and wished he had his days to come over again and his company to choose Unhappy man He was willing to remove from  himself  the load which lay upon him No doubt but this was the recourse of his companions likewise in extremity He blessed my dearest Miss Byron when I told him she pitied him He called himself by harsh and even shocking names for having been capable of offending so much goodness  What subjects are these to entertain my Angel withBut tho' we should not  seek  yet we ought not perhaps to  shun  them when they naturally as I may say offer themselves to our knowlege  But  another  subject calls for the attention of my dearest loveliest of women A subject that will lay a still stronger claim to it than either of the solemn ones I have touched upon I inclose the Letter which contains it You will be so good as to read it in English to such of our friends as read not Italian  This Letter was left to Mrs Beaumont to dispatch to me whence its unwishedfor delay For she detained it to send with it an equallyobliging one of her own The contents of this welcome Letter my dearest Miss Byron will render it unnecessary to wait for an answer to my last to Signor Jeronymo in which I acquaint him with my actual address and the hopes I presume to flatter myself with I humbly hope you will think so  I am not afraid that one of the most generous of  women will be affected with the passage in which Signor Jeronymo expresses his pity for her because of the affection he says I must ever retain for his noble sister  See p  He says right And it is my happiness that you the sisterexcellence of the admirable Clementina will allow me to glory in my  gratitude  to her You will still more readily allow me so to do when you have perused this Letter Shall not the man who hopes to be qualified for the Supreme Love of which the purest Earthly is but a type and who aims at an universal benevolence be able to admire in the mind of Clementina the same great qualities which shine out with such lustre in that of Miss Byron  With what pride do I look forward to the visit that several of this noble family intend to make us because of the  unquestionable  assurance that they will rejoice in my happiness and admire the Angel who is allowed to take place in my affections of the Angel who would not have scrupled to accept of my vows had it not been as she expresses herself  See p  for the  intervention of invincible obstacles  Mrs Beaumont in her Letter gives me the particulars of the conversation between her and Clementina almost in the same words with those of Jeronymo in the Letter inclosed She makes no doubt that Lady Clementina will in time yield to the entreaties of her friends in favour of a man against whom if she can be prevailed upon to forego her wishes to assume the veil she can have no one objection You will see madam by the inclosed what they hope for in Italy from us what Clementina what Jeronymo what a whole excellent family hope for You know how ardently my  own  family wish you to accelerate the happy day Yours refer themselves wholly to youPardon me my dearest Miss Byron I will tell you what are my hopesThey are  that when I am permitted to return to Northamptonshire the happy day shall not be postponed  three  And now loveliest and dearest of women allow me to expect the honour of a line to let me know how much of the tedious month from last Thursday you will be so good as to abate Permit me to say that I can have nothing that needs to detain me from the beloved of my heart after Friday next  If madam you insist upon the  whole  month I beg to know out of what part of our nuptial life the LAST or the FIRST happy as I hope it will be you would be willing to deduct the week the fortnight that will be carried into the blank space of courtship by the delay I hope my dear Miss Byron that I shall be able to tell  you  years and years after we are ONE that there is not an hour of those past or of those to come that I would abate or wish to throw into that  blank  Permit me so to call it The days of courtship cannot be  our  happiest Who celebrates the day of their first acquaintance tho' it may be remembred with pleasureDo not the happy pair date their happiness from the day of marriage How justly then when hearts are  assured  when minds  cannot alter  are those which precede it to be deemed a blank  After all your  chearful  compliance with my wishes is the great desireable Whatever shall be your pleasure must determine me My utmost gratitude will be engaged by the condescension  whenever  you shall distinguish the day of the year distinguished as it will be to the end of my life that shall give me the greatest blessing of it and confirm me  For ever Yours CHARLES GRANDISON  LETTER XXXIV  Signor  JERONYMO  della  PORRETTA  To Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  Inclosed in the preceding  Bologna  Oct  N S  I Gave you my dear Grandison in mine of the th the copy of a paper written by my sister which filled us with hopes of her compliance with the wishes of all her family She took time for deliberation time was given her but still she insisted on receiving your next Letters before she came to any resolution Mrs Beaumont herself was of opinion that the dear creature only meditated delay That also was ours What invincibly determined as she is to adhere to the resolution she has so greatly taken can she hope for said we among ourselves from the expected Letters For she had declared herself to be  so  determined to my brother Giacomo who actually assured her of all our consents to an alliance with you if she repented of that resolution  All this time we offered not to introduce nor even to name to her the Count of Belvedere Awed by her former calamity and by an excursiveness of imagination which at times shewed itself in her words and behaviour we avoided saying or doing anything that was likely to disturb her Giacomo himself tho' he wanted to return to Naples had patience with her pretty trifling beyond our expectation At last arrived yours of the th of September  See Letter v p  kindly inclosing a copy of yours to her of the same date  See Letter iv p  We question not but your reply to mine of the th current is on the road not that the contents will be such as we may hope for from considerations of our happiness and your own But these we thought  without waiting for that would answer the desired end I will tell you what was said by every one on the perusal of both  Is this the man said the General whom I sometimes so rudely treated I rejoice that we were reconciled before he left us I had formed a notion to his disadvantage that he was capable of art and hoped to keep his hold in my sister's affections in view of some turn in his favour But he is the most singlehearted of men These two Letters will strengthen our arguments Clementina who has more than once declared that she wishes him married to an English woman cannot now that she will see there is a woman with whom he thinks he can be happy wish to stand in his way These will furnish us with means to attack her in her strongest hold in her generosity her delicacy and will bring to the test her veracity The contents of these Letters will confirm her before halftaken resolution as in her paper to oblige us  See p of this Volume  Let  Laurana  as the Chevalier says go into a nunnery Clementina will marry or she is a false girl and the Sforza woman will be disappointed  My mother applauded you and rejoiced to hear that there is a woman of your own nation who is capable of making you more happy than her daughter could  What difficulties said the young Marchioness ever your friend must a situation so critical have laid him under A man so humane And what further difficulties must he have to surmunt in offering to a woman whom even Olivia as he says admires a hand that has been refused by another May this admired woman be propitious to his suit  She must she must said the Bishop If she has a heart disengaged she cannot refuse a man so accomplished Jeronymo hasten to be well If she favour him we will all go over and congratulate them both  I for my part said I would give up years of life to see my friend as happy in marriage as he deserves to be  We must tell Clementina said my father as our Giacomo has hinted that it will not become her generosity to stand in the way of the Chevalier's happiness  We sent up your Letter to our sister by Camilla She was busy Mrs Beaumont sitting by her at work in correcting the proportion which once you found fault with in a figure in her piece of Noah's Ark and the rising Deluge A Letter madam from the ChevalierTo me said she and overturned the table on which her materials lay in haste to take it  When we thought she had had time to consider of the contents we sent up to request the favour of speaking with Mrs Beaumont We owned to her that we had a copy of your Letter to Clementina and asked What the dear creature said to the contents of it  She read it answered Mrs Beaumont in her own closet I thought she was too long by herself I went to her She was in tears O Mrs Beaumont as soon as she saw me holding out the LetterSee hereThe  Chevalier  is against meCruel I could  almost  say cruel GrandisonHe turns my own words upon me I have furnished him with arguments against myselfWhat shall I doI have for many days past repented that I gave under my hand reason to my friends to expect my compliance I cannot cannot confirm the hopes I gaveWhat shall I do  I took it read it continued Mrs Beaumont and told her that the Chevalier's arguments were unanswerable I dwelt upon some of them She wept and was silent  We then my dear Grandison shewed Mrs Beaumont your Letter to me She read itHow said  she has this excellent young man been embarassed I know from some of my countrymen the character of the Lady whom he mentions She is an excellent womanMay I take up this Letter and read it to Lady Clementina  By all means answered the General and support dear madam the contents of both with your weight It will be from perverseness  now  if she withstand us Bid her remember that she has had once at her feet a kneeling father Bid her remember the written hopes she has given us  Mrs Beaumont went up with it I will give you an account of what my sister said as she read it O Grandison read it but cursorily You will more and more admire and love the Clementina who before her malady was always considered as one of the first of women and the glory of our house  She desired to have it in her own hands Mrs Beaumont to whose pen we owe the account looked over her and followed her eye as she read  See Letter v p of this Volume    'And did he still said she  after  he had got to England hope for a change in my resolution'  Heaven knowsShe stopt sighed and read on  'He foresaw that my friends would press me to marry'  I foresaw it tooI have indeed been pressed vehemently pressed  'Rather than any other'  Ah ChevalierWhy why were the obstacles Religion and Country None less should haveShe stoptThen reading to herself proceeded  'It was not presumptuous to hope'  No Grandison presumptuous it could not be  'It was  justice  to Clementina to attend the event and to wait for the promised Letter'  Kind considerate GrandisonYou were all patience all goodnessO thatThere she stopt Then proceeding  'Fourth brother Nor interested in the event'  Indeed I  did  write so  'Give up all his hopes'  Dear Grandison  'It could not be expected that he should give the argument all its weight'  He has given it too much  'Duty to yield to the entreaties of all my friends'  Ah Grandison  Difficult situationsDifficult indeed And here am I who have more than any other in the world enhanced his difficultiesUnhappy ClementinaThen reading on  Good God Mrs Beaumont  'There is an English Lady with whom he was  actually  Does he not hint in Love'  Nay thenTake it take it Mrs BeaumontI can read no further  Compassion  only I suppose brought him over to meI cannot bear thatYet snatching it from her and reading  'Beauty her least perfection'  Happy English Lady  'Either in my eyes or her own'  Have I not wished him such a woman  'Had I never  known  Clementina'  How could I be so captious  'Loves her with a flame as pure as the heart of Clementina'  Thank you Chevalier Indeed I have no impurity in my LoveMy God only have I preferred to you And I bless God for enabling me to give so  due  a preference  'or as her own heart can boast'  Just such a wife did I wish him and shall I not rejoice if such a one will hold out her hand to make him happy  She sighed often as she read on but spoke not till she came to the words  'That she was to you what you might truly call a first Love'  A first Love repeated she He was indeed mine Permit me to say my dear friends a first and  only  one  'It became him he says in honour in gratitude tho' the difficulties in his way seemed insuperable And so they  must  seem to hold himself in suspense and not offer to make his addresses to any other  woman'  Generous noble GrandisonHe  did  love meDiscouraged as he was nay insulted by some of us Giacomo hears me not looking round her  He  the generous Grandison  did  love me She wiped her eyes  Recovering herself and reading onSee here Mrs Beaumont  'He thought himself obliged in honour to me and to the persons themselves to decline proposals of advantage'  Surely he must think me an ingrateful creature  But reading on did he  'balance in his mind between this Lady and me'  He did But it was because of his uncertainty with  me  Reading to herself to the words  'Almost an  equal  interest'  How is that said she repeating themO it is explained  'But when his dear Clementina'  Do I go too fast for your eye Mrs Beaumont  'began to shew signs of recovery'  She sighed  'and seemed to confirm the hopes I had given him of my  partiallty  for him'  Modest good man  'then did I content myself'  says he Look Mrs Beaumont  'with wishing another husband to the English Lady more worthy of her than my unhappy situation could have made me'  Excellent English Lady If it were in my power I would make you amends for having shared a heart with you so it seems that ought  my  circumstances and  your  merit considered to have been all your own  'What a disappointment was my rejection of him'  See these are his wordsAnd these too that  'he admires me however for my  motives  '  'Marriage he says is not in his power for there is but one woman in the world now I have refused him that he can think worthy of succeeding  me  What honour he does me Thank God she is an English woman O that I had any influence over her Sweet Lady amiable Englishwoman let not punctilio  deprive you of such a man as thisShew her this Letter my good Grandison Let me transcribe from it  rather  for your perusal happy English Lady certain passages in it so delicate so worthy of himself and of you  'Thousands of whom he is not worthy'  he says How how can he say so  'She has for an admirer every one who knows her'  She shall have me for an admirer Mrs Beaumont if she will accept of my fourth brother She  will  accept of him if she deserves the character he gives her Let me tell you Lady that your heart is narrower than that of Clementina if you think it a diminution to your honour that he has loved that Clementina Why cannot you and I be sisters My love shall be but a sisterly love You may depend upon the honour of the Chevalier Grandison He will do  his  duty in every relation of life What can be your doubts  'Even Olivia he says admires you'  And will such a woman stand upon punctilious observances like women of ordinary consequence having to deal with common menO that I knew this Lady I would convince her that he  'can do justice to  her  greater and to  my  lesser merits and yet not appear to be divided by a double Love altho' he should own to all the world as he says he will'  See see Mrs Beaumont these are his very words  'his affection for Clementina and glory in it'  O Mrs Beaumont how my Soul putting her hand to her forehead then to her heart loves his Soul nor but for  one  obstacle that would have shaken my Faith and endangered my Salvation had I got over it should his Soul  only  have been the object of my Love  Let me but continue single my dear friends indulge me in the wish that has been so long next my heart and take not advantage of the hopes I have given  you in writing and I shall pass happily through this short life a life that deserves not the bustle which we make about it Ask me not either to  'set or follow the example you propose to me'  I cannot cannot do either Unkind Chevalier why why would you strengthen  their  hands and weaken  mine  Yet if it became your justice what had I  but  justice to expect from a just man who has so eminently performed all his own duties and particularly the filial which he here calls an article of Religion  When she came to the concluding part of this Letter and your wishes for her perfect recovery health and welfare and for the happiness of us all May every blessing said she he wishes us be his  Then folding up the Letter and putting it in her bosom This Letter and that which accompanied it meaning yours to her I must read over and over  Shall I say my Grandison that I halfpity the lovely Harriet Byron tho' her name should be changed to yours You  must  love Clementina Were a sovereign Princess her rival you  must  Clementina who so generously can give up a Love as fervent as ever glowed in a virgin heart on superior motives motives which regard Eternity and receive joy in the prospect of your happiness with another woman on a persuasion that that woman can make you happier than she herself could because of a difference in Religion  My sister choosing to retire to her closet to reperuse the two Letters Mrs Beaumont knowing our curiosity put down what had passed intending as she said to write a copy of it for you  How were we all on perusing it charmed with our ClementinaI insisted that nothing at present should be said to her of the Count of Belvedere and of our wishes in his favour My father gave into my opinion He said he thought the properest time to  mention the Count to her was when we had an answer to the Letter I wrote to you on the th current if that could give us assurances that you had made your addresses to the charming Byron and were encouraged The General was impatient but he acquiesced on finding every one come into my motion but said that if all this lenity did not do he must beg leave to have his own measures pursued  SOME little particularity has appeared in the dear creature since I have written the above She has been exceedingly earnest with her mother to use her interest with my father and us to be allowed to go to England But desires not the permission till you are actually married She pleads my health because of the salutary springs you mention to me  Several other pleas she offered but to say truth they carried with them such an air of flightiness that I am loth to mention them Yet all of them were innocent all of them were even laudable But shall I say that some of them appeared too romantic for a settled brain to be so earnest as she was in having them carried into execution  We have no doubt but all her view is to avoid marriage by such a strange excursion Dear creature said the Bishop speaking of her just now the veil denied her she must have  some  point to carry I wish we saw less rapidity in her manner  I Grandison for my part remember how much she and we all suffered by denying her the farewelvisit from you on your taking leave of Italy the time before the last  But we think an expedient has offered that will divert her from this  wildness  as I must call it Mrs Beaumont has requested that she may be allowed to take her with her to Florence for some weeks Clementina is pleased with our readiness to oblige them both and they will soon go  But all this time she is uniform and steady in her wishes for your marriage She delights to hear Mrs Beaumont talk of the perfections of the Lady to whom we are all desirous of hearing you are united You had written it seems to Mrs Beaumont a character given of this young Lady by Olivia upon a personal knowlege of her Mrs Beaumont shewed it to Clementina  How generously did the dear creature rejoice in it Just such a woman said she did I wish for the Chevalier Olivia has shewn greatness of mind in this instance Perhaps I have thought too hardly of Olivia Little did I think I should ever have requested a copy of anything written by Olivia Illwill disables us from seeing those beauties in the person who is the object of it which would otherwise strike us to her advantage You must oblige me added she with a copy of this Extract  Oct  N S  YOU will be pleased I know my Grandison with every particular that shall tend to demonstrate the pleasure the dear Clementina takes in hoping you will be soon the happy man we all wish you to be  This morning she came down with her work into my chamber I invite myself Jeronymo said she I will sit down by you till you are disposed to rise She then of her own motion began to talk of you and I putting it to her as her mother did yesterday whether she would be really glad to hear of your nuptials received the same answer she then made  She sincerely should  She hoped the next Letters would bring an account that it was so But then Jeronymo continued she I shall be teazed persecuted Let me not my brother be persecuted I don't know whether downright compulsion is not more tolerable than overearnest entreaty A child in the first instance may contract herself as I may say within her own compass may be hardened But the entreaty of such  friends as undoubtedly mean one's good dilates and disarms one's heart and makes one wish to oblige them and so renders one miserable whether we do or do not comply Believe me Jeronymo there is great cruelty in persuasion and still more to a soft and gentle temper than to a stubborn one Persuaders know not what they make such a person suffer  My dearest Clementina said I you have shewn so glorious a magnanimity that it would be injuring you to suppose you are not equal to every branch of  duty  God forbid that you should be called to sustain an unreasonable trialIn a reasonable one you must be victorious  Ah Jeronymo How little do I deserve this fine complimentMagnanimity my brotherYou know not what I yet at times sufferAnd have you not seen my reason vanquished in the unequal conflict She wept But let the Chevalier be married and to the Angel that is talked of and let me confort myself that he is not a sufferer by my withholding my handAnd  then  let me be indulged in the single life in a place consecrated to retirement from this vain world and we shall  both  be happy  Mrs Beaumont came to seek her I prevailed on her to sit down and on my sister to stay a little longer I extolled my sister to her She joined in the just praise But one act of magnanimity said Mrs Beaumont seems wanting to complete the greatness of your character my Love in this particular case of the expected marriage of the Chevalier Grandison  What is that Mrs BeaumontAll attention  You see his doubts his apprehensions of appearing worthy of the Lady so highly spoken of because of that delicacy of situation which as you observe Olivia also hints at from what may be called a divided Love Miss Byron may very well imagine as his  Love of you commenced before he knew her that she may injure you if she receive his addresses You had the generosity to wish when you were reading those his apprehensions that you  knew  the Lady and were able to influence her in his favour  Well Mrs Beaumont  Can I doubt that Lady Clementina is  able  to set her name to the noble sentiments that so lately on reading his Letter flowed from her lips  What would Mrs Beaumont have me do  Let me lead you to your own closet Pen ink and paper are always before you there Assume your whole noble Self and we shall see what that assumption will produce  All that is in my power to do replied she for promoting the happiness of a man who has suffered so much through my means it is my duty to do  She gave her hand to Mrs Beaumont who led her to her closet and left her there The following is the result Generous noble creatureBut does it not shew a raised imagination especially in the disposition of the lines  Best of Men  Be ye ONE  Best of Women  CLEMENTINA wishes it  GRANDISON Lady will make  you  happy  Be it  your  study to make  Him  so  Happy as CLEMENTINA would have made him  Had not obstacles invincible intervened  This will lessen her regrets  For  His Felicity Temporal and Eternal  Was ever the wish next her heart  GOD be merciful to you both  And lead you into his paths  Then will everlasting Happiness be your portion  Be it the portion of CLEMENTINA  Pray for Her  That after this transitory life is over  She may partake of Heavenly Bliss  And  Not a stranger to you Lady HERE  Rejoice with you both HEREAFTER  CLEMENTINA della PORRETTA  The admirable creature gave this to Mrs Beaumont Send this madam said she if you think proper to your friend and my friend the Chevalier Grandison Tell him that I shall think myself very happy if it may serve as a testimonial to the Lady whose merits intitle her to his Love of my sincere wishes for their mutual happiness Tell him that at present I wish for nothing more ardently than to hear of his Nuptials being celebrated  Dear Grandison let your next give us an opportunity to felicitate you on this desirable event In this wish joins every one of a family to whom you are and ever will be dear Witness for them all  The Marquis and Marchioness della PORRETTA  I T R Bishop of Nocera  JERONYMO della PORRETTA  J P M MARESCOTTI  HORTENSIA BEAUMONT  LETTER XXXV  Miss  BYRON  To Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  Wednesday Nov    HOW Sir have the contents of your friend Jeronymo's Letter affected meI am more and more convinced that however distinguished my lot  may  be Clementina only can deserve you What a vain creature must I be if I did  not  think so And  what a disingenuous one so thinking if I did not acknowlege it  I cannot Sir misconstrue your delicate sensibilities My own teach me to allow for yours  'Best of men' I can I do with Clementina think you But Harriet's ambition will be gratified in being accounted second to HER  And  does  Clementina  'wish us ONE'  Most noble most generous of women  'Grandison you say will make me happy'  But ah my lovely pattern  can  Harriet he happy even with her Grandison if  you  are not so  Believe me LADY  your  happiness will be essential to  hers  God give YOU happiness  Harriet prays for it  My nextto Divine Monitress it  shall  be my study to make Him happy  But most excellent of women  have  you  regrets  Regrets which can only be lessened by the joy you will have in his happinessAnd with another  Superlative goodness  Why why when he would allow to you the exercise of your Religion and only insists on the like liberty are the obstacles you hint at  invincible  O Sir I can pursue this subject no further Thus far an irresistable impulse carried me  How should I be able to stand before this Lady were the visit she was so earnest to be allowed to make to England to take place yet in such a case with what pleasure should I pay my reverence to her  mind  in her  person  And does SHE do her  family  do YOU Sir wish us  speedily  ONEAre you not▪ satisfied with the given monthIs not a month Sir  your declaration so lately made  a short term And let me ask you but within parentheses Do you not on an occasion so  very  delicate in your limited  three  days after your return to us treat the notinsensible Harriet a little more  Help me Sir to a wordthan might have been expected from a man so  very  politeAnd can you so generously yet so serously ask me From  which  parts of the Nuptial Life the LAST What a dreadful idea do you raise in that solemn word or the FIRST I would deduct the week's or fortnight's supposed delayO Sir what a way of putting it is thisThus I answer  'From  neither  '  My honour is your honour Determine YOU most generous of men for  Your  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XXXVI  Miss  JERVOIS  To Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  Tuesday Oct    Honoured Sir  YOU will think your ward very bold to address you by Letter especially as she is a very poor inditer and as you are in town But her heart is in trouble and she must write and must beg the favour of you the most indulgent guardian that ever poor Orphan had to answer her by pen and ink For whether you can forgive her or not she will be equally incapable of bearing your goodness or your displeasure▪ How weakly I express myself I find I shall write worse to you than to anybody else And why Because I wish to write best But I have great awe and no genius I am a poor girl in  every  sense as you shall hear byandby I hope you won't be  very  angry with me If you are I shall be worse than poorI shall be miserable  But to come before my guardian as a delinquent when I have ambition enough to wish to shine in his eyes if so it could have beenIt is a very great mortification indeedIf you were to acquit me I shall have had great punishment in that thought  But to open my troubled heart to youYet how shall I I thought to tell it you yesterday but for my  life I could not Did you not observe me once Sir hanging upon the back of your chair unable to stand in your sight O how I felt my face glow  Then  it  was  I thought to have spoken my mind but you were so kind so good to me I could not might I have had the world You took my handI shall be very bold to repeat it but am always so proud of your kind notice that I can't help it And you said drawing me gently to you  'Why keeps my Emily behind me What can I do for my Emily Tell me child Is there anything I can do for my ward'  Yet tho' the occasion was so fair I could not tell you But I shall tire you before I came to the point to the fault I should say that has emboldened me to write  This then is the truth of the matter  My poor mother Sir is very good now you know You have taken from her all her cares about this world She and her husband live together happily and elegantly They want for nothing and are grown quite religious So that they have leisure to think of their Souls good They make me cry for joy whenever I go to them They pray for you and heap blessings upon you and cry to think they ever offended you  But Sir I took it into my head knowing it was a vast way for them to go from Soho to somewhere in Moorfields to hear the preacher they admire so much and coachhire and charities and  contributions  of one kind or other for their minister has no establishment and old debts paying off that at present tho' I believe they are frugal enough they can't be much aforehandSo thought I shall I ride in my guardian's coach at one time in Lady G's at another in Lady L's at another tho' so much better able to walk than my poor mother while she is growing into years and when infirmities are coming on and my guardian's example before me so opening to one's heartI ventured therefore unknown to my mother and  her husband unknown to anybody by way of surprize to bespeak a plain neat chariot and agreed for a coachman and a pair of horses for I had about guineas by me when I bespoke it Out of this thought I which is my own money without account I shall be able to spare enough for the first halfyear's expences after which they will be in circumstances to keep it on And as quarters come round thought I I will stint myself and throw in something towards it and then my poor mother and her husband can go to serve God and take sometimes an airing or so where they please and make an appearance in the world as the mother of the girl who is intitled to so large a fortune And I don't grudge Mr OHara for he is vastly tender of my mother now Which must be a great comfort to her you know Sir now she is come to be sorry for past things and apt to be very spiritless when she looks backPoor dear woman  But here Sir was the thing Believing it became me as Lady L Lady G and Mrs Eleanor Grandison intended to shew their respect to you on a certain happy occasion by new cloaths to shew mine the same way I went to the mercer's and was so tempted by two patterns that not knowing which to choose I bought of both not thinking at the time of the bespoken chariot To be sure I ought to have consulted Lady L or Lady G but foolish creature as I was I must be for surprising them too with my fine fancy  Then I laid out a good deal more than I intended in milanery matters Not but I had my pennyworths for my penny But the milaners are so very obliging they shew one this pretty thing and that fashionable one and are so apt to praise one's taste and one is so willing to believe them and to be thought mighty clever that there is no resisting the vanity they raise I own all my folly I ever will Sir when I am guilty  of any greater silliness than ordinary for I have no bad heart I hope tho' I am one of the flowers I once heard you compare some of us to who are late before they blow into discretion  But now good Sir came on my distress For the bespoken chariot was ready ready sooner by a fortnight than I expected I thought my quarter would be nearer ended and I had made a vast hole in my money I pulled up a courage I had need of it and borrowed fifty guineas of Lady G but from this foolish love of surprizes cared not to tell her for what And having occasion to pay two or three bills I was a thoughtless creature to be sure which unluckily tho' I had asked for them before were brought in just then I borrowed another sum but  yet  told not Lady G for what and the dear Lady I believe thought me an extravagant girl I saw she did by her looks  But however I caused the new chariot to be brought privately to me I went in it and it carried me to Soho and there on my knees made my present to my mother  But do you think Sir that she and Mr OHara when I confessed that I had not consulted you upon it and that neither Lady L nor Lady G nor yet Mrs Eleanor Grandison knew a syllable of the matter would accept of it They would not But yet they both cried over me for joy and blessed me  It is put up somewhere And there it lies till I have obtained your pardon first and your direction afterwards And what shall I do if you are angry at your por ward who has done so inconsiderate a thing and run herself into debt  Chide me honoured Sir if you please Indeed you never  yet  did chide me But yours will be chideings of Love of  paternal  Love Sir  But if you are angry with me more than a day if you give me reason to believe you think meanly of me  tho' alas I may deserve it and that this rashness is but a prelude to other rash or conceited steps for that is the fear which most terrifies me and is therefore to be resented with severity then will I fly to my dear Miss Byron that now isAnd if she cannot soften your displeasure and restore me to your  good opinion  Mere pardon will not be enough for your trulypenitent ward then will I say Burst heart Ingrateful inconsiderate Emily Thou hast offended thy Guardian What is there left in this life that is worth thy cares  And now Sir I have laid my troubled heart open before you I know you will not so much blame the thing even should you not approve of it as the manner doing it after you had been so extremely generous and inconsiderate to my mother without consulting either you or your sisters O my vanity and conceit They they have misled me They never shall again whether you forgive me or not  But good indulgent honoured Sir my Guardian my Protector let not my punishment be the reversing of the gracious grant which my heart has been so long wishing to obtain and which you had consented to of being allowed to live immediately in your own eye and in the presence of my dear Miss Byron that now is This rash action should rather induce you to confirm than reverse it And I promise to be very good I ever loved her I shall add filial honour as I may say to my love of her I never will do anything without consulting her and but what you the kindest Guardian that ever poor Orphan had would wish me to do  And now Sir honour me with a few lines from your own hand were it but to shew me that this impertinence has not so far tired you as should you think it just to banish me from your presence for  some time  to make you discourage applications to you by pen and ink from Sir  Your truly sorrowful Ward and everobliged and grateful EMILY JERVOIS  LETTER XXXVII  Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  To Miss  JERVOIS  Wedn Nov    I Write to the dear child of my tenderest cares because she requests me to write Else I had hastened to her in person to comfort her doubting heart and to assure her that nothing but a fault premeditated and persisted in that might have affected her present or future reputation and consequently her happiness could make me for half an hour offended with her Your good intentions my dear child will ever be your security with me Men as well as women are often misled by their love of surprizes But the greatest surprize my Emily could give me would be if she could do any  one  thing that would shew a faulty heart  Once more my dear pay your duty to your mother in the chariot which has been the causless occasion of so much concern to you and tell her and Mr OHara that they have greatly obliged me in declining the acceptance of the chariot so dutifully presented till they knew my mind But that not so much in the compliment paid to me as your  guardian  as because it has given me an opinion of their own generosity and discretion Tell them that I greatly approve of this instance of your duty to your mother and of your regard for her sake to Mr OHara Tell them that I join with my everamiable ward in requesting their acceptance of it and do you  my dear tell Miss Jervois that I greatly honour her for this new instance of her goodness of heart  I inclose a note and will to make you easy carry it to its proper account that will enable you to pay the debt which you with so dutiful an intention have contractedForgive you my dear I love I admire you for it I will not have you  stint  yourself as you call it in order to contribute to the future expence of the chariot The present is but a handsome one respecting your fortune Be therefore for your mother's life the whole expence yours and it may possibly contribute not a little to the ease of mind of both as they now live together not unhappily if you have the goodness to assure Mr OHara that you are so well satisfied with his kind treatment of your mother that you will on supposition of the continuance of it before you enter into engagements which may limit your own power or make your will dependent on that of another person secure a handsome provision for him for his life in case he survive your mother  I thank you my dearest ward for the affection you express for my beloved Miss Byron She loves you so tenderly that it would have been a concern to me had she  not  engaged your love and confidence You highly oblige me by promising to consult her on all material occasions The benefit  you  will receive from her prudent advice and example and the delight  she  will receive from your company will be a happiness to all three My Emily may depend upon everything to make it completely so that shall be in the power of  Her faithful Friend and humble Servant CHARLES GRANDISON  LETTER XXXVIII  Miss  JERVOIS  To Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  Thursday Nov    A Few lines Sir a very fewNot to shew my vanity my pride in being allowed to write to my Guardian nor to presume to draw him into an intercourse of Letters No Sir I write only to thank you which I do a thousand thousand times for the ease the joy you have given to my heart O how I dreaded to open your Letter But I could not have expected it to be so  very  indulgent to a faulty girl Not  one  rebuke O Sir how  very  good you are And to send me the money to clear my debts To bid me make my present In so  gracious  a manner to bid me And to put me upon promising a provision for life for Mr OHara if he survive my mother which will not oblige them to live a narrower life while they are together in order to save in view of such an unhappy eventI flew to them with the good newsI read the whole Letter to them O how their hearts blessed you at their eyes for they could not presently speak and how my tears mingled with theirs O Sir you made us all infantsI for my part am still a babyDid I ever cry so much for grief as you have made me cry for joyIt is well something nowandthen comes to check one's joy there would be no bearing it else But I shall encroach on your precious time Thank you thank you Sir a hundred thousand times My mother is happy Mr OHara is happy My Miss Byron will soon be the happiest of all human beings thank GodYou my Guardian must be one of the happiest of men May everybody else be happy that you wish to be so And then how happy will be good Sir  Your dutiful Ward and obliged Servant ever to be commanded EMILY JERVOIS  They say you set out for Northamptonshire next  Monday  or  Tuesday  at furthest Lord bless meLord bless you I would sayAnd bless everybody you loveAmenfor ever and ever  LETTER XXXIX  Miss  BYRON  To Lady  G  Thursday Nov    I Have laid before you my dear Lady G your brother's and Signor Jeronymo's Letters as also my answer to your brother's My spirits never were so unequal All joy at one time apprehension at another that something will still happenGreville is reported to be so gloomy so silent He hates me he saysAnd here unexpectedly is poor Mr Orme returned Amended in his health a little those who have seen him say and he thinks soI am glad of it And here are we sitting in judgment my aunt Ladypresident on the patterns you have sent My uncle too will have his opinion be takenAnd Mr Deane who threatened he would not come to Selbyhouse till the Settlements were to be signed or read I cannot tell whatwill be here on Saturday  MR Orme has desired leave to visit me tomorrow My uncle so hurries my spirit not with his raillery as he used to dobut with his joy He talks of nothing but the coming down of your brother and the limited three days after and numbers the days nay the hours as they fly For he supposes Sir Charles will be here on Monday at furthest and calls that a delay of particular grace and favour For has he not said says he that nothing after Friday can on his part detain him from us  But Lady G will he not write before he comes to my last Say my uncle what he pleases your  brother can't be down before Saturday se'nnight at soonest  Your fancy and Lady L's determine us My aunt has undertaken this province She therefore will write to you what she thinks fit Is there not too much glare in the flowered silver as you describe it Don't my dear let me be a bride in a masquerade habit Humility becomes persons of some degree We want not glare We are  known  to be able to afford rich dresses need them not therefore to give us consequence Simplicity only can be elegance Let me not be gaudy Let not fancy or art or study be seen in my dresses Something must be done I grant on our  appearance  for an an appearance we must not dispense with here in the country whatever you women of quality may do in town But let me not I beseech you or as little as possible be marked out for a  lustre  and be so good as to throw in a hint to this purpose to the dear busy girls here as from yourselves for they are exercising their fancies as if I were to be a Queen of the May Your authorities will support me if they give me cause to differ in opinion from them  MISS Orme has just been with me She confirms her brother's amendment She is sorry that his impatience has brought him over when the climate was so favourable to him She says I shall find him sincerely disposed to congratulate me on my happy prospect of which she has given him ample particulars He could not she says but express himself pleased that neither Fenwick nor Greville but that one of so superior a character is to be the man  What greater felicity can a young creature propose to herself in the days of courtship than to find every one in her family and out of it applauding her choice Could I a few weeks ago have thoughtBut hushed be vanity Pride withdraw Meekeyed  Humility stand forthAm I indeed to be the happiest of women Will nothing happenO no no Heaven will protect your brotherYet this Greville is a trouble to me Not because of my horrid dream I am not so superstitious as to let that disturb me But from a hint he gave Miss Orme  She met him this morning at a neighbouring Lady's He thus accosted her I understand madam that your brother is returned He is a happy man Just in time to see Miss Byron married Fenwick a dog is gone to howl at Carlisle on the occasion Your brother and I have nothing to do but howl in recitative to each other here  My brother Mr Greville said Miss Orme I am sure will behave like a man on the occasion Nor can you have reason to howl as you call it Sir Charles Grandison is  your  particular friend you know  True Miss Orme affecting to laugh off this hit I thought I could have braved it out but now the matter comes near it sticks here just here pointing to his throat I cannot get it through my gizzard Plaguy hard of digestion making faces in his light way  But will your brother proceeded he be contented to stay within the noise of the bells which will in a few days perhaps be set a ringing for ten m  les round Sir Charles drives on at a dnable rate I hear  'But he must let me die decently I can tell him We will not part for ever with the flower of our county without conditions'  Shall  you  see the Siren madam If you do tell her that I have no chance for peace but in hating her heartily But whispering Miss Orme bid her NOT TO BE TOO SECURE  I was strangely struck with these words for my spirits were not high before I repeated them I dwelt upon them and weptFool that I was But  I soon recollected myself and desired Miss Orme not to take notice of my tender folly  Friday  I HAVE had a visit from Mr Orme He has given  me  some pleasure I added not to  his  melancholy He asked me several interesting questions which I would not have answered any other man as I told him I shall always value Mr Orme Your brother is the most generous of men But were he not so very generous he ought to allow for my  civility  to this worthy man since I can applaud  him  with my whole heart for  loving  the noble Clementina What a narrowhearted creature must I be if I did not But as a woman's honour is of a more delicate nature I believe than a man's with regard to  personal  love so perhaps if this be allowed me a man may be as jealous of a woman's  civility  in general cases I mean as a woman may be of a man's  Love  to another object This may sound strange at first hearing Lady G but I know what I mean Nobody else does Harriet perhaps you will say But they would I reply if I were to explain myself which at present if you apprehend me not I have no inclination to do  How did this worthy man praise Sir Charles Grandison He must see that my pride no not pride my gratitude was raised by it as well to the  praiser  as  praised  He concluded with a blessing on us both which he uttered in a different manner from what that BalaamGreville uttered his It was followed with tears good man and he left me almost unable to speak How grateful in our ears are the praises bestowed on those whom we fondly love  Lucy thinks I had best go to my grandmamma's before he comes down and that he should visit me there from Selbyhouse Neither my aunt nor I am of this opinion but that he should himself go to Shirleymanor and visit us from thence For is not Selbyhouse my usual place of residence My grandmamma  will be delighted with his company and conversation But as he cannot think of coming down before the latter end of next week at the soonest it is time enough to consider of these things Yet can a young creature the awful solemnity so near and with a man whom she prefers to all others find room in her head for any other topic  I have a Letter from my good Mrs Reeves She and my cousin are so full of this happy subject that they invite themselves down to us and hope we will excuse them for their earnestness on this occasion They are prodigiously earnest I wonder my cousin can think of leaving her little boy My aunt says there is no denying them How soSurely one may excuse one's self to friends one so dearly loves Your presence my Charlotte I own would be a high satisfaction to me Yet you would be a little unmanageable I doubt There can be no hope of Lady L's But if there were neither she nor anybody else could keep you orderlyPoor dear EmilyMy aunt wishes that we  could  have had her with us But for her own sake it must not be How often do I revolve that reflexion of your brother's that in our happiest prospects the sighing heart will confess imperfection But I will not add another word after I have assured you my dearest Ladies that I am and ever will be  Your grateful and most affectionate humble Servant HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XL  Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  To Miss  BYRON  Friday Nov    REceive dearest loveliest of women the thanks of a most grateful heart for your invaluable favour of Wednesday last Does my  Harriet  Already  methinks I have sunk the name of Byron into that of Grandison do Mrs Shirley Mrs Selby think that I have treated one of the most delicate of Female minds indelicately in the  wish  not the  prescription  I have presumed to signify to the beloved of my heart that within three days after my  permitted  return to Northamptonshire I may be allowed to receive at the Altar the greatest blessing of my life I

with your will Permit me to say that the family punctilio was not out of my thoughts when I expressed my own ardent wishes to you Does not the world about you expect on the return of the happy man a speedy solemnization I imagined that whether he be permitted to make the place of his abode Selbyhouse or Shirleymanor you would not that the happy day should be long deferred which should give him rank as one of the dear family  Our Equipages my dearest life are all in great forwardness In tenderness to you I have forborne to consult you upon some parts of them as my regard for your judgment would othewise have obliged me to do The Settlements are all ready Our good Mr Deane is ready to attend you with them Allow me then to do myself the honour of presenting myself before you at

give you fair notice of it that you may either check or encourage her as you think fit  Have I not cause to think your brother a little out of the way in his resolution of so sudden a returnThis night

of men Sir Charles Grandison I mean informs you that his life is in great danger He over heard Mr Greville say in a rageful manner as by his voice  'I never will allow such a prize to be carried from me He shall die the death'  and swore to it He was a little in wine it is true and I should have disregarded it for that reason had I not informed myself that he is set out with armed men this morning Make what use you please of this You never will know the writer But love and reverence to the young Baronet is all my motive So help me God  Two of my uncle's tenants severally saw the shocking creature on the London road with servants What will become of me before morning if he arrives not this night in safety  Monday Night Eleven  MY uncle dispatched two servants to proceed on the London

Afraid to come down I suppose for fear of seeing each other My eyes are swelled out of my headI wonder my uncle is not down  He  might give orders about somethingI know not what What dreadful visions had I ready as it seemed to continue my disturbance could I have closed my eyes to give seeming form to the flying shadows Waking dreams For I was broad awake Sally sat up with me Such startings such absencesI never was so before Such another night would I not have for the world I can only write Yet  what  do I write To what purposeYou must not see what I have written Now on my knees praying vowing Now  O my Lucy  LUCY entered just hereNancy followed herNancy tormented me with her resveries of the past night My aunt is not well she has not slept My uncle fell into a dose about his usual risingtime He has had no rest My grandmamma must not know  the occasion of our grief till it cannot be kept from her  If  But no moreDreadful  If    LETTER XLII  Miss  BYRON  In continuation  Tuesday    o'Clock Nov    In a small hand under the Superscription of the inner Cover  My dearest Lady G pray read the first page of this Letter before you open the other dreadful one sealed with five seals and stitched to the Cover that it may not slide  officiously  into your hands Lucy will have me send the whole of that shocking Letter Against my judgment I comply  WE met this morning soulless and forlorn all equally unable either to give or receive consolation The officious note was taken up laid down taken up again the hand endeavoured to be guessed at And at last it was concluded to dispatch a servant to Mr Greville's to learn news of the supposed traitor  But behold before the servant could return in a ridingdress having alighted at the outward gate entered the hall your noble brother I was the first whom he saw the first who saw him I was just going out intending yet hardly knowing my intention to walk in the Elmrow fronting the house in order to shorten the way of the returning servant with news  He cast himself at my feet Something he said and more he intended to say excusing his early return and thanking me for my favour of the Wednesday before when my joyful surprize overpowered both my speech and sensesAnd what will you say to me when I tell you that on my recovery I found myself in his arms mine clasped about his neck  He was surprised at my emotion Well he mightEvery one in a moment crouded about himMy  aunt also folded her arms around himWelcome welcome welcome was all she could at the instant say  I utterly abasned trembling and doubting my feet motioned to quit the hall for the parlourBut nobody minded me all were busied in congratulating the joy of every heart till Sally presenting herself I leaned upon her and staggering to the parlour threw myself into an elbowchair  Your brother attended by all my friends followed me in My heart again bid him welcome tho' my eye could not at that instant bear his He took my hand as I sat between both his and in the most respectful manner pressing it with his lips besought me to compose myself  They had hinted to him in the hall the cause of all our emotionsThey had as much reason to blush as I hadNancy it seems even Nancy snatched his hand and kissed it in raptures How dear is he to us all He sees it now There can be no reserves to him after this Punctilio  Family Punctilio  mentioned he in his LetterWe have now no pretensions to it  His eyes shone with grateful sensibility Look down upon me loveliest of women said he with a bent knee Look down upon me and tell me you forgive me for my early return But tho' returned I am entirely at your devotion  Lucy says she never saw me more to my advantage I looked down upon him as he bid me smiling through my tears He stole gently my handkerchief from my halfhid face with it he dried my unaverted cheek and put it she says in his bosom I have lost it  My uncle and aunt withdrew with him and acquainted him with all particulars To them he acknowleged in words of eloquent Love my uncle said the honour done him by me and by us all in the  demonstrations we had given of our tender regard for him  I was by the time of their return to us pretty well recovered Sir Charles approached me without takeing notice of the emotion I had been in Mr and Mrs Selby tell me said he to me that I am to be favoured with a residence at our venerable Mrs Shirley's This tho' a high honour looks a little distant so would the next door if it were not under the same roof with my Miss Byron But smiling tenderly upon me I shall presume to hope that this very distance will turn to my account Mrs Shirley's Harriet cannot decline paying her accustomed duty to the best of grandmothers  Bowing I shall not Sir said I be the more backward to pay my duty to my grandmamma for your obliging her with your company  Thus resumed he snatching my hand and ardently pressing it with his lips do I honour to myself for the honour done me How poor is man that he cannot express his gratitude to the object of his vows for obligations conferred but by owning to her new obligation  Then turning round to my auntIt is incumbent upon me madam said he to pay my early devoirs to Mrs Shirley the  hospitable  Mrs Shirley repeated he smiling which looked as if he expected to be here  There  besides looking pleasantly upon my aunt I may be asked  here  I am notto break my fast  This set us all into motion My uncle ran out to look after Sir Charles's servants who it seems in our hurry were disregarded Their horses in the courtyard three of them walking about waiting their master's orders My uncle was ready in the true taste of old English hospitality to  pull  them in  Chocolate was instantly brought for their master and a dish for each of us We had made but a poor  breakfast any of us I could get nothing down before My aunt put a second dish into my hand I took her kind meaning and presented it to Sir Charles How gratefully did he receive it Wiil it  always  be so Lady G My love heightened by my duty shall not when the obligation is doubled make me less deserving of his politeness if I can help it  But still this dreadful note and Greville's reported moodiness made us uneasy The servant we sent returned with information that Mr Greville came home late last night He was not stirring it seems tho' Eleven o'Clock when the servant reached his house He is said to be not well and as one servant of his told ours so very fretful and illtempered that they none of them know how to speak to him God grantBut let me keep to myself such of my apprehensions as are founded on conjectureWhy should I not hope the best Is not your beloved brother at present safe And is he not the care of ProvidenceI humbly trust he is  Sir Charles took the note I think I have seen the hand said he If I have I shall find out the writer I dare say it is written with a good intention  My uncle and we all expressed some in words some by looks our apprehensions  There cannot possibly be room for any said Sir Charles always present to himself Mr Greville loves Miss Byron It is no wonder as his apprehensions of losing all hopes of her for ever grow stronger that he should be uneasy He would make but an ill compliment to her merit and his own sincerity if he were not But such a stake as he has in his country he cannot have desperate intentions I remember to his advantage his last behavour here I will make him a visit I must engage Mr Greville to rank me in the number of his friends  What he said gave us comfort No wonder if we women love courage in a man We  ought  if it be true  courage like that of your excellent brother After all my dear I think we must allow a natural superiority in the minds of men over women Do we not want protection And does not that want imply inferiorityYet if there be two sorts of courage an  acquired  and a  natural  why may not the former be obtained by women as well as by men were they to have the same education NATURAL courage may belong to either Had Miss Barnevelt for example had a boy's education she would have probably challenged her man on provocation given and he might have come off but poorly  But we have more silly antipathies than men which help to keep us down Whether those may not sometimes be owing to affectation do you Lady G who however have as little affectation as ever woman had determine A frog a toad a spider a beetle an earwig will give us mighty pretty tender terror while the heroic men will trample the insect under foot and look the more brave for their barbarity and for our  delicate  screaming But for an  adventure  if a Lover get us into one we frequently leave him a great way behind us Don't you think so Lady GWere not this Greville still in my head methinks I could be as pert as ever  Sir Charles told us that he should have been with us last night but for a visit he was obliged to pay to Sir Harry Beauchamp to make up for which hindrance he took horse and ordered his equipage to follow him  He is gone to pay his duty as he is pleased to call it to my grandmamma in my uncle's coach my uncle with him If they cannot prevail on my grandmamma to come hither to dinner and if she is desirous Sir Charles should dine with her he will oblige her  by my aunt's leave  was his address to her But perhaps she will have the goodness to add her company to his as she knows  that  will give us all double pleasure  She loves to give pleasure Often does the dear Lady say  'How can palsied age which is but a terrifying object to youth expect the indulgence the love of the young and gay if it does not study to promote those pleasures which itself was fond of in youth Enjoy innocently your season girls once said she setting half a score of us into country dances I watch for the failure of my memory and shall never give it over for quite lost till I forget what were my own innocent wishes and delights in the days of my youth'  Tuesday Five o'Clock  MY uncle and Sir Charles came back to dinner my grandmamma with them She was so good as to give me her company at the first word Sir Charles as we sat at dinner and afterwards saw me weak in mind bashful and not quite recovered and he seemed to watch my uncle's eyes and so much diverted him and all of us that my uncle had not opportunity to put forth as usual How did this kind protection assure me I thought myself quite well and was so chearfully silent when Sir Charles talked that my grandmamma and aunt who had placed me between them whispered me severallyYou look charmingly easy loveYou look like yourself my dear Yet still this mischievous Greville ran in my head  My uncle took notice that Sir Charles had said he guessed at the writer of the note He wished he would give him an  item  as he called it whom he thought of  You observe Sir answered Sir Charles that the writer says Mr Greville was in wine He professes to be an encourager of the people of the George in Northampton He often appoints company to meet him there I imagine the writer to be the head waiter of the house The bills delivered me in seem to have been writen in such a hand as the note as far as I can carry the hand writing in my eye  Adsheart said my uncle that's undoubtedly right Your name's up Sir I can tell you among men women and children This man in his note calls you Look else the most generous and noble of men He says we  shall never know the writer  Adsdines the man must deal in art magic that conceals himself from you if you have a mind to find him out  Well but said Lucy if this be so I am concerned for the reality of the information Such threatenings as Mr Greville throws out are not to be slighted Very true said my uncle Mr Deane and I Mr Deane will certainly be here byandby will go and discourse with Greville himself tomorrow please the Lord  Sir Charles begged that this matter might be left to his management Mr Greville and I said he are upon such a foot as whether he be so sincerely my friend as I am his or not will warrant a visit to him and he cannot but take it as a civility on my return into these parts  Should he be affronting Sir Charles Said my uncle  I can have patience if he should He cannot be grosly so  I know not  that  replied my uncle Mr Greville is a  roister  Well dear Mr Selby leave this matter to me  Were  there to be danger the way to avoid it is not to appear to be afraid of it One man's fear gives another courage I have no manner of doubt of being able to bring Mr Greville with me to an amicable dish of tea or to dinner which you please tomorrow  Adsheart Sir I wish not to see at  either  the wretch who could threaten the life of a man so dear to us all  Sir Charles bowed to my uncle for his sincere compliment I have nothing to do said he but to invite myself either to breakfast or dine with  him  His  former scheme of appearing to the world well with me in order to save his spirit will be resumed and all will be right  My aunt expressed her fears however and looked at me as I did at her with a countenance I suppose far from being unapprehensive But Sir Charles said You must leave me my dear friends to my own methods nor be anxious for my safty I am not a rash man I can pity Mr Greville and the man I pity cannot easily provoke me  We were all the easier for what the charminglycool because truely brave man said on a subject which has given us all so much terror  But was he not very good my dear not to say one word all this day of the important errand on which he came down And to  lead  the subjects of conversation with design as my aunt and grandmamma both thought as well as I that my uncle should  not  and to give me time to recover my spirits Yet when he did address himself to me never were tenderness and respect so engagingly mingled This my uncle observed as well as my aunt and Lucy How the duce said he does this Sir Charles manage it He has a way no man but him ever found outHe can court without speech He can take one's heart and say never a word Hay Harriet looking archly  MR Deane is comeIn charming health and spiritsThank God With what cordiality did Sir Charles and he embrace each other  Sir Charles attended my grandmamma home So we had not his company at supper Now convenience without its contrary He is her own son She is his own parent Such an unaffected love on both sidesSuch a sweetlyeasy yet respectful familiarity between them What additional pleasures must a young woman in my situation have when she can consider herself as the bond of union between the family she  is of and that she is entering into How dreadful on the contrary must be  her  case who is the occasion of propagating dissention irreconcilable hatred and abhorrence between her own relations and those of the man to whom she for life engages herself  My grandmother and Sir Charles were no sooner gone than my uncle began to talk with Mr Deane on the subject that is nearest all our hearts I was afraid the conversation would not be managed to my liking and having too just an excuse to ask leave to withdraw from bad or rather no rest last night I made use of it and here in my closet preparing now however for it am I  Your everaffectionate HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XLIII  Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Wednesday Morning Nov    SIR Charles let my grandmother come hither by herself He is gone to visit that Greville We are all in pain for him But Mr Deane comforts us  After breakfast thus began my uncle upon me  Here Dame Selby are we still  at a fault  Harriet knows not what she would be at and you uphold her in her  nonsenses  Delicacy Delicacy The duce take me if I have any notion of itWhat a  pize  are you about  Dear Sir why am I blamed said I What would you have me do that I have  not  done  Do  why I would have you give him his Day and keep to it  that  I would have you do And not shillyshally for everand subject the best of men to insults All your men will be easy and quiet when the ceremony is over and they know there is no remedy  My good Mr Selby said my grandmamma you  now blame without reason Sir Charles was full hasty Harriet was a little more nice perhaps her Lover considered than she needed to be Yet I don't know but I in her case should have done as she did and expected as much time as she was willing to take It was not a  very  long one Mr Selby from the declaration he made and he is a man himself of great delicacy Harriet very readily acknowleged to him the preference she gave him to all them and when she found him very earnest for a short day she by her last Letter threw herself generously into his power He is full of acknowlegements upon it and so he ought to be To me he has said all that a man should say of his gratitude upon the occasion and he declared to me last night that it was with difficulty he forbore taking advantage of her goodness to him But that he checked himself and led to other subjects seeing how much the dear creature was disordered and being apprehensive that if he had begun upon one so interesting or even wished to talk with her alone he should have increased her disorder  Oy Oy Sir Charles is considerate and Harriet should be grateful But indeed my Dame Selby is as silly to the full as Harriet She is for having Harriet keep  her  in countenance in the dance she led me so many years agoLady G for my money She finds you all out in your Masonry  Mr Selby said my aunt I only refer myself to what our venerable parent just said  And so don't think it worth while to hold an argument with me I suppose  I did not know my dear that you wanted to hold an argument  Your servant madamwith that sly leer  So  like Harriet and Harriet  so  like you  But Mr Selby said my grandmamma will you be pleased to tell the dear child if you think her wrong what is the next step she should take  Think her wrongNext stepWhy the next step is as she has promised to oblige him and to be directed by him to keep her word and not  hum  nor  haw  about the matter  Mr Deane who had been shewn and told everything that had passed since we saw him last said You don't  know  that my daughter Byron will make unnecessary parade Mr Selby Sir Charles you find in tenderness to her asked no questions yesterday made no claim  She  could not begin the subject  But said Lucy I cannot but say that my cousin is in some fault  Look you there now said my uncle  We all stared at Lucy for she spoke and looked very seriously  Might she not have said proceeded she when Sir Charles surprized her at his first arrival what tho' her heart was divided between past terror and present joy Here I am Sir at your service Are you prepared for tomorrowAnd then made him one of her best courtesies  SauceboxWell well I believe I have been a little hasty in my judgment rapping under the table with his knuckles But I am so afraid that something will happen between the cup and the lipHere last night I dreamt that Lady Clementina and he were going to be marriedGive me your hand my dear Harriet and don't revoke the  kindness  in your last Letter to him but whatever be the day he proposes comply and you will win my heart for ever  As Sir Charles  leads  Harriet must  follow  resumed my grandmamma You men are sad prescribers in these delicate cases Mr Selby You will be put to it my dear love taking my hand before this day is over now you seem so purely recovered Sir Charles Grandison is not a dreaming Lover Prepare your mind my child You'll be put to it I do assure you  Why oy I can't but say Sir Charles is a manDon't you my  lovely Love  be too much a womanToo close a copier of your aunt Selby hereand as I said you will have my heart for everOy and Sir Charles's too for he is not one of your sorry fellows that can't distinguish between a favour and a folly  My uncle then went out with a flourish and took Mr Deane with him leaving only my grandmamma my aunt my Lucy and your Harriet together  We had a good deal of talk upon the important subject The conclusion was that I would refer Sir Charles to my grandmamma if he were urgent for the day and she was vested with a discretionary power to determine for her girl  Such of my cloaths then as were near finished were ordered to be produced with some of the nuptial ornaments They were all to sit in judgment upon them  Surely Lady G these are solemn circumstances lightly as my uncle thinks of them Must not every thoughtful young creature on so great a change and for life have conflicts in her mind be her prospects ever so happy as the day approaches Of what materials must the hearts of runaways and of fugitives to men halfstrangers to them be compounded  My aunt has just left with me the following Billet from Sir Charles directed to my uncle from Mr Greville's  Dear Mr  Selby  I Regret every moment that I pass out of Selbyhouse or Shirleymanor And as I have so few particular friends in these parts out of your family I think I ought to account to you for the hours I do Nor will I now our friendship is so unalterably fixed and acknowleged apologize for giving myself by this means the consequence with your family that every one of yours for their single sakes are of to me  superadded to the tenderest attachments to one dear person of it  I found the gentleman in a less happy disposition than I expected  It is with inexpressible reluctance that he thinks as my happy day draws near of giving up all hopes of an object so dear to him He seemed strangely balancing on this subject when I was introduced to him He instantly proposed to me and with some fierceness that I would suspend all thoughts of marriage for  two  months to come or at least for  one  I received his request with proper indignation He pretended to give reasons respecting himself I allowed not of them  After some canvassings he swore that he would be complied with in  something  His alternative was the dining with him and with some of his chosen friends whom he had invited  I have reason to think these friends are those to whom he expressed himself with violence at the George as overheard I suppose by the waiter there  He rode out he owned yesterday morning with intent to meet me for he boasts that he knows all my motions and those of a certain beloved young Lady Let him let everybody who think it their concern to watch our steps be made acquainted with them The honest heart aims not at secrets I should glory in receiving Miss Byron's hand from yours Sir before ten thousand witnesses  Mr Greville had rode out the night before he did not say to meet me but he knew I was expected at Selbyhouse either on Monday night or yesterday morning And on his return not meeting me he and his friends passed their night at the George as mentioned and rode out together in the morningIn hopes of meeting me he said and to engage me to suspend my happy day Poor man Had he been in his  right mind  he could not have hoped had he met  me on the road to have been  heard  on such a subject  An act of oblivion and thorough reconciliation he calls it is to pass in presence of his expected friends  You will not take notice of what I have hinted at out of the family whatever was designed  In the temper he would have found me in had he met me nothing unhappy could have happened for he is really to be pitied  We are now perfect friends He is full of good wishes He talks of a visit to Lady Frampton of a month I write thus particularly that I may not allow such a subject as this to interfere with that delightful one which engrosses my whole attention and which I hope in the evening will be honoured with the attention of the beloved and admired of every heart as well as of that of  Your everobliged and affectionate CH GRANDISON  Poor wicked GrevilleMay he go to Lady Frampton's or whereever else so it be fifty miles distant from us I shall be afraid of him till I hear he has quitted for a time his seat in this neighbourhood  What a glorious quality is courage when it is divested of rashness When it is founded on integrity of heart and innocence of life and manners But otherwise founded Is it not rather to be called  savageness  and  brutality  How much trouble have I given your brother What dangers have I involved him in It cannot be possible for me evre to reward himBut the proudest heart may deem it a glory to owe obligation to Sir Charles Grandison  LETTER XLIV  Miss  BYRON  In Continuation  Wednesday Night Nov    SIR Charles broke away and came hither by our teatime I was in my closet writing They all crouded about him He avoided particulars Only said that all was friendship between Mr Greville and himself and that Mr Greville came with him part of the way full of his resumed scheme of appearing to be upon a good understanding with him and a friend to the alliance between him and us  Sir Charles looked about him as if for somebody he saw not My aunt came up to me My dear do you know who is come She then told me the above particulars We had a summons to tea Down we hastened He met us both at the parlourdoor O madam said he what precious hours have I lostI have been patience itself  I congratulated him on what my aunt had told me I found he intended as he says in his Billet that the particulars he gave in it should answer our curiosity and to have done with the subject What a charming possession of himself that he could be in such a brangle as I may call it and which might have had fatal consequences yet to be so wholly and so soon divested of the subject and so infinitely agreeable upon half a score others as they offered from one or other as we sat at tea  Tea was no sooner over but he singled me outMay I madam beg the favour of a halfhour's audience  Sir Sir hesitated the simpleton and was going to betray my expectation by expressing some little reluctance but recollecting myself I suffered him to lead me into the Cedar parlour When there seating  meNow madam let me again thank you a thousand and a thousand times for the honour of your last condescending Letter  He but just touched my hand and appeared so  encouragingly  respectfulI must have loved him then if I had not before  You have my dearest Miss Byron a man before you that never can be ungrateful Believe me my dearest Life tho' I have urged you as I have you are absolutely your own mistress of the day and of every day of my life as far as it shall be in my power to make you so You part with power my lovely Miss Byron but to find it with an increase Only let me beseech you now I have given it you back again not to permit your heart to be swayed by  mere  motives of punctilio  A charming glow had overspread his cheek and he looked as when I beheld him in his sister's dressingroom after he had rescued me from the hands of the then cruel now mortified Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  Punctilio  mere  punctilio Sir shall  not  weigh with me What I wrote to you I intend to comply with My heart Sir is  Yours  I would have saidWhy would not my tongue speak itMy my I stammeredWhy did I stammerHad I not owned it  before  to be soMy grandmamma Sir and auntI could not at that instant for my life say another word  Sweet confusion I urge you no more on this topic just now I joyfully take your reference Then drawing a chair next me he kissed his own hand and held it out as it were courting mine I yielded it to him as by an involuntary motionyet my heart was forwarder than my hand He tenderly grasped itretaining itand instead of urging the approaching day talked to me as if it were past  I have a request to make to your grandmother your uncle and aunt your Lucy and our Mr Deane it  is a very bold one That when I have been blessed with your hand they will be so good as to accompany their beloved Harriet then no more Byron but Grandison to my familyseat and see the beloved of every heart happily fixed and in possession of it The house is venerable I will not call it old but large and convenient Compassion for your neighbouring admirers will induce you to support me in this request You cannot bear I imagine without a lessening of your own joy if I prove the just the grateful man to you that if I know myself I shall be either to see at church or in your visits those men who preferred you to all women or if they forbear the one or the other to account with a gentle sigh for their forbearance Other women might triumph secretly on such occasions but I even I the successful the distinguished man shall not forbear some inward pity for them Now madam an excursion of a month or two if no more made by those dear friends who otherwise will be loth so soon as I wish to part with you will  wean  as I may say these unhappy men from you Mr Orme Mr Greville will not then be obliged to quit their own houses and this neighbourhood I shall not whenever I step into company see dejected men whose dejection is owing as they will think to my happiness All your  new  relations will attend you in turn in the house that I always loved and wished to settle in your own relations with you and witnesses of our mutual happinessSupport me generously support me in this proposal when I shall be intitled by your goodness to make itSilent my dearest LoveIf I have been too early in thus opening my heart to you do me the justice to suppose that it is owing to my wishes to pass over another interesting subject which must take place before my proposal can and which however engages my whole heart  I might well be silent I could not find utterance  for the emotions of my heart I withdrew my hand to take my handkerchief You have often told me Lady G that I was born in an April morning but putting it into my other hand I gratefully I hope not too fondly laid it in his way to take it again He did with an air that had both veneration and gratitude in itMy dearest Life tenderly grasping ithow amiable this goodnessYou are not I see displeased  DispleasedO Sir CharlesBut alas while I am tootoo happy the exalted Lady abroadShe she only Your friend Jeronymo's last Letter  Thus brokenly did I express what my heart was full of her worthiness my inferiority  Exalted creatureAngelic goodness You are Clementina and Harriet both in one One mind certainly informs you both  Just then came in my aunt Selby I have madam said he to her been making a request to your beloved niece I am exceedingly earnest in it She will be so good as to break it to you and I hope  O Sir interrupted my too eager aunt supposing it had been for the Day Mrs Shirley has the power  My dear aunt Selby said I  What have I said Love  He caught eagerly at itHappy mistake said he My dear Mrs Selby I thank you  He bowed kissed my hand and left me to go to my grandmamma to inform himself of what he had to hope for as to the Day from her  I told my aunt what the request was and what a conversation we had had And what madam said I have you done  My aunt approved of his proposal It will be the pride of your uncle's heart and mine to see you settled in Grandisonhall  What short work did my grandmamma make of it In less than a quarter of an hour Sir Charles returned overjoyed with an open Billet in his hand from the venerable parent This is it  'TO me my Harriet you have referred the most important Day of your life May the Almighty shower down his blessings on it Thursday next week is the Day that God willing shall crown the happiness of us all Make no objections my dearest child Hasten to me and say you acquiesce chearfully in the determination of  'Your everaffectionate 'HENRIETTA SHIRLEY'  Had you seen my dear Charlotte with what tender respect your brother approached me and with what an inimitable grace he offered me the open Billet how would you have been charmed with him The excellent Mrs Shirley said he would not permit me to bring this inestimable paper folded I have contemplated the propitious lines all the way On my knee let me thank you my dear Miss Byron for your acquiescence with her determination He kissed my hand on one knee  He saw me disturbed Could I help it There is something awful in the fixing of the  very  Day Lady G but I tried to recover myself I would fain avoid appearing guilty of affection in his eyes I will not add a word more my Angel said he on the joyful subject Only tell me Shall we hasten to attend the condescending parent  My duty to  her  Sir said I but with more hesitation than I wished shall be an earnest of that which I am so soon so  very  soon to vow to  you  And I gave him my hand  There is no describing to you my dear Lady G the looks the manner with which it was received by the most ardent and yet most respectful of Lovers  I had scare approaced my grandmamma and begun to utter something of the  much  my heart was filled with when my Uncle and Mr Deane by mistake I believe were admitted  Well let us know everything about it said my uncleI hope Sir Charles is pleased I hope  The Day was named to him  Well well thank God And he spoke in an accent that expressed his joy  Your niece has pleased you now I hope Mr Selby said my grandmamma  Pretty well pretty well God grant that we meet with no  Putoffs  I hardly longed so much for my own Day with my Dame Selby there as I have done and do to see my Harriet Lady GrandisonGod God bless you my dearest love and kissed my cheekYou have been very  very  good in the mainAnd but for Dame Selby would have been better as far as I know  You don't do me justice my dear replied my aunt  Don't INor did I evertaking kindly her handIt was impossible my dear Sir Charles Grandison for such a man as I to do justice to this excellent woman  You  never Sir will be so  froppish  as I have been It was in my nature I could not help it But I was always sorry for it  afterwards  But if Harriet make you no worse a wife than my Dame Selby has made me you will not be unhappyAnd yet I was led a tedious dance after her before I knew what she would be atI had like to have forgot that But one thing I have to request proceeded my uncleMr Deane and I have been talking of itGod bless your dear souls all of you oblige meIt is That we may have a joyful Day of it and that all our neighbours and tenants may rejoice with us I must make the village smoke No  huggermugger  doingsLet private weddings be for doubtful  happiness    O my uncle said I  And O my niece too I  must  have it so Sir Charles what say  you  Are you for chambermarriagesI  say  that such are neither  decent  nor  godly  But you would not allow Lady G to come off soAnd in your  own  case  Am for doing as in Lady G's I must hope to pay my vows at the Altar to this excellent Lady What says my Miss Byron  I Sir hope to return mine in the same sacred place my face as I felt in a glow but yet I shall wish to have it as private as possible  Why oy to be sureWhen a woman is to do anything she is ashamed ofI think she is right to be private for  example  sake Shall  you  be ashamed Sir Charles  Sir Charles has given it under his hand this very day said Lucy interrupting him as he was going to speak that he shall glory in receiving my cousin's hand before ten thousand witnesses  Make but my dearest Miss Byron easy on this head said Sir Charles That task Ladies be yours and so the Church be the place I shall be happy in the manner  The ceremony said my grandmamma  cannot  be a private one with us Everybody's eyes are upon us It would be an affectation in us that would rather raise than allay curiosity  And I have as good as promised the two pretty Nedhams said my uncleand Miss Watson and her cousin are in expectation  O my uncle  Dear Harriet forgive me These are your companions from childhood You can treat them but once in your life in this way They would be glad at heart to return the favour  I withdrew Lucy followed me  You  Lucy I see said I are for these public doingsBut you would not if it were your own case  Your  case is  my  case Harriet I should hardly bear being made a shew of with any other man But with such a man as yours if I did not  hold up my head  I  should give leer for stare to see how envy sat upon the womens faces  You  may leer at the  men  for the same reason It will be a wicked day after all Harriet for a general envy will possess the hearts of all beholders  Lucy you know my dear Lady G is a whimsical girl  So my dear the solemn Day is fixed If you could favour me with your supporting presenceI know if you come you will be very good now I have not as I hope you will think been guilty of much no not of any paradeLucy will write Letters for me to Lady D to my cousin Reeves's and will undertake all matters of ceremony for her Harriet May I but have the happiness to know that Lady ClementinaWhat  can  I wish for Lady ClementinaBut should she be unhappythat would be an abatement of my felicity indeed  There is no such thing as thinking of the dear Emily What a happiness could I have seen Lady L hereBut that cannot be May the Day that will in its  anniversary  be the happiest of  my  life give to  Lord  and  Lady L  their most earnest wishes  Sir Charles dispatches Frederick tomorrow to town with Letters He will bring you mine I would not go to rest till I had finished it  What have I more to sayI seem to have a great deal My head and my heart are full Yet it is time to draw to a conclusion  Let me my dearest Lady G know if I am to have any hopes of your presence Will you be so good as to manage with Emily  My aunt bids me suppose to you that since we are to have all the world of  our  acquaintance you should bring down your aunt Grandison with youWe have at both houses a great deal of room  Sir Charles just now asked my grandmamma Whether Dr Curtis would be satisfied with a handsome  present if every one's dear Dr Bartlett were to perform the ceremony My grandmamma answered That Dr Curtis was one of my admiring friends He had for years even from my girlhood prided himself with the hopes of joining my hand in marriage especially if the office were performed in Northamptonshire She was afraid he would think himself slighted and he was a worthy man  Sir Charles acquiesced But greatly as I respect Dr Curtis I should have preferred the venerable Dr Bartlett to any man in the world A solemn solemn subject tho' a joyful one  Adieu adieu my dear Lady G Be sure continue to love me I will if possible deserve your Love  Witness  HARRIET BYRON  LETTER XLV  Lady  G  To Miss  BYRON  Friday Morning Nov    EXpect a Letter of hurry in answer to one two three four five six I don't know how many of yours some filled with tenderness some with love some with nicety sense and nonsense I shall reckon with you soon for one of them in which you take intolerable liberties with me O Harriet tremble at my resentment You are downright scurrilous my dear  I imputed extravagance to Emily in my last The girl's a good girl I was too hasty I will shew you two Letters of hers and one of my brother which clears up the imputation I love her more and more Poor girl Love peeps out in twenty places of hers In his he is the best of men But that you knew before  And so the honest man kissed you kissed your lip  O Lud O Lud how could you bear him afterwards in your sightForgiving creatureAnd so you were friends with him before you had time to shew your angerNothing like doing impudent things in a hurrySometimes respectful sometimes free Why this is the way of all the fellows HarrietAnd so they go on till the respectfulness is drawn off and nothing but the lees are left and after two or three months are over the once squeamish palate will be glad of  them  I like your uncle better than I like either your aunt or youHe likes me  What a miserable dog Take the word for shortness I am in haste is Sir Hargrave  Your plea against Clementina being  compelled  or  over  persuaded the same thing I much like You are a good girl  Betwixt her excellencies and yours how must my brother's soul be dividedI wonder he thinks of either of you Ass and two bundles of hay Harriet But my brother is a nobler animal He won't starve But I think in my conscience he should have you both There might be a law made that the case should not be brought into precedent till two such women should be found and such a man and all three in the like situation  Bagenhall a miserable devil Excellent warningpieces  Wicked Harriet You infected me with your horrible inferences from Greville's temper threatenings andsoforth The conclusion of this Letter left me a wretchIf these megrims are the effect of Love thank Heaven I never knew what it was  Sufficient to the day  andsoforth  Devilish girl to torment me with your dreams If you ever tell me of any more of them except they are of a different sort woe be to you  I like your parting seene and all that Your  realities  thank Heaven are more delightful than your  resveries  I hope you'll always find them so  And so you were full of apprehensions on the favour your aunt did me in employing me about your  nuptial equipments  Long ago  'you gave affectation to the winds'  Good But the winds would not accept of your present They puffed it you back again and your servants never told you it was brought home I repeat my dear that my brother is much more clever in these scenes of Love and Courtship than his mistress You are a pretty cow my Love You give good store of milk but you have a very careless heel Yet when you  bethink  you you are very good but not always the same Harriet Your nurse in your infancy  seesawed  you  Margerydawn  and you can't put the pretty play out of your practice tho' it is out of your memory I can look back and sometimes by your frowardness sometimes by your crowing know how it was with you eighteen years ago  My brother's Letter to you after he has mentioned his visits to the two sick Baronets is that of a man who shews you genteelly and politely that he is sensible he has a pretty trifler to deal with I wish you would square your conduct by what you must imagine a man of his sense would think of you I should be too proud a minx in your case to owe obligation to my man for bearing with meSpare me spare me Harriet I have hit myself a terrible box o' the ear But we can find faults in others which we will not allow to be such in ourselvesBut here is the difference between your conduct now and what mine was I  knew  I was wrong and resolved one day to amend You think yourself right and while you so think will hardly ever mend till your man ties you down to good behaviour  Jeronymo's Letter O the next to divine Clementina Indeed Harriet I think she outsoars you I adore her But will she be prevailed upon to marry  She willIf she doesThenBut dear SoulPressed as she isHaving refused instead of being refused the beloved of her heart she will still be greater than any of her Sex if she does the man proposed so unexceptionable so tenderly loving her in the height of her calamity as well as in her prosperityGratitude to him as well as Duty to her parents parents so indulgent as they have always been to her will incline her to marry May she be happy I am pleased with your solicitude for her happiness  I like your answer to my brother A good and welldeserved resignation Let's see how you keep to it  You do keep to it  as I expected  Ah Harriet you are quite a girl sometimes tho' at others more than woman  'Will he not ask leave to come down'  Fine resignation  'Will he not write first'  Yes yes  he  will do everything he ought to do Look to your own behaviour child don't fear but  his  will be all as it should be As to your finery how now Harriet Are  you  to direct everything yet pretend to ask advice Be contented that everything is  done for you  of this sort and learn to be humble Sure we that have passed the Rubicon are not to be directed by you who never came in sight of the river But you maidens are poor proud pragmatical mortals You profess ignorance but in  heart  imagine you are at the tiptop of your wisdom  But here you come with your horrid fears again Would to the Lord the Day were over and you and my brother  were  Upon my lifeyou are aBut I won't call you names  Lucy thinks you should go to Shirleymanor when my brother comes down Egregious folly I did not think Lucy could have been so silly  Concerning our cousin Reeves's wanting to be present at your nuptialsyour invitation to meand what you say of Emilymore anon  Well and so my brother has sent you the expected  Letter Does it please you Harriet The duce is in you if it don't  But you are  not  pleased with it it seems He is too hasty for you Where's the boastedof resignation Harriet True  Female  resignation  Tell Lucy I am obliged to her for her transcriptions I shall be very proud of her correspondence  'Your  aunt  thinks he is full hasty'Your aunt's a simpleton as well as you My service to her  But is the DI in the girl again What would have become of Lady L and me had you not sent both Letters together that relate to Greville's supposed malignance I tremble nevertheless at the thought of what might have been But I will not forgive Lucy for advising you to send to us your horriblypainted terrors What could possess  her  to advise you to do so and  you  to follow her advice I forgive not either of you In revenge I will remind you that you are one of the  good women  to whom he owes all the embarrasments of his past life  But a caution HarrietNever never let foolish dreams claim a moment of your attentionImminent as seemed the danger your superstition made more dreadful to you than otherwise it would have been You have a mind superior to such foibles Act up to its native dignity and let not the follies of your nurses in your infantile state be carried into your maturer age to depreciate your womanly reason Do you think I don't dream as well as you  Well might ye all rejoice in his safety  'Hang about his neck for joy'  So you ought if you thought it would do him honour Hush hush proud girl don't scold me I think were a king your man he would have been honoured by the charming freedom  'Cast himself at your feet'  And you ought to have cast yourself at his  'There can be no reserve to him after this'  you say Nor ought there had it not been for this Did you not signify to him  by Letter that you would resign to his generosity Let me whisper you HarrietSure you proud maiden minxes  think  But  I  did onceI wonder in my heart oftentimesBut men and women are chears to one another But we may in a great measure thank the poetical tribe for the fascination I hate them all Are they not inflamers of the worst passions With regard to the  Epics  would Alexander madman as he was have been so  much  a madman had it not been for Homer Of what violences murders depredations have not the Epic poets been the occasion by propagating false honour false glory and false religion Those of the  amorous class  ought in all ages could their future genius's for tinkling sound and measure have been known to have been strangled in their cradles Abusers of talents given them for better purposes for all this time I put Sacred poesy out of the question and  avowedly  claiming a right to be  licentious  and to overleap the bounds of decency truth and nature  What a rant How came these fellows into my rambling head O I rememberMy whisper to you led me into all this stuff  Well and you at last recollected the trouble you have given my brother about you Good girl Had I remembered that I would have spared you my reflexions upon the poets and poetasters of all ages the  truly  inspired ones excepted And yet I think the others should have been banished  our  commonwealth as well as Plato's  Well but to shorten  my  nonsense now  you  have shortened yoursThe Day is at last fixedJoy joy joy to you my lovely Harriet and to my Brother And it must be a public affairWhythat's right since it would be impossible to make it a private one My honest man is mad for joy He fell down on his knees to beg of me to accept of  your  invitation and of  his  company I made a merit of obliging him  tho' I would have been as humble to  him  rather than not be with you and yet by one saucy line I imagine you had rather be without me  Your cousin Reeves's are ready to set out  God bless you invite aunt Nell She thinks herself neglected A nephew whom she so dearly loves Very hard she saysAnd she never was but at one wedding and has forgot how it was and may never be at anotherPink and yellow all is ready provided go down or notO but if you choose not her company I will tell you how to come offGive her your word and honour that she shall be a person of prime account at your first Christening Yet she would be glad to be present on both occasions  But ah the poor EmilyShe has also been on her knees to me to take her down with meWhat shall I doDear Soul she embarrasses me I have put her upon writing to her Guardian for his leave I believe she has written If she knew her own case I think she would not desire it  Poor Lady LShe is robbed she says of one of the greatest pleasures of her life Ah Charlotte said she to me wringing my hand these husbands owe us a great deal This is an humbling circumstance Were not my Lord and yours the best of husbands  The best of husbands Wretches said I You may forgive yours CarolineYou are a good creature but not I mine And something else I said that made her laugh in the midst of her  lacrymals  But she begs and prays of me not to go down to you unless all should be over with her I can do her no good and only increase my own apprehensions if I am with her A blessed way two poor souls of sisters of us are in Sorry fellows  And yet Harriet with such prospects as these before them some girls leap windows swim rivers climb wallsDuce take their folly Their choice is  their punishment Who can pity such rash souls as those Thanks be praised you Harriet are going on to keep in countenance the two anxious sisters  Who having shot the gulph delight to see  Succeeding souls plunge in with like uncertainty  Says a good man on a still  more  serious occasion  Good news joyful newsI shall I shall go down to you Nothing to hinder me Lord L proud as a peacock is this moment come for me I am hurrying away with him A fine boySister safeHarriet Lucy Nancy for your own future encouragement Huzzah girlsI am gone  LETTER XLVI  Miss  BYRON  To Lady  G  Thursday Nov    MY aunt is so much afraid that everything will not be ready that she puts me upon writting to you to hasten what remainsI am more than half a foolBut that I always was My spirits sink at the thoughts of so public a Day The mind my grandmamma says can but be full and it would have been filled by the circumstance had not the publicness of the Day given me something more of grievance  I am afraid sometimes that I shall not support my spirits that I shall be illThen I think something will happenCan it be that I shall be the wife of Sir Charles Grandison I can hardly believe itSir Charles is tenderly concered for me It would be impossible he says that the Day could be private unless I were to go to London and the very proposing of that would put my uncle out of all patience who prides himself in the thought of having his Harriet married from his own house Nor could I expect my  grandmamma's presence He does all he can to assure my heart and divert me A thousand agreeable lively things he says So tender so considerate in his joysurely I shall be too happy But will you come Can you And if you do will you be good Will you make my case your own  My uncle at times is prodigiously headstrong Every hour he does or says something wrong yet we dare not chide him Thursday next will be one of the greatest days of his life he says and it shall be all his own He either sings hums or whistles in every motion He resolves he says to get his best dancing legs in readiness He started up from table after dinner this day and caught hold of Lucy's hand and whisked her round the room  Dear toad  he called her a comman address of his to Lucy I say because she has a jewel in her head and flourishing about with her in a very humorous manner put her quite out on purpose to laugh at her for she would have been in if he would have let her for the humoursake He was a fine dancer in his youth  Miss Orme breakfasted with us this morning She no doubt threw herself in our way on purpose to hear the news of the appointed Day confirmed My uncle officiously told her it would be one day next week She named the very day and turned pale on his owning she was not mistaken She hoped she said her brother would bear the shock as he had been long destitute of hope But said she he promised me before he went abroad to carry me to London on a visit to some relations there I will remind him and hope to prevail on him to set out next Monday or Tuesday  God bless you my dear Miss Byron said she at parting may your bustle be happily over I shall pity you You will pay for being so universally admired But your penance will be but for two days the  very  Day and that of your  appearance  and in both your man will bear you out His merit his person his  address Happy Miss ByronThe universal approbation is yours But I must have you contrive some how that my brother may see him before he is yours His heart will be the easier afterwards  Sent for down by my grandmammaDear Lucy make up the Letter for me I know you will be glad of the opportunity  Continued by  Lucy  'Will Lady G admit me in this abrupt manner into her  Imperial presence  I know she will on this joyful occasion accept of any intelligence The poor Harriet My uncle Selby would invite all the country if they came in his way Four of my cousin's old playfellows have already been to claim his promise He wished he said he had room for all the world it should be welcome  'He will have the Great Barn as it is called cleared out a tight large building which is to be illuminated at night with a profusion of lights and there are all his tenants and those of Shirleymanor to be treated with their wives and such of their sons and daughters as are more than Twelve years old The treat is to be a cold one Hawkins his steward who is well respected by them all is to have the direction of it My uncle's October is not to be spared It will cost two days at least to roast boil and bake for them The carpenters are already sent for Half a dozen bonfires are to be lighted up round the Great Barn and the stacks of wood are not to be spared to turn winter into summer as my uncle expresses himself  'Neither the poor nor the populace are to be admitted that the confusion almost unavoidable from a promiscuous multitude may be avoided But notice will be given that two houses in the neighbouring village held by tenants of the family and one near Shirleymanor will be opened at Twelve on Thursday and be kept open for the rest of the day  till Ten at night for the sake of all who choose to go thither The Churchwardens are preparing a list of the poor people who on Friday morning  were  to receive  Five  shillings apiece which Sir Charles has desired to make  Ten  on condition that they shall not be troublesome on the day  'Poor Sir Hargrave to whom all this joyful bustle is primarily owingI tell Harriet that she has not with all her punctilio been half punctilious enough She should have had him after all on the motive of Prince Prettiman in the  Rehearsal  'Dear madam can your Ladyship allow of this idle rattle But I have not time to make up for it by a ceremonious conclusion tho' I am with the truest respect Lady G's  Most obedient humble Servant LUCY SELBY  LETTER XLVII  Lady  G  To Miss  BYRON  Saturday Nov    I Write a few lines if writing to you I can write a few by the special messenger that carries down all the remaining apparatus which was committed to my care We women are sad creatures for delaying things to the last moment We hurry the men We hurry our workwomen milaners mantuamakers friends allies confederates and ourselves When once we have given the Day night  and  day we neither take rest nor give it When if we had the  rare  felicity of knowing our minds sooner all might go on fair and softly But then the gentle passion I doubt would glide into insipidity Well and I have heard my brother say  'That things in general are best as they are'  Why I believe so for all these honest souls as mantuamakers attirewomen workwomen  enjoy  a hurry that is occasioned by a wedding and are half as well pleased with it as if it were their own They simper smirk gossip over Bridal finery spread this upon their arms or shoulders admire thatLook you hereLook you there And is not thisIs not thatAnd Did you everNo never in my born daysAnd is the Bride do you say such a lovely creatureAnd is the Bridegroom as handsome a man as she a womanO lud O dearWould to Heaven Northamptonshire were nearer that one might see how charming how graceful how becoming and soforth  And why should not we women after all contrive to make hurryskurries You see how I correct myself as I go along and make the world think our affairs a great part of the business of it and that nothing can be done without us Since after a few months are over new novelties take place and we get into corners sigh groan look silly and meagre and at last are thrown into  straw  as it is called poor Caroline's case who repines that she can't be present on this new bustle in the family But I am to write her word of everythingLook to your behaviour Harriet on the great occasion  But a word about CarolineWere it not for her being deprived of this pleasure the good creature would be very happy Lord L and she are as fond as apes She has quite forgot all her sufferings for him He thanks her for his boy She follows with her eye the little stranger and is delighted with all that is done  with  him  to  him  for  him Is pleased with everybody even with the very servants who croud in by permission to see his little Lordship and already claim an interest in him Upon my word she makes a very pretty fond mother And aunt Nell who by the way was at the Cryingout and was then  so  frighted  so  thankful to God and  so  happy in her own situation No not for the world would she be other than she was now grudges the nurses half their cares  What good creatures are we women  Well but I don't know what to do about Emily The first vice of the first woman was curiosity and it runs through all her daughters She has written to her Guardian and nothing but an absolute prohibition will hinder her from making one in your train Did the dear girl know the state of her own heart she would choose to be a thousand miles off rather than go I have set her woman and mine to discourage her I have reasoned with her myself but there is no such thing as giving her one's  true  reasons nor would I willingly Because she herself having not found out her Love to be Love I hope the fire may be smothered in her own heart by the aid of time and discretion before discovery whereas if the doors of it were to be opened and the air let in it might set the whole tenement in a blaze Her Guardian's denial or assent will come perhaps in time yet  hardly  neither for we shall set out on Monday Aunt Nell is so pleased with her nursery of the  little Peer  as she primly calls him that you are rid of even her  wishes  to be with you Being sure of this I complimented her that I knew your aunt Selby would have invited her but that Lady L would not be able to live without her company all the world and the world's wise attentive and engrossed by your affair She good creature was pleasedSo as she could but be thought of importance by somebody I knew she would be happy I told her that you invited nobody but left all to your friendsAy poor dear Soul said she she has enough to think of well as she loves your brotherand sighed for  you  Worthy Ancient The sigh a little deeper perhaps for some of her own Recollections  Mr and Mrs Reeves would not stay for us What will you do with us allCroud you I sear But dispose of  us  at Shirleymanor or Selbyhouse as you please Yours and aunt Selby's and grandmamma  Shirley's concern for us is all we are solicitous about But servants rooms nay cocklofts haylofts will do We like to be put to our shifts nowandthenSomething to talk of  But I can tell you if you don't know it already Lord W and his Lady are resolved to do you honour on this occasion but they will be but little trouble to you My Lord's steward has a halfbrother a gentlemanfarmer in your neighbourhoodSheldonThey will be there But perhaps you know of this a better way They will make a splendid part of your train Gratitude is their inducement  Lord L has just now told me that my sister in tenderness to him and in honour to you has besought  him  to be present O Harriet what will you do with yourselfAunt Nell and I have the heartburn for you But Lord L  must  be welcome He is one of those who so faithfully kept your secret  So in  our  equipages will be Lord L my honest man Emily and your Charlotte Lord L's equipages will be at the service of any of your guests as will our spare oneI wish Beauchamp could permit himself to be present I hope he will on the nuptials of the friend so dear to him with a Lady he so greatly admires  My woman and Emily's will be all our Female attendants One nook will serve them both  My poor man will be mad before the day comes He  does  love you Harriet My brother he says will be the happiest man in the world  himself excepted  A hypocrite He just popt this in to save himselfWhy dost make this exception friend said IThou knowest it to be a mere complimentIndeed indeed  two  indeeds which implied that  one  might have been doubted I am  now  A sarcasm in his word  now  as happy as mortal man can beAh flatterer and shook my headA recognition of my sovereignty however in his being afraid to speak his conscience A little of  the old leaven Harriet I can't help it It is got out of my heart half out of my head but when I take the pen it will tingle nowandthen at my finger's end  Adieu my Love God bless youI can enter into your joy A Love so pure and so fervent The man Sir Charles GrandisonAnd into your  pain  also in view of a solemnity so near and to you so awful With all my roguery I sympathize with you I have not either a wicked or unfeeling heart Such as yours however are the true spirits such as mine are only bully and flash  Lucy you are a good girl I like the whim of your concluding for Harriet I also like your tenants diningroom and other managements as the affair must unavoidably be a public one  Neither of you say a word of good Mr Deane I hope he is with you He cannot be a cypher whereever be comes except on the rightside of the figure to increase its consequence Don't be afraid of your uncle I I I will manage him never fear  There are other passages Harriet in your last Letter which I ought to have answered toBut forgive me my dear I had laid it by tho' pleased with it in the main and having answered the most material part by dispatching your things forgot it as much as if I had not received it till the moment I came to conclude Once more Adieu my dearest Harriet  CH G  LETTER XLVIII  Miss  JERVOIS  To Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  Friday Nov    NO sooner dear and honoured Sir is one boon granted me but I have another to beg yet I blush as I write for my troublesomeness I told you  Sir I

and grateful EMILY JERVOIS  LETTER XLIX  Sir  CHARLES GRANDISON  To Miss  JERVOIS  Sunday Nov    IT would give me great pain to deny to my good Miss Jervois the grant of any request she shall think fit to make to me You shall know you say by the grant of this favour that I have quite forgiven my ward Was such a test wanted my dear I assure you that what you have lately done for your mother tho' I was not consulted in it has heightened my opinion of the worthiness of your heart  As to your request I have pleasure in leaving everything relating to the happy event to my beloved Miss Byron and her friends I will entreat her to underwrite her mind on this subject She grieves that the solemnity cannot be private which beloved as she is in this neighbourhood would be vain to attempt  If her aunt has no objection from want of room there cannot my dear Emily be any from  Your affectionate and true Friend CH GRANDISON  Underwritten  My dearest Miss Jervois will excuse me that I gave her not a formal invitation when I intimated my wishes for Lady G's presence on the approaching solemn occasion tho' at so many miles distance It is a  very  solemn one One's heart my dear cannot be so much disengaged as to attend to invitations for the  very  Day as it might on its  anniversary  We shall have too great a number of friends O my dear can you bear to make one in so large a company I shall not be able to attend to any of my friends on the Day No not to you my Love Can you bear with my inattention to everybody to every subject but one Can you desire to see your Harriet joyful as the occasion is and the chosen wish of her heart look and behave like a foolish creature If you can and Lady G will take charge of my lovely young friend all mine will rejoice in being able to contribute to your pleasure as well as  Your everaffectionate HARRIET BYRON  LETTER L  Lady  G  To Lady  L  Selbyhouse  Tuesday Nov    WELL my Sister my Friend my dear Lady L how do you  As well as can be expected  I hope The answer of a thousand years old to every enquirer careful or ceremonious And how does my dear little boy As well  as can be expected  tooI am glad of it  Here we areEverybody well and happy  I was afraid my brother would have looked more  polite  upon us than  familiar  as he invited us not But noHe was all himself as Harriet says He  met us at our coachdoor He handed out his ward She could not speak Tears were in her eyes I could have beat her with my fan He kissed her cheek My dear child I thank you most sincerely for your goodness to your mother  I was afraid that her joy would then have been too much for her She expanded she collected her plumes Her spread arms soon however closed shewed me that she with difficulty restrained herself from falling at his feet He turned from her to me My best Charlotte how do you The journey I hope has not incommoded you He led me out and taking each of the honest men by the hand My dean Lords you do me honour He then congratulated Lord L on the present you had made him and the family he said  At the innergate met us our sweet Harriet with joy upon one brow half the cares of this mortal life on the otherShe led us into the Cedarparlour my brother returning to welcome in the two honest men and threw her arms about my neckMy dearest Lady G how much does your presence rejoice meI hope and looked at me your journeyBe quiet HarrietYou must not think so much of these matters my Love She was a little abashedDon't be afraid of me I will be very good said I Then will I be very thankful replied she  My lovely Emily turning to her How does my sweet friend Welcome once more to Selbyhouse  The girl's heart was fullShe thanking her only by a deep courtesy abruptly withdrew to the window and trying for a third hem in hopes to stifle her emotion it broke into a halfsob and tears followed  Harriet and I looked  she  compassionately  I  vexedly I believe and both shook our heads at each other  Take no notice said I seeing Harriet move towards the window to herIt will go off of itself Her joy to see Harriet that's all  But I  must  take notice for she found that Emily heard her My dear Emily my lovely young friendwhy why  I will tell you madam interrupted she and threw her arms about Harriet's neck as Harriet sitting in the window clasped her's about her waist and I will tell you truth and nothing but the truthYou wrote so cool to me about my comingAnd yet I to come But I could not help itAnd I thought you now looked a little severely upon meBut Love and I will say Duty to you my dearest Miss Byron AND NOTHING ELSE made me so earnest to come Say you forgive me  Forgive you my dearest EmilyI had only your sake my dear in view If I wrote with less warmth than you expected forgive  me  Consider my situation my Love You are and ever will be welcome to me Your griefs your joys are mineGive me which you please  The girl burst into fresh tearsI I I am now as unable sobbed she to bear your goodness as before I was your displeasureBut hide hide me Here comes my GuardianWhat now when he sees me thus will become of me  She heard his voice at the door leading in the two Lords and they followed by Mr Selby Mrs Selby Lucy and Nancy  Sir Charles went to the two young Ladies Harriet kept her seat her arms folded about Emily Emily's glowing face in her bosom  Sweet emotion said he my Emily in tears of joy  What a charming pictureO my Miss Byron how does your tenderness to this amiable child oblige me I sever you not clasping his generous arms about them both  I have afflicted my dear Emily Sir without intending it I wrote coldly my precious young friend thinks and her Love for me makes her sweetlysensible  of my supposed ingratitude But believe me my dear I love you with a true sisterly tenderness  I took the dear girl aside and gently expostulated with her upon the childishness of her behaviour and the uneasiness she would give to Miss Byron as well as to herself by repetitions of the like weakness of mind  She promised fair but Lady L I wish there were more of the child and less of the woman in this affair Poor thing she was very thankful for my advice and expressed how wrong she was  because  it might discourage her Guardian and Miss Byron that  now was  from letting her live with them But for my life said she whatever was the matter with me I could not help my foolishness  Miss Nancy Selby took Emily up with her and uncle Selby and I had a little lively hit at each other in the old stile We drew my brother in I had not tried his strength a good while But as Harriet said in one of the sauciest Letters she ever wrote I soon found he was the wrong person to meddle with Yet he is such a charming raillier that I wonder he can resist his talent  No  wonder Harriet would say because he has talents so superior to that which she says runs away with his poor sister  Emily came down to us very composed and behaved prettily enough But had my brother as much mannish vanity as some of the sorry fellows have who have no pretence for it he would discern the poor Emily's foible to have some little susceptibility in it I am glad he does not for it would grieve him I have already told him of the sufferings of poor Lady Anne S on her hearing he is near marriage and he expressed great concern upon it for that reallyworthy woman  Mr Reeves his wife and Mr Deane were abroad when we arrived They came in to tea Our mutual congratulations on the expected happy event cheared our own hearts and would have delighted  yours Charming charming is the behaviour of my brother to his Brideelect You can have no notion of it because at Colnebrook we always saw him acting under a restraint owing as since we have found to Honour Conscience and a prior Love  He diverts and turns the course of subjects that he thinks would be affecting to her yet in such a manner as it is hardly perceivable to be his intention to do so For he makes something of the begun ones contribute to the new ones so that before uncle Selby is aware of it he finds himself in one that he had not in his head when he sat outAnd then he comes with his  'What a pize was I going to say But this is not what I had in my head'  And then as my brother knows he misses his scent only because it has not afforded the merry mortal something to laugh at he furnishes him with some lively and innocent occasion which produces that effect and then Mr Selby is satisfied Mrs Selby and Lucy see how my brother manages him yet find it so delicately done that something arises from it that keeps the honest man in credit with himself and everybody else for facetiousness goodhumour good heart and those qualities which really are his due and make him in his worst subjects tolerable and in his best valuable  Venerable Mrs Shirley is to be here all tomorrow and next day Mr Deane has chosen Shirleymanor for his abode for the time he stays so has James Selby in order to make more room at Selbyhouse for us women There too Mr and Mrs Reeves take up of choice their lodgings tho' here all day  Poor Harriet She told  me  once that fear makes cowards loving She is so fond of me and Lucy and her aunt at times it would be a sin not to pity her Yet Lucy once tossed up her head upon my saying soPity her why yes I think I do now you have put me in the head of it But I don't know whether she is not more to be envied Lucy is a polite girl  She loves her Harriet But she knew I should be pleased with the compliment to my brother  Harriet has just now looked in upon meWriting Lady G And of meTo Lady L I suppose  She clasped her arms about me Ah madam Thursday Thursday  What of Thursday  Is the day after tomorrow  Every child can tell that Harriet  Ah but I with such happiness before me am sillier  than  a child  Well but I can tell you something Harriet  What is that  That the next day to Thursday is FridayThe next to that is SaturdayThe next  Pish I'll stay no longer with you giving me a gentle tapI would not have answered you so  Away she tript desiring her affectionate compliments to dear Lady L  Let me see Have I any more to write I think not But a call for supper makes me leave my paper unsubscribed  EMILY behaved very prettily at supper but it would have been as well if she had not thought so herself For she boasted of her behaviour afterwards to me That made it look like an  extraordinary  in her own account  Mr Selby sung us a song with a good Foxhunter air There is something very agreeable in his facetiousness But it would become nobody else I think you and I agreed at Dunstable that he is a fine jolly hearty handsome  ish  manHe looks shrewd arch open a true country gentleman aspect what he says is  soso  What he means is betterHe is very fond of your LordBut I think rather fonder of  mine  A criterion Lady L  As for Lord G he is in the situation of Harriet's  SingletonHe is prepared to laugh the moment Mr Selby opens his mouth especially when he twists his neck about turns a glass upsidedown and looks under his bent brows at the company round yet the table always in his eye For then we know that something is collected and ready to burst forth  Well good night good night good nightHas my Godsonelect done crying yet What a duce has  he  to cry at Unswaddled unpinioned unswathed legs and arms at full liberty But they say crying does good to the bratsopens their pipesandsoforthBut tell him that if he does not learn to laugh as well as cry he shall not be related to  CHARLOTTE G  LETTER LI  Lady  G  In Continuation  Wedn Nov    WEdnesday is come and as Harriet says tomorrow is Thursday Ah Harriet rich as content poor as patience  I have been talking to her Halfcomforting her halflaughing at her She says I am but halfgoodAll the world is comeLord W and his everagreeable Lady Beauchamp as I am alive with them I wish I could see this rogue Emily in love with him He is certainly in love with her  'I know itI know itDo you go down about your business'  Only Lord G come to tell me what I knew before  Harriet's gone down to be complimented She has hardly spirits to compliment  'Well well I'll only tell Lady L who is come Does not the poor soul keep her bed And are we not to be as complaisant to our ill friends as our wellI am coming Child'  Emily with her pretty impertinence Neither Lord G nor Emily can be anything when strangers come and I stand not by them to shew their signification  Duce a third messengerO Mrs Selby herself I'll tell you more byandby Lady L  'Your servant Mrs Selby I attend you  THE two Miss Nedhams Miss Watson Miss Barclay the two Miss Holles's Mr Deane  'So so so Harriet said I what is the meaning of this'  My uncle's doings I have no spirits Sir Charles should not have been so passive He and nobody else could have prevailed upon my uncle My aunt has held him in till her arms aked O the dear restiff man She has now let go and you see how he prances over the whole meadow the reins upon his neck  Dear girl said I I am glad you are so fanciful  I would fain be lively if I could said she Never any creature had more reason Lady GMy heart is all Gratitude and I will say Love  Good girl hold up your head my dear and all will be as it should be  Sir Charles staid to attend hither the most venerable of women Mr and Mrs Revees are to come with them You must as you expect me to be minute be content with bits and scraps written by snatches of time I pity you for your stilllife my dear Lady L and think your request that I will so write as to make you suppose yourself on the spot a reasonable one  Here is come the man of men  WITH what respect all his Respect has Love in it did he attend Mrs Shirley to her seat And then hastening to Lord and Lady W he saluted them both and acknowleged the honour done him by their presence  an hour he said that he could not have expected nor therefore had the thought the distance so great of asking for it  He then paid his compliments in the most affectionate manner to his amiable friend Beauchamp who on his thanking him for his uninvited presence said He could not deny himself being present at a solemnity that was to complete the happiness of the best of men and best of friends  Sir Charles addressed himself to the young Ladies who were most strangers to him apologizing to them as they were engaged with Mr Selby Mr Deane and Lord G that he did not at first He sat a few minutes with them What he said I heard not but they smiled blushed and looked delighted upon each other Everybody followed him in his motions with their eye So much presence of mind never met with so much modesty of behaviour and so charming a vivacity  The young Ladies came only  intendedly  to breakfast and that at Mr Selby's odd invitation They had the good sense to apologize for their coming this day as they were to make part of the cavalcade as I may call it tomorrow But the odd soul had met the four at a neighbouring Lady's where he made a gossiping visit and would make them come with him  I observed that nobody cared to find fault with him so I began to rate him and a very whimsical dialogue passed between us at one end of the room while Sir Charles Mrs Shirley Mrs Selby Lady W and Harriet were in close talk at the other  I made the honest man ashamed of himself and everybody in our circle was pleased with us This misled me to go on and so by attending to his nonsense and pursuing my own I lost the opportunity of hearing a conversation which I dare say would have been worth repeating to you by pen and ink Harriet shall write and give it you  Mr Orme and his Sister we are told set out yesterday for London Mrs Selby and Harriet are yet afraid of Greville  The gentlemen and some of the Ladies myself but not Harriet among them have been to look at the preparations made in the lesser Park for the reception of the tenants Mr Selby prided himself not a little on his contrivances there When we returned we found Harriet at one end of the great parlour sitting with Emily her grandmother Mr Selby Lucy in conversation at the other the good girl's hand in hers Emily blushing looking down but delighted as it seemed Harriet with sweetness love and compassion intermingled in her aspect talking to her and bending over her her fine neck I thought I never saw her look so lovely Elder sister like and younger one instructing in love the other listening with pleasure They unobserved by themselves took everybody's attention as the room filled with the company who all crouded about Mrs Shirley affecting not to heed the two friends What would I give said Lady W to Sir Charles and her Lord for a picture of those two young Ladies Emily just then kissed the hand of her lovely friend with emotion and Harriet lifted up Emily's to her lips if Love Dignity and such Expression could be drawn in the face of one Lady and that Reverence Gratitude and modest Attention in the other I congratulate you Sir Charles with all my heart I have observed with rapture from every look every word and from the whole behaviour of Miss Byron that your goodness to hundreds will be  greatly  recompensed O my good Lord W turning to him Miss Byron will pay all our debts  Every attitude every look of Miss Byron's said my Lord would furnish out a fine picture I cannot keep my eye from her whereever she is  My brother bowed delighted  How pleased was Mrs Shirley Mrs SelbyEverybody But what a different man is Lord W to what he once was lifted up from low keeping to a wife who by her behaviour good sense politeness gives him consequence Once I thought him one of the lowest of men I denied him in my heart a relation to my mother and thought him a savage  The two young Ladies finding themselves observed stood up in a parting posture but Emily seeming eager to detain her dear friend's attention Harriet took a hand of Emily's in each of hers  I had fidled that wayYes my dear said the lovely Harriet friendship unalterable by time or fate as you say Dearest Emily command me ever  Emily looked about herO madam I want to  kneel  to you I will ever everMy good Lady G said Harriet approaching me one of Emily's hands in hers we have promised a friendship that is to continue to the end of our lives We are to tell each the other all her faults How causelesly has my Emily been accusing herselfThe most ingenuous of human hearts is hers  She left Emily's hand in mine and bent towards Mrs Shirley and the whole circle of friends surrounding her chair  O my dear Lady G said Emily whisperingly as we followed the meekeyed Goodness of Wisdom Such her air her manner her amiableness seemed in my thought at that time to make her never never was such graciousness I cannot hear her goodness What a happy creature shall I be if I follow her example and observe her preceptsYou cannot my dear said I have a better guide But Love you must not be capricious as you were at first coming She professed she would not I have been excusing myself to her madam said the dear girl and am    My brother met the lovely creature He took her hand and leading her towards her grandm ther We have been attentive my dearest life to you and Emily You love  her  She adores  you  My Beauchamp you know not the hundredth part of the excellencies of this admirable woman  You were born for each other God preserve you both for an example to a world that wants it  Harriet courtesied to Beauchamp Her face was overspread with a fine crimson but she attempted not to speak She squeezed herself as it were between the chairs of her grandmamma and aunt then turned about and looked  so  charmingly Miss Jervois Sir said she to my brother has the best of hearts She  deserves  your kind care How happy is she in such protection  And how much happier will she be in yours madam replied he Of what a care my Emily turning to her has this admirable Lady already relieved my heart the care the greater as you deserve it all In everything take her direction It will be the direction of love and prudence What an amiable companion will you make her and how happy will your love of each other make me  Emily got behind me as it were Speak for me to my guardian promise for me madamYou never never shall break your word through my fault  Beauchamp was affected Graciousness said he looking at Harriet and Goodness looking at Emily how are they here united What a happy man will he be who can intitle himself to a Lady formed upon such an example  A sunbeam from my brother's eye seemed to play upon his face and dazle his eyes The fine youth withdrew behind Lady W's chair Mr Selby who had been so good as to give us his silent attention then spoke with a twang through his nose Adad adad said he I don't know what to make of myselfBut go on go on I love to hear you  Your good Lord my dear enjoyed the pleasure we all had Mine tossed up his head and seemed to snuff the wind And yet my dear Lady L there was nothing so very extraordinary said but the  manner  was the thing which shewed a meaning that left language behind it  My brother is absolutely passive as to the oeconomy of the approaching solemnity Mrs Shirley Mrs Selby Lady W your Charlotte and Lucy are the council appointed but uncle Selby will put in to marshal this happy proceeding  What a pize  he says is not Harriet  his  daughter Will it not be his Day  Mrs Selby tries to smile off his oddity but nowandthen we see her goodnaturedly redden at it as if for his sake Lucy looks at her uncle as if she could hardly away with his particularities but Mrs Shirley has always something to say for him She enters into his character She knows the honesty as well as generosity of his heart That it all proceeds from joy and love and always allows for himAs I would have my friends allow for me And to say truth I for my own part like him the better for wanting allowances because his case in that respect is mine Ah my dear it is the thoughtful halfasleep halfawake blinking cat that catches the mouse Such as your Charlotte with their kittenish tricks do but fright away the prey and if they could catch it had rather play with it than kill it  Harriet is with her virgins Her dress is left to her own choice I stept in just nowShe met me at her dressingroom door and looked  so  lovely  so  silly and  so  full of unmeaning meaningness Do you understand me Lady L She sighedWhat would my Harriet say to me said I taking her handI don't know again sighedBut love me Lady GCan I help it said I and putting my arms about her kissed her cheek  Uncle Selby has provided seven gentlemen of the neighbourhood to match the number of the Ladies for there will be sixteen of us Mr  Godsrey  Mr  Steele  Mr  Falconbridge  three agreeable young men sons of gentlemen in the neighbourhood Mr Selby's chosen friends and companions in his fieldsports his cousin  Holles  brother to the Miss Holles's an admirer of Miss Nedham young Mr  Roberts  an admirer of Miss Barclay Mr  Allestree  a nephew of Sir John a young man of sine qualities engaged to Miss Dolly Nedham and Lord  Reresby  of Ireland related to Mr Selby's favourite Sir Thomas Falconbridge a young nobleman of shining parts great modesty goodnature and what is worth them all Mrs Shirley says a man of virtue  Lord W was very desirous of giving so rich a jewel as Harriet to his nephew in return as he said for  as  rich a jewel which he had presented to him but Mr Selby would not admit of that I told him on his appeal to me that he was right once in his life  Mr Selby talks much of the music he has provided for tomorrow He speaks of it as a  band  I assure you  WE have had a most agreeable evening My brother was the Soul of the company His address to his Harriet was respectfullyaffectionate yet for her sake not very peculiar Everybody in turn had his kindest notice and were happy in it The next day's solemnity was osten hinted at by Mr Selby and even by my flippant LordBut Sir Charles always insensibly led to more general subjects and this supported the spirits of the too thoughtful Harriet and she behaved on the whole very prettily His joy visibly was joy but it seemed to be joy of so familiar and easy a nature as if it would last  He once occasionally told the happy commencement  of his acquaintance with Miss Byron on purpose I saw to remind her that he ought not to be thought of as a stranger to her and to engage her in an easy familiarity But there was a delicacy observed by him in the remembered commencement He put it not from the time that he rescued her from Sir Hargrave but from the first visit she made me in St James's Square tho' she with great gratitude carried it back to its real commencement  Mrs Shirley retired soon as is her custom her Harriet attending her The old Lady is lame and infirm but as she sits is a very fine woman and everybody sees that she was once a beauty I thought I never saw beauty in full bloom so beautiful as when it supported beauty in ruins on the old Lady's retiring with a face  so  happy leaning one arm on her lovely grandchild a neat crutchstick in the other lightning her weight to the delicatelyformed supporter of her old age It was so striking a picture that every soul all standing up from reverence or her retreating observed it and no one knew which observed it first when the door shurt out the graceful figures  The old Lady's lameness is owing it seems to a sprained sinew got in leading up a dance not many years ago proposed by herself in order to crown the reconciliation which she had brought about between a couple that had till then been unhappy and which her goodnature and joy made her not sensible of till she sat down Pity pity that anything should have hurt so benign so chearful so benevolent a woman Why did not Harriet tell us this circumstance It would have heightened our value for her And the more if she had told us as is the truth that she never considers it as a hurt so honourably come by but when she thinks she is troublesome to those about her  Harriet returned to company more chearful than when she left it enriched with her grandmother's  blessings and prayers for her and my brother as she whispered me and in having been allowed to support the tottering parent  Harriet said I aloud you were a very naughty girl to accuse me as once you did of reflecting upon age You never in my eyes looked more lovely than you did half an hour ago supporting the best of old Ladies  We are of your Ladyship's mind said Lady W A new grace believe me my dear shone out in every graceful feature  Your kind notice Ladies bowing to me and Lady W does me honour but more to your own hearts  Most gracefully does the dear girl receive and return a compliment but this Lady L I need not now say to you We have both admired her on these occasions How happy will she make a man who can be so  sensible  of his happiness And how happy will  he  make  her He  who has the most grateful and enlarged of human hearts  Mr Deane Sir Charles Lord and Lady W Mrs Shirley Mr and Mrs Selby Lucy Lord L and I withdrew to read and see signed the Marriagearticles soon after tea I tell you things out of course Lady L as they come into my head When they were ready to sign the dear Harriet was sent for in She would not come before She begged she prayed she might not The first line of each clause and the last for form sake were run over by Mr Deane as fast as he could read How the dear creature trembled when she came in and all the time of the shortened reading But when the pen was given her to write her name she dropt it twice on the parchment Sir Charles saw her emotion with great concern and held her up as she stood My dearest life said he take time take timeDo not hurry putting the pen each time with reverence in her fingers She tried to write but twice her pen would not touch the  parchment so as to mark it She sat down Take time take time my Love repeated he She soon made another effort his arm round her waistShe then signed them but Sir Charles held her hand and the parchments in them when she delivered them  'As your act and deed my dearest Love'  said Sir Charles'Yes indeed' said the dear creature and made him a courtesy hardly knowing what she did  She must hear of this when she can bear it You charged me to be very minute on the behaviour of our Harriet You was sure it would be a pattern But no you see she is too timid  She accompanied me to my chamber when we retired for the night She signed I took notice of itO my Charlotte said she Tomorrow Tomorrow  Will be the beginning of your happiness my HarrietWhat virgin heart said I but must have had joy on her contemplating the man of sense and politeness had his behaviour of this night  only  been the test of her judgment of him  True And I  have  joy But the circumstance before me is a solemn one And does not the obligation lie all on his side  Does he behave to you my Love as if he thought  any  of it did  O no no But the fact is otherwise and as  I  know it the obligation is heightened by his polite goodness to me  Dearly does he love his Harriet Tomorrow will you be  his  Harriet for life Are you not convinced that he loves you  I am I am But  But what my dear  I never can deserve him Hapless hapless Clementina she  only  could Let a sortnight after tomorrow be over and she be not  un  happy and what a thrice happy creature shall I be  I kissed her glowing cheekSupport yourself like a heroine tomorrow my dear You  will  have a task because of the crouds which will attend you but it is the tax you pay for being so excellent and so much beloved  Is it not strange Lady G that my grandmamma should join to support my uncle in his vehemence for a public day Had it been only  his  command I would have rebelled  The pride they take in the alliance with my brother not for his situation in life but for his transcendent merit is their motive your grandmother's particularly She considers the day as one of the happiest of her life She has begged of me to support you in undergoing it She says If there should be a thousand spectators she knows it will give pleasure to as many hearts and to hers the more for that reason And you will be continued I so lovely a Pair when joined that every beholder man and woman will give him to you you to him  You are very good my dear Lady G to encourage me thus But I told my grandmother this night that she knew not the hardship she had imposed on me by insisting on a public day but I would not begin so great a change whatever it cost me by an act of opposition or disobedience to the will of so dear a parent But your  brother  my dear Lady G continued she who would have thought  he  would have given into it  As your friends mean a compliment to my brother replied I so he by his acquiescence means one to you and to them He is not a consident man He looks upon Marriage in as awful a light as you do but he is not shy of making a public declaration of his Love to the woman he has chosen He has told me talking of this very subject that a public ceremony is not what for your delicacysake he would have proposed But  being  proposed he would not by any means decline it He had no concern but for you  and he took your acquiescence as a noble instance of your duty and obligingness to one of the most affectionate and worthy of parents  O my dear Lady G how good was you to come down Support me in the arduous task of TomorrowYou will not want my support my love you will have Sir Charles Grandison bound both by Duty and Love to support you  She threw her arms about me I will endeavour to behave as I ought in a circumstance that shall intitle me to such protection and to such a Sister  My fidgeting Lord thrust in unsent for his sharp face and I chiding him for his intrusion she slipt away or I had designed to a tend her to her chamber and there perhaps should we have staid together most part of the night If I had I don't suppose that I should have deprived  her  of any rest What makes my foolish heart throb for her so happy as she is likely to beBut sincerely do I love her  I should have told you that Emily behaved very prettily Mr Beauchamp had a rich opportunity to engage her while the settlements were executing  On our return to them the poor girl was wiping her eyes How now Emily said I softly O madam Mr Beauchamp has been telling me how ill Sir Harry is His own eyes set mine the example How I pity him And how good he isNo wonder my Guardian loves him  Beauchamp may possibly catch her in a weeping fit The heart softened by grief will turn to a comforter Our own grief produces pity for another Pity Love They are next neighbours and will call in to ask kindly how a sufferer does And what a heart must that be that will not administer comfort when it makes a neigbourly call if comfort be in its power  'Lord G you are very impertinent'  I am in the scribbling vein my Caroline And here this man  'Say another word Lord G and I'll sit up all night  Well well now you return not sauciness for threatening I will have done'  Good nightGood morrow rather Lady LO Lady L  Good  morrow may it be  CH G  LETTER LII  Lady  G  Miss  SELBY  To Lady  L  THURSDAY  Morning Nov    YOU shall find me my dear Sister as minute as you wish Lucy is a charming girl For the humour's sake as well as to forward each other on the joyful occasion we shall write by turns  It would look as if we had determined upon a public day in the very face of it were we to appear in full dresses The contrary therefore was agreed upon yesterday But every one however intends to be dressed as elegantly as Morningdresses can make them Harriet as you shall hear is the least shewy All in Virgin white She looks she moves an Angel I must go to the dear girl  'Lucy where are you'  'Here madamBut how can one write when one's thoughts'  'Write as I bid you Have I not given you your cue'

part of the morning  We are each of us serenaded as I may say by direction of this joyful man uncle Selby  awakened  as he called it to music by James Selby playing at each person's door an air or two the words from an Epithalamium whose I know not  The Day is come you wished so long  Love picked it out among the throng  He destines to himself this Sun  And takes the reins and drives it on  It is indeed a fine day The sun seemed to reproach some of us but Harriet slept not a wink No wonder  I hastened up to salute her She was ready dressed Charming readiness my Love said I I took the opportunity while I was able answered she  Lucy Nancy were with her both dressed as she for the Day that they might have nothing to do but attend her What joy in their faces What sweet carefulness in the lovely Harriet'sAnd  will  this Day said she once in a low voice to me give me to the Lord of my HeartLet not  grief  come near it  joy  can be enough painful  Her grandmamma was soon ready Harriet hurried in to her grandmamma'a apartment to crave her blessing  LucyMy cousin her spirits overhurried was ready to saint in her grandmother's arms but revived by the soothings the blessings of her venerable parent soon recovered Let nobody be frighted said  her grandmother Affright not by your hurryings my lovely child A little fatigued her spirits are hurried Her joy is too much for them  What a charming presence of mind has Mrs Shirley Lady G bids me write anything to your Ladyship so I will but write and forbids me apologizing either for manner or words  Sir Charles was admitted She stood up the moment she saw him Love and Reverence in her sweet aspect With a kind impatience he hastened to her and threw himself at her feet taking her hand and pressing it with his lipsResume your magnanimity my dearest Life With the man before you by God's blessing you will have  more  than a chance for happiness  Forgive me Sir said she sitting down She could hardly stand I can have no doubt of your goodness But it is a great Day The Solemnity is an awful one  It is a great a solemn Day to  me  my dearest creature But encourage my joy by your smiles It can suffer abatement only by giving you pain  Generous goodness But  But what my LoveIn compliment to the best of Parents to the kindest of Uncles resume your usual presence of mind I else who shall glory before a thousand witnesses in receiving the honour of your hand shall be ready to regret that I acquiesced so chearfully with the wishes of those parental friends for a public celebration  I have not been of late well Sir My mind is weakened But it would be ungrateful If I did not own to you that my joy is as strong as my fear It overcame me I hope I shall behave better You should not have been called to be a witness of my weakness  This Day my dearest Love we call upon the world to witness to our mutual vows Let us shew that  world that our Hearts are one and that the Ceremony sacred as it is cannot make them more so The engagement is a holy one Let us shew the Multitude as well as our surrounding Friends that we think it a laudable one Once more I call upon you my dearest Life to justify my joy by your  apparent  approbation The world around you loveliest of women has been accustomed to see your  Lovers  shew them now the husband of your choice  O Sir you have given me a motive I will think of it throughout the whole Sacred Transaction She looked around her as if to see if everybody were ready that moment to attend her to Church  Lady G The Ceremony is happily over and I am retired to oblige my Caroline You have the form of the Procession When everthing was ready Mr Selby thought fit to call us down in order into the Great Hall according to it marshalling his Fours and great pride and pleasure did he take in his office At his first summons down came the Angel and the four young Ladies and each of the four had her partner assigned her  Emily seemed between the novelty and the parade to be wholly engaged  Harriet the moment she came down flew to her grandmamma and kneeled to her Sir Charles supporting her as she kneeled and as she arose A tender and sweet fight  The old Lady threw her arms about her and twice or thrice kissed her forehead her voice faltringGod bless bless sustain my childHer aunt kissing her cheek Now now my dearest Love whispered she I call upon you for fortitude  She visibly struggled for resolution but seemed in all her motions to be in a hurry as if afraid she should not hold it She passed me with such a sweet confusion Charming girl said I taking her hand  as she passed and giving way to her quick motions for fear restraint should disconcert her  When her uncle gave the word for moving and approached to take her hand she in her hurry forgetting her cue put it into Sir Charles's Hold hold said her uncle sweeping his bosom with his chin in his arch way that must not yet be My brother kissing her hand presented it in a very gallant manner to her uncle I yield it to you Sir said he as a precious trust in an hour's time to be confimred mine by Divine as well as human Sanctions  Mr Selby led the lovely creature to the coach but stopt at the door with her for Mrs Shirley's going in first The servants at distance all admiring and blessing and praying for their beloved young Lady  Sir Charles took the good Mrs Shirley's hand in one of his and put the other arm round her waist to support her What honour you do me Sir said she I think I may throw away  this  meaning her ebony crutchstick Do I ail anything Her feet however seconded not her spirits My brother lifted her into the coach It was so natural to him to be polite that he offered his hand to his beloved Harriet but was checked by her uncle in his usual pleasant manner Stay your time too ready Sir said he Thank God it will not be so long before  both  hands will be yours  We all followed very exactly the order that had been with so much proud parade prescribed by Earlmarshal Selby  The coachway was lined with spectators Mr Selby it seems bowed all the way in return to the salutes of his acquaintance Have you never Lady L called for the attention of your company in your coach to something that has passed in the streets or on the road and at the same time thrust your head through the windows so that nobody could see but yourself So it was with Mr Selby I doubt not  He wanted every one to look in at the Happy Pair but took care that hardly anybody but himself should be seen I asked him afterwards If it were not so He knew not he said but it might I told him he had a very jolly comely face to shew but no head He does not spare me But true jests are not always the most welcome Tell a Lady of Forty that she is Sixty or Seventy and she will not be so angry as if she were guessed to be Eight or Nineandthirty The one nobody will believe the other everybody My Lord G I can tell you fares well in Mr Selby's company  'Lucy my dear girl take the penYou don't know you say what I wrote lastRead it my girlYou have itTake the pen I want to be among them'  Lucy Lady G must have her jest whether in the right place or not Excuse me both Sisters How  could  she however in a part so interesting She says I must give an account of the Procession and she will conduct them into the Church I out of it I cannot she says after so many wishes so many suspenses so much expectation before it came to this be too minute Every woman's heart leaps she says when a Wedding is described and wishes to know all  how and about it  Your Ladyship will know that these words are Lady G's own But what can I say of the Procession  The poor HarrietFie upon meThe rich Harriet was not sorry I believe that her uncle's head now on this side now on the other in a manner filled the Coach but when it stopt at the Churchyard an inclosed one whose walls keep off coaches near a stone's throw from the Churchporch then was my lovely cousin put to it especially as her grandmother walked so slow We were all out of our Coaches before the Father and the Bride entered the  Porch I should tell your Ladyship that the passage from the entrance of the Churchyard to the Church is railed in Every Sunday the croud gathered to see the gentry go in and come out are accustomed to be bounded by these rails and were the more contentedly so now The whole Churchyard seemed one mass but for that separating passage of living matter distinguished only by separate heads not a hat on the mens pulled off perhaps by general consent for the convenience of seeing more than from designed regard in  that  particular But in the main never was there such silent respect shewn on the like occasion by mortal mob We all of us Lady L have the happiness of being beloved by high and low  But one pretty spectacle it is impossible to pass by Four girls tenants daughters the eldest not above Thirteen appeared with neat wickerbaskets in their hands filled with flowers of the season Chearful way was made for them As soon as the Bride and Father and Sir Charles and Mrs Shirley alighted these pretty little Flora's all dressed in white chaplets of flowers for headdresses large nosegays in their bosoms white ribbands adorning their stays and their baskets some streaming down others tied round the handles in truelover's knots attended the company two going before two other here and there and everywhere all strewing flowers A pretty thought of the tenants among themselves Sir Charles seemed much pleased with them Pretty dears he called them to one of them  God  bless you and  God  bless you was echoed from many mouths Your brother's attention was chiefly employed on Mrs Shirley because of her age and lameness Here my good Lady G perhaps would stop to remark upon the worthy nature of the English populace when good characters attract their admiration for even the populace took notice how right a thing it was for the finest young Gentleman their eyes  ever beheld to take such care of so good an old Lady He  deserved  to live to be old himself one said They would warrant others said that he was a sweettemper'd man and others that he had a good heart In the Procession one of us picked up one praise another another Tho' Lady G Lady W and the four Bridemaids as well as the Lords might have claimed high notice yet not any of them received more than commendation We were all considered but as Satellites to the Planetr that passed before us What indeed were more But let me say that Mrs Shirley had her share in Reverence as the lovely Couple had theirs in Admiration But O how my dear cousin was affected when she alighted from her uncle's coach  The Churchwardens themselves were so complaisant as to stand at the Churchdoor and opened it on the approach of the Bride and her Nuptial Father But all the pews near the Altar were however filled one or two excepted which seemed to be left for the company with Ladies and welldressed women of the neighbourhood And tho' they seemed to intend to shut the doors after we had all got in the Church was full of people Mr Selby was displeased for his Niece's sake who trembling could hardly walk up to the Altar Sir Charles seated  his  venerable charge on a covered bench on the leftside of the Altar and by her and on another covered bench on the rightside without the rails we all but the Bridemaids and their partners took our seats They stood the Men on the Bridegroom's side the Maids on Harriet'sNever  Lady G  'Are you within the Church LucyYou are I protest Let me read what you have done Come pretty well pretty wellYou were going to praise my brother Leave that to me I have an excellent knack at it'  Never was man so much and so deservedly admired He saw his Harriet wanted support and encouragement The Minister stood suspended a few moments as doubting whether she would not faint My dearest Love whispered Sir Charles remember you are doing honour to the happy thrice happy man of your Choice Shew he is your Choice in the face of this Congregation Pardon me Sir I will endeavour to be all you wish me  Sir Charles bowed to the Minister to begin the Sacred Office Mr Selby with all his bravery trembled and overcome by the Solemnity of the Preparation looked now pale now red The whole Congregation were hushed and silent as if nobody were in the Church but persons immediately concerned to be there Emily changed colour frequently She had her handkerchief in her hand and pretty enough her sister Bridemaids little thinking that Emily had a reason for her emotion which none of them had pulled out  their  handkerchiefs too and  permitted  a gentle tear or two to steal down their glowing cheeks I fixed my eye on Emily sitting outward to keep her in order The Doctor began  '  Dearly Beloved  '  Ah Harriet thought I thou art much quieter now than once thou wert at these words  When Sir Hargrave Pollexfen would have compelled her to be his Vol I p    No  impediments  were confessed by either of the parties when they were referred to by the Minister on this head I suppose this reference would have been omitted by Sir Hargrave's snuffling Parson To the question to my brother  '  Wilt thou have  '  c he chearfully answered  I will  Harriet did not say  I will not  'Who giveth this woman  c I I I said uncle Selby and he owns that he had much ado to refrain saying  'With all my heart and soul'  Sir Charles seemed to have the office  by  heart Harriet  in  her heart For before the Minister could take the  Righthand of the good girl to put it into that of my brother his had knew its office nor did her trembling hand decline the favour Then followed the words of acceptance  'I Charles take thee Harriet  '  c on  his  part which he audibly and with apparent joy and reverence in his countenance repeated after the Minister But not quite so alert was Harriet in  her  turn Her hand was rather taken than offered Her lips however moved after the Minister nor seemed to hesitate at the little piddling word  obey  which I remember gave a qualm to my poor heart on the like occasion The Ring was presented The Doctor gave it to Sir Charles who with his usual grace put it on the singer of the most charming woman in England repeating after the Minister audibly  '  With this Ring I thee wed  '  c She brightened up when the Minister joining their Righthands read  'Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder'  And the Minister's address to the company declaring the Marriage and pronouncing them Man and Wife in the name of the Holy Trinity and his blessing them swelled she owns her grateful heart ready to bursting In the Responses I could not but observe that the Congregation generally joined as if they were interested in the celebration  Sir Charles with a joy that lighted up a more charming flush than usual on his face his lively Soul looking out at his fine eyes yet with an air as modest as respectful did credit to our Sex before the applauding multitude by bending his knee to his sweet Bride on taking her Hand and saluting her on the conclusion of the ceremonyMay God my dearest Life said he audibly be gracious to  your  Grandison as he will be good to  his  Harriet now no more ByronShe courtesied low and with so modest a grace that every soul blessed her and pronounced her the loveliest of women and him the most graceful and polite of men  He invited Dr Curtis to the Weddingdinner and led his Bride into the Vestry where already were her grandmother her aunt Lady W her Lord mine and Lord L She was followed by her Virgin train they by their partners She threw herself the moment she beheld her grandmother at her feet Bless bless madam your happy happy Child  God for ever bless the Darling of my heart  Sir Charles bent his knee to the venerable Lady with such a  condescending  dignity if I may so express myself Receive and bless also your Son my Harriet's reverend parent and mine  The dear Lady was affected She slid off her seat on her knees and with uplifted hands and eyes tears trickling on her cheeks Thou Almighty bless the dear Son of my wishes  He raised her with pious tenderness and saluted her Excellent LadyHe would have said more but was affectedEverybody wasAnd having seated the old Lady he turned to Mrs SelbyWords are poor said he my actions my behaviour shall speak the grateful sense I have of your goodness saluting her of yours madam to Mrs Shirley and of yours my dearest Life addressing himself to his lovely Bride who seemed hardly able to sustain her joy on so respectful a recognition of relation to persons so dear to her Let me once more added he bless the Hand that has blessed me  She chearfully offered it I give you Sir my Hand said she courtesying and with it a poor HeartA poor Heart indeed But it is a grateful one It is all your own  He bowed upon her Hand He spoke not He seemed as if he could not speak  Joy Joy Joy was wished the Happy Pair from every mouth See my dear young Ladies' said the happy and instructing Mr Shirley addressing herself to them  'the Reward of Duty Virtue and Obedience  How unhappy must those Parents and Relations be whose Daughters unlike our Harriet have disgraced themselves and their families by a a shameful ChoiceAs my Harriet's  is  such looking around her be  your  Lot my amiable Daughters  They every one besought her Hand and kissed it and some by speech all by looks and courtesies promised to cherish the memory of this happy transaction for their benefit  Emily when she approached the venerable Lady sobbing said Bless me me also bless my dear grandmamma ShirleyLet me be your own GranddaughterShe embraced and blessed the dear girlAh my Love said she But  will  you supply the place of my Harriet to me  Will  you be my Harriet  Will  you live with me and Mrs Selbyas Harriet didEmily started Ah madam you are all goodness Let me try to make myself in some little way agreeable to my dear Miss Byron that was and live a little while in the sunshine of my Guardian's eye and then how proud shall I be to be thought in any the least degree like your Harriet  This I thought a good hint of Mrs Shirley Our Harriet my dear Caroline shall not be made unhappy by the chit nor shall the dear girl neither if I can help it be made so by her own foible We will watch over both for the good of both and for the tranquillity of the best of men  Beauchamp's joy shone through a cloud because of his Father's illness but it  did  shine  Mr Selby and my Lord were vastly alive Lord L was fervent in his joy and congratulations but he was wiser than both put together Nothing was wanting to shew that he was excessively pleased but I was afraid the other two would not have considered the Vestry as part of the Church and would have struck up a tune without music  How sincerely joyful also were Lord and Lady W▪  My Lord's eyes burst into tears more than once Nephew and dear Nephew at every word whether speaking of or to my brother as if he thought the Relation he stood in to him a greater glory than his Peerage or aught else that he valued himself upon his excellent Lady excepted  Upon my Honour Caroline I think as I have often said that people may be  very  happy if not  most  happy who set out with a moderate stock of Love and supply what they want in that with Prudence I really think that my Brother and Harriet cannot be happier than are this now worthy Couple times of life considered on both sides and my Lord's inferior capacity allowed for For certainly men of sense are most capable of joyful sensations and have their balances since it is  as  certain that they are also most susceptible of painful ones What then is the stuff the nonsense that romantic girls their romancing part of life not wholly elapsed prate about and din one's ears with of  first  Love  first  Flame but  first  Folly Do not most of such give indication of gunpowder constitutions that want but the match to be applied to set them into a blaze Souls of tinder discretions of flimsy gauze that conceal not their follyOne day they will think as I do and perhaps before they have daughters who will  convince  them of the truth of my assertion  But here comes Lucy  'My dear girl take the penI am too  sentimental  The French only are proud of sentiments at this day the English cannot bear them Story story story is what they hunt after whether sense or nonsense probable or improbable'  Lucy  'Bless me Lady G you have written a great deal in a little What am I to do  Lady G You brought the Happy Pair into Church I have told Lady L what was done there You are to carry them out  Lucy  'And so I will'  My dearest Love said her charming man to my cousin who had a little panic on the thought of going back through so great a croud imagine as you walk that you see nobody but the happy man whom you have honoured with your Hand Everybody will praise and admire the loveliest of women Nobody I hope will blame your Choice Remember at whose request it was that you are put upon this difficulty Your Grandmamma's and Uncle's She one of the best of women was so married to one the best of men I was but acquiescent in it Shew my dearest Life all your numerous admirers and wellwishers that you are not ashamed of your Choice  O Sir how charmingly do you strengthen my mind I will shew the world that my Choice is my Glory  Everybody being ready she gave her Hand to the Beloved of her Heart  The Bells were set a ringing the moment the Solemnity was concluded and Sir Charles Grandison the Son of our venerable Mrs Shirley the Nephew of my uncle and aunt Selby Husband of my dear and everdear Harriet and the Esteemed of every heart led his graceful Bride through a lane of applauding and decent behaving spectators down through the Churchand still more thronging multitudes in the Churchyard the four little Flora's again strewing flowers at their feet as they passed My sweet girls said he to two of them I charge you complete the honour you have done us by your presence at Selbyhouse You will bring your companions with you my Loves  My uncle looked around him as he led Mrs Shirley  So  proud and  so  stately By some undesigned change Mr Beauchamp led Miss Jervois She seemed pleased and happy for he whispered to her all the  way praises of her Guardian  My  Guardian twice or thrice occasionally reported she aloud as if she boasted of standing in some relation to him  The Bride and Bridegroom stopt for Mrs Shirley a little while at the Coachside A very grateful accident to the spectators He led them both in with a politeness that attends him in all he does The Coach wheeled off to give way to the next and we came back in the order we went  'Now my dear Lady G you who never were from the side of your dear new sister for the rest of the day resume the pen'  Lady G  'I will my dear but in a new Letter This fourth sheet is written down to the very edge Caroline will be impatient I will send away this'  Joy to my Sister Joy to my Aunt Joy to the Earl To Lady Gertrude To our dear Dr Bartlett To every one on an event so happy and so long wished for by us All  'Sign Lucy sign'  'After your Ladyship'  There then  CHARLOTTE G  And  There then  LUCY SELBY  LETTER LIII  Lady  G  To Lady  L  In Continuation  THIS happy event has been so long wisned for by us all were so much delighted with the Bride as well as the Bridegroom so many uncertainties so many suspenses have fallen in so little likelihood once that it ever would have been and you are so miserably tied by the leg poor Caroline and so little to divert you besides the once smiling to the ten times squalling of your little stranger that Compassion Love both incite me to be minute that so you may  be as much with us in idea as we all wished you could have been in person  Crouds of people lined the way in our return from Church as well as in our way to it and blessings were pronounced upon the Happy Pair by hundreds at their alighting at Selbyhouse  When we were all assembled in the Great Hall mutual congratulations flowed from every mouth Then did every man salute the happy happy Bride Then did the equallyhappy Bridegroom salute every LadyThere was among us the height of joy joy becoming the awful Solemnity and every one was full of the decency and delight which were given and shewn by the crouds of spectators of all ranks and both Sexes a delight and decency worthy of the characters of the admirable Pair And Miss Nedham declared and all the young Ladies joined with her that if she could be secure of the like good behaviour and encouragement she would never think of a Private Wedding for herself Mr Selby himself was overjoyed too much even to utter a jest Now now he said he had attained the height of his ambition  The dear Harriet  could  look up She  could  smile around her I led her with Lucy into the CedarparlourNow my dear Love said I the moment we entered it throwing my arms about her just as her lips were joyfully opening to speak to me do I salute my real Sister my Sister Grandison in my dear Lady L's name as well as in my own God Almighty confirm and establish your happiness  My dearest dearest Lady G how grateful how encouraging to my heart is your kind Salutation Your continued Love and that of my dear Lady L will be essential to my happiness  May our Hearts be ever united replied I But they must For were not our Minds kindred Minds before  But you must love my Lucy said she presenting  her to meYou must love my GrandMamma said I catching the word from her your Aunt your Uncle your Cousins and your Cousins Cousins to the twentieth GenerationAnd so I will Ours yours Yours ours We are all of one Family and will be for ever  What a happy creature am I replied sheHow many people can  one  good man make soBut where where is my Emily sweet girl Bring to me  Lucy  bring to me my Emily  Lucy went out and led in the sweet girl With hands and eyes uplifted My dear Miss Byron that was now Lady Grandison said she love me love your Emily I am now  your  Emily  your  Ward love me as well as you did when Miss Byron  Harriet threw her arms about her neck I do I will I must You shall be my Sister my Friend  my  Emily now indeed Love me as I will love you and you shall find  your  happiness in  mine  Sir Charles entred his Beauchamp in his hand Quitting his and taking hers he kissed it Once more said he do I thank my dearest Life for the honour she has done me Then resuming with his other hand his Beauchamp's he presented each to the other as Brother and Sister  Beauchamp in a graceful manner bowed on her hand She courtefied to him with an air of dignity and esteem  He then turning to Emily Acknowlege my dear said he your elder Sister My Harriet will love her Emily Receive my dearest Life your Ward Yet to Emily I acquit not myself of the power any more than of the will of obliging you at first hand  O Sir said the sobbing girl you are all goodness But I will make no request to you but through my dearest Lady Grandison's mediation If she approve of it first I shall not doubt of its fitness to be complied with  Was not that pretty in EmilyO how Beauchamp's eyes loved her  But why Ladies said Sir Charles do you sequester yourselves from the company Are we not all of a Family today The four little Flora's with their baskets in their hands were entering the gate as I came in Receive them my Love with your usual graciousness We will join the company and call them in My Beauchamp you are a Brideman restore my Bride to her friends and admirers within  He took Emily's hand She looked  so  proudHarriet gave hers to Beauchamp We followed them into the Great Hall Mr Selby had archness in his look and seemed ready to blame us for withdrawingSir Charles was aware of him My dear Mr Selby said he Will you not allow us to see the pretty Flora'sBy all means said Mr Selby and hurried out and introduced them Sweet pretty girls We had more leisure to consider the elegant rusticity of their dresses and appearance They had their baskets in their hands and a courtesy and a blush ready for every one in company Sir Charles seemed to expect that his Bride would take notice of them first but observing that she wanted presence of mind he stept to them took each by the hand the youngest first called them pretty Loves I wish said he I could present you with as pretty flowers as you threw away in honour  to this company  putting into each basket wrapped up in paper five guineas Then presented them two in each hand to his Bride who by that time was better prepared to receive them with that sweet ease and familiarity which give grace to all she says and does  The children afterwards desiring to go to their parents the polite Beauchamp him elf accompanied by Lucy led them to them and returned with a request from all the tenants that they might have the honour some time in the day to see the Bride and Bridegroom  among them were it but for two minutes What says my Love said Sir Charles O Sir I cannot cannotWell then I will attend them to make your excuse as well as I can She bowed her thanks  The time before dinner was devoted to conversation Sir Charles was nobody's no not very particularly his Bride's He put every one upon speaking in turn For about half an hour he sat between the joyful Mrs Shirley and Mrs Selby but even then in talking to them talked to the whole company Yet in his air and manner to both shewed so much respect as needed not the aid of a particular address to them in words  This was observed to me by good Lord L For Harriet uneasy every eye continually upon her thoughtful bashful withdrawing a little before dinner with a cast of her eye to me I followed her to her dressingroom There with so much expressiveness of meaning tho' not of language so much tenderness of love so much pious gratitude so much true virgin sensibility did she open her heart to me that I shall ever revolve what passed in that conversation as the true criterion of Virgin Delicacy unmingled with Affectation Nor was I displeased that in the height of her grateful Selfcongratulation she more than once acknowleged a sigh for the admirable Clementina We just began to express our pleasure and our hopes in the good behaviour of our Emily when we were called to dinner  It was a sumptuous one  Mr Selby was very orderly upon the whole But he remembred he said that when  he  was married and he called upon his Dame to confirm it he was obliged to wait on his Bride and the Company and he insisted upon it that Sir Charles should  No no no every one said and the Bride looked a little serious upon it But Sir Charles with an air  of gaiety that infinitely became him took a napkin from the butler and putting it under his arm I have only one request to make you my dear Mr SelbyWhen I am more aukward than I ought to be do you correct me and I shall have both pride and pleasure in the task  Adad said Mr Selby looking at him with pleasureYou may  be  anything  do  anything you cannot conceal the Gentleman Adsheart you must always be the first man in companyPardon me my Lords  Sir Charles was the modestest servitor that ever waited at table while his napkin was under his arm But he laid it down While he addressed himself to the company finding something to say to each in his pithy agreeable manner as he went round the table He made every one happy With what delight did the elder Ladies look upon him when he addressed himself to each of them He stopt at the Bride's chair and made her a compliment with an air of tenderness I heard not what it was sitting at distance but she looked grateful pleased smiled and blushed He passed from her to the Bridemaids and again complimented each of them They also seemed delighted with what he said Then going to Mr Selby Why don't you bid me resume the napkin SirNo no we see what you can do Your conformity is enough for me You may now sit down when you please You make the waiters look aukward  He took his seat thanked Mr Selby for having reminded him of his duty as he called it and was all Himself the most graceful and obliging of men  You know my dear Lady L how much I love to praise my brother Neither I nor the young Ladies not even those who had humble servants present regarded anybody but him My poor LordI am glad however that he has a tolerable good set of  teethThey were always visible A good honest sort of man tho' Lady L whatever you may think of him  After dinner at Mr Selby's reminding motion Sir Charles and the men went to the tenants They all wished him joy and as they would not sit down while he stood Sir Charles took a seat among them and all the rest followed his example  One of the honest men it seems remembred the Nuptials of Mr and Mrs Byron and praised them as the best and happiest of the human race Others confirmed  his  character of both Another knew the late Mr Shirley and extolled him as much Another remembred the birth another the christening of the Bride and others talked of what an excellent creature she was from her infancy Let me tell you Sir said one greyheaded man you will have much ado to deserve her and yet you are said to be as good as you are handsome The women took up the cause They were sure by what they had heard if any man in the world could deserve the Bride it was Sir Charles Grandison and they would swear for him by his looks One of the honest men said they should all have taken it as an  hugeous  favour were they allowed to wish the Bride joy tho' at ever so great a  distance  Sir Charles said He was sure the women would excuse her this day and then the men would in complaisance to them We will hope said he looking all round him before we leave Northamptonshire for one happy dinner together  They all got up to bow and courtesy and looked upon each other and the men who are most of them freeholders wished to the Lord for a new election and that he would come among them They had no great matter of fault to find they said with their present representatives but anybody who would oppose Sir Charles Grandison would stand no chance The women joined in the declaration as if  they thought highly as Sir Charles pleasantly observed of their own influence over their husbands They all wondered that he was not in Parliament till they heard how little a while he had been in England  He took leave of the good people who by their behaviour and appearance did as much credit to their landlords as to themselves with his usual affability and politeness repeating his promise of a day of Jubilee as some of them called it  The Ball at the request of the whole company was opened by the Bride and Bridegroom She was very uneasy at the general Call Sir Charles saw she was and would have taken out Miss Nedham but it was not permitted the dear creature I believe did her best at the time but I have seen her perform better Yet she did exceedingly well But such a figure herself and such a partner How could she do amiss  Emily was taken out by Beauchamp He did his best I am sure and almost as much excelled his pretty partner as his beloved friend did his  Emily sitting down by me asked if she did not perform very ill Not  very  ill my dear said I but not so well as I have seen you dance I don't know said she what ails me My heart is very heavy madam What can be the meaning of it But don't tell Lady Grandison soHighhoLady Grandison What a sound is that A charming sound But how shall I bring my lips to be familiarized to it  You are glad she is married my love I dare say  Glad To be sure I am It is an event that I have long long wished for But new names and new titles one knows not how to frame one's mouth to presently It was some time before I could call you  Lady G But don't you pity poor Lady Clementina a little madam  A great deal I do But as she refused my brother  Ah dear that's the thing I wonder she couldwhen he would have let her have the free exercise of her Religion  Had you rather your Guardian had had Lady Clementina Emily  O no How can you ask me such a question madam Of all the women in the world I wished him to have Miss Byron But she is too happy for pity you know madamBless me What does she look so thoughtful for Why does she sigh so Surely she can't be sorry  Sorry No my Love But a change of condition for life New attachments A new course of life Her name sunk and lost The property person and will of another excellent as the man is obliged to go to a new house to be ingrafted into a new family to leave her own who so dearly love her an  irrevocable  destinyDo you think Emily new in her present circumstances every eye upon her it is not enough to make a considerate mind as hers is thoughtful  All these are mighty hardships madam putting up her lipBut Lady G can you suppose she thinks them so If she  does  But she is a dear good LadyI shall ever love her She is an ornament of our Sex See how lovely she looks Did your Ladyship ever see so sweet a creature I never did  Not for Beauty Dignity Ease Figure Modesty good Sense did I ever  She is my  Guardianess  may I say Is there such a wordI shall be as proud of her as I am of my Guardian Yet there is no cause of sighing I thinkSee my Guardian her Husband Unfashionable  as the word is it is a pretty word The  Houseband  that ties all together Is not  that  the meaningLook round How does he surpass all men  His  Ease talk of Ease  His  Dignity talk of Dignity As handsome a man as she is a woman See how every young Lady eyes him every young Gentleman endeavours to imitate him I wish  he  would take me out I would do better  This was the substance of the whispering Dialogue that passed between Emily and mePoor girl  Mr Selby danced with Lucy and got great applause He was resolved he said to have one dance with the Bride She besought him not to think of it Her grandmamma her aunt intreated for her She desired Sir Charles to interposeIf my dearest Life you  could  oblige your uncleI cannot cannot think of it said she  Lady G said Sir Charles be so good as to challenge Mr Selby I stood forth and offered my hand to him He could not refuse it He did not perform so well as he did with Lucy Go said I when we had d ne sit down by your Dame and be quiet You have lost all your credit  You  dance with a BrideSome people know not how to bear applause nor to leave off when they are well Lord L took out Mrs Selby She dances very gracefully My Lord you know is above praise The young Lord Reresby and Miss Nedham distinguished themselves  My  odd creature was in his element He and Miss Barclay and another time he and Emily did very handsomely and the girl got up her reputation Lord W did hobble and not ungracefully with old Mrs Selby who had not danced she said for twenty years before but on so joyful an occasion would not refuse Lord W's challenge And both were applauded the time of life of the Lady the limpingness of my Lord considered  There was a very plentiful sideboard of rich wines sweetmeats c We all disclaimed formal supper  We went afterwards into country dances Mrs Shirley retired about Ten Harriet took the opportunity of attending her and it was a seasonable relief to her I had an intimation to attend her I found her just dropt on her knees to her grandmamma who with her arms about her neck was folding to her fond heart the darling of it The sweet girl was  so  apprehensive I was called upon to give my opinion whether she should return to the company or not I gave it that she should and that she should only retire for the night about Eleven As to the Bridemaids I said I would manage that they should only attend her to her chamber and leave her there with her aunt Lucy and me Lord L undertook to make the gentlemen give up form which he said they would the more easily do as they were set into dancing  After all Lady L we women dressed out in ribbands and gaudy trappings and in Virginwhite on our Weddingdays seem but like milkwhite heifers led to sacrifice We ought to be indulged if we are not shameless things and very wrong indeed in our choice of the man we  can  love  We returned to company The Bridegroom was looking out for us My dearest Life said he Are you returnedI thoughtThere he stopt  Mr Selby broke from his partner Miss Barclay to whisk into the figure the Bride Sir Charles joined the deserted Lady who seemed much better pleased with her new partner than with her old one Lord W who was sitting down took Mrs Selby and led her into the dance  I drew Miss Nedham to the sideboard and gave her her cue She gave theirs to the three other Bridemaids  About Eleven Mrs Selby unobserved withdrew with the Bride The Bridemaids one by one waited on her to her chamber saluted her and returned to company  The dear creature wanted presence of mind She fell into my reflexion above O my dear Lady G said she was I not right when I declared that I never would marry were it not to the man I loved above all the men in the world  She complimented me twenty times with being very good She prayed for me but her prayers were meant for herself You remember that she told me on my apprehensiveness on the like occasion that fear made me loving to her On her blessing me Ah Harriet said I you now find that apprehension will make one  pious  as well as  loving  My Sister my Friend my own my Caroline's my Brother's  dear  Lady Grandison said I when I left her near undressed God bless you And God be praised that I can call you by these tender names My Brother is the happiest of men You of women May we never love each other less than we do now Look forward to the serene happiness of your future lot If you are the Joy of our Brother you must be our Joy and the Jewel of our Family  She answered me only by a fervent embrace her eyes lifted up surcharged as I may say with tears of joy as in thankfulness  I then rushed downstairs and into the company  My brother instantly addressed meMy Harriet whispered he with impatience returns not this night  You will see Mrs Selby I presume byandby returned I  He took his seat by old Mrs Selby and fell into talk with her to avoid joining in the dances His eye was continually turned to the door Mrs Selby  at last came in Her eyes shewed the tender leave she had taken of her Harriet  My brother approached her She went out He followed her In a quarter of an hour she returned  We saw my brother no more that night  We continued our dancings till between Three and Four  I have often observed that we women whether weakly or robust are hardly ever tired with dancing It was so with us The men poor souls looked silly and sleepy by two all but my ape He has a good many  Femalities  as uncle Selby calls them But he was brought up to be idle and useless as women generally are I  must  conclude my Letters whimsically my dear If I did not you would not know them to be written by  Your  CHARLOTTE G  LETTER LIV  Lady  G  In Continuation  EMILY Lucy and I went to pay our morningcongratulations as soon as we arose which was not very early to my brother being told that he was in the Cedar parlour writing He received us like himself I am writing said he a few very short Letters They are to demand the felicitations one of our beloved Caroline one of our aunt Grandison one of the Earl of G and one of our dear Dr Bartlett There is another you may read it Charlotte  That also was a short one to signify according to promise as I found to Signor Jeronymo della Porretta the actual celebration of his Nuptials I returned it  'Like my brother'  was all I said It concluded with a caution given in the most ardent  terms against precipitating the admirable Clementina  We went up to the Bride She was dressing Her aunt was with her and her two cousin Holles's who went not home the preceding night  The moment we entered she ran to us and clasping her arms about my neck hid her blushing face in my bosomMy dearest dearest Lady G murmured sheAm I indeed your Sister your Sister Grandison And will you love me as well as ever  My dearest lovely Sister My own Sister Grandison My Brother's Wife Most sincerely do I repeat Joy Joy Joy to my Harriet  O Lady G How you raise me Your goodness is a seasonable goodness to me I never never but by yours and your sister's example shall be worthy of your brother  Then disengaging herself from my arms Yesterday Lucy said she was a happy happy Day I have but one one regretThere is a Lady in the world that deserves the best of men better than your HarrietAnd lifting up her hands and eyes God preserve and protect herShe shall be the subject of my prayers as often as I pray for myself and for him who is dearer to me than myself  Then embracing Emily Wish me Joy my Love In  my  Joy shall you find  your own  Emily wept and even sobbedYou must you must treat me less kindly madam I cannot cannot bear your goodyour goodness On my knees I acknowlege my other Guardian God bless my dear dear Lady Grandison  At that moment as they were folded in each other's arms entered my brotherHe clasped his round his sweet Bride pardon this intrusion said heExcellent creature continue to love my EmilyContinue my dear Emily to deserve the sisterly love of my Harriet  Then turning to me saluting me My Charlotte loves my Harriet so does our Caroline She fondly loves you both God continue your love to each other What Sisters has Yesterday's happy event given to each otherWhat a Wife to meWe will endeavour my Love to her to  deserve  our happiness and I humbly trust it will be continued to us  He saluted Mrs SelbyMy own Aunt Selby What obligations am I under to you and to our venerable Mrs Shirley for giving to an Angel an Angel's education and conferring on  me  the blessing  Congratulate me my dear Cousin Holles's saluting each May you both be as happy whenever you alter your single state as I will endeavour to make your lovely Cousin  He withdrew bowing to us and with so much respectfulness to the happy Harriet as delighted us all  Lucy went down with him to pay her morning compliments to the two Grandmamma's  Sister said Kitty Holles after he was gonewe never never can think of marrying after we have seen Sir Charles Grandison and his behaviour  Lucy came up with Nancy They embraced their cousin Your grandmamma and my grandmamma my dearest cousin are impatient to see you in  your  grandmamma's chamber and the gentlemen are crying out for their breakfasts in the great parlour We hurried down The Bride threw herself at her grandmamma's feet for her blessing It was given in such a tender and pious manner that we were all affected by it The best of Sons of Men said she afterwards has but just left me What a blessing to all around him is a good man Sir Charles Grandison is everything But my dear Loves to the younger Ladies Let a good man let life let manners be the principal motive of your choice In  goodness  will you have every sanction and your Fathers Mothers Relations  Friends every joy My dearest Love my Harriet taking her hand there was a time that I thought no man on earth could deserve you Now it is my prayer and will be that you may deserve this man But let us join the gentlemen Fear not my HarrietSir Charles's character will preserve with every one its dignity and give a sanction to the solemnity that has united you to him My dearest Love be proud and look assured  You  may or who can Yesterday's transaction is your Glory glory in it my Harriet  We attended the two elder Ladies down Harriet as bashful people ever do increased her own difficulties by staying behind with her Lucy We were all seated at the breakfasttables and staid for them Mr Selby grew impatient every one having declared themselves ready for breakfast At last down came the blushing Bride with her Lucy Sir Charles seeing Mr Selby's countenance turning peevishly arch just as he had begun  'Let me tell you Niece'  and was coming out with something he arose and taking his Bride's hand led her to her seat Hush my dear Mr Selby said he Nobody must call to account my Wise and I presentHow Sir How Sir Already have I lost my Niece  Not so Mr Selby All her duties will have strength given them by the happy event of yesterday But you must not let a newmarried man see how much easier it is to find fault than to be faultless  Your servant Sir replied Mr SelbyYou'll one day pay for your complaisance or my Niece is not a woman But I was ready primed You have robbed me of a jest and that let me tell you would have been more to me than my breakfast  After breakfast Lucy gave us a lesson on the harpsichord Sir Charles accompanied her finger at the desire of the company  Lord and Lady W excused themselves to breakfast  but came to dinner We entertained one another with reports of what passed yesterday what people said how the tenants feast was managed how the populace behaved at the houses which were kept open The Churchwardens List was produced of the Poor recommended by them It amounted to upwards of divided into two classes one of the acknowleged poor the other of poor housekeepers and labouring people who were ashamed to apply but to whom the Churchwardens knew bounty would be acceptable There were above thirty of these to whom Sir Charles gave very handsomely but we knew not what The Churchwardens who are known to be good men went away blessing him with hearts running over at their lips as if they themselves were to find their account in his goodness  Saturday  WE have had a smart debate this morning on the natural independency of our Sex and the usurpation of the other Particulars byandby  My brother is an irresistable man Tomorrow he has carried it to make his appearance at Church against all their first intentions and that by their own consents He had considered everything They had not Mr Beauchamp has Letters which require him to go up to town Lord and Lady W are desirous to get thither my Lord having some gouty warnings I am obliged to go up having hated to set about anything preparatory to your case Caroline If the wretch were to come in my way just now I should throw my standish at him I believe The Earl and Lady Gertrude are in town and I am afraid of another reprimand The Earl never jests but he means the same as if he were serious I shall take Emily with me when I go Mrs Reeves wants to be with her little boy Yet all these people are desirous to credit the appearanceI had like to have forgot your good manHe longs to see his Caroline  and hopes to engage my brother to stand in person as his urchin's sponsor So you see that there is a necessity to consent to make the appearance tomorrow or the Bride will lose the flower of her company  On Monday it stands determined that Mr and Mrs Reeves Mr Beauchamp Emily Lord L Lord and Lady W myself and Lord G will set out for London  God continue the happiness of this charming Pair Their behaviour to each other is just what I would wish it to be tender affectionate without fulsome fondness He cannot be more respectful to the dear creature now than he was before marriage But from his present behaviour I dare answer for him that he will not be less so And yet he is so lively that he has all the  young man  in his behaviour whenever occasions call for relaxation even when subjects require seriousness as they do sometimes in conversations between Mrs Shirley Mrs Selby Mr Deane and him his seriousness as Mrs Shirley herself finely observed in his absence is attended with such vivacity and intermingled with such entertaining illustrations all naturally arising from and falling into the subject that he is sure of every one's attention and admiration The features of his manly face and the turn of his fine eye observed she on another occasion are  cast  for pity and not for censure And let me add a speech of his when he was called upon to censure a person on a slight representation of facts  'The whole matter is not before us said he We know not what motives he may have to plead by way of extenuation tho' he may not be able entirely to excuse himself But as it appears to me I would not have done so'  But what my dear am I about Are they not my brother's praises that I am expatiating upon Was I ever to be trusted with that subject Is there no man I have been asked that is like your brotherHe I have answered is most likely to resemble him who  has an unbounded charity and universal benevolence to men of all professions and who imitating the Divinity regards the heart rather than the head and much more than either rank or fortune tho' it were princely and yet is not a leveller but thinks that rank or degree intitles a man who is not utterly unworthy of both to respect  I will write one more Letter and then give way to other affairs I never thought I should have been such a scribbler But the correspondence between my Brother and Dr Bartlett into which we were all so eager to peep that of this dear creature with her Lucy which so much entertained us and which led us in her absence to wish to continue the series of it the story of Clementina so interesting all our suspenses so affecting and the state of this our lovely friend's heart so peculiar and the task removed from you to me of promoting and contributing to the correspondence All these together led me on But now one Letter more shall conclude my task  Lord L has just now mentioned to my brother his wishes that he would stand Godfather to the little Lord My brother caught his hand and besought his pardon for not offering  himself  You do me my dear Lord said he both honour and pleasure Where was my thought But this dear creature turning to his Bride will be so good as to remind me of all my imperfections I am in a way to mend for the duties inseparable from my delightful new engagement will strengthen all my other duties  I have taken upon me Sir said she to request the favour of my Lord and Lady L's acceptance of me for a Godmother  To which I have objections said I I have a prior claim Aunt Eleanor has put in hers Lady W hers and this before Miss Byron was  Lady Grandison  Your circumstance my dear Lady G according to a general observation of our Sex is prohibitory  Will you my brother appealed I allow of superstitious observances prognostics omens dreams  O no My Harriet has been telling me how much she suffered lately from a dream which she permitted to give strength and terror to her apprehensions from Mr Greville Guard my dear Ladies against these imbecillities of tender minds In these instances if in no other will you give a superiority to our Sex which in the debate of this morning my Charlotte would not allow of  I will begin my next Letter with an account of this debate and if I cannot comprise it in the compass I intend to bring it into my one more Letter may perhaps stretch into two  LETTER LV  Lady G In Continuation  THE debate I mentioned began on Friday morning at breakfasttime brought on by some of uncle Selby's goodnatured particularities for he will always have something to say against women I bespoke my brother's neutrality and declared I would enter the lists with Mr Selby and allow all the other men present to be of his side I had a flow of spirits Man's usurpation and woman's natural independency was the topic I carried on my argument very triumphantly Nowandthen a sly hint popt out by my brother halfdisconcerted me but I called him to order and he was silent Yet once he had like to have put me outWrapping his arms about himself with inimitable humourO my Charlotte said he how I love my country ENGLAND is the  only  spot in the world in which this argument  can  be properly debatedVery slyWas it not  I made nothing of Mr Selby I called him the tyrant of the family And as little of Mr Deane  Lord L and still less of my own Lord who was as eager in the debate as if it concerned him more than anybody to resist me and this before my brother who by his eyes more than once seemed to challenge me because of the sorry creature's earnestness All those however were men of straw with me and I thought myself very near making Mr Selby ask pardon of his Dame for his thirty years usurpation In short I had halfestablished our Sex's superiority on the ruin of that of the sorry fellows when the debate was closed and referred to Mrs Shirley as moderatrix my brother still excluded any share in itShe indeed obliged me to lower my topsails a little  'I think said the venerable Lady women are generally too much considered as a species apart To be sure in the duties and affairs of life where they have different or opposite shares allotted them by Providence they ought not to go out of their own sphere or invade the mens province any more than the men theirs Nay I am so much of this opinion that tho' I think the confidence which some men place in their wives in committing all their affairs to their care very flattering to the opinion both of their integrity and capacity yet I should not choose and that not out of laziness to avoid the trouble to interfere with the management without doors which I think more properly the man's province unless in some particular cases  'But in common intercourse and conversation why are we to be perpetually considering the  Sex  of the person we are talking to Why must women always be addressed in an appropriated language and not treated on the common footing of reasonable creatures And why must they from a false notion of modesty be afraid of shewing themselves to  be such  and affect a childish ignorance  'I do not mean that I would have women enter into learned disputes for which they are rarely qualified  But I think there is a degree of knowlege very compatible with their duties therefore not unbecoming them and necessary to make them fit companions for men of sense A character in which they will always be found more useful than that of a plaything the amusement of an idle hour  'No person of sense man or woman will venture to launch out on a subject with which they are not well acquainted The  lesser  degree of knowlege will give place to the  greater  This will secure subordination enough For the advantages of education which men must necessarily have over women if they have made the proper use of them will have set them so forward on the race that we can never overtake them But then don't let them despise us for this as if their superiority were entirely founded on a natural difference of capacity Despise us  as  women and value themselves merely  as  men For it is not the hat or cap which covers the head that decides of the merit of it  'In the general course of the things of this world women have not opportunities of sounding the depths of science or of acquainting themselves perfectly with polite literature But this want of opportunity is not entirely confined to  them  There are professions among the men no more favourable to these studies than the common avocations of women For example merchants whose attention is and perhaps  more  usefully as to public utility chained down to their accounts Officers both of land and sea are seldom much better instructed tho' they may perhaps pass through a few more forms And as for knowlege of the world women of a certain rank have an equal title to it with some of them A learned man as he is called who should despise a sensible one of these professions and disdain to converse with him would pass for a pedant and why not for despising  or undervaluing a woman of sense who may be put on the same footing Men in common conversation have laid it down for a rule of good breeding not to talk before women of things they don't understand by which means an opportunity of improvement is lost a very good one too one that has been approved by the ablest persons who have written on the education of children because it is a means of learning insensibly without the appearance of a task Common subjects afford only commonplace and are soon exhausted Why then should conversation be confined to such narrow limits and be liable to continual repetition when if people would start less beaten subjects many doubts and difficulties concerning them might be cleared up and they would acquire a more settled opinion of things which is what the generality much want from an indolence that hinders them from examining at the same time that they would be better entertained than with talking of the weather and such kind of insipidities'  Lady W applauding Mrs Shirley's sentiments Apropos said she let me read you the speech taking it out of her Pocketbook of an EastIndia officer to a pedant who had been displaying his talents and running over with terms of art and scraps of Latin mingled with a profusion of hard words that hardly any of the company understood and which at the same time that it diverted all present cured the pretended scholar of his affectation for ever after My Lady read it as follows  'I am charmed with this opportunity said the officer of discoursing with a gentleman of so much wit and learning and hope I shall have his decision in a point which is pretty nice and concerns some Eastern manufactures of antient and reverend etymology Modern critics are undetermined about them but for my part I have always maintained  that  Chints Bullbulls Morees  and  Ponabaguzzy's  are of nobler and more generous uses than  Doorguzzees  or  Nourfurmannys  Not but I hold against  Byrampauts  in favour of  Niccannees  and  Boralchauders  Only I wish that so accurate judge would instruct me why  Tapzils  and  Sallampores  have given place to  Neganepauts  And why  Bejatapoutz  should be more esteemed than the finer fabrick of  Blue Chelloes  Transcribed from a collection of papers intituled The Plaindealer in Vols Vol No    A very good rebuke of affectation said Sir Charles and your Ladyship hints it was an efficacious one It serves to shew that men in their different attainments may be  equally  useful in other words that the knowlege of polite literature leads not to  every  part of useful science I remember that my Harriet distinguishes very properly in some of her Letters to her Lucy between  Language  and  Science  and that poor Mr Walden that I think was his name was pretty much disconcerted as a pedant may sometimes be when and he bowed to his Harriet he has a  natural genius  to contend with She blushed and bowed as she satAnd I remember Sir said she you promised to give me your animadversions on the Letters I consented you should see Will you be pleased to correct me now  Correct  you my dearest LifeWhat a word is that I remember that in the conversation in which you were obliged against your will to bear so considerable a part you demonstrated that genius without deep learning made a much more shining figure in conversation than learning without genius But upon the whole I was a little apprehensive that true learning might suffer if languages were too slightly treated Mr Walden made one good observation or rather remembred it for it was long ago made and will be always of weight that the knowlege of languages  any more than the advantage of birth was never thought lightly of by those who had pretensions to either The knowlege of the Latin language in particular let me say is of singular use in the mastery of every science  There are who aver that men of parts have no occasion for learning But surely our Shakespeare himself one of the greatest genius's of any country or age who however is an adept in the superior learning the knowlege of nature would not have been a sufferer had he had that greater share of human learning which is denied him by some critics  But Sir Charles said Mr Deane don't you think that Shakespeare who lived before the great Milton has an easier pleasanter and more intelligible manner of writing than Milton If so may it not be owing to Milton's greater learning that Shakespeare has the advantage of that immortal poet in perspicuity  Is the fact certain my dear Mr Deane that Milton wants perspicuity I have been bold enough sometimes to think that he makes a greater display of his reading than was quite necessary to his unbounded subject But the age in which Shakespeare flourished might be called The age of English Learning as well as of English Bravery The Queen and her court the very Ladies of it were more learned than any court of our English Sovereigns was before or hath been since What a prodigy of learning in the short reign of Edward the VIth was the Lady Jane GreyGreek as well as Latin was familiar to her So it was to Queen Elizabeth And can it be supposed that the natural genius's of those Ladies were more confined or limited for their knowlege of Latin and Greek Milton tho' a little nearer us lived in harsher and more tumultuous times  O Sir said Harriet then I find I was a very impertinent creature in the conversation to which you refer  Not so my dearest LoveMr Walden I remember says that learning in that assembly was not brought before a fair tribunal He should have known that it had not a competent advocate in him  But Sir Charles said Mr Beachamp I cannot but observe that too much stress is laid upon Learning as it is called by those who have pretensions to it You will not always find that a scholar is a more happy man than an unlearned one He has not  generally  more prudence more wisdom in the management of his affairs  What my dear Beauchamp is this saying but that there is great difference between theory and practice This observation comes very generously and with regard to the Ladies very gallantly from you who are a learned man But as you are also a very prudent man let me ask you Do you think you have the less prudence for your learning If  not  Is not learning a valuable  addition  But pray Sir Charles said Mrs Selby let me ask your opinion Do you think that if women had the same opportunities the same education as men they would not equal them in their attainments  Women my dear Mrs Selby are women sooner than men are men They have not therefore  generally  the learningtime that men have if they had equal genius's  'If  they had equal genius's' brother Very well My dear Sister Harriet you see you have given your hand to one of the Lords of the creationVassal bow to your Sovereign  Sir Ch  My dearest Love take not the advice without the example  Lady G  Your servant Sir Well but let me ask you Do you think that there is a natural inferiority in the faculties of the one Sex A natural superiority in those of the other  Sir Ch  Who will answer this question for me  Not I said Lord L Not I said Mr Deane Not I said Mr Beauchamp  Then I have fairly taken you inYou would if you could answer it in the Ladies favour This is the same as a confession I may therefore the more boldly pronounce that generally speaking I have no doubt but there is  Help me dear Ladies said I to fight this battle out You say Sr you have no doubt that there is a natural inferiority in the faculties of us poor women a natural superiority in you imperial men  Generally speaking Charlotte Not individually  you  Ladies and  us  men I believe all we who are present shall be ready to subscribe to your superiority Ladies  I believe brother you fib But let that pass  Thank you madam It is for  my  advantage that it should and perhaps for  yours  smilingThere is a difference pardon me Ladies we are speaking  generally  in the  constitution  in the  temperament  of the two Sexes that gives to the one advantages which it denies to the other But we may not too closely pursue this subject tho' the result I am apt to believe would put the matter out of dispute Let us be more at large Why has nature made a difference in the beauty proportion and symmetry in the  persons  of the two Sexes Why gave it delicacy softness grace to that of the womanas in the Ladies befor  me strength firmness to men a capacity to bear labour and fatigue and courage to protect the other Why gave it a distinction both in qualities and plumage to the different sexes of the feathered race Why in the courage of the male and female animalsThe surly bull the meek the beneficent cow for one instance  We looked upon one another  There are exceptions to general rules proceeded he  Mrs Shirley surpasses all the men I ever knew in wisdomMrs Selby and Lady G  What of us brother What of usto the advantage of your argument  Heroic CharlotteYou are both very happily marriedThe men the women the women the men you can mutually assist and improve each other But still  Your servant brother interrupted IYour servant Sir Charles said Mrs SelbyAnd  I  say Your servant too said Mr Selby  Who sees not that my sister Charlotte is ready to disclaim the competition in fact tho' not in words Can there be characters more odious than those of a masculine woman and an effeminate man What are the distinguishing characteristics of the two Sexes And whence this odiousness There are indeed  men  whose minds if I may be allowed the expression seem to be cast in a Female mould whence the fops foplings and pretty fellows who buz about your Sex at public places  women  whose minds seem to be cast in a masculine one whence your Barnevelts my dear and most of the women who at such places give the men stare for stare swing their arms look jolly and those married women who are so kind as to take the reins out of their husbands hands in order to save the honest men trouble  Your servant SirYour servant SirAnd some of them looked as if they had said You cannot mean me I hope and those who spoke not bowed and smiled thanks for his compliment to one fourth of the Sex  My  Lord insultingly rubbed his hands for joy Mr Selby crowed the other men slily smiled tho' they were afraid of giving a more open approbation  O my Sister said I taking Harriet's hand we women are mere NothingsWe are nothing at all  How my Charlotte Make you no difference between being Everything and Nothing  Were it not my dear Ladies proceeded he for male protectors to what insults to what outrages would not your Sex be subject Pardon me my dearest Love if I strengthen my argument by your excellencies bowing to his Harriet Is not the dear creature our good Mrs Shirley's own Daughter All the feminine graces are here She is in my notion what all women should beBut wants she not a protector Even a dream a resverie  O Sir spare me spare me sweetly blushing said the lovely Harriet I own I should have made a very silly a very pusilanimous man It is not long since you know Lady G that I brought this very argument in favour of  Hush Harriet You will give up the Female cause  That is not fair Charlotte rejoined my brother you should not intercept the convictions of an ingenuous mindBut I  will  spare my Harriet if she will endeavour for her own sake to let nothing disturb her for the future but  realities  and not any of  these  long if they are inevitable ones  But pray Sir said I proceed in your argument if you have any more to say  O Charlotte I have enough to say to silence all your opposition were I to give this subject its due weight But we are only for pleasantrysake skimming over the surface of the argument Weaker powers are given generally for weaker purposes in the oeconomy of Providence I for my part however disapprove not of our venerable Mrs Shirley's observation That we are apt to consider the Sex  too much  as a species apart Yet it is my opinion that both God and Nature have designed a very app  rent difference in the minds of both as well as in the peculiar  beauties of their persons Were it not so their offices would be confounded and the women would not perhaps so readily submit to those domestic ones in which it is their province to shine and the men would be allotted the distaff or the needle and you yourselves Ladies would be the first to despise such I for my part would only contend that we men should have power and right given us to protect and serve your Sex that we should purchase and build for them travel and toil for them run through at the call of Providence or of our King and Country dangers and difficulties and at last lay all our trophies all our acquirements at your feet enough rewarded in the conscience of duty done and your favourable acceptance  We were all of us again his humble servants It was in vain to argue the tyranny of some husbands when he could turn upon us the follies of some wives and that wives and daughters were never more faulty more undomestic than at present and when we were before a judge that tho' he could not be absolutely unpolite would not flatter us nor spare our foibles  However if stuck a little with Harriet that she had given Cause to Sir Charles in the dispute which she formerly bore a part in relating to learning and languages to think her more lively than she ought to be and had spoken too lightly of languages She sweetly blushing like a young wife solicitous for the good opinion of the Beloved of her heart revived that cause  He spoke very highly in her praise upon the occasion owned that the Letters he had been favoured with the sight of had given him deeper impressions in her favour than even her Beauty Hoped for farther communications applauded her for her principles and her inoffensive vivacityThat sweet that innocent vivacity and noble frankness of heart said he  taking her hand which I hope you will never think of restraining  As to the conversation you speak of proceeded he I repeat that I  was  apprehensive when I read it that languages were spoken of in it slightly and yet perhaps I am mistaken You my Beauchamp I think if my dearest Life will oblige us both by the communication and  chooses  to do so for that must be the condition on which all her goodness to us must be expected shall be judge between us You know better than I what stories of unexhausted knowledge lie in the works of those great Antients which suffered in the hands of poor Mr Walden You know what the past and present ages have owed and what all future will owe to  Homer Aristotle Virgil Cicero  You can take in the necessity there is of restraining innovation and preserving old rules and institutions and of employing the youth of our Sex who would otherwise be much worse employed as we see in those who neglect their studies in the attainment of languages that can convey to them such lights in every science Tho' it were to be wished that morals should take up more of the learner's attention than they generally do You know that the truest parts of learning are to be found in the Roman and Greek writers and you know that translation were everything worthy our notice translated cannot convey those beauties which scholars only can relish and which learned foreigners if a man travels will expect should not have escaped his observation As to the Ladies Mrs Shirley has admirably observed that there is a degree of knowledge very compatible with their duties Condescending excellence bowing to Mrs Shirley and highly becoming them such as will make them rejoice and I will add improve a man of sense sweeten his manners and render him a much more sociable a much more amiable creature  and of consequence greatly more happy in himself than otherwise he would be from books and solitude  Well but brother you said just now that we were only for pleasantrysake skimming over the surface of the argument and that you had enough to say to silence all my opposition were you to give the subject its due weight I do assure you that to silence all my opposition you must have a vast deal more to say than you have said hitherto and yet you have thrown in some hints which stick with me tho' you have concluded with some magnificent intimations of superiority over usPower and right to protect travel toil for us and lay your trophies at our feet andsoforthSurely surely this is diminishing us and exalting yourselves by laying us under high obligations to your generosity Pray Sir let us have if you please one or two intimation▪ of those weightier arguments that could as you fancy silence your Charlotte's opposition I say that we women were our education the sameYou know what I would be atYour  weightier  arguments if you pleaseor a specimen only  on passant  Supposing my Charlotte that all human souls are in themselves equal yet the very design of the different machines in which they are inclosed is to superinduce a temporary difference on their original equality a difference adapted to the different purposes for which they are designed by Providence in the present transitory state When those purposes are at an end this difference will be at an end too When Sex ceases inequality of Souls will cease and women will certainly be on a foot with men as to intellectuals in Heaven There indeed will you no longer have  Lords  over you neither will you have  Admirers  Which in  your  present estimate of things will perhaps balance the account In the mean time if you can see any occasions that may call for stronger  understandings in male life than in your own you at the same time fee an argument to acquiesce in a persuasion of a present inequality between the two Sexe You know I have allowed exceptions Will you Charlotte compliment yourself with being one  Now brother I feel methinks that you are a little hard upon Charlotte But Ladies you see how the matter standsYou are all silentBut Sir you graciously allow that there  is  a degree of knowledge which is very compatible with the DUTIES of us women and highly  becoming  us will you have the goodness to point out to us what this compatible learning is that we may not mistakeand so become excentric as I may say burst out orb and do more mischief than ever we could do good  Could  I point out the boundaries Charlotte it might not to  some  spirits be so proper The limit might be treated as the one prohibited tree in the garden But let me say That genius whether in man or woman will push itself into light If it has a laudable tendency let it as a ray of the Divinity be encouraged as well in the one Sex as in the other I would not by any means have it limited A little knowledge leads to vanity and conceit I would only methinks have a Parent a Governor a Preceptor bend his strength to restrain its foibles but not throw so much cold water upon the sacred flame as should quench it since if he did stupidity at least dejection might take place of the emanation and the person might be miserable for life  Well then we must  compromise  I think said I But on recollection I thought I had injoined you Sir Charles to the observance of neutrality Harriet whispered I we are only after all to be allowed as far as I can find in this temporary state like tame doves to go about house andseforth as Biddy says in the play  Harriet could she have found time But by mutual consent they are hardly ever asunder would have given you a better account of this conversation than I have done so would Lucy But take it as it offers from  Your everaffectionate CHARLOTTE G  LETTER LVI  Miss  LUCY SELBY  To Lady L  Sunday Nov    MY dear Lady G insists upon my writing to your Ladyship an account of the appearance which the loveliest Couple in England made this day at Church  We all thought nothing could have added to the charms of our Harriet's person but yet her dress and jewels did I sighed from pride for the honour of Female Beauty to  think  they did Can my dear Harriet thought I exquisitely lovely as she is in any dress be ornamented by richer silks than common by costly laces by jewels Can dress add grace to that admirable proportion and th  se fine features to which no painter yet has ever done justice tho' every family related to her has a picture of her drawn by a different hand of eminence  We admired the Bridegroom as much as we did her when before we could have thought he had been half ready he joined Mrs Shirley my Aunt Selby and me in the great Parlour completely dressed But what we most admired in him was that native dignity and ease and that inattentiveness to his own figure and appearance which demonstrate the trulyfine gentleman accustomed as he is to be always elegant  When his Lady presented herself to him and to us  in all her glory how did the dear creature dazle us We involuntarily arose as if to pay our homage to her Sir Charles approached her with rather an air of greater freedom than usual as if he considered not the dress as having added to the value he has for her Yet Loveliest of women he called her and taking her hand presented her to her grandmamma Receive and again bless my Angel said he best of ParentsHow lovely But what is even all this amazing loveliness to the graces of her mind They rise upon me every hour She hardly opens her lips but I find reason to bless God and bless you both my dear Ladies For God and you have given her goodnessMy dearest Life allow me to say that this sweet person which will be your first perfection in every stranger's eye is but a second in mine  Instruct me Sir said she bashfully bowing her face upon his hand as he held hers to  deserve  your Love by improving the mind you have the goodness to prefer and no creature was ever on earth so happy as I shall be  My dear Daughter said her delighted grandmother you see▪ can hardly bare your goodness Sir You must blame her for something to keep down her pride  My Harriet replied he cannot be proud of what the silkworm can do for her or of the jeweller's polish But now you call upon me madam I will tax her with a real fault I open all my heart to her as subjects occasionally offer I want her to have a will and to let me know it The frankest of all Female hearts will not treat me with that sweet familiarity which banishes distance You see my dearest Love that I chide you before your parental friends and your Lucy  It is your own fault Sir Indeed it is You prevent me in all my wishes Awe will mingle with the Love of persons who are under perpetual obligation  My dear two mamma's you must not blame  me  you must blame Sir Charles He takes away by his goodness even the  power  of making suitable acknowlegements and then complains I do not speak  My uncle Selby came in He stood looking upon my cousin for a few moments in silence then broke out Sir Charles Grandison you may indeed boast that you have for a Wife the  Flower of the British world  as you once called her And let me tell you Niece you have for a Husband the noblest and gallantest of men Happy happy Pair say I My dear Mr Deane said he who just then entered if you will keep me in countenance I will venture to salute that charming creature  Sir Charles presented his Bride to them both With a bent knee she received their salutes At that moment came in the three Lords who followed the example Lord W called her AngelSir Charles looked delighted with the praises of his Bride  The rest of the company being come we proceeded to church  We were early but the Church was crouded How were the charming Couple admired on their alighting and as they walked to their pew Never did my Cousin  herself  look so lovely How charmingly looked the Bridegroom But he forgot not that humble deportment full of reverence for the place and the Divine Offices which seemed to make him absent for the time to that splendor and beauty which took every eye  out of  our own pew His example was enough to give a proper behaviour had it been needful to every one  in it  I should have told your Ladyship that Mr Greville had sent evernight a sullenlycomplaisant request to my aunt in writing importing that as he heard the Bride would make her appearance on the morrow the Bridemen and maids if it broke not into our Ceremonial would accept of his pew which  is overagainst ours for the  look  of the thing he said tho' he could not promise but he should all the day curse the occasion By this we found he was not gone to Lady Frampton's as he had designed His offer was thankfully accepted  There was a great concourse of the genteelest people there Everybody men and women looked delighted on the occasion The humility of the Bride was tried by the respects paid her between the offices by all who had ever been in her company They should have reined in their own pride for it was to  that  as much as to respect to her I doubt not that their notice was owing She looked conscious bashful  sly  I told her afterwards She hates the word But as I said she should not have given the idea that made no other word so proper to express it and which must be more observable in  her  generally open free countenance than in that of any other She more than once saw devoirs paid her by a  leer  when her sweet face was so disposed that had she  not  returned the compliment it might have passed that she had not seen them But what an Insensible must have been my cousin had she not been proud of being Lady Grandison She is not quite an Angel yet She has a few  Femalities  as my uncle whimsically calls our little foibles So perhaps she  should  But nobody saw the least defect in your brother His dress most charmingly became him and when he looked upon his Bride his eyes were fixed on her eyes with such a sweet benignity and complaisance as if he saw her mind through them and could not spare a glance to her ornaments Yet by his own dress he shewed that he was not Stoical nonconformist to the fashion of the world But the politeness and respect with which he treated her did them both credit and credit as Lady G observed to the whole Sex Such unaffected tenderness in his respect and known to be so brave so good a manO my dear Lady L what  an admirable man is your brother What a happy creature is my Harriet  When Divine Service was over I was afraid our Procession as I may call it would have been interrupted by the compliments of some of the gentry of our acquaintance whose opened pewdoors shewed their readiness to address them But all passed in silent respects from Gentlemen and Ladie My cousin when she came home rejoiced that one of her parading times was over But when my dearest Love said Sir Charles will the time be past that all who see you will admire you  The Church in the afternoon was still more crouded than before How were Sir Charles and my uncle blessed by the poor and people of low degree for their welldispensed bounty to them  My cousin has delighted Mrs Shirly by telling her that Sir Charles had said there would be a Rite wanting till he and she had communicated according to the order of the Church at the Altar on this particular occasion  Just now is everything settled that Sir Charles wished to be settled Lady G will acquaint you with particulars I doubt not  Permit me to commend myself to your Ladyship's favours as one of the  Humblest and sincerest of your Servants LUCY SELBY  P S  Lady G has half broke my heart  On perusal of what I have written she says I have not done my best I have not given half particulars enoughIn short she finds a multitude of faults with meEven calls me names  Sorry girl lazy  and I can't tell what  But do you madam acquit me and I shall be easy  I told her that I thought I had been very minute  What to a lyinginwoman she says who has no variety before her All one dull chamberscene hourly acted over againThe subject  so  rich  I answered It should then have had the richest penWhy did she not write  herself  If it was  not  for lazinesssake it was for selfsake that she did not As I knew Lady L would have been a gainer by the change of pen I had much rather have been in the company for which she quitted the task than grubbing pens in my closet and all to get nothing but discommendation  I have shewn her this my Postcript She raves But I am hardened She will soon have an oppertunity to supply all my defects in person  END of  VOL VI
