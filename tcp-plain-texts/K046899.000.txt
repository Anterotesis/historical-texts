Right Honourable the EARLS of GRANVILLE CHESTERFIELD AND ORRERY The best Judges of antient Learning AND Most distinguish'd Patrons of modern Merit The following LINES are humbly inscrib'd BY  Their  LORDSHIP's  Most obedient and most devoted humble Servant  THOMAS FRANCKLIN  TRANSLATION A POEM  "SUCH is our Pride our Folly or our Fate  "That few but such as cannot write Translate  So DENHAM sung who well the labour knew  And an age past has left the maxim true  Wit as of old a proud imperious Lord  Disdains the plenty of another's board  And haughty Genius seeks like Philip's son  Paths never trod before and worlds unknown  Unaw'd by these whilst hands impure dispense  The sacred streams of antient eloquence  Pedants assume the task for scholars sit  And blockheads rise interpreters of wit  IN the fair field the vet'ran armies stand  A firm unconquer'd formidable band  When lo Translation comes and levels all  By vulgar hands the bravest heroes fall  On eagle's wings see lofty Pindar soar  Cowley attacks and Pindar is no more  Line  Cowley attacks  c Nothing can be more contemptible than the translations and imitations of Pindar done by Cowley which yet have had their admirers in an Age not quite so sagacious as our own  O'er Tibur's swan the muses wept in vain  And mourn'd their bard by cruel Dunster slain  Lin See Horace's Epistles Satires and Art of Poetry  done into English  by S Dunster DD Prebendary of Sarum  By Ogilby and Trap great Maro fell  And Homer dy'd by Chapman and Ozell  IN blest Arabia's Plains unfading blow  Flow'rs ever fragrant fruits immortal grow  To northern climes th'unwilling guests convey  The fruit shall wither and the flow'r decay  Ev'n so when here the sweets of Athens come  Or the fair produce of imperial Rome  They pine and sicken in th'unfriendly shade  Their roses droop and all their laurels fade  THE modern critick whose unletter'd pride  Lin  The modern critic  c Les belles traductions says Boileau font des preuves sans replique en saveur des anciens qu'on leur donne les Racines pour interpretes ils scauront plaire aujourdhui comme autrefois Certain it is that the contempt in which the antients are held by the illiterate wits of the present age is in a great measure owing to the number of bad translations  Big with itself contemns the world beside  If haply told that Terence once cou'd charm  Each feeling heart that Sophocles cou'd warm  Scours every stall for Echard's dirty page  Or pores in Adams for th'Athenian stage  Lin See Adams's prose translation of Sophocles  With joy he reads the servile mimics o'er  Pleas'd to discover what he guess'd before  Concludes that Attic wit's  extremely low  Lin  Extremely low  A favourite coffeehouse phrase  And gives up Greece to Wotton and Perrault  Lin  Wotton and Perrault  See Wotton's discourse on antient and modern learning and Perrault's defence of his Siecle de Louis XIV  OUR shallow language shallow'r judges say  Can ne'er the force of antient sense convey  As well might Vanbrugh ev'ry stone revile  That swells enormous Blenheim's awkward pile  The guiltless pen as well might Mauro blame  For writing ill and sullying Arthur's fame  Lin  Arthur's fame  See Blackmore's king Arthur an heroic poem  Successless lovers blast the maid they woo'd  And these a Tongue they never understood  That Tongue which gave immortal Shakespear fame  Which boasts a Prior's and a Thomson's name  Gracefull and chaste which flows in Addison  With native charms and vigour all its own  In Bolinbroke and Swift its beauties shine  In Rowe's soft numbers Johnson's nervous line  Dryden's free vein and Milton's work divine  BUT such alas disdain to borrow fame  Or live like dulness in another's name  And hence the task for noblest souls design'd  Giv'n to the weak the tasteless and the blind  To some low wretch who prostitute for pay  Lets out to Curll the labours of the day  Lin  To Curll  c Most of the bad translations which we have of eminent authors were done by garreteers under the inspection of this gentleman who paid them by the sheet for their hasty performances  Careless who hurries o'er th' unblotted line  Impatient still to finish and to dine  Or some pale pedant whose encumber'd brain  O'er the dull page hath toil'd for years in vain  Who writes at last ambitiously to shew  How much a fool may read how little know  Can these on fancy's wing with Plato soar  Can these a Tully's active mind explore  Great nature's secret springs can these reveal  Or paint those passions which they ne'er cou'd feel  Yet will they dare the pondrous lance to wield  Yet will they strive to lift the sevenfold shield  The rock of Ajax ev'ry child wou'd throw  And ev'ry stripling bend Ulysses' bow  THERE are who timid line by line pursue  Lin  There are  c The reader will easily recollect instances to illustrate each of these Remarks more especially the last half our translations being done from translations by such as were never able to consult the original One of these gentlemen having occasion in his version to mention Dionysius of Halicarnassus not having the good fortune to be acquainted with any such writer makes use of the French liberty of curtailing and without scruple calls him Dennis of Halicarnassus Mistakes as gross as this often occur tho' perhaps not many altogether so ridiculous  Anxious to keep th' Original in view  Who mark each footstep where their master trod  And after all their pains have mist the road  THERE are an author's sense who boldly quit  Lin  There are  c The reader will easily recollect instances to illustrate each of these Remarks more especially the last half our translations being done from translations by such as were never able to consult the original One of these gentlemen having occasion in his version to mention Dionysius of Halicarnassus not having the good fortune to be acquainted with any such writer makes use of the French liberty of curtailing and without scruple calls him Dennis of Halicarnassus Mistakes as gross as this often occur tho' perhaps not many altogether so ridiculous  As if asham'd to own the debt of wit  Who leave their fellowtrav'ller on the shore  Launch in the deep and part to meet no more  SOME from reflection catch the weaken'd ray  And scarce a gleam of doubtful sense convey  Present a picture's picture to your view  Where not a line is just or feature true  THUS Greece and Rome in modern dress array'd  Is but antiquity in masquerade  Disguis'd in Oldsworth's verse or Watson's prose  What classic friend his alter'd Flaccus knows  Whilst great Longinus gives to Welsted fame  Lin See Welsted's translation of Longinus done almost word for word from Boileau  And Tacitus to Gordon lends his name  Lin  To Gordon  This gentleman translated Tacitus in a very stiff and affected manner transposing words and placing the verb at the end of the sentence accoding to the Latin idiom He was called in his lifetime TacitusGordon  Unmeaning strains debase the Mantuan muse  And Terence speaks the language of the stews  IN learning thus must Britain's sons decay  And see her rival bear the prize away  In arts as well as arms to Gallia yield  Lin  To Gallia yield  It was said by a great wit in the last war that he should never doubt of our success if we could once bring ourselves to hate the French as heartily as we do the arts and sciences It is indisputable that they are more warmly encouraged and consequently more cultivated and improved in France than amongst us Their translations especially in prose are acknowledged to be more faithful and correct and in general more lively and spirited than ours  And own her happier skill in either field  See where her boasted d'Ablancourt appears  Lin The French had so high an opinion of d'Ablancourt's merit as to think him deserving of the following epitaph  L'illustre d'Ablancourt repose en ce tombeau  Son genie à son siécle a servi de flambeau  Dans ses fameux ecrits toute la France admire  Des Grecs des Romains les precieux tresors  A son trepas on ne peut dire  Qui perd le plus des vivans ou des morts  Her Mongaults Brumoys Olivets Daciers  Careful to make each antient's merit known  Who just to others fame have rais'd their own  Nor wonder these shou'd claim superior praise  A nation thanks them and a monarch pays  Far other fate attends our hireling bard  A sneer his praise a pittance his reward  The butt of wit and jest of every muse  Foes laugh to scorn and even friends abuse  The great Translator bids each dunce translate  The great Translator  c Pope in his epistle to Arbuthnot after his enumeration of dunces concludes with these two Lines  All these my modest satire bade  translate  And own'd that nine such poets made a  Tate  Ver  I make no doubt but the very despicable light in which Translation is here represented may have deterred many from engaging in it who would perhaps have made no contemptible figure in that branch of literature  And ranks us all with Tibbald and with Tate  BUT know whate'er proud Art hath call'd her own  The breathing canvas and the sculptur'd stone  The poets verse 'tis Imitation all  Great Nature only is Original  Her various charms in various forms express'd  They best have pleas'd us who have copy'd best  And those still shine more eminently bright  Who shew the goddess in the fairest light  SO when great Shakespear to his Garrick join'd  With mutual aid conspire to rouze the mind  'Tis not a scene of idle mimickry  'Tis Lear's Hamlet's Richard's self we see  We feel the actor's strength the Poet's fire  With joy we praise with rapture we admire  To see such pow'rs within the reach of art  And Fiction thus subdue the human heart  WHEN Sarto's pencil trac'd the faithful line  Lin Andrea del Sarto being desired by Frederic duke of Mantua to copy a picture of Leo X did it with so much justness that Julio Romano who drew the drapery of that piece under Raphael took his copy for the original and said to Vasari  "Don't I see the strokes that I struck with my own hand  but Vasari shewing him Del Sarto's mark he was convinced of his mistake  The story is told at large in the th chapter of the first book of De Pile's Art of Painting  So just each stroke so equal the design  That pleas'd he saw astonish'd Julio stand  Nor know his own nor Raphael's magic hand  Blushing to find himself enamour'd grown  Of rival charms and beauties not his own  THEIRS be the task to comment and translate  Like these who judge like these who imitate  UNLESS an author like a mistress warms  Lin  Unless c  Roscommon says  "Chuse then an author as you chuse a friend"  Perhaps the image is better drawn from the more lively passion  How shall we hide his faults or taste his charms  How all his modest latent beauties find  How trace each lovelier feature of the mind  Soften each blemish and each grace improve  And treat him with the dignity of love  'TIS not enough that fraught with learning's store  By the dim lamp the tasteless critic pore  'Tis not enough that wit's misguiding ray  Uncertain glance and yield a doubtful day  Not ev'n when both by partial nature giv'n  United bless the favourite of heav'n  Unless by secret sympathy combin'd  Lin  Unless by secret  c A biass of inclination towards a particular author and a similarity of genius in the translator seem more immediately necessary than wit or learning  The faithful glass reflects its kindred mind  Unless from soul to soul th' imparted fire  Congenial catch and kindle warm desire  Ev'n such as lives in Rowe's enraptur'd strain  And gives Pharsalia to our eyes again  Where glowing in each animated line  We see the fiery soul of Lucan shine  Lin See Rowe's translation of Lucan's Pharsalia at the end of which is a short supplement written in the true spirit of the original  Or such as gilds the fair historic page  For Smith reserv'd to grace our latter age  Lin See Smith's translation of Thucydides lately published  Such as o'er Dryden all its influence shed  And bade his muse recall the mighty dead  Such as in Pope's extensive genius shone  And made immortal Homer all our own  Lin If Pope had never produced any thing but his noble translation of Homer it had been sufficient to have established his reputation as a poet  VIEW all that proud antiquity displays  Count o'er her boasted heirs of endless praise  Who thought so nobly or who wrote so well  Britain can shew th' illustrious parallel  Methinks I hear each venerable shade  For base neglect his genuine sons upbraid  Why wou'd not Congreve Afer's charms revive  Or tender Hammond bid Tibullus live  Lin Hammond author of Love elegies  Plautus had pleas'd in Vanbrugh's looser page  And Otway shou'd have trod the Graecian stage  Lucian wou'd shine unveil'd by Swift alone  And Tully calls in vain for Middleton  A Livy's sense demands a St John's stile  And Plato asks a Melmoth or a Boyle  EV'N now there are e'er learning take her flight  And gothic darkness spread a second night  Tho' science droop and ling'ring arts decay  There are who gild the evening of our day  Once more behold majestic in her tears  By Gray adorn'd fair Elegy appears  Lin See Elegy in a country churchyard  Whilst by her side the soft Elfrida stands  Lin Elfrida by Mr Mason  And all our love and all our grief demands  With Roman spirit Johnson's manly page  Lin Samuel Johnson author of the Rambler and also of two fine imitations of Juvenal  Rises severe to scourge a venal age  Brown draws the pen in sacred truth's defence  Lin See Essay on the Characteristics of lord Shaftsbury  And Armstrong paints his own benevolence  Lin See an epistle on Benevolence by Dr Armstrong author of a poem on Health one of the best performances in the English language  From antient models these exalted few  Their fairest forms and bright ideas drew  We know the fountain whence the waters came  Nor wonder at the clearness of the stream  YET still fair Greece we see thy garlands torn  We see thee still thy widow'd altars mourn  On us thy heroes still indignant frown  Or look with awful indignation down  The tears of Rome for injur'd learning flow  And Athens grieves that Britain is her foe  WILL you not rise then O you sons of fame  To vindicate the Greek and Roman name  On friends oppress'd your gen'rous aid bestow  And pay the debt of gratitude you owe  Or can you still their wrongs unpitying see  Nor social join with Warton and with Me  Lin Mr Warton has lately published a new translation of the eclogues and georgics of Virgil and joined it to Mr Pit's excellent translation of the Aeneid  WHILST round his brows the Mantuan ivy twine  Cautious to tread in Attic paths be mine  To fame unknown but emulous to please  Trembling I seek th' immortal Sophocles  GENIUS of Greece do thou my breast inspire  With some warm portion of thy poet's fire  From hands profane defend his muchlov'd name  From cruel Tibbald wrest his mangled fame  Lin Tibbald or Theobald translated two or three plays of Sophocles and threaten'd the public with more  Give him once more to bid the heart o'erflow  In graceful tears and sympathizing woe  A father's death while soft Electra mourn  Or shed her sorrows o'er a brother's urn  Or fair Antigone her griefs relate  Or poor Tecmessa weep her hapless state  Or Oedipus revolve the dark decrees of fate  Cou'd I like him the various passions move  Granville wou'd smile and Chesterfield approve  Each letter'd son of science wou'd commend  Each gentle muse wou'd mark me for her friend  Isis wellpleas'd wou'd join a sister's praise  And Cam applauding consecrate the lays  Speedily will be Publish'd  PROPOSALS For Printing by SUBSCRIPTION  SOPHOCLES  Translated into Blank
