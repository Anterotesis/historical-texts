morning good old Geoffry I have once more eluded the vigilance of my per∣secutoronce more stolen forth from the castle pur∣posely to visit this spot and if my father hears of it I hope he won't be angry with methough he denies me his protection surely he will not pre∣clude me from contemplating scenes that remind me of him and my dear Motherwhy what's the matter you seem agitated  Geoffry  Well I may Miss Julianayour father  is arrived from Italy and I expect him here this very day  Juliana  Expect my father  Geoffry  Ay after an absence of thirteen years I expect Sir Hervey once more at Sutherlandhouse look here's his letter  Juliana  snatching the letter reading and kissing it  Oh I'm so happyI shall at last behold perhaps embrace him  Geoffry  Nay I fear otherwise Sir Hervey is of a most unforgiving disposition and the wrongs your mother put upon him were of a nature not easily to be forgotten  Juliana  Wrongswhat wrongs Geoffry is the dark tale for ever to be concealed from me I am deserted by my father and not to know the causeCome good old man remember you pro∣mised you would one day tell me and since we are alone and may not have another opportunity come nowunveil the mysteryhow how did my mother wrong him  Geoffry  Well then to keep my wordSir Hervey ever was and I fear ever will be a dupe to fashion and its follieshe gamed he intriguedand though in his heart devoted to Lady Sutherland he forsook her and his home for scenes of riot and dissipation  Juliana  Unfortunate infatuation  Geoffry  Lady Sutherland a long while bore this with fortitude and resignation but young beautiful and accomplished surrounded by admirers and neglected by her husband she at last listened to the addresses of an artful and designing villain who convinced her of Sir Hervey's infidelity and by means of forged letters and other artifices persuaded her to elope with him  Juliana  Indeed  Geoffry  'Tis too true madambut her guilt was of short durationin a few days she came back to that house all penitence and shameI shall never forget the dayI told Sir Hervey of her return and he in a fit of rage and madness bid me shut the door against her this she overheard 'twas too much for a tender nature like hersshe fled and soon after dieddied of a broken heart  Juliana  bursting into tears  Oh for mercy my poor poor mother  Geoffry  You were then but eight years old and till that hour the idol of Sir Herveybut your likeness to your mother soon making him wish to avoid you you were removed to the castle where he invested Mrs Dazzle with the unlimited power of a guardian over you and which I fear she has exerted like a tyrant  Juliana  YesSir Hervey could not mean that I should be her prisonerBut go on he went abroad  Geoffry  He did to Naples where he has ever since resided and now what think you madam do you blame the living or the dead  Juliana  I have no right to condemn eitherbut in my mind the husband who neglects an amiable wife is responsible for all the evils that ensue Died of a broken heartoh that he had but par∣doned herthen he had had a wife and I a mo∣ther to console mebut nowDo I indeed resemble her  Geoffry  You doyou do  Juliana  Thank HeavenI may forgive her though my father never can  Worry  speaking without  This way my ladthis way  Juliana  Ha there's Sir Herveythough I wish you don't know how I dread to see him let me be gone  Geoffry  No 'tis only Worry his old faithful fol∣lower honest soul he and your father were fostered by the same nurse and though long since in easy inde∣pendent circumstances he still follows Sir Hervey from motives of affectionSuppose you ask him to be a mediator for you  Juliana  Not nowanother time another time I must return to my prisonbut though I shed tears over the fate of my mother don't fancy I up∣braid my fatherNo I feel for bothand let him still avoid still punish and abandon me I know his motive and the fond hope that he will one day prove a parent to me will make me bear even greater ills with patienceOh may that day be not far off for 'twill be the proudest and the happiest of my life  Exit  Enter  WORRY  and a  Servant  Worry  Mind do as I order you when the baggage arrives let me know  Exit Servant  What Geoffgive me your hand old GeoffSir Her∣vey is but a stage behind'Slife I thought we should never shake hands again  Geoffry  So did I 'tis thirteen years  shaking hands and looking hard at Worry  but heyday how you are altered Master Worry  Worry  Yes I'm not the same man I was  Geoffry  So I see but how has it happened  Worry  I don't knowI lead a different sort of lifeI think and I'm afraid I drink a great deal  Geoffry  You drink you that used to be the most temperate sober  Worry  Ay and I used to hate cards you know now I could play all dayI used to break ap∣pointments now I come an hour before my time and I that always laid in bed till noon now con∣stantly rise with the crowing of the cock  Geoffry  Why what the deuce are you mad  Worry  NoI'm marriedI've got a loving jealous wifeand whilst Sir Hervey is continually miserable because Lady Sutherland ran away from him here am II tell you what Geoffif Mrs Worry were to run away from me I'm sure I should be too much of a philosopher to repine on the occasion  Geoffry  What and is Sir Hervey likewise al∣teredor does he still go on rioting in dissipation and extravagance  Worry  Worse and worseonly yesterday he employed Mr Alltrade to raise five thousand pounds for him on his bondoffered a premium of fifty  per cent  and the moment he receives the money away it will go in galas or at the gaming tableNo I beg pardonnot at the gaming tablenow a days no money ever goes there  Geoffry  What have they left off playing  Worry  Nobut they've left off payingand that's the reason the faro banks are knocked up when people only play for love friendship won't induce them to keep open houseBut Miss Suther∣landthere's Sir Hervey's greatest plague A meeting with her was his chief motive for leaving Italy and now we understand she vindicates her mother and takes part against him  Geoffry  She is belied cruelly belied  Worry  Nay we have it from the best authority Mrs Dazzlethe lady who brought her up and for whom I have a messagebut of this be  assured Geoff Sir Hervey's case isn't half so desperate as minehe's only tormented by a daughter who will try to break his heart but I've got a jealous wife who will actually break my head heart and purse strings  Reenter  Servant  Servant  Sir the baggage is come  Worry  You hearMrs Worry is arrivedCome will you go and be introduced  Geoffry  With all my heartbut mind nowyou'll one day find that Mrs Dazzle has traduced Miss Sutherland and only because she was a great favourite of her late husband's He was a distant relation you know and I did hope would have re∣membered her in his willbut nohe like the rest of her familyhehas forgotten her  Worry  To be sure who ever got any good by these distant relations Mrs Worry has a little thousand and do you know my apartments are so constantly cram'd with cousins neices uncles aunts and grandmothers that at dinnertime I never get a chair to sit uponI eat flyingAnd talk of the comforts of a fireside curse me if I've been within ten yards of mine since the day I was marriednot that I complain of cold thoughmy house is warm enough I promise youbut come along and sorry am I to be convinced of Miss Sutherland's ingratitudeWere she the girl you describe I would not only be her friend and advocate but if Sir Hervey refused to protect her I would myself be a father to her  Exeunt  SCENE  An Apartment in the Castle  Enter Mrs  DAZZLE  and  BETTY  Betty  Even so ma'am Miss Juliana first robbed you of your husband's friendship and now of the Captain's love  Mrs Dazzle  Oh the little viperbut I know how to be amply revengedthe great object of her life is a reconciliation with her fatherthis I have already prevented and will still preventBut the Captain Bettydo you think he has serious views  Betty  He serious what Captain Lavish prefer Juliana Sutherland without a shilling to the widow Dazzle with a nett estate of five thousand ayear  Mrs Dazzle  That's trueI married little Jerry for his fortune and I am certainly sole hei∣ressto be sure I hav'nt yet seen the will because he died in Londonbut I expect his agent Mr Alltrade with it every moment and then Bettypoor JulianaI hope the Captain will allow her half pay  Betty  Oh you're too liberal ma'ambut see here comes Mr Alltrade with the will  Enter  ALLTRADE  Alltrade  Well madam as good as my word you seethis moment arrived with my friend Sir Hervey  Mrs Dazzle  You are very kind Mr Alltrade but there was no occasion to be in any hurryevery body knows how little Jerry loved me  Alltrade  Oh there's no doubt that the will is completely in your favour but you had better open it lest there should be any small bequest or legacies  Mrs Dazzle  Well to oblige you I'll just cast my eye over it    takes the will from  ALLTRADE  Poor Jerryhe used to say he should fall a martyr to love  Reads will    By this my last will I Jeremiah Dazzle give and bequeath all the pro∣perty of which I die possessed unto that most lovely and accomplished of her sex  Spare mespare a poor widow's blushes Mr Alltrade  Alltrade  Nay it's not more than you deserve  Mrs Dazzle  Oh Sir  curtseyingthen reads on  "unto that most lovely and accomplished of her sex Juliana Sutherland"Julianawhy Mr Alltrade  Half crying  Alltrade  Go on  Mrs Dazzle  reads on  Juliana Suther∣land whom being deserted by her father I take a pride in adopting But my will further is that she hold the said property no longer than she re∣mains unmarried In case she marries I give the same to my widow Deborah Dazzle And my only motive for thus tying up my cousin Juliana is to save her from entering into a state to which I fell a martyr  Why it's a forgery he could notdared not  Alltrade  Naythere's no doubt that it's genu∣inebut be composeddoesn't Miss Sutherland live in this house  Mrs Dazzle  She does  Alltrade  Then it dawns it glares upon meMarkif she marries the estate devolves to youare not these Mr Dazzle's words  Mrs Dazzle  They are and I only wish I had been behind him when he wrote them  Alltrade  Well be patientdon't destroy the will because that's a serious business  pulling up his neckcloth  only conceal it till you get Juliana a husbandthen she forfeits the legacy and you become heiress to a hundred thousand pounds  Mrs Dazzle  Why that looks wellbut howthe Captain won't marry her  Alltrade  No but I will in the first place her being in this house will give me numberless oppor∣tunities and in the next I am employed by Sir Hervey to raise five thousand pounds for him on his bondnow if we can get Juliana to join in it I shall have them both so completely in my power that if I fail in the character of a lover I may succeed in that of a creditoryou understand  Mrs Dazzle  I doexcellentand as a re∣ward for your trouble  Alltrade  I only ask a third of the estate  Mrs Dazzle  Grantedit is a bargain  Alltrade  Say you sothen let's to

sincerely wish you may never know the pangs of widowhood  Alltrade  And so do I with all my heart Worry  Worry  And I wish with all my soul you'd both keep your wishes to yourselves  Aside  But I wait upon you madam from Sir Herveyfrom your account of Miss Sutherland's undutiful and indis∣creet conduct he persists in not seeing her and therefore while he stays in the country he begs she may be more closely confined than ever  Mrs Dazzle  I'll do all I can but she is so art∣ful and designing that for my part I don't think she'll ever be safe till she gets a husband to pro∣tect her  Alltrade  Nor I and I'll tell you a secret WorryI love her and wish to be that husband and since from my humble birth and inferior situ∣ation I cannot aspire to gaining Sir Hervey's con∣sent will you aid and assist the marriage  Worry  With all my heartthe more matches the betterWhen one's in a scrape oneself nothing's so consoling as to see all one's friends in the same situation  Aside  I'll assist youbut about the bondhave you raised the five thousand pounds  Alltrade  No and I despair of successthe friend I applied to wants Miss Sutherland to join  Worry  She join why she's as poor  Alltrade  I knowbut he says she has rich re∣lationsmay have a handsome legacyin short it will mend the securitytherefore let Sir Hervey know this and he will see the necessity of com∣manding her to sign instantly

laughing and try∣ing to conceal it  Mrs Dazzle  Why what do you laugh atspeak outyou won't offend me  Worry  Shan't I ma'amthen begging your pardon you need'nt have caution'd me for I al∣ways look on a hatchment outside of a widow's house like a sign over an inna certain emblem of revelry and good cheerAnd when I'm a widoweroh oh oh  shakes his head sighs and exit  Alltrade  So far so well he's in our interestbut to get this bond out of Sir Hervey's hands we must at least advance a few hundreds and where to raise even thosefor my part I haven't a guinea  Mrs Dazzle  Nor I now a shilling  sighing  nor do I know where to raise one  Alltrade  No  Mrs Dazzle  No unless indeed Mr Mist the manager of our country theatre  Alltrade  What the quondam silversmith of Cheapsidehe's an old friend

short and simple tale One day when I had liberty to ride within the pre∣cincts of the castle my horse ran away with me and he in stopping it broke his arm I could do no less than confess the obligation and since his recovery often visiting Mrs Dazzle our intimacy encreased and gratitude grew into love  Worry  And all the time did you know of the duel  Juliana  No till yesterday I never heard of it and then I instantly informed him that though Sir Hervey neglected his duty to me I could never forget mine to him and nothing should induce me to receive that man as a lover who designed to be the murderer of my father  WORRY  crosses her as if going    Why what's the matterwhere are you going  Worry  To Sir Hervey to bid him remove you from the protection of a hypocrite and place you

Enter  FRANK  and a  Workman  Frank  Ha ha so you've no sooner finish∣ed that whimsical outoftheway job  pointing to the recess  than he sends for you about another  Workman  Ay your master is an excellent cus∣tomeralways up to his chin in brick and mor∣tar and then for price'gad he never haggles about price  Frank  No and the best of the joke is he calls himself an economist and comes down here on a saving scheme  Workman  A saving scheme  Frank  Ay finding himself a little out of elbows in London and the present state of the Continent not allowing him to travel he came here to  live cheap and retrenchAnd there  pointing to recess again  there's one specimen of his economyOn the journey he bought a statue of Venus  Workman  I know and a great bargain it was it only cost him five pounds  Frank  True but not choosing to have his beauties gazed at he employed you to build that strange sort of recess to put it in which has cost him at least five times the sumThis is always the way if he bought a cheap boat he'd cut a canal for it and if a pulpit he'd build a church for itin fact he is a false economista selfdeceiver and here he comes to elucidate my description  Enter  LAVISH  Lavish  Oh if I go on in this close saving way only six months longer I shall be able to return to town and dash like the best of themnever was such a hand at buying bargainsFrank come here you roguejust now at Squire Brozier's sale what do you think I gave for a curricle only forty pounds there there's economy for you  Frank  Economybegging your pardon SirI see no economy in buying what you don't want  Lavish  Howwould you let a bargain flip through your fingers you extravagant rascal  Frank  Nobut you've no horses Sir and a curricle's useless  Lavish  That's what I said says I a curricle is useless without horsesso I bought a pair di∣rectly  Frank  Bought a pair  Lavish  Ay gave a hundred and twenty pounds for themto be sure it's money but one's own carriage saves posting and drivers in short the worst come to the worst 'tis but a hundred and fifty pounds and I'll save it a thousand waysWho are you Sir  to Workman  Workman  I have finish'd that job all but fixing up the statue Sir and now I come about the billiardroombut to speak honestly it is not worth repairing  Lavish  So I thought I thought it wasn't worth repairing  Workman  No Sir and a new room will not cost above three hundred poundsbut then to be sure it will be elegant and lasting  Lavish  So it will and the first expence is the least so up with the new room  Workman exit  And now to finish my vindication to Juliana  Sits at the table and writes    Your late mo∣ther was not only my relation but my friend and benefactress and on Sir Hervey's one day reprobating her conduct with unusual asperity gratitude prompted me to defend it perhaps more warmly than I ought and a duel was the result    Knocking at the door  See who's there  FRANK  exit    But what signifies writing while she's immured in her present den I haven't a chance of successMrs Dazzle formerly se∣duced me into some gallantries and a disappointed widow is the devil  Reenter  FRANK  laughing  Frank  Sir I beg pardon

lame my own horsesget a chaise and four  Frank  Chaise and fouris this the way to re∣trenchand consider Sir Miss Sutherland has no money and you always said you'd never marry any woman who had less than ten thousand pounds  Lavish  I did but that's an aukward sum a woman with ten thousand pounds expects houses horses carriagesin short to spend double her own income and her husband's too But a woman without a farthing she manages the house mends the linen nurses the children scolds the servantsOh that's the real rich wifeand the poor Ju∣liana will be the best bargain I ever madeSo go do as I tell you and observe I'll marry her if I sacrifice my whole fortune in the pursuit  Frank  Sacrifice your whole fortune Sir  Lavish  Ay I will if I save it a thousand ways  Exeunt  SCENE  Outside of

ESQ  Spoken by Mr  FAWCETT  in the Character of  MIST  A London Manager of high degree  I Peter Mist now enter here O P  My country playhouse e'er I came to town  Almost knock'd up has been in lots knock'd down  A sturdy farmer bought the wallswhy then  What was a barn will be a barn again  Corn on the stage not mummers will be seen  And oats be thresh'd where actors should have been  Wheat strew the boards where erst did heroes tread  To makewhat heroes never made therebread  Stagestruck but henpeck'd honest Justice Dunder  Has all my cloudshis lady has my thunder  Dick Drench the snug apothecary means  To give a private play so buys my scenes  Drench "smelling of the shop" and  idem semper  Could not resist scenes painted in distemper  The Member for the town bought all my coats  There he was wisefor I command two votes  And playhouse coats again he shew'd discerning  Will suit a Member for they're us'd to turning  My wigs the women quarrell'd for sweet souls  My daggers stuck in selling but my bowls  Mine host of the Red Lion clapp'd his eyes on  And bought 'em as I did to serve up poison  Thus all my country stock as Shakspeare says  "My cloudcapt towers my gorgeous palaces  "Yea my great globe" the barn so much involv'd  And "all it did inherit have dissolv'd"  But if some future Manager should take  My "solemn temple" which I now forsake  My "fabric of a vision" he will find  That I have left a cursed "wreck behind"  Here then I come by rural schemes half undone  But country stumps appear new brooms in London  Egad I'll sweep all cleanlook to'tne'er doubt me  A London Manager I'll lay about me  And as a sample you shall hear my hints  To be inserted in tomorrow's prints  "A five act play last night was represented  "By an amazing  Dramatist  invented  "Author's and Actors' merits were immense  "And Fawcett e'en surpass'd his usual excellence  "Great care 'tis plain was taken in rehearsal  "And"may I add with  truth  "applause was "universal"  PLAYS  c printed for  LONGMAN  and  REES No Paternoster Row  The VOTARY OF WEALTH a Comedy by Mr HOLMAN s  LAUGH WHEN YOU CAN a Comedy by Mr REYNOLDS s  The DRAMATIST a Comedy by Ditto s
