Exhortation to his Fellows in the Faith  THOSE vain talebearing Books entitled Memoirs have so far sub∣verted Readers that the truth is to them but a threadbare Garment  Unsatisfied are they with each History unless the Writer delivereth all the Parti∣culars concerning every Person whom he memorialises from the Colour of an Eye∣brow even unto the Pattern of a Shoebuckle  Since therefore it accordeth that Nar∣rators must use such Precision enforced am I to extend my Plan the primitive  Design of which was no more than to repeat the Spiritmoving Discourses that preceded this Play Actor and comical Comedians Regeneration which were utter'd unto him by the great Mr  Whit∣field  the good Mr  Wesley  the pious Mr  Bradbury  and the learned Mr  Romaine  But now it behoveth me for expediting the Sale of my Book to give an Account of his Birth Parentage Education Charac∣ter and Behaviour Yet for as much as it doth not in any Sort suit me to deliver those Historialisms according to the Va∣nity of the Times I have agreed with a Scribe of this Town vulgarly called a Wit and he hath undertaken to Dress these Anecdotes in all the fashionable Language of fine fangled Phrases for the Perusal of the Publick  ADIEU  Scene  st    Page  SCENE the FIRST  DANCING MASTER EDITOR ZAPHANIEL  O  NE afternoon as I was preparing a Political Essay for the next day's Chronicle in answer to a letter I had inserted the week before on the other side the question the boy from the blue posts said two gentlemen wanted me at his master's  My dear wife whose prudence and person are unequalled was unwilling I should go but upon recollection I ventured not without some necessary precaution I must confess and was inducted into a room where two very well look∣ing men were seated  The shortest of them was dressed in a laced coat a fine flowered gold and silver waistcoat figured Ruffles a heart at his shirt bosom made of green and red stones he had a sword and a bunch of ribbands at the handle and he held a snuffbox in his hand  As his complexion was of the olive tint his eyes vacant his nostrils charged with rappee and his eyebrows forehead and other parts of  his face indicating he much practised the look contemptuous I took him for some foreign no∣bleman just imported but he was a figure danc∣er at the Operahouse and thus he opened the business to me  DANCING MASTER  Sir we have taken the liberty to send for you because we hear you are an author That gentleman  pointing to his friend who wore his own dark brown hair parted on the top of his head and smòothly stroked down each side of his temples then tucked behind his ears as you have seen window curtains turned back  Mr Zaphaniel has got some very curious stories relating to a particular play∣er but he wants to have them put into a pro∣per stile  EDITOR  What sort of a stile Sir  DANCING MASTER  Nay as to that Sir it will be left to you I have nothing to say to stile for  my  partGen∣tlemen like me never read I never looked in∣to a Book in my lifeI keep my chariot Sir and people nowadays don't keep their cha∣riots by book reading  EDITOR  Would you have it in a drole stile Sir  DANCING MASTER  Ay Ay as drole as you can faithtouch up all the actors and singers in it They are on∣ly fit to be made game with as to the dancers you may let them alone only if you can cle∣verly throw in any hints about myself for I teach most of the people of fashion in town I am indecd the best dancer either for execution or address or school business in Europe I  hate vanitybut I'll tell you more of myself when you come to dine with meWhere's the papers Zaffy  ZAPHANIEL  There they are tied up together in the win∣dow thou may'st take them home  addressing himself to me  peruse the contents give me thy opinion of them I will come to thee at the se∣venth hour on wednesday next as this porter seemeth to be very good we will assemble here  DANCING MASTER  But Sir  addressing himself to me likewise  that you may be the better able to understand what you are about you should have an idea of the person who this history is wrote upon there∣fore come to me next sunday two o'clock to dine at Jemmy Warner's NED will be therè and Nancy with him NANCY you must know Sir is a wench he's a friend to for the fellow faith has a devilish smart sort of a genius for high life although he is but a player he keeps his girl wears embroidery drinks burned cham∣paign and betts his as freely as if he was the best nobleman or dáncing master in Eng∣land  EDITOR  But Sir you spoke something of mentioning you in these memoirs  DANCING MASTER  You must know Sir there is no doing any good in the world without puffing It does not signify if you are the cleverest fellow that can be in your way without you can puff your∣self off or get your friends to puff you off you will never get forwards for it is not now the question whether an artist is a genius But whe∣ther  he is in fashion Now there are several ways of managing this bringing a man into fash∣ion some chuse to bribe a very great lady's hairdresser others get into fashion 'cause their fathers have a vote or their sister a pretty face or they were born on this side or that side Ber∣wickbridge or becausebecausein short Sir there are many schemes but I don't like any of them half so well as printing your me∣rits in the news papers or writing a book about it  I was let into the secret by my master who got all his money by advertising For as he said never mind what other people say do you say as much as you can for yourself and keep at it and if you will go on telling the town so you will talk them into it until they believe every syllable about you  The MSS I took home with me and being promised ready money began to digest the ma∣terials immediately  ACT I  SCENE II  Master  Neddy's  Descent ascertained from the Antidiluvian  British  Records of the  Llwhyddwhuydd  Family  NO not all the wives in the world shall persuade me to it Not for all the wives in the world would I suffer such a thing  stamping with his foot at the same time and throwing his hat hard  upon the ground  Bite my nose What the devil business has she to long to bite my nose If it was a child of my own getting and I loved the mother ever so well I would not allow it  Thus was Mr Thomas Ap Morgan a Welch chairman very vehemently telling his mind to David Llwhyddwhuydd his partner David mild∣ly replying you know my dear countryman that now I am the very last look you of all the Llwhyddwhuydds in all Wales and will any countryman of mine any true Briton and there are no true Britons but Welch folks you know Thomas  THOMAS  Yes to be sure I do and thank God for that I am but a Welchman truly but I am a true Briton and Britons never will be slaves and therefore why should your wife want to bite my nose then  DAVID  Now Thomas would you have the most ancientest family in all Wales and all Merio∣nethshire to boot as indeed mine is to be ex∣tinguished rather than let yourself be put to a little pain and if my wife should miscarry there is an end of all my hopes for only Providence and good Sir Watkins knows when I shall be able to get another child for we have been a long time about this and if we lose this all my hopes of having a family to inherit my nam  is gone because you know we have never a∣nother child in the world but that which is coming to be born now  Thomas picking up his hat and wiping the flaps of it with his elbow replied you know David that I would not have Mrs Llwhyddw∣huydd vexed now she is so near her downlying upon any account but why should you say yours is the most ancientest family in Wales did not the Ap Morgans go to meet William the conqueror  DAVID  God's blessings upon us both I am ashamed to hear a Welchman talk of any thing so little a while ago as William the conqueror why my family I have all the parchment account of it at home was in Wales before the deluge  THOMAS  But where did they go when the world was drownded  DAVID  Why they went on board ship with Captain Noah and the ship settled upon a very high mountain and the mountain was Penmanmuir and Wales was the first place peopled again and Japhet married into our family and I have some of his blood now in my veins and our family has been in Merionethshire ever since Now here lies the point my dear Suppose my son because my wife should lose her longing is to be born without a nose or  God help us  with two noses now for great authors say that a woman with child when she longs or is affrighted the effects will be the same upon the child  THOMAS  But I don't believe it no more than if I am carrying a fare and a dog shall come behind  Page  th    me and bite my leg that the gentleman or the lady look you in the chair shall have the print of the dog's teeth in their skin  DAVID  But I will shew you friend Thomas from the testimony of learned wise men  pulling a book out of his pocket  I copied them with my own handwriting to convince you of the dan∣ger that may attend letting my wife that you profess so much friendship for lose her longing  THOMAS  Well you know Mr David I love to hear histories so let us sit down  They did so and Mr Lwhyddwuyd began to read the testi∣monies of the learned as follows  CASE I  Aldrovandus  relates that a woman in Sicily observing a lobster taken by a fisherman and being moved by an earnest longing for it brought forth a lobster altogether like what she had seen and longed forVide the copper∣plate  II Is told by  John Swammerdam  A certain woman at Utrecht being with child was frighted with the sight of a negro and appre∣hended to be delivered of a perfect black but at last recollecting herself she made use of a second imagination to prevent the danger from the first for she washed herself from head to foot with hot water to clear the child from blackness The time of her delivery being  come the child was born with all his teeth and appeared perfectly white except those places the hot water did not reach  III By ditto A child was born in Normandy with horns upon his head and cloven feet and he proved afterwards to be a man of extraordi∣nary sense and judgment the occasion of that misfortune was that his father having repre∣sented a satyr upon the stage had the knowledge of his wife in that ridiculous dress  IV We have a case in  Fabricius Hildanus  upon the faith of  Ludovicus Horniceus  a phy∣sician of Frankfort viz a woman having been frighted with the firing of a gun was delivered of a child with a wound in the back of the same shape as if it had been done with a mus∣quet shot  V Father  Malebranche  in his search after truth relates that seven or eight years ago was seen in the hospital of incurables a young man who was born an idoet and whose body was broken in the same places where malefactors are broke he had lived near twenty years in that condition and has been seen by several persons The cause was his mother hearing a criminal was to be broke went to see the exe∣cution  Father  Malebranche  proceeds to explain this strange accident children says he see what their mothers see they hear the same cries they receive the same impressions of the objects and are moved by the same passions all the blows given to the malefactor did violently strike the  mother's imagination and by the counterblow the tender and soft brain of the childThe fibres of the child's brain not being able to re∣sist the torrent of the spirits were broken that's the reason why he came into the world without understanding The violent course of the mother's animal spirits went with force from her brains to the several parts of her body which answered to the parts of the malefactor 'twas the same in the childbut because the bones of the mother were capable to resist the violence of the spirits they were not wounded But this rapid stream of the spirits was capable to carry away the soft and tender parts of the bones of the child and 'tis to be observed that if the mother had determined the motion of the spirits toward any other part of the body her child had not had his bones broke but that part which answered to the part towards which the mother determined her spirits had been sore∣ly wounded  VI A gentlewoman of Helsenor says  Bar∣tholin  was delivered of a great cat which to the astonishment of the assistants ran away with great celerity and was never seen afterwardsbecause the lady was frightened with one  VII  Bartholin  also relates I have it he says from  John Naborousky  a gentleman of Poland and my good friend that a woman of that country was brought to bed of two small fishes without scales which were no sooner born but they swam in the neighbouring waters as naturally as others do because the lady did long for them so that you see my friend Thomas  look you it is all the same according to the o∣pinions of these learned people whether a lady is frighted or whether a lady longs  THOMAS  Well let us hear some more stories in the Name of GodI do love to hear such things to be sure but God help me for my own sake but to be sure I cannot believe all these things so well as the scholars do because I have not their learning but go on do my friend do go on  Which request David obeyed immediately  VIII  Philippus Meurs  apostolical prothono∣tary and cannon of St Peter's in Louvain a re∣verend ancient man affirmed unto me and se∣veral others says our author  Thomas Fienus  that he had a sister compleat in the rest of her body but without a head Instead of which was joined to her neck a shell fish in the like∣ness of a seamuscle made up of two shells which shut and opened and by which from a spoon she took her nourishment And this he said was occasioned for that the mother with child with her had a strong desire after some muscles she beheld in the market but could not procure at that instant This sister of his lived in this monstrous condition to be eleven years old and then by accident happening angrily and very strongly to bite the spoon they fed her with and breaking the shells died quickly after  IX  Schenkius  tells of a woman very big who among other discourses with her neighbours mention being made of her great belly she told them she reckoned about the time of Epiphany  or festival of the three kings Upon which the good woman wishing she might bring forth three kings she merrily answered with all her heart and accordingly at the time she bore three sons one of them an Ethiopian or of a black colour as usually one of those kings are painted The same relation is confirmed by  Cornel Gemma  being seen as he says by great multitudes in the city of Louvain and authenticated by un∣doubted testimony  X There was a lady a kinswoman of mine says Sir  Kenelm Digby  who used much to wear black patches upon her face a fashion among young women which I to put her from used to tell her in jest that the next child she should go with should come into the world with a great black spot in the midst of its forehead and the apprehension was so lively in her ima∣gination that she had a daughter born and marked just as the mother had fancied with a great black spot upon her  XI There lived amongst us at Bern in Swit∣zerland says  Gul Fabricius  an honest woman who about ten years since being great with child and quarrelling with another woman put herself into such a passion that she was unable to con∣tain herself After which falling into labour she was brought to bed of a daughter of a cou∣ragious and heroick mind but her feet and hands contracted as if ready to fight and her whole body in continual motion so that she walks as it were dancing and in a trembling posture after the manner of angry people unable to govern their passion  XII  Amb Parey  gives us to understand that in the year a child was born in a village near Fontainbleau with the shape of its face exactly like that of a frog which was brought to pass by the mother's holding that creature in her hand to allay the heat of a fever about the time of her conception  XIII But something singular beyond all these is the tale of  Languis  of a woman longing to bite the naked shoulder of a baker passing by her which rather than she should lose her longing the goodnatured husband hired the baker at a certain price Accordingly when the bigbellied woman had bit twice the baker's wife broke a∣way from the people who held her would not suffer her to bite her husband again for want of which she bore one dead child with two living ones  Why then I say thus Thomas very loudly began hitting his hand hard upon the table I say the baker was  At that instant a voice from the street called chair chair out run Mr David and Mr Tho∣mas the book the nose the wife were in an instant forgot for the occult desire of moneygetting annihilates all other considerations as black absorbs all factitious colours  How the chairman came to be so learned as we all love to know every thing courteous rea∣der you shall if you please be informed  Upwards of twenty years had he taken in the Magazines and had made so many abstracts and remembered so many extracts that if he had  Page  not been a chairman he might have been made honorary professor of universal erudition  He was the living Lexicon to which the whist and jockey clubs applied whenever they made a bett about spelling a word and he had from observation acquired such a genius or power in disputation that all smatterers he silenced as easily as Socrates did the Sophists if a true scho∣lar happened to contradict him David from his knowledge of the world dumfounded the stu∣dent by offering him ten pound on't for he proceeded upon one general and not an often controverted principle  i e  no rich men will mind learning  ergo  only poor folks are scho∣lars  Therefore every fool every dunce dares to assert to contradict to find fault or praise even with the utmost ignorant effrontery and oppose the opinions of men of real meritblockheads having one undeniable resource the proposing a wager  Mrs Llwhyddwhuydd master Neddy's mama was born in America the daughter of a mulatto woman her papa the famous councellor Justice who was sent abroad on account of some books being missing The grandfather's disgrace is the reason why none of his descendants ever chose to learn their letters  Hence as  Heinsius  observes it is very easy to account for the Hero of this History being illiterate  Miss Justice was imported undercook to a WestIndian family who came to England for improvement they hired a fine house the south side of Maidstone within half a mile exactly  of the marketplace and on the righthand of the London road  N B  The utmost precision is made use of in re∣lating the situation of the house because an attention to truth is the Editor's greatest care throughout the whole of this publication  In Maidstone at this time there was a compa∣ny of Comedians that town and county being remarkable for the residence of such sort of peo∣ple It is an observation of naturalists that turnips and attornies thrive best in Norfolk that Sussex is noted for bad roads and smug∣glers and that it is as impossible to eradicate buggs from London as to free Kent from Hop∣pickers Gipsies and Stroling Players  In all rural theatrical communities it is the custom of one of the actors to carry playbills to the people of fashion's houses about the coun∣try and as these Jamaica gentlefolks were re∣markable for sumptuous living the manager cast himself into that part of the business this occasioned much murmuring when his back was turned among the rest of the company they would meet at the alehouse and call him all the scoundrels and tyrants imaginable but the moment they saw him returning they run out of the room begged he would drink with them and happy was he who could get his handker∣chief out first to wipe the dust off from his mas∣ter's shoes He loved like most of his brethren eleemosinary high living therefore he never missed carrying up a bill every morning to the West Indian squires and used to wait in the hall at first along with the butcher's boy to know their honours commands  Scene  th    Page  The Moonlight amour  But Miss Justice being very fond of players asked this proprietor of cloaths and scenes to step into the pantry where the rest of the servants assembled there he was treated with several remnants of danties saved from yesterday's din∣ner and he made the kitchen company vastly merry for he could be exquisitely entertaining  He spoke Tragedy speeches to them he show∣ed them tricks he made them faces he sung songs he acted the lame man and the stutter∣ing man and stood upon his head and drank out of his shoe no man had more wit than he had and he rehearsed all the other comicalities by which benefitmaking geniuses push their tickets off The young lady abovementioned fell in love with this master actor his name or at least the name he went by was Samly and as Mr Samly was seeing Miss Justice home from the playhouse in about a week afterwards she confessed her affection to him and informed him that she had forty nine pounds of her own and in her own possession all in specie  Samly immediately fell in love with her they vowed eternal fidelity to each other and rati∣fied those vows by the most particular engage∣ment before they went out of the home close while the bright stars in the fiery fretted canopy of heaven sparkled over their heads and the silent gloworms twinkled at their sides the leafy hedges rustling to their embraces and the whoping owls at distance toot tooting to their sighs as Mr Samly observed made up great nature's loving concert The next week unknown to any of their acquaintance they set out for London together Samly left his cloaths and scenes behind him indeed they were mortgag∣ed  for rather more than the worth to the land∣lord of the stable in which they acted  The Editor of this Treatise remembers this Mr Samly's company at Maidstone and they had the use of a brewhouse to shift their cloaths in the ladies dressingplace was the mashtub and Alexander the Great he has known to re∣hearse his mad scene very cleverly in the cooler  The brace of lovers determined to remain in cog for some time in London because as Miss Justice said what would all the world think of her if all the world should come to know it therefore desired Mr Samly would get a licence as soon as possible  That he promised upon his honour should be his next morning's business and added at the same time  my ineffable Chloe we will content ourselves with these lodgings for the present what to thee or me does it a drachma signify if as yet we are at St Giles  's  or St James  's  no we are ourselves let us be where we please  Upon the instant he brandished his lady's cur∣ling irons with which he was then pinching his bag wigMajestically he strode cross the room and then with most emphatical dignityhespit out of the window  Resuming his subject thus he went on  be∣fore the winter comes on thou opening rose of beau∣ty we'll take a ready furnished house in some of the genteel squares about Piccadilly But first I'll de∣termine with myself which Theatre I chuse to belong toA man of my merit my lovely attractress will be caressed by the managers of both houses so I'll play them off one against t'other promise them both and at last who bids most has me I know my cuebut I am resolved never to come upon the square of  common salary actors no I will have so much cer∣tain when I play or else such a sum of money out of the house as a sharer and this way  hitching up his breeches at the same time  this way I shall keep up my consequence and consequence is what an actor ought to study as much ay and more than his parts  But it happened to Mr Samly as it may have to thee reader his expectations were superior to his advancement the managers of both Theatres refused him  His case was very severe he had a great mind to print it to let the town know how he was used he did so but it did not answer any pur∣pose the public took no notice of it and the bookseller lost money by it  His lady's fortune being soon dissipated duns grew exceedingly impertinent misfortunes pre∣sented themselves before him in all the fright∣ful phantoms of hunger bad shoes bum bailiffs rainy weather no trust and an empty coalhole he cursed the pride of managers their ignorance their inhumanity he damned the town he de∣spised life he grew desperate and one morning before the fringed covering of his lady's eyelights were withdrawn he went down stairs and opening the streetdoor he I am afraid it will never be believed but the fact is authentic and I can bring several reputable people to wit∣ness the truth of ithe that very morning resolvedto work at his own business and relinquish the stage for ever saying with Car∣dinal Wolsey  Farewel a long farewel to human greatness  onwards he went leaving his lady London his creditors and choice spirits making the best of his way to his own parish in Notting∣hamshire  to work at the stocking frame  nor cast one longing lingring look behind  SCENE III  Miss  Shred  and Miss  Justice  MISS Justice received a letter from Samly that very day by the pennypost with his reasons for absenting himself and as the epistle is really curious we shall present a copy of it to the reader recommending the author to the notice of the gentlemen publishers of Periodical Papers as a proper person to be employed by them when they need a journalistSince he can moralise seems to know mankind has a pretty knack at abuse can write very well on the worst side the question does not much mind orthography and by his manner I fancy him neither timid hesitating or conscientious  To  Mrs SAMLY  My dear Adorable  WHEN I consider life 'tis all a cheat as to the managers blast such scoun∣drels however I'm resigned to fate whatever world I next am thrown upon cannot be worse than thisas I am now determined to rennounce the follys passions and delights of desire I have been obliged to leave thee my life and soul my all that heaven can give what can I do while there was one thing my charmer had  left to raise money upon did I desert herno did I not my lovely creature stay with thee till the last penny was spent for we were rich in love but now approaching want with all its wofill train appearing I retire from the storm not being able to live my dear and see thee in distress therefore have cut myself off from all the plea∣sure of loved London and thee the chief and condescend curse on my stars to the vile me∣kanicall method of being obliged to get bread by working at my business  I leave you in good hands I know my land∣lord loves you and if during my exile as he is rich you admit him into my throne only for a time why it will be political I give you leave as it may expedite my recall As Congreve says he takes your body I your mind I must have the better bargainremember this is my request nay my command to yield yourself up to one person for the sake of another and what is done by the finest women in England and what I would do for you with the finest woman in England  Adieu  After Samly had put the letter in the post∣office he recollected his dear Chloe could not readhowever upon reflection he was not sorry for that  for by heavens and all the ingenuity of arts and sciences  he called out  it is an elegant Epistle equal to any of Pope's literary correspondence and whoever my girl gets to read my letter for her will and must admire the writer and with me lament the loss which the town must receive by those fellows of managers not employing me  Just as the epistle abovementioned came to hand it happened that Miss Shred was upon a visit to Miss Justice or Mrs Samly as she was called in the neighbourhood This young lady the visitor had a very great taste for plays her∣self and was an occasional actress at Richmond and at Bartholomew Fair her father has been breeches seater to me these nine years and it was from his mouth that I have been assured of the authenticity of this relation  As soon as Miss Justice had heard the letter read she shrieked she stamped she wrung her hands she took salts not Ariadne for the loss of Theseus not a quean condemned to the duckingstool notbut no allusions could carricature her Her lamentations brought up the landlord Mr Llwhyddwhuydd to whom Miss Shred discovered Samly's perfidy although she did not show him the letter but begged Mr David would leave the lady a little until she came to herself As it is good manners to do so we will attend the chaircarrying gentleman down stairs who rejoiced exceedingly at the two pieces of good news as he called them  In the first place to find Mr Samly was not her husband and in the next place to suppose Mr Samly was run away from her for David long had loved long had he secretly admired her  The tender God of soft desires roused all the sentimental soul of Llwhyddwhuydd softning his heart as vinegar will render marble supple  'Twas on the th day after Mr Samly and his Chloe had taken the lodgings that Miss Justice fryed some beef stakes and onions for Mr Samly's dinner and invited their land∣lord to the feast so relishing was the sauce  Page  so crisp the vegetables that the landlord thought her the finest woman he ever saw but when on the next day he discovered her darning so nicely her gallant's stocking which like a French chicken glove she had drawn upon her arm while Samly was rehearsing Othello the conquest was complete he became perfectly her slave and sighing vowed upon his honour madam Samly was the most compleatest gentle∣woman to look to that ever he did see in all his life Dash not the book down oh ye de∣licate because I have related unembellished the beginning of love Love has many begin∣nings but one ending Love is like the city of London in a map of England and the senses are the turnpike roads on which travellers trot to it Love is like the tunes in the Beg∣gars Opera nay its like the Beggars Opera itself because the catastrophe is often brought about very unexpectedly  Men have odd tastes why then should David be blamed for this Is it not common for ladies to relate the surprising conquests they have made over their husbands and the simple means by which those victories have been obtained Ma∣dam Blanch avowed to me her spouse fell in love with her for her small ear The deputy's wife shot her good man with a pair of black sattin shoes and stone buckles the motion of the hips in walking has made many lady's for∣tune Esquire Pointer declared but last week he was particularly struck with the white point of his wife's elbow and with allbecoming re∣verence for the marriage state do I speak this as I am myself in that nuptial band I was won to surrender my liberty to the all excellent graces  of my wife who in her virgin state alarmed my eager desires when she threw herself into that most graceful attitude of tying her garter Here I must beg leave to be indulged with some anecdotes concerning my spouse  She was born she was bred a gentlewoman I married her out of Sir Trinket Trolly's family her mamma was companion to lady Trolly and my wife born in that house was educated in all the becoming elegance inherent to a woman of the first quality  While I paid my addresses to her several wealthy tradesmen proffered her their services but her soul was above mixing with vulgarities She scorned to listen to the voice of mechanic moneylovingslaves she valued the addresses of a man of wit more than all Peru  On that hint I spoke  She lov'd me for the stories which I told  And I loved her 'cause she did listen to them  The rules of politeness obliged us to leave the afflicted Miss Justice when decency desired Davy to go down stairs but now we have liberty again to walk into her apartmentSit down good reader you are very welcome the young lady is pretty well recovered a serenity beams upon her brow there is not the least print of affliction's footsteps to be seen upon her countenance  But this calmness was not owing either to the affected pedantry of school stoicism called philosophy which honest teague who never read a page of Seneca so well defined by say∣ing by  Jasus I am born to be unhappy so I'll make myself very easy about the matter  Neither was the young lady of so callous a constitution as to be easily reconciled to the departure of her gallant by the method which the present females of intrigue make use of viz immediately to throw themselves in the way of anotherno this happy restoration was ef∣fected by that neverfailing Nostrum Nants Brandy Q S  Miraculous specific blush blush ye diplo∣mists of Gresham ye who pretend to understand things asico for your knowledge pound all the Materia Medica together in a mortar can ye compose such a mental Succedaneum Behold reader the two young ladies and mark with what courteous words the visiting lady ad∣dresses the lady visited  Mrs  Shred  My dear Samly take t'other pinch it will do your head good Thus kindly did my taylor's daughter console her companion untwisting at the same time her paper of rappee  Mrs  Justice  Call me not Samly dear crea∣ture I conjure you I detest the name Oh Miss Shred what woman would ever put her trust in man  Mrs  Shred  Curse on um indeed my dear man is as the poet says  Deceitful as the vind  Therefore woe be to the woman who has imbibed any fond ideas for Wits or Players or such sort of Geniusses  Curse me if ever Wit did any good to man woman or child since the invention of clean linnenAs to WIT'S perdition catch such scrubsthey behave as bad to their ladies as they do to one another  They'll never give an absent friend a good word or allow a girl a second gown to see com∣pany in  Miss  Shred's  Story  YesI must confess a wit was the first man who really had me that is critically speaking possessed my soul as to my person that was merely passive in all those other con∣nections to which my interest made me submit because as I was then upon the town and my inclinations not being engaged with my em∣braces I was as indifferent to the performance as an actress when she plays a part don't please her  In London madam there are men as well as women on the town and they go by the names of Wits and Droles and Cleverfellows and Choice Spirits whether they give these titles to themselves or other people call them so its no matter but they are sent for into company to divert people of fashion with what they can do just as girls are I mean madam in the way of singing and saying comic things and telling stories  It is a shame though men should expose them∣selves so because they are all of them bred to trades and might get their livings honestly and decently if they were not a set of lazy meanspirited and conceited fellows  Now when any of our sex is blasted it is all up with us we are unhappy enough to be reduced to the necessity of going into company or starving no body will employ us in an ho∣nest way because a girl who is forced to be a whore for her livelihood is looked upon espe∣cially  by all good christians to be the most con∣temptible creature upon the face of the earth  I sent a card to one of these wits and geni∣uses to sup with me the consequence of which you may naturally suppose we went to bed together Really I loved him infinitely for he was not only vastly clever but immensely odd and that you know takes with our sex im∣moderately  But he soon behaved as all such sort of peo∣ple will horridly ingrateful For after I had paid all his debts they were not large indeed because no shops would give him much credit new cloathed him and put money in his pocket he used meas surlily as if I had been his wife had I really been married to him he cou'd not have treated me worse  The word fool fool was perpetually his an∣swer not only to me but to all his acquain∣tance we were all fools he swore and yet in the whole fifteen months of our cohabitation tho' he called every body bockheads yet he never did one rational or just thing but by chance he could repartee drolely tell very high stories argue charmingly upon all subjects make songs as fast as I could cut out cappatterns but his words and his deeds were no more alike than the sign of a dolphin and a real one  He once wrote a book in praise of neatness in dress of elegace and of decency he was three weeks about it and in all that time never washed his hands face or teeth once Cleanliness or dirt was all the same to him money or no money only let him but get into company 'was all he cared for when he had no money he was tossed into the reckon∣ings  when he got three or four guineas he threw it away and he would sooner sit without shifting himself for a fortnight in a night cellar if he had no body left that he could make laugh but link boys than be regular to the bounds of decency and domestic enjoyments  He grew so overbearing at last so irregular and so obstinate that I could not bear it he scorned to be talked to and too proud to say he had ever been in the wrong he was in∣deed as all wits are irresolute and froward as a baby giddy as a drunken man absent as a lunatic as difficult to be pleased as a vex∣ed ideot and conceited as an Opera Singer  Oh my dear never have any thing to do with your geniuses unless you can get one of them now and then to write a song upon you for that very often helps a lady to many a good friendbut for all that I never would have any connection with such sort of sparksas to granting a man that made a good song upon me a favour  ang passawnt  as the French say I should not mind itbut don't never dear crea∣ture be fond of themnothe only men worth a lady's notice are those gentlemen who have no wit indeed but then they have what is better than all the wit genius and understand∣ing in the worldand what most commonly wit genius and understanding never have any thing to do with and that is MONEY  Money  my dear Let but a lady have thatand she is sure of having doing saying and being just what she pleases  The next person to whom I was predestinated happened to be neither a wit nor a scholar ne∣vertheless he was both a genius and a gentleman because he was a gamester As daring as a lyon  he would as soon draw his sword as his snuffbox and was as quick as volatile salts  He valued his honour before any other consi∣deration in the way of playing any game at cards or dice for he would sooner venture his life than be found out so careful was he of his honour You can't imagine how polite he was and what fine company he kept although as I told you he could hardly write his name or spell a word of two syllables but a gentleman's being ignorant of letters is no proof against his politeness for really I believe it would go very hard with some folks of the best company if they were to be examined concerning their reading and writing  Miss  JUSTICE  Very true indeed miss but thank God per∣sons in polite life are two well bred to be pedants and I would no more ask any fine gentleman or lady after their scholarships than I would after their religion because both the one and the other's out of fashion now  Miss  SHRED  Well madam my friend did such things in the moneywinning way and with such graceto be sure he lived like a nobleman and mantained me like a dutchess I had my equi∣page all upon gilded springs and I used to scorn all low bred persons as I called them for walk∣ing a foot because as my friend used to tell me nobody never need be poor if they had but a spirit to do things for if people wanted luck they should make it or else be punished with poverty for their faintheartednessBut  for all that what by the law or by one thing or another we dwindled to be obliged to live in a two pair of stairs backroom madam as you may do now and I can't but say we used to sit and think ourselves very ill done by Provi∣dencebecause why should we be poor when we took as much pains in the proper way of getting fortunes as ever any people did who got estates as the fashion is now to get them Well madam at last we parted and he married a methodist's widow with l a year join∣ture and I engaged myself as a figure dancer at the Opera House because I was told a lady had a better chance there of being taken into keeping than at the English Playhouses But I did not find the Opera people's taste so eager at intriguing with any of our sex as I expectedO curse that Italy my dearbut no more of thatI grew very low and I sent to my late friend who had married the methodist's widow for a guinea and his answer was truly he had done with all the vanities of this life and so should I and that he would advise me not to look after money but go and seek the Lord  Miss  JUSTICE  But who am I to seek who'll seek me  Miss  SHRED  Nay as to that madam never despair re∣member what is said to you in the letter about your landlord DavidI am sure it may be easi∣ly brought about for him to marry you I have so often heard him say what would he give for such a wife as you  Page  th  Case  Miss  JUSTICE  But dear creature would it not be immense∣ly shocking and absurd in mein me to de∣scend from being an actor's nay a manager's mistress and become a chairman's wifeperish that thoughtcan I bear it can I dear Miss Shred can I who came from a gentleman's family Yes madam my papa was a counsel∣lor at law he was prosecuted for his merit per∣secuted for the superiority of his talents and banished from his native country by faction but I am his own daughter and can I ever agree to have these arms filled with any body who is not a gentleman born or who is not so by profession or is not a person of consequence ay consequence that was what my deceiver Samly used to insist upon his consequence but why should I mention him or any other belonging to the stage I who have suffered by my fatal connection with an actor O that the world was all in flames that final destruction might seize on all since I am deceived de∣serted Farther she could not proceed for her friend fearful least her companion should re∣lapse into fresh grief snatched up the pewter measure in a moment in which was one re∣maining cordial draught and holding it to Chloe's lips insisted on her not making any more words but drink it off  CHLOE  Wiping her lips  Dear Shred you are so immensely kind that to convince you of my esteem I will be ruled by you and marry this horrid creature nay I'll do more for from henceforth I bid  adieu to all high life't ideas to the fond charms of even dear intrigue  Miss  SHRED  Miss Justice you should not make rash vows consider my dear you are a gentlewoman and many gentlewomen marry only for the sake of intriguing we should use the sex as that sex ought to be used I would always chuse the man who I fancied most properest for my in∣terest to be my husband and then chuse the man whom I most fancied for my lover  CHLOE  But how dear creature am I sure that as this odd mortal this David my landlord now he knows I was only Samly's mistress how am I sure I say that he will have me for a wife and upon my soul I would sooner die than de∣rogate so far from the dignity of my birth and my principles of honour as to live with any man but a gentleman without being married to him  Miss  SHRED  As to that my dear you are vastly in the right on't and our sex ought to be as strict in keeping up our consequence in that point as any or more than any other but as to the landlord's knowing of your having an affair to be sure although he is but a chairman yet he is a Welshman and he might perhaps have too much spirit had he not lived so many years at this end of the town as to know that it is fashionable and what is fashionable you know must be polite Besides my dear not one of  his companions dare to hit him in the teeth with it if he was to marry you for fear of offend∣ing one or other of their best customers  CHLOE  I am determined but at the same time am as determined to avoid even the appearance of intrigue what other ladies of taste and delicacy do shall be no rule for me to go by I will be true to my husband my honour and myself nor ever again grant any other man save him an involuntary embrace  The next week's sun saw her blazon'd in the matrimonial installation With how much firmness of soul she maintained her resolution of chastity will be expressed in some of the suc∣ceeding chapters In the conclusion of this I hope the reader will give me leave to observe that though like Miss Shred ladies may be women of the town and actresses at the same time and that there are some females belong∣ing to the Theatres who now publickly act in both capacities yet so far from being a reproach it is the greatest argument which can be brought in support of the profession of a player for although the want of chastity like the want of money may make some people ap∣pear but in an indifferent light yet according to the times neither of them have any thing to do at present with the respect which is paid to the accomplishments of genius  SCENE MATRIMONY  ON the weddingnight after the raptures of enjoyment between Mr and Madam Llwhyddwhudd were evaporated when every heartfelt thrill and throb of desire subsided each fine string of delight which had been ex∣tatic stretched by imagination's apparatus let down into a philosophic relaxation the new married pair lay back to back The lady being most restless was considering whether it would or would not offend the rules of delicacy if she was once again to turn to her husband  Her spouse was then debating since he had married so good a cook and so notable a wo∣man about making his house a public one which he did the winter following and had great business among the best people in the neighbourhood his spouse being so obliging a landlady occasioned the famous TRIPE AND TROTTER CLUB to be instituted at Mr Llwhyddwhuydd's  THE TRIPE AND TROTTER CLUB was the original of all the other Clubs now existing in this metropolis From thence came the famous Beefstake Clubs the Whist Clubs the Oxcheek Clubs the Jockey Clubs the Hornpipe Clubs the Peasoup Clubs the Choice Spirit Clubs the Spirituous Liquor Clubs the Poli∣tical Clubs the Philosophical Clubs the Roast∣ing Clubs the Punning Clubs the Spouting Clubs the Kept Misses Clubs and the Club of Discontents  David as he began to get money grew asthmatical and potbellied not breathing so freely as he was won't to do it frighten'd him like the rest of the wealth accumulating part of mankind he was terrified at the thoughts of dying therefore sent for a physician immedi∣ately  Reader you must have known such persons who while they worked for their living were useful members to society but when by chance or craft they become masters of money as∣sumed a haughtiness of behaviour abandoning themselves to a vitiated state of idleness and gluttony The event is their being seized with a complication of infirmities which in their active and praiseworthy state they felt not they hurry to a doctor give five guineas for ad∣vice in hopes to have a worthless carcase sheath∣ed from the worms which was it to continue on the earth for twenty years longer would not be of five shillings use to any of its fellow creatures  David by his physician's order was to re∣turn to his former trade this he had entirely left off his soul as he said being always ra∣ther above such an employment but when health is concerned when a life is to be saved by it although a lady or gentleman may have ever so good a spirit to be sure upon such considerati∣ons they must give way according to Sir John Falstaff's aphorism  Honour must be hid in necessity  While Mr David was putting himself once more into chaircarrying exercise some soldiers were ordered to be quartered in his neighbour∣hood  and Corporal Knott brought a billet for himself to Mrs Llwhyddwhuydd's  The Corporal was a gentleman remarkable for his gallantry he had had as many fine wo∣man as any general officer he was form'd for intrigue and graced with every accomplishment which could undo the fair  He sung all the songs in the Beggars Opera he could speak ten Tragedy love speeches could dance a hornpipe shew tricks with cards balance a lady's fan upon his nose no gentleman could fill a teapot more gracefully or swear more often or more agreeably then he wore his hat so smartly bluff and his hair was powdered so smooth could he have been but as constant as he was lovely Yet as no man is perfect he affected to imitate his betters and boast of his amours  It is natural for one hero to take another for his pattern he chose Alexander the Great for his it was the Macedonians frailty to glory too much in his conquests which Arrian could no more excuse in the son of Philip than I can in Corporal Knott  He though admired by the fair was disliked by his brother subalterns especially the veterans who hagged by winter campaigns their faces weatherworn and scarified did not like to see him look so plump so pert so smooth∣faced and wear his linnen so well ironed when they who had endured all the inclemency of every hard season in the tented and untented fields of unhospitable Germany who reflected that at the time they were thus fighting their country's battles instead of wearing nice plaited linnen had not any linnen to plait and half a  dozen brave British battallion boys who scorned to turn their backs upon double the number of French fellows though all beruffled and chit∣terlin'd yet all  their  linnen would not set up a tinder merchant  They snarled at this beau Corporal swear∣ing he was not fit for any service but just to make one in an officer's guard at the Operahouse  Often have I heard these noncommissioned heroes as they have limped alongthat de∣fect in their gait proceeding either from the wounds received in battle or from the neglect of not being dressed after the fight or from in∣curable contractions or relaxations the fatal ef∣fects of being exposed to the scorching heats and sudden damps of Africa and America and to the severity of wintering in illprovided quar∣ters on the banks of the Rhine the Weeser the Lippe c c for which perhaps Fle∣mish and Dutch commissaries * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * I was present at the disputation which old  Winterness  had with Corporal  Knott  on this subject which with the reader's leave we'll insert because if it is not a story it is a dialogue and as it is a dialogue it will be a means of displaying a copperplate exhi∣bition of an old warrior and a junior fine gen∣tleman or more properly to explain the print it is a contrast between the  Charms  of  Peace  in Mr Knott's figure and the  Fortune  of  War  in the old soldier's portrait  At the valiant tooper the altercation happen∣ed old Winterness was relating in the Corpo∣ral's  company all the engagements he had been in fighting all his battles o'er and o'er again and marking with a stick upon the sand of the alehouse kitchen the marches and counter∣marches of our armies dwelling with emphasis on the spot where he had received a shot or lost a limbThere my boys just there where I put my foot now there I stood on the left of the Scotch greys and had these two cuts on my skull and as it mought be here I had these three wounds and supposing now these pieces of pipe to be our front line as I was to the right of the royal a musquet ball took me in flank and went through both my thighs and there Sir as I was running after the French Pollavousees I lost the use of my right eye and Sir supposing this fullpot now to be Bocachica castle there I stood while we were attacking it and here it was that I left my arm and leg at Cartagenah But what then I don't think much at it not I I have gained honour and glory enough for an honest manI know what it is to serve my country and so here's his Majesty King George's health and all his family and Old England for everand as to my limbs why they're welcome to um as welcome as I am to this tobacco of my own buying  This limblosing conversation was foreign to the Corporal's thoughts he had been bred up in polite and delicate principles which was di∣ametrically opposite to such gothic customs al∣though several people of birth lately have been mad enough to relapse into their forefathers rusticity and not mind the sun's spoiling their complexions nor different climates having any  Page  th  effect upon their constitutions and have been as cool amidst batteries broadsides pitched battles and forts storming as if they were only dancing minuets at an assembly in England Yet the Corporal did not exceedingly relish such maiming honours for in his days fighting for one's country was not made such a fashion among fine gentlemen as it is at present there∣fore he rejoiced that a peace had been so expe∣ditiously manufactured  Yet he was ready with a small sword to give any private gentleman satisfactionbe∣cause that was fighting upon honour which no person of honour could refusebut fighting for one's country may be refused because you may haveorororororc c Knott unwilling that  Old Chelsea  should win all the applause of the company interrupted the scarfurrowed gre∣nadier observing that a man might run as many risques be in as many dangers at home as abroad and to prove it related his intrigues with several fine women  First he recounted the hair breadth scapes to get  Miss Neatsfoot  the tripeman's daughter off how he scaled the back garret how he knock∣ed down the watchman and how the town was obliged to him for bringing so accomplished a girl upon itthus the Corporal went on It was I that gave that girl the first idea of acting  I ust to tell her  how the first time she got into grand keeping she must persuade her friend to speak to some of the managers about letting her come upon the Stage because I know that's common ay and it's grown a scheme too among several gentlemen about town to get  rid of their women that way for when a girl grows stale upon their hands and they want to part with her genteely without being a settlement out of pocket by her why then these gentle∣men will call on one or other of the ma∣nagers and so in a sort of halfasking favour∣way they will tell the proprietor that there is a fine woman of their acquaintance who they know will be of service in the Playhouse and taking the patentee by the hand the'll say come set the girl down in the list pon honner I shall take it immensely kind I know you won't refuse me what's forty or fifty shillings a week out of your pocket besides I am sure she'll earn it And this is the way that we have women of the town belonging to the Theatres  Then continued the Corporal there was  Bett Filbert  she was the best drest fruit girl a∣bout St James's marketI beat the reform∣ing rascals for her no woman of quality though she had ever so fine a silk stocking and diamond shoebuckle on could show a neater leg and foot then Bett's was with her silver clasps red clocks and pinned up petticoats and as to an elegant and polite manner of doing things who ever opened oysters with more affa∣bility then Bett or made a hotpot with more taste then she did  Then there was  Waste Butt  the publican's widow I spent about five and forty pounds of her money only she grew too fond and when once a woman begins to behave so its fulsome and what no man of true delicacy can bear I was obliged therefore to leave her and got  cherrycheeked Judy  that used to lisp at Bucking∣hamgate  can o'milk Sir  I was private then  my officer made me a corporal for her I a'nt the first gentleman I suppose who has made his fortune by women nor come to preferment by giving up his mistress  Winterness  Who had sat chewing the cud of disappointment to be cut off in the concatena∣tion of all his glorious recitals and by a smock∣faced boy too as he muttered to me rose up like Ajax boiling with rage and casting his eyes upon the Corporal he burst out with  Why then Sir I must tell youthat a man of honour Sir striking his fist at the same time against his waistcoat breast buttons a man of honour Sir would as soon sell his king as his mistress A soldier let me tell you Sir would as soon desert from his post or run away from his colours as give his girl up I have been among the beauties in my time Sirbut before I would surrender my wo∣man to a general officer's summons I'd be drummed out of the regiment for cowardice and as to advancement I have got Chelsea honestly I never won preferment by pimping  Corporal  D'ye call me pimp Sir  This dispute would certainly have grown se∣rious had not the Editor of this work started up between themwhispered Knott that he saw a fine girl pass by the sash window and give the Corporal a beckon away skipped Knott and I begg'd old Winterness to be pacified and that I would bring him half a pound of the best pigtail next sunday  This pleased the veteran he shook the Editor heartily by the hand promised him never to mind any more fools for the future swore when he dyed he would leave me all his papers if I  would promise him to write the history of an old soldier  It is necessary we should return to the other personages of our dramatical copperplate histo∣ry and consider to what purpose Corporal Knott was introduced into this narration with regret I record it but Madam Llwhyddwhuydd for all her resolutions fell in love with him  Sometimes a lady's vows like French treaties are not to be relied onthey are like hasty made acts of parliament which the cunning of conv  niency can always find means to evade Besides when love is in the case nay when money for love and money are like a principle in mechanics which acts equal and contrary Love is equal in its power of action to money but contrary in its effects for as money will make persons blind to every thing but their own interest love will make persons see every thing but their own interest And with this mechanical metaphysical tritical critical and analytical disquisition proper it is to finish this scene of the drama  The  CHOICE SPIRITS FARCE  There is somewhat vastly significant not only in the reputation of being a soldier but also in a soldier's reputation which made Madam Llwhyddwhuydd as soon as ever the Corporal came with his billet to her house regard him with an eye of complacency  But when she heard what a number of wo∣men he had ruined she could not take her eyes from him not being able to imagine what he possessed so extraordinary that made so many  Page  ladies fall in love with himand as we know curiosity has as sudden and violent effect upon the frame of a fine woman as an hysteric she determined to be satisfied  The Corporal conceived a most violent incli∣nation for her from the moment he was con∣vinced her husband was a monied man and that she bore the purse  He immediately opened his trenches with a love speech made regular approaches by squeezing her hand planted his battery of ogles against her and quickly found he had a friend in the garrison which determined him to make one general assault by a billet doux that he re∣solved should be in the most elegant manner and concluded to have a song wrote upon her  He enquired among the Choice Spirits who then held their meetings like the primitive christians by stealth the reforming constables carrying on terrible prosecutions against them he found them at the cat and bagpipe in Rosemarylane after declaring upon honour he was no informer and owning his business he was inducted to the president whom you see in the print one George Alexander Stevens and who was recommended to the Corporal as a songwriter  Stevens received sixpence from him as earn∣est for it was a rule which the poets of that club had made to always have half the money down and the president declared he would write the song as soon as ever the disputation was over which the gentleman's entrance had put a stop to  The argument was warmly supported by the two altercators Stevens and Harry Howard the  assman concerning essential qualities George insisted the only acquisitions which could con∣stitute human happiness were temperance sta∣bility and propriety of behaviourHarry on the contrary swore that there were no ac∣complishments worth a man's while to be master of except good breeding and a good educati∣on This dispute would have lasted much longer had not a headborough opened the door and producing a warrant against Harry Howard for scurrility took away one side of the argu∣ment  A sheriff's officer would have carried off the other he came there with a thieftake's dog fearful of a rescuebut least the thread of our history should be snapped too soon we shall turn over this cause and arrest to the chapter entitled the art of bailtaking orthebyLondonand Westminster  All gentlemen performers in the pen and ink way of songmaking must acknowledge it is extremely unlucky when the lady's name whose person they are to celebrate won't make a proper rhime  The number of pretty ballads which are sung every summer season at all publick places of entertainment would lose one part of their merit were it not for the name jingle which so aptly terminates every stanza such as  Kitty Downs  And Zouns  Miss Apple  And Couple  Polly Savage  And Cabbage  Love Miss Harriot  And Judas Iscariot  What then could a songmaker do with Llwhyddwhuydd had he not cunningly sup∣plied that defect by versifying her Creolian name Chloe and fitted up so tasty a lovesong for the Corporal that Mr Knott taking the bard by the hand swore had he had any more money about him to signify he would have made George a handsome present over and above what he agreed with him for however the military man's spirit was so great and he was so well pleased with the verses that he slipped the re∣maining change of sixpence into the poet's hand which was all Knott had after paying for a tankard of porter the entrance fee which every body subscribed according to the rules of the room before they could be admitted ho∣norary members  The Editor of this undertaking cannot be so ingrateful as to suffer such a noble action of the Corporal's to slip without taking proper notice of it  To the  most Noble most Worthy most  c c c  Ye great men of many manors who at this present writing can chuse your taverns and pay a ready money reckoning for every dainty you call for while I twirling my mutton before an illsupplied fire am stretching the elasticity of my invention to its utmost pitch how to ob∣tain upon credit one single beer and beer libati∣onOh would ye but imitate this generous soldier's behaviour and bestow upon the artists you employ a premium for their merit But artists perhaps would think themselves happy  could they instead of being paid overplus only receive the prices they agreed for  But laments are vain the labourers of genius and the lollers in a coach and six are no more analogous than politics and plaindealing  Honestly and  bona side  I speak if they do call me names I can't help it but ⅝ of all the rich people in England were it not for their money would have no more sense no more wit no more taste no more generosity no more hu∣manity no more learning no more affability nor more of any more mores than we have who are obliged to mind our books to make the pot boil  Yet writers who pretend to satyrise rich folks are to blame nor should any pen and ink dealers call the expectants and dependants of wealthy men who are known by the name of toadeaters to an account for their behaviour  To be sure the members of the toadeating club will give his honour vast applause if his honour says but any thing bordering upon com∣mon sense and they will also lift up their hands and eyes with theatrical astonishment if her ladyship should make an observation pertinent to the subject and extol the vastness of their pa∣tron's capacities Now I cannot see any flat∣tery in all this for it is wonderful considering rich peoples education The ductility of their tutors the venality of their menials and the libertinisms they are indulged in how they can ever say think or do any thing to the purpose  Heirs to great fortunes are born as well mind∣ed very often as the poorest tenant's child un∣der them but the understanding of the eldest  hope of great families is either totally neglect∣ed or else cultivated in an improper manner  The reason why men of genius are so seldom rewarded by men of fortune is because men of fortune don't understand genius therefore rich people are more proper objects for pity than satire It is the want of having their minds justly improved by arts and sciences which makes them such strangers to the happiness of know∣ing what to do with their time  To be a man of fashion they think is the excellence of perfection or they would not la∣vish such vast sums for the encouragement of grooms gamblers prostitutes and rareshows when so many works of public utility become abortive and so many artists pine away for want of the hand of bounty to bring them to life for the service of their country  Is it not a shame that in so noble a nation as England renowned throughout the world for arts and arms the major part of those who should set a better example only exhaust them∣selves and their fortunes in an eternal round of visits cards auctions foreign fidlers and balladsingers  As to balladsingers and balladmakers the difference is trifling in regard of their merit but the reward is not proportionable This Stevens to my knowledge has wrote upwards of songs yet never was so well paid for any nay for all the rest as for that one he made the Corporal  The  POET'S BILL  Received as earnest for making a love song upon Madam Chloe to consist of four verses        Paid the remainder of my demand as soon as I had finished my work        Received overplus or by way of premium        Sum total for Poetry        All the rest of this man's songs I am certain the weight of paper excepted would not now sell for so much money  For the entertainment of the curious we in∣sert the verses that Mr Knott bespoke printed from the author's original copy  And as this song comprehends all that has been or can be comprehended in the compo∣sition of lovesongwriting according to the method at present of the public garden poets the Editor presumes this may serve as a pattern or measure for all future amorous stanza ma∣kers to cut out their works by who intend to write for the amusements of the summer parties that swarm from Ranelagh Rotunda to the New Tunbridge  A New SONG  Call'd CHLOE LLWHYDDWHUYDD An lambic Sapphic and Lyric  by  G A Stevens  Embellished with Notes by  H Howard  Esq  Author and Etcher in Ordinary  STROPHE I  DOWN the Parnassian heights I soar  Upon Pegasus' back my fancy I bore  Bright Phoebus with Apollo here attend  Be all ye Muses nine the poet's friend  A Poet as I'll show ye  From France to Philadelphia's climes  No haberdasherer of rhimes  Can boast a Toast like Chloe  Notes on the first Verse  Soar and Bore  Some people say those two lines are rather false grammar and it should be that Pegasus bore but I say whatever bad grammer they may be they are good rhimes and as Mr Skeggs and Mr Massy both observed that is the most materialest thing in a song because there are very few singers nowadays who will let you know whether they sing sense or non∣sense So for that reason I never troubled my head with what I published in that respect  H H  Phoebus and Apollo  Phoebus signifies the sun according to the dictionary and Apollo is said to be the God of physic and poetry So a person said last night that was the reason why rhimewritings were generally called drugs and also why a great deal of poetry was used in physical operations  Philadelphia  That word was put in because the lady was born in the West Indies  STANZA I  She is notyes she is compleat  Her alablaster iv'ry teeth so neat  Her eyes like starry suns all hearts illume  And Zephyrus whistling sighs her lips perfume  Where is her marrow know ye  Her cheeks are cochineel'd her breasts  Are Cupid's kettledrums and love's birds nests  That Venus builds for Chloe  NOTES to the second Verse  She is not  The word  not  is a pun upon Corporal Knott's name Your critics that know no better will call out about false spelling but I never mind that I can write songs for all them or that either  Alablaster and Ivory  These words are two similes to describe whit∣nesses and clearnesses  Like Starry Suns  Poets may do what they will with nature make stars suns and suns stars because we have the  poetica licentious  for it  Her Marrow  That is a Yorkshire word and signifies an equal or a person upon the same footing as yourself introducing such obsolete words gives the poem a true pastoral turn and as it is in∣tended to be sung in an evening in the music loft among the lamps and trees it ought to have some out of town allusions in it  Her Cheeks Cochineel'd  One of the best lines the thought is mine but it's wrong spelt it should be  scutchineel'd  be∣cause scutchineel is a better red than vermilion and takes its name from the herald painters first using it in painting scutcheons  The simile of scutchineel also signifies that as those insects are never used but after their death so her cheeks would not lose her colour until after she is dead  Cupid's Kettledrums  That's a double ontender and  love's birdsnests  another and without such things a song  won't fell I told the author I would etch him a headpiece to this song about the  bird's nest  because what sells so well as smutty pictures now especially with a dash of politics in them and politics is easy brought in any howtruly Mr George said he would not offend decen∣cy  then people are damnably deceived in you  thought I but as I told him why George says I is there not a great many tradesmen freemen of the city of London men well to pass and masters of families who are not a∣shamed to have their sashwindows filled with bawdy blackguard prints and why should you then trouble your head about it I'll answer we could get money by it and as long as a man can but do that and not go to Newgate why it does not signify what he does and as to de∣cency I despise it for I have always got a good living thank God without it However George woud'nt consent so I set him down obstinate  STROPHE  encore  Tempests I'll tear up

pay I'll lay the odds  That nothing ne'er beats Chloe  NOTES to the third Verse  Tear up Tempests by the Root  This is a figure in poety signifying that the earth shall pull her hair about her ears in a passion Trees are often said to be in songwriting the locks of hair of the world's head  To  BOOT  There's a fine word for a pun and fine punc have been made about it and now I don't care who knows it but I have done more of those pieces of wit than any one else they were all afraid but I was like a true gamester I went nothing to something I knew I cou'dn't be worse and if they did take me up I was sure to be a great man as long as I lived because I should have suffered martyrdom for my wit and humour  Galaxy  There is no such a word at least not that I know off I askt the author and he told me it was the mosaic pavement of Jupiter and Juno's gallery but I was not to be hummed so for what business has Moses with Heathen Deities not that I know any thing about religion I would as soon make a song about  Moses  as I did about  Zebra  if I could get as much money by it  The Synagogue of Gods  This signifies something about parsin Whit∣field and his tabernaclepeople but what the author won't tell me  Play or Pay lay the odds Nothing never beats Chloe  This is the true verbatum language used by sporting men at all the meetings in England Scotland and Ireland  STANZA  encore  When time's sharp scythe mows down my breath  Shall I not in my quick expiring death  In tinkling rills her murmuring whispers hear  While she like eccho sobbing sighs my dear  Oh Corporal where go ye  Revived I'll rush into her arms  And ravish all her curling charms  And charm my charming Chloe  NOTES to the fourth Verse  Times Scythe mowing down his Breath  Is a fine metaphor and to be met with or something to the same purpose in almost all the love songs for many years past  Eccho sobbing  Because eccho Mr Littleton in his dictionary says she sighed herself into a consumption  Charm my charming Chloe  That I will venture to say is one of the most charming lines that I or Shakespear ever made There was as I have heard say a critic once a learned man his name was  Villager  or  Sca∣lisher  or some such a foreign phrase and he said that there was one of Horace's songs which he had rather been the author of than been a king without a rag on  This is as I ve heard the story  and now I say I did'nt care if I could but have wrote that line and  charm my charming Chloe  if I was to be reduced to my former state and have nothing but rags on  SCENE  the  OVERTHROW  Home hasted the Corporal with the copy of verses and gave them the lady wrapped up as he received them from the author She hurried into her own room with the pacquet imagining it was some very pretty present but when it was unwafered and it appeared to be only a paper filled with written hand which she could not read one syllable Mrs Llwhyddwhuydd suffered the most cruel agitation of spirits that ever any lady was thrown into who by the sudden whim of spouse or papa was prevented from being punctual to the moment of assigna∣tion  She supposed the letter to be an appoint∣ment the Corporal gone to the rendevouz and had left her that as a direction where to follow him How did she then lament her not being booklearned she fretted sighed stamp∣ed  called on her stars on the Corporal and fate  The maid passing by the door heard the outcry run down to Mr Knott beckon∣ing him into the back kitchen asked him what he had done to her mistress for that as how her mistress was in the most wonderful conster∣nation about the Corporal and what he had wrote in a paper  Knott who had been Bajazet like enjoy∣ing though but in fancy his scheme and what an opinion his landlady must have of him and how fine a fellow she must think him to be able to write so fine a song was struck as flat with what the girl said to him as a new actor just hissed  It occured to him on the instant that the versemaker had hummed him and instead of the song he had paid for had palmed some other paper on purpose to make the lover look like a fool and Knott muttered  damm these wits they are always full of mischief especially against their best friends however I'll break the rascal's bones  Unluckily for some parties George the bal∣ladcompiler then was passing along on the other side of the way the military man had a view of him and through the entry Knott burst into the street after the scribbler  Passion or anger will as effectually dazzle persons eyes as interest Mr Knott by rage was so dimsighted that as he sprung from the threshold he saw not a sedan which David and his partner were bearing by with a fair in it  Against its side rushed the Corporal and down came the chair shattering upon the pave∣ment The glasses were smashed the sash frames shivered and the soldier tumbling over the top of it rowled into the channel calling out as he lay  oh Stevens I  ll do for you  George Alexander hearing a threatning voice imagining it to be a bailiff's started off fast as fear could wing his feet and like an expe∣ditious fine porter running to his duty overset every one who stood in his way  The first person who fell a victim to the ve∣locity of the poet's fears was  Wellfleet Betty  standing on the upper step of a cook's cellar with a basket full of goods upon her head one hand was rested upon her hip her elbow form∣ing the point of an angle and with the fingers and thumb of the other hand she was snapping defiance  The bard took her in flank rushing against her outstanding elbow the sudden shock turn∣ed her half round and backwards she pitched into the cellar just as Theo Cibber's property∣man was bringing up twelvepennyworth of soup and oxcheek  bouilli  for his master come∣dian's dinner  Down soused Betsy's head into the dish and her feet fell on each side of the young man's head upon his shoulders her weight returned him into the cellar and the broken baking pan the oxcheek the soup and the oysters cover∣ed the floor  Onward scampered George overturning Had∣dock's waiter who had a box full of jellies in his hands then the song scribbler met parrellel to his breast a mophandle which a wench was  twirling his force flung it in a diagonal direc∣tion down but the mop hit in its way the silk∣stockin'd shins of a French dancingmaster the blow brought  Monsieur Capriole  to the ground he pitched upon his face and his nose was flat∣tened against the pavement  The perpetrator of this mischief began to be scant of breath and turning his head as he ran to see where his pursuers were he threw down a salop stall  The vender of that diet drink had just served a dish to no less a chapman than the little poet DERRICK  the doer of Dryden's works  who not thinking of any thing was very innocently cooling his sassafras when the gross bodied bard like a collier running foul of a pleasure boat tumbled the small sized versifier into the dirt  The bulk of Mr Derrick's muff prevented him from being bruised but the blade of his pinchbeck hilted rapier snapped in the scabbard and the spray of the salop obliged the little gentleman to keep his bed until the scowerer had repaired the damage his laced coat and waist∣coat had sustained  Here the race ended the author of all these ills tumbling at the same time was seized by the woman to pay for what was broke spoiled and spilt  It is impossible to say what might have been the event of George's being detained since he always was inflicted with that terrible malady of  non sum solvendum  but Mr MACKLIN the the actor came by paid the cost and took Ste∣vens home promoting him to be his tutor  The putter together of Love Alamode  being at that time of day in the bloom of his youth  Page  th    not above thirtyfour years of age took to his learning prodigiously and in less than a week was able to make out every letter of the alphabet  The  COUCH SCENE  The person who happened to be in the chair when it was overturned was the very drole SAM FOOT  Esq  the greatest mimic genius in England who after much shrieking and struggling rose head and shoulders high betwixt the broken frame of the chairglass his face all scratched like a fresh blooded ghost ascending through the tragedy trap on his countenance pallid fear sat frightful his livid lips quivered with terror he begged help for God's sake and religiously reiterated his intreaties to the by∣standers  He had not at this time exhibited publickly any of his extraordinaries neither was he as yet determined to what part of the arts and sci∣ences he should devote himself  It was to this adventure and the advice of Miss Shred that the town has had the happiness of being entertained with his  Vis Oeuvres  After he was delivered from the chair and inducted into Mrs Llwhyddwhuydd's best one pair of stairs room Miss Shred who saw from her chamber the accident ran over to David's house fearful they had not politeness enough to accomodate so brilliant dressed a person as Mr Foot  Miss Shred insisted upon carrying up the ba∣son of water and towel to the gentleman Mr Foot received her with all that complai∣sance peculiar to himself and assured her both  in French and English that he was immensely obliged to her  Miss  SHRED  Sir a person of your appearance demands the most polite reception and as I am conscious the people of this house are too vulgar to use such a person as you are as you should be therefore I left my own house that I might pay a proper regard to one of your elegant ap∣pearance  Mr  FOOT  Madam you do me too much honour to be sure ma'am I conceive the inhabitants of this porterselling territory to be the quintessence of vulgarity My Ideas never before announc∣ed such a contemptible set of reptiles as those creatures were who helped me out of the chair one should not they say mock one's friends but upon my soul they were such a collection of grotesques that while they were doing me a great piece of service I could not help taking them off and the fellow who seemed to have the most humanity about him and was really very tender of me squinted his compassion with two such inverted eyes saying  I hope your honour cant hurt Sir  Miss  SHRED  I vow Sir that look was vastly like him but I am surprised Sir a gentleman of your accomplishments should seem to hesitate about taking off your friends it is the extreme wit  of the politest persons and which Sir you must know and if you was not to do it Sir it would be a loss to the world for you know Sir each individual admires to have an acquaintance nay all their acquaintance made ridiculous and I am persuaded no person can be more happy in that execution than yourself  Mr  FOOT  Madam I am embarrassed at this rencontre with a lady of your consummate penetration indeed madam I have been flattered by my friends with having an excellency in taking off my intimates and shall be proud of a lady of your sensations determining concerning the merit of my abilities  Immediately he went through the defects misfortunes and weaknesses of all his ac∣quaintance with immense spirit he took off Sir Harry's lady as she said her prayers at church mimicked her brother the judge in his passing sentence of death shook his head as my lord's uncle did who was paralytic from his infancy walked limping like Sir William who lost part of his heel in a seaengagement and then in the character of punch preached a fu∣neral sermon with such vivacity such humour and such naivetie that Miss Shred became transported backwards she fell in raptures upon the couch crying out bravo bravo bravo my dear creature  SCENE III  Miss  SHRED  and  SAM FOOT  Curtain up again  Miss  SHRED  UPON my honour Sammy you have reduced me to the most extraordinary cir∣cumstances of not being able to look at a gen∣leman without blushing and believe me Sir I never was guilty of such an action before but as Richard says  for this among the rest was I or∣dained  Mr  FOOT  Madam it is impossible for me to express how high an idea I entertain of a lady possessed of such a capability as I find you mistress of therefore I can do no less than dedicate myself to your service  Miss  SHRED  I accept your homage dear Foot and I give you my hand which acts equal with my heart and as I know your talents are as ex∣trordinary as you are pleased to observe my capabilities are surprising I will plan and you shall execute as I am conscious my concepti∣ons are perfectly picturesque  This it was on which Mr Foot laid the foundation of that grandeur we have several times seen him so amazingly arrive at To  Miss Shred he was obliged for the hint of giv∣ing tea by her he also was initiated into that species of wit and humour with which to this day he continues with so much originality to entertain the town  During this abovestairs conversation David was busied in picking up his chair's fragments the Corporal was upon foot pursuing the au∣thor but the soldier met his officer at the turn of a street who ordered him immediately to get ready and set out next morning for Corn∣wall  Knott though he was alarmed at the com∣mand knew his duty was to be silent and obeyBut took his resolutions accordingly as he had been hitherto successful in his schemes with the fair sex and that his time was so short he went upon the hunt for two of his com∣rades he could confide in  This was the reason that Madam Llwhydd∣whydd did not see her lover all that day although its certain no lady ever more longed that is she wanted to be satisfied and no person she was sure or at least she thought herself sure and that fancy with many ladies amounts to a certainty that no body could satisfy her so well as the Corporal  The damaged chair was sent to be repaired Mr Foot and his lady took coach for a coun∣try jaunt David having nothing else to exe∣cise himself with resolved to walk into Wap∣ping to see his brother on board of ship  His spouse who knew her husband would not be at home until four or five in the morning began to be vastly uneasy about the Corporal who made it evening before he returned  The guests withdrawn the maid hurried to bed just as the feeble watchman whistling in his sound came by coughing out paaaast o'clockMr Knott high in blood stole like Lothario unheeded to his dear Llwhydd∣whuydd's chamber he found the lady  loose unattir∣ed warm  I ashamed to say itbut  fuddled  absolutely  non compos  how it happened as well as so melancholy an accident can bear relating shall be disclosed  That night the lady went up stairs in charm∣ing spirits Mr Knott having received the wink of assignation while he sat below drinking with his comrades But alass unhappy gentlewoman reflecting perhaps too much on what might very naturally happen between her and the Corporal she grew immoderately thirsty in poetry we should express it  she was burning with desire  By mistake she put a bottle of brandy to her mouth which had in the hurry been put un∣corked where the waterbottle used to stand It was there placed by the maid the mistress's sud∣den coming up prevented the girl from any other ways disposing it  Mrs Llwhyddwhuydd's agitation of mind rendered her incapable of judging the differ∣ence until she had swallowed so large a gulph intoxication was the consequence By which the reader is deprived of one of those luscious descriptions which are now looked upon in the novel way the most essential embellishments for modern bookselling  Yet not to have our customers entirely dis∣appointed we present them with the lady asleep in one of those engaging attitudes so enticing  Page  to the  very  young and  very  old gentlemen of this metropolis who want to see pretty legs pretty feet pretty breasts and all must be very pretty  Masters under age are supposed to have raw and indigested ideas not being arrived at a pro∣per taste  Elderly lovers have outlived their's there∣fore both must be alike fed and their strength∣less appetites tempted by insubstantial garnish not having power to relish manly food  Mr Knott knowing by the orders he had received from the captain there was no time to spare took some pains to waken the lady and having recovered her so well as to acknowledge she loved no man like the Corporal he discover∣ed to her how he was pinched for time the lady fearing to lose her so very lately gained lover the force of liquor and power of the Corporal's arguments altogether corresponding made her consent that very night to go off with him The maid fast asleep in the garret the drawer dead drunk in the cellar and her hus∣band from home She packed up all the plate ready money and her best cloaths for that is an observation I have generally made that la∣dies who by stealth leave their husbands are determined that the loss shall be as severely felt as the time they have to accomplish their scheme will admit  It was by the help of Mr Knott's comrades every article was brought safe to the Fly in which the Corporal and his lady were convey∣ed without one accident to Portsmouth there the next morning by the greatest good luck they found a sloop going off for Plymouth in  which they embarked and in four days landed there then by easy journeys reached Cornwal to which the Corporal's rout was directed  Since we have conducted Mrs Llwhydd∣whuydd so far we'll let her rest a little after her journey and take a trip to London to inquire what became of her husband  The  DREAMING SCENE  David returned home the next morning a∣bout two hours after his unfaithful lady's elope∣ment but too much filled with his evening's excess to admit of any information until snor∣ing had evaporated some of those fumesbut the physical account of SNORING which was never before attempted is proper to intro∣duce here  To the Sapientifical Scientifical Celestial Maga∣zinemaker selftaught Philosopher Lecturer and Instrumentseller  To the Venerable Antigallicanist and Balsam of Life vender  To the most celebrated most advertised most graduated Ludgatehill Licentiate  And last though not least in character  To the Egregious consummate Doctor of all Doctori∣buses the Eccentrical Occulistical most superla∣tive Egotist Adventurer and Chevalier this Ela∣borate Essay is addressed  SNORING arises from the superabundancy of vapour collected the preceding night by drink and conversation treasured up in the storehouse or magazine of the head  The spirit of the liquor sublimates through the valves and ducts from the stomach and the froth or Aerial parts of disputes observati∣ons altercations and witticisms make their way thro' the auricular glands or organs at the same time into the cellulae of the brain These puffballs thus collected float about un∣til secretion I beg my friends of the faculty you'll observe this although it is out of the power of the College to account for animal se∣cretion  ergo  all physick is upon undetermined principles Yet I have assigned a ratio for the secretory officinal of dreams which are these puffballs composed as beforementioned and lodged in the tenements of the pineal glands just as infant maggots are housed  But when all the pia and dura mater apart∣ments are filled and not a single idea even for the good of self can be wedged in there will remain great quantities of this windy effluvia which the owner of the head has imbibed in the last day and night's exercise which must be dis∣charged charged before the proper disposed imaginations can have room to act  Therefore on a sudden fast issue through those windgates the nostrils the overplus of yesterday's retailings which can't be perform∣ed before sleep has for some hours set his draining engines at work and that is the reason why morning dreams are more to be relied up∣on than those before midnight The violence with which this stream rushes forth from the  head is the occasion of that sound which is equal to the diameter of the diapason of  but the solution of that question concerning the mathe∣matical proportion of major and minor semitones betwixt snoring and other eructations is sent for a prize answer to the Lady's Diary to which we refer the reader  After David had slept about five hours loud and sound the elastic coats of his brain began to exert their pulsations and he dreamed a dream which forboded mischief as plain as any dream ever repeated at breakfast by the polit∣est prettiest and most sensible maid wife wi∣dow or mistress you enjoyed a morning's tête a tête with or at least that you said you did  David did dream as how that the Tower of London was made of papier machée and that the French intended to undermine all our coal∣pits and so destroy the nursery of our seamen  Out of the seven or eight millions of Great Britain's inhabitants one million we may rea∣sonably suppose will read this book and that of those readers delight in the inter∣pretation of dreams for their emolument we shall explain this dream viz The Tower of London being made of chewed paper signifi∣ed that the affection of his wife which he thought permanent as the bulwarks which the mud and grass of tower ditch semicirculates was as insubstantial as the incoherent orna∣ments of waste paper and the French and the coalpits meant that a wicked enemy should undermine the navigation to his wife's heart  At noon next day David waked and with broad eyes foundbut by all rules of writ∣ing an author as well as a painter is to  allow his customers imagination fair play or game law therefore this part of the scene shall be left to the reader's conception How Mr Llwhyddwhuydd looked where he looked what he said when he could speak and how long it was before he returned to a capability of saying or seeing or doing any thing  Suppose yourself oh sympathizing reader in this afflicted husband's situation it is with some confusion that the Editor acknowledges him∣self rather abrupt in pretending to place any buyer or borrower of this volume upon the footing of a chairman All that we mean by begging the question is  most reverend most honourable  or  most handsome Sir  or  Madam  a possibility for what we call the finest person in England when angry to behave equal with the lowest To prove which I shall make an extract from a book called  The History of the human Mind  The three estates or different modes of the Soul's constitution are denominated highlife middlelife and lowlife  Those degrees when put into a passion act upon the same parallel and as you may have seen Mr Bayes's sun moon and earth dancing the hay so it is with these highlife shall be middle middle shall be low low high and they sometimes dance so much and so long that there is no distiction to be observed between them  But this only happens in very rare cases' viz in love in anger and in drunkenness  Furthermore it is said in this Book chap page I wish may it please your ho∣nour that you would either look a little more into it or suffer your eldest son to be a little better acquainted with it and I would bett a good name against great riches and that's ten pounds to a crown you know that if those personages who can read it would study it not thumb and dog's ear a drole place or two but go fairly and honestly through it they would be taught to think worse of themselves than they do at present and thereby become better for the future  There would every egotist discover  That his consequence was but conceit and judg∣ment merely opinion That FLATTERY is the universal language KNAVERY man∣kind's modus Conversation quibbling PUB∣LIC SPIRIT a riddle FRIENSHIP a phan∣tom and SELFINTEREST grand signior  Goodbreeding may be contaminated and greatness put in an extreme fury for such trifling things as an honest chairman would be ashamed to be out of temper about  And when the most polite are most angrily agitated they may and do often swear huff kick curse strike abuse break and bellow with such violence as if they were no more than a chairman or any other such illiberal beings And I beg leave to observe for all what the heralds office alledge to the contrary even her grace although deli∣cately dignified may be horridly chagrin'd if  she permits passion to gallop over the course with her  The unfortunate Mr Llwhyddwhuydd pre∣sently swore himself out of breath in hurrying backwards and forwards throughout the neigh∣bourhood to tell his sad story Vowed many rash vows and said many bad things When his friends found his anger was obliged for want of fresh spirits to subside and he was sufficiently relaxed to hear consolation they administered advice  gratis  As all English peo∣ple ought to do one among another the gene∣rality of my countrymen and women are apt enough to bestow their counsels even unasked in all casesnone but physicians and law∣yers making money of their words  They sell their advice as Lapland witches do wind only to make more mischief  His partner begged him to be comforted squeezing Mr Llwhyddwhydd by the brawny part of his thumb my dear David don't hurt yourself any more by grief I don't doubt but all will be well as ever and your spouse shall come home again and there will be no harm done and you will live hapyy to the end of your days and you must take example by your betters and forget and forgive as the Bible says  This speech gave David great cause of con∣templation and after he was in bed that night thus he soliloquised  In the name of God and St David can I ever in honour have my wife home again Am I not an ancient Briton Where then must I put my honour Is not my honour the seat of my heart and has she not given away her  honour and would she come home and take away my honour too now that damm dog of a soger has laid hold of her honour for himselfmore shame for him that any of King George's men should not have honour of their own  Not being able to sleep he went to his li∣brary and looking over the index of his ma∣gazines among those curious receptacles of the atoms of universal learning he found the fol∣lowing essay concerning  HONOUR  There is no KINGDOM STATE PRINCI∣PALITY PENINSULA CONTINENT ISTH∣MUS  We have endeavoured at the true magazine stile it may seem tautalogous but our readers must know the necessity those monthly productions lay under to make use of many words they like stage coaches being obliged to set out to their time full or empty  METROPOLIS CITY SUBURBS or ENVIRONS in or out of Christendom pos∣sesses so much honour as the town of London  Nor by the root of St David's leek  Mr Llwhyddwhuydd called out  no man in London has more honour than myself  To prove that London is the plenum of honour what man or woman can you meet with that will not declare themselves to be people of honour who can you converse with that will not assure you upon their honour  The Turks cannot be such civilised per∣sons as christians Therefore have no idea of honour and are strangers to duelling that custom of killing is only practised where the gospel is taught  However the mahometans have great honesty in respect of their meum and tuum dealings But that method of merchandiz∣ing is no more than an absolute sentiment which might do well enough for the moral law but the statutes and practices of the European courts being by revealed religi∣on more enlightened such infidels as Turks and heathens by not having the advan∣tages we christians have can never act so upright as we do  Laws honour equity and honesty be∣ing refined are to be consideredbut we refer the reader for a proper explication of those matters to our notes upon the Atha∣nasian creed  In Italy Spain and Portugal the na∣tives are extremely tenacious of their honour as they are also of their religion the two most noble practices of the soul  They are persons of superior honour and religion to the rest of Christendom which accounts why so many people are poison∣ed assassinated and put into the inquisition in those countries more than any others It is all done as that very painstaking Mr Hen∣riques observes to GLORIFY GOD and for their own honour  The French are not much bigotted to ma∣trimonial honour but they have very ro∣mantic ideas of glory and imagine that  glory is preferable to limbs health life and even the profits of a per cent usury  Nay so prone are our English people to follow French fashions that we have adopt∣ed this mode and such is the common cha∣racteristic of our country to improve upon every invention that a great many of our Britons have carried this glory much farther than ever the French dared they had a very fair trial for it lately and in spite of pol  ti∣cal jockeyship and though we were obliged sometimes to shift saddles and sometimes we could not go as we would yet we always came in for the sweepstakes  This was not satisfactory to Mr Llwhydd∣whuydd he did not understand any thing about glory all his care was about his honour and not meeting with an explanatory account in any of his volumes he arose next morning to consult an old acquaintance and country woman of his and one of the wisest people ever born for she was descended in a direct line from the child that Queen Sheba had by King Solomon Though she could not prove herself of one of the most ancient families yet for the greatness of her understanding the defect of birth was overlooked and she was made overseer of the weeders to a Welch gardener's at Lambeth  During the time of Mr David's walking to Mr Winifred ap Shingle and to make an end of this scene of our drama give me leave by way of tag to tell you an old story about honour  I do not doubt but you may have read it in every jest book I own the story is old yet like a true commentator I quote the ancient things to exhibit the antiquity of my reading  MAGRAH MONAGHAN of Connaught din∣ed one day with TERENCF O HARA in the queen's county Monaghan was every inch of him a gentleman and scorned to do a dirty thing But as necessity and honour are ever at seesaw with all gentlemen of no fortunes it happened at that instant Need was uppermost and gave an impelling or propelling quality to some of Mr Magrah's muscles  Astronomers are not yet clear enough in their accounts for us to ascertain which it was of the occult qualities innate to bodies that oc∣casioned a silver spoon before grace after meat was said to gravitate into Mr Magrah Mona∣ghan's pocket The thing was missed and his host very mildly taking his guest aside whis∣pered him  My dear Mac will you be telling me any thing of the spoon  MAC  Is it me you mean the Devil burn me into tinder ashes Terence if I know no more of the spoon than St Patrick  TERENCE  Well but don't you at all at all  MAC  Why then by the contents of this  catching up the mustard pot  I don't Would you be thinking I'd be telling you a LYE  TERENCE  But upon YOUR HONOUR don't you  MAC  MY HONOURBy Jasus there's  tak∣ing the spoon from his pocket  the vagabond spoon again and I'll tell you one thing Terence and that an't two I wouldn't forfeit my honour for all the spoons in the whole country of Christendom  ACT II  SCENE IV  Mr  Llwhyddwhuydd  and  Winifred ap Shingle  DAVID Llwhyddwhuydd went over West∣minsterbridge to consult Madam Wi∣nifred ap Shingle  After the proper ceremonials were adjusted of who should set down first what sort of a day it was and every other polite phrase which is used among the most delicate as an introduction to more interesting conversation David ac∣quainted Winifred with his misfortune and with his partner's saying he should have his wife home again and how continued Mr Llwhyddwhuydd can I do that with honour  for I do assure you Winifred that man is not worthy to carry a pair of straps upon his shoul∣ders who is not a man of honour For a chair∣man when his honour is gone is no more than a hackneycoachman or a waggoner or any other of those horsedriving rascals How then can I receive my wife againoh Wini∣fred you don't know what a fine creature she wasTo be sure her neck was as white as a damask napkinand the best people in the neighbourhood did use to send to by her pick∣lesand her cheeks were as red indeed as my new scarlet breechesand such a hand ay and for a pancake Winifred look youwell God bless her Majesty and all the ladies of honour but they could not toss one better to be sure Damm Ochee I will be the death of that damn'd dog corporal scoundrelIt was lovepowder which he did give her and he shall be taken up for poisoning my wife as sure as Sir Watkins is a gentleman  WINIFRED  You come to me for advice David look you indeed and do speak all yourselfbut you shall hear now in God's name  upon which she put her band before his mouth and bawled in his ear  you must take your wife again  He started from the chair his shoulders strik∣ing against Mrs Shingle's chin cast her back∣wards into a washingtub where she lay head and knees bent together her legs hanging over the edge while he regardless of his country∣woman's condition swore a horrid oath with as much solemnity as ever the finest gentleman  gave himself to the devil at a hazardtable but stamping at that moment on poor Winifred's cat Grimalkin fixed her teeth and claws so fu∣rious in his leg that he shrieked he run about the room he cried murder over the tub he tum∣bled regardless where he was or what became of wi  e Winifred or all the world but himself  So true is what was said by the first philoso∣pher before the flood and has been annually ob∣served by all Philosophers Playwriters Anno∣tators and Essayists that  It is natural for our own sufferings to overbalance all other considerations  The same  SCENE  continued  David  and  Winifred  seated as at first  WINIFRED  Look you David be quiet I tell you you did not hurt me much what I have put to your leg will cure it so drink up your porter and I will fetch another quart  Exit  Mr Llwhyddwhuydd when she was gone began to be in doubt whether he should or should not pull off the piece of blacksticking plaister that the dame had applied to his leg for the bite He wasn't sure it was the  Court∣stickingplaister  because as he was a chairman who had been brought up at St James's he would not have any thing as he told her touch him made at any of the vulgars houses in her neighbourhood because as he was a gentle∣man born and got his living among quality therefore he would sooner he said have his leg  swell to the bone than any lowlifed medicine should come near his flesh  Imitating herein that nobleness of spirits which all those most respectablebut I am interrupted  Enter second quart of porter and Mrs  Shingle  WINIFRED SWINGLE  Now David I will have you be easy hear reason and not fly into any more passions nor don't swear against your wife for to be sure a finer woman  DAVID  Never was a finer woman to be sureSo is my loss the more I shall love her to my dy∣ing day but she has robbed me and run away herself into the bargain and where is her ho∣nour now  WINIFRED  Don't you talk so much about honour now I desire and require of you for if you would be a good christian you must forget and for∣give for what pray doth the Scripture say about honournot much and pray what do the people of honour say about the Scripture why not much So you need not so much mind honour if you will but be a good christian  DAVID  But then the Devil shall be a good christian for me God forgive usbut how can I ap  Shingle how can I bear to lye by her side now pray will there be any christanity in that  WINIFRED  Silence I tell you David You shall hear what I will read to you it is our teacher's ser∣mon which he did say at the Tabernacle last Sunday about forgiveness and christianity and women and our backslidings so pray David mind  Reads  Putting on her spectacles  The  JUSTIFYING EJACULATION  I say unto you my beloved that when the spirit agitateth the flesh it is a spiritual act but when the flesh motioneth the spirit it is a car∣nal one And this is the difference between GRACE and DISGRACE  For worldly things unless sanctification seeths them are no more than kitchen stuff which the scum of our sins maketh in boiling over and that is put into the offal pot of repentance  Therefore the saints of the Tabernacle be∣ing clarified by the justification of the new birth are pure Christian suet which when mixed with the plumbs of the righteous make up the pudding of glorification  Winifred  Speaks  O sweet Abraham what heavenly language is this don't go to sleep David I desire of  you how can you be worse than a heathen and not listen to this sweet soulsaving speech  Reads again  The pudding of glorificationtherefore I say that we may mingle the spirit with the flesh even as potatoes and buttermilk make stirra∣bout for that is the type of the carnalities and spiritualities  So I say  wiping her spectacles  it is not sin∣ful to consider the uprightness of the flesh as directed by the spirit because we may receive the spirit at home or in the fields or in an alley or in a centrybox and I'll stand centry among you and if you have faith you shall raise the dead to life I won't be a velvetmouth'd preacher like your church doctors and book learned blockheads nononoohohcan a boy fly a kite without thinking of the clouds can a wo∣man spread her fan without thinking of an angel's wings Therefore I say that the na∣tural man is not the spiritual man Yet the spi∣ritual man may think of natural things So those things are to be put forward which are to satisfy the longings of the soul and tho' at first it may be painful to undergo them  At that instant the tankard from the hand of Mr David fell to the ground the good man overcome with the two quarts of porter the keeping all night awake reflecting upon his honour and the potency of the preacher's ar∣guments dropped fast asleep Which when Mrs Winifred observed she sighed and said he was a lost soul waked him and after some time spent between them in settling the terms  she went home with David to be his house∣keeper  SCENE PLYMOUTH  Madam Llwhyddwhuydd Corporal Knott Moun∣tebank Doctor Duel Merry Andrew Cheat∣ing at Cards and Newspapers  THE Corporal by this time and his lady began to view one another in not that rap∣turous point of sight as at first All the plate and ready money which she had taken with her was expended for Mr Knott had too much of the fine gentleman in him not to be fond of play and too good an opinion of him∣self to fancy any person could take him in but after the money was all gone his eyes were opened and he determined to commence gam∣bler himself  At his quarters lodged a Mountebank and his man The Merry Andrew was a master of arts in sporting he could bend slip shade spur featheredge work a brief knew shorts and longs the high and low games at put the three shuffles of whist upper and under palm opening a pack or rounding dice with all the secures the bars loads ringing of changes c c c  But he having then an occasion for a part∣ner because he wanted to take his master in for a sum and as all sporting men act best by confederacy the Corporal and Pickle Herring entered into a family compact  Mean while poor Mrs Llwhyddwhuydd daily sat disconsolate at home never seeing her gallant  but when he reel'd to bed incapable of be∣having to her like a gentleman  I wish some ladies of my acquaintance with whom it is at this moment a toss up between inclination and interest would read this part of my book carefully and they would know not∣withstanding modern memoirs mention whis∣pering Zephyrs eternal constancy lovelane assignations breathstopped kisses midnight moonshine a charming fellow and the post chaise door openthat according to the un∣doubted testimonials of several maiden gentlewomen who by heartfelt experience vow a lady is worse cooped up who goes off with her gallant than the most domestic wife that un∣dergoes the drudgery of the nursery and kitchen  Let us only example Mrs Llwhyddwhuydd She had no person to visit her was visited by no person obliged from having a house of her own to put up with a mean ready furnished lodging in which sitting all day solitaryfor believe me dear ladie the fine fellow of your fancy soon grows sick of his sweatmeats and every fond couple who leave honour family and ALL for love having then nothing but love to live upon soon eat up their allowance  Think ladies what Mr David's wife suffer∣ed who like all other eloping ladies had trusted the gallant with all and dreaded to ask him for a single shilling lest he should think her extravagant denying herself necessaries because he should not grumble at expence How melancholy her case no companions but her own thoughts reflecting and comparing past with present times her former respect her pre∣sent  infamyher husband's tenderness his repeated tenderness her gallant's coldness his continued indifference  It is not I hope so bad with every lovely lady errantress Yet many of them have experienc∣eddon't sigh dear creaturesI know its a melancholy scene and in the catastrophe still more vexatious because the reason which some ladies alledge for running away from their guardians or parents is the unbearable usage which they receive at home therefore apply to gallants in hopes of mending their condition as flying fish spring out of the sea to avoid the Dolphin and tumble into the jaws of the shark  Yet as the most timeservingscribbler sub∣scribes himself at the bottom of a dedication to his right honourable patron as the tradesman bows bill in hand to his honour with paral∣lel awe I address the ladies and assure them that my opinion of their magnanimity will not suffer me to imagine any thing here said can alter what a fine woman has already resolved uponNospite of all advice or example her spirits will carry her through whatever her will gives the word for let the consequence beno matter what  David's spouse had for some time been in a most uncomfortable state She felt the severe pinches of necessity which are evident symptoms of repentance daily hourly did she reproach herself how ill she had used her dear dear hus∣band how ill her gallant had used her not a friend had she to confide in except the Merry Andrew abovementioned to him she now and then disclosed her griefs he proffered her all the assistance in his power vowed he had a vast  regard for her and sealed those vows upon her lips just at the instant the Corporal opened the door  All in rage Mr Knott rushed on the tum∣bler kicked him down stairs bd his lady and vowed never again to bed her  Indeed Mr Knott was glad of an occasion to break off the acquaintance for he found it very heavy supporting her out of his pay and beside he had commenced another intrigue with a lady who kept a raffle who had agreed to go off with him  The tumbler all in a rage for being used so by the Corporal went instantly to his mas∣ter and discovered that the night before him∣self and the Corporal had cheated the doctor at cards of fifteen pounds four shillings and told his master that his conscience would not let him keep it  No one thing can hurt a lady or gentleman or any other two legged existent if there are any other persons in this kingdom that are not either gentlemen or ladies except some of the Opera SingersI say and am sure nothing can hurt so much as being made a fool or a tool unless selfinterest orders it so to bethen indeed as ABCDEandc observed it is proper to appear in taste  But to be a tool and be out of pocket by itSeneca at the head of his stoical regiment of Old Buffs could not bear it  And as the doctor like all other doctors wore a sword which I believe the faculty at first bore emblematically to denote an aptitude to kill after a consultation with his Merry Andrew  he determined upon having his money and sent Mr Knott the following letter  SIR  I Ham by my purfeshon as will as you a gen∣tleman because as your a soger so am I a doctur of fysick I did not think ani gentleman wode ave taken away mi moni clandestenly that is rank burgularly and wors then robbing upon the hi way  However Sir I suppose your a gentleman for all that so I desir you'l gi me satissfakshon and send me my moni agin or mete me with your sword at nine o'clock to nite in the ditch by the cloisters it will be moonlight and we can see to kill one another  Yours Doctor JONES  The Corporal received this note as he sat over a large bowl of punch with two recruits just listed He was as brave as British spirits could make him and reading the letter swore 'twas very well he'd come he would do every thing like a gentleman and give every body satisfac∣tionbut as to returning or paying the money back he was above itNo he was too much a man of honour he swore to be compelled no the sword should decide it  All flush all gallant was Mr Knott the drum beating recruits singing and bumpers going briskly aboutYet the contents of the letter began like oil to prevent the potency of  the brandy punch any longer sublimating into the Corporal's head  Not that he feared the doctor or even death the president and commander in chief of all doctors but his honour was doubly concerned he promised to meet a lady a new lady that night and he would not break that appoint∣ment for twenty doctors but then who would dare to say Knott wou'd'nt fight No body should he swore and in order to keep his word and honour with both parties he laid his plan of operations accordingly  The doctor who was equally political  in what a political age do we now live  made this appointment by moonlight because his anta∣gonist should not discover that he had a quire of white paper for a breastplate fastened neatly under his shirt  Each combatant firmed in his safeguard scheme went with the utmost intrepidity to the combat Nobly magnanimously they met So whennocome all ye spirits who have inspired the belligerant powers to firm fight∣ing and thou whoever thou art whether begot by Folly or Madness or both thou AETHERNAL who presides over duels suitablespirit for such a subject inspire me to describe the memorable behaviour of those truly paired bellonists who so intrepidly paraded upon the supposedtobesanguinaryspot and then so woundlesssososo  So have I seen  ay reader and so may you also have seen as well as me a great many things but among all the shews did you ever observe a slit deal figure set up on the top of a malthouse tunnel or as a scarescrow in a garden holding in each hand  a wooden sword which by the contrivance of the carpenter and force of the wind whirl'd its arms about above and below across a∣round slashing striking flourishing in every prizefighting direction ingratefully thrashing that air which puts it in motion  Thus is a duellist agitated by honour which is no more than air a puff a wind a vapourMistake not the editor's meaninghe is only writing concerning the term honour which urges planet struck people to take the unnecessary trouble of cutting one another's throats when as the madman observed  let but your enemies alone and they'll dye of themselves  But duellists like Jobson at blindman's buff lay about them slap dash north east west south on every point of the compass because this honour answers to all points all make a point of honour  It was one of honour's points the moneygetting point which goaded the doctor to this honourable experiment and which the Editor would not have been so explicit in had he not taken the trouble of visiting tennis courts billiardrooms horserace meetings whistclubs skettlegrounds hazardtables and nine hole alleys and been assured from all parties there that the doctor was right in point of honour to demand his money and the Corporal was right in point of honour to refuse returning it  The place appointed for their meeting was a very wide dry trench high mounded on each side and open at each end like that part of New Market turf called the devil's ditch and where for the name sake all hereafter duels should be decided  They came to the spot just as the clock struck nine they drew their swords and stood in quart and tierce attitudes between four and five yards asunder  They flourished their blades on which the moon shine bright beaming the glare startled the heroes  As veracity is the Editor's principle observance throughout this treatise it is necessary to re∣late how two such men could be brought to the scene of action and draw their swords at each other  The doctor was assured by his tumbler that if he did but send a challenge it would bring the Corporal to any terms and he had nothing to do but only go to the appointment draw his sword and Knott would return the money  After by his man's advice the letter was sent the mountebank began to have some qualmshe doubted he was dismayed and as Mr John Wesley and Mr John Wes∣ley's coadjutors have often declared  that Satan buffetted them about  even so was the doctor's tho  ghts tossed here and there and not know∣ing what to make of himself he resolved to bumper it about until fighting time to drive off even the idea of death  Not that he way any stranger to that spectre having employed him in as many shapes as the doctor had patients but he wanted not that fiend to have any concerns with himself therefore he drank to fortify his mind and wore a stationary breastplate to barricade his noble parts  The Corporal marched to the rendesvouz with a certainty of successFirst from his  own consequence that the quack scoundrel dare not fight him next let it even come to the worst and he should be obliged to draw his swordMr Knott had planned such a schemeand entirely by the scale sector and true modern practise of duelling which is to ac∣quire the vast vast honour of being a fighting man and duellist without running any dange∣rous risque  The Corporal's plot was to wait for his an∣tagonist to make the first thurst then to fall backwards immediately and bid the doctor make the best of his way off because that he himself was a dead man the doctor having done for him  Both thus secure in their safeguards stood firmbut at the distance beforementioned indeed it is proper all quarrelling people should so keep asunder their right arms were extend∣ed sword pointparalled to sword point  At last the doctor being by drink the most elevated quavered out ha ha and stamped his foot at the same time but the unfaithful sod sinking to his tread brought his body forwards destroyed the centre of gravity and prone on his face he fell without stretched arm and wea∣pon  The Corporal observed the glittering steel ad∣vance backwards at that signal fell down and with a great groan cried outO I am done forit's through and through meDoctor I forgive youbut make the best of your way offforohI am a dead man  Terrified at these words his antagonist reflect∣ing on what it was to kill a man and not ac∣cording to the secundum artem statute crawled  backwards on his hands and knees crab like out of the opposite end of the ditch Leaving his sword as he supposed sticking in the Cor∣poral's body as soon as he got upon his feet he scamper'd off strait forwards not minding which road he took all he thought of at that time was the hue and cry which he fancied he heard very plainly behind him  The Corporal rising by degrees was soon satisfied of the success of his scheme and pick∣ing up the duplicate sword hastened to his other rendesvouz and there he shewed his new lady the weapon which he had brought away with him telling Madam Raffle  I was obliged to kick that scoundrel mountebank my dear and make him deliver up his sword here it is you see for his insolence to pretend to dare to hint any thing against your reputation  In the beginning of every intrigue fond beauty fancies all is gospel which her gallant speaksKnott's new mistress replied  That to be sure I knowed as how Mr Corporal you was a vastly brave man and we will live and dy and I'll go through the world with you  But the catastrophe of their loves hereafter  We have now got rid of a pair of lovers as dextrously as any play wright who after cun∣ningly bringing them together gives the promp∣ter a cuewheuwheu whistles Mr Pimper∣limpimp the word giver and the brace of woers are intersected from the audience by the canvas landscape or size painted street scene and the rest of the comedy goes on as usual  When our last express came away the moun∣tebank was on foot terribly racing it along  panting and tremblingthe conclusion of his helter skelter flight we shall now relate under the Anticomic title of  The ORIGINALITY of GHOSTS AND ANATOMY of PHANTOMS  RONDOCOSTO KAMBE DANESSO in his de∣fence of praeternaturals subnaturals and

continuance of the quack's history who we left upon foot nor have we yet brought him to a standstill Fright made him miss his way it was midnight before he reached the gates of his inn they were barred and every candle out in the neigh∣bourhood  Pleased to think all was so quiet he resolved to creep up the back way into the yard get his money and cloaths out of his room before day∣light and secrete himself among the miners  Up a broken butterice belonging to the gar∣den he scrambled and got astride the wall just as Tom the tapster opened the gardendoor in his breeches shirt and slippers  The moon brightly shining at the mounte∣bank's back made a long black shadow upon the grassplat which moving before the ser∣vant's eyes stopped him from stepping forward his knees knocked together his teeth chattered his feet he drew softly out of the slippers and and sidling barefooted he slunk into a dark ar∣bour at his left hand  The medicinemonger was not a whit less terrified at seeing a human figure in white for the moon gave him full view of the tapster A cross the wall he sat aghast he thrice attempt∣ed to say some prayers but had none to say He muttered the only religious sentiment which he knew viz grace after meat saying Lord make me thankful for what I have receivedthis over and over he repeated holding himself on the  wall by the help of his hands as a sailor fixes his fists upon the saddle pommel  The doctor was confident he saw the Corpo∣ral's ghost almost petrified with apprehension he sat there and there would have sat until morning had not the stronger fear least the ghost should be creeping along the side of the wall to seize him forced him from his place and heaving himself up by his hands he strad∣dling throwed himself along the wall on the ridge of the bricks with his eyes all the time fixed on that spot from whence the ghost had vanished  He reached the top of an old cowhouse and rolling himself upon it his weight broke the boards and betwixt two rafters he sell jammed midway his weight forced him down his bulk prevented his whole body to fall through there he was wedged fast by the waistband and fancy∣ing all hell held him he shrieked roared kicked flung his arms about and tumbled the loosened rotten planks over and over  The poor drawer hearing the dreadful out∣cries ecchoed his shrieks with shrieks more shrill and run up the yard calling out help murder fire help help  The noise wakened every one in the inn ex∣cept the landlord Each started up terrified at the exclamation confusion and affright seized them from first second floors and garrets from down feather and flocks all came hurry scurry like mob from the twelvepenny galleryBack to her own bed Betty the chamber∣maid slipped to put some things on leaving her gallant a London rider shaking in a fearraised argue fit  The hostess scudded from the serjeant of gre∣nadiers her eldest daughter slipped out of the commanding officer's apartment her youngest down barefooted was brought trembling upon the bootcatcher's back All the rest of the good company half dressed assembled round the tapster who told them there was a spirit playing the devil in the old cowhouse  By the tempting promise of two guineas the three ostlers and a stagecoachman were per∣suaded to go armed with pitchforks to find out this ghost and the company the female part all went together to get the rest of their cloaths on and the gentlemen the same agreeing to meet in the large dining room to hear farther particulars And Sir Greenfin Calipash was to be seated in the grand chair to take the examination  While the guests were getting ready all big with expectation like the polite audiences in Cocklane a new noise alarmed them an out∣cry which was within the house proceeding from the landlord who having been put to bed very drunk was by the continuation of the va∣rious noises waked and parched with thirst bawled out loud as asses bray  some oatale a tankard of oatale and beto ye  After the tapster and mountebank were brought up stairs all the company in the house the host excepted crowded into the roomall stood to∣gether promiscuous postilions baronets ostlers ladies bootcatchers squires chambermaids great heiresses cookmaids c c For fear and selfpreservation absorb all distinction in such terrible times of danger excepting that just then a lady even of the most delicate prin∣ciples  would prefer a porter to a pretty fellow for her partner  Sir  CALIPASH  in the Chair  The drawer deposed he saw the ghost and described it to be a black one  The poisoner of parishes gave in his evidence that it was a white one  Dr SINECURE the learned professor and con∣noisseur begged leave to be heard upon that sub∣ject concerning the seeming contradiction of deposition in respect of the colour of the ghost  And then he coughed and then he hemmed and then thus went on  I am conscious my most intelli∣gent auditors that I can clear this contradiction much to the satisfaction of the polite part of the assembly I have now the honour to speak be∣forebecause  cough and hem again  I say be∣cause ladies and gentlemen I have not only con∣sidered the nature of ghosts philosophically but by every rule of prespective as far as is re∣lative to the vanishingHave I Sir Greenfin your permission to proceed  bowing low as he ad∣dressed the president the president as low down bowing in return  Upon which the professor of universal con∣noisseurship in arts and sciences looking about him with much consequence coughed hem∣med spit wiped his mouth smoothed his foretop spread his stock pulled his ruffles and began  Every ghost every ghost and every appari∣tion and every apparition as well as every ghost possesses in its own nature two sides or contra∣superficies which are denominated philoso∣phically  an opaque side and a lucid one  cough  now the two witnesses being as it were fixed or placed at opposite angles saw the op∣posite sides of the ghostfor instance the draw∣er who saw it a black ghost had his rays of light absorbed by refrangibility of reflection while the other had a view of the ghost in his illumi∣nated state arising from refraction because the radiancy of the rays striking upon the retina and this pellucidity of shade is called by the painters the CLEAR OBSCURE  cough c  Thus therefore I form my hypothesis  coughs  Suppose my left thumb to be A my left little finger B all my left hand C  Hem    hem  now therefore I say A  plus  B B  minus  C because every person being capable of seeing a dark or a light that is an opaque or a lucid su∣perficies or side belonging to my finger and thumb not only according as I form it into an inclined plain then the shades and lights fly off in tangents of obtuse angles or if that the ob∣ject refracted is diametrically opposite in a hori∣zontal parallel to the optic nerve thus it was one saw the apparition in a black or nigriferous point of sight and the other beheld it as a light or illuminated appearance  Cough hem and spit  Had I my most ineffable auditors had I my books and instruments here I might perhaps have demonstrated this more clearly  Sir Tim Dowgate replied it was clear in∣deed and he apprehended every syllable on'tvastly clear indeed lady Dowgate answered the doctor's a most amazing man of science and I am positive has more true learning than all Doctors CommonsIndeed lady Hadit observ∣ed nothing could have been delivered more  clearly and she understood every word on't So do I so do I its immensely clear vastly so replied all the polite heap and agreed that as a scholar an artist an orator and connois∣seur Dr Sinecure was quite the thing and they were sure on't  The underbred part of the assembly allowed him to be a most wonderful man and every one gentle and simple joined in praising loud∣ly his late lecture and great learning and they agreed he had made it out so well that they all understood it  The doctor condescended to incline his head in a direction between a bow and a nod with the utmost pedagogick consequence  Then Sir Green fin Calipash stood up and tucking his neckcloth ends under his garnet breast buckle he begged leave to observe that as he had al∣ways made the good of this nation his study and would venture to say that he knew both Old and New England's political constitution as well as any one man in it Yet he could not say although he apprehended every thing doctor Sinecure had said yet he could not say he un∣derstood the meaning of these affairs about black and white ghosts because though he believed in ghosts as much as any christian could yet why sholud ghosts be black or white either why might they not as well be of any other colours  Dr  SINECURE  Black and white are no colours Black is an absorbment white an aggregate  hem  ghosts cannot be of any colourergo  hem hem hem  Sir  GREENFIN  So then I suppose you would persuade me by that  inuendo  of ghosts not being of any colour that they can't be of any party but I know better I know that ghosts are as liable to be in the French interest as they are to be of ours and that this may be a political stroke either of our foreign or domestick enemiesmay not the thieftakers and ghosts have a fellowfeeling  Lady  HADIT  Screaming out a laugh  A fellow seeeelingoh Sir Cali∣pash what an ideacan ghosts feel  Enter  Landlord  in shirt and napkin nightcap  Lady Hadit was the first who viewed him and her ladyship gave a loud shriek sprung up∣on on the windowseat and wrapped herself in the windowcurtains  Every one in the room by this time had a glance of the figure in white all run helter skelter oversetting benches tables chairs stools burrowing like rabbits underneath them and hitting their heads against one another striving to hide themselves  Between Sir Greenfin's legs crept the land∣lady which overset the knight upon Sir Timo∣thy Dowgate who was hiding himself under his wife's petticoats lady Dowgate's head and shoulder buried at the same time beneath a card table  Every person rowling topsy turvy one upon another the furniture crackingDr Sinecure the chimney board being thrown down had made there to cover and Tom tapster and cook maid Nan took to the same hidingplace  The reader may recollect that at the alarm of the ghosts the innkeeper waking parched with thurst bawled out for some oat ale not any being brought he determined to fetch some himself and as it was the middle of summer and he very hot would not stay to put any cloaths on but out of bed hurried down and seeing a light in the large one pair of stairs room opened the door and occasioned the aforesaid confusion wond'ring he stood and called out I only want Tom tapsterOh Christ cries Nanny who stood with Tom in the chimney cornera great groan came from doctor Sinecure who was mounting by Tom's help he began to work with his elbows to pull himself into the chimney  Where is Tom tapster again the land lord called outO Lord again shrieks out Nanny and was running from him although her old sweetheart and twice asked in church the waiter seizing her by her gown skirts begged her for God's sake not to leave him the doctor was by this time standing upon the tapster's shoulders striving still to mount higher Let go my gown for God's sake Tom thus Nanny began pitiously to request her trembling lover if you have any love for me Tom get away least the Devil fly away with us both  LANDLORD  Where is tapster Tom  NANNY COOK  Here here Sir and please your honour Mr Devil he's in the chimney place squire but dear good gentleman my lord Devil I hope your honour won't take me along with him for all he holds me fast good Mr Devil don't for God's sake Go Tom go go now don't you hear how his worship calls you  The landlord began to be terrifiedthe word Devil being so often mentioned had an effect upon his spirits and he turned his head about to see where he could run to  When lady Hadit who had been at bopeep behind her windowcurtain imagined she could be certain the figure in white must be flesh and bloodmore earnestly looking she vowed she could take her oath to its being a man cou∣rageously left her pedestal and advancing de∣manded who are you  LANDLORD  Me Madam please your ladyship the land∣lord my name's Jordan  LANDLADY  from under Sir  Greenfin  It's the Devil in my husband's shape my lady oh don't go near him  LANDLORD  The Devil I believe has been in your shape several years I am surebut I am the landlord roy lady  Lady  HADIT  Sir I take for granted that you are flesh and blood and not a spirit but if you are Satan or Beelzebub or any other of those sub∣terranean geniusses which the vulgar world call the Devil I presume you are too polite to behave indelicately to persons of quality  LANDLORD  Indeed my lady I'm no more a devil than any other christian body whatever and I only want a little oatale and that made me call Tom tapster  Coming Sir bawls the waiter and down souse on his posteriors squashes Dr Sinecure upon the hearth and his teeth were loosened by the fall for he stood upon Tom's shoulders who bolted out in an instant but over eager as he stooped to get out of the chimney he beat his master down with his head  The sidelong attitude in which the landlord lay across one of the benches made lady Hadit burst into a violent laugh for it was as her ladyship said  such  a sightthis mirth and the preceding conversation dispelled the good com∣pany's fears they raised themselves by degrees or else were helped up Tom and landlord went down and the rest retired to their separate apartments  The landlady waited upon lady Hadit and would have made an apology for her husband's rudeness in standing naked before her  LADY  HADIT  Not at all Mrs Jordan I beg you'll not men∣tion it pon my honour it was excessively drole I dote upon such things  Mrs  JORDAN  Your ladyship's vastly good to be sure  Lady  HADIT  But my dear creature Jordan had you seer him fall downmy GodI though I should have expiredsuch a sight  Mrs  JORDAN  A wretched sight to be sure your ladyshipbut then I am obliged to put up with it How∣ever I am vastly glad that as how after my brute of a creature had been so mischiefous as one may sayI am happy that he could divert your ladyship So I wish your Ladyship good night  Exit  Lady  HADIT  Good night Mrs Jordandivert me my God what wretches there are in this world  Sleeps  Interlude between the  ACTS CALLED The MISTERY REVEALED  This is to satisfy all the Curiosi in  England Scotland  and  Ireland  concerning the  Spiriting away of Miss Canning  And also of the  CockLane Miss Fanny's Spirit  THESE were phenomena of such vast consequence to the public that all the people in London interested themselves strongly either on one side or the other The cause of these transactions must have remained a secret had it not been for this publication which is authenticated beyond doubt or even beyond con∣tradiction for my brother has made his affidavit about it and gave me his papers and from those papers for the satisfaction of the town and country and in my brother's own words too I shall insert it as he swore to its veracity before the worshipful the whole bench of justices  The  Journal of M TRIP  I William Trip mate of the Concord trans∣port captain Robert Farding of Lynn Regis master do declare that as we were coming from Lisbon June it happened to be my watch upon deck I saw a bean cod overset in  our ship's wake just as we were coming out of the Tagus  We having not taking in our boat I got down abaft cast off the painter and skulled away to pick up a person I saw floating and brought him on board our vessel  The gentleman whom I got out of the water happened to be a Roman Catholic parson one whom they call in their lingo a Jesuit and who had got out of Portugal by stealth  He was very ill while he was on board us and I tended him So one day as we lay off the Wight he sent to speak with me and when I came he desired me to sit down by him and hear someting he had to say to me  Upon which that I might be as one may say yard arm and yard arm with him I got a coil of rope clapt it aloft my sea chest brought it along side his hammock so I set down on it and our heads were then on the same latitude toge∣ther  So then he began reaching out his hand on the starboard side says he my good friendyou have been so civil to me that I have no way to return your kindness but by making you a pre∣sent of this book of receipts and telling you a piece of secret history that you may make money of it if you have a mind to print it  You must know Mr Trip that our society for many years found our interest declining both in France and Portugal and therefore our superiors thought of reestablishing themselves in England  Several missionaries that were sent from Rome to England assured us in their letters that the English people would believe any thing that  the system or fashion of the minds of the gene∣rality of both the high and low life multitude turned upon an axis whose points were CON∣CEIT and CREDULITY  The success which the methodists and their doctrines met with encouraged us greatly nay our society received several letters from their most eminent preachers in your island and they told us our mission would be received provid∣ed we joined them and that upon particular pecuniary concessions on our side they would unite with us Because they assured us they must and would be of infinite service to our so∣ciety since they knew so well how to work upon the multitude  Before we would consent to sign any articles with them we resolved from experiment to discover how far we could venture to impose upon the people of England  I was dispatched upon that mission and to prevent suspicion or the least inquiry of what I was I made interest to be engaged as one of the subaltern players belonging to the Theatre in London only to do trifling parts and when I was once seen upon the Stage in that capaci∣ty it was impossible any person could suspect I was good for any thing  A brother of our order followed me with fresh instructions but as his part required he should be introduced at all hours and in all places to the very best company he assumed the cha∣racter of an Italian fiddler tooth cleaner and designer and when we have met to compare notes in an evening he has made me smile to hear him relate how every door used to fly open at his approach and he would gossip for two  hours with very great personages while the antichamber would be full of colonels and com∣modores waiting for an audience  The earthquake was of my projecting so was the bottleconjurer it was me who wrote the prophecy for the person called the lifeguard∣man but in reality he was porter to the Fancis∣cans at Padua  He as you may remember foretold the re∣turn of the earthquake would happen such a day and Bloomsburyfields and Bloomsbury∣square was filled with coaches and whole fa∣milies crammed in them who there set all night not daring to trust themselves in their own houses I smiled when I saw them thus huddled together but was amazed to see many of your preachers hurrying out of town as if they were panick struck with the dread of leaving  this  worldwhen they are certain there is one so infinitely preferable and in which by the doctrines they profess they must be eternally happy  Are they thought I only like physicians who administer medicines for the good of mankind  as they say  yet have no faith in their own pre∣scriptions  One afternoon by chance I met with Eliza∣beth Canning she had lost sixpence was cry∣ing about dared not to go home she saidI ob∣served her she had the most stupid look yet on conversing with her I discovered she possessed cunning and obstinacy  By the promise of making up her loss a new topknot and the temptation of riding in a hack∣neycoach I prevailed upon her to go with me and when she was perfect in her part I ex∣hibited  her as you must remember this scheme answered to prove English peoples aptness to embrace or take part with incoherencies  Rejoiced I was when the gentleman who endeavoured to detect the imposture met with such opposition by his example I was sure other magistrates would be deterred from making any other strict and impartial enquiresfor in∣deed Mr Trip thus the Jesuit went on though your nation is one of the best in the world yet at present folly and prejudice have spread them∣selves so pestilentially among all ranks and de∣nominations that any person who now would en deavour to benefit his country from a praise∣worthy principle of integritySo great is the defection throughout all degreesso epide∣mic the contagion of selfinterest the patriot would be hooted at for a madman reviled as a pretender or punished with contempt and if possible with beggary  Preferment makes the English nation be∣have just as the children of Israel did when the manna fell among them they snatch up all they can overload themselves often no matter by this method less is left for their neighbours  After this affair was over I was sent for back to Rome upon special affairs relative to our society but I left a brother of our order full instructions how to proceed and the plan for a project that as soon as he recovered he was to put in execution it was the COCKLANE PHANTOM or what was then called  Miss Fan∣ney  's  Spirit  This was our most favourite scheme this was our corner stone we therefore employed  moreI suppose he would have said  skill  but our ship at that moment by the wind shifting took such a lust that her leerufftree dipped in the water and the Jesuit was canted overboard out of his hammock pitched his head upon the trunnion of a four pounder and never spoke another word  I was overset but I soon righted but as for my companion death clapped a stopper upon his tongue as quick as one could crack a biscuit  And this is the truth and the whole truth and nothing but the truth as witness my hand  WILLIAM TRIP  Mariner  In the analytical destination of the incorpora∣lities of ghosts wrote originally in Runic trans∣lated by SAXO GRAMMATICUS into the Ger∣man there is one page which for the benefit of all true believers I have taken the trouble to render into English viz  There are three distinct or separate species or classes of ghosts and apparitions  The first is the miser's spectre this phan∣tom invariably appeareth loaded with chains to tell where money hath long been hid and it cometh as a skeleton because it is supposed to starve itself to death  ergo  it cannot have any flesh upon its bones  The second is the windingsheet ghost or torchholdingimmateriality which is a lovesick maiden that glideth along the mid∣night dew to undraw the feet curtains of her forsworn swain and bidding him be∣think  him of former affairs of plighted troth and ruin'd maidenheads She cometh in a white sheet to do pennance for being so foolish as to break her heart hang drown or poison herself for love and constancy  The third and last is the hobgobblin or raw head and bloody bonesthis is very ter∣rifying and often used to appear to several particular persons both at sea and land an hour or two before an engagementbut it is at present as well as the lovesick ghost almost out of fashion  Eternal infamy upon his name who wishes to have any more ghosts among us and all ho∣nour praise and preferment attend and wait upon the ambassador's chaplain who gave the Grand Signior wise and christianlike advice not to open a communication between the Mediterranean and Redsea because it would disturb all the ghosts that are now so quietly laid in the last mention'd ocean  SCENE PLYMOUTH  A BEDCHAMBER  Mrs  LLWHYDDWHUYDD  sola in bed tossing sighing fretting turning tum∣bling wishing and despairing till on a sudden she upstarted looking seriously at the light upon the hearth and taking a pinch of right rappee thus soliloquised  THE candles just burnt out and no Knott come yet what would I give if I was but at home with my dear husband if ever I put my trust in man again except my own dear husband I wish this pinch my poison oh what villains are that inconstant sex except my own poor dear husband O that he did but know where I was that my dear David was but with me he would not let me lie alone frightening myself if I was but this moment with my dear husband in my own room or if he was but with me hereas to Knotthe's a scruba wretch I despise and contaminatehe never knew how to value a woman of meritno not he let him have his trulls I always was too good for him I despise him nobody do I love or ever did but my dear husband just then her stomach began to pain her her heart grew cold she put forth her hand upon the chair by the bedside was a bottle three parts full of medicinal water  She raised the elixir to her mouthand gently gulpingoncetwicethriceadmini∣stered warmth to her sorrow chill'd breast dis∣content died away sleepful she sunk upon her pillow lulled to rest by the calm opiate of ge∣nuine Hollands  SCENE next MORNING  JUST as Madam Llwhyddwhuydd sat down to her tea the Merry Andrew came jumping into her apartment bawling out as loud as a bribed voter bellows liberty Madam Knott Madam Knott here's good news about you in the newspaper your husband has sent for you home again  Cups saucers teapot toast and butter all tumbled to the floor the lady in her hurry of joy rushing strait forward overset the break∣fasting stool Where where is it she cried snatching at the same time the Chronicle out of the tumbler's handsbut recollecting her in∣ability to make the words out returned the paper and begged the young man would read every word of it to her loud and very loud  Mr  SOMERSET  began  Whereas Chloe the wife of musterhere is a hard word madam full of double L's and double D's and double U's and I can't spell it  Mrs  LLWHYDDWHUYDD  I know it child never mind that my dear go to the next word  Mr  SOMERSET  I'll begin again madam and skip that  Mrs  LLWHYDDWHUYDD  Do so my best friend  Mr  SOMERSET  reads again  Whereas Chloe the wife of Muster what do you call um was decoy'd away by one Knott a Corporal this is to give notice that if she will return home to her own lawful spouse she shall meet with a hearty welcome and no questions asked  The husband's grief was left to the reader's imagination The Editor bequeaths the wife's joy to the same colourist and as he made bold to carry her off takes the same freedom to bring her home again her husband received her with all that joy which every fond forgiv∣ing spouse has felt when with outstretched arms he once more impounds his long stray∣ed lady  Blessing each other they embraced and over and over again they blessed that day and also blessed the inventors of publishing newpa∣pers advertisements c  In honour of the  Press  I must be allowed  A DISSERTATION on DAILYPAPERS  No Patriot in or out of place ever consi∣dered their utility with that grateful attention these publications deserve  Is there a want in the world but what may be instantly relieved if the patient will but con∣sult the columns of those morning and evening intelligencies with as much gravity as ever any one of the faculty pulled off his gloves I do declare that without the help of these dic∣tionaries for the day the great business of the nation could not be carried on  How could Mrs Philips hope for the continu∣ance of her customers or the nobility and gen∣try know where to pay in their Opera subscrip∣tions where could they send for the best royal beautifying fluid or could be sure of having French chicken gloves genuine how should we know when Mr Whitfield preaches in Edin∣burgh or Georgia or where we should be sure of Roman purl unadulterated how should we be ascertained where the most notified Dr Tay∣lor performs his occulistical or oratorial ope∣rations or where the best liquid blacking is to be got where to send for the pure aetherial volatile quintessence of essence or how could we be informed that the seawater at BrightHelmstone is better than any other seawater were it not for being so instructed by paragraphs and advertisements aforesaid O credulity crecredulity thou universal power how much are we indebted to thy influences  New discoveries elixirs lotions injections and nostrums for the ladies are as we read to be had at every toyshop  Sometimes indeed the applications and uses of these extraordinary succedaneums are not expressed in so delicate a stile as polite per∣sons might wish But when we consider the  humane intent of the makersup and venders of these medicines the stile is excused  As in the country we put up with the inde∣licacy of the entertainment for the good will of the host  The humanity of the College of Physicians here must be noticed they have an authority to inspect into medicinemongers and can nay and should and I suppose do visit several places where drugs are sold Yet it never was known that any deputation from Gresham College or Apothecarieshall inspected into the noted Dr Franks Dr Sarrant Dr Rock Dr Jesuit Drop Dr Greek Water c c c c c c c c c This wilful omission is owing to the same public spirit by which Mr Ashley on Ludgatehill is agitated gentlemen of the faculty are willing to let every person have physic as well as punch in small quantities and therefore wink at the a∣foresaid advertisers  Yet such is the malignity of humankind that even this generous behaviour of the faculty has been found fault with and the babbling pack of scandal yelpers bark out that as quacks make diseases worse the profits of the regular bred must be thereby increased  Malicious insinuations as if gentlemen of the M D signatures would be guilty of such pitiful finesses Thus the mad multitude have as basely clamoured against the POLICEThe lowlife herd of hirelings give out that truly if the worthies in commission would but take half as much pains to suppress the bawdyhouses bagnios c in their parishes as they labour to take highwaymen it would be of more benefit  to the nation in generalbut how little do these people know of sportingif the cover was grub∣bed up the breeding of game would be prevented how then could money for a subscription pack of harriers tarriers c be collected  With what force I weenbut good heaven forgive us God bless their majesties and every person who is commissioned by them to see justice done as it should beAnd as Mr Jacob Henriques observes it is all for the glorificati∣on of Old England  When I mention the word quacks it is not to be presumed that any gentleman recipeven∣der acting under letters patents can be hinted at because we are all certain patents are only granted to men of excellent science of approv∣ed education whose discoveries have been owing to indefatigable study and are witness from re∣peated experiments before the most skillful to be entirely calculated for the health and preser∣vation of the people of England  These and many more uses than these be∣long to newspapers they not only bring health to patients but ladies to despairing lovers and wives to husbands as in the case of Mr and Mrs Llwhyddwhuydd now under our conside∣ration had it not been for the conveniency of advertising when could they have come toge∣ther again  Yet David did not descend one grain from the dignity of inbred honour by permiting his wife to return home  For while he had one readymoney customer left his big heart despised submission but when all his trade was lost the garrison of his great  mind was forced to capitulate his nobleness of spirit and blood of Japhet were forced to sur∣render prisoners of war at and to discretion  He obeyed the times  Madam Llwhyddwhuydd gave him her hand he kissed ittears of joy swelled over his eye brinks and he told her in the name of God and good people how his heart was glad to see her to be sure and I do hope in deed I do now  Mrs  LLWHYDDWHUYDD  And so do I husband that nothing hereafter may be mentioned concerning my former with∣drawing myself for although my dear husband I esteem you as so worthy a man ought to be esteemed yet if ever you was to reproach me with what might or might not suppose to have happened during our separation that mo∣ment should be my last I would the next plunge myself to the bottom of the river and prevent that way your ill usage  Her spouse though in raptures at the stateli∣ness of his wife's gesture yet the resolution of her look frightened him fearful that she should make away with herself especially as he had been at such an expence to fetch her home too he kneel'd down and begged her to be pacified and forgive him if he had said any thing amiss  She forgave him and raised him with a tender reconciling look equal to what the most en∣raged though detected lady can soften into when her husband has made a proper humiliati∣on and giving up all his informers  For it is not possible a man can love his lady either married or unmarried unless he will  wink at her errors and the larger those errors are or the greater the number the more occa∣sion has he to manifest his affection  To do David justice which a man so well born as he was deserves although his enemies said he was a perfect t'otherendofthetownsman suffering himself to be carried down the tide in the corrupted currents of this world admitting the flaws and cracks of reputation to be cemented by the solder of selfinterest yet he never let a∣wry word pass his lips against his lady  Madam Llwhyddwhuydd grew again the ad∣miration of the neighbourhood and customers even the best in the parish assembled there every evening as before times  SCENE the TROLLOPEE'S CATASTROPHE OR RETORT UNCOURTEOUS  SOON after Mrs Llwhyddwhuydd's return Mr Ap Thomas her spouse's partner with a full pot of porter in his hand happened to run against her just as she came from her Sunday noon's walk in St James's Park  Her white satin trollopee was splashed with it and the very smell of porter always made Mrs Llwhyddwhuydd sick because persons are apt to depise what they get their living by her cloaths were spoiled and such cloaths tooa dress that the first dutchess in the land might have gone to court in  Passion ever has power to serve an ejectment upon reason the suffering lady on that account became so little mistress of herself that she call∣ed Thomas several severe names and at last told him he was a vulgar creature  The word vulgar was grimgribber to the ancient Briton to be reflected upon as if he was not a gentleman irritated him to that de∣gree that he returned her severe words with words yet more severe  The writer of this part has served his time to the knowledge of mankind and since worked se∣veral year journeyman in that profession else he never could have believed such words could have escaped any man's lips who valued himself upon being a gentleman as Mr Thomas utter∣edHe made use of such phrases that no per∣sons if they were not in a passion or chose to be looked upon superior to the scurrilous rank of informing constables would rehearse  For in most illiberal language he reproached her with the Corporal  Company coming in very fast she could not with decency stay to hear him any longer Ladies may like to listen to some sort of expres∣sions yet it is not proper every body should know it It was extreme modesty that made Mrs Llwhuddwhuydd quit the bar and leave her adversary master of the field of battle  She went up to her chamber and sent for Miss Shred to consult about repairing the da∣mage done to her dress then she acquainted Miss Shred with Thomas's abuse repeating the very words over and over and over again and concluded saying No Miss upon  my  honour I never can or ever will forgive that  Page  fellorHe told me that the Corporalmy Godbesides to call me whore Madam Whore my dear MissI never was on man's whore it was always love to which I gave up my soul not any mercenary views and there∣fore as I never took money how can I be a whore  Miss  SHRED  Indeed Madam I wish you was to have been last lecture night at our tabernacle to have heard that good creature the doctor divide the differ∣ence of going into keeping through inclina∣tion or interest  Love for love is as he said like the Levi∣tical law of an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth but mercenary matches with or without the parsin it is all the same is a sin not to be even purified even by regeneration But dear madam you never told me why you wou'd come home again I hope the Corporal was not inconstant  Mrs  LLWHUDDWHUYDD  Inconstant Miss Do you imagine the horrid country ladies could have any charms for a gentleman like Mr Knott who had been tit∣up a titup with all the beau moon of St James's Park  We suppose she means tête a tête  Inconstantno Miss I ashure you  looking in the glass  I didn't fear any rivals but I could never forgive the Corporal because he would not hold his tongue To be sure he mought have made himself worthy of any wo∣man's  love if he would not have boasted so and made my name the tenttalk of his com∣rades I vow Miss I have blush'd spontane∣ously as one may fay and my cheeks have burn'd as much as if one was talking of a bo∣dy When I us'd to reflect how my name mought be brought up as the Corporal's concu∣bine before a parcel of sutlers wives and sogers trulls  me  Miss was it ME to be treated soI could not bear the idea  rising up  I I to be used so  walking forwards and backwards her left hand extended upon her right breast her right hand waving a handkerchief in a curve or serpen∣tine line  I  here she set down again  I who was born in the Ingies and my mamma was first waiting woman of quality to the Empress of the Catawaws  Miss  SHRED  Pouring a little more into the glass  Indeed Madam it is immensely monstrous to reflect how men will blab and that is one rea∣son why I have often wished to be a person of quality because they don't care what is said about them  Miss  LLWHUDDWHUYDD  Very true dear Miss but as I am but a simple gentlewoman one is obliged to be careful con∣cerning one's reputation and as I left the Cor∣poral because I would not be talked off shall such a reptul as Thomas pretend to reproach me my husband knows of it and every body knows my husband is a man of honour and thereforeMiss your health  Miss  SHRED  To be sure madam such affairs as your's with the Corporal may happen to the finest woman in England and in polite life it is looked upon to be no more than an accident and no persons would blame you but vulgar creatures nor is there any harm in itthat is when it proceeds entirely from the spirit as we prove at our lovefeasts  The Methodists have all nightmeetings called Lovefeasts    Here followeth in the manuscript seven Chapters of Mr Zapanhiel  's  own handwriting upon the seven deadly sins and a collection of receipts of regenera∣tion Which he entitles  Fullers Earth for the Spots of the Soul  and the account how Miss Shred became a Methodist which is introduced by a preface of observation wherein he says that gam∣blers and ladies of pleasure if they live to grow old and have saved money enough to encourage our pastors or any pastors to pray by them they are weaned from their wickednesses and become sanctified for the older we grow the wiser we grow  And he says further in exhorting all sinners to regenerateOh what a heavenly comfort it is to consider that a sinner after running thro' a life of all wickedness shall only by attending on our tabernacle be purified Is it not a rich balsam for a sore soul therefore come unto us all ye who are afflicted with the remembran∣ces of the methods by which ye have got your wealth and ye shall but give a tythe to us by way of paying insurance to the saints who will  infallibly save you from being shipwrecked on the rocks of perdition and will stcer you into the harbour of grace Yet we are not Papists nowe won't give you absolutionwe are not Protestantsnowe will not save you by re∣pentanceno no we are Methodists and it is regeneration shall save you it shall be the cork waistcoat to keep you floating and ye shall not sink into the bottomless pit of the sea where the Devil of Hell lies in the shape of a shark to devour you  All these sentimental chapters the Editor post∣poned and therefore was obliged to cut out and to turn over above pages before he could find the continuation of this Register which went on as follows  The  Natural Reason  for a LADY's LONGING  David's lady soon had it in her power to per∣form her vowthe vow of revenge which she had solemnly taken to be even with Thomas her trollopee spoiler Finding herself with child to the great joy of her spouse she told her husband she longed for a bite or two at his partner Tho∣mas's nose and it was that which occasioned those learned quotations inserted in the first pages of this history And if the reader pleases to remember Mr David and his partner in the midst of that most classical conversation were called away by the noise of chair chairjust as Mr Llwhyddwhuydd had fixed his straps to the poles a message came that his lady was ta∣ken very ill upon which hurrying away as fast as he could with the fare he returned to comfort his good woman who that morning fell in la∣bour occasioned by her over care as an oecono∣mist  For though Madam Llwhyddwhuydd was big with child and reckoned every hour yet she would needs go to market herself because she said servants had so many ways of cheating their masters and mistresses It happened as she passed by a public house near the market two people were quarrelling about the critical rules of the game of Put the altercation being pretty high the cards were thrown out at the window just as this lady was passing by and the knave of Clubs hit her upon the nose She was frighted put into a chair carried home immediately and fell into labour in about half an hour Her friends immediately prognosticated that from the incident of the knave of Clubs striking her it would be a boy if it had been a queen they said it would have been a girl and that her son would as he grew up be an odd mortal and as comical to look at as the knave of Clubs was The subsequent behaviour of Needy has verifi∣ed the truth of the prediction  Just at this time many prodigies appeared in the political theatrical and scholastic worlds or circles  At this time the great alloway was in blossom at Hoxton and a maiden sizes at York city the first calf with five legs that ever was shown in England came to town that day and that day Mr Whitfieldbut whether these revo∣lutions and portents happened in consequence of Ned's coming into the world or that Ned's coming into the world was in consequence of these things happening we leave with submis∣sion to the retrospection of all searchers into fu∣turity  SCENE  the  DELIVERY  After Madam Llwhyddwhuydd was put into bed and her gossips assembled the good women ordered a manmidwife to be sent for but Mrs Llwhyddwhuydd knowing the objection her spouse had to menmidwives was prudent e∣nough to refuse such assistance because she was sure it would offend her husband's delicacy  However the other ladies were unanimous for a man She entreated she begged they were obstinate the dispute was loud it reached into the street and every stall chandlersshop and cellarkeeper in the parish assembled at the door and determined that as they knew David was sent for he should not pass into his own house until they had his word and honour to send for a manmidwife for his lady for as each said if it was only for the look of the thing he should have one David appeared at that instant they surrounded him as the print relates to you much better than I can However one figure in it I must beg leave to explain which is the bigbellied female who seems to be full of griefthat lady is spouse to a most celebrated wri∣ter of political papers and who has wrote very severely against menmidwives because not be∣ing able to pay for their attendance those gen∣tlemen had refused their assistance  She was a party deeply concerned in this dis∣pute and it afflicted her to take notice of Da∣vids obstinacyhe indeed once or twice at∣tempted to speakbut it was a vain attempt as he could not we beg leave to speak for him  p  SLAUGHTER  Surgeon  Man Midwife  Mr Llwhyddwhuydd was too fond a husband to deny his wife what she desired but being a great reader the newspapers and magazines informed him of the indecency indelicacy and evil tendency of having menmidwives  The putters together of those daily and month∣ly paragraph compendiums had proved that no husband of nice honour would suffer a manmidwife and as David was a man of the nicest honour how could he endure them  In some papers it was hinted that menmid∣wives could be of no use because the Indian women delivered themselves  In other papers it was inserted that in a state of nature there were neither men midwives nor parsons and that people could do well with∣out both and as how in the first ages and the first ages were the best ages and that this age was the worst age but in the first ages there were no arts or sciences nor occasion for any that people would live better with∣out them than with them that neither man∣kind or womankind had need for more help than the animals in the fields or the fowls of the air that it was only villainous custom evil habits wrong tendencies and the prejudice of education that made us employ surgeons tay∣lors chymists shoemakers menmidwives dancingmasters snuffmakers Frenchcooks saddles shirts shifts or pockethandkerchiefs  From the information of those weekly paid journalists we may easily account why GREAT SCHOLARS who study nature so nicely are such GREAT SLOVENS as they know by their extreme skill that we are not superior to the  beasts they chuse to retain as much brutality as possible in their behaviour  David like the traveller in the contention with the wind wrapped himself up in his sur∣tout determined to stand out the tempest when word was brought him that madam Llwhydd∣whuydd was brought to bed of a fine boy and as like the father  He would not stay to hear the rest of the messenger's observation bursting through the crowd run home and received the congratulati∣ons of his company Mr Llwhyddwhuydd in∣deed rejoiced having a son and heir and that was the utmost of his hopes wishes and pray∣ers before he had read the observations above∣mentioned Yet now his principal satisfaction arose from the reflection his lady was brought to bed without the help of a manmidwife  The  METAPHYSICAL SCENE  The authors of Joseph Andrews and Tristram Shandy wrote themselves into reputation and I believe got money by what they did and really deserved itEver since I have engaged in this work I have endeavoured to copy one or both of their stiles manners or maxims but I can∣not fancy myself quite so clever Yet have I all that customary fondness that becoming par∣tiality for my own works which every author ought to have and hold all the rest of my co∣temporaries in a trifling light to myself This I do as well as any or all the dramatic writers of England Ireland or Scotland but yet I don't find myself honestly speaking a jot better genius for all the abuse I make use of  If the connections I have with publishers could be on my side discharged or a protection granted me I might wear a laced coat and live without working as well as many other gen∣tlemen  Then I would no more meddle with a pen and ink than a lady in high keeping would mend her own linnen for my mind scorns the drudgery of writing reading and reflecting as much as any rich man in the kingdom can do  My wife has an acquaintance who promises to provide for me either in the church the navy the law the army the customs at court or in the excise it does not signify what branch it is for if a man has but interest he is fit for any place  Must it not irritate a genius like me or like my spouse to see so many dunces driving their one horsechaise or else crammed into hackney coaches taking the air to White Conduithouse on a Sunday raising a dust on the New Road and choaking such foot passengers as me and my wife but we enjoy the satisfaction to reflect though those wretches ride about flourishing in the folly of fineryyet they perhaps not one of them ever made a rebus or can repeat the Greek alphabet  At this instant the dear creature my spouse is sitting by me in dishabille indeed  for what need we outward ornaments when we can deck the mind with understanding or look upon the fashions of the world but to condemn or pity those that use them  Our base grovellingmoneygettingneighbours envy us and abuse us for suffering our children we have but six indeed to run about ragged  But I despise their rancour my wife its too well born too well bred and too great herself to descend to the servile domestic drudgery of tend∣ing nurseries or the base culinary employment of cooking victuals no we had rather go without a dinner than dress one for ourselves and the ingratitude and ignorance of the world won't allow us to afford a servant  N B This digression is here inserted to a∣muse the reader until Madam Llwhyddwhuydd was well enough to see company  All the better most people of Shuglane and Middlerow came to pay the lyingin visit But Madam Llwhyddwhuydd confessed to her very intimates that she cou'd not relish a visitor with half that satisfaction who lived on the city side of Northumberland house as she did those at the polite end of the town  The Gossips met and cawdle crown'd the board  Unworthy wou'd it be of me to have register∣ed this gossipping had not the meeting been so particularly famous for the metaphysical conver∣sation which they for the first time started in Englishconcerning several abstruse and occult points predicaments qualities essentials and immaterialities relative to ideas contract re∣sistance modes of the mind habits of the body rules of government errors of administration defects in religious worship inequalities of re∣wards and punishments hell happiness Doctors Commons faith perjury simony heresy adul∣tery accidents of matter and spiritual essen∣ces  Piecemeal have these subjects been retailed even unto this day in every coffeehouse ta∣vern punchhouse alehouse eatinghouse and nightcellar unless the more interesting vocations of politics strumpeting or gambling have employed the good company's attention  First GOSSIP  Indeed madam you say true and I must own that after I was delivered of my first child I could not help considering deeply about these things and so when I went down for my health into the country I used to love to see the hens lay eggs and then those eggs I was told would produce chickens upon which ladies a thought came into my head that I never have been satisfied about since and that is which was made first the yolk or the eggshell if the eggshell was made first how came the yolk in it if the yolk was made first how came the shell over that  Second GOSSIP  That madam is one of the mostest curious questions in the world and it was the parson of our parish who first axt me that question and he laughed at me cause I cou'dn't resolve him so I made my husband send it to the rial saciety and they'll tell us about it I know by and bye  Third GOSSIP  Now there is one thing that I want to know sadly because our sexton says the vestry di∣vided  about it and they should know to be sure ladies that is whether stillborn in∣fants have any sins to answer for  First GOSSIP  To my knowledge madam this has made great disputes among the clergy and they are divided in their opinions though to me it is as clear as noonday for how can poor infants answer when they never had been taught to speak  ALL  Oh to be sure quite right quite right indeed  Third GOSSIP  Pray ladies don't you take fate to be a free agent  Fourth GOSSIP  To be sure madam whatever may be a la∣dy's fate yet she is a free agent because now suppose I was fated to be married to a person whom I can't say I could relish it is at my up∣shot to be sure whether I will act or no and so fate is a free agent  But a gentleman who lodges in my one pair of stairs told me but yesterday talking about free agents and fate and what might be the fate of agents that fate and free agency were like king and commons that the mind was the monarch and the will was the people So I told him in answer that whatever his mind  was he could not have his will of me with∣out I had a mind  ALL  Oh no to be sure no to be sure  First GOSSIP  Now ladies give me leave to ask you whe∣ther as Adam never was born as other people have been sence that is no lady was ever brought to bed or with child of him could he have a navel  ALL  No no no to be sure no  Third GOSSIP  My brother ladies we all know is a great wri∣ter and once wrote a whole newspaper himself He is so great a genus at handling his pen that I was tould by the waiter at Ronelor how he mought have wrote a song and it would have been sung before the grand company there and that you know madam wou'd be the vastest honour imaginable because the quality cou'd recommend him you know to be poet larum songmaker to the rial familly but he has gone and disobliged my husband and all his friends for he has hired himself to a club of philoso∣phers and so be is to publish a book to prove how far freewill acts upon the loadstone and he says he don't doubt but he'll get a penshum for't  Mrs Murdock the nurse then began a dis∣course upon ethics to determine the identical spot of Satan's demesnes or where hellfire was She affirmed it to be seated in the middle of the sunbut Madam Celery the greengrocer's lady denied that and said it was in the middle of the earth  Miss Shred who was always a systemist sup∣posed there were several hells and that every comet contained one The Bible was quoted by Jenny Douglass but when it was asked what Bible because Mrs Murdock observed there were so many histories of the Bible pub∣lished at sixpence per month she cou'dn't tell what to say to it for she didn't suppose they could be all good because the bluepaper co∣vers said so  Madam Llwhyddwhuydd observed that she supposed they were all true translations and ex∣plications or else to be sure the bishops would not suffer such things to be published  Mrs  MURDOCK  Well there are so many religions and so many religious opinions and so many books about religion and so many disputes and so many sort of preachers that they are not all to be trusted  First GOSSIP  No Madam why an't they all christians  Mrs  MURDOCK  Christians no Madam why some are Presbyterians and some are Methodists  Miss  SHRED  As to Methodists Madam Murdock you must excuse me because they are the only christians for they are regenerated and no body can be a sincere christian until being regene∣rated but there are a great many people in the world that are of no religion  Mrs  MURDOCK  And that's better than not being of the true one for its a shame to see how parents use their children here the poor innocents are soused over head and ears or else they are circumscised or else made Quakers or else one thing done to them or else another and so they are bound prentice to this or to that teligion without ever know∣ing if they can like it And that makes so many different opinions in the world when they grow up to be men and women because it don't signify whether they were made Jews or Christians you see Jews behave as Christians and Christians as Jews and there's no telling one from to'ther I think  This conversation determined Madam Llwhyddwhuydd that as there were such dis∣putes about religion her son should not under∣go any spiritual ceremony until he came to years of discretion then he might chuse which religion he liked best and that was the reason our Master Neddy was never christened  SCENE ISLINGTON  Thus far the Editor compiled of the MSS and attended on the appointed Sunday at Mr WARNER'S who is a very good sort of a man and one to whom the putter together of these historical paragraphs has been very much obliged  This would not have been mentioned but to convince the world  all  authors are not so in∣grateful as to forget the friends who formerly filled their bellies  I have composed Drolls for Mr Warner's booth and by his recommendation I have wrote several dramas for the proprietors of pup∣petshows in which I used to adhere entirely to the strict rules of  Aristotle Rapin  and  Bossu  The chastity of taste among English audiences at that time was so pure they would not bear the smallest innovation of the unities of time and place even in Mr Punchbecause as the coffeehouse connoisseurs observed it is more instructive and more elegant even to be lulled into a slumber by the rules of art than kept awake and in spirits by all the fire of fancy contrary to the Greek and French scale or standard  At that time Mrs Charke sister to the late Mr Theophilus Cibber had a famous puppetshow which was conducted with such regulari∣tyTo compare the puppetshows of that time with the puppetshows of this time would be only an illnatured attempt But Charlotte Charke used to pride herself that her company her ladies at least were all vestals Because as she said a lady belonging to the Theatres  Royal may be weak enough or fond enough or mean enough and mercenary enough to descend being upon the town But who Mrs Charke used to exult who can say they ever supped with the Queen of Sheba at the Shake∣spear or had fair Rosamond at Haddock's  This daughter of Colley Cibber the late Poet Laureate was a lady of surprising singularity but the oddities of the human mind are unac∣countable  There is his honour Sir ****** a great po∣litician yet all his delight is chucking sixpence into a quart decanter  Is not Mr ***** the great physician an admirer of parched peas but cannot eat any except what he cooks himself  Mr ***** the famous mathematician pre∣fers battledore and shuttlecock to painting poetry and music and don't we all know seve∣ral dignified **** who though amazingly or∣thodox value themselves more upon their taste in venison and Madeira than in interpreting the scriptures  Some ladies of distinction have been known to admire low company their husbands at the same time not caring for any but it is impos∣sible to account why we are whim bitten So far has oddity been epidemical that noblemen have been known nay and several at this time are really fond of their wives and what is as remarkable their ladies are as warm in their affections for their husbands  Our minds will be attached to irregularities Miss *** with the finest eyes in England af∣fects to be near sighted and Lady ***** a most charming figure drawn by elegance and  dressed by gracechuses to appear round shoul∣dered  Sir ****** one of our most eloquent speak∣ers and a gentleman of amazing learning believes he can spin a top better than any other man in England and wants to have upon it  The Rt ***** who has seven of the finest children perhaps in Christendom has impaired his estate in purchasing and preparing butterflywings to line his study in imitation of tapestry And Mr *** the most eminent attorney in Great Britain employs his whole time in gudgeon fishing  This Mr Warner abovementioned had an oddity of temper which is uncommon among theatrical managers He never looked upon his people to be off the Stage as good as himself he never chose to countenance them as acquain∣tance or be familiar with them as friends  A fortnight or three weeks preceding the Bo∣rough fair he used to have a great levee of peo∣ple in the business although at that instant per∣haps out of employ who would wait upon him to know if he wanted any hands in the acting singing dancing hocus pocus or han∣nock and jannock way  They used at first to come about dinnertime and no person keeps a betterhouse than he does or understands it better there was always something good in the pot or roasting at the fire There would they walk up and down the kitch∣en now glancing at the meat now at the mas∣ter sometimes darting their eyes down de∣sponding into the dripping pan then eagerly expectant lift them up again to the boiler and  then they would strut across the kitchen and spout and say  to be or not to be  and Jemmy would laugh and whisper me saying  not to be eat by them colls I assure you  Some of these passages I was remarking to Mr Warner and we were thinking of old af∣fairs and I just had told him of the drippingpan and the tragedy and comedy people as Mr Zaphaniel and the dancingmaster came in we went up one pair of stairs and there I was shewn MASTER EDWARD and MISS ANN walking arm in arm up and down the Skettlealley  The HISTORY of MISS ANN  YOU see Mr Poet observed the Dancingmaster you see there that is Miss NANCY she's a very desirable girl faith as showey a figure as it is possible to represent  I owned her figure was extremely agreeable  I protest Mr Zaphaniel replied she is come∣ly amongst the daughters of delight yea she is fair as the fairest females of JudahShe is more precious to my sight than the rose of Sharon or the snowdrops of Damascus ve∣rily my friends my heart beateth to behold her and I would sooner chuse to have her within my fold than both my fists full of the gold of ophir  DANCINGMASTER  This lady appeared first as a public performer at Sadler's Wells for some years before she had performed with the public but never until then theatrically As she was extremely agreeable in her figure and the novelty of her dancing added to it with her excellence in the executi∣on she soon grew to be a favourite with the town and the ensuing season Nancy was engaged at CoventGarden Playhouse She be∣came vastly celebrated admired imitated and followed by every body which is always the consequence when once a lady of pleasure be∣comes the fashion  The first night of her performance at the New House our hero whose soul was ever agitated by love and ambition confessed himself her ad∣mirer  Let me do Master Edward this justice to praise him for his emulation in so spirituously aiming at every new part in comedy which Mr Gar∣rick is famous for Yet as every biographer is supposed to be the friend of the genius whose life he celebrates I would advise Master Ed∣ward rather hereafter to strike out a new cast of acting for himself where comparisons could not be made In justice to his merit it must be allowed he who is capable of being the master Stephen the Miser c c has a suf∣ficiency of comic abilities to be without buf∣foonery grimace or mimickry a capital actor and be held in a much higher point of character than what at present he is Although now he is the drole and comical one of the town and  pleases them with his performances it is in his power not only to give pleasure to an audience but to gain their esteem and difficult as that part may be to act it is worth his while to study it  Edward was in love to all the degrees sallies and dependencies of desparationThe lady observed her conquest and enjoyed it She knew her man had heard that to his girls and his gamesters he did not mind what money he threw away He was a trout worth tickling and therefore returned him look for look  Emboldened by this eye language he began to contrive a scheme for enlarging the cor∣respondence He wished to talk with her but he wanted words he wished to write to her but he wanted letters therefore employed his landland Mr THOMAS PHILIPS  of whom more hereafter  to be his secretary  I cannot forbear mentioning a piece of ingra∣titude of Neddy's to that old gentleman who behaved in this affair extremely friendly to him and yet so far can gaming absorb all grateful principles that Edward has betted twenty to five his landlord won't live until Ladyday next The conceit of such a bett has had a violent ef∣fect upon the mind of the old gentleman Mr Pond also to the best of my remembrance has such another wager I have not indeed a syllable to say against Mr Pond he is as fair a sportman as ever stepped up the stand and pays his betts as punctual as if he was a man of quality Yet after he has said done to such a bett what business had he to drive Mr Philips from Greg's coffeehouse it seems as if it was designed as a heartbreaking stroke since to  be debarred from that academy of universal con∣versation must be as great a damp upon the spirits of any of the curiosi as it was to Bussy Rabutin to be banished from the French court  When Miss Ann became a principal dancer she had a friend a female one I mean to wait upon her behind the scenes to watch her moti∣ons and take care of her steps  This duenna was her relation and therefore had a more than ordinary care of her charge least detraction should be malicious  The ogles which  Neddy  the drole and  Nancy  the desireable reciprocally interchanged alarm∣ed the old lady guardianess She trembled at the danger Nancy's honour was in and soon as they came home that evening thus began the most careful governante  I once thought yes that I did Miss Nancy how you had a better spirit and a more politer taste than to coquet it with a playermercy upon us what is our family fallen too if this is the case and so you're in love with the fellow are you I say love too I'll tell you what child when once any fine woman like you con∣descends to give her company to people of fa∣shion who can pay her well for it why there's no harm donebut for a lady to fall in love it's just like a tradesman dealing all upon honour they had better shut up shop at once my dear  Miss  ANN  Lord Madam how you talk as if I ever loved a man in my life you know I never did and yet you know I have had as fine men  as ever put laced cloaths on and did I ever love any of um how should I I have had too many and seen too much of them to love them▪ Indeed I used to tell them I did what then that was no more than rehearsing one's part you know as to lovewhy now Madam you know you have gone out a nursing and have a sweet creature it was and yet at the same time it was ready to make you sick Why so it is with us girls of the town we kiss men and fondle them and make babies of them and tell them they are sweet creatures and yet at the same time they make us almost sickwhat then it don't last long and though the service may be hard it's soon over and if the wages are good what does it signify  GOVERNESS  But who would receive wages from a player  Miss  ANN  Why now didn't you but yesterday read in one of those sixpenny blue covered books there that we take in monthly and a charming libry they make that's certain how that a great Roman Catholic Emperor laid a tax upon peoples making water and how his son found fault with him for it because it was a base thing and didn't the father as the book says take up a piece of gold that was gathered by the tax and bid his son examine if it smelt of chamberly So madam what does it signify if we girls can but get money who it  comes from do you think my mercer can tell one body's guinea from another  GOVERNESS  Yes child but what guineas can you get from a showman  Miss  ANN  Why mun he no more minds money than I do modesty but will give it away as uncon∣cerned as I do my haircombings Besides ma'am the case is this I shan't always look so well as I do now for these cursed washes I use for all they do give one's neck and face such a fine whiteness yet they make one's skin in a morn∣ing look all crumpled like a washerwoman's fingers and turns one's flesh as yellow as a peasepudding Now you must know that this young fellow Ned will always have a good sa∣lary from the Playhouse because he is devilish comical to be sure tho' he has not all the wit in the world neitherwhat then the fitter for my purposeif I can but persuade him to marry mewhy shouldn't I be made an honest woman of and I will too I have got some money and I'd give it all if I could but be made an honest woman for it don't signify talking but I can no more look a modest woman in the face as I should do than I can say my prayers I wonder what's the meaning of it however I don't despair 'cause I know Ned's but a Nico∣demus and a girl may get him to do any thing we are to sup together to night  GOVERNESS  Are ye then I suppose you are to go to bed together to night but not at my house Nanno by all that's honourable I never will con∣sent to so undervaluement a connectionA player lye with my relationno as to your having an intrigue with a man of fashion why it's what no lady need be ashamed of and in∣deed few arefor that's natural and therefore no sin in it but shall any of our family ever stoop so low as to lay the cloath for an actor's ordinary I detest such business But see there's Harris from the Shakespear at the door some gentleman has sent for you I'll lay my life on'tgo to him in the Lord's name but never let me hear any more about Mr what's his name  Miss not being willing to anger her gover∣ness like other prudent young ladies was de∣termined to hear her guardianess's opinion and follow her own She went to the Shakespear where her impatient lover Ned waited for her  Thus began the amour Mr WARNER then bringing up dinner prevented any more being said upon that subject  Master EDWARD and Miss ANN dined in the next room the apartments only divided by a slit deal as we were impatient to be earwitnesses at least of their conversation we dis∣patched our ordinary with such expedition that both their dinner and ours were over together when for the benefit of observation Mr Zapha∣niel made three or four peepholes in the parti∣tion  through which we could see the underwrit∣ten Dramatis Personae  EDWARD  ANN  JEMMY  MRS MOLLY  As I was determined to be punctual in their con∣versation I took it down in short hand at the very time the dialogue was uttered as follows  Miss  ANN  Lord Ned now don't be so foolish as to pull one's hair out of order so I am sure you men not one in a hundred of you know how it is to treat a woman as you should do Lord don't paw one so  Master  EDWARD  Paw one sothere's a pretty speech indeedpaw one sowhat now is that polite language Miss  Miss  ANN  May be soI hope you don't set up for a critic do you Sir  Master  EDWARD  Suppose I do ma'am  Miss  ANN  Why then I suppose you do wrong Sir because you should never find fault with other peoples words until you can tell your own letters Sir  Master  EDWARD  I can always tell  your  letters Nan when you send to me for money  Miss  ANN  Yes but who reads them for you your landlord doesn't he  Master  EDWARD  Your landlord doesn't he why I neither va∣lue my landlord nor you into the bargain  Miss  ANN  Nor any body else Ned that ever did you any favours I will say that for you your gra∣titude and my virtue are two very fine things if any body could but tell where to find them There was  what's his name  who wrote the droll for you which you thought proper to call your droll and made you your  Dish of all Sorts  and the  Day of Taste  and several comic songs which have been of such service to you in your benefits both in town and in the coun∣try how did your serve him did'nt you ex∣spose  him falsely and scandalously and strove by what you said of him publickly in some of the infamous bawdyhouses that you frequent to render him contemptible And he had never done any thing to my knowledge to merit such treatmentI wish he would write some∣thing about you I wish he would nothing he could print against you could be half so bad as the abuse you have loaded him with in my hearing Neddy but he don't value you nor I neitherthat for you that for you and  she snapped her fingers as if playing upan the castanets or like Caledonian ladies figuring country dances  Master  EDWARD  There's a pretty piece of St Giles's music for you there's a gentlewoman's action for you  Miss  ANN  No Ned I lost that character as soon as I let you have any thing to say to me  Master  EDWARD  I think myself as good a gentleman  Miss  ANN  What because you wear a laced coat and belong to the playhouses why so does  Newgate Tom  and he bought his finery secondhand  oo the same way that you came by your wit  your jokesyou have them all at secondhand  now  the maker won't furnish you any longeryou a gentleman yes when a night man's cart may pass for a nobleman's chariot  Master  EDWARD  If you never was to have any people to trade with you but gentlemen you would have very few customers  Miss  ANN  I had one too many when I took you for my chapman  Master  EDWARD  Well let's have no more of your nonsense  Miss  ANN  As much sense as yourself Ned and come of a better familynow there's a spiteful fel∣low for you to throw a glass of wine in my faceO you maliciousbut I'll do for you  and then she clapped her hands together as if she was applauding him for his acting  I'll expose you sirrah I'll tell Squintum of you yes that I will Mr Jew's Face though for that matter he knows as many tricks as you do for to my knowledge the saints at the tabernacle can humm as well as any player in England they are a parcel of sad dogs and for your part Ned you are  At that moment Master Edward's clench'd fist like a battering ram was drove hard ho∣rizontally  against her mouth which blow would have been repeated quick as the change of a pantomime trick had not the rest of the company interposed  Soon as the suffering lady recovered the use of her speech bursting into tears she declared that the villain wanted to spoil her face be∣cause she should not get her bread any longer as she ought to doFor you know Jemmy  addressing herself to the landlord and still crying  a girl upon the town when she has lost her beauty is like a toyshop having its show glass stole away but by G  Mrs  MOLLY  Oh don't swear my dear creature consider it is the Lord's day and such a thing as an oath shocks me Christ what conscience must those people have who break any of the com∣mandments  Miss  ANN  Lord Madam I don't want to be taught a∣bout conscience I believe my conscience and your's too madam if they were hung upon a hedge to dry no body would think them worth stealing  Mrs  MOLLY  Madam I suppose that I may have as much conscience as my betters  Page  Miss  ANN  But if you have not more than most of them Lord help you Madamsee how that fel∣low stands grinning theredon't hold him Jemmylet him come oncurse me if I don't box himI'll beat some conscience into himso stand clear for if I don't give him something to make him remember me may I never know what a guinea is again  In a hurry she pulled off her treble ruffles with trembling fingers twitched from her waist the deep flounced apron threw her garnet edged cap upon the floor and in amazonian attitude flourishing her fists with hornpipe step she advanced against her adversary who stood in beargarden position with horrid grin as  Satan  encountred the seraph  Abdiel  The lady's locks unfilleted fell down her back dangling like the dropping tresses of a sign painted mermaidHE bareskulled bruiser likeand now the belligerant pair ad∣vanced within fingers reach of each other  OH FOR THAT WARNING VOICE  But what signifies wishing for it that CHURCHILL'S a very illnatured monopolist and won't part with a note of it  Come then thou stimulator and inspirer of all prosaic scribblers who like me jumble words together unmusical unmeaning inac∣curate inelegant and indifferent SPIRIT of RIBALDRY assist me to sing or to relate  How Nancy seized Ned by the collar with one hand and with the other drew from the top of his forehead four perpendicular lines along his face blood following every scratchBut as she passed her fingers down two of them were caught between his teeth she shriek∣ed he bit his fist fell furious on her face his other hand seized her hair and with head bent back and swelled out throat down on the floor she fell pulling Ned upon her and by the fall her fingers were releas'd  But as it often happens in states that those who are IN shall be OUT and those who are OUT shall be IN the nose of Mr Edward pitched between the upper and lower rows of ivory which adorned Miss Nancy's mouth Quick as a shark's snap she fixed them in the gristle Ned roared like a whipped schoolboy She pinned him fastshe  Enter in a violent hurry the waiter to Mr Zaphaniel and his company  WAITER  Gentlemen there is somebody's footman below axing after an author  down stairs hur∣ried the Editor  FOOTMAN  Sir you must come to our house this moment  Great people are to be obeyed implicitly Not a reply to be utteredBecause  PASSIVE OBEDI∣ENCE  is elected footstoolmaker to  LADY FA∣SHION  Away I went along with the servant running trotting walking panting and almost breath∣less arrived at the palace of my patron  The footman informed his honour that the man who made books was below  very well let him wait  So I did about three hours and then had the happiness of a command to attend there next morning delivered from the most respec∣table personage himself who condescended to give me that order  viva voce  as I stood bow∣ing at his chariot door before he pulled the glass up  This postponing or delay in my affair with my patron arose not from his haughtinessor any other supercilious practise with which geniuses are generally treated when put into trammels by their superiors  My BENEFACTOR my MAECENAS my MAG∣NUS APOLLO had too much regard for the  Arts  and  Sciences  to use me or any other pro∣fessor in so contemptuous a manner  But the reason I had not an immediate au∣dience was  An ARTIST from  Siberia  having met with the celebrated tooth and pinion scheme of Mr JO∣NATHAN SWIFT for making verses mechani∣cally improved upon the hint and construct∣ed an engine for the universal erudition of man∣kind respecting ARTS and SCIENCES  This piece of mechanism being just imported was brought to my patron for his countenance and inspection just after the footman came for me He saw at once its most amazing utility and cried out BRAVO before one wheel went about  The rudiments of learning the judgment of scientific taste the excellence of all genius the mistery art plan design projection sec∣tion elevation and estimate of all professions callings and occupations without the gift of invention the labour of study or the benefit of a fine understanding this machine explained and taught instantly by the new discovered principle of INTUITION and in half an hour's time the purchaser became an universal master of arts as easily as pretty miss plays tunes on a hand organ  It was very dear and therefore no persons but people of fashion being able to become pur∣chasers it kept the knowledge of every thing confined to the polite part of the world and as every thing is to be estimated by its worth and as the worth of every thing is only what it will sell for at market and as no body but rich peo∣ple can afford to buy every thing and as every thing a man buys is his own therefore only peo∣ple of estate family title or pension can be said to be possessed of the arts and sciences which they purchased in the manner above related by this ENGINE  The name of it is TECHNICATHOLICAUTOMATO PAN TOPPIDON  The fabricator met with that encouragement it behoves the rich to afford the ingenious  The truly delicate made a point of encourag∣ing so extraordinary an artist especially as he was not of this nation's growth but imported  Persons of breeding observed their children threw away a horrid deal of time at school and as they could judge by themselves that they  were very little the better for it Nothing could therefore be so immensely convenient or in∣deed so elegant a piece of furniture as a clock∣work schoolmaster that would teach grown people of fashion to be persons of reading and taste while their hair was dressing  One  objec∣tion was made to the engine which was that it could not be so proper a thing to vent one's spleen on as a living creature because it is the ultimate of taste among the very best bred to behave rudely to those ingeni∣ous who have only their own merit to re∣commend them more especially if the artist should by the misconduct of parents and cru∣el decree of providence be born in ENGLAND  For the truth of this and other as horrid particulars I appeal to the behaviour of of all the connoisseurs who keep coachesAs to what any person else is pleased to prate about it's not to the purpose because no man has a right to speak in company unless he is qualifi∣ed by much money or sanctified by court in∣terest Then he may express his contempt for his own countrymen with proper consequence  Sir  Minikin Pinfly  at the Opera last week was observing to  Lady Fidgill her ladyship hav∣ing informed the Baronet that the great premium was given to the gentleman who had found out the art of preventing black lead combs from being brit∣tle  In an affair of so much consequence to the nation in general as black lead combs he thought that the contriver could not be too much encouraged especially if he was a fo∣reigner because I do assure your ladyship that English artists are generally immensely imper∣tinent  Lady  FIDGILL  Frightfully so pon onner Sir Minikin and then they are vastly ungenteel and such slovens  Sir  MINIKIN  Detestable my LadyTo be sure I don't trouble my head about pictures or statures or books but a gentleman must have such things for furniture and if I send to any of these ar∣tists to do a job belonging to those things if he's a foreigner the dear creature is so delicate so submissive and such vast good companyI vow I dote upon them But if you send for any of the English brutes of geniuses why tru∣ly they are so saucy they won't dine but at what table they please and are so impudent as to pretend to offer to give their opinions to one of us as if such common bred creatures could know things so well as we do  Lady  FIDGILL  They are hideous creatures and I can't bear to see a genius without it is at Sadlers Wells and to be sure there they are very well upon the wire or tumbling or dancing hornpipes but for your paintingengraving peopleor your housebuildingarchitects or mathemI detest such horrid barbarous names but in∣deed the whole crew of creatures who know one nonsense or another about the arts and sci∣ences are only mobpositive mobI'm sure on't specially those born this side Berwickthey even have the effrontery with their stuff about understanding and learning and fancy and wit and humour to conceit their senses  are as good as ours who are persons of distinc∣tion and scorn to be beholden to any such low bred mechanical acquirings as they value them∣selves upon  An interview between  Author  and  Patron  Next morning being introduced to my most respectable Lord submissively I made my obey∣sance in low bows according to the eastern wor∣ship as soon as the door of his apartment unfold∣ed for me to appear before him  He beckoned me to advance I did bending at every step and as I approached the carpet where his armed chair was placed in which he reclined I was awed I considered myself in the time of the Roman mythology entering in∣to the Inner Temple where the tutelar deity was enshrined  The good the great the wonderful man all affability in his smile all condescension in his gesture was thus most graciously pleased to an∣nounce his will unto  me  one of his unworthy dependants  N B  As his honour spoke to me he was putting a piece of brass wire into a guineapig's ear on ac∣count of some philosophical experiment I suppose  CONNOISSEUR  Your wife Mr Trip is a vast intelligent being and one for whom I have an immense regard  I bowed indeed I bowed at every word I had conferred upon me for by the observati∣ons I have been empowered to make in the po∣litest grandest assemblies of my superiors I have noted a bow and a smile and a curtsy and a  simper are the general answers and explicati∣ons to almost every address  My patron having set down the guineapig pulled out his earpicker and as he used it thus delivered himself  You are going Mr Trip to enjoy a happi∣ness which very few geniuses ever enjoyed or is it fit they should You will be provided for ac∣cording to your merit by having a place but it must be accepted on certain conditions  AUTHOR  May it please your generosity you may be certain of my coming into any conditions I hope you will find I possess as proper a ductility of mind as any other writer your mightiness has been pleas'd to make pensionary  CONNOISSEUR  Your speak Sir as every man of sense ought to speak By men of sense I don't mean those wretches who pretend to be clever without hav∣ing shoes to their feet or dare to arraign the conduct of their betters yet have not as much earth of their own as will serve to bury them  They  Mr Trip should be punished  they  shall starve for their contumacy but be  you  conform∣able  you  shall find your account in it You are a man of sense your understanding I don't doubt is  clear ripe  and  strong  that is  clear  enough to distinguish what is for your own in∣terest  ripe  enough to be ready for any thing and  strong  enough not to be biass'd by any of those beggarmaking bubbles of public spirit  Love gratitude friendship freedom those and other such like terms Mr Trip are only tubs toss'd out for the whale and which the hydra MOB call the harmonies and sympa∣thies of the soul  Next you are to take care that in your future writings you rail against the liberty of printing call it the licentiousness of the press  You are also to endeavour to inculcate the doctrine of nonresistance and to argue stre∣nuously for the eligibility of arbitrary power  Lastly you must give up all your friends relations and acquaintance to me Mr Trip  AUTHOR  Your honour may be assured that not one of your honour's writers can give up more for your service than I will or do more any how Because thank God Providence has bless'd me with as copious a talent for abuse as for panegyrick I know may it please your honour and with all respect to your universal scientific conceptions I know as well how to vilify as to compose a dedication and if my play  CONNOISSEUR  Tomorrow Mr Trip you shall go under instructions for a foot walk in the excise for no genius shall be unrewarded by me such I mean who are modest and know themselves But as you will now be settled for lifeyou must relinquish all acquaintance with what are called cleverfellows they are dangerous com∣panions rebellious reipublican spirits who  have the insolence not only to think about us but even are profane enough to give their opi∣nions concerning how things are and how things should be However  you  have a better way of thinking and therefore keep company only with those who have nothing to do and as little to say and taste the benefits of that tranquil in∣difference which hardly any but those who have their fortunes made for them are ever ac∣quainted with  I bowed to the ground I bowed and hasten∣ed home happy to think I should soon be able to lead an uniform steady and obedient life go to bed get up dine sup and so forth always in one way at such and such stated hours and never make any attempts at wit or humour or concern myself with the merits and distresses for the future of my fellowcreatures because I should arrive soon at that glorious state of insipidity and dissipation in which I had often seen many of what are called the gay part of the world indulge themselves  Being thus provided for by his excellency I humbly take my leave of the public sorry I could not finish this work but more sorry for some other of my works wherein I have endea∣voured to be witty and comical for which I most submissively beg pardon of all gentlefolks in general from the highest of the betitled un∣to the lowest of their doorkeepers and promise for the future to be as dull as the best of them  Yet well as I can to expiate in some mea∣sure for former offences I propose a scheme to prevent authors attempting either humour or wit in what they write for the future  viz  As some part of the army is to be disbanded if those persons who in the camp are the hang∣men of the army and called the provost guard and if the most active of the drummers who have had the most practise in whipping during the late war were not to be sent adrift but in∣corporated in the regiment of reforming consta∣bles this scheme with the other common me∣thods of  turn out and starve scoundrel what's your wife and ten children to me  would preserve the POLICE of this kingdom for the future in proper subordination and writers on the wrong side of the question be taught respect  FAREWELL  N B  The proprietors of the copy of this history having been at a great expence for Plates and Authors hope the Town will encourage the assiduity with which they have laboured to find out a person capable of finishing this work because by the first Editor's preferment this DRAMATIC PERFORMANCEa work so very essential towards bettering the understanding of every reader whose penetration can unaenigmatise the foregoing pages must have been post∣poned  sine die  The loss which that would have been to the public can never be estimated  An Account of the Continuation of this Work  AN errandboy belonging to the printer vulgarly and irreligiously called a Devil hearing that for want of an author no more copy could be obtained to complete this volume told his master he knew a gentleman who lodged in his mother's back garret the author and devil being bedfellows who the boy said he was sure would finish it because he had of∣ten heard the gentleman say that as far as a pen and ink could go he would undertake any thing  The Devil being agent for both parties a bar∣gain was immediately struck between publisher and author whose name is CANNON common∣ly called CAPTAIN CANNON on account of his inventive faculty or allegorical manner in which he was won't to express himself  This person appeared to be one of the EX∣TRAORDINARIES OF THE TIMES by his ar∣gumentatives against the late  Orator Henley  In those altercations the loquacity of Cannon was so conspicuous he became a favourite a∣mong all the people of exquisite taste particu∣larly a mountebank doctor who admired the lad for the facility of his physical and metaphy∣sical replies and determined even without the least interest being made in the young fellow's behalf  strange as it may seem  to encourage so promising a genius therefore constituted him immediately his MERRY ANDREW  A widow lady whose spouse had suffered the severity of the law because he endeavoured upon  a belligerant principle to investigate the uni∣versal axiom GET MONEY fell in love with the Merry Andrew for eating fire and tow she was then in equipage by a very famous mini∣sterial writer therefore the lady had power to recommend or introduce Cannon to her friend who made him his amanuensis  Under this master he became proficient in politics and was properly initiated in the grand mystery of mysteries or the true art of prefer∣ment writing viz to DEIFY the INS and make DEVILS of the OUTS  The Methods he made use of in his Pickleherring capacity were of infinite service to him in his political one He was also a very good posturemaster and that brought him in∣to great esteem among his superiors and he had hints that he should be encouraged equal to the most celebrated of the retained writers  He grew noted among the notified he was supposed to have great interest with some people It was whispered about he was in the secret therefore when in company he abstracted him∣self accordingly  He began to consider himself and reflect that such a writer as he was and engaged in such connections was liable to meet with a sudden change of circumstances either for the better or worse according to the weight ba∣lance or prejudice of party  Upon a CHARIOT and the PILLORY he daily meditated as they were both particular exalta∣tions and what he knew had been bestowed up∣on different persons very often for the same action  Conscious of his own importance he formed to himself a new system of behaviour and as∣sumed wore and bore an authorlike conse∣quence  He had his shoes cleaned every day and wrote E S Q R after his name The wai∣ters at the coffeehouses made bows to him and the landlord at the Shakespear shook him by the hand He had the liberty of the scenes gave his opinion in the greenroom and told every body how many days in the week he dined with my lord  Then he wore a sword and a snuffbox be∣gan to pity poor writers hired a laced coat and looked about him  At last he condescended to tell the town him∣self that he was a man of wit and learning and folks pointed at him as he went along the streets saying  That's  HE  He drew his pen for preferment and waged scurrilous warfare against all his betters who were out of favour He fought blushless through the field of faction He mangled the over∣thrown he despoiled the departed of their ho∣nours VENALITY crowned his temples with a brazen frontlet and trampling over the fal∣len worthies she led him to the shrine of SE∣CRET SERVICES where the  Oracle  assured him protection and reward  At that time there were numbers to provide for who had been true servants of his HONOUR and for whom when no more vacancies could be made new places must be contrived  This was the captain's case He had the promise of being INSPECTOR GENERAL of the MILK OFFICE within the bills of mortality  to prevent so wholesome a commodity from a∣dulteration  The author of this salutary scheme was an Arabian who came over here in Oliver's time to get a patent for it because foreigners always are more studious for our good and study more for the benefit of this nation than the English can do or indeed dare do for themselves  But the Arabian was discovered to be in the Tartar interest because he endeavoured to sub∣stitute mares milk instead of cows to make us brew all our porter from oatmeal and pre∣tended to prove horseflesh more wholesome than ROAST BEEF  This project was thrown aside for several years until particular contingencies occasioned it to be revived as above mentioned and all the proper attendants appointed viz  Tasters who were to be the sons of Freeholders  Clerks These were obliged to be housekeepers  Porters These were obliged to be housekeepers  A Gauger These were obliged to be housekeepers  A Secretary These were obliged to be housekeepers  A Deputy These were obliged to be housekeepers  The Inspector general He was allowed to be any thing With him was joined A COMPANY OF ASSISTANTS  Composed of  Two Apothecaries  Two Dairywomen  Two Experimental Philosophers  One Buttermelter  Two Spectaclemakers  Two Physicians  Two Wetnurses  A Clysterpipe borer  A Metaphysician And  The Curds and Wheykeeper  The multiplicity of friends which some∣body or somebody else had to oblige procrasti∣nated the institution which made Cannon about the year relinquish all his inspecto∣rial hopes and be contented with the head la∣bour of an author mantaining himself by the sweat of his brow as poets or prose people should do  During the winter season he picks up a pret∣ty living with several more such subaltern genii by putting together magazines and memorandum books penning murders making rebuses and singing songs for both parties and writing in newspapers against the players  Yet I must do those  prose writers  the justice to declare that they would not do so if they could help it  They acknowledge it is wrong to prejudice the town against any performer because his bread may be lost by itWhat thenthey had rather all the world should starve than themselves and starve they must if their works did not go off and they can only send abuse to market well knowing scurrility is always saleable depraved appetites delight in  things uncleanly and some virtuosi make col∣lections of snakes toads spiders monsters deformities dark lanthorns and poison'd ar∣rows  In the summer months these writers retreat into the country mantain themselves very decently and indeed reputably by making hay and harvest work  N B  The publisher thus far has taken the liberty to premise in behalf of the second un∣dertaker of this performance who now begs to be indulged in a word or two from himself  CANNON  To the READER  IT is with reluctance that I agreed to finish the Memoirs of this Comedian because I am not in amity with any Theatrical Professorshaving met with severe usage from the superiors of that Fraternity  At the age of I did a Tragedy not acted it I mean for I was always above being a player but wrote one which had not the least bank∣ruptcy among the unities and therefore I as∣sured myself I must have great credit for my manufactory  As to making interest to have my tragedy re∣commended though I was told it was the on∣ly way to go to work yet being bigotted too much to the excellence of my piece I despised such advice and was assured within my own  mind that it would be put into rehearsal by the manager upon his first reading it  But  multa cadunt  c  However by using the same chandlersshop I got acquainted with a young lady whose sister was dresser to a very celebrated actress  She invited me to drink tea with her sister the dresser to whom I read my play who approved of it mightily because as she observed there was not much dressing in it  I had the honour of being introduced to the lady her mistress who received me with pe∣cular deportment which as Gil Blas observes most of the ladies theatrical put on to strangers especially if the visitors are foot people  She stared at me when I came into her room so much that I was prodigiously out of coun∣tenance a fault of which even detraction will deny I am often guilty  But recollecting it is the common look which ladies bear both on and off the stage when they condescended to SEE their inferiors I be∣gan to come to myself  After I had been surveyed as much as she thought it consistent with her dignity to ob∣serve me she tinkled a silver handbell and on the maid's entrance the lady in a most delicate accent ordered her servant to take the footstool which the actress was then resting one foot uponcarry it there  thus the lady pointing to the cor∣ner of the room ordered  put  my  footstool there that the man  pointing to me  may set upon it and read his play to me and bring my eaude∣luce and my aether bottle  Then in the most engaging attitude she re∣clined herself upon the couch on which she had before been seated and looked like one of those fine figures at the print shops of Venus or a Madona or some singing or dancing lady in a repose And those graving and etchings are done by some great man or after some great man's manner as we are told in the ca∣talogues by  auctioneers  and  picturedealers  who have such universal capacities it is impossible for them to be mistaken  They are the loadstones of connoisseurship The only judges of genius Counsellors of taste Determiners of merit Interpreters of science and leadingstrings baits bits curbs spurs whips wheels levers pullies and primum mo∣biles for every lady and gentleman of fortune who chuse to be trammell'd into taste and be ambled about as connoisseur's hobbyhorses  Before I had read a page of my play the lady interrupted me finding great fault with my tones with my emphasis and my accents  Swinging herself off the couch she arose with a graceful dignity becoming a Penelope the gold fringe of her slippers playing to her feet her silk train sweeping along the carpet then flourishing her white handkerchief the lady spoke three or four speeches of Calista to show me how people ought to deliver tragedy Af∣ter that when she had again seated herself as she looked into the lid of her patchbox she enquired if I had seen her play all her charac∣ters and which I liked her best in  My reply was  for I had a hint given me not to be sparing of compliments  that where every one  was excellent it was impossible to perceive an inferiority  She smiled with the utmost complacency upon me she took my MSS promised me it  should  be done and suffered me kneeling to sa∣lute the back of her hand as I took my leave but meeting at the door a person very richly dressed I was ordered to walk in again  This visitor to the lady was in a velvet coat embroidered a gold tissue waistcoat embroi∣dered and every other part of his apparel equal∣ly rich I took particular notice of his watch chain it was remarkably long and as remark∣ably filled for I counted no less than ten vari∣ous seals and toys in different shapes upon it  The gentleman was a very eminent haber∣dasher and a great friend of the lady's as I heard afterwards He stared at me also full as much as I had been stared at beforethen turn∣ing to the gentlewoman he asked her in very ill pronounced French Who the Devil I was  She replied an author  I thought so he replied  still in French  and swore a great oath at the same timeI thought he was a shabby genius of some sort or ano∣therbut now my angel we'll have some fun with this fellow I ha'ant roasted a scribbler a great while for damn me if these authors not one in a hundred of um have any thing to say to a gentleman as they should do because they are blockheads and ought to be caned kicked or dragged through a horsepond for what busi∣ness have they to think about their betters  I would not discover to him or the lady that what they said in French was understood by  me but allowed him to the length of his tether without interruption and he accordingly assum∣ed all that contemptuous behaviour that un∣worthy insolence which the wearers of fine cloaths conceit they have a power to bestow on the wearers of plain ones  Hear what their honours  ALL  say  Every person must be a scoundrel a Lyar piti∣ful illiterate damned contemptible despicable filthy fulsome horrid vile vulgar base odious and one of the  MOB  who is not a person of fortnne fa∣shion or familyvide the world  The fine dressed gentleman haberdasher feating himself by the lady his leg across her lap put∣ting one hand to his side and with the other chinking the seals at his watch chainyawn'd then leaned backyawn'd againthen bending suddenly forward fixed his eyes full upon me seeming as Falstaff says  to awe with a stare  GENTLEMAN HABERDASHER  And so Sirthis lady tells me you have got  yawn  that you have got  looking at his shirt bosom buckle  that you have

quarrel instead of drawing their swords go to snicker de snee with one another  LADY  Dear Mr Caddus my GodI am im∣mensely ashamed of you how can you shock a gentleman so  GENT HABERDASHER  Shock the gentleman no faith he knows too much of the world for that and I keep company at the Bedford so often with the best writers in Englandthat sure my dear I must know how to behave to authors Well Sir and so at Leyden you say I suppose you studied the oriental sciences there  AUTHOR  The oriental languages Sir  GENT HABERDASHER  No Sir I mean the oriental sciences I believe I am too much acquainted with both  sciences and languages to mistake one for t'other The oriental arts and sciences I mean as to the oriental languages I re'd um all and  every one  from the teutonick down to old Ho∣mer's Iliad Odyssey and his Telemachus  LADY  Pon my honour Caddy you must have had a vast education my dear to read so much and remember things so  GENT HABERDASHER  Faith I never re'd much po' my onner I was rather a buck at schoolBut I had a quicker way of study I believe than any other fellow ever had in the worldbut a Mr Authorand sodon't you never write no songs  AUTHOR  Sometimes Sir  GENT HABERDASHER  O then we'll have a song come Sir sing one to the lady  AUTHOR  Indeed Sir I can't singI can't indeed Sir  GENT HABERDASHER  Nay Sir but I insist on it to oblige the lady  to whom he then said in French  I know the fellow can't sing 'cause I've heard him at∣tempt it among Comus' court but that is the fun on't we'll make him expose himself  LADY    reply'd in French  For God's sake my dear Merchant don't ask him I shall die with his noise I am ex∣piring with the headach already He sing I am certain poor Devil he looks so down in the mouth that he could only hymn the hun∣dred Psalm or a hanging stave for a Tyburn Penitent on an Executionday  GENT HABERDASHER  in French still  Bravo bravissimo my angelyou have more wit than all the worldThen bid him tell us a merry story or desire he'll say something cle∣ver Oh damn it that does for these genuisses at once  LADY  in ditto  He looks so disconsolate he shocks me  GENT HABERDASHER  ditto repeated  Well now you shall have a drole scene my    Then in English  And so Sir I suppose you live by writing  AUTHOR  I endeavour to maintain myself and family Sir by every exertion of my small capacity that honesty and industry will warrant  GENT HABERDASHER  And pray Sir what can you get a year by writing  AUTHOR  As to that Sir  GENT HABERDASHER  Ay as to that SirOh mum a word to the wise is enoughYou are not willing to confess because you are afraid I should want to borrow a hundred of youWhy Sir my credit's pretty good and if you was to lend me a cool thousand I'd give you per cent and an eighth for it I suppose Sir you are too conversant with the stocks to be igno∣rant what that is a year  LADY  Lord my dear  GENT HABERDASHER  In French encore  Nay my angel let me alone for upon my soul if gentlemen were not now and then thus to mortify these fellows and make them ashamed of themselves for not having money there would be no bearing them I have a great mind to show him an eighteen shilling piece and a guinea and ax him what's the difference I'll hold six to four he don't guess the first time  LADY  Let me perish then but you will be immense∣ly wrong and barbarously absurd you see he turns pale and red every minute I'm sure he's hurt enough already  GENT HABERDASAER  Well mum then I suppose Sir in your play you have been critically exact in the pre∣servation of the unities and you have seen what Aristotle and Bossu says upon that subject for that's what I blame Shakespear for the fel∣low had a fine knack at metaphor faith but he never understood the unities now if he had but have been a scholar and could have read what Aristotle and Bossu says  AUTHOR  Aristotle to the best of my remembrance says  GENT HABERDASHER  Ay I know as well as you do whatbut that's nothing now to the purpose what either Aristotle or his Brother the Stagyrite  says  I speak how things should be  done  Dam it there's nobody but gentlemen that can either write or judge for that matter I wish it was not quite so damned scandalous to be either an author or a scho∣lar There are about twelve of us that would and could restore the Drama to that original purity which the divine Plato the preceptor of Socra∣tes and Plautus says the stage ought to be preserved in  AUTHOR  Under favour Sir I did not think Plato was much attach'd to dramatic poetry any more than he was to Homer whom I can't think he uses so well  GENT HABERDASHER  What doesn't Plato use Homer wellthat's false Mr Author you must allow me to tell you I beg pardon but I know betterwhy Plato is the best friend Homer ever had  AUTHOR  But I mean Sir that Plato who was  disci∣ple  to Socrates  GENT HABERDASHER  Pho pho Mr Author we an't to be humm'd so neither you're devilishly out there never was but one Plato and he taught Socrates all he know'd and if you have a mind for a bett you shall have your sum on't This Plato my dear Betsy was cotempre with the first primi∣tive fathers  LADY  Pray my dear were they poets or play∣writers  GENT HABERDASHER  No my dear they were what was called the Christian philosophers in opposition to the heathen philosophers and this Socrates we have been talking of he was burned for his religion because he turned christian  LADY  Let me perish my dear if your memory isn't astonishing I shall be jealous by and by that you have so much learning in your head it must prevent you from thinking of me  GENT HABERDASHER  Never by all that's soft I swear  upon which be kissed the lady and turned to me with a look of  happy consequence as much as to tell me what would you give could you do so  I suppose Mr Author that you must have heard of Sophocles and Empedocles  AUTHOR  Yes Sir  GENT HABERDASHER  I re'd all their works at college both their Tragedies and Comedies and though I never look'd into um since I only wish I had a hun∣dred on't that I couldn't say um all by heart with∣out missing an apostrophe And so I suppose you have heard of Terence and Euripides and Lucan's true history Swift stole every line of Gulliver from him to my knowledge  LADY  Well this conversation is to  me  immensely agreeable and dear Caddy you are the most surprising creature  GENT HABERDASHER  My soul's affection I do believe nay with∣out vanity I am sure on't that if I had a mind to't I could have made a greater figure as a scho∣lar or a writer than any on um But  I  was always above such slovenly pedantic notions authors are very well when a man has a mind to make a lady a present of a song or an acros∣  ic why then such fellows are useful because  they take the trouble of composing these things off of a gentleman's hands and books now and then of a rainy day are well enough but at other times they are damned low dull stuffBut I beg pardon Mr Author for talk∣ing French so  AUTHOR  Oh Sir a gentleman has a right to converse in what language he pleases  GENT HABERDASHER  That's true Sir and therefore you and I now will have a little Latin togetherYou remember Horace his advice about discipline  Qui mihi Discipulus Puer es cupis atque doceri  AUTHOR  Sir I beg to be excused but that is not in Horace  GENT HABERDASHER  Not Horacethat's a fine hum indeed not Horace what the Devil sure I know Horace a little better than you I thought I should find you outwhy doesn't he go on and say  Hoc ades huc Amino concupedictis tuo  Up then he started looked in the peer glass and stroked his eyebrows gently  The lady at that instant standing with her back to him told me  Sir this gentleman is a prodigious scholar and you must submit to him in these things I assure you  But I could see that she winked at me while she said this I would have taken the hint but flesh and Blood could not bear to give up  Horoce  to  Qui mihi  Embold∣ened by the lady's signal I told him that per∣haps as gentlemen were not obliged to read so much as authors were his memory might not be  GENT HABERDASHER  O dam it Sir as to that I have a better memory than any man in England and those two lines I spoke are  Horace  's and I'll bet you l on't and out he pulled a green purse seemingly full of money which in his eager∣ness he let fall upon the teatable and broke a cup and saucer belonging to a set of French china that had been presented to the lady by a former lover and which set she told the gentle∣man she would not have had destroyed for pounds  A strange scene of altercation ensued re∣proaches rose high between themuntil the gal∣lant swore several of the most horrid oaths pro∣faneness could put together that he never would speak to her again and hurried out of the room bouncing the door after him as violently as if like Sampson he would shake the house down about us  After the passionate departure of her friend the lady addressed herself to mebut in a man∣ner different from that she received me with  Affectation was awaythe haughtiness of the actress was banished and only the fine woman of affability appeared  Desiring me to sit down with a look that spoke the most delicate sensibility the lady told meI believe Sir I am not the only person in this room whom the hotheaded man that has just left it made uneasy this morning for if I guess right your face told me you under∣stood every thing he said to me in French about you  AUTHOR  Indeed madam I understood every syllable  LADY  I thought so by heavens I thought so I ad∣mire your behaviour Sir and will endeavour to recompence you for the pain of mind I am con∣scious you must have endured too much I feel of that myself what are all diamonds equi∣page fine furniture and elegance of dress when the mind retreating into itself shrinks back ashamed to reflect on the means by which those are purchased Yet I must act the hypocrite I must conformconform to those I hate nay worsebear with rich stupidity applaud with seeming attention arrogant dulness and flat∣ter even fondly flatter indelicate folly Sure of all slavery mine is the worst where the will is not left free what is  Thus she gave vent to her reflections as she walked up and down the room tears following one another down the damask of her cheeks transparent as dew drops upon the rose leaf  At that moment her lover the gentleman haberdasher returned and discovering her cry∣ing run to her took her in his arms forced her to the settee and kneeling down before her begged her to forgive him desiring her to ac∣cept of a ring he held out to her and vowing that had he known his leaving her so abruptly would have so deeply affected her he would not have done it for all the world  The lady's face at this time seemed agitated with astonishment and disdain by turns but I had not an opportunity any longer to observe it Her friend addressing me that instant with  you'll excuse us this morning Mr Writer I shall be glad to see you some other time  Exit  Cannon  The DEDICATORY SPECIMEN  Assured of my play being presented I sought some time for a proper person to dedicate it to one from whom I could expect the greatest advantages one who could do me great ser∣vice if I did but properly apply myself and blazon forth his merits to the WORLD  I had a sufficient quantity of matter by me which I had abstracted from the Greek Ro∣man and French panegyricks and also from the works of most of our best writers upon re∣ligion from whom I had borrowed the choicest phrases which they made use of in their ad∣dresses to the Divinity All these things I had  ready marshalled to appear in rank and file before the public in behalf of my patron as soon as I could find one  Being for some time troubled with bad eyes because the room where I write lay and cook my victuals smokes terribly and as I dread blindness more than any other distemper I gave up all thoughts of baiting my works with great mens defence and turn pension or place fisher  I considered my natural defects ought to be first remedied therefore to the OCCULIST CHE∣VALIER TAYLOR SENIOR I addressed the following dedication  TO THE PRIME GENIUS Of this AGE Professor of the Art of Teaching the

NEDDY c  How Master  Edward  was to be brought up  THE morning following the gossipping scene David and his lady at breakfast consulted together upon the most proper methods for educating their son and heir  DAVID  To be sure and indeed my dear wife I do suppose you will suckle the child yourself  Mrs  LLWHUDDWHYDD  You do then my dear you are guilty of a very indelicate supposition Are ladies of fa∣shion to turn wetnurses and have their heads horridly distracted by the noise of the nursery or vapoured to death with cradlerockings is it taste I ask you my dear upon your ho∣nour is it taste for  me  who come of such a family as I am come from to have a child dang∣ling at my breast as beggars carry their brats Nay is it for  your  honour your wife should appear so you who come of so good a family  DAVID  Yes thank God and good providence I do come of the most ancientest family that ever was born  Mrs  LLWHUDDWHYDD  There my dear you must be wrong im∣mensely wrong upon  my  honour  Your  family may be the more ancienter in England but  my  family is from America we were the ancestors of five original nations of the SENEKAS from whom came the CHIKASAS from whom  came the CATAWAWS from whom came the CHEROKEES  DAVID  But I tell you  my  family is the most ancientest in the world ay and in America to boot for they did go into the Ark as gamekeepers to squire Noah and his worship's son did marry queen Winifred and from whom came the Cadwalladers and from whom came the Tudors and from whom came the Llwhuyddwhuydds  She  Ay and from  my  family came the  Cherokee  and the  Both together  Rikketis  and the  Mohawks  and the  Tomahawks  He  And from mine the  ap Mor∣gaus ap Jenkins ap Rice ap Jones ap    Then they raised their voices at the same time louder and louder until out of breath and black in the face they stood speechless staring at one another like a pair of pitted turkey∣cocks  The lady first recovered and giving her hus∣band a look blended with scorn and reproach that look which fine women know so well how to wear  beating a tatoo with her feet and hitting the teaspoon upon the edge of a saucer  thus she ad∣dressed him  I am sorry Sir that I should so far forget myself as to contend with you about families Upon my honour I shall for the future take care how I ever enter into any such arguments with you and immediately fell into a violent fit of the sullens  Had I but time to analyse that distemper and point out the methods of cure how happy should I  make many husbands but a more interesting scene presents itself  viz  David kneeling at his wife's feet most pa∣thetically begging her to be good to him to speak to him to look at him or let him take hold of her hand  But all his address was vainvain as the petition distress presents vain as the hopes of wit or pretensions of undower'd beauty and virtue  Mr Llwhuddwhuydd was forced before the preliminaries could be signed to give up upon his knees every original branch of his family and allow both lineally and collaterally the superiority of his lady's ancestry  Mrs LLWHUDDWHUYDD  I beg my dear husband now you'll rise I chuse itthere's my hand I offer it to you as a token I don't take any thing illI for∣get and forgive it is taste to do so and I'll suffer death before I would be impolite But pray husband how will you have our child brought up  DAVID  He shall be put to school as soon as he goes into breeches and he shall be kept at learning Latin and Greek for or years to be sure because I will have him a great scholar and then I will bind him prentice  Mrs LLWHUDDWHUYDD  No excuse mehe may be a scholar in∣deed I am not against that because perhaps one day or another such a thing may be taste But I renounce his being 'prentice there's some∣thing so vulgar in it no let him go into the army I am certain that as you have carried  such a number of people of fashion for so many years and as they are under great obligations to you for the care you have always took of them they would not deny you such a small favour as to give your son a commission  DAVID  But for all that my dear I would have him a scholar ay he shall be a genius too  Mrs LLWHYDDWHUYDD  Dear Mr Llwhyddwhuydd I shall faint at the very name of a geniusmy God a ge∣niuswhat shall my eldest son the hopes of two such families as ours be made a genius why at best a genius can but be a jack of all trades and as to his making his fortune by ge∣nius why you may as well say the sun shines at midnight Is not every genius despised by the politest people do not the persons of quali∣ty call creatures so out of contempt my God did you ever know any body of fashion a genius no Mr Llwhuddwhuydd instead of bringing your son up a genius let him be a gen∣tleman let him keep gentlemen company not but I must say if his genius could turn to po∣litics  DAVID  And please God so it shall I will bind him 'prentice to a politician and when he is out of his time he can set up for himself and provide for his relations  Enter  MISS SHRED  and  DOCTOR NOSTRUM  Miss  SHRED  Dear creatures excuse me coming in so sud∣denlybut I promised you know last night to bring a great physician and my friend to prevent your son Mr David ever feeling any  pain or being in any danger while he was cut∣ting his teethgive me leave therefore to in∣troduce the only man in the world that has any sort of skill to youhe knows more than the whole college of doctors put together and they envy'd himso they wou'dn' give him his de∣grees without his undergoing an examinationbut he was above that therefore he went down to Edinburghthere they knew betterhe had his certificate signed at once and now he prac∣tices here in spite of all the London doctorsand what is very wonderful he took physick en∣tirely out of his own head for he never was brought up to it  DAVID  No  DOCTOR  No Sir I discovered it all myselfI scorn'd to be taught I despise all the fellows of the fa∣culty they are ignorant pretenders I have a genius above them all  DAVID  Ay Ay that's the thinga geniusfor a genius is above all learning look you as much as God is above the Devil bless us  DOCTOR  Ladies let me beg your attention while I plainly demonstrate to you the nature of chil∣drens teethcutting  Hyppocrates and Celsus declare infants are subject to the aphthae phoboï diarrhaeas and pa∣roxysms upon cutting their canine teeth Her∣nius tells us of inflammatory tonsils tumours of the parotid glands or saturiasmoi which may be I think the achor Now Aetius says  DAVID  Never mind what Mr Aetius says Sir no more than an cracked chairpole for you do say such fine things yourself about Hyppocrates that I would give all I was worth in the world if I could but talk so learnedly  DOCTOR  This lady's  pulling a phial out of his pocket  this is the MAGNETICA TINCTURA SACRA the LOADSTONE ELIXIR or ANODYNE SPECIFIC With this if you wash the infant's feet it will attract all the morbid foul and peccant humours from the child's head and your son shall cut his teeth as easilyasas  DAVID  Ay it stands to reason as easy as I can cut an onionit mustI have read about load∣stonesand my magazines do tell me about Sir Isaac Newton's attraction Yes yes well God help me I have studied and studied a great deal yet never can be a great man because doctor I have not a genius  Which observation we beg the reader will memento and endeavour to become a genius it is a sure and certain estate to him as for ex∣ample this doctor Nostrum to whom and the rest of the Nostrumists who without under∣standing or experience education or capacity so publickly advertise and vend their unwhole∣some compositions to the detriment of the credu∣lous multitude and reproach of those who have power to prevent such scandalous impostors  FINIS
