 MEMOIRS OF Mrs  Laetitia Pilkington  WIFE TO THE Rev Mr  Matthew Pilkington  Written by HERSELF  Wherein are occasionally interspersed All Her POEMS WITH Anecdotes of several eminent Persons Living and Dead Among others Dean  Swift Alexander Pope  Esq  c c c  DUBLIN  Printed  London  Reprinted and Sold by  R Griffiths  at the  Dunciad  in  Ludgatestreet  and  G Woodfall  at the  King's Arms at CharingCross    TO Sir ROBERT KING Bart  SIR  TIS a very great Plea∣sure to me in an Age where Vice is looked on as a Kind of fashionable Accom∣plishment to hear of one young Gentleman who is not ashamed of being singularly good who has a Tear for Pity and a Hand open as Day for melting Charity without any sinister Views and who has happily united the Fine Gentleman to the Good Christian  These Sir are unfading Honours these shall embalm and sanctify your Name on Earth and when this transient Scene is past be a sweet and acceptable Sacrifice to God  That your Virtues may long adorn and bless this World and receive a full and glorious Re∣compence in the next is the ardent Prayer of  SIR  Your most obliged and most obedient Servant L PILKINGTON  PREFACE  I  T is usual with all Au∣thors to write Prefaces either to beg the Ap∣plause of the Public or else  By Way of filling  To raise their Volume's Price a Shilling  As a most eminent Poet is said to have done  I own if the Merit of any Writer is to be judged by the Number of Sheets they have written I have very little Pretence to Favour But as  Multum in Parvo  is an Expression of an ancient Poet I hope my Readers will excuse me as I would rather have them rise from Table with an Appetite than glut them a Rule of Temperance equally conducive to the Health of our Minds as of our Bodies  I once had the Misfortune of wri∣ting for a Printer who never exa∣mined the Merit of the Work but used to measure it and tell me it would not do at all except I could send him half a Dozen Yards more of the same Stuff And as Dr  Young  remarks on large Folios well gilt and bound  very proper to adorn a Library whe∣ther the Owner of it can read or write or not  So  Tonson  turn'd Upholsterer sends home  The gilded Leather to adorn the Room  If I am obliged to send my Work in a blue Paper Covering let them look on the Inside which I flatter myself will at least amuse them  As I wrote these Memoirs in  Eng∣land  the describing particular Places or Customs peculiar to  Ireland  in order to make the Work intelligible to the  English  Readers will I hope be excused for all Countries vary from each other in many Points  So neither servilely fearing Cen∣sure nor vainly hoping Applause I refer my Readers to the ensuing Pages  MEMOIRS OF Mrs  PILKINGTON  ALTHO' it has been the com∣mon Practice with Writers of Memoirs to fill their Volumes with their own Praises which whatever Pleasure they may have afforded to the Authors by indulging their Vanity are seldom found to give any to the Readers I am determined to quit this beaten Track and by a strict Adherence to Truth please even my greatest Enemies by presenting them with a lively Picture of all my  Faults  my  Follies  and the  Misfortunes  which have been consequential to them  And I am the more inclined to proceed in that I think the Story may be instruc∣tive to the  Female  Part of my Readers to teach them that  Reputation  Is the immediate Jewel of their Souls  And that the Loss of it  Will make them poor indeed  Othello  So that I propose myself not as an Ex∣ample but a Warning to them that by my Fall they may stand the more secure  However numerous my Mistakes in Life have been they have still had most surprizing Additions made to them not only by base and unworthy Minds Wretches devoid of Truth and common Honesty but also by Persons of high Rank and such as outwardly profess Christianity who have fancied it an Act of Piety to be∣lieve and spread of me the most impro∣bable and notorious Falshoods nay so far has their persecuting Zeal been carried that they have rendered my honest Industry in∣effectual  and by depriving me of any Means to support Life endeavoured to make me even such a one as they repre∣sented me to be That Clergymen and Ladies of Honour should unite in driving to Extremity a Person who never yet either in her Conversation or Writing of∣fended against the Laws of Decency or Hu∣manity is but too apt to make one think they had quite forgotten the Christian Grace  Charity  without which we are told all other Virtues are of no Avail and con∣sequently fall far short of Perfection them∣selves  I therefore hope those who have taken such unbounded Liberties with my Charac∣ter will also allow me to paint out theirs only with this Difference that I shall con∣fine myself to Truth a Favour I never yet received at their Hands since even the priestly Robe and Mitred Head have with Regard to me disclaimed it of which in the Series of these melancholy Adven∣tures I shall be able to produce many sur∣prizing Instances  I was born in the Year by my Mother's Side descended of an antient and honourable Family who were frequent∣ly intermarried with the Nobility My Great Grandfather was Earl of  Killmallock  whose Daughter married Colonel  Meade  by whom he had twentyone Children twelve of whom lived to be married This Gentleman to his Honour be it spoken tho' he was a Man of Fortune and in the Army declared on his Deathbed  'That he never had either when a Batche∣lor or a married Man criminal Conver∣sation with a Woman never was drunk never broke his Word nor ever used Tobacco'  The late Duke of  Ormond  when Lord Lieutenant of  Ireland  dining at Colonel  Meade  's offered to confer on him the Ho∣nour of Knighthood but he then being in an advanced Age declined it for himself telling his Grace  'As he was going out of the World and his eldest Son coming into it he would chuse if he thought pro∣per his Grace should bestow it on him'  Which accordingly he did  This Gentleman Sir  John Meade  was bred to the Law and deservedly distin∣guished as one of the finest Orators that ever spoke at the Bar He was a perfect Master of classical Learning and a Lover and Judge of the muselike Arts his pa∣ternal Estate was about Fifteen Hundred Pounds a Year which was augmented by marrying successively two great Heiresses as well as by the vast Business he had in his Profession So that with all those Advan∣tages of Nature Education and Fortune it was no Wonder he should meet with universal Respect and Esteem  He was in this Situation when Sir  Ed∣ward Seymor  had an Estate of five Thousand Pounds a Year left to him in  Ireland  this was a Matter too considerable for Sir  Ed∣ward  to hope immediately to possess with∣out Lawsuit or Difficulty so that he found his personal Appearance absolutely necessary It is to be observed that Sir  Edward Seymor  was accounted the proudest Man in  England  and Sir  John Meade  was as remarkable for the same Fault neither indeed did I ever meet with any Person of  either of those Names in  England  or  Ire∣land  who was not abundantly stocked with it tho' without the same Pretensions to support it  Sir  Edward Seymor  landed at  Dublin  filled with that natural Contempt for the whole Country which those of the  English  who have not been resident amongst them are but too apt to express on every Occa∣sion He there found some of his own Countrymen in Places of Profit and Trust of whom he enquired  'Whether there are any such Things as good Lawyers to be met with in this damned Place'  They answered  'Yes very good but if he hoped to carry his Cause he must see Sir  John Meade  Well said he let one of my Footmen go for him'  'Your Footman Sir  Edward  said one of the Gentlemen who knew Sir  John  Why 'tis odds if he will speak to You I assure you if he does 'tis a Favour few of his Clients obtain from him'  'What  a Duce  return'd he do  Irish  Lawyers take such State upon them'  'You are to consider Sir  Edward  he is a Gentle∣man  of Family has a noble Fortune and is so eminent in his Profession that should he be employed against you you may bid Farewel to your Claim'  This last Argument had such Force with Sir  Edward Seymor  that he condescended to wait on Sir  John Meade  next Morning Sir  John  had been apprized of what the other had said and resolving to be as state∣ly as himself sent him down Word  'He was very busy but if he pleased to wait till he was at Leisure he would see him'  So Sir  Edward  was shewn into a Parlour where he remained above an Hour fretting himself to Death at this disrespectful Usage offered to a Person of his Dignity  When Sir  John  thought he had pretty sufficiently mortified him he sent to let him know he should be glad to see him and received him with a Politeness natural to him but when Sir  Edward  went to open his Case to him he told him  'He must leave him his Brief for he could not spare Time to hear him'  So Sir  Edward  laid down his Brief with a large Purse of Gold on it and having got his Audience  of Leave departed full of Indignation at meeting with a Man as proud as himself  When the Day appointed for the impor∣tant Trial was come there were Numbers of Lawyers engaged on either Side of the Question Sir  John  being I suppose re∣solved to try his Client's Patience to the uttermost permitted every one of them to speak before him without Interruption and sat drawing Birds with a Pencil till Sir  Edward  was ready to burst with Rage at him especially as he found the Cause likely to go against him At length when their Pleadings were ended and Judgment going to be pronounced against Sir  Edward  Sir  John Meade  arose and desired to be heard which he ever was with Favour and Attention by the Court when making a Speech which took an Hour and a half in Time he so fully confuted all Sir  Ed∣ward  's Antagonists and made his Title to the Estate so evident and with such power∣ful Eloquence that he had a Decree to be put in immediate Possession  Sir  Edward  was so charmed with Sir  John  's graceful Elocution that he could  not forbear several Times crying out in Extacy  An Angel by Heaven an Angel  But when he found the happy Effects of it so much to his own Advantage he could no longer contain himself but cathing Sir  John  in his Arms  My dear dear Friend  says he permit me to have the Honour of calling you so I do not wonder you should be proud who have more Cause to be so than any Man living  The Court not breaking up till it was late Sir  Edward  pressed Sir  John  to give him his Company that Evening Sir  John  excused himself telling him  'He was every Night engaged to a Club'  'Well then said Sir  Edward  if you will give me Leave I will accompany you pro∣vided you think it will be agreeable to your Friends'  Sir  John  answered  'They would all he was sure esteem it as a very great Honour'  So according∣ly Sir  Edward  met them and they were mutually delighted with each other's Con∣versation we may presume by their stay∣ing together till Four the next Morning Some of Sir  Edward  's Friends finding him  in Bed at Twelve o'Clock the ensuing Day he told them  'He had sat up all Night'  'With whom Sir  Edward  '  Why returned he  'With  Homer Plato Socrates Cicero  and all the antient  Greek  and  Roman  Poets Philosophers and His∣torians'  From this Time Sir  Edward  and Sir  John  contracted a Friendship which did not terminate but with their Lives  As this little Piece of History redounds to the mutual Honour of both these great and eminent Gentlemen I hope it will not be accounted Vanity in me to recite it  One of Sir  John Meade  's Sisters being smitten with the good Mien of a  Roman  Catholick Officer in King  James  's Army stole a Match with him of which my Mo∣ther was the Firstfruits but her Mother dying in Childbed of her second Child and King  William  entirely subduing  Ire∣land  my Grandfather thought proper to follow his Royal Master's Fortune to  France  leaving my Mother then an In∣fant to the wide World However Pro∣vidence did not abandon the helpless Or∣phan  her Grandmother the Widow of Colonel  Meade  beforementioned took her Home to her and while she lived with true maternal Tenderness bestowed on her the best and politest Education And when the Trustees sat in  Ireland  it being proved she was bred a Protestant she recovered her Mother's Fortune which had been settled on her and which she had been some Years kept out of on Account of her Father's being a forfeiting Person  He in the mean time returned privately to  England  and married a Niece of the celebrated Jesuit Father  Hugh Peters  by this second Venture he had one Daughter who was married to Mr  Fowler  of St  Thomas  in  Staffordshire  the sole Heiress of whom is the present Lady  Faulconbridge  to whom were it of any Use to me I have the Honour of being a first Cousin by the HalfBlood  My Mother being now in Possession of a handsome Fortune and by the Death of her Grandmother entirely at her own Dis∣posal for her Fathern ever enquired what became of her did not it may be sup∣posed  want Admirers especially as she had a very graceful Person with Abun∣dance of Wit which was improved by reading and keeping the best Company however none of them made any Impression on her Heart till she saw my Father who was the Son of a  Dutch  Physician that ac∣cidentally settled in  Ireland  and who had no other Fortune to boast of than a liberal Education and a very amiable Person and Understanding Qualities which recom∣mended him to my Mother so powerfully that she had Constancy enough to wait for him three Years while he went to  Leyden  where he studied Physick under the late fa∣mous Dr  Boerhaave  and having taken his Degree he returned to  Ireland  uniting him∣self in Marriage to his faithful Mistress Her Friends were at first much displeased with her but my Father's Merit soon re∣conciled them to her Choice and there being then but one ManMidwife in the Kingdom my Father made himself Master of that useful Art and practised it with great Success Reputation and Huma∣nity  I was their second Child and my eldest Brother dying an Infant for a long Time their only one being of a tender weakly Constitution I was by my Father greatly indulged indeed I cannot say but it was in some Measure necessary he should by his Gentleness qualify my Mother's Severity to me otherwise it must have broke my Heart for she strictly followed  Solomon  's Advice in never sparing the Rod inso∣much that I have frequently been whipt for looking blue of a frosty Morning and whether I deserved it or not I was sure of Correction every Day of my Life  From my earliest Infancy I had a strong Disposition to Letters but my Eyes being weak after the Smallpox I was not permitted to look at a Book my Mother regarding more the Beauty of my Face than the Improvement of my Mind nei∣ther was I allowed to learn to read This Restraint as it generally happens made me but more earnest in the Pursuit of what I imagined must be so delightful Twenty times a Day have I been corrected for ask∣ing what such and such Letters spelt my  Mother used to tell me the Word accom∣panying it with a good Box on the Ear which I suppose imprinted it on my Mind Had  Gulliver  seen her Behaviour I should have imagined he had borrowed a Hint from it for his floating Island where when a great Man had promised any Favour the Suppliant was obliged to give him a Tweak by the Nose or a Kick on the Rump to quicken his Memory However I do assure you it had this Ef∣fect on me insomuch that I never forgot what was once told me and quickly arrived at my desired Happiness being able to read before she thought I knew all my Letters but this Pleasure I was obliged to enjoy by Stealth with Fear and Trembling  I was at this Time about five Years of Age and my Mother being one Day a∣broad I had happily laid hold on  Alexan∣der's Feast  and found something in it so charming that I read it aloudbut how like a condemned Criminal did I look when my Father softly opening his Study∣door took me in the very Fact I dropt my Book and burst into Tears begging  Pardon and promising never to do so a∣gain But my Sorrow was soon dispelled when he bade me not be frightened but read to him which to his great Surprize I did very distinctly and without hurting the Beauty of the Numbers Instead of the whipping of which I stood in dread he took me up in his Arms and kissed me giving me a whole Shilling as a Re∣ward and told me  'He would give me another as soon as I got a Poem by Heart'  which he put into my Hand and proved to be Mr  Pope  's sacred Ec∣logue which Task I performed before my Mother returned Home They were both astonished at my Memory and from that Day forward I was permitted to read as much as I pleased only my Father took care to furnish me with the best and poli∣test Authors and took Delight in explain∣ing to me whatever by Reason of my tender Years was above my Capacity of Understanding  But chiefly was I charmed and ravished with the Sweets of Poetry all my Hours were dedicated to the Muses and from a  Reader I quickly became a Writer I may truly say with Mr  Pope  I lisp'd in Numbers for the Numbers came  My Performances had the good Fortune to be looked on as extraordinary for my Years and the greatest and wisest Men in the Kingdom did not disdain to hear the Prattle of the little Muse as they called me even in my childish Days But as I ap∣proached towards Womanhood there was a new Scene opened to me and by the Time I had looked on thirteen Years I had almost as many Lovers not that I ever was handsome farther than being very fair But I was welldrest sprightly and remarkably welltempered unapt to give or take Offence insomuch that my Com∣pany was generally coveted and no doubt but I should have been happily disposed of in Marriage but that my Mother's capri∣cious Temper made her reject every advan∣tageous Proposal offered and at last con∣demn me to the Arms of one of the great∣est Vs with Reverence to the Priest∣hood  be it spoken that ever was wrapt up in Crape  And here I cannot forbear observing how very few who wear that Sd Ht are adorned with any real Sanctity of Man∣ners What Ambition Avarice Lust and Cruelty reigns among them they are ge∣nerally the first Seducers of Innocence as the Holiness of their Office gives them free Admittance into every Family and as soon as they have made a Breach in the tender Mind for Ruin's wasteful Entrance pro∣vided they can but slip their own Necks out of the Halter and remain unexposed they shall be the first to persecute with Ec∣clesiastical Courts and Spiritual Authori∣ty that very Person whom they them∣selves first taught the Way to sin  Let none presume to censure this as Spite  I suffer for their Crimes of whom I write  And 'tis ever allowed that the Losers may have leave to speak  I would not by this Reflection be thought to strike at Religion or the valuable Part  of the Clergy Those who are possessed of Christian Charity and make the Sincerity of their Faith appear in the Righteousness of their Life are truly worthy of Reve∣rence and Honour but alas their Num∣ber is so few that the Ears of Corn are scarce discernable among the Tares of whom no doubt Satan will reap a plen∣tiful Harvest  But to return Amongst all those who addrest me my Heart retained its Freedom and if their Flattery pleased me it was only as it fed my Vanity that Passion which like Pride is so universal I had no parti∣cular Engagement was entirely submissive to my Parents punctual to all the Duties of Religion unaffectedly innocent and much more pleased with my Female Friends than with the Company of Men  There were two young Ladies in parti∣cular for whom from my Childhood I had a very tender Affection and whom as often as I could I visited as their Brother was a Clergyman many of the Gown fre∣quented their House and amongst the rest the Reader of our ParishChurch Mr  Pn  He had a good Face and many agreeable Accomplishments as a tolerable Taste in Music and a poetical Turn which greatly entertained me but being a Man of obscure Birth and low Fortune I had no farther Thoughts of him than merely as an Acquaintance However it was my Misfortune to be liked by him when I least imagined it as he played very well on the Organ he gave us an Invitation to Church promising after EveningPrayer to sing an Anthem for us I who always delighted in ChurchMusic begged my Mother's Per∣mission to go which with some Difficulty I obtained After the Music he invited us into the VestryRoom where he had prepa∣red a little Collation of Fruit Wine  c  and singling me out he began to address me in a very passionate Stile and earnestly beg∣ged Leave to visit me I told him  'I was to go into the Country next Day to stay all the Summer and were I not I had no Male Visitants but such as my Parents approved of and consequently it was out of my Power to grant his Request'  My Mother sending for me prevented any far∣ther  Conversation for that Time and ear∣ly the next Morning we set out on our in∣tended Journey  During my Stay in the Country he wrote me a great many poetical Compli∣ments and subscribed himself  Amintas  As they were really very elegant my Mo∣ther who always examined my Letters exprest great Curiosity to know the Wri∣ter saying  'I ought to return a Letter of Thanks to him'  But as I took this only for a Trap I told her which was true I knew not who it was lest I should be denied the Pleasure of visiting the young Ladies where I first saw him if I should have given her the smallest Hint that I guessed at the Person  I had by this Time a Brother of about nine Years of Age of whom my Father and Mother were fond even to Extrava∣gance whenever I went abroad he used to cry to go with me and was constantly indulged in it  A few Days after our Return to Town I went to wait on the young Ladies before∣mentioned and took my Brother with me  I was scarce seated when Mr  Pn  came in and after saluting me began to re∣proach me with Cruelty in never having favoured him with an Answer to any of his Letters I told him  'I was much obliged to him for the agreeable Entertainment they had afforded me but that except∣ing my Father I had never wrote to any Man neither was I Mistress of Wit e∣nough to correspond with him'  A good many civil Things were said on either Hand during Tea Time after which my Brother growing urgent with me to return Home I happened to say he was so great a Favourite I durst not contradict him upon which Mr  Pn  made his Appli∣cation to him and gave him an Invitation to his Lodgings where he entertained him so kindly that the Child returned in Rap∣tures with him and loaden with Toys and Sweetmeats Upon this Civility to my Brother my Father sent and invited Mr  Pn  to Dinner and you may be sure he did not refuse him but quickly found the Art of making himself so agreeable to my Parents that they were even uneasy  whenever he was absent which seldom happened except when his Duty required his Attendance He now began openly to court me and to my great Surprize nei∣ther of them feemod averse to it but al∣lowed him as much Liberty of conversing with me as a reasonable Man could desire and for my own Part he gained so large a Share in my Esteem that as they seemed to approve of him I was very well satis∣fied  One Year past on in this Manner during which Time Mr  Pn  never omitted any Thing to convince me of the Sincerity of his Passion and tho' he saw me every Day and all the Day yet every Day was still but as the first  So eager was he still to see me more  The ensuing Spring my Mother took a Lodging about a Mile from  Dublin  by the Seaside for the Benefit of bathing where my Father and Mr  Pn  came every Afternoon together to visit us but my Father's Business seldom permitting  him to stay above half an Hour he gene∣rally left Mr  Pn  with us Who one Night happening to stay later than ordina∣ry left a Gold Watch and a handsome Diamond Ring in my Possession lest as he said he should be robbed of them going Home My Father and he coming to us the next Day according to Custom I brought to Mr  Pn  his Ring and Watch but he would by no Means ac∣cept of either but insisted on my keeping them as a Present my Father and Mother were both by and neither of them shew∣ing any Dislike to it I was with great Reluctance obliged by him to take them  I mention these Particulars trifling as they are because I have been accused of Disobedience to my Parents in marrying without their Consent or Knowledge whereas they were acquainted with the Af∣fair from Beginning to End neither was I any more than passive in it never hav∣ing allowed myself to have any Will but theirs  My Father was at this Time so eminent in his Profession and lived after so elegant  a manner that every body concluded he was able to give me a very good Fortune and few People could believe he counte∣nanced Mr  Pn  's Addresses to me he neither having any Preferment in the Church nor any other Fortune And what∣ever Merit an  Irish  Clergyman may possess he has little Hope of Advancement by it unless he has some Relation in the House of Commons who by betraying the Inte∣rest of his Country can procure for him  The Leavings of a Church distrest  A hungry Vicarage at best  Or some remote inferior Post  With forty Pounds a Year at most  Swift  And in this the present State of poor  Ire∣land  nearly resembles that of  England  un∣der the Reign of Queen  Mary  when as soon as a Bishoprick became vacant an  Ita∣lian  was immediately nominated to it  Ireland  groans under the same Calamity An  English  Vy  English  Judges  Eng∣lish  Bishops with their long Train of Re∣lations and Dependants lay their hard  Hands on all Preferments while her learn∣ed Sons languish out Life in hopeless Po∣verty and Dejection of Spirit  I have frequently observed it as a Want of Policy in the  English  Government to permit the People of  Ireland  to have an U∣niversity Learning naturally inspires Men with the Love of Liberty the Principles of which ought to be discouraged in the Minds of those whom their Masters are pleased to condemn to Slavery Want and Oppression unless perhaps it may be done with a cruel Intent of making their Yoke the more galling to them  Ireland  while free was remarkable for producing brave and valiant Men Ever witness for her  Her matchless Sons whose Valour still remains  On  French  Records for twenty long Cam∣paigns  Yet from an Empress now a Captive grown  She sav'd  Britannia  's Right and lost her own  Swift  I hope I shall be pardoned by all true Patriots for this Digression if not I can only make Use of  Falstaff  's Apology  That Rebellion lay in my Way and I found it  But to resume my Thread All my Friends and Relations attacked my Father warmly on this Head who solemnly de∣clared  'He knew nothing of any amorous Correspondence between Mr  Pn  and his Daughter that the Gentleman came to visit us as being Parishioners'  But withal declared  'Since such a Report was spread he would civilly forbid him the House'  which accordingly he or∣dered my Mother to do Mr  Pn  came as usual and my Mother delivered her dreadful Commission to him No sooner was the fatal Sentence pronounced but my astonished Lover fell pale and speechless to the Floor and to say the Truth my Case was little better than his I raised him in my Arms and senseless as he seemed he grasped me close and leaned his drooping Head upon my Bosom whilst my Mother applied Remedies to  him till he revived When he came to himself he blamed us for our Care say∣ing  'Since I was lost he could not would not live'  As I was naturally of a soft compas∣sionate Temper the Condition I saw him in pierced my very Soul but I was too much in Awe of my Mother to venture to say so at that Time So he left me with Sorrow deeply imprinted in his Counte∣nance and as I believed in his Heart  About two Years before this a young Woman of about eighteen Years of Age was brought to my Father by a Stationer to be by him instructed in Midwifery She was Mistress of  Hebrew Greek Latin  and  French  understood the  Mathematicks  as well as most Men And what made these extraordinary Talents yet more surprizing was that her Parents were poor illiterate Country People so that her Learning ap∣peared like the Gift poured out on the A∣postles of speaking all Languages with∣out the Pains of Study or like the intui∣tive Knowledge of Angels Yet in as much as the Power of Miracles is ceased we  must allow she used human Means for such great and excellent Acquirements And yet in a long Friendship and Famili∣arity with her I could never obtain a satis∣factory Account from her on this Head only she said  'she had received some little Instruction from the Minister of the Pa∣rish when she could spare Time from her Needlework to which she was closely kept by her Mother'  She wrote elegant∣ly both in Verse and Prose and some of the most delightful Hours I ever past were in the Conversation of this female Philosopher  My Father readily consented to accept of her as a Pupil and gave her a general Invitation to his Table so that she and I were seldom asunder My Parents were well pleased with our Intimacy as her Piety was not inferior to her Learning Whe∣ther it was owing to her own Desire or the Envy of those who survived her I know not but of her various and beautiful Wri∣tings except one Poem of her's in Mrs  Barber  's Works I have never seen any published 'tis true as her Turn was chief∣ly  to philosophical or divine Subjects they might not be agreeable to the present Taste yet could her heavenly Muse de∣scend from its sublime Height to the easy epistolary Stile and suit itself to my then gay Disposition as may appear by the two following Poems To make them intelli∣gible my Reader must observe that I being in a Country Town at the Assizes Time had writ her an Account to  Dublin  of the principal Entertainments I met with there and in the rest of the Country I must also beg Pardon for publishing the Compliments paid to me in them which I really would omit were it possible Her Answer to my first Letter was this  To Miss  LAETITIA VAN LEWEN  THE fleeting Birds may soon in O∣cean swim  And  Northern  Whales thro' liquid Azure skim  The  Dublin  Ladies their Intrigues forsake  To Dress and Scandal an Aversion take  When you can in the lonely Forest walk  And with some serious Matron gravely talk  Of Possets Poultices and Waters still'd  And monstrous Casks with Mead and Cyder fill'd  How many Hives of Bees she has in Store  And how much Fruit her Trees this  Sum∣mer  bore  Or Home returning in the Yard can stand  And feed the Chickens from your boun∣teous Hand  Of each one's Topknot tell and hatching pry  Like  Tully  waiting for an Augury  When Night approaches down to Table sit  With a great Crowd choice Meat and little Wit  What Horse won the last Race how migh∣ty  Tray  At the last famous Hunting caught the Prey  Surely you can't but such Discourse des∣pise  Methinks I see Displeasure in your Eyes  O my  Laetitia  stay no longer there  You'll soon forget that you yourself are fair  Why will you keep from us from all that's gay  There in a lonely Solitude to stay  Where not a Mortal thro' the Year you view  But bobwigg'd Hunters who their Game pursue  With so much Ardor they'd a Cock or Hare  To thee in all thy blooming Charms prefer  You write of Belles and Beaux that there appear  And gilded Coaches such as glitter here  For gilded Coaches each estated Clown  That gravely slumbers on the Bench has one  But Beaux they're young Attorneys sure you mean  Who thus appear to your romantic Brain  Alas no Mortal there can talk to you  That Love or Wit or Softness ever knew  All they can speak of's  Capias  and Law  And Writs to keep the Country Fools in Awe  And if to Wit or Courtship they pretend  'Tis the same Way that they a Cause de∣fend  In which they give of Lungs a vast Ex∣pence  But little Passion Thought or Eloquence  Bad as they are they'll soon abandon you  And Gain and Clamour in the Town pursue  So haste to Town if ev'n such Fools you prize  O haste to Town and bless the longing Eyes  Of your CONSTANTIA  The Second was as follows  IF my  Laetitia  still persists to love  The Country Village and the shady Grove  The murm'ring Riv'let and the Turtles Moan  Despising all the Grandeur of a Town  Where Beauty triumphs and where Plea∣sure reigns  And Rounds of Mirth relieve our daily Pains  Where  George  's mighty Substitute appears  And every Face with blooming Pleasure chears  Grafton  whom never fair one saw un∣mov'd  Whom ev'n great  Churchill  's beauteous Offspring lov'd  For him whate'er o'er all our Kingdom's fine  They in this happy Place together join  With him each warlike glittering Soldier goes  With him the tender Race of whining Beaux  In short we've here all that may hope t'engage  One of your Wit your Beauty and your Age  If all these pow'rful Arguments shou'd fail  I'll in the tenderest Part your Heart assail  The lovely  Damon  languishes and dies  Nor can revive but by your charming Eyes  But I forgotMamma these Lines must see  So you shall hear no more of him from me  As this Lady was perfectly well ac∣quainted with Mr  Pn  's Regard for me he applied to her to intreat a Meeting at her Lodgings where I frequently went  She had too much Compassion for a des∣pairing honourable Lover to refuse his Re∣quest and accordingly she gave him No∣tice the next Visit that I made to her after having asked my Consent to it Our In∣terview was very melancholy and his Sighs and Tears prevailed so much on my young soft Heart that at last I faithfully pro∣mised to be his but added  'We were both so young that it would be prudent to wait till he had some Preferment or till my Parents came into better Tem∣per and that in the mean time I would see him or write to him as often as I conveniently could'  I forgot to mention that I had sent him his Watch and Ring some Days before he would fain have prevailed on me to take them again but I absolutely refused them  The next Morning my Father told me I must prepare to go and stay a Year with my Grandfather who lived a hundred Miles  distant from  Dublin  and that I must set out in two Days I made no Answer but thought proper to give Mr  Pn  No∣tice of my Departure and easily prevailed on my Brother to give him a Letter but Heav'ns how was I frighted when he re∣turning in a few Moments told me Mr  Pn  had stabbed himself with his Penknife I ran all in Tears to my Mo∣ther entreating her Permission to go and see him She appeared much concerned and sent for him to come to us which pleas∣ing Summons he readily obeyed But I could scarce forbear laughing at my own Credulity when my wounded Swain came to us in perfect Health He had indeed given himself a Scratch on Purpose to ter∣rify us and had just such a desperate Wound as I have frequently received from the Point of a Pin without complaining  However by this Artifice he once more gained Admission to us and had an Op∣portunity of assuring my Mother  'That if she sent me to the  WestIndies  he would follow me'  and added also  'That he was next Heir to a good Estate'  which was the most prevailing Argument he could make use of to her and took such an Effect that she not only kept him to Supper but so far indulged him as to give him a Key to the Garden which o∣pened into a little Stable Lane by which means he could come in and go out as often as he pleased unnoticed As soon as he left us my Mother spoke to me in this Manner  'Child said she I believe that young Man loves you sincerely neither have your Father or I any Objection to him but in the Light we appear in to the World it would seem strange to ac∣cept of him as a Sonin law Your Fa∣ther is not at present able to give you a Fortune and I know most of those who address you hope for one with you and he chuses rather to reject them than let them into his real Circumstances What I would therefore advise you to is this If you love this Man marry him we shall at first seem displeased and then forgive it and do for you every thing within our Power as he is an ingenious sober Man your Father's Interest may  soon get him a Living and till then ye shall both live with us'  This Discourse strangely surprized me and left me doubtful how to act to take to myself the Reproach of Disobedience in the Eyes of the World appeared very shocking to me and tho' I was resolved to marry Mr  Pn  some Time or o∣ther yet I was startled at the Thought of doing it immediately and told my Mo∣ther my Objections However they ap∣peared but trifling to her The next Morning she called me pretty early to Breakfast and to my great Surprize I found Mr  Pn  with my Father his Harpsichord placed in the Parlour which with a Cat and an Owl were all his world∣ly Goods  He told me with great Rapture that he was going for a Ring and a Licence to be married in the Evening As for my Part I thought he only jested till my Father confirmed it by telling me I must either resolve to marry immediately or break off with Mr  Pn  entirely leaving it to my Choice which to do I was too  much confounded to make any other Return than to give my Hand to Mr  Pn  who kissed it with great Extacy and my unfortunate Nuptials being thus concluded we were married privately in the Evening by the VicarGeneral having no other Wit∣nesses but my Father and Mother and his Father and we resolved to keep it secret for a few Days to avoid the Hurry and Expence of Matrimony We went into the Country to my Uncle Brigadier  Meade  's Seat for a Fortnight where my new es∣poused Husband staying from me a whole Day in Pursuit of his Game for he de∣lighted in Fowling at his Return I pre∣sented him with the following Lines my first Attempt in Poetry that was not quite childish  The Petition of the BIRDS  AH Shepherd gentle Shepherd spare  Us plum'd Inhabitants of Air  That hop and inoffensive rove  From Tree to Tree from Grove to Grove  What Phrenzy has possest your Mind  To be destructive of your Kind  Admire not if we Kindred claim  Our sep'rate Natures are the same  To each of us thou ow'st a Part  To grace thy Person Head or Heart  The chaste the fond the tender  Dove  Inspires thy Breast with purest Love  The tow'ring  Eagle  claims a Part  In thy courageous gen'rous Heart  On thee the  Finch  bestow'd a Voice  To bid the raptured Soul rejoice  The  Hawk  has giv'n thee Eyes so bright  They kindle Love and soft Delight  Thy snowy Hue and graceful Mien  May in the stately  Swan  be seen  The  Robin  's Plumes afford the Red  Which thy soft Lips and Cheeks bespread  Thy filial Piety and Truth  The  Stork  bestow'd to crown thy Youth  Did we these sev'ral Gifts bestow  To give Perfection to a Foe  Did we so many Virtues give  To thee too fierce to let us live  Suspend your Rage and every Grove  Shall echo Songs of grateful Love  Let Pity sooth and sway your Mind  And be the Phoenix of Mankind  This little poetical Essay met with more Applause than it really merited on Account of my Youth and was extremely acceptable to Mr  Pn  who with the Raptures of an enamoured Bridegroom read it to every Person whom he thought possessed of Taste or Genius  On our Return to Town we received the Visits and Compliments of all our Ac∣quaintance every one of whom my Mo∣ther assured I had married without their Consent but this was not all for she said it so often that at length she persuaded her∣self it was so and made it a Pretence for giving me all imaginable ill Treatment both in publick and private which having no Remedy I was obliged to bear as pa∣tiently as I could for if I quitted her House I had no Place to go to as Mr  Pn  's whole Income would scarce have paid the Rent of a tolerable ready furnished Lodging However I had some Consola∣tion in Mr  Pn  's Tenderness which  seemed daily to increase for me and in the Conversation of a very agreeable Set of Friends some of whom it may not be a∣miss to give a particular Description of  In the first Place I had the Honour of being well received by Mrs  Percival  who is married to the Brother of the Earl of  Egmont  to whose Virtues I cannot refuse doing Justice altho' her Censures of me have not been overcharitable a Lady of most universal Genius there being no one Accomplishment that adorns the Woman of Quality but what she possessed and her Sta∣tion gave her an Opportunity of shewing them to Advantage she was also extreme∣ly happy in her Family her Husband was a most worthy Gentleman both her Sons Men of Sense and Honour and one of her Daughters very agreeable It may easily be supposed this Belle Assembly engaged the Company of all the learned and polite World every Night was a DrawingRoom and the ingenious and curious of both Sexes went Home delighted and im∣proved As my Father was Physician to Mrs  Percival  and her eldest Son married  to a near Relation of mine I had at all Times free Access and so found a frequent pleasing Relief from my Vexations  I had also the much envied Honour of being known to Dr  Swift  whose Ge∣nius excellent as it was surpassed not his Humanity in the most judicious and useful Charities altho' often hid under a rough Appearance till he was perfectly convinced both of the Honesty and Distress of those he bestowed it on He was a perpetual Friend to Merit and Learning and utter∣ly incapable of Envy Indeed why should he not who in true genuine Wit could fear no Rival  Yet as I have frequently observed in Life that where great Talents are bestowed there the strongest Passions are likewise given This truly great Man did but too often let them have Dominion over him and that on the most trifling Occasions During Mealtimes he was evermore in a Storm the Meat was always too much or too little done or the Servants had offended in some Point imperceptible to the rest of the Company however when the Cloth  was taken away he made his Guests rich Amends for the Pain he had given them by the former Part of his Behaviour For  Then was truly mingled in the friendly Bowl  The Feast of Reason and the Flow of Soul  Pope  Yet strict Temperance preserved for the Doctor never drank above half a Pint of Wine in every Glass of which he mixed Water and Sugar yet if he liked his Company would sit many Hours over it unlocking all the Springs of Policy Learn∣ing true Humour and inimitable Wit  It is a very great Loss to the World that this admirable Gentleman never could be prevailed on to give us the Particulars of his own Life because as it is the Fate of all eminent Persons to have various Cha∣racters given of them so it was more re∣markably his One Reason for this may justly be assigned that as at his first setting out Party ran high those who on either Side had any Talents for Writing spared not to throw the blackest Aspersions on the  other so that if we give them both Cre∣dit we must conclude there was neither Honour nor Virtue among them but that all who were out  Tories  and  Whigs Whigs  and  Tories  were equally corrupt Indeed Ambition is a grand Deceiver and apt to undermine Integrity itself and this the Doctor himself was so sensible of that I have frequently heard him declare  'He thought it a great Blessing that all his Hopes of Preferment were at once cut off insomuch that he had nothing to tempt or mislead him from a Patriotism in which his grateful Country found their Happiness and Security'  This leads me to a Story I remember to have heard him tell and therefore I hope cannot be impertinent  A Clergyman whose Character greatly resembled that I have heard Bishop  Berkley  give to Bishop  Atterbury  namely a most learned fine Gentleman who under the soft∣est and politest Appearance concealed the most turbulent Ambition This Clergy∣man having made his Merit as a Preacher too eminent to be overlooked had it early  rewarded with a Mitre his Friend Dr  Swift  went to congratulate him on it but at the same Time told him  'He hoped as his Lordship was a Native of  Ireland  and had now a Seat in the House of Peers he would employ his powerful Elocution in the Service of his distressed Country'  The Prelate told him  'The Bishoprick was but a very small one and he could not hope for a better if he did not oblige the Court'  'Very well says  Swift  then it is to be hoped when you have a better you will become an honest Man'  'Ay that I will Mr Dean says he till then my Lord farewel'  This pious Prelate was twice translated to richer Sees and on every Translation Dr  Swift  waited on him to remind him of his Promise but to no Purpose there was now an Archbishoprick in View and till that was obtained nothing could be done This in a short Time he likewise possessed he then sent for the Dean and told him  'I am now at the Top of my Pre∣ferment for I well know no  Irishman  will ever be made Primate therefore as  I can rise no higher in Fortune or Sta∣tion I will zealously promote the good of my Country'  A fine Reason truly And so he commenced a most outrageous Patriot from those very laudable Motives and continued so till his Death which hap∣pened within these few Years  I hope my Readers will indulge me in the frequent Mention I shall make of Dr  Swift  for tho' his Works are univer∣sally esteemed yet few Persons now living have had so many Opportunities of seeing him in private Life as my being a Person  sans  Consequence afforded me which Hap∣piness I obtained by the following Means  The learned Nymph beforementioned whom Curiosity engaged every Person to see had shewn many of my Scribbles to Dr  Delany  known sufficiently by his own incomparable Life and Writings As she was one of the first to congratulate me on my Marriage she was a Witness how severely both Mr  Pn  and I were used or rather abused by my Mother she told Dr  Delany  of it and made such fa∣vourable mention of the poor young Couple  that he generously imagined his countenan∣cing Mr  Pn  might be a Means of pro∣curing us better Treatment He had been Classfellow with my Father in the Col∣lege and tho' they did not visit yet they had that mutual Esteem for each other which good Men feel for good Men and were pleased whenever Accident threw them into each other's Company The Doctor preaching at our Parish Church immedi∣ately after our Marriage was so kind as to join us coming out and accompany us Home to wish the young Couple Joy a Favour we were all extremely proud of at parting he gave us all an Invitation to to dine at his beautiful Villa about a small Mile distant from  Dublin  what Opinion I conceived of him and his Improvements may be seen in the following Lines com∣posed in one of his lovely Arbours  Delville  the Seat of the Rev Dr  DELANY  HAIL happy  Delville  blissful Seat  The Muse's best belov'd Retreat  With Prospects large and unconfin'd  Blest Emblem of their Master's Mind  Where fragrant Gardens painted Meads  Wide op'ning Walks and twilight Shades  Inspiring Scenes elate the Heart  Nature improv'd and rais'd by Art  So Paradise delightful smil'd  Blooming and beautifully wild  Thrice happy Sage who safe retir'd  By Heav'n and by the Muse inspir'd  In polish'd Arts or Lays sublime  Or Godlike Acts employ your Time  Here Nature's Beauties you explore  And searching her mysterious Store  Thro' all her Operations find  The Image of the Sov'reign Mind  And in each Insect Plant and Flow'r  Contemplate the creating Pow'r  Nor is thy Love of him alone  In fruitless Speculation shewn  Thro' Life you happily exert  The Christian Virtues of your Heart  To give new Schemes of Culture Birth  And bless and beautify the Earth  To raise th' Afflicted from Despair  And make the friendless Wretch thy Care  To thee the highest Bliss is given  A Soul to praise and copy Heaven  Whether it was owing to my Youth or any real Merit in the Verses I know not but weak as they were from the Candour of the Company they met with great Applause and the worthy Gentleman to whom they were directed praised the Poetry extremely only modestly wished I had a better Sub∣ject to employ my fine Genius as he was pleased to call it  I hope if I should live to publish these Writings none of the honourable Persons mentioned in them as having been once my Friends will be offended at it since whate∣ver Misfortunes have since befallen me I was not then quite unworthy of the Re∣gard they shewed me and still retain a grateful Sense of their Favour only la∣menting that by one fatal Folly it is irreco∣verably lost  And now I must confess as I have talked of Ambition I had a strong one to be known to Dr  Swift  As Dr  Delany  had recommended and introduced Mr  Pn  to him and the learned Lady beforementioned I thought it a little hard to be excluded from the Delight and In∣struction I might possibly receive from such Conversation and having often re∣monstrated on this Head to no Purpose I at last told them for to give me my due I was pretty pert  'that truly they were envious and would not let me see the Dean knowing how much I surpassed them all'  As I spoke this but half se∣rious I set them all a laughing and as they were to meet the next Day at the DeaneryHouse to keep the Anniversary of his Birthday I inclosed to Dr  Delany  the following Lines  To the Rev Dr  SWIFT  on his  Birthday  WHILE I the Godlike Men of Old  In Admiration wrapt behold  Rever'd Antiquity explore  And turn the longliv'd Volumes o'er  Where  Cato Plutarch Flaccus  shine  In ev'ry Excellence divine  I grieve that our degen'rate Days  Produce no mighty Souls like these  Patriot Philosopher and Bard  Are Names unknown and seldom heard  Spare your Reflection  Phoebus  cries  'Tis as ungrateful as unwise  Can you complain this sacred Day  That Virtues or that Arts decay  Behold in SWIFT reviv'd appears  The Virtues of unnumber'd Years  Behold in him with new Delight  The Patriot Bard and Sage unite  And know  Ierne  in that Name  Shall rival  Greece  and  Rome  in Fame  Dr  Delany  presented these Lines to the Dean and at the same time told him my saucy Speech abovementioned The Dean kindly accepted of my Compliment and said  'He would see me whenever I pleas∣ed'  A most welcome Message to me  A few Days after the Dean sent the Doctor Word he would dine with him at  Delville  and desired to meet Mr and Mrs  Pn  there You may be assured I obeyed this welcome Summons and a Gen∣tlewoman  was so kind as to call on me to go with her when we arrived Dr  De∣lany  's Servant told us his Master the Dean and Mr  Pn  were walking in the Garden we met them on a noble Terrass whose Summit was crowned with a mag∣nificent Portico where Painting and Sculp∣ture displayed their utmost Charms The Lady presented me to the Dean who sa∣luted me and surprized me by asking her  'If I was her Daughter'  She smiled and said  'I was Mrs  Pn  '  'What says he this poor little Child married God help her she is early engaged in Trouble'  We passed the Day in a most elegant and delightful Manner and the Dean engag∣ing Mr  Pn  to preach for him at the Cathedral the  Sunday  following gave me also with the rest of the Company an Invi∣tation to Dinner As the Communion is administered every  Sunday  in this antique Church dedicated to St  Patrick  the first Prelate who taught the Gospel in  Ireland  I was charmed to see with what a becoming Piety the Dean performed that solemn Ser∣vice which he had so much at Heart that  he wanted not the Assistance of the Litur∣gy but went quite thro' it without ever looking in the PrayerBook Indeed an∣other Part of his Behaviour on this Occa∣sion was censured by some as savouring of  Popery  which was that he bowed to the HolyTable however this Circumstance may vindicate him from the wicked Asper∣sion of being deemed an Unbeliever since 'tis plain he had the utmost Reverence for the Eucharist Service being over we met the Dean at the ChurchDoor sur∣rounded by a Crowd of Poor to all of whom he gave Charity excepting one old Woman who held out a very dirty Hand to him he told her very gravely  'That though she was a Beggar Water was not so scarce but she might have washed her Hands'  And so we marched with the Silver Verge before us to the DeaneryHouse When we came into the Parlour the Dean kindly saluted me and without allowing me Time to sit down bade me come and see his Study Mr  Pn  was for following us but the Dean told him merrily He did not desire his Company  and so he ventured to trust me with him into the Library  'Well says he I have brought you here to shew you all the Mo∣ney I got when I was in the Ministry but do not steal any of it'  'I will not indeed Sir says I'  so he opened a Ca∣binet and shewed me a whole Parcel of empty Drawers  'Bless me say he the Money is flown'  he then opened his Bureau wherein he had a great Number of curious Trinkets of various Kinds some of which he told me  'Were presented to him by the Earl and Countess of  Oxford  some by Lady  Masham  and some by La∣dy  Betty Germain  '  at last coming to a Drawer filled with Medals he bade me chuse two for myself but he could not help smiling when I began to poize them in my Hands chusing them by Weight rather than Antiquity of which indeed I was not then a Judge  The Dean amused me in this Manner till we were summoned to Dinner where his Behaviour was so humorous that I cannot avoid relating some Part of it He placed himself at the Head of his Table opposite  to a great PierGlass under which was a Marble Sideboard so that he could see in the Glass whatever the Servants did at it He was served entirely in Plate and with great Elegance but the Beef being over∣roasted put us all in Confusion the Dean called for the Cookmaid and ordered her to take it down Stairs and do it less the Maid answered very innocently  'That she could not'  'Why what Sort of a Crea∣ture are you says he to commit a Fault which cannot be amended'  And turning to me he said very gravely  'That he hoped as the Cook was a Woman of Genius he should by this Manner of ar∣guing be able in about a Year's Time to convince her she had better send up the Meat too little than too much done'  charging the Men Servants  'Whenever they imagined the Meat was ready they should take it Spit and all and bring it up by Force promising to aid them in case the Cook resisted'  The Dean then turning his Eye on the Lookingglass es∣pied the Butler opening a Bottle of Ale and helping himself to the first Glass he  very kindly jumbled the rest together that his Master and Guests might all fare alike  'Ha Friend says the Dean Sharp's the Word I find you drank my Ale for which I stop two Shillings of your BoardWages this Week for I scorn to be out∣done in any thing even in cheating'  Dinner at last was over to my great Joy for now I had Hope of a more agreeable Entertainment than what the squabbling with the Servants had afforded us  The Dean thanked Mr  Pn  for his Sermon  'I never says he preached but twice in my Life and then they were not Sermons but Pamphlets'  I asked him  'What might be the Subject of them'  he told me  'They were against  Wood  's Halfpence'  'Pray Madam says he do you smoke'  'No indeed Sir says I'  'Nor your Husband'  'Neither Sir'  'It is a Sign said he you were neither of you bred in the Univer∣sity of  Oxford  for drinking and smoak∣ing are the first Rudiments of Learning taught there and in those two Arts no University in  Europe  can outdo them'  'Pray Mrs  Pn  tell me your Faults'  'Indeed Sir I must beg to be excused for if I can help it you shall never find them out'  'No says he then Mr  Pn  shall tell me'  'I will Sir says he when I have discovered them'  'Pray Mr Dean says Dr  Delany  why will you be so unpolite as to suppose Mrs  Pn  has any Faults'  'Why I will tell you replied the Dean whenever I see a Number of agreeable Qualities in any Person I am always sure they have bad ones sufficient to poize the Scale'  I bowed and told the Dean  'He did me great Honour'  And in this I copied Bi∣shop  Berkley  whom I have frequently heard declare  'That when any Speech was made to him which might be construed either into a Compliment or an Affront or that to make use of his own Word had two Handles he was so meek and so mild that he always took hold of the best'  The Dean then asked me  'If I was a Queen what I should chuse to have after Dinner'  I answered  'His Conversa∣tion'  'Phooh says he I mean what Regale'  'A Dish of Coffee Sir'  'Why then I will so far make you as hap∣py as a Queen you shall have some in Perfection for when I was Chaplain to the Earl of  Berkley  who was in the Go∣vernment here I was so poor I was ob∣liged to keep a Coffeehouse and all the Nobility resorted to it to talk Treason'  I could not help smiling at this Oddity but I really had such an Awe on me that I could not venture to ask him as I longed to do what it meant The Bottle and Glasses being taken away the Dean set a∣bout making the Coffee but the Fire scorching his Hand he called to me to reach him his Glove and changing the Coffeepot to his Lefthand held out his Right one ordered me to put the Glove on it which accordingly I did when taking up Part of his Gown to fan himself with and acting in Character of a prudish Lady he said  'Well I do not know what to think Women may be honest that do such Things but for my Part I never could bear to touch any Man's Flesh  except my Husband's whom perhaps says he she wished at the Devil  'Mr  Pn  says he you would not tell me your Wife's Faults but I have found her out to be a dned insolent proud unmannerly Slut'  I looked con∣founded not knowing what Offence I had committedSays Mr  Pn  'Ay Sir I must confess she is a little saucy to me sometimes butwhat has she done now'  'Done why nothing but sat there quietly and never once offered to interrupt me in making the Coffee whereas had I had a Lady of modern good Breeding here she would have struggled with me for the Coffeepot till she had made me scald myself and her and made me throw the Coffee in the Fire or per∣haps at her Head rather than permit me to take so much trouble for her'  This raised my Spirits and as I found the Dean always prefaced a Compliment with an Affront I never afterwards was startled at the latter as too many have been not entering into his peculiarly ironical Strain but was modestly contented with  the former which was more than I deserv∣ed and which the Surprize rendered doubly pleasing  By this Time the Bell rang for Church and Dr  Delany  and Mr  Pn  who with myself were now all the Company for the rest departed before the Coffee was out were obliged to attend the Summons But as there is no Service in the Cathedral but EveningPrayer at Six o'Clock I chose rather to attend the Dean there than go to hear another Sermon by this means I had him all to myself for near three Hours during which Time he made me read to him the Annals of the four last Years of the Reign of Queen  Anne  written by him∣self the Intentions of which seemed to be a Vindication of the then Ministry and him∣self from having any Design of placing the Pretender on the Throne of  GreatBritain  It began with a solemn Adjuration that all the Facts therein contained were Truth and then proceeded in the Manner of Lord  Clarendon  with giving the particular Cha∣racters of every Person whom he should have occasion to mention amongst whom  I remember he compared Lord  Bolling∣broke  to  Petronius  one who agreeably mingled Business with Pleasure At the Conclusion of every Period he demanded of me  'Whether I understood it For I would says he have it intelligent to the meanest Capacity and if you compre∣prehend it 'tis possible every Body may'  'I bowed and assured him I did'  And indeed it was written with such Perspecuity and Elegance of Stile that I must have had no Capacity at all if I did not taste what was so exquisitely beautiful  Mr  Pn  when he was Chaplain to Alderman  Barber  in the Year of his Mayoralty mentioned those Annals to Mr  Pope  who said he had dissuaded the Dean from publishing them as the Facts contained in them were notoriously false I was greatly astonished when Mr  Pn  told me this nor could I tell what to deter∣mine It seemed strange to me that a Person of the Dean's good Sense and Ve∣racity should in the most solemn manner invocate the Almighty to bear Testimony to Falshoods publicly known to be such  And yet as Mr  Pope  was in Prose a Man of unquestioned Probity and united to the Dean in the strictest Bonds of Friendship and consequently without doubt well ac∣quainted with the Transactions of those Times we can hardly suppose he would speak in the manner he did without just Grounds for so doing and his Evidence seems strengthened by his being of the  Ro∣mish  Religion which must certainly incline him to wish well to a Prince of the same Faith However upon the whole I am inclined to judge charitably of the Dean and to believe that tho' the Ministers fre∣quently employed him as a Writer and en∣tertained him as a Companion yet they had not let him into the Depth of their De∣signs  the Mystery of Iniquity  So that what he relates in his Annals of the invio∣lable Attachment of those in Power to the  Hanover  Succession and the  Protestant  Faith might be by him believed to be Truth For who so wise but may be de∣ceived And perhaps Mr  Pope  's long and intimate Correspondence with Lord  Bolling∣broke  gave him a better Knowledge of  what was really intended at that critical Juncture Pardon this Digression  The Bell rang for EveningPrayer to which I accompanied the Dean There is a fine Organ in this Church which with its antique Magnificence and so harmonious a Choir brought  Milton  's Lines into my Mind  And let my due Feet never fail  To walk the studious Cloysters pale  And love the high embowed Roof  With antique Pillars massy Proof  And story'd Windows richly dight  Shedding a dim religious Light  There let the pealing Organ blow  To the fullvoic'd Choir below  In Service high and Anthem clear  Which may with Pleasure thro' mine Ear  Dissolve me into Extasies  And bring all Heaven before my Eyes  On our Return to the Deaneryhouse we found there waiting our coming Dr  Delany  and Mr  Rochford  to whose Wife  A Letter of Advice to a newmarried Lady  published since in the Dean's Works was written and which by the bye the Lady did not take as a Compliment either to her or the Sex Mr  Pn  Dr  Sheridan  Author of the Art of Punning with two or three other Clergymen who usually passed  Sunday  Evening with the Dean Mr  Pn  and I were for going Home but the Dean told us  'He gave us leave to stay to Supper'  which from him was a sufficient Invitation The Dean then pulled out of his Pocket a little Gold Runlet in which was a BottleScrew and opening a Bottle of Wine he decanted it off the last Glass being muddy he called to Mr  Pn  to drink it  'For says he I always keep some poor Parson to drink the foul Wine for me'  Mr  Pn  entering into his Humour thank∣ed him and told him  'He did not know the Difference but was glad to get a Glass at any rate'  'Why then says the Dean you shan't for I'll drink it my∣self Why Px take you you are wiser than a paultry Curate whom I asked to dine with me a few Days ago  for upon my making the same Speech to him he told me he did not understand such Usage and so walked off without his Dinner By the same Token I told the Gentleman who recommended him to me That the Fellow was a Blockhead and I had done with him'  The Dean then missing his Golden BottleScrew told me very sternly  'He was sure I had stolen it'  I affirmed very serious∣ly  'I had not'  Upon which he looked for it and found it where he himself had laid it  ''Tis well for you says he that I have got it or I would have charged you with Theft'  'Why pray Sir should I be suspected more than any other Per∣son in the Company'  'For a very good Reason says he because you are the poorest'  There now came in to sup with the Dean one of the oddest little Mortals I ever met with He formerly wrote the  Gazetteer  and upon the Strength of be∣ing an Author and of having travelled took upon him not only to dictate to the Company but to contradict whatever any  other Person advanced Right or Wrong till he had entirely silenced them all And then having the whole Talk to himself for to my great Surprize the Dean neither interrupted nor shewed any Dislike of him he told us a whole String of Improbabi∣lities such as  'That each Pillar of St  Peter  's at  Rome  took up more Ground than a Convent which was near it where∣in were twelve Monks with their Cha∣pel Garden and Infirmary'  By this Account every Pillar must take up at least half an Acre and considering the Number of them we must conclude the Edifice to be some Miles in Circumference No one present had ever been at  Rome  except himself so that he might tell us just what he thought proper  I took notice that before this dogma∣tical Gentleman the Dean was most re∣markably complaisant to Mr  Pn  and me and at our going away the Dean would hand me down all the Steps to the Coach thanking us for the Honour of our Company at the same time sliding into my Hand as much Money as Mr  Pn  and I had given at the Offering in the Morning and Coachhire also which I durst not refuse lest I should have been deemed as great a Blockhead as the Parson who refused the thick Wine  It has been a Matter of Dispute amongst the Learned whether  England  or  Ireland  had the Honour of giving to the World this admirable Person 'tis probable Posterity may contend this Point as warmly as the seven Cities of  Greece  did the Birthplace of  Homer  And tho' in reality 'tis of no great Importance where a Man is born yet as the  Irish  are the eternal Ridicule of the  English  for their Ignorance I am proud  Hibernia  had the Happiness of producing this brilliant Wit to redeem the Credit of the Country and to convince the World a Man may draw his first Breath there and yet be learned wise generous religi∣ous witty social and polite  The Account I have frequently heard the Dean give of himself was that he was born in  Hoey'sAlley  in  Warburgh  's Parish  Dublin  his Father was a Lawyer and re∣turning from the Circuit he unfortunately  brought home the Itch with him which he had got by lying in some foul Bed on the Road Somebody advised him to use Mercury to cure it which Prescription cost him his Life in a very few Days after his Return The Dean was a posthumous Son to this Gentleman but as he said came Time enough to save his Mother's Credit He was given to an  Irish  Woman to nurse whose Husband being in  England  and writing to her to come to him as she could not bear the Thoughts of parting with the Child she very fairly took him with her unknown to his Mother or any of his Relations who could learn no Tid∣ings either of him or her for three Years at the End of which Time she returned to  Ireland  and restored the Child to his Mo∣ther from whom she easily obtained a Par∣don both on account of the Joy she con∣ceived at seeing her only Son again when she had in a manner lost all Hope of it as also that it was plain the Nurse had no other Motive for stealing him but pure Affection which the Women of  I  land  generally have in as eminent Degree for  the Children they nurse as for their own Offspring  I believe the Dean's early Youth did not promise that bright Day of Wit which has since enlightened the learned World Whilst he was at the University of  Dublin  he was so far from being distinguished for any Superiority of Parts or Learning that he was stopped of his Degree as a Dunce When I heard the Dean relate this Circum∣stance for I set down nothing but what I had from his own Mouth I told him I supposed he had been idle but he affirmed to the contrary assuring me he was real∣ly dull which if true is very surprising  I have often been led to look on the World as a Garden and the human Minds as so many Plants set by the Hand of the great Creator for Utility and Ornament Thus some we see early produce beauti∣ful Blossoms and as soon fade away others whose Gems are more slow in un∣folding but more permanent when blown and others again who tho' longer in arriving at Perfection not only bless us then with Shade and Odour but also with  delicious wholesome Fruit To go on with the Allegory we often hear from Chil∣dren very bright Sallies of Wit and Re∣flections above their Years From these hopeful Beginnings we are apt to expect something very extraordinary in their Ma∣turity but how often are we disappointed How often do we see these sparkling Chil∣dren dwindle gradually into the most hum∣drum Men and Women as if to make use of the Florists Phrase the  Blow  was quite over and some whose Childhood has given no Presages of great Talents have improved every Year till they have brought forth the beautiful Flowers of Poetry and Rhetorick and the rich Fruits of Wisdom and Virtue  Whether this Comparison will hold I submit to the Judgment of those who are better acquainted with the secret Workings of Nature than I can presume to be I am afraid of going out of my Depth and yet I have a great Inclination to say a little more on this Subject  I have known a Person who in his Youth was an extraordinary Adept in Music and  performed on several Instruments extreme∣ly well I saw the same Person some Years after and lo his musical Talent was entire∣ly lost and he was then a very good Painter Now I could not help forming a Notion in my own Mind that as our Ideas depend on the Fibres of the Brain it was possible we might by the continual Use of some particular one weaken it so as to make it perish and at the same time another might exert from that very Cause itself with dou∣ble Strength Thus I suppose when this Gentleman's musical Fibres perished his painting ones shot forth with Vigour If there be any Truth in this Whim of mine which I own I am fond of believing my∣self we may easily account for the various Dispositions which we meet with even in the same Person at different Periods of Life  But to return Altho' it is not in my Power to give a succinct Account of the Dean's Life neither have I any intention to attempt it yet I believe I am better qualified to do it than most of those who have undertaken it as they were absolute  Strangers to him and relate Things upon Hearsay The Dean for the latter Part of his Life contracting his Acquaintance into a very narrow Compass for as he was fre∣quently deaf he thought this Infirmity made him troublesome and therefore kept no Company but such as he could be so free with as to bid them speak loud or repeat what they had said it was owing to this that Mr  Pn  and I frequently passed whole Days with him while Numbers of our betters were excluded and as he was like another  Nestor  full of Days and Wis∣dom so like him he was pretty much upon the Narrative than which nothing could be more delightful to me as Pleasure and Instruction flowed from his Lips  His Words  Drew Audience and Attention still as Night  Or Summer's Noontide Air  MIL  I remember in one of these periodica  Fits of Deafness for they returned on cer¦tain Seasons on him he sent for me earl  in the Morning he told me when I came  he had found Employment for me so he brought to me out of his Study a large Book very finely bound in  Turkey  Lea∣ther and handsomely gilt this says he is a Translation of the Epistles of  Horace  a Present to me from the Author it is a spe∣cial good Cover But I have a Mind there should be something valuable within side of it so taking out his Penknife he cut out all the Leaves close to the inner Mar∣gin Now says he I will give these what they greatly want and put them all into the Fire He then brought out two Draw∣ers filled with Letters Your Task Ma∣dam is to paste in these Letters in this Cover in the Order I shall give them to you I intended to do it myself but that I thought it might be a pretty Amusement for a Child so I sent for you I told him I was extremely proud to be honoured with his Commands But Sir may I presume to make a Request to you yes says he but ten to one I shall deny it I hope not Sir it is this may I have leave to read the Letters as I go on Why provided you will acknowledge yourself amply re∣warded  for your Trouble I do not much care if I indulge you so far but are you sure you can read I do not know Sir I will try Well then begin with this It was a Letter from Lord  Bolingbroke  dated six o'Clock in the Morning it began with a Remark how differently that Hour ap∣peared to him now rising cool serene and temperate to contemplate the Beauties of Nature to what it had done in some for∣mer Parts of his Life when he was either in the midst of Excesses or returning Home sated with them so he proceeded to describe the numberless Advantages with which Temperance and Virtue bless their Votaries and the Miseries which attend a contrary Course The Epistle was pretty long and the most refined Piece of moral Philosophy I ever met with as indeed eve∣ry one of his were and I had the unspeak∣able Delight of reading several of them  Nor can I be at all surprized that Mr  Pope  should so often celebrate a Genius who for Sublimity of Thought and Ele∣gance of Stile had few Equals The rest of the Dean's Correspondents were the  Lady  Masham  the Earl of  Oxford  Dr  Atterbury  Bishop  Burnet  Lord  Bathurst  Mr  Addison  Archdeacon  Parnell  Mr  Congreve  Mr  Pultney  Mr  Pope  Mr  Gay  Dr  Arbuthnot  a noble and a learn∣ed Set So my Readers may judge what a Banquet I had I could not avoid remark∣ing to the Dean that notwithstanding the Friendship Mr  Pope  professed for Mr  Gay  he could not forbear a great many satirical or if I may be allowed to say so envious Remarks on the Success of the  Beggar's Opera  The Dean very frankly owned he did not think Mr  Pope  was so candid to the Merits of other Writers as he ought to be I then ventured to ask the Dean whe∣ther he thought the Lines Mr  Pope  ad∣dresses him with in the Beginning of the  Dunciad  were any Compliment to him  viz  O thou whatever Title please thine Ear  Dunciad  'I believe says he they were meant as such but they are very stiff'  'Indeed  Sir said I he is so perfectly a Master of harmonious Number that had his Heart been in the least affected with his Subject he must have writ better'  'How cold how forced are his Lines to you com∣pared with yours to him'  See  Swift  's Libel on Lord  Carteret  Hail happy  Pope  whose generous Mind  Here we see the masterly Poet and the warm sincere generous Friend while he according to the Character he gives of Mr  Addison  damns with faint Praise  'Well replied the Dean I will shew you a late Letter of his to me'  he did so and I own I was surprized to find it filled with low and ungentlemanlike Reflections both on Mr  Gay  and the two noble Persons who honoured him with their Patronage after his Disappointment at Court  'Well Madam said the Dean what do you think of that Letter seeing I had gone quite through it  'Indeed Sir re∣turned I I am sorry I have read it for it gives me Reason to think there is no  such thing as a sincere Friend to be met with in the World'  'Why replied he Authors are as jealous of their Preroga∣tive as Kings and can no more bear a Rival in the Empire of Wit than a Mo∣narch could in his Dominions'  'But Sir said I here is a  Latin  Sentence writ in  Italics  which I suppose means some∣thing particular will you be so kind to explain it'  'No replied he smilingI will leave that for your Husband to doI will send for him to come and dine with us and in the mean time we will go and take a Walk in  Naboth  's Vineyard'  'Where may that be pray Sir'  'Why a GardenI cheated one of my Neighbours out of'  When we entered the Garden or rather the Field which was square and inclosed with a Stone Wall the Dean asked me how I liked it  'Why pray said I where is the Garden'  'Look behind you'  said he I did so and observed the South Wall was lined with Brick and a great Num∣ber of Fruit Trees planted against it which being then in Blossom looked very beau∣tiful  'What are you so intent on said the Dean'  'The opening Blooms Sir which brought  Waller  's Lines to my Re∣membrance  Hope waits upon the flow'ry Prime  'Oh replied he you are in a poetical Vein I thought you had been taking Notice of my Wall it is the best in  Ire∣land  when the Masons were building it as most Tradesmen are Rogues I watched them very close and as often as they could they put in a rotten Stone of which however I took no Notice till they had built three or four Perches be∣yond it now as I am an absolute Monarch in the  Liberties  Liberties  belonging to the Dean  and King of the Mob my Way with them was to have the Wall thrown down to the Place where I observed the rotten Stone and by doing so five or six Times the Workmen were at last convinced it was their Interest to be honest'  or else Sir said I your Wall  'would have been as tedious a Piece of  Work as  Penelope  's Web if all that was done in the Day was to be undone at Night'  'Well answered he I find you have Poetry for every Occasion but as you cannot keep Pace with me in walk∣ing for indeed I was not quite so light then as I had been some Months before I would have you sit down on that little Bank till you are rested or I tired to put us more upon a Par'  I seated myself and away the Dean walk∣ed or rather trolled as hard as ever he could drive I could not help smiling at his odd Gait for I thought to myself he had written to so much in Praise of Horses that he was resolved to imitate them as nearly as he could As I was indulging this Fancy the Dean returned to me and gave me a strong Confirmation of his Par∣tiality to those Animals  'I have been considering Madam as I walked said he what a Fool Mr  Pn  was to marry you for he could have afforded to keep a Horse for less Money than you cost him and that you must confess would have given him better Exercise and  more Pleasure than a WifeWhy you laugh and do not answer meis not it Truth'  'I must answer you Sir with another Question Pray how can a Batchelor judge of this Matter'  'I find said he you are vain enough to give yourself the Preference'  'I do Sir to that Species here a  Huyoniam  I would as becomes me give Place to But Sir it is going to rain'  'I hope not said he for that will cost me Sixpence for a Coach for you this Garden being at some Distance from his House come haste O how the Tester trembles in my Pocket'  I obeyed and we got in a Doors just Time enough to escape a heavy Shower  'Thank God said the Dean I have saved my Money here you Fel∣low to his Servant carry this Sixpence to the lame old Man that sells Ginger∣bread at the Corner because he tries to do something and does not beg'  The Dean shewed me into a little StreetParlour where sat his Housekeeper a matronlike Gentlewoman at Work  'Here says he Mrs  Brent  take Care of this  Child meaning me and see she does no Mischief while I take my Walk out within Doors'  The DeaneryHouse has I know not how many Pair of BackStairs in it the preceding Dean who built it being it seems extremely fearful of Fire was resolved there should be many Ways to escape in case of Danger  The Dean then ran up the GreatStairs down one Pair of BackStairs up another in so violent a Manner that I could not help expressing my Uneasiness to the good Gentlewoman lest he should fall and be hurted she said  'It was a customary Ex∣ercise with him when the Weather did not permit him to walk abroad'  I told Mrs  Brent  'I believed the Dean was extremely charitable'  'Indeed Ma∣dam replied she No body can be more so his Income is not above six hundred Pounds a Year and every Year he gives above the Half of it in private Pensions to decayed Families besides this he keeps five hundred Pounds in the constant Ser∣vice of the industrious Poor This he lends out in five Pounds at a Time and  takes the Payment back at twelve Pence a Week this does them more Service than if he gave it to them entirely as it obliges them to work and at the same Time keeps up this charitable Fund for the Assistance of many You cannot i∣magine what Numbers of poor Tradesmen who have even wanted proper Tools to carry on their Work have by this small Loan been put into a prosperous Way and brought up their Families in Credit The Dean added she has found out a new Method of being charitable in which however I believe he will have but few Followers which is to debar himself of what he calls the Superfluities of Life in order to administer to the Necessities of the Distressed you just now saw an In∣stance of it the Money a Coach would have cost him he gave to a poor Man unable to walk when he dines alone he drinks a Pint of Beer and gives away the Price of a Pint of Wine and thus he acts in numberless Instances'  My Reader will I hope do me the Jus∣tice to believe I was quite charmed with this  Account of the Dean's beneficent Spirit and I no longer wondered so many of the Clergy endeavoured to depreciate him for as it is well known there are not in the general a more voluptuous Set of Men living this Doctrine of  Selfdenial  was enough to make them pour out all their Anathema's on him and brand him with the Name of  Atheist  Unbeliever and such like Terms as they in their Christian Zeal thought proper to bestow  I before admired the Dean as a Person of distinguished Genius but now I learned to revere him as the Angel of  Ireland  The Dean running into the Parlour threw a whole Packet of Manuscript Poems into my Lap and so he did for five or six Times successively till I had an Apron full of Wit and Novelty for they were all of his own Writing and such as had not then been made public and many of them I believe never will Mr  Pn  coming according to the Dean's Desire to Dinner found me deeply engaged and sat down to partake of my Entertainment till we were summoned to Table to a less  noble Part  'Well Mr  Pn  said the Dean I hope you are jealous I have had your Wife a good many Hours and as she is a likely Girl and I a very young Man  Note  he was upwards of Threescore you do not know what may have happened Tho' I must tell you you are very partial to her for here I have not been acquainted with her above six Months and I have al∣ready discovered two intolerable Faults in her 'tis true I looked sharp or per∣haps they might have escaped my No∣tice Nay Madam do not look sur∣prised I am resolved to tell your Hus∣band that he may break you of them'  'Indeed Sir returned I my Surprize is that you have not found out two and fifty in half that time but let me know them and I will mend of them if I can'  'Well put in says he for I be∣lieve you can't but eat your Dinner however for they are not capital'  I obeyed yet was very impatient to know my particular Errors he told me  'I should hear of them Time enough'  The Things being taken away  'Now good Sir said I tell me what I do amiss that I may reform'  'No returned he but I'll tell your Husband before your Face to shame you the moreIn the first Place Mr  Pn  she had the in∣solence this Morning not only to desire to read the Writings of the most cele∣brated Genius's of the Age in which I indulged her but she must also for∣sooth pretend to praise or censure them' as if she knew something of the Matter indeed her Remarks were not much a∣miss considering they were GuessWork but this Letter here of Mr  Pope  's she has absolutely condemned read it he did so take notice of it said the Dean she would also have had me explain that  Latin  Sentence to her but I had some Modesty tho' she had none you see'  'Why Sir said I sure Mr  Pope  would not especially to you write any thing which even a Virgin might not read'  Now Mr  Pn  'said the Dean is her Curiosity at work I'll be hang'd if she lets you sleep to∣night till you have satisfied it But this  is not all she had the Vanity to affirm that she thought herself preferable to a Horse and more capable of giving you pleasure Nay she laugh'd in my Face for being of a different Opinion and asked me how a Batchelor should know any thing of the Matter If you don't take down her Pride there will be no bearing her'  'Indeed Sir said Mr  Pn  'tis your Fault that she is so conceited she was always disposed to be saucy but since you have done her the honour to take notice of her and make her your Companion there is no such thing as mortifying her'  'Very fine said the Dean I have got much by complaining to you to have all your Wife's Faults laid at my Door'  'Well Sir said I all these Misdemeanors may be included under the Article of  Pride  Now let me know my other Crime'  'Why said he you can't walk fast but at pre∣sent I excuse you'  'Well Sir if I can't mend my Pride I'll try to mend my Pace'  Mr  Pn  said he I  'have a mind to clip your Wife's Wit'  'Indeed Sir said I that's Death by Law for 'tis Sterling'  'Shut up your Mouth for all Day  Letty  said Mr  Pn  for that Answer is real Wit'  Nay 'said the Dean I believe we had better shut up our own for at this rate she'll be too many for us'  I am sure if I was not proud before this was enough to make me so  The Dean guessed right when he said I would not let Mr  Pn  sleep till he had explained to me the  Latin  Sentence in Mr  Pope  's Letter which at my Request he did And indeed none but such a wicked Wit could have contrived to turn the Words of our blessed Saviour so as to make them convey a very impure as well as a most uncharitable Idea to the Mind  Feuds ran so high between my Mother and Mr  Pn  that my Life became very unhappy So we determined to quit my Father's House for a little one of our own which my Husband's Father made us a Present of and which by the Bounty of our Friends who came a House∣warming  to us was soon elegantly fur∣nished there was a large Garden to it which Mr  Pn  laid out in a most beautiful Taste and built a delightful Sum∣merhouse in it fit indeed for a Nobleman here we usually entertained our Friends here also we both invoked the Muse Mr  Pn  coming in Curate by the Remo∣val of Dr  Owens  to a Living of whose Behaviour to me in my Misfortunes I shall have occasion to speak and by having the Honour of being Chaplain to Lady  Charlemont  with an annual Allowance I had from my Father our Income was about one hundred Pounds a Year so that having no Rent to pay and having my Father's Coach and Table always at our Command we could in so cheap a Coun∣try as  Ireland  live in a very decent Man∣ner as Dr  Swift  mentions our doing in a Letter of his to Mr  Pope  now pub∣lished amongst others  The Dean came to dine with us in our  Lilliputian  Palace as he called it and who could have thought it He just looked into the Parlour and ran up into the Gar∣ret  then into my Bedchamber and Li∣brary and from thence down to the Kit∣chen and well it was for me that the House was very clean for he compli∣mented me on it and told me  'That was his Custom and that 'twas from the Cleanliness of the Garret and Kitchen he judged of the good Housewifery of the Mistress of the House for no doubt but a Slut would have the Rooms clean where the Guests were to be entertained'  He really was sometimes very rude even to his Superiors of which the following Story related to me by himself may serve as one Instance amongst a thousand others  The last time he was in  London  he went to dine with the Earl of  Burlington  who was then but newly married My Lord being willing I suppose to have some Di∣version did not introduce him to his La∣dy nor mention his Name 'Tis to be observed his Gown was generally very rusty and his Person no way extraordinaryAfter Dinner said the Dean  'Lady  Burlington  I hear you can sing sing me a Song'  The Lady looked on this  unceremonious manner of asking a Favour with Distaste and positively refused him He said she should sing or he would make her  'Why Madam I suppose you take me for one of your poor paul∣try  English  Hedge Parsons sing when I bid you'  As the Earl did nothing but laugh at this Freedom the Lady was so vexed that she burst into Tears and retired  His first Compliment to her when he saw her again was  'Pray Madam are you as proud and as illnatured now as when I saw you last'  To which she an∣swered with great good Humour  'No Mr Dean I'll sing for you if you please'  From which time he con∣ceived great Esteem for her But who that knew him would take offence at his Bluntness It seems Queen  Caroline  did not if we may credit his own Lines wherein he declares That he  With Princes kept a due Decorum  But never stood in Awe before 'em  And to the present Queen God bless her  Would speak as free as to her Dresser  She thought it his peculiar Whim  Nor took it illas come from him  SWIFT on his own Death  I cannot recollect that ever I saw the Dean laugh perhaps he thought it beneath him for when any Pleasantry passed which might have excited it he used to suck in his Cheeks as Folks do when they have a Plug of Tobacco in their Mouths to avoid Risibility He frequent∣ly put me in mind of  Shakespear  's Descrip∣tion of  Cassius  He is a great Discerner and he looks  Quite thro' the Deeds of Men  Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort  As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his Spirit  That could be mov'd to smile at any thing  JULIUS CAESAR  As the Dean and after his Example Mr  Pn  were eternally satyrizing and  ridiculing the  Female  Sex I had a very great inclination to be even with them and expose the Inconstancy of Men and bor∣rowing a Hint from a Story in the  Peru∣vian  Tales I formed from it the follow∣ing Poem and I hope it will be acceptable to my fair Readers as it is peculiarly ad∣dressed to them  The STATUES Or the Trial of CONSTANCY A TALE  For the LADIES  IN a fair Island in the Southern Main  Blest with indulgent Skies and kindly Rain  A Princess liv'd of Origin divine  Of Bloom celestial and Imperial Line  In that sweet Season when the mounting Sun  Prepares with Joy his radiant Course to run  Led by the Graces and the dancing Hours  And wakes to Life the various Race of Flowers  The lovely Queen forsook her shining Court  For rural Scenes and healthful sylvan Sport  It so befel that as in chearful Talk  Her Nymphs and she pursu'd their Evening Walk  On the green Margin of the oozy Deep  They found a graceful Youth dissolv'd in Sleep  Whose Charms the Queen survey'd with fond Delight  And hung enamour'd o'er the pleasing Sight  By her Command the Youth was strait convey'd  And sleeping softly in her Palace laid  Now ruddy Morning purpled o'er the Skies  And beamy Light unseal'd the Stranger's Eyes  Who cry'd aloud Ye Gods unfold this Scene  Where am I What can all these Wonders mean  Scarce had he spoke when with officious Care  Attendant Nymphs a fragrant Bath prepare  He rose he bath'd and on his lovely Head  Ambrosial Sweets and precious Oil they shed  To deck his polish'd Limbs a Robe they brought  In all the various Dyes of Beauty wrought  Then led him to the Queen who on a Throne  Of burnish'd Gold and beamy Diamonds shone  But oh what Wonder seiz'd her beauteous Guest  What Love what Extasy his Soul possest  Entranc'd he stood and on his falt'ring Tongue  Imperfect Words and halfform'd Accents hung  Nor less the Queen the blooming Youth admir'd  Nor less Delight and Love her Soul inspir'd  O Stranger said the Queen if hither driven  By adverse Winds or sent a Guest from Heav'n  To me the wretched never sue in vain  This fruitful Isle acknowledges my Reign  Then speak thy Wishes and thy Wants declare  And no Denial shall attend your Pray'r  She paus'd and blush'dthe Youth his Silence broke  And kneeling thus the charming Queen bespoke  O Goddess for a Form so bright as thine  Speaks thee descended of celestial Line  Low at your Feet a prostrate King behold  Whose faithless Subjects sold his Life for Gold  I fly a cruel Tyrant's lawless Hand  And Shipwreck drove my Vessel on your Strand  But why do I complain of Fortune's Frowns  Or what are Titles Honours Scepters Crowns  To this sweet Moment While in fond Amaze  On such transporting Excellence I gaze  Such Symmetry of Shape so fair a Face  Such finish'd Excellence such perfect Grace  Hear then my only Wish and oh approve  The ardent Prayer which supplicates thy Love  From  Neptune  know O Prince my Birth I claim  Replies the Queen and  Lucida  's my Name  This Island these attendant Nymphs he gave  The fairhair'd Daughters of the azure Wave  But he whose Fortune gains me for a Bride  Must have his Constancy severely try'd  One Day each Moon am I compell'd to go  To my great Father's wat'ry Realms below  Where coral Groves coelestial red display  And blazing Di'monds emulate the Day  In this short Absence if your Love endures  My Heart and Empire are for ever yours  And hoary  Neptune  to reward your Truth  Shall crown you with immortal Bloom and Youth  But instant Death will on your Falshood wait  Nor can my Tenderness prevent your Fate  Twice twenty Times in Wedlock's sacred Band  My royal Father join'd my plighted Hand  Twice twenty noble Youths alas are dead  Who in my Absence stain'd the Nuptial Bed  Your Virtues Prince may claim a nobler Throne  But mine is yielded on these Terms alone  Delightful Terms reply'd the raptur'd Youth  Accept my Constancy my endless Truth  Perfidious faithless Men enrag'd he cry'd  They merited the Fate by which they dy'd  Accept a Heart incapable of Change  Thy Beauty shall forbid Desire to range  No other Form shall to mine Eye seem fair  No other Voice attract my list'ning Ear  No Charms but thine shall e'er my Soul approve  So aid thy Vot'ry potent God of Love  Now loud Applauses thro' the Palace ring  The duteous Subjects hail their Godlike King  To feastful Mirth they dedicate the Day  While tuneful Voices chant the nuptial Lay  Love ditty'd Airs hymn'd by the vocal Quire  Sweetly attemper'd to the warbling Lyre  But when the Sun descending sought the Main  And lowbrow'd Night assum'd her silent Reign  They to the Marriagebed convey'd the Bride  And laid the raptur'd Bridegroom by her Side  Now rose the Sun and with auspicious Ray  Dispell'd the dewy Mists and gave the Day  When  Lucida  with anxious Care oppress'd  Thus wak'd her sleeping Lord from downy Rest  Soul of my Soul and Monarch of my Heart  This Day she cry'd this fatal Day we part  Yet if your Love uninjur'd you retain  We soon shall meet in Happiness again  To part no more but rolling Years employ'  In circling Bliss and never fading Joy  Alas my boding Soul is lost in Woe  And from mine Eyes the Tears unbidden flow  Joy of my Life dismiss those needless Fears  Reply'd the King and stay those precious Tears  Should lovely  Venus  leave her native Sky  And at my Feet imploring Fondness lie  E'en she the radiant Queen of soft Desires  Should disappointed burn with hopeless Fires  The Heart of Man the Queen's Experience knew  Perjur'd and false yet wish'd to find him true  She sigh'd retiring and in Regal State  The King conducts her to the Palace Gate  Where sacred  Neptune  's chrystal Chariot stands  The wond'rous Work of his celestial Hands  Six harness'd Swans the bright Machine convey  Swift thro' the Air or pathless wat'ry Way  The Birds with eaglespeed the Air divide  And plunge the Goddess in the sounding Tide  Slow to the Court the pensive King re∣turns  And sighs in secret and in Silence mourns  So in the Grove sad  Philomel  complains  In mournful Accents and melodious Strains  Her plaintive Woes fill the resounding Lawn  From starry  Vesper  to the rosy Dawn  The King to mitigate his tender Pain  Seeks the Apartment of the Virgin Train  With sportive Mirth sad Absence to be∣guile  And bid the melancholy Moments smile  But there deserted lonely Rooms he found  And solitary Silence reign'd around  He call'd aloud when lo a Hag ap∣pears  Bending beneath Deformity and Years  Who said my Liege explain your sacred Will  With Joy your Sov'reign Purpose I fulfil  My Will detested Wretch avoid my Sight  And hide that hideous Shape in endless Night  What does thy Queen o'errun with rude Distrust  Resolve by Force to keep a Husband just  You wrong reply'd the Hag your royal Wife  Whose Care is Love and Love to guard your Life  The Race of Mortals are by Nature frail  And strong Temptations with the Best prevail  Be that my Care he said be thine to send  The Virgin Train let them my Will attend  The Beldam fledThe chearful Nymphs advance  And tread to measur'd Airs the mazy Dance  The raptur'd Prince with greedy Eye sur∣veys  The bloomy Maids and covets still to gaze  No more recals the Image of his Spouse  How false is Man nor recollects his Vows  With wild Inconstancy for all he burns  And ev'ry Nymph subdues his Heart by turns  At length a Maid superior to the rest  Array'd in Smiles in Virgin Beauty drest  Receiv'd his Passion and return'd his Love  And softly woo'd him to the silent Grove  Enclos'd in deepest Shades of full∣grown Wood  Within the Grove a spacious Grotto stood  Where forty Youths in Marble seem'd to mourn  Each Youth reclining on a fun'ral Urn  Thither the Nymph directs the Monarch's Way  He treads her Footsteps joyful to obey  There fir'd with Passion clasp'd her to his Breast  And thus the Transport of his Soul confess'd  Delightful Beauty deck'd with ev'ry Charm  High Fancy paints or glowing Love can form  I sigh I gaze I tremble I adore  Such lovely Looks ne'er blest my Sight before  Here under covert of th' imbow'ring Shade  For Love's Delights and tender Transports made  No busy Eye our Raptures to detect  No envious Tongue to censure or direct  Here yield to Love and tenderly employ  The silent Season in extatic Joy  With Arms enclos'd his Treasure to retain  He sigh'd and woo'd but woo'd and sigh'd in vain  She rush'd indignant from his fond Embrace  While Rage with Blushes paints her Virgin Face  Yet still he sues with suppliant Hands and Eyes  While she to Magic Charms for Vengeance flies  A limpid Fountain murmur'd thro' the Cave  She fill'd her Palm with the translucent Wave  And sprinkling cry'd Receive false Man in Time  The just Reward of thy detested Crime  Thy changeful Sex in Perfidy delight  Despise Perfection and fair Virtue slight  False fickle base tyrannic and unkind  Whose Hearts nor Vows can chain nor Honour bind  Mad to possess by Passion blindly led  And then as mad to stain the nuptial Bed  Whose roving Souls no Excellence no Age  No Form no Rank no Beauty can en∣gage  Slaves to the Bad to the Deserving worst  Sick of your twentieth Love as of your first  The Statues which this hallow'd Grot adorn  Like thee were Lovers and like thee for∣sworn  Whose faithless Hearts no Kindness could secure  Nor for a Day preserve their Passion pure  Whom neither Love nor Beauty could restrain  Nor Fear of endless Infamy and Pain  In me behold thy Queen for know with Ease  We Deities assume each Form we please  Nor can the feeble Ken of mortal Eyes  Perceive the Goddess thro' the dark Dis∣guise  Now feel the Force of Heav'n's avenging Hand  And here inanimate for ever stand  She spokeAmaz'd the list'ning Mo∣narch stood  And icy Horror froze his ebbing Blood  Thick Shades of Death upon his Eyelids creep  And clos'd them fast in everlasting Sleep  No Sense of Life no Motion he retains  But fix'd a dreadful Monument remains  A STATUE now and if reviv'd once more  Would prove no doubt as perjur'd as before  I doubt not but the World will expect to hear from me some of the Dean's A∣mours as he has not quite escaped Censure on account of his Gallantries but here I am not able to oblige my Reader he be∣ing too far advanced in Years when I first had the honour of being known to him for Amusements of that kind I make no doubt but he has often been the Object of Love and his  Cadenus  and  Vanessa  seem to assure us that he was the Favourite of one Lady but to speak my Sentiments I really believe it was a Passion he was whol∣ly unacquainted with and which he would have thought it beneath the Dignity of his Wisdom to entertain Not that I ever imagined he was an Enemy to the Fair for when he found them docile he took great pleasure to instruct them And if I have any Merit as a Writer I must gratefully acknowledge it due to the pains he took to teach me to think and speak with Propriety tho' to tell the Truth he was a very rough sort of a Tutor for one of my Years and Sex for whenever  I made use of an inelegant Phrase I was sure of a deadly Pinch and frequently re∣ceived Chastisement before I knew my Crime However I am convinced had he thought me incorrigibly dull I should have escaped without Correction and the black and blue Favours I received at his Hands were meant for Merit tho' be∣stowed on me Yet tho' to my Shame I own it I was fond of Admiration to a Fault and a little too much upon the Co∣quette for a married Woman I would at any Time give up any Pleasure or Gai∣ty for the more rationaln Etertainment of the Dean's Conversation  Five Years rolled insensibly away in a Kind of tolerable Happiness as Lady  Town∣ly  terms it but that it seems I was not much longer to enjoy However before I begin to speak of Offence and Trouble I shall endeavour to enliven my Narration with all the little amusing Incidents I can possibly recollect  The following Trifle as it was produc∣tive of a handsome Letter to me from the Dean and of more Honour than I could  possibly expect from it my Vanity will not let me omit My Brother teized me one Evening to write some Verse as a School Exercise for him I asked him what I should write upon Why said he pertly what should you write upon but the Paper So taking it for my Subject I wrote the fol∣lowing Lines  O spotless Paper fair and white  On whom by Force constrain'd I write  How cruel am I to destroy  Thy Purity to please a Boy  Ungrateful I thus to abuse  The fairest Servant of the Muse  Dear Friend to whom I oft impart  The choicest Secrets of my Heart  Ah what Atonement can be made  For spotless Innocence betray'd  How fair how lovely didst thou shew  Like lilly'd Banks or falling Snow  But now alas become my Prey  No Floods can wash thy Stains away  Yet this small Comfort I can give  That which destroy'd shall make thee live  As the Lines did not suit my Brother's Purpose they lay carelessly on the Table when a Lady of Distinction who was going to  England  came to take her leave of us She would examine what I had been scrib∣bling and seemed so well pleased with my Rhymes that she did them the Honour to put them in her PocketBook and I never thought more of them  About four Years after this making a Visit to Baron  Wainwright  's Lady she told me she had got a very pretty Poem from  London  wrote by the Lord Chancellor  Tal∣bot  's Daughter a young Lady of but twelve Years of Age and desired I would read them for the Good of the Company but how great was my Surprize to find they were the above Lines however I went through my Task and Mrs  Wainwright  asked my Opinion of them and seemed impatient at my Silence I told her the young Lady must have wrote them at least four Years before because I had seen them so long ago Upon which the Baron said that he also remembered them and that he was told by the Person he saw them with  that they were writ by a very young Girl who was married to a Clergyman in  Ire∣land  My smiling made them guess at the Person and at the same Time excused me for being not over forward to praise them When I returned home I found a Letter from Mr  Pn  who was in  London  with a News Paper inclosed wherein the above Poem was printed I related this to the Dean who ordered me to send the Lines to him The next Morning a Lady came to visit me who told me it being the Dean's BirthDay he had received a Book very richly bound and clasped with Gold from the Earl of  Orrery  with a handsome Poem wrote by himself to the Dean in the first Page the rest being blank and that Dr  Delany  had sent him a silver Standish with a complimentary Poem  'Why then said I as the Dean is furnished with Paper and Ink it is the least I can do to send him a Pen'  so having a fine Eagle's Quill I wrapt it into the following Lines and sent it to the Dean and also the Bit of a News Paper  wherein the Lines on PAPER were printed in  London  Sent with a  QUILL  to Dr  SWIFT  upon hearing he had received a  BOOK  and a  STANDISH  SHALL then my Kindred all my Glory claim  And boldly rob me of eternal Fame  To ev'ry Art my gen'rous Aid I lend  To Music Painting Poetry a Friend  'Tis I celestial Harmony inspire  Quills of the Harpsichord  When fix'd to strike the sweetly warbling Wire  I to the faithful Canvas have consign'd  Each bright Idea of the Painter's Mind  Behold from  Raphael  's skydipt Pencils rise  Such heav'nly Scenes as charm the Gazers Eyes  O let me now aspire to higher Praise  Ambitious to transcribe your deathless Lays  Nor thou immortal Bard my Aid refuse  Accept me as the Servant of your Muse  Then shall the World my wondrous Worth declare  And all Mankind your matchless Pen revere  On  NewYear'sDay  I received from the Dean the following Letter  DeaneryHouse  Jan  Madam  I Send you your Bit of a Newspaper with the Verses than which I never saw better in their Kind I have the same Opinion of those you were pleased to write upon me as have also some particular Friends of Genius and Taste to whom I ventured to communicate them who uni∣versally agree with me But as I cannot with Decency shew them except to a very few I hope for both our Sakes others will do it for me I can only assure you I value your Present as much as either of the others only you must permit it to be turned into a Pen which Office I will  perform with my own Hand and never permit any other to use it I heartily wish you many happy New Years and am with true Esteem  Madam  Your most obliged Friend and Servant J SWIFT  But as I have mentioned Mr  Pn  's being in  London  I ought also to inform my Reader what Inducement he had to quit his Family for a whole Year which was as fol∣lows Dr  Swift  had in Queen  Anne  's Reign been the first Promoter of Alderman  Barber  who afterwards by many lucky Ac∣cidents rose to be Lord Mayor of  London  which Station he filled with distinguished Abilities and retained so grateful a Sense of the Dean's Fa  ur to him that he made him the Compliment of nominating a Chap∣lain to him the Dean offered this Honour to Mr  Pn  who gladly accepted of  it and came home in high Spirits to ac∣quaint me with his Preferment but what∣ever Joy it brought to him I was quite sunk in Sorrow at the Thoughts of parting for so long a Time with one I so dearly loved All his Friends were against his going and the late Primate Dr  Hoadly  then Archbishop of  Dublin  remonstrated to him that serving under a Person so re∣markably disaffected as the Alderman might very probably prejudice him in the Eyes of the Government but all in vain Mr  Pn  was ever rash obstinate and selfwilled and should I add treacherous cruel and ungrateful I should not wrong the Truth but however unwilling I am to speak harshly of the Husband of my Youth and the Father of my Children I must draw his Character wherein I will  Nothing extenuate  Nor set down aught in Malice  Othello  That he is both a Scholar and a Man of Genius all who know him must allow but like Mr  Pope  he is so plagued with Envy  that he even hated me because I could write and took an invincible Aversion to Coun∣sellor  Smith  because he excelled him on the Harpsichord It happened one Evening that this Gentleman sung and played to us the Oratorio of Queen  Esther  unfortunate∣ly for me I was so charmed with it that at the Conclusion of the Music I wrote the following Lines  To  JOHN SMITH  Esq  MUSIC once more her antient Pow'r displays  Resistless now as in  Timotheus  ' Days  Our varied Passions change at thy Com∣mand  Our correspondent Hearts obey thy Hand  Who can untouch'd attend the awful Sound  When swelling Notes proclaim  Jehovah  crown'd  Borne on the hallow'd Strains our Souls arise  Till Heav'n seems present to our ravish'd Eyes  When to its Source thy Soul shall wing its Flight  And with eternal Harmony unite  Thy skilful Hand shall heav'nly Joys im∣prove  And add new Rapture to the Bliss above  As the Lines were wrote offhand as to say the Truth every Thing of mine is for I am too volatile to revise or correct any thing I write Mr  Smith  complimented Mr  Pn  on having a Wife who could write better than himself he supposing Mr  Pn  to be so much the Lover that he would be delighted with my Praise and join in it But lackaday he little knew what I was to suffer for the Superiority of Genius he was pleased to ascribe to me I then was continually told with a contemp∣tuous jibing Air O my Dear a Lady of your Accomplishments why Mr  Smith  says you write better than I and to be sure he is a great Judge But another unlucky Accident likewise happened How fatal to me has Praise been We supped at the  Dean's and I had been reading out by his Command some of his prosaic Work he was pleased to say I acquitted myself so well that I should have a Glass of his best Wine and sent Mr  Pn  to the Cellar for it The Dean in the mean Time said to me  'I would have every Man write his own  English  '  'To be sure Sir said I that would be best'  'Ay to be sure Sir you give me an Answer and Px take you I am sure you do not under∣stand my Meaning'  'Very possible Sir but I certainly understand my own when I have any'  'Well then what do you understand by writing one's own  Eng∣lish  '  'Why really Sir not to confine one's self to a Set of Phrases as some of our antient  English  Historians  Camden  in particular seems to have done but to make use of such Words as naturally oc∣cur on the Subject'  'Hush says he your Husband is coming I will put the same Question to him'  He did so and Mr  Pn  answered  'To be sure a Man ought to write good  English  '  'Nay but his own  English  I say his own  what do you understand by that'  'Why Sir said he what should I un∣derstand'  'Px on you for a Dunce said he were your Wife and you to sit for a Fellowship I would give her one sooner than admit you a Sizar'  And now my Business was compleatly done Mr  Pn  viewed me with scornful yet with jealous Eyes And tho' I never presumed to vye with him for Pre∣eminence well knowing he not only surpas∣sed me in natural Talents but also had the Advantage of having those Talents im∣proved by Learning and was sensible the Compliments I received were rather paid to me as a Woman in whom any thing a Degree above Ignorance appears surpriz∣ing than to any Merit I really possessed he thought proper to insult me every Mo∣ment Indeed he did not beat me which some of the goodnatured Ladies have brought as an Argument that he was an ex∣cellent Husband but how a Clergyman should strike a Wife who never contra∣dicted him and who was the most remark∣ably gentle even of her own soft Sex I  know not Besides I had then a dear and honoured Father to protect me I am sure I may say with  Ophelia  My Violets all wither'd when he dy'd  Then was I left defenceless to all the In∣juries my Husband's subtle Cruelty could devise against open unsuspecting Innocence  Another trivial Accident also offended my Husband He was one Winter's Eve∣ning reading  Horace  and said he would engage to write an Ode exactly in his Man∣ner so he directly set about it The Fan∣cy came into my Head to write one also though I understood not a Word of  Latin  nor knew no more of the Poet than from the  English  Translations My Lines were as follow  An  ODE  I Envy not the Proud their Wealth  Their Equipage and State  Give me but Innocence and Health  I ask not to be great  I in this sweet Retirement find  A Joy unknown to Kings  For Scepters to a virtuous Mind  Seem vain and empty Things  Great  Cincinnatus  at his Plough  With brighter Lustre shone  Than guilty  Caesar  e'er cou'd shew  Tho' seated on a Throne  Tumultuous Days and restless Nights  Ambition ever knows  A Stranger to the calm Delights  Of Study and Repose  Then free from Envy Care and Strife  Keep me ye Powers divine  And pleas'd when ye demand my Life  May I that Life resign  As I had finished my Task first I shewed it to Mr  Pn  who contrary to my Expectation for I imagined he would be pleased was very angry and told me the Dean had made me mad that the Lines were Nonsense and that a Needle became  a Woman's Hand better than a Pen and Ink So to bring him into Temper I praised his Ode highly and threw my own into the Fire And here let me seriously advise every Lady who has the Misfortune to be poetically turned never to marry a Poet but remember  Swift  's Lines  What Poet wou'd not grieve to see  His Friends cou'd write as well as he  And rather than be thus outdone  He'd hang them every Mother's Son  Her End when Emulation misses  She turns to Envy Stings and Hisses  The strongest Friendship yields to Pride  Unless the Odds be on our Side  And if a Man cannot bear his Friend should write much less can he endure it in his Wife it seems to set them too much upon a Level with their Lords and Masters and this I take to be the true Reason why even Men of Sense discountenance Learning in Women and commonly chuse for Mates the most illiterate and stupid of the Sex and  then bless their Stars their Wife is not a Wit  But if a Remark be true which I have somewhere read that  a foolish Woman never brought forth a wise Son  I think the Gentle∣men should have some Regard to the Intel∣lects of those they espouse  But to return from this long tho' necessa∣ry Digression and take things a little more in their Order Mr  Pn  contrary to every body's Advice who had any Re∣gard for him went for  England  I was very desirous of going with him but he told me plainly he did not want such an In∣cumbrance as a Wife and that he did not intend to pass there for a married Man and that in short he could not taste any Pleasure where I was As this was a Secret I did not know before I received it with Asto∣nishment for amidst all his  wayward Moods  I ever imagined till then that he loved me and that the many ill natured Speeches he made me were rather the Effect of a bad Temper than any settled Aversion he had taken against me especially as I observed he treated every body with Con∣tempt  even Persons every Way superior to him the Dean alone excepted to whom he paid even a servile Complaisance And tho' he now fairly plucked off the Mask and let me see my Mistake I could hardly give him Credit so unwilling are we to believe Truth when it runs counter to our Wishes  The next Day he went on board the Yacht in Company with Mr  Edward Walpole  to whom he was recommended by a Man of Quality since dead and left me and my three Children almost without an Adieu So eagerly did he seek his own Destruction  I am hardly able to describe the various Emotions with which my Heart was agitated on his Departure Love Grief and Re∣sentment for his last Speech by Turns possessed it However I received a very kind Letter from him from  Chester  which made me a little easy and as my Friends seldom permitted me to be alone I did not give much way to Melancholy  I believe it will be expected from the general Reflections I have thrown out a∣gainst the Clergy that I should descend to  Particulars and expose by Name the Guilty but this invidious Task I must decline Be∣sides as  Angelo  says in  Measure for Mea∣sure  when he is tempting a Virgin and she threatens to expose him  Who will believe thee  Isabel  My unsoil'd Name th' Austereness of my Life  My Interest in the State may vouch against you  That you shall stifle in your own Report  And smell of Calumny  Besides I should arm a formidable Body against me who would not fail sooner or later to take ample Vengeance  As unfor∣giving as a Churchman  is become prover∣bial so as I am a Sort of a Priestess I will like a faithful MotherConfessor keep the Secrets of my ghostly Brethren  I have another Inducement to Silence not I must own quite so goodnatured which is that I have a malignant Pleasure in keeping those in Awe who awe all the World beside which I should lose the Mo∣ment  I had done my worst I remember a certain Gentleman who happening to be guilty of a venial Transgression with a mean Woman it unluckily manifested itself The Gentleman was young and had a very severe Father who gave him but a scanty Allowance all of which did not satisfy the mercenary Wretch of a Woman who hop∣ing to gain more went and told her Story to his Father the Consequence of which was that she never afterwards had a Shil∣ling from either  The dullest Genius cannot fail  To take the Moral of the Tale  So let the stricken Deer go weep  The Hart ungall'd go play  The Innocent cannot take Offence and for the Guilty I will for the present with the charitable Ghost in  Hamlet  Leave them to Heav'n  And to the Thorn that in their Bosoms lodge  To prick and goad them there  But once more to gather up my Clue I received so passionately tender a Letter from  London  from Mr  Pn  that I quite forgot all his Unkindness and sit∣ting down to answer it without the least Intention of Rhyming the following Lines flowed from my Pen  These Lines dear Partner of my Life  Come from a tender faithful Wife  Happy when you her Thoughts approve  Supremely happy in your Love  O may the blissful Flame endure  Uninjur'd lasting bright and pure  Thus far in Verse but can the Muse  Descend so low as telling News  Or can I easily in Rhime  Inform you how I pass my Time  To sooth my Woe and banish Care  I to the Theatre repair  Where charm'd with  Shakespear  's lofty Scenes  And pure inimitable Strains  My Rapture rais'd so high appears  It seeks to hide itself in Tears  On  Tuesday  last all Day I stray'd  In  Delville  's sweet inspiring Shade  There all was easy gay polite  The Weather and the Guests were bright  My lov'd  Constantia  there appear'd  And  Southern  long for Wit rever'd  Who like the hoary  Pylian  Sage  Excels in Wisdom as in Age  'Tis thus your Absence I beguile  And try to make Misfortune smile  But never can my constant Mind  A real Pleasure hope or find  Till Heav'n indulgently once more  My  Colin  to my Eyes restore  P S  Permit me here e'er I conclude  To pay a Debt of Gratitude  To  Worsdale  your ingenious Friend  My Praises and my Thanks commend  Yet all are far beneath his Due  Who sends me  My Husband's Picture  what resembles you  The Dean had given Mr  Pn  Let∣ters of Recommendation to several eminent Persons in  England  and amongst the rest one to Mr  Pope  who no sooner received it but he invited Mr  Pn  to pass a Fortnight with him at  Twickenham  he not being yet entered on his Office of Chaplain I received from him from thence a Letter filled with Mr  Pope  's Praises and the ex∣traordinary Regard he shewed him intro∣ducing him to several Noblemen and even oppressing him with Civilities which he modestly attributed to Mr  Pope  's Respect for the Dean and handsomely acknowledg∣ed the Obligation As I thought this a very proper Letter to communicate I went directly with it to the Deanery The Dean read it over with a fix'd Attention and re∣turning it to me he told me he had by the same Pacquet received a Letter from Mr  Pope  which with somewhat of a stern Brow he put into my Hand and walked  out into the Garden I was so startled at his Austerity that I was for some Minutes unable to open it and when I did the Con∣tents greatly astonished me The Substance of it was that he had in pure Complai∣sance to the Dean entertained Mr  Pn  but that he was surprised he should be so mistaken to recommend him as a modest ingenious Man who was a most forward shallow conceited Fellow That in the Hope of having an agreeable Companion he had invited him to pass a Fortnight with him which he heartily repented being sick of his Impertinence before the End of the third Day and a great deal more much to the same Purpose By the time I had read it thro' the Dean returned and asked me what I thought of it I told him I was sure Mr  Pn  did not deserve the Character Mr  Pope  had given of him and that he was highly ungenerous to caress and abuse him at the same time Upon this the Dean lost all Patience and flew into such a Rage that he quite terrified me he asked me Why I did not swear that my Husband was six Foot high And Did I  think myself a better Judge than Mr  Pope  or Did I presume to give him the Lie and a thousand other Extravagancies As I durst not venture to speak a Word more my Heart swelled so that I burst into Tears which he attributing to Pride and Resent∣ment made him if possible ten times more angry and I am not sure he would not have beat me but that fortunately for me a Gentleman came to visit him As I was in a violent Passion of Tears the Dean did not bring him into the Room where I was but went to receive him in another and I gladly laid hold of that opportunity of making my escape from his Wrath  The next Morning early I wrote him a Letter expressive of the Anxiety I was un∣der lest I had any way offended him and assured him which was Truth my Tears did not flow from Pride but from the Ap∣prehension I had that Mr  Pope  might in∣fluence him to withdraw his Favour from us I added on my own Part that even if I was partial to Mr  Pn  I hoped it was the most pardonable Error a Wife could be guilty of and concluded with begging if  he had any Regard for my Peace he would honour me with an Answer By the Re∣turn of the Messenger I received the fol∣lowing Lines  Madam  YOU must shake off the Leavings of your Sex If you cannot keep a Secret and take a Chiding you will quick∣ly be out of my Sphere Corrigible Peo∣ple are to be chid those who are other∣wise may be very safe from any Lectures of mine I should rather chuse to indulge them in their Follies than attempt to set them right I desire you may not inform your Husband of what has passed for a Reason I shall give you when I see you which may be this Evening if you will I am very sincerely  Your Friend J SWIFT  Accordingly I waited on the Dean about five o'Clock in the Evening an Hour I knew he would be free from Company He received me with great Kindness and told me he would write a Letter of Ad∣vice to Mr  Pn    'But said he should you acquaint him with this Letter of  Pope  's he might perhaps resent it to him and make him an Enemy'  How kind how considerate was this The Dean then shewed me the Poem he wrote on his own Death when I came to that Part of it  Behold the fatal Day arrive  How is the Dean He's just alive  I was so sensibly affected that my Eyes filled with Tears The Dean observing it said  'Phoo I am not dead yetbut you shall not read any more now'  I then earnestly requested he would let me take it home with me which he did on certain Conditions which were that I should neither shew it to any body nor copy it and that I should send it to him  by Eight o'Clock the next Morning all which I punctually performed  But the Dean did not know what sort of a Memory I had when he intrusted me with his Verse I had no occasion for any other Copy than what I had registred in the  Book and Volume of my Brain  I could repeat the whole Poem and could not forbear delighting some particular Friends with a Rehearsal of it This reached the Dean's Ear who imagined I plaid him false and sent for me to come to him When I entered he told me I had broke my Word with him and consequently for∣feited all the good Opinion he had ever conceived of me I looked as I think he generally made me do like a Fool I asked what I had done He told me I had copied his Poem and shewn it round the Town I assured him I had not He said I lyed and produced a Poem some∣thing like it published in  London  and told me from reading it about that odd Bur∣lesque on it had taken rise He bade me read it aloud I did so and could not forbear laughing as I plainly perceived  tho' he had endeavoured to disguise his Stile that the Dean had burlesqued himself and made no manner of scruple to tell him so He pretended to be very angry asked me did I ever know him write Triplets and told me I had neither Taste nor Judgment and knew no more of Poetry than a Horse I told him I would confess it provided he would seriously give me his Word he did not write that Poem He said Px take me for a Dunce I then assured him I did not copy his Poem but added when I read any thing peculiar∣ly charming I never forgot it and that I could repeat not only all his Works but all  Shakespear  's which I put to this Trial I desired him to open any Part of it and read a Line and I would engage to go on with the whole Speech as we were in his Library he directly made the Experiment The Line he first gave me he had pur∣posely picked out for its singular Oddness  But rancours in the Vessel of my Peace  Macbeth  I readily went on with the whole Speech and did so several times that he tried me with different Plays The Dean then took down  Hudibras  and ordered me to examine him in it as he had done me in  Shakespear  and to my great Surprize I found he re∣membered every Line from Beginning to End of it I say it surprized me because I had been misled by Mr  Pope  's Remark  That where Beams of warm Imagination play  The Memory's soft Figures melt away  Essay on Criticism  To think Wit and Memory incompatible things I told the Dean he had convinced me the old Proverb was false and indeed I know not how any Person can be witty without a good Memory When I returned home I found I had not been mistaken in the Opinion I had conceived that the Dean had burlesqued his own Poem I had a Confirmation of it in a Letter from Mr  Pn  to whom he had sent it to have it printed in  London  My Evening's Chat with the Dean fur∣nished me with Matter of Speculation on that most amazing Faculty of the human Mind Memory which according to my usual Custom I threw into Rhime and hope it will not be displeasing to my Reader  MEMORY a POEM  IN what Recesses of the Brain  Does this amazing Pow'r remain  By which all Knowledge we attain  What art thou Memory What Tongue can tell  What curious Artist trace thy hidden Cell  Wherein ten thousand diff'rent Objects dwell  Surprising Storehouse in whose narrow Womb  All Things the past the present and to come  Find ample Space and large and mighty Room  O falsely deem'd the Foe of sacred Wit  Thou who the Nurse and Guardian art of it  Laying it up till Season due and fit  Then proud the wond'rous Treasure to produce  As Understanding points it to conduce  Either to Entertainment or to Use  Nor Love nor holy Friendship without thee  Could ever of the least Duration be  Nor Gratitude nor Truth nor Piety  Where thou art not the chearless human Mind  Is one vast Void all darksome sad and blind  No Trace of any thing remains behind  The sacred Stores of Learning all are thine  'Tis only thou record'st the faithful Line  'Tis thou mak'st Humankind almost divine  And when at length we quit this mortal Scene  Thou still shalt with our tender Friends remain  And Time and Death shall strike at thee in vain  Lord let me so this wond'rous Gift em∣ploy  It may a Fountain be of endless Joy  Which Time nor Accident may ne'er destroy  Still let my faithful Memory impart  And deep engrave it on my grateful Heart  How just and good and excellent thou art  My Reader may now plainly perceive I was most incorrigibly devoted to Versifying and all my Spouse's wholesome Admoni∣tions had no manner of Effect on me In short I believe this scribbling Itch is an in∣curable Disease for tho'  Horace  says  See his Art of Poetry  taking some Physic in the Spring rid him  of it yet as he even relates this in flowing Numbers we have no Cause to give him Credit He also declares all Poets are visibly possessed and mad  Shakespear  seems to be of the same opinion tho' he describes it with greater Elegance than even  Horace  has done at least in the Translation  The Poet's Eye in a fine Frenzy rolling  Doth glance from Heav'n to Earth from Earth to Heav'n  And as Imagination bodies forth  The Forms of Things unknown the Poet's Pen  Turns them to Shapes and gives to airy Nothing  A local Habitation and a Name  The Truth of which he has fully verified giving us in his divine Works a new Crea∣tion of his own with a new Language also peculiar to the different Species and Orders of Beings he introduces to us  Milton  had studied him with Care and like the Bee committed many sweet Thefts on his im∣mortal Blooms Whoever reads the Part  of the Fairies in the  Midsummer Night's Dream  may easily perceive how many beautiful Images  Milton  has borrowed thence to adorn his Masque of  Comus  And really I think as  Shakespear  had plun∣dered all Art and Nature the visible and invisible World it was but just to make Reprizals and steal from his rich Store  I hope my Reader will pardon me for so often running away from  myself  I can∣not say I am  Egotist  enough to be much enamoured of such an unhappy Theme and have often wished I could do it in rea∣lity for I have been plunged in such Ca∣lamity that I have even thought it impos∣sible to be true and vainly hoped to wake as from some hideous Dream to find a better Fate  And as one travelling in a barren Waste could not be displeased to be sometimes led out of the direct Road to view a more a∣greeable Prospect I deal thus with my Readers and turn them from the gloomy Vale of my Life to relieve them with something more pleasing  To amuse myself  d indeed with no other View I wrote in my Husband's Ab∣sence all the following Poems which if they should not happen also to amuse my Readers they are at their own Liberty and may turn

and sent it to my Husband notwithstand∣ing his former Lectures  The Seventh Ode of the Third Book of  HO∣RACE  paraphrased  Quid fles Asterie  ASTERIA  why will you consume  In Sighs and Tears your rosy Bloom  No more your youthful Husband mourn  He soon shall to your Arms return  Propitious Winds shall waft him o'er  Enrich'd from  Britain  's fruitful Shore  In vain the Nymphs display their Charms  To win him to their longing Arms  Tho' strong Temptations court the Youth  Doubt not his Constancy and Truth  They fix'd as Rocks unmov'd remain  While Winds and Waves assault in vain  You only teach his Soul to know  The secret Pang the tender Woe  For you he feels a thousand Fears  And oft bedews his Couch with Tears  Ah then in kind Return beware  Lest tempting Words your Heart ensnare  Avoid the Dusk and silent Shade  Nor heed the plaintive Serenade  Let Prudence that unerring Guide  O'er ev'ry Thought and Act preside  So shall your Faith and Virtue prove  Worthy his matchless Truth and Love  Mr  Pn  who loved me best at a Distance wrote me a very kind Letter wherein he told me my Verses were like myself full of Elegance and Beauty that Mr  Pope  and others whom he had shewn them to longed to see the Writer and that he heartily wished me in  London  And this put the Fancy into my Head of going there and as some of my Acquaintance intended for it with whom I thought I could agreeably travel I soon resolved to accompany them  Mr  Pn  had been absent nine Months a tedious Time in a Lover's Reckoning In three Months Time his Office expired for every new Lord Mayor of  London  has a new Chaplain so I thought I should have the Pleasure of passing the Winter in  London  and then if nothing bet∣ter  offered we should return home toge∣ther  London  has very attractive Charms for most People as our  Irish  Nobility and Gentry sufficiently evidence by spending the greatest Part of their Time and Fortune there and can it be wondered at that a young lively Woman should be fond of taking the only Opportunity she might ever have of seeing its Magnificence in Perfec∣tion Well but how to execute my Pro∣ject for I was apprehensive if either my own Parents or Mr  Pn  's were ac∣quainted with it they would prevent me so I resolved to make but one Confidante which was a very faithful Servant who in the Evening put my Portmanteau aboard the Yacht Next Morning the Wind being fair I went under Pretence of seeing my Friends safe aboard down the River with them and into the Ship as it were out of Curiosity but being then out of Dan∣ger of Pursuit I told them my Intention which some approved of and some blamed  However as I did not question a kind Re¦ception from my Husband and knew my Children would be well taken care of by m  Parents I was very chearful and easy and little regarded what was thought of my Frolick neither could I divine that any evil Construction would be put upon it  We had a very safe Passage and a plea∣sant Journey I wrote to Mr  Pn  from  Parkgate  and he and Mr  We  met me about four Miles Distance from  London  So I took leave of my FellowTravellers for the present and went into the Coach to them which drove to Mr  Wle  's Mr  Pn  received me very obligingly and called me his little Fu∣gitive and Runaway but a Stranger would have thought Mr  Wle  was my Hus∣band he welcomed me so kindly and paid me so many Compliments As I had been up at three o'Clock in the Morning I was heartily fatigued and desired Mr  Pn  to take leave but he whispered me to in∣vite Mr  Wle  home to Supper with us which accordingly I did and he was so transported with this Civility he could not conceal his Joy whatever I commended amongst his Paintings he would force me to accept of and putting as many Bottles  of Wine into the CoachBox as it would conveniently hold we went to Mr  Pn  's Lodging which I found very handsome and convenient Wine and good Chear enter∣tained us till Midnight to our mutual Satis∣factions  When Mr  Pn  and I were alone he told me that tho' he was very glad to see me he was afraid I would have but a lonely Time of it in  London  he being ob∣liged to attend on the Lord Mayor from Nine in the Morning till Six in the Eve∣ning and from thence he always went to the Play and afterwards to Supper to Mrs  Heron  one of the Actresses of no very good Fame Though I thought this but an odd Manner of Life for a Clergyman I did not say so being unwilling to offend him I had heard it whispered that he liked this Woman but I resolved patient∣ly to wait the Event  The next Day when he was going out I put him in Mind that Mr  Wle  said he would pass the Evening with us but he laughed at my believing it and said he was a Man so uncertain in his Temper that per∣haps  I might never see him again while I lived Just then a Lady who came over with me called on us and Mr  Pn  and she had some private Chat When she was gone he told me she had brought him a Letter and some Poetry from the Dean which he had ordered him to dispose of and put the Money in his own Pocket as he could not stay to read them he took them with him to the Lord Mayor's  However Mr  Pn  was mistaken in imagining Mr  Wle  would fail in his Appointment he came and told me Mr  Pn  was at the Play but would sup with us He made use of his Absence to compliment me at an unmerciful Rate and sung me all the tenderest Love Songs he could think of in the most pathetic Manner In short he exerted his Talents to entertain me and behaved himself so much in the Stile of a Lover that had I not been married I should have imagined he intended to address me When Mr  Pn  returned he told him he was certainly the happiest Man living and won∣dered how he could be a Moment out of  my Company where he could stay for ever Mr  Pn  seemed much pleased with his Gallantry and said he hoped I would induce him to see us often When we were alone he told me he believed his Friend was in love with me I answered if he thought so I wondered he gave him so warm an Invitation He said he was a very generous Man and that his liking to me if well managed might prove very profitable for he valued no Expence where a Lady was in the Case So it seems I was to be the Bait wherewith he was to angle for Gold out of a Rival's Pocket A Scheme which had a twofold Prospect of Gain annexed to it for while a Lover has Hope he seldom quits the Chace and will even thank the Husband for taking the friendly Freedom of using his Purse and yet should the Gallant be detected in taking any friendly Freedoms with the Wife in return the Law is all against him Da∣mages and Imprisonment must ensue Which Consideration may serve as a Warn∣ing to all Men not to invade Properties or commit wilful Trespass on their Neigh∣bour's Ground  If my Readers are by this Time the least acquainted with my Spirit they may judge I looked on this Project with the Contempt it deserved however I promised Complaisance which indeed Mr  Wle  's seeming Merits might well deserve The next Day I was invited to the Lord Mayor's who on account of the resolute Opposition he had given to the Excise Act was the Darling of the People He was but indiffe∣rent as to his Person or rather homely than otherwise but he had an excellent Under∣standing and the Liveliness of his Genius shone in his Eyes which were very black and sparkling He always treated me with great Complaisance and gave me a general Invitation to his Table As the Lord Mayor was a Batchelor he had a Gentle∣woman who managed his Houshold Af∣fairs and who except on public Days did the Honours of his Table Mr  Pn  told me she was violently in love with him and was ready to run mad upon hearing I was come to  London  How true this might be I know not but as she was very civil to me and was old enough to  be my Mother I was not the least disturb∣ed with Jealousy on her own Account tho' I can't help saying she gave me a great deal of Uneasiness by relating to me many Instances of my Husband's extraor∣dinary Regard for the Player aforemen∣tioned We went together to the Play on Purpose to see her and to do her Justice she was a graceful fine Woman at least she appeared such on the Stage and had a peculiar Skill in dressing to Advantage Mr  Pn  and Mr  Wle  were at the Play they met us going out and Mr  Pn  committed me to the Care of his Friend who had a Coach waiting to convey me home but Mr  Pn  went to his old Rendezvous to the Actress to my very great Mortification because I really preferred his Conversation to any other in the World However he was so com∣plaisant he used every Evening to send Mr  Wle  to keep me Company while he pursued his Pleasures and as I shall an∣swer it to Heaven he did every thing in his power to forward and encourage an Amour between his Friend and me  One Instance out of an hundred I could produce I submit to the impartial Judgment of my Reader One of the young Ladies at whose House I first saw Mr  Pn  happening to be in  London  and but in low Circumstances came to visit me she in∣sisted on my passing the next Evening with her and just as I was going Mr  Wle  came in and offered to accompany me to which I gladly consented hoping as he was then a Man of Interest he might recom∣mend her to some good Family as a Go∣verness to Children or a Lady's Woman when he knew how well qualified she was for either Place As her Spirit was far a∣bove her Ability I was concerned to see what Expence she had put herself to for my Reception having provided a very genteel Supper to which she would oblige us to stay While she was giving Orders for it I informed Mr  Wle  of her Distress who immediately gave me a Gui∣nea for her but entreated I would give it to her as Present from my self which as I knew it was the only Method to make her accept of it I did  When I came home I related to Mr  Pn  Mr  Wle  's obliging and ge∣nerous Behaviour but little was he pleased with the Recital What could I think of him when he told me I did very ill to in∣troduce a new Woman to him  i e  Mr  Wle  and that he hoped I would lose him and that henceforth he would bestow his Favours on her A Speech more pro∣per for the Mouth of one of those aban∣doned Wretches who live by the Sale of the Innocent than for a Husband a Gen∣tleman and one who ought to be a Chris∣tian But I believe he was of Opinion that  Let the malicious World say what it please  The fair Wife makes her Husband live at ease  And provided he sold me well and  put Money in his Purse  little regarded either my temporal or eternal Happiness  Another Instance either of his extraor∣dinary Confidence in my Fidelity to him or rather Indifference about it was that  he obliged me to go alone with his Friend to  Windsor  though as it was Winter there was no Possibility of going there and returning the same Day it being twenty Miles distant from  London  so that we had not only two Days but a Night also to pass together Could any Husband be more obliging to his Rival than to give him such an Opportunity to accomplish his Wishes Had mine but concurred I had then been undone for truly the Gentleman tried eve∣ry Argument to win me to them but in vain My Husband's Misconduct in expos∣ing me to such Temptation stung me to the Quick nay I could not help believ∣ing they were both in a Plot to betray me to Ruin and as we were at the top Inn in the Town I started at every Noise of Horsemen who stopped there and con∣cluded though falsly I believe that Mr  Wle  had given Mr  Pn  a Di∣rection where to find us and as this Ima∣ginatlion wholly possessed me I little re∣garded either the Elegance of our Enter∣tainment or the Tenderness and Passion the Gentleman expressed in every Word  and Look His soft Endearments were all lost on one who regarded him as an Enemy I was obstinately sullen and pretended Wea∣riness on purpose to quit his Company but I lost all Patience when calling to the Maid to shew me to my Chamber I found there was but one nay and but one Bed too provided for two Guests for it seems my Gentleman had so ordered it hoping no doubt to supply my Husband's Place  I was now in a manner convinced there was Treachery intended against me and re∣proached my desiring Swain in such bitter Terms that he had no Way to prove his Innocence but by retiring tho' very re∣luctantly to another Apartment and I took special Care to barricade my own not only doublelocking it but also placing all the Chairs and Tables against the Door to prevent a Possibility of being surprized  I rose very early next Morning to take a Survey of what Curiosities  Windsor  afforded as it was too late the Night before to see any thing but found nothing worth Ob∣servation except the Castle whose emi∣nent Situation and  Gothick  Grandeur might  very well some Ages ago make it es∣teemed a  Nonpareil  But as it has frequent∣ly been described and celebrated I shall only say that considering it as the Palace of the  Edwards  and  Henrys  I was touched with something like a religious Veneration for it which no modern Building could inspire me with  Mr  Wle  attended me with great Respect and excepting that he tenderly re∣proached me with what he called my Cruel∣ty the Night before gave me no farther Cause of Displeasure but brought me safely home in his Chaise to Mr  Pn  But pray gentle Reader suppose it had happened otherwise that NightSolitude an agreeable and importunate Lover should have prevailed on human yielding Frailty whom could my Husband so properly have blamed for it as himself He who best knew our Frames bids us avoid Tempta∣tion as the surest Method nay and per∣haps the only one of avoiding Sin for who so firm that may not be seduced Why then should he Mr  Pn  drive me  into the Toils unless he meant to have me made a Prey of  I fairly confess this Action greatly sunk him in my Esteem nay it even did the same in Mr  Wle  's especially as he reaped no Satisfaction by it I could scarce∣ly after regard Mr  Pn  as a Hus∣band but rather as a Man whose Proper∣ty I was and who would gladly dispose of me to the best Bidder Shocking Thought  And yet this Scheme was so artfully ma∣naged as indeed all his against me have ever been that I could not well reproach him for it for he would have alledged it was a Party of Pleasure intended by him for my Health and Recreation and to have mentioned Mr  Wle  's Attempt why to say the Truth I looked upon it as a Thing which any Man in the same Circumstances might naturally be guilty of even tho' he had no previous liking to or Thought of the Woman So as there was no Harm done I judged it most prudent to be silent Besides no Faults are so ea∣sily pardoned by our Sex as those we be∣lieve to be occasioned by our own Charms  the eager Lover's constant Excuse and which our Vanity is but too apt to admit as a reasonable one  Of all Things in Nature I most wonder why Men should be severe in their Censures on our Sex for a Failure in Point of Chasti∣ty Is it not monstrous that our Seducers should be our Accusers Will they not em∣ploy Fraud nay often Force to gain us What various Arts what Stratagems what Wiles will they use for our Destruction but that once accomplished every oppro∣brious Term with which our Language so plentifully abounds shall be bestowed on us even by the very Villains who have wronged us  O Heav'n that such Companions thou'dst unfold  And put a Whip in ev'ry honest Hand  To lash such Rascals naked thro' the World  Even from the East to the West  I am sure the whole Female Sex will join with me in a hearty  Amen  Mr  Pn  's Year of Chaplainship being near expired I hoped that he would return to  I  eland  but he had entertained a Belief that Mr  Walpole  would provide for him and therefore determined to stay in  London  so I was forced to return single for as Mr  Pn  's Income ceased with his Office he chose to accept of an Offer from Mr  Wle  to lodge in his House For several Reasons I thought it most pro∣per to revisit my native Country the first and chief was the Affection I bore to my dear little ones the next to avoid both the Temptation and Scandal I must have suffered by going into the House of a Person who with regard to Women had an avowedly dissolute Character  But however cautiously and prudently I acted in this Affair it was not my good Fortune to escape Calumny so far from it that I was both traduced for going to  London  and for returning from it and the Wife of a certain B who invited me to dine with her a Day or two after my Return to  Dublin  when we retired to our Tea abused me in Language I should have  scorned in respect to my own Gentility to have given to the meanest Servant I was ever Mistress of And because my Hus∣band had made me a Present of a few little Trinkets all of which in the Expence amounted but to a Trifle told me she was sure some Gallant had given them to me But as I have since been informed she was ragingly jealous of me although without any Reason I can the more readi∣ly pardon her inhuman Treatment of me  But as I did not chuse to bear Re∣proaches I did not deserve I sent for a Chair and bursting into Tears left the Room In the Hall I met the B who was coming to drink Tea with the Ladies He was surprized to see me so disordered and tenderly laying hold of me enquired the Cause I desired he would ask his Lady who had invited me to use me ill Which he said he hoped she would not do even in Regard to my Condition being then pregnant But Heaven knows had he but considered how cruel all barren Creatures naturally are insomuch that I have seen a barren Ewe  attempt to kill a young Lamb he would rationally have judged what might have even in Law been my Protection was the very Cause of her Hatred and Displeasure to me  However as this Lady was the first to attack my Character I can do no less than return her these my public and grateful Acknowledgments for though perhaps half the World cannot tell whom I mean yet as it is more than probable the Person concerned may read over these Memoirs she at least will know her own Portrait  'Tis really a sad Misfortune that the honest Liberty of the Press is so suppressed in  Ireland  But however I promise all my Subscribe  s to oblige them with a Key to whatever Secrets I have been obliged to lock up and many I have been obliged to strike out of my Work otherwise I could never have had a single Line printed  Vice in Power will command at least an outward Homage and helpless Poverty dare not either oppose or expose it  A few Days after my Return to  Ireland  Sir  Daniel Molineux  said in  French  to my  Brother in St  Ann  's Church that he was surprised to see me look so chearful consi∣dering my Husband was in the  Bastile  My Bro  her told it to me but for my Life I could not guess what the Gentleman meant  But too soon I was informed by the NewsPapers that Mr  Pn  Mr  Motte  and Mr  Gilliver  were all taken up on account of some treasonable Poetry which Mr  Pn  had given to the two latter to print I then recollected the Papers afore∣mentioned delivered to him by one of my Female FellowTravellers  Who was the Informer I know not both Parties having violently accused each other but in my Soul I believe Mr  Pn  was innocent and I am sure I have no Rea∣son to be partial to him But certain it is his Character suffered so much that it al∣most broke my Heart as it deprived me of any Hopes even of his having Bread for his Family The Notion of his having betrayed Dr  Swift  incensed the whole Kingdom of  Ireland  against him and as I did not for many Weeks receive a Letter from him I knew not how to justify him  and when called upon by the late Primate Dr  Hoadly  to give him an Account of the Affair I could only answer him with Tears which as both he and his Lady were exceedingly humane pleaded his Cause as powerfully as the most moving Eloquence could have done his Grace bade me be comforted and write to my Hus∣band to come over and mind his Duty and he would still be a Friend to him and generously added that as many Per∣sons busied themselves in bringing Stories to him to Mr  Pn  's Disadvantage I should be welcome to his Table every Day which would discountenance those who endeavoured to prejudice him when they saw it did not make him or his Spouse withdraw their Regard from me  His Grace's Goodness affected me so much that my Tears of Sorrow were converted to those of Gratitude nor could I forbear falling on my Knees to pay my Acknowledgments to him and his friendly Lady for the Relief their Kindness had given to a Heart overcome with Anguish  At length I received a Letter from Mr  Pn  which he was obliged to in∣close to a Gentleman for me otherwise it would have been carried to the Castle and there examined so great Notice was taken of these Poems He wrote me word he had been ill of the Rheumatism and in great Trouble that he would directly return to  Ireland  but that he had not Money to bear his Expences I made an Application to my Father for him who bade me let the Fellow go to the  WestIndies  and he would take care of me and the Children But unfortunately for me I had too much Goodnature to take this wholesome Advice so far from it that I never ceased importuning him but fol∣lowed him from Morning till Night like  Niobe  all Tears till he give me a Bill of twenty Pounds to send to him with which he came over to  Ireland  but so pale and dejected that he looked like the Ghost of his former self and the Disregard he met with from every body went very near his Heart Every Day there was a new Abuse published on him my Father battled for  him and I did every thing in my power to chear and comfort his Spirits Com∣passion wrought now the same Effects on me as Love had done heretofore and as he frequently wept I could not forbear mingling my Tears with his and by way of Consolation wrote to him the follow∣ing Lines  NO more lov'd Partner of my Soul  At Disappointments grieve  Can flowing Tears our Fate control  Or Sighs our Woes relieve  Adversity is Virtue's School  To those who right discern  Let us observe each painful Rule  And each hard Lesson learn  When wintry Clouds obscure the Sky  And Heav'n and Earth deform  If fix'd the strong Foundations lie  The Castle braves the Storm  Thus fix'd on Faith's unfailing Rock  Let us endure a while  Misfortune's rude impetuous Shock  And glory in our Toil  Ill Fortune cannot always last  Or tho' it should remain  Yet we each painful Moment haste  A better World to gain  Where Calumny no more shall wound  Nor faithless Friends destroy  Where Innocence and Truth are crown'd  With neverfading Joy  I should not have dwelt so long on every trivial Circumstance had I not been strangely traduced about this Affair which as I shall answer it to God I have related with the utmost Truth and Exactness I never had any Breach with Mr  Pn  till our final Separation and I am sure if my Father had suspected me of any Dis∣honour he would sooner have joined with my Husband to prosecute me than have  given him a single Shilling to make up Matters between us  Neither can I really imagine what I had done to merit all the cruel and scandalous Aspersions thrown on me especially by the Ladies It would be infinite Vanity to sup∣pose Envy had any Share in their gentle Breasts or that the Praises I received from the other Sex on Account of my Writings awaked their Displeasure against me For though  They had no Title to aspire  Yet when I sunk they rose the high'r  But what I think most surprising is that Women who have suffered in their own Reputations are generally most cruel in their Censures on others I could men∣tion a Lady who was so fond of a cer∣tain Colonel that when he died she was almost mad though he was a married Man and yet she was heedful of the main Chance in prevailing on him to leave her his Estate from his Wife whose Brother's Estate she had before secured to  herself he being married to her I re∣member this Lady the whole Towntalk of  Dublin  and yet by having a large ill∣got Fortune she procured a second Hus∣band commenced Prude though not till Youth and Beauty were fled and is if she yet lives one of the bitterest Eenmies to any Woman who has ever committed even an Act of Indiscretion that can be found in the World as I have proved many Years ago by woful Experience  So  Flavia  full of inward Guilt  Calls  Florimel  an arrant Jilt  But enough of this When Mr  Pn  was once more settled in his Cure I being very much inclined to a Decay my Father said nothing would more effectually re∣store my Health than the Country so having often been invited to his Brother's at  Cork  I resolved on going there for a few Months where I was very kindly re∣ceived We took the Diversions of the Season at  Mallow  where nothing remark∣able happened to me except that one  Gentleman there took it into his Head to do what they there call blackguard me incessantly It was the reigning Humour of the Place amongst the young Folks to call Names sell Bargains and some∣times talk indecently all of which I ab∣horred and therefore this Gentleman singled me out as a Mark for this Sort of Wit and the more he found it vexed me the more he persisted in it At last I very seriously demanded of him what I had done to provoke him to teize me in the manner he did He said he heard I was a Wit and wished I would write a Satire on him So to oblige him I sent him the following Lines which obtained me a Truce from his antisublime Conceits  The  MIRROR  STREPHON  since my Skill you task  And so oft your

are at home  His Father Colonel  Murray  and his second Wife Lady  Blaney    And here gentle Reader I must bid you take leave of the Hope of any farther chearful Amusement here commences the  mournfullest Tale which ever yet was either told or read  The Winter's Return brought me to  Dublin  My Husband met me about a Mile from Town and took me and my Aunt  Van Lewen  's Sister who came to Town with me out of the StageCoach into a Hackney one He entertained me with an Account of a violent Quarrel he had with my Father and said he hoped if I had any Regard for him I would never go with inside his Doors This was a strange Command and as strange did it appear to me that he should quarrel with the best natured Gentleman in the World his Father in Effect as he treated him as his Son I told him I hoped he would excuse my once disobeying him for I owed if possible a superior Duty to my Father than a Husband could claim Mr  Pn  was very angry This was on  Thursday  Night The next Morning at all Hazards I went to wait on my Father who received me with a Coldness which struck me to the Heart I asked him if I had any way offended him He said  Mr  Pn  had used him so ill he did not desire to see his Wife  'Dear Sir said I am I not your Daughter'  'Yes said he and had you taken my Advice in letting the Villain go to the  WestIndies  I should have regarded you as such but make much of him and remember the Hour will come when you will wish you had followed your Father's Counsel'  My Aunt's Sister was with me to whom he never once spoke but walked to and fro in a sort of a distracted Manner and looked so ill that imagining my Presence disturbed him I asked him where my Mother was He said she was gone to take the Air and that he had Company to dine with him so that he could not ask me to stay I took the Hint and departed from him in such inconceivable Sorrow as I never in my Life experienced before because I really loved him more than any thing in the World  I passed the Remainder of the Day in Tears for my Husband never came home till Twelve o'Clock at Night so that I  had full Liberty to indulge my Sorrow I sent my Compliments on  Friday  and  Satur∣day  Morning to my Parents they answer∣ed they were very well but they neither asked me to come to them nor came to me  On  Sunday  I was invited to Dinner to Mr  Dubourg  's I found myself so ill that I could not go to Church however about Two o'Clock I went to dine with my Friends who looked on me with as much Surprize as if they had seen an Ap∣parition They had no sooner seated me but they both went out of the Room and held a long Consultation at the Door Little did I think how deeply I was con∣cerned in it At length Mrs  Dubourg  came in I tenderly reproached her with her Coldness to me She said she was not well and asked me had I heard from  Molesworthstreet  that Day I told her I had not She asked me if Mr  Pn  would come to Dinner I told her he was engaged to preach at  St Peter  's Church in the Afternoon and therefore went to Mrs  Warren  's where they dined early  A little while after Counsellor  Smith  came in but they called him out and held a long Conference with him In short every body behaved themselves so oddly to me that I knew not what to make of it  Just as Dinner was served up Mr  Pn  came in  'My Dear said I you are bet∣ter than Promise'  'Why says he I am not come to dine but to tell you your Father is stabbed'  Had he plunged a Dagger in my Heart it could not have given me a deeper Wound  It seems this Accident for such my Fa∣ther declared it to be happened at Nine o'Clock in the Morning and so unkind were my Mother and Sister they never sent me the least Notice of it The Company I went to had known of it some Hours before and consequently were surprized to find me ignorant of what so nearly concerned me and what by that Time all  Dublin  knew None of them could find in their Hearts to tell me of it and this was the Occasion of the many Consultations they held which had appeared so strange to me It would be tedious to my Readers to relate every  Difficulty I had even to see my Father In respect to the Ashes of my Mother I do not chuse to tell how ill I was used upon this Occasion but as I owe no sort of Re∣spect or Ceremony to my Sister if I may call her one who by no means deserves that Title I must proceed I rose from the Table had a Chair called and went to my Father's Three of the Servants sat in the Hall and my Sister excessively dirty walked to and fro in it She would wil∣lingly have kept me out but however the Servant knowing me opened the Door The first Noise which struck my Ear upon my Entrance was the deep and piercing Groans of my dear Father When I at∣tempted to go up Stairs to offer my Duty to him my Sister by Violence pulled me down but the Agony I was in for my Fa∣ther and the Resentment I conceived at her gross Usage of me supplied me with Strength to get up in despight of her When I opened the Diningroom Door the Floor was all besmeared with Blood my Mother in an arbitrary Voice asked me what Business I had there I told her  I had a Child's Right to pay my Duty to my Father She said if I spoke to him it would kill him Upon which for the first and indeed the only Time that ever I gave her an impertinent Answer I said that if every Person about my Father had loved him with half my Tenderness he would not have been reduced to the Con∣dition I was then too sure he was in Upon this I offered to go into the Bedchamber but was not only forcibly withstood but even beaten by my Mother and again asked if I intended to kill my Father I made her no Reply but sat down and as∣sured her that the first Person who opened that Door I would go in In about three Minutes time Dr  Cope  Dr  Helsham  Mr  Nicholls  and in all seven Physicians and three Surgeons as my Father was univer∣sally esteemed came of their own Accord to visit him when I heard them on the Stairs I took that Opportunity to open the Bedchamber Door in which neither my Mother nor my Sister could well op∣pose me as the Gentlemen were come into the Diningroom before they were apprised  of my Intention but Heavens how shall I describe the Agony that seized me when I beheld my dear Father pale as Death and unable to utter any thing but Groans those only who have loved a Father as well as I did mine can judge of my Condition I kneeled down by the Bedside Weak as he was he kindly reached out his Hand to me He asbed me if this was not an un∣happy Accident I begged he would not speak because Mr  Nicholls  had told me his Lungs were wounded and that every Word was detrimental to him but as I had not ever knowingly offended him I begged he would give me leave to pay my Duty to him and that he would signify it by laying his Hand on my Head which he not only did but desired I would not leave him But here my Father gave me an impossible Task for no sooner were the Gentlemen departed but my Mother said she must speak with me and whether she was really mad or counterfeited to be so I know not but she insisted on my going to Bed with her alledging that my Sister was younger and stronger than I  and better able to bear the Fatigue of sitting up This seemed to carry the Appearance of Love and Tenderness but Heaven knows it was far otherwise as I afterwards found out for the three following Days my Mother never permitted me to leave her if I ever attempted it she tore her Hair and screamed like a Lunatick The fourth Night I heard my Father ring a Bell my Mother was asleep and as my Thoughts were ever on him I ran down Stairs to him undrest as I was He seemed surprized to see me having been told that I was in my own House and would not un∣dertake the Trouble of attending him I found him in a very cold Sweat it sud∣denly came into my Head that if I could change that into a hot one it might per∣haps relieve him So after assuring him that I had not quitted him nor had ever been out of the House but was prevented by my Mother and Sister from attending on him he said he was very dry and asked me what the Physicians had ordered for him to drink As they all concluded he would not outlive that Night they had ordered  nothing but left him to take what he pleased as in spight of all Precautions to the contrary I had overheard Upon this I resolved so far to turn Physician myself as to tell him they ordered him to drink some Hock and Sack made warm Weak as he was he could not forbear smiling and saying he never heard of such another Prescription  'Ten Gentlemen meet to order me some Hock and Sack mixed said he well give it me it must certainly be a Cure for a pleuretick Fever'  I did so nay I not only gave it to him that Time but plied him with it every Time he called for Drink all Night till it produced the Effect I desired and threw him into a fine breathing Sweat and a deep Sleep It may now be demanded where my Sister was all this Time why as she had not if I may speak my Mind half the Regard for my Father that I had she was fast asleep in the ArmChair nor could he awake her  When the Physicians came in the Morn∣ing they were agreeably surprized to find my Father's Fever quite gone and his Eyes  look very lively he told them their merry Prescription had done him gre  rvice I winked at them not to undeceive him they understood me and Dr  Helsham  called me aside under Pretence of giving me some Directions but in reality to en∣quire of me what I had administered I told him and he could not forbear smiling He called the Gentlemen into the next Room to a Consultation to which present∣ly after I was summoned As both Dr  Hel∣sham  and Dr  Cope  were Men of Wit and Pleasantry they rallied me agreeably on presuming to practise Physick having never taken my Degrees and assured me I should be called before the College of Physicians and be prosecuted as an Empyrick  I rose up and making a low Courtesy I told them as the best Part of the College of Physicians were then present they would I hoped have Candour enough to permit me to make my own Defence to which they all assented by a gracious Nod and bade me proceed I then making another Reverence told them that as to my Right of practising Physick I held it  extra ju∣dice  and smiling said I supposed they all understood  Latin  but as their proper Business was to destroy Life I hoped they would not take it amiss if I for once in a Case which so nearly and deeply concern∣ed me had to the utmost of my power frustrated their Designs neither had I pre∣sumed to interfere till they themselves had assured me all Hope of my Father's Life was gone and that he could not live till Morning But said I making another Courtesy I with all respect to this ho∣nourable Board humbly presume to believe  They had rather chuse that he should die  Than their Prediction prove a Lye  Nothing except my Father's being so very weak and so very near to us could have prevented the Gentlemen's laughing hearti∣ly at my fine Harangue However I was dismissed with Honour and as my Father seemed now to want nothing but Restora∣tives I was directed to make him some Viper Broth Hartshorn Jelly Chocolate and other nourishing Aliments  From this Time we entertained Hopes of my Father's Recovery In a few Days he was so strong as to be able to sit up from Morning till Night The whole Town seemed to participate in our Joy and many who had never visited him before came now to congratulate him and his Fa∣mily on this happy Change Whether it was owing to his having seen too much Company or to his own overNeatness in insisting on having his Chamber cleaned I know not but I received a Message from Mr  Pn  that he was taken very ill and desired to see me As I had flattered myself my Father was out of Danger I obeyed the Commands of my Husband and prevailed on Mr  Nicholls  to come to visit him He had got a Cold and was a little feverish Mr  Nicholls  thought pro∣per to take a little Blood from him and I staid with him that Night and Part of the ensuing Day Mr  Pn  being much relieved gave me leave in the Evening to go to my Father's where I found all Things in Confusion and he so ill that there was now not the least Hope of his  Recovery He coughed incessantly was seized with what they call a galloping Con∣sumption and in a very few Days after expired leaving me in inconceivable Sor∣row About an Hour before he departed I left the Room being unable to see his last Agonies and went up to my Mother who was as fast locked up in Sleep as guiltless Labour Some time after I heard the Windows thrown up by which I knew his mortal Cares were ended  We had that Evening engaged a Nurse Keeper but did not dare to let her into my Father's Presence lest he should say as he once did on proposing such a thing that we were tired of him but now her Assistance was absolutely necessary tho' my Sister told me she herself helped to wash and lay my Father out I am sure I could have died sooner but some Persons have uncommon Courage or rather as  Swift  observes  Indiff'rence clad in Wisdom's Guise  All Fortitude of Mind supplies  About three o'Clock in the Morning on NewYear'sDay my Sister came into the Room and desired me to come and help her to take my Father up that he wanted to rise Tho' I was certain he was dead as I had not taken off my Cloaths I went with her and sent in the Maid to sit by my Mother I asked my Sister on the Stairs was my Father alive She answered No So with a heavy Heart I went into the DiningRoom but by no means could I summon up sufficient Spirits to look upon the claycold Figure of him who under God was the Author of my Being My Heart fluttered my Tongue refused it's Office neither had I the poor Relief of Tearsno Wonder when  the very Spring and Fountain of my Life was stoptthe very Source of it was stopped  if the Streams thereon dependant were for a while froze up and dead  While I was lost in melancholymusing my Sister was very industrious in making the TeaKettle boil I do not say this by way of Reflection on her for tho' I was less assiduous about it my own Mouth was  perfectly parched with Thirst and I was very glad of something to moisten it  When the Tea was ready unluckily we had no Sugar nor was there any in the House but what was in the TeaChest the Key of which was in my Mother's Pocket under her Head My Sister went up and waked her telling her my Father wanted a little burned Wine She readily gave it and prayed devoutly that it might do him good My Sister came down laughing to think how she had imposed on her If any thing could have added Weight to the intolerable Burthen of my Sorrows I now felt it by considering how terrible my Mother's Surprize and Disappointment must be  About six o'Clock I thought is was pro∣per to send the Chest of Plate into Dean  Madden  's and to lock up whatever was valuable a prudent Precaution as it too soon appeared After this I went into my Mother's Chamber she asked me how my Father was I told her he had been very ill in the Beginning of the Night but was now very quiet She said she hoped Sleep  would do him good I answered I trusted in God it had So she arose and would not put on her Shoes lest she should disturb him Nay so strong was the Force of her Imagination that she even said she heard him cough as we passed by his Chamber Door But a sad Counterfeit was I for when we came into his DressingRoom which opened to the Garden as it was now Daylight my Mother easily perceived the Concern in my Countenance she shrieked when she looked at me and with great Impatience asked me what ailed me  'O Lord cried she cannot you give me one Word of Comfort'  I answered very faintly I wished it was in my Power But alas her worst Fears were but too true all was over I really thought she would now have run quite mad scarcely could I prevent her going into his Chamber I sent in for Dean  Madden  who by Prayers and spiritual Advice a little calmed her but one Woe trod upon the other's Heels Mr  Nicholls  who for the particular Re∣gard he had for my Father was his first Visitor and whose Humanity during the  whole Time of his Sickness deserves a grateful Acknowledgment which if the surviving Part of his Family refuse I think it incumbent on me to pay so far at least as Words can do it came into the DiningRoom he guessed our Loss 'ere we could speak it and seemed to bear a Part in our Sorrows He asked me what Hour he should come to open my Father I told him he had left his Curse on any Person who attempted it He said he was very glad of it for as this dismal Operation must have fallen to his Share it would I am certain greatly have shocked his Hu∣manity I would have had him go up to see my Mother He said it would but re∣new her Trouble and that when she was a little more calm he would make her a Visit  I now thought it highly necessary to per∣suade my poor Mother to take at least a Dish of Tea which I could not do but by assuring her I was ready to faint Just as it was prepared a Servant looking like a Ghost opened the Door and beckoned me to follow him I did so and upon com∣ing  down Stairs found the House filled with Sheriff's Officers One of them whose Name was  Williams  was most remarkably insolent and abused me very grosly I once more sent in for Dean  Madden  I believe the worthy Gentleman thought his Words might prevail but the Scoundrel  Williams  bade him go talk in his Pulpit However I had Presence of Mind suffi∣cient to write a Line to Counsellor  Smith  he happened not to be at home so I begged of the Dean to go to my Mother least those licensed Robbers should plunder the House About seven in the Evening Mr  Smith  came he found the Wretches very busy in taking an Inventory of the Furni∣ture They were full as rude to him as they had been to the Dean and at last car∣ried it so far as to insist upon arresting my Father's Body just then laid in a Coffin I almost wild with Grief ran after them the Coffin was open and I raised my dear Father in my Arms and as if he could have heard me asked him Would he not protect his Family Mr  Smith  had in the mean Time sent for the HighSheriff he  was a young goodnatured Gentleman and after heartily reprimanding the Fellows nay and even making  Williams  beg pardon on his Knees dismissed them all except one whom he ordered not only to be civil but also to do the Work of a Ser∣vant assuring us he would take an In∣ventory of the Things himself as soon as the Funeral was over  The next Day being  Sunday  we deter∣mined to have my dear Father buried ac∣cording to his own Directions privately at Twelve o'Clock at Night and I easily prevailed on Mr  Smith  and his present Lady to give their Company to my Mother during the Time of this last sad solemn Ceremony As my Mother wept in∣cessantly it made her sleepy but the Noise made in carrying down my Father's Corpse awak'd her and as she had only slumber'd in her Chair she started up crying out they were carrying her dear Husband to the Grave and that she would go and be buried with him We were obliged by Violence to restrain her nay and also to assure her he had been interred  some Hours and that the Noise she heard was only that of the Servants who were setting Things in Order Mr  Smith  and his Lady who according to their Promise came and passed the Evening with my Mo∣ther said every thing that Reason Christi∣anity or Humanity could dictate to miti∣gate her Afflictions Gratitude for their Kindness made her endeavour to supress the Anguish of her Soul nay out of Complaisance to them she drank a Glass or two of Wine which as she had not done for some Weeks before produced the Effect I desired of making her sleep Mr  Pn  attended the Funeral Obse∣quies which was the only Proof of Re∣spect or Kindness he ever shewed to the Fa∣mily  Early the next Morning I rose and if in the melancholy Situation of my Soul any thing could have made me smile the Cookmaid's Simplicity would certainly have done it for finding her Fire made her Dishes washed and every thing set in good Order so well did the Bailiff who was left in the House obey the High Sheriff's  Orders in doing the Work of a Servant and he having walked into the Garden the Maid not recollecting there was any such Person in the House stood crossing herself and praying to the Blessed Virgin and all the Saints in Heaven I asked her What was the matter  'O my dear Ma∣dam says she my Master was always neat and see for all he is dead how he made the Fire and cleaned up the Kitchen for me'  I left the poor Girl in her Mistake and went up to my Mother It grieved me to awake her yet knowing the High Sheriff would be early with us and that the In∣ventory of what was in her Chamber must be taken I thought it was most decent for her to be up as her unhappy Situation could not authorize her taking on the State of a Lady of Quality to lie in Bed a Month for Fashion'ssake  She was not long up before the Gentle∣man came From him I learned that this Execution was laid at the Suit of the Wi∣dow  Ford  who being Executrix to her Children had asked my Father where she  could lay out their Money to Advantage As Mr  Monck  wanted Money my Father immediately thought of him but as his Estate was not liable to his Debts my Father became Surety for him This was enough for me I immediately wrote to Mr  Monck  who on Receipt of the Letter came to Town and with great Honour not only discharged his own Debt but also paid the Sheriff's Fees which in three Days amount∣ed to Twenty Pounds  This Gentleman was the late  Henry Stanly Monck  of  St Stephen's Green  My Sister like all provident Persons made the best of her Way to her Husband's Mother who being assured by Dean  Mad∣den  that he himself had married my Sister to her Son which had been questioned on Account of his abrupt Departure from her soon after he had made her a Mother was so kindly received by her new Parent that for three Weeks after she never either sent or came to know what was become of the old one  As my Father had positively prohibited us from writing any Account to my Bro∣ther  then at  Paris  of the Misfortune that had befallen him I thought it not proper to disobey him yet at the same time judged it highly necessary he should be ap∣prized of the melancholy Situation of his Affairs at home I therefore engaged a young Gentleman an intimate Friend of my Brother's to undertake the mournful Task and advise him immediately to re∣turn to  Ireland  But his best Speed could not overtake his Father's Life who had been three Weeks buried e're he arrived When he saw us in deep Mourning and missed the dear Parent who used ever to receive him with the Love of a Father and the Freedom of a Companion all his Resolution could scarce support it and tho' he endeavoured to comfort us 'twas but too visible he wanted it himself My Heart bled for him so disappointed in all his Hopes which as they had been high raised were now the more depressed In short we were all mere Outside each endeavouring by a forced Chearfulness to conceal their inward Anguish from each other  As my Brother soon after sold off the Goods by Auction and placed my Mother who was left entirely dependant on him to board at a Clergyman's House in the Coun∣try after which I never saw her more I returned to my own House  Mr  Pn  having now no Expecta∣tion of a Fortune by me he threw off all Disguise and shewed himself in his proper Colours he had it seems while I was in the Country in a bad State of Health got in League with the Widow  Wrrn  whom he intended if I had died as was expected should supply my Place How∣ever he was resolved to gid rid of me at any rate and as nothing but my Death or a Divorce could accomplish his Desires the latter seemed the safer Method To this End he set all his Engines to work His first Scheme I shall here relate  One Morning pretty early he sent for me to come to him to Breakfast in the Summerhouse as I thought he was alone I ran to him quite undrest but was con∣founded at the Sight of a Gentleman whom I had never seen before and who was drest  out with the utmost Magnificence and Cu∣riosity rather in the Habit of a BirthNight Beau than a Morning Visitor I was for retiring but Mr  Pn  obliged me to come in and introduced him to me I sat down with the best Grace I could and made the Tea Before it was half over Mr  Pn  said he was obliged to go visit a sick Person but that he should re∣turn in half an Hour engaging me not to let the Gentleman go till then at the same time assuring him I was very well qualified to entertain him agreeably The Gentle∣man did not express the least Reluctance at complying with his Request so far from it that as soon as he was gone he said he was much indebted to Mr  Pn  's Complaisance for the favourable Oppor∣tunity he had afforded him of speaking his Wishes and laying hold of my Hand he began to address me in a most bom∣bastic Stile with Fustian from exploded Plays For my part I thought he was mad and growing angry at what I deemed a great Incivility to a married Woman I assured him if he persisted in such Imper∣tinence  I would quit the Place He then begged Pardon most humbly indeed for he threw himself on the Carpet at my Feet swearing he would never rise till I had forgiven him which not to be plagued with his farther Impertinence I was forced to say I did He then wanted me to confirm it by a Kiss but that I would by no means grant In short his Company was so tiresome that I most im∣patiently longed for a Release which however Mr  Pn  was resolved not to give me So finding the Gentleman was determined to prosecute me I told him I was engaged to dine abroad and hoped he would excuse my leaving him as I ex∣pected a Lady to call upon me which laid me under a Necessity of going to dress  Upon this civil Dismiss to my great Sa∣tisfaction he took his Leave promising me he would do himself the Honour of waiting on me again very speedily to which I made no Reply  I believe he went to Mr  Pn  to give him an Account of what had past  who some time after returned and seemed much offended that I had suffered his Friend as he called him to go away add∣ing that he was related to the Duke of  Dorset  and might by his Interest get him a good Living I answered Let him be ever so well related he was a very troublesome Coxcomb and if he liked such Company I did not  A few Days after my youngest Child died and that I might avoid seeing the Funeral I retired to the SummerHouse where I sat weeping when suddently this same fine Spark opened the Door He told me Mr  Pn  had sent him to desire I would have some Coffee ready and that he would be at home immediately I desired the Gentleman to go with me to the DwellingHouse not chusing to stay alone with him at so great a Distance from every Body The Coffee was prepared but no Mr  Pn  came so we drank it without him and the Gentleman fell into his old Vagaries again I then  All smarting with my Griefs being vex'd  To be so pestered by a Popinjay  Shakespear  Burst into Tears and demanded of him what he meant by such Insolence He looked v  y much confounded and asked me was I in earnest I assured him I was and that I would acquaint Mr  Pn  with his Rudeness He smiled at that Threat and to my great Surprize made me the following Speech  'Madam I am convinced by your Behaviour that you are a Woman of Honour and am very sorry I should be so unfortunate as to provoke your Tears The best Re∣compence I can make you is to entrust you with a Secret and I doubt not but you will have Discretion enough to make a proper use of it Mr  Pn  de∣scribed you to me as a Lady very li∣beral of your Favours and begged I would be so kind as to make him a Cuckold so that he might be able to prove it in order to a Separation from  you promising to give me Time and Opportunity for it He assured me it would be no difficult Task that I need but throw myself at your Feet whine out some Tragedy and you would quick∣ly yield But I am now convinced that he is a very great Vn and very un∣worthy of you'  I leave my Reason to judge of my Asto∣nishment I could scarce give the Gentle∣man Credit and yet it was but too evident that he spoke Truth as it was now nine o'Clock at Night and Mr  Pn  not come home to his invited Guest  When I had recovered Power to speak I told him I supposed Mr  Pn  knew him to be a Person destitute of all Honour and Humanity when he proposed such a Scheme to him as that of betraying any Woman  'Faith Madam returned he I never intended it for had you made me happy I would like a Gentleman have forsworn it and also have given you a proper Caution But I would not pay you so ill a Compliment as not to assure you the Bait was very illuring  I believe there are very few young Fel∣lows who would have refused him the Favour he desired of me'  I then beg∣ged he would be so kind to leave me which accordingly taking his Leave very respectfully he did  I went to Bed full of Disquietude but the bitter Anguish of my Soul quite banish∣ed Sleep I considered the Snares were laid for me and that he who ought to be the Guardian and Protector of my In∣nocence was the very first Person who sought to destroy it I wept abundantly and prayed heartily to God to deliver me out of my Trouble at length I fell into a Slumber when methought my Father just as I had seen him in his Coffin drew open the Curtain and muttered something to me very low and indistinct but the Words  Trouble Sorrow  and  Shame  I very plainly heard I started up and turned the Head Curtain back but seeing nothing con∣cluded the Trouble of my Mind produced such terrifying Dreams and recommend∣ing myself to Heaven once more addressed myself to Sleep when suddenly me∣thought  I was in the midst of a Parcel of Ruffians who were fighting and that I though I knew not why was the Occasion of their Quarrel At last I thought one of them gave me a severe Blow over the Head at which I screamed out and Mr  Pn  who was now in the Chamber waked me and asked me what was the matter I told him I had a very shocking Dream  'Why says he you grieve so much after your Father and your Brat and take no Sustenance that it is no Wonder you should be in the Vapours'  I desired he would be so kind as give me a little Water for I was in a faint cold Sweat but as he always kept some CherryBrandy in his Study he made me take a little of it which greatly revived me I then told him Mr  Hd  had been to see him He asked me how long he stayed I answered till I was weary of him  'Why did he offend you'  'Indeed returned I he did'  'How'  said he  'By a great deal of Impertinence not worth relating I suppose said he the Coxcomb was re∣peating  his Poetry to you'  'No re∣turned I he spoke nothing of his own he had a proper Authority I believe for whatever he said'  I looked earnest∣ly in Mr  Pn  's Face and could easily perceive he was in great Confusion so he put out the Candle and came to Bed without asking me any farther Questions  Early the next Morning he went out of Town without either leaving a Shilling to provide for his Family which consisted of a Maid a Footman two Children and my∣self or any Person to serve his Cure nei∣ther did I for the Space of two Months hear from him or receive any Supply till at last by Accident I learned he was with the Widow  Wrrn  For the Truth of this the Reverend Dr  Bradford  can bear Witness I mean so far as his going away without either asking his Permission or sub∣stituting any Person to do his Duty  But when a Lady's in the Case  All other Bus'ness must give Place  Gay's Fables  Even in Religion itself  I now beg leave to demand of every Person who has been severe in their Cen∣sures of me what Duty Love or Re∣spect was due to such a Husband When an honest Man is linked to a pe  sidious Wo∣man his Misfortun  s claim Compassion b  ure a voluntary Cuckold is the mean∣est Wretch in Human Nature and de∣serves nothing from the World but the ut∣most Contempt  In the mean time the Parish was quite in an Uproar nobody to visit the Sick or read Six o'Clock Prayers I related this Part of my Distress to my Brother who prevailed on a young Gentleman who had been his Schoolfellow and Companion then newly ordained to do Mr  Pn  's Duty  As for my two Children I sent them to School and they dined every Day with Mr  Pn  's Father the Servants were forced to run in Debt for Provision and for my own part I quartered myself on my next Door Neighbours Mr  Lindsay  and his Spouse where I always met a chear∣ful and friendly Reception  I must here observe that because I loved reading Mr  Pn  took with him the Key of his Study into which he had re∣moved all my Books Presents to me from my Friends before I was married He also locked up the Garden rather chusing it should be overgrown with Weeds and the Plants and Flowers die for Want of Water than that either I or the Children should have the Pleasure of amusing our∣selves in it The Teachest was also se∣cured so I was left like a tame Cat with the Liberty of walking about through two or three empty Rooms  When I had learned where Mr  Pn  was I wrote to him but received no Answer At length one  Saturday  about Twelve o'Clock at Noon his Horse was brought home and a mangy Dog of which I was ordered to take a particular care which I did and now expected the Mas∣ter But as his buxom old Widow and old enough she was to be my Mother and big enough to make four of me came to Town with him he stayed with her till Twelve o'Clock at Night His first Ques∣tion  when he entered was where was his Dog with which having played about half an Hour hugging kissing and calling it an Angel he at last vouchsafed to come up Stairs I sat in my Closet in a very pensive Posture his first Salutation to me was to ask me how I had the Impudence to write to him about my Family Affairs I asked him to whom else should I write  'Very fine returned he suppose Mrs  Wrrn  had opened my Letter'  'I could not suppose that Sir because it is a Liberty I never took with you'  'You took with me why should you  'Nay then said I why should she  'I have said he great Patience that I do not turn you out of Doors'  'As soon as you please Sir I know my Way to  St Sepulchres  and late as it is I dare say they will give me Admission'  I believe he thought he had now gone too far and was more than half afraid I would publish all his Villanies so he fell into his old Trade of Dissimulation in which he is a perfect Master and taking me by the Hand told me he did not  think so gentle a Temper as mine could be disturbed at any Thing and that it was very unkind in me to be disobliged at his taking a little Recreation in the Country adding that he often wished for me there I asked him why he did not take me with him He said he had proposed it to Mrs  Wrrn  but that she had objected a∣gainst it telling him I was a Woman of so bad a Reputation that she would not for all the World countenance me I must beg leave to ask my Readers what Sort of Terms this Couple must be on when she took the Liberty of traducing his Wife to him She may be very chaste for aught I know but I verily believe many an un∣happy Creature who has even prostituted herself for Bread would not have been guilty of her Crime  Cursed be he that parteth Man and Wife  is Part of our  AshWednesday  Service to which I say  Amen  with all my Heart and Soul  But to return I told Mr  Pn  I was extremely obliged to the Lady that most Men even if they hated their Wives  would resent any Injury offered to them as being Part of themselves but he was too good a Christian for that So I arose and was for leaving the Room He asked me where I was going I answered  'To sleep with my Children for why should I Sir go to bed to a Man in whose Person Mind or Fortune I have no longer a Share and who has actually divorced him∣self from me as the Law can do'  However he insisted on my staying with him which accordingly I did We both rose pretty early and the Children coming in to ask his Blessing he whipt his Daugh∣ter severely because as he said she re∣sembled my Mother though indeed she was infinitely more like his own And to shew his Impartiality he whipt the poor little Boy for being like himself  When this Scene was over the Children were turned down to the Kitchen and the mangy Dog which it seems was given him by Mrs  Wrrn  invited to a good Plate of Toast and Butter and half a Pint of Cream for his Breakfast so well did he  fulfil the old Proverb  Love me love my Dog  After these Holy Exercises he went to the Communion which indeed I had in∣tended to do but as he had really vexed me past my Patience I could not compose my∣self sufficiently for the worthily receiving those sublime Mysteries  Thus we may see it is in the power of a bad Man not only to destroy our temporal but also our eternal Happiness  I saw no more of him till Midnight buxom  Joan  engaging him till then or in other Words the Widow  Wrrn  Mr  Pn  's Father hearing he was in Town came the next Morning to see him and demanded of him the Money he had paid for his Childrens Tuition upon which he turned to me with an Air of great Con∣tempt and told me he thought when he had married so accomplished a Lady she might have taught her Children to read write work  c  and at least have saved him the Expence of their Education I told him and indeed it was Truth that I should never desire a more delightful Em∣ployment  than that of cultivating their Minds but that he ought to consider he left no Support for our Bodies and conse∣quently I was obliged to go abroad every Day to seek for Food and could not en∣cumber such Company as I might be wel∣come to with my Children Here Mr  Pn  's Father interrupted me by say∣ing I might always have been welcome to him Indeed I doubt it not for he was a goodnatured Man but as he kept an Ale∣house it was no very agreeable Place for me to pass my Time in  Next Morning buxom  Joan  came in her own Coach for her Chaplain a Right which most Widows of Fortune claim I looked at her and she hid her Face Mr  Pn  soon waited on her and away they went together leaving me just as de∣solate as I was before  Mr  Pn  has often alledged in order to prove me an Adultress as I was with Child when we parted that he had no manner of matrimonial Commerce with me for four Years I was but just four and twenty Years of Age when we were sepa∣rated  and as my Reader may observe he would not permit me to have a separate Bed whether what he not only said but swore was true or false I do not see how he could gain any Honour by it  For as the  Spanish  Friar says when old  Gomez  boasts that his Wife was a spotless Virgin for him  A fine Commendation truly  The Church did not put you together for that  And here gentle Reader give me leave to drop the Curtain To avouch mine own Innocence in a Point where Appear∣ances were strong against me would per∣haps little avail me The supreme Judge of Hearts alone will at the last great Day clear or condemn me to whose unerring Justice and boundless Goodness I submit my Cause  When Snares and LimedTwigs are spread for a poor Bird it cannot well escape Yet I may say with the condemned Duke of  Buckingham  in  Shakespear  's  Henry the Eighth  We both fell by our Servants  Therefore this receive as certain  Where you are lib'ral of your Loves and Coun∣sels  Be sure you are not loose for those you make Friends  And give your Hearts to when they perceive  The least Rub in your Fortune fall away  Like Water from ye never found again  But where they mean to sink ye  A proper Caution to both Sexes to be duly on their Guard against Confidants  I could reckon up numberless Instances of Mr  Pn  's Aversion to me one in particular I cannot pass over One Day at Dinner the Pin in the Robing of my Gown pricked my Breast as there was no body but my Husband and Children present I made no Scruple of uncovering my Bosom to examine what had hurt me upon which Mr  Pn  rose from Table and said I had turned his Stomach As I really had a fine Skin and was then a most remarkably neat Person I thought he only  jested and merrily told him he should kiss my Breast and make it well But alas it was not like  Prior  's  Lover's Anger  where when the Lady complains that  An ugly hard Rosebud has fall'n in my Neck  It has vex'd me and plagu'd me to such a Degree  Look here now you'll never believe one pray see  I' th' Left Side of my Breast what a Mark it has made  So saying her Bosom she careless display'd  That Seat of Delight I with Wonder sur∣vey'd  And forgot ev'ry Word I design'd to have said  For he told me he was sure he should faint if I came near him and either pretended to throw up his Dinner or did it in reality After which polite Compliment he drank a large Glass of Cherrybrandy to settle his Stomach and repaired to his usual Haunt  i e  to buxom  Joan  About Twelve at Night he returned and awaked me out of a sweet Sleep by telling me I was a most expensive extrava∣gant Woman I asked him in what He said in putting on clean Linen every Day whereas Mrs  Wrrn  who had a Thou∣sand Pounds a Year assured him she never shifted herself but once a Week and shewed him Halfsleeves which she wore to save the Expence of washing I answered him very carelesly that I supposed that was what charmed him and therefore Dirt to Dirt  I beg leave here to remark that my Hus∣band's Complaints were very different from those of most married Men their general Excuse for going astray is that their Wives are dirty slothful ignorant  c  the very Reverse of which swinish Qualities made my good Man hate me  Well grant me guilty which never yet was proved  Yet I do think if Wives do fall it is their Husbands Fault  Say that they slack their Duty and pour our Treasure into foreign Laps  Or else break out in peevish Jealousy  Throwing Restraint on us Or say they strike us  Or scant our former Having in Despight  Why we have Galls and though we have some Grace  Yet we have some Revenge Let Hus∣bands know  Their Wives have Sense like them They see and smell  And have their Palates both for sweet and sour  As Husbands have What is it that they do  When they change us for others Is it Sport  I think it is And doth Affection breed it  I think it doth Is't Frailty that thus errs  It is so too And have not we Affections  Desire for Sport and Frailty as Men have  Then let them use us well or let them know  The Ills we do their Ills instruct us to  Shakespear  And in one of the Sermons on Social Duties published lately by a real Divine he makes this Observation That he be∣lieves very few Women have either been so weak or so wicked to wrong the Mar∣riagebed but when they have been pro∣voked to it either by the ill Treatment they received from their Husbands or in Re∣venge to their prior Falshoods  If I have not delivered the most worthy Author's Sentiments with his own Elegance of Style I am sure he will pardon me as I only quote from Memory not being Mis∣tress of his admirable Works  I do assure my Reader I do not by those Quotations mean to countenance Vice  Or to arm my Pen  Against the Sunclad Power of Chastity  Milton  So far from it that in my Opinion Nothing can excuse the Breach of it and a Fe∣male  Should strip herself to Death as to a Bed  Which longing she'd been sick for  Rather than yield her Body up to Shame  All I intend is this the World has been pleased to say I had a most excellent Hus∣band and therefore have thought proper not thinking their Bill of Accusation large enough to add  Ingratitude  to every other Vice and Folly they are pleased to attribute to me  But so many Yards of Prunella and a Bit of clear Cambrick properly placed under the Chin it seems make a Holy Man  Yet let's write Good Angel on the De∣vil's Horn  'Tis not the Devil's Crest  And so an outward Sainted Priest may  In all his Dressings Titles Caracts Forms  Be an Archvillain and his Filth being cast  Appear a Pond as deep as Hell  Shakespear  I hope Mr  Pn  will return his Acknowledgments to me for making him publicly known for as I hear his Poems have suffered the Fate of all Things mor∣tal and to use his own Lines  Since he and his Writings so soon are forgotten  E'er his Carcass become like his Prin∣ciples rotten  My Muse shall forbid it transmitting his Merits  As the Curious for Shew preserve Mon∣sters in Spirits  Pn  's Elegy on the Rev Mr  Graffan  written many Years before the Gentleman's Death  And so if my  Quondam  Husband arrives at Fame or ever goes to Heaven either of which I very much doubt I think he must still rest my Debtor  For  Fame  has but two Doors a white and a black one  The worst you say he's stole in at the back one  And that Cuckolds go to Heaven no body ever yet disputed Were he one he ought to thank me that helped to send him thi∣ther If I have bestowed on him Fame in this World and Salvation in the next what could a reasonable Man desire more from his Wife But some Folks are never to be satisfiedBut whether he is entitled to the Horn or not must always be a Se∣cret I hope some curious Commentator will hereafter endeavour to find out the Truth of it for my Mind gives me  That I like the Classics shall be read  When Time and all the World are dead  And if a  Scotch  Barber one  Allan Ramsay  promises himself so much in a Sort of Bur∣lesque on  Horace  why may I not be in∣dulged  in equal Vanity the ruling and darling Passion of our Sex Tho' I shall never carry it to such an unnatural Height as Dr  Young  makes a Lady do when she is dying  Odious in Woollen 'twould a Saint pro∣voke  Were the last Words that dying Flavia spoke  No let a charming Chintz and  Flander's  Lace  Shade my pale Corse and deck my lifeless Face  One wou'd not sure look ugly when one's dead  And  Betty  give my Cheeks a little red  I must beg my Reader's Pardon for these numerous Quotations but as  Swift  says  'those anticipating Rascals the Ancients have left nothing for us poor Moderns to say'  But still to shew my Vanity let it stand as some sort of Praise that I have stolen wisely  At length the fatal Hour arrived when Mr  Pn  's Machinations wrought the Effect he so long desired namely my De∣struction  and as he never did Things by Halves that of his own Children also to whom his Barbarity has exceeded any thing I ever either heard or read of but that in due Place  I own myself very indiscreet in permit∣ting any Man to be at an unseasonable Hour in my BedChamber but Lovers of Learning will I am sure pardon me as I solemnly declare it was the attractive Charms of a new Book which the Gentle∣man would not lend me but consented to stay till I read it through that was the sole Motive of my detaining him But the Servants being bribed by their Master let in twelve Watchmen at the Kitchen Win∣dow who though they might have open∣ed the ChamberDoor chose rather to break it to pieces and took the Gentleman and myself Prisoners  For my own Part I thought they had been Housebreakers and would willingly have compounded for Life when entered Mr  Pn  with a Cambric Hand∣kerchief tied about his Neck after the Fashion of Mr  Fribble  and with the  Temper of a Stoic bid the authorized Ruffians not hurt me But his Christian Care came too late for one of them had given me a violent Blow on the Temple and another had dragged two of my Fin∣gers out of Joint The Gentleman at the Sight of Mr  Pn  threw down his Sword which he observing made two of the Watchmen hold him while he most courageously broke his Head  After this heroic Action he told me who stood quite stupified between Surprize and Pain that I must turn out of Doors but observing that I was fainting he brought up a Bottle of Wine and kindly drank both our Healths He would fain have prevailed on us to pledge him but we were not in a Temper to return Civili∣ty Upon which he took my Hand and very generously made a Present of me to the Gentleman who could not in Honour refuse to take me especially as his own Liberty was not to be procured on any other Terms Mr  Pn  kindly dis∣missed our Guards and assured us as soon as ever he had obtained a Divorce he  would with great Pleasure join us together in holy Matrimony At the Door the Gentleman's Sword was delivered to him Mr  Pn  offered to kiss me at part∣ing which mean Piece of Dissimulation so much in the Stile of  Jack Ketch  gave me the utmost Contempt for the Vn  It was by this time two o'Clock in the Morning and we knew not where to steer our Course However the Gentleman's Servant always sat up for him and there∣fore he judged it more adviseable to go to his own Lodging than to search for any other and truly I little cared where I went  And here I sincerely assure my Reader that neither of us even entertained a Thought of any thing like Love but sat like Statues till Daybreak when recollect∣ing that I had nothing to change me with I wrote a Letter to Mr  Pn  to desire he would send me my wearing Apparel or at least some clean Linen  He complied with my Request and wrote me a long Letter wherein he seemingly ex∣pressed an infinite Concern for my Loss but  as I had most strenuously recommended our Children to his Care he gave it then un∣der his Hand that he was perfectly con∣vinced they were his own and that I might depend on his Tenderness to them but at the same time as he was determined to be legally divorced he expected I would not give him any Opposition in it  Before I received this Letter I had taken a Lodging in  Abbeystreet  up two pair of Stairs where my Clothes were brought to me together with it but not a single Shilling to assist me my Watch my Books and even what few Jewels I possessed be∣fore Marriage were detained from me which threw me quite dependant on the Courtesy of the Person I was accused with  But Mr  Pn  was so highly pro∣voked at our not cohabiting together as he wished that he forced the Gentleman to fly who having Notice that there was an Action taken out against him made the best of his way to  London  leaving a Letter with five Guineas enclosed in it for  me in the Hands of a Dissenting Minister who very faithfully discharged his Trust  Curiosity made me go to the Gentle∣man's Lodging to enquire of his Land∣lady what she knew relating to him the Gentlewoman was very obliging but could give me no Satisfaction or Light into the Affair However she made me drink Tea with her and we sat together till near nine o'Clock at Night  At my return to my own Lodging the Maid told me my Room was Let I said that was odd as it was taken by the Week and one not then expired to Let it with∣out giving me Warning to provide myself which at that Hour in a Winter's Night it was impossible for me to do  The Maid to whose care this House was entrusted for I know not who was Land∣lord told me I might if I pleased lie in the first Floor as the Family were not come to Town and there were only their Servants in the House whom she could dispose of into worse Beds but to my great Surprize I found the Lock had been taken off the Bedchamber Door which I will remem∣bered  had been on it in the Morning as I had some Difficulty to open it to take thence some China  I asked her the meaning of it She in∣sisted positively that there never had been a Lock on it which knowing to be a Falshood I began to be apprehensive some foul play was intended nor was I mistaken  I then asked her for a young Woman whom she had told me was a Servant out of Place that lodged in the back Parlour she said she was a Bed in the Garret and that my Trunk was there also this gave me a sufficient Excuse as there was no Lock on the Trunk to go up to her and as she had been a Lady's Woman and very well knew who I was I told her all my Appre∣hensions and she readily consented to quit her own Bed and come to mine  We brought down the Trunk between us and placed it against the ChamberDoor as the Maid was busied with her new Guests she took it for granted I was alone and therefore resolved to provide me with  a Male Bedfellow as a proper Consolation for a Person in my unhappy Situation  About seven o'Clock in the Morning not then clear Day she very furiously pushed open the ChamberDoor and told me one Mr  Bk  desired to breakfast with me who was a Member of Pt and a Man of Fortune and the Person who had taken the House I told her I never wished to see any human Creature and should be glad I could hide myself even from my∣self but she supposing me to be alone directly introduced a Man full six Feet high and of the most disagreeable Aspect I ever beheldPerhaps it was my Terror that painted him so to my Imagination  I started up and threw my Gown about me but I was not quite so quick in putting on my Clothes as the Gentleman was in taking his off resolving without the least Ceremony to come to Bed to me I pulled my Companion who asked him what he meant why who the Dl are you you old Bch said he This Lady mean∣ing me is publickly known thro' all the Coffeehouses in  Dublin  Had the Gentle∣man  been studying how to disappoint his own Intentions he could not more effectual∣ly have done it as he brought all the Horror of my Condition full upon my Mind And as I had no Protector no Friend no Guardian I burst into Tears and told him if he was a Gentleman he would not insult Misery  'Do I occasion Tears Madam'  'You do Sir and and therefore I desire you will depart'  'Well Madam said he I beg pardon I had a full History of you from the Maid of the House who said she believed a Companion would not be disagreeable to you especially as she was apprehensive you had no Money'  'Sir said I she is mistaken I have at least enough to dis∣charge my Lodging which I will imme∣diately do and once more I desire you to withdraw which accordingly he did'  I then prevailed on the young Woman who was with me to take a Lodging for me and in about half an Hour I went to it  But now came the general Slander Charge  Which some invent the rest enlarge  So from my Heart I wrote the following Lines  SORROW  WHILE sunk in deepest Solitude and Woe  My streaming Eyes with ceaseless Sorrow flow  While Anguish wears the sleepless Night away  And fresher Grief awaits returning Day  Encompassed round with Ruin Want and Shame  Undone in Fortune blasted in my Fame  Lost to the soft endearing Ties of Life  And tender Names of Daughter Mother Wife  Can no Recess from Calumny be found  And yet can Fate inflict a deeper Wound  As one who in a dreadful Tempest toss'd  If thrown by Chance upon some desert Coast  Calmly a while surveys the fatal Shore  And hopes that Fortune can inflict no more  Till some fell Serpent makes the Wretch his Prey  Who 'scaped in vain the Dangers of the Sea  So I who hardly 'scap'd Domestic Rage  Born with eternal Sorrows to engage  Now feel the poisonous Force of sland'rous Tongues  Who daily wound me with envenom'd Wrongs  Shed then a Ray Divine all Gracious Heav'n  Pardon the Soul that sues to be forgiv'n  Tho' cruel Humankind relentless prove  And least resemble thee in Acts of Love  Tho' Friends who shou'd administer Relief  Add Pain to Woe and Misery to Grief  And oft too oft with Hypocritic Air  Condemn those Faults in which they deeply shaer  Yet thou who dost our various Frailties know  And see'st each Spring from whence our Actions flow  Shalt while for Mercy to thy Throne I fly  Regard the lifted Hand and streaming Eye  Thou didst the jarring Elements compose  Whence this harmonious Universe arose  O speak the Tempest of the Soul to Peace  Bid the tumultuous War of Passion cease  Receive me to thy kind Paternal Care  And guard me from the Horrors of Despair  And since no more I boast a Mother's Name  Nor in my Children can a Portion claim  The helpless Babes to thy Protection take  Nor punish for their hapless Mother's sake  Thus the poor Bird when frighted from her Nest  With agonizing Love and Grief distress'd  Still fondly hovers o'er the much lov'd Place  Tho' strengthless to protect her tender Race  In piercing Notes she movingly complains  And tells the unattending Woods her Pains  Mem My Husband who was then suing for a Divorce  And thou once my Soul's fondest dearest Part  Who schem'd my Ruin with such cruel Art  From human Laws no longer seek to find  A Pow'r to loose that Knot which God has join'd  The Props of Life are rudely pull'd away  And the frail Building falling to Decay  My Death shall give thee thy desir'd Release  And lay me down in everlasting Peace  I believe Mr  Pn  would say with old Sir  Paul Plyant  when he finds a Love Letter from a Gentleman to his Wife signed your dying  Ned Careless  'Ads bud I wish it were true'  But  My kind Companion never fear  For tho' you may mistake a Year  Tho' your Prognosticks run too fast  They'll certainly prove true at last  Swift  But I had a FellowLodger one Mr  Don∣nellan  an Ensign who it seems knew me so well that he thought proper to bring the late Earl of  Rsse  of facetious Me∣mory and several other Persons of Distinc∣tion to break open my Lodging On hearing them coming up Stairs I ran into the DiningRoom and locked myself in When those worthy Prs could not find me they threatened to kick the Landlady and one of them putting his Mouth to the Keyhole of the DiningRoom cried  'Do my Dear open the Door by Heaven it is nobody but I  Dg  the Fiddler'  I made no Reply so being disappointed they were forced to decamp cursing and vowing Revenge against the Woman of the House  This Accident so terribly alarmed me that I resolved to quit this Lodging the next Day but Mr  Dn  was de∣termined not to permit me to depart in Peace for being a military Man he stood Centinel at the Door of my Chamber all Night frequently intreating me to let him in but truly had I been amorously in∣clined  the Sight of the various Medicines in his Apartment would have  Damp'd all Passion sympathetic  For as I had a back Room when this Gentleman was abroad I frequently for Variety went into his which looked into the Street  However at last he went to Bed and early next Morning he told the Landlady that I had kept him awake all Night and that I was a most notorious common St  'Arah by my Shoul said the old Dame you would make her one if you could What Business had you and all those Lords with her One of them bid the Devil to breake my own Neck but I hope he will be hanged first'  While my Landlady to whom I had never told my Name related this to me I heard somebody enquire for Mrs  Pilking∣ton  so I desired to know who it was and up came a very well drest matron like Fe∣male of about Fifty she expressed great  Concern for my Misfortunes said my dear Father had saved her Life and that she was at present Housekeeper to the Earl of  Am  who was extremely troubled for his Rudeness to me and hoped I would give him an Opportunity of beg∣ging my Pardon I told her as I did not know whom to blame I wanted no Apo∣logy it was my wretched Fate to be sub∣ject to the Insolence of every Fellow  She then urged what I own was a pre∣vailing Argument to one not worth a Shil∣ling that my Lord was very generous and would she was sure make me a hand∣some Present in Recompence of the Ter∣ror he had put me into As I looked on my present Circumstances to be quite de∣sperate being near Lyingin and having nothing to assist me I agreed to see him any where except at my own Lodging Upon which the artful old Crone told me of a House in the Neighbourhood a very reputable one according to her Account where my Lord would meet me in the Evening  Accordingly I went but let any one judge of my Surprize when instead of the Earl I met a Gentleman whom I had never seen before So I instantly departing left him to his Contemplations And in Pro∣cess of Time it came to light that the venerable Housekeeper of the Earl was neither better or worse than the celebrated Mother  Brown  And indeed I received many Visits from Ladies of her sublime Calling  And what most surprised me was that they were generally employed by sober mar∣ried Men and such as to my own Know∣ledge lived very well with their Wives but these Ladies assured me their Husbands hated them and would rather have any other Woman So I found I was not a∣lone in my Misfortune And if every married Man who has ever attacked me does not subscribe to my  Memoirs  I will without the least Ceremony insert their Names be their Rank ever so high or their Profession ever so holy  I'll dash the proud Gamester from his gilded Car  Bare the mean Heart that lurks beneath a Star  And the more formal Villains who in the Robes of Sanctity commit worse Frauds then Highwaymen surely ought not to re∣main unexposed  For me while Heav'n affords me vital Breath  Let them behold me as their Scourge till Death  Them thro' their Serpent Mazes I'll pursue  And bring each latent Vice to public View  And what their Cunning studies to conceal  Shall be my constant Pleasure to reveal  Till warn'd Mankind shall from their Mischiefs fly  And hate them more if possible than I  Ay my little good Lord Cardinal  I'll scare you worse than did the Midnight Bell  When the brown Wench lay kissing in your Arms  Mem My Maid on the Carpet    I once was acquainted with a Prelate who had certain stated Prices for all his Sins as thus     l  s  d  For Adultery        For Simple Fornication        For Venial Transgressions      each  And  Yet he was a Bp and he wore a Mitre  Which in all in good Time may be  Surrounded with Jewels of Sulphur and Nitre  How nearly this Bp my Bp re∣sembles  But his has the Odds who believes and who trembles  What I thought most cruel in him was that he never gave a Farthing to the poor Women themselves But to make up Mat∣ters with Heaven he took up ten Bastards every Year fed clothed and apprenticed them hoping no doubt as his Dealings were pretty promiscuous some one of them might belong to him So  How could his Charity be better shewn  Or whom should he provide for but his own  As I do not chuse to be guilty of  Scan∣dalum magnatum  if nobody can guess who I mean I will fairly acknowledge myself to be as arrant a Dunce as any Bp or Parson in the World and really that is speaking largely  Considering what Dulness reigns  Amongst our Ps Priests and Deans  And as  Milton  observes on the Devil's breaking into Paradise  So since into God's Fold  Climb Thieves and Ruffians and lewd hireling Slaves  Turning the Sanctuary of th' Almighty  Into a Den  And it were to be wished that our Blessed Saviour would once more come and drive those MoneyChangers out of the Temple  I was again once more obliged to change my Lodging and knew not how to provide for the approaching Calamity I wrote to Mr  Pn  who generously sent me Six∣pence by my eldest Son to put me above the Temptations to which Want exposes our helpless Sex for so he expressed him∣self in a long Epistle he wrote with it  But when things are at the worst they generally mend for who should arrive from  London  but Mr  Wle  He no sooner heard of my Misfortune but he came to visit me and as he had a strange Ambition to be thought a Poet he assured me if I would devote my Genius to his Service he would liberally reward me to which I gladly consented as an easy and  honourable Method of getting a Subsist∣ence  I really would not be so ungenerous to strip the  JackDaw  of his borrowed Plumes but that his Usage of me in  Lon∣don  was so inhuman that it merits a worse Punishment from me than meerly expos∣ing his Vanity and the World may con∣clude  That of all the fine Things which he keeps in the Dark  There's scarce one in ten but what has my Mark  Though Mr  Pn  and  Harry Cry  were his two Subalterns or under Strappers in poetical Stockjobbing As Mr  Wle  was a musical Man my first Task was to write a Song for him which I performed in the following manner  STELLA  Darling of the Muses  Fairer than the blooming Spring  Sweetest Theme the Poet chuses  When of thee he strives to sing  While my Soul with Wonder traces  All thy Charms of Face and Mind  All the Beauties all the Graces  Of the Sex in thee I find  Love and Joy and Admiration  In my Breast alternate rise  Words no more can paint my Passion  Than the Pencil cou'd thine Eyes  Lavish Nature thee adorning  O'er thy Lips and Cheeks hath spread  Colours that might shame the Morning  Smiling with celestial Red  Would the Gods in blest Condition  Our Requests indulgent view  Sure each Mortal's first Petition  Would be to resemble you  Mr  Wle  shewed this Ballad to Mr  Pn  who thought proper to alter the last Verse giving it this prophane and non∣sensical Turn  Cou'd the Gods in blest Condition  Aught on Earth with Envy view  Lovely  Stella  their Ambition  Wou'd be to resemble you  As for the Gods envying Mortals and wish∣ing to be like them it has neither Sense  English  nor even Novelty to recommend it nor is it agreeable to the Dictates of Reason or Religion for even a Heathen Author stands condemned for setting  Cato  in a Light superior to the Gods but a Christian Divine may say any thing and so much for an old Song  I thought my Circumstances might have secured me from any farther Attacks from the Male World but it seems I was to have no more Rest than the Patriarch's Dove had for I had a furious Onset from  A Tinsel Babler Blunderbuss of Law  Newburgh's Hiena  One  Cn  a Person not otherwise known than by his being acquainted with all the  Tricks and Roguery of the Courts who because I treated him with the Contempt he deserved railed at me wherever he went insomuch that I was obliged to compliment him with the following Lines  To Counsellor  CN  WHY  Cn  with cruel Aim  Seek you to hurt a wounded Fame  Or how have I provok'd your Rage  To bring me thus upon the Stage  'Tis true indeed I cou'd not love you  But why should that so greatly move you  Are you not us'd to plead in vain  And practis'd to endure Disdain  You tamely bear the Scorn of Men  Why vex'd at it from Women then  When you approach'd me in Disguise  And swore to fifty thousand Lyes  And more your self to recommend  Basely traduc'd your absent Friend  When you invok'd each Pow'r to prove  The Truth and Ardour of your Love  I look'd thro' all the vile Deceit  Saw  Cn  and knew the CHEAT  Thy Wife with Hide of well tann'd Oak  May sure to rove her Spouse provoke  And you from Cuckoldom be safe  Either from  Dcy  or from  Tffe  And Jealousy must be a Jest  For her whom all Mankind detest  Take then some culinary Fair  Nor seek a Star beyond your Sphere  How cou'd you hope to meet Success  Unskill'd in Breeding or Address  Unbless'd with Eloquence to move  The melting Soul to mutual Love  Your Lodgings Gold and Wine three Doz'n  I scorn'd and eke to call you Cousin  And cou'dst thou dull Impostor think  To purchase me with Gold or Drink  Yet still in Principles 'tis known  We judge of others by our own  And I excuse the fordid Thought  In thee whose Soul is to be bought  Thy licens'd Tongue the Law may murther  But prithee mangle me no further  For tho' my Colours are too faint  Such glaring Crimes as thine to paint  Yet I sometimes in Black and White  Can draw a Knave's Resemblance right  Thy Envy then and Rage give over  Thou worthless mean rejected Lover  Or in a Print I swear to shew you  So like that all Mankind shall know you  This did not happen to silence the Fel∣low who now carried his Impudence so far as to declare to all the Lawyers at the  Rose  Club that I made Love to him so recollecting a Story his Nephew who was married to my Sister had related to me of a vile Use to which he adapted three large Folio Volumes of his Uncle's Philosophy I wrote the following Ballad and pacquetted Mr  Tffe  with it at a Time I knew several Lawyers would be assembled at the Tavern aforementioned and threatened Mr  Tffe  if he did not read it out for the Amusement of the Company he should be my next Subject for Satyr but no body so earnestly insisted on seeing the Song as  Cn  himself To oblige him and entertain the Company  Mr  Tffe  sung it to the Tune of  Chevy Chace  YE Sons of Science mourn with me  In sad and doleful Strains  The Loss which fair Philosophy  And Literature sustains  Three Volumes of enormus Size  O  Cn  had penn'd  And lent them for to make him wise  To an ingenious Friend  Who on the puzzling Pages por'd  Three livelong Summer Days  But cou'd not understand one Word  For so my Author says  He thro' the palpable obscure  Grop'd out his uncouth Way  Where neither Truth nor Reason pure  Had shed one Friendly Ray  In  Newton Bacon Locke  and  Boyle  He found celestial Light  Whose sacred Beams o'erpaid his Toil  But here reign'd deepest Night  In fam'd  Laputa  's floating Isle  As  Gulliver  has taught  They swallow Learning like a Pill  Without Expence of Thought  This Way he try'd but all in vain  Those Writings ne'er ascend  They Gravitation's Laws maintain  And to the Center tend  Enrag'd to find all Methods fail  These Works he surely said  May be adapted to the Tail  Tho' never to the Head  These  Sybil  Leaves Oh Spight and Shame  In Pieces torn he takes  And wip'd a Part not fit to name  And plung'd them in a Jakes  Wake  Cn  thy noble Heart  Explore that hoary Deep  Nor suffer thine immortal Part  In Silence there to sleep  Or on the Orifice all Day  Thy nether End expose  By whose inspiring Fumes you may  New Systems yet compose  Henceforth be scorn'd great  Maro  's Tomb  And eke the  Delphic  Shrine  For that fam'd PrivyHouse whose Womb  Contains thy Works divine  I have been credibly informed that this Song made  Cn  blush which was more than any thing had ever done before How∣ever he took a Copy of it which he pro∣mised to publish but finding he has not been as good as his Word I must even be at the Expence of doing it my self  But to return Mr  Wle  came to me and told me he had been so unfortunate to disoblige a Lady of Distinction for not be∣ing apprized that she understood  French  and being asked in that Language how he liked her he said she was an indifferent Pic∣ture of her Sister But he easily perceived by an Alteration in her Countenance that  she too well understood him and that he was out of Hope of obtaining her Pardon unless something pretty could be wrote upon the Subject by way of Apology so I raised his Spirits in about half an Hour after by sending him the following Lines  To Miss  PLKETT  A Thousand diff'rent Arts I try'd  To vary  Celia  's Face  And at each Alteration spy'd  Some new resistless Grace  Now chearful Mirth with gay Delight  Shines in her Eyes confess'd  Now Sorrow clouds their beamy Light  And heaves her snowy Breast  Each diff'rent Turn of Mirth or Spleen  Still gave the Maid new Charms  Anger alone remain'd unseen  Which ev'ry Nymph disarms  Fair one can you forgive the Art  Which did your Wrath provoke  Alas far distant from my Heart  Was that rash Word I spoke  And know this Passion only shew'd  New Graces to my Sight  Your Cheeks with brighter Beauties glow'd  Your Eyes flash'd keener Light  Like  Semele  's my daring Aim  Wou'd on  Jove  's Lightning gaze  But sunk amidst the fatal Flame  And perish'd in the Blaze  In the Evening Mr  Wle  returned and told me the Lines had made up all Matters that the other young Lady said she wished he had affronted her so he had made her such a pretty Apology  'I must beg of you now said he to improve that Hint and write me some Lines for her Sister'  I readily writ for him these  To Miss  BETTY PLKETT  WHY Fair one shouldst thou wish thy Friend  Thy matchless Sweetness to offend  Alas thy Beauty need not use  This Method to engage his Muse  Since nought could keep her mute so long  But Fear thy Loveliness to wrong  When other Nymphs my Song require  And bid me strike the sounding Lyre  To gratify the vainest she  I tell her she resembles thee  But not a Bard since  Milton  's Days  However elegant in Praise  Possess'd that Dignity of Thought  To draw an Angel as he ought  The Lines had the desired Effect and both the Ladies were reconciled to the sup∣posed Author  My next Task being a charitable one I could by no means refuse which was to write the following Prologue for the Bene∣fit of a distressed Person in Jail  A PROLOGUE spoke at the THEATRE in  SmockAlley  THIS Land for Learning and Re∣ligion fam'd  In antient Times the  Isle of Saints  was nam'd  And Heav'nborn Charity prime Grace once more  Shall this bless'd Title to its Sons restore  A fitter Object Pity ne'er cou'd find  For this divinest Virtue of the Mind  Than honest Industry and Worth distress'd  And suff'ring Innocence by Fraud oppress'd  By paleey'd Wa  t and sallow Sickness pin'd  Within a Prison's dismal Gloom confin'd  Where everlasting Sighs and Anguish reign  And each sad Moment seems an Age of Pain  'Tis yours to raise him from his dreadful Care  To soften Anguish and remove Despair  The Great and Pious in the Task combine  And glorious emulate the Power Divine  Mercy her white Celestial Wings displays  And to the Throne of Grace your Zeal con∣veys  Whence thick as Dew from Heav'n shall Joys descend  And endless Blessings on your Race attend  Mr  We  now began to make some Figure and tho' he kept me pretty fully employed he drove an underhand Trade with Mr  Pn  And as he was not willing that either of us should believe him incapable of Writing he used to shew Mr  Pn  's Work to me and swear it was his own and in return he with the same modest Assurance presented mine to him but we were too well acquainted with each other's Stile to be deceived At last Mr  Pn  not satisfied with all the Ex∣pence he put him to in  London  made a Demand on him for fifty Pounds but as Mr  Pn  had before made the best Penny of me to him he possibly could and  Wle  finding what I wrote passed every Jot as well his he thought it most convenient if he did disburse any thing to give it to me as thinking I most wanted it so I was now full of Poetical Business  by which my Poverty was relieved and my Mind amused  Mr  Pn  was so vexed at losing his Chap that in Revenge he endeavoured to insinuate that we conversed unlawfully to∣gether but this met no Credit as I very seldom saw him and never alone  In the mean time he carried on a vigorous Prosecution against me in the Spiritual Court in which I gave him no opposition as he solemnly declared he would always allow me a Maintenance to the utmost of his Ability and to live with him I by no means desired  For never cou'd true Reconcilement spring  Where Wounds of deadly Hate so deep were fix'd  But no sooner had he obtained a Separa∣tion from me but he retracted every Word he had said not only refusing to give me any Assistance but also abusing me in the most unchristian false and scandalous manner and publickly triumphed in hav∣ing overreached me Upon this I was  advised to lodge an Appeal against him which made him quite mad He abused his Advocate Proctor and the Judge himself as all doing him Injustice and tho' I knew none of them insisted on it they were Confederates with me against him  But this outragious manner of Proceed∣ing rather injured himself than me the Delegates were appointed and as every body whom he consulted assured him he would be cast his haughty Spirit was will∣ing to capitulate but nobody would un∣dertake to deliver his Message to me least he should scandalize them for it so at length with great Entreaty he prevailed on  Wle  to make a Proposal from him to me of giving me a small Annuity and thirty Pounds in Money which in regard to my Children I rather chose to accept of than ruin their Father as I certainly had it in my power to do  Wle  who has really a good deal of Humour came to me one Morning after my being a Week without seeing him and in a Theatrical manner delivered the following Speech  Before I speak the Message of the Priest first give me leave to glory in the Title of his Ambassador  I wondered what odd Whim had now taken  Wle  and begged he would deliver himself like a Man of this World  He then related the Proposal afore∣mentioned on which I desired two Days time to consider and then acquiesced and withdrew the Appeal like an easy Fool as I was  Dearly have I since repented it as no Articles of the Agreement were kept altho' I thought they were as strongly assured to me as the Law could make them in which there are so many Loopholes that even Persons conversant with it may be de∣ceived how then should a Female be sufficiently on her Guard against the Pro∣fessors of a kind of unintelligible Jargon whose Skill is to puzzle the Cause or a Science where  Endless Tautologies and Doubts perplex  Too harsh a Study for our softer Sex  Of the Thirty Pounds I never received but Fifteen and those Mr  Wle  as∣sured me he advanced out of his own Pocket and never was paid as I can prove under his own Hand  But Heav'n knows as I had every thing to provide for a Child and myself and Rent also to pay this Sum lasted not long especially as I had no Friend near meNo nor any honest Person for my Landlady of whom before I had conceived a good Opinion when she found I was in Labour insisted either on my paying double the Rent I had engaged for or quitting her House which as it was then too late for me to do I was necessitated to comply with her exorbitant Demand which made her very complaisant  Before I had received even this small Re∣lief I wrote to many Ladies to whom my Father had been Physician and who once seemed to be my Friends but to no pur∣pose their constant Answer was that I deserved nothing to which general Rule I never met with but two Exceptions  I wrote also to the Bp of  C  who after long Deliberation picked out of his Purse half a Piece which extraordinary Bounty he by the Force of Imagination doubled and also declared that I had sent to him for it a Woman who had been whipt thro' the Town who as she really was a Gentlewoman of good Character but of low Fortune had it not been for my Persuasion to the contrary would have sued his Lp for Defamation  But as he was so kind to give my Son who is his Godson Five Shillings in small Change in  London  which he told the Youth was a Crown Piece who knowing there was such a Coin as a Five Shilling Piece of Gold searched amongst the Half∣pence narrowly to find it tho' without Success I think I must pardon him espe∣cially as on my threatning to expose him since I came to  Ireland  he to bribe me to Secrecy sent me one Pound a remark∣able and unaccountable Charity from his Lordship to any Person of whom he had not Carnal Knowledge  And tho' in a Letter of his he assures me he desires no public Praise for what he has done and makes as long and learned a Disquisition between the Law of our Mem∣bers and the Law of our Minds as he once did between  Graminervous  and  Carniverous  which as I do not understand  Latin  I may very possibly mispel tho' their Signi∣fication is I believe Grass or Flesh de∣vouring Animals of the later of which I believe his Lp would make the best Meal The antient Priests were never permitted to burn Flesh but as a Sacrifice to the Almighty but it is reported that one of them turning a Stake when it was a little too hot burned his Finger on which he licked it and found it so savory that he devoured that part which was intended for the Gods and as the Laity beheld him to their Opinion breaking the Law in eating Flesh he assured them that he had an immediate Revelation that it was lawful for him to eat the prime Part of the Flesh and leave the Garbage for the Laity Thus we may see how early Priestcraft began from the very first they were Flesh∣mongers  and Priests of all Religions are the same Those who want to look farther into the Deceits of Priesthood may trace it up even to the  Nile  from whence Su∣perstition and the Crocodile first sprung both alike destructive to Mankind  It is known to every learned Divine that the Priests engrossed the whole Country of  Egypt  as the eldest Son of every Priest was born a Priest and was therefore in∣titled to a tenth part of the Land upon which  Joseph  who was not only an admir∣able Man but an excellent Politician and had a Divine Revelation that the Land should suffer Famine ten Years ordered the Priests to pay in all their Subsidies to the King whereby in those ten Years of Dearth the King purchased at so low a Rate as giving the People a little Corn all the Lands in  Egypt  These are Remarks of the ad∣mirable Lord  Shaftsbury  whose inimitable Style and clear Manner of Reasoning carry Conviction with them  I never knew any Clergyman who quoted him but to his Prejudice except Dr  Turn∣bull  And yet I cannot see why Morality  or the Preaching of it should in any wise be offensive to a Christian since there is a certain Beauty in Holiness which tho' it were never to be hereafter rewarded gives a sincere Satisfaction and Quietude of Mind in this LifeAnd therefore Virtue does still  With Scorn the mercenary World regard  Where sordid Minds do Good and hope Reward  Above the worthless Trophies Men can raise  She seeks not Honour Fame or empty Praise  But with herself herself the Goddess pays  All I would infer from this rambling Di∣gression is  That Authority tho' it errs like other  Bears yet a kind of Medicine in itself  To skin the Sore on the Top  And that Subtilty and Avarice have been almost inseparable from the Priesthood ever since the World began  But to return Having at length passed the Pain and Peril of Childbirth by the Care and Humanity of Dr  Arbuckle  I was in great Distress It is true Mr  Pn  kindly advised me to leave my Child which was a Female one upon the Parish and as he would willingly have done the same or worse to those whose Legitimacy he never questioned I had the less Reason to blame him but such a Piece of Inhumani∣ty I from Soul abhorred nor could any thing prevail on me to put it in practice  Mr  Wle  went to  Mallow  where at his Request I sent to him the following Poems  The HAPPY PAIR A BALLAD  AT dewy Dawn  As o'er the Lawn  Young  Roger  early stray'd  He chanc'd to meet  With  Jenny  sweet  The blooming Country Maid  Her Cheeks so red  With Blushes spread  Shew'd like the breaking Day  Her modest Look  The Shepherd took  She stole his Heart away  With tender Air  He woo'd the Fair  And movingly addrest  For Love divine  Can Clowns refine  And warm the coldest Breast  Her Eyes he prais'd  And fondly gaz'd  On her inchanting Face  Where Innocence  And Health dispense  Each winning rosy Grace  Young  Jenny  's Breast  Love's Pow'r confess'd  And felt an equal Fire  Nor had she Art  To hide her Smart  Or check the soft Desire  Hymen  unites  In blissful Rites  The fair the matchless two  And Wedlock ne'er  Could boast a Pair  More lovely or more true  Ye Rich and Great  How seldom Fate  Gives you so mild a Doom  Whose wand'ring Flames  And wanton Dames  A mutual Plague become  While Coach and Six  Your Passion fix  You buy your State too dearly  Ah courtly Folks  You're but the Jokes  Of those who love sincerely  MALLOW  WATERS  Written for Mr  Wle  who was chosen Poet Laureat to the Honourable Society of Ladies and Gentlemen erected there  NOT fam'd  Pieria  's hallow'd Spring  Near which the sacred Sisters sing  Could more deserve the Poet's Lays  His softest Song his choicest Praise  Than  Mallow  's sweet inspiring Stream  The Source of Health the Muse's Theme  Thy Draughts  Nepenthe  like remove  All Sorrows but the Pains of Love  And on thy Banks such Nymphs appear  That none escape that Passion here  While Art in vain attempts to shew  Their Features and celestial Glow  Thy smooth expanded liquid Glass  Lively reflects each beauteous Face  And shews them that transcendent Bloom  Which from thy Bounty they assume  If all be true which Poets dream  There dwells a Nymph in ev'ry Stream  Sweet  Naiad  that inhabit'st here  In crisped Brook or Fountain clear  O teach me in exalted Verse  The matchless Charmers to rehearse  And as you gently glide along  To distant Fields convey my Song  First sing our Queen sublimely grac'd  With Breeding Elegance and Taste  And  Blaney  with each Charm replete  Which decks the Worthy or the Great  In  Dunscomb  's faultless Form and Mind  A thousand winning Charms we find  And graceful  Bond  whose easy Air  Bespeaks the unaffected Fair  O  Lysaught  such a Form as thine  In  Homer  's deathless Lays should shine  Since he who  Helen  's Beauties drew  Alone can give thy Charms their due  From thee I turn my dazzl'd Sight  And lo where radiant  Plunkett  bright  As Noontide Sun in Summer Skies  Wounds with new Light my aking Eyes  Ah  Mallow  what avail thy Shades  If tyrant Love their Peace invades  Not all thy Groves and wooded Hills  Thy cooling Streams or healing Rills  Can guard us from his piercing Rays  Or give the burning Anguish Ease  Thy Waters quench each meaner Fire  But make this Heav'nborn Flame mount high'r  In  Jepson  's blooming Form we meet  The Gay the Sprightly and the Sweet  While  Smith  with Virgin Beauty crown'd  Shall with her Sisters be renown'd  Thro' Time and leave a deathless Name  Fair as their virtuous Mothers Fame  Not  Philomel  's melodious Throat  Can equal  Brusted  's warbled Note  Soft  Syren  whose enchanting Strains  Fetter the prison'd Soul in Chains  With Rapture on the Dance we gaze  When  Purcell  swims th' harmonious Maze  How many Charmers yet remain  Well worthy the sublimest Strain  What Hearts unnumber'd shall be won  By  Colthurst Harper Knap  and  Dun  And thou agreeable  Codroy  The noblest Poet might'st employ  What blooming Beauties smile around  Thick as the Flow'rets paint the Ground  When warmer Suns and genial Rain  Make them to deck the verdant Plain  Thick as the Stars their Beams display  Which join to form the Milky Way  Ah fair ones Language is too faint  The Graces ye possess to paint  Happy if my aspiring Strain  Your judging Ears may entertain  The Verse believe me is well meant  However short of the Intent  Smile then on my ambitious Aim  And give your Poet endless Fame  A  SONG  LYING is an Occupation  Us'd by all who mean to rise  Politicians owe their Station  But to well concerted Lyes  These to Lovers give Assistance  To insnare the Fair one's Heart  And the Virgin's best Resistance  Yields to this commanding Art  Study this superior Science  Would you rise in Church or State  Bid to Truth a bold Defiance  'Tis the Practice of the Great  In Return he sent me the following Lines which he assured me were his own  VERSES to Mrs  Pn  on seeing a Poem inscribed to her the Season she was at  Mallow  in the Lines  If  Sappho  lends a gracious Smile  Be damn'd all Critics of our Isle  The Royal Stamp is on those Lays  Which second  Dacier  deigns to praise  Propitious then attend my Call  My Muse my Goddess and my All  Mr  Wle  to Mrs  Pn  THOU azure Fount whose chrystal Stream  Was once a nobler Poet's Theme  While to inspire the tuneful Strain  Sappho  was call'd nor call'd in vain  Ah let the World forgive if here  I pay the Tribute of a T  r  In friendly Grief at  Sappho  's Fate  The Wonder of thy Banks so late  So many Virtues were thy Share  Thou most accomplish'd ruin'd Fair  One Error sure may be forgiv'n  And Pardon find from Earth and Heav'n  That sov'reign Pow'r who fram'd us all  Suffer'd the Sons of Light to fall  And oft to humble human Pride  From Virtue lets the wisest slide  Ye Fair no more her Fault proclaim  For your own Sakes conceal her Shame  Since if a Nymph so good could fail  We well may think your Sex are frail  Who wrote those Lines I know not but as I am certain the Author need not blush to acknowledge them I hope he will not only pardon my Vanity in making them public but also subscribe to my Writings  I can only assure the World I believe Mr  Wle  never wrote a poetical Line in his Life and therefore I am indebted to some humane and ingenuous Person who supposing me guilty makes an almost di∣vine Apology for me  But as it was impossible for me to subsist meerly on Praise I made one strong Effort  to deliver myself out of Calamity which was to beg Mr  Pn  to send me some Money to bear my Expences to  London  assuring him I was weary of  Ireland  which indeed was true for I am of the same O∣pinion with the pleasant Lady  Dorchester  that  Dublin  is a Place of the least Sin and the most Scandal of any City in the World  Perhaps the Reverse would have better pleased her as the Lord Chief Justice says to  Falstaff  Ld Ch Just  Your Waist Sir  John  is very great and your Means very slender  Falst  Wou'd it were otherwise my Lord that my Means were greater and my Waist slenderer  This Text wants no Comment  But if my learned Husband will oblige me with one I shall be his very humble Servant He has threatened to give a true and impartial Narrative of my Proceedings to the Public and I wonder why he who rides so fast has not got the Whiphand  of me I fear his Appeal comes half an Hour too late  But Courage my Spouse tho' it cannot be said  That on  cloven Tongue ever sat on your Head  I'll hold you a Groat and I wish I could see't  If your Stockings were off you could shew cloven Feet  I am a sad digressive Writer by which my Readers may plainly perceive I am no Methodist  Mr  Pn  agreed to my Proposal and as he was fully determined never to give me any more sent me nine Pounds for which as he said he sold my Diamond Ring to Mrs  Dubourg  and the Chain of my Watch which cost six Guineas to Mrs  Wrrn  for the Promise of forty Shil∣lings for which I suppose Mr  Pn  and she have since accounted A goodna∣tured Man will easily be satisfied with a  Lady that will return him a Toy for a Trinket  Nothing that ever she got vexed me so much as Mr  Pn  's giving her my Fa∣ther's Snuffbox which he borrowed from me under Pretence that taking a little Snuff preserved him from catching Sickness in Places he was obliged to go to He de∣clared to me he had lost it but I after∣wards saw it with her as also several other Things belonging to me  But he is not the first Man who has plun∣dered his Wife to oblige his As this Lady was I may say the principal Cause of a Separation between the Parson and me I thought I had a Right to de∣mand a Subscription from her which since my Return to  Ireland  I did in very civil Terms And I think myself in Duty bound to give my learned Readers a Taste of her excellent Style in answer to me  WHOOSOMDEVER yow aree I aboar yow and yowr Filthy Idy∣ous I submit my Cows to the Devil and  fear nout hiss Enemoys whileoust I a  undder hiss Preteckshon As to the Par¦son yow metown tis wile nowne what he  iss he ruinged my Sun by his Ungrait¦fullnesse It is not in your Power to defa¦matonous my Corector in your wild Mem¦boirs So I am wythh harti Prawours fo  yowr speedi Deformation  Yours  I really took great Pains to find out th  Meaning of this elaborate Epistle what i  is future Critics who are better skilled i  broken  English  may decide But I do as∣sure the Public it is genuine which if they doubt I can produce it in the Lady's own Scrawl This Lady sent a Captain of a Ship to me when she heard I was going for  England  to hurry me out of the King∣dom which Circumstance made me stay in it six Months longer than I intended And having not yet done with her I can∣not forbear remarking that one  Lty  a Painter a rude Fellow a few Nights after my Separation from the Parson took the  Liberty on not readily finding him in his own House of breaking open his Bedchamber Door to which the Maid pointed where the Lady and Gentleman were ad∣ministering Christian Consolation to each other Illbred as he was when he found how Matters were he begged Pardon for spoiling Sport  'But Parson said he I did but follow your own Example'  So he retired without drinking though invited Share of the Punch of which stood a large Bowl before them but Gold can work Miracles  Make Base Noble Old Young Cowards valiant  Ha this ye Gods will lug your Priests and Servants from your Sides  This yellow Slave  Will knit and break Religions bless the Accurst  Make the hoary Leprosy ador'd  This it is that makes the wappen'd Widow wed again  She whom the Spital House and ulcerous Sores  Would cast the Gorge at this embalms and spices  To th'  April  Days again  But I suppose this Widow was willing to have a Taste before Matrimony And I am certain Mr  Pn  could not possibly have any other Motive for liking this Wo∣man but merely that she was rich  I still continued scribbling for Mr  Wle  to whom I sent to  Mallow  the following Poems on several Occasions as he demanded them  A  SONG  Set to Musick by Mr  ARNE  TO melancholy Thoughts a Prey  With Love and Grief opprest  To Peace a Stranger all the Day  And all the Night to Rest  For thee disdainful Fair I pine  And wake the tender Sigh  By that obdurate Heart of thine  My balmy Blessings fly  O look to yon celestial Sphere  Where Souls in Rapture glow  And dread to want that Mercy there  Which you refus'd below  A  SONG  SOME for their Forms I have desir'd  And others for their Wit admir'd  Yet Fair one I can truly vow  I never never lov'd till now  No Language can describe the Pain  Which in your Absence I sustain  Or paint the rapturous Delight  Which swells my Bosom at your Sight  So when the golden Sun declines  Sad  Heliotrope  her Head declines  But quickens with his vital Ray  And spreads her Beauties to the Day  To a  LADY  who defended the Author's Character  WHILE other Females trifle Life away  In Dress and Scandal Equipage and Play  Stella  with Sense exalted and refin'd  And each superior Grace adorns her Mind  There Friendship Honour Truth and Vir∣tue live  With all the Charms that Art or Nature give  O how shall Words my Tenderness im∣part  Or speak the Dictates of a grateful Heart  To thee fair Patroness who could'st de∣scend  My Character thus nobly to defend  Who would not wish to have sustain'd a Wrong  To have their Cause supported by thy Tongue  So disappointed Malice drops its Aim  And what was meant to sink exalts my Fame  The  WISHES  A Song  O Love by thy almighty Pow'r  Transform me to that newblown Flow'r  Which fram'd for Sweetness and Delight  Attracts my lov'd  Almeria  's Sight  Behold in vernal Beauty drest  It decks the lovely Virgin's Breast  Whence it superior Grace assumes  And with unrival'd Beauty blooms  Why am I not that gentle Air  Which flutters fans and cools the Fair  Too happy Zephyr balmy Gale  That Fragrance from her Breath you steal  See while your Pain you softly sigh  And on her snowy Bosom die  Thy Goddess  Flora  jealous grows  And with divine Resentment glows  Why am I not that Bird whose Note  Sweet warbling in his liquid Throat  Bids ev'ry Grove and Vale rejoice  His tender soft melodious Voice  Nightly with his enchanting Strain  Does in the Woods my Love detain  Ti  l list'ning she forgets to fear  The Dangers that may threaten there  When  Phoebus  darts direct his Beams  Almeria  seeks the cooling Streams  The RiverGod with Pride receives  Almeria  to his azure Waves  With murm'ring Joy they round her move  And take her for the Queen of Love  Ye Gods were I that happy Stream  How should my fierce my rapid Flame  Pardon thou bright thou matchless Fair  The bold Presumption of my Pray'r  Gladly would I my Being change  Gladly from Form to Form I'd range  Might I in any Shape delight  Almeria  's Sense or please her Sight  Or might those Variations prove  The Truth of my unalter'd Love  These and fifty others of which I have no Copy did this Gentleman get from me almost for nothing  In the mean time having received an un∣expected Bounty from a Gentleman of very high Rank and distinguished Honour I wrote to him the following Lines  To the Honourable Mr ****  ADMIRE not if the grateful Muse  With fond Affection still pursues  Thee Pride and Glory of a Race  Whom ev'ry Muse and Science grace  They in thy gen'rous Bosom shine  And lighten from thy Eyes divine  Thus raptur'd I the Strain essay'd  And begg'd  Apollo  's pow'rful Aid  The angry God in Rage reply'd  Go check thy Insolence and Pride  Not that I blame thy happy Choice  But 'tis too lofty for thy Voice  Who pine like thee with Want oppress'd  Forsaken comfortless distress'd  In vain attempt sublimer Lays  The beauteous Work of Minds at Ease  What tho' in early Hours of Life  'Ere yet a Mother or a Wife  I tun'd thy infant Voice to sing  And plac'd thee near my hallow'd Spring  My fav'rite  Swift  thy Numbers prais'd  Cou'd mortal Worth be higher rais'd  Yet I'll no more thy Wants supply  Since Fortune leaves you so will I  Thy Laurel Chaplet now resign  Let mournful Yew and Cypress twine  Around thy melancholy Head  'Till thou art number'd with the Dead  Nor dare to let thy Female Pen  Profane the first and best of Men  As well when with Meridian Rays  I give the Summer Noontide Blaze  Might'st thou expect to add new Light  To Beams intolerably bright  As hope to heighten ****'s Fame  Or add new Lustre to his Name  Whate'er adorns the Wise and Good  By him is truly understood  Nor lives he for himself alone  But Humankind his Bounty own  Convinc'd abash'd I drop'd my Suit  Wonder and Sorrow held me mute  Yet tho' I wake the String no more  Silent thy Virtues I adore  O let thy just superior Sense  Forgive this last this fond Offence  Led by Despair the Hand of Death  Must quickly stop this vital Breath  His fatal Pow'r alone can part  Thy Image from my grateful Heart  At the Gentleman's own Request I omit his Name but when I say he is the elder Brother of the greatest Man in this King∣dom he may perhaps be guessed at  This worthy Gentleman soon afterwards fell sick on which I sent him the following  Invocation to  HEALTH  THOU rosy Goddess of the Plains  Where Innocence thy Sister reigns  If Goodness can deserve thy Care  To Godlike ****'s Couch repair  Let him thy matchless Charms enjoy  What Nymph to **** can be coy  Nor shou'd thy Favours be deny'd  To him who spreads thy Empire wide  When Want and all her gloomy Train  Pining Disease and racking Pain  On poor afflicted Mortals prey  His Bounty drives those Ills away  Swift as the Shadows wing their Flight  Before the purple dawning Light  Come youngey'd Maid serenely gay  With healing Looks and Breath of  May    His Virtues to our Wishes give  And guard that Life by whom we live  Mr  Wle  had the Conscience to write to me to desire I would by the Re∣turn of the Post send him a hundred Bal∣lads of my own Composition as he had al∣ready begun to take in Subscriptions for them and on the Receipt of them he would order a Gentleman to pay me two Guineas I suppose he thought I could write as fast as the Poet whom  Horace  de∣scribes standing on one Leg while he wrote a thousand Lines And because I was un∣able to comply with this Request he sent me the following most strange Epistle  To Mrs  PN  DN you sink you Gd fire you I have beggared myself be∣tween your scoundrel Husband and you all to support a little dirty Vanity When I want any thing from him his dned Spirits are sunk Nor has he given me any think worth a Farthing for the mon∣strous Sums he has drawn out of me I could write before I ever saw either of your ugly Faces tho' not quite so welland dn me if I ever write another Line of VerseYou understand meI shall be in Town so as to meet the Pt The Eyes of all  Europe  are on me and dn me if you do not send me the Ballads but I will despise and defy you for ever  Yours J W  P S  By G I cannot stir out for my Landlady has beat me through the Town with a hot Shoulder of Mut∣ton which she snatched from the Fire Spit and all only for catching me a little familiar with her Daughter  I concluded by this Letter that the poor Man's Head was turned and therefore thought it not worth answering being now seriously determined to leave  Ireland  for though I led the Life of a Recluse I had every Day some new Story invented of me If I went out to take a little Air they said I had great Impudence to shew my Face and if I staid at Home I was then in Keep∣ing with some Man who confined me and in short I could please nobody Which gave rise to the following Lines  EXPOSTULATION  O God since all thy Ways are just  Why does thy heavy Hand  So sore afflict the wretched Dust  Thou didst to Life command  Thou speak'st the Word the senseless Clay  Was quick'ned with thy Breath  Chearless to view the Beams of Day  And seek the Shades of Death  Thro' ev'ry Scene of Life distress'd  As Daughter Mother Wife  When wilt thou close my Eyes in Rest  And take my weary Life  To the past present and to come  Are evermore the same  Thou knew'st of all my Woes the Sum  'Ere I my Thoughts cou'd frame  'Twas thou gav'st Passion to my Soul  And Reason also gave  Why didst thou not make Reason rule  And Passion be its Slave  O pardon me thou Pow'r Divine  That thus I dare presume  At thy Correction to repine  Or murmur at my Doom  Lord give me Penitence sincere  For ev'ry Error past  And tho' my Trials are severe  O give me Peace at last  So these were the last Strains I sung in  Ireland  which illused as I was in it I could not quit without very great Regret and as the Coach drove by Mr  Pn  's Door I thought my very Heart would split with Sorrow for there indeed was all the Treasure of my Soul enclosed namely my dear little ones Many a Sigh and Tear they cost me many a Prayer did I offer up to the Almighty for their Preservation and had he not been an infinitely more gra∣cious Father to them than their earthly one proved long long ago had they been finally lost  My Eyes even after I went on board the Yatch were evermore turned to the Shore of  Ireland  resting there as on their last Period till finding myself observed and that some of the Passengers Colonel  Dalway  in particular wanted to see my  Face which I concealed I pretended to be Seasick and desired the Steward to shew me a Cabin  He left me for a few Minutes and re∣turning told me all the Beds were en∣gaged but however there was a Gentle∣man on board who said he would sooner sit up than a Lady be unprovided for I returned my Compliments without ever so much as enquiring to whom I was obliged  The Sickness I feigned proved present∣ly true for no sooner was the Ship under Sail but I grew violently Seasick when the Steward once more entered the Cabin and told me the Gentleman to whom it belonged desired a Moment's Chat with me I begged him to make my Apology as indeed what with Sickness and Sorrow I was little in Temper to receive any Person  However the Gentleman resolved not to be so easily dismissed for following the Steward into my Cabin he told me he knew me to be Mrs  Pn  that he could not sit up all Night and therefore  he hoped I would not refuse him the Li∣berty of sleeping in his own Bed  I answered I would not provided he would be so kind as to leave me for a few Moments on which weak as I was I sprung out of Bed and as I had not un∣dressed myself soon met him upon Deck  Who this fame Gentleman was may in due Season be revealed I can only assure my Readers that I believe had I accepted of the Offers he made me Pover∣ty would never have approached me as he was a Man of Honour or at least ap∣peared to me as such A Man of Fortune he certainly is and I doubt not but he has enjoyed many a lovely Lady without promising them any Reward or offering them a Settlement for Life as he really did me  I dined with him at  Parkgate  and I hope Virtue will be rewarded for though I had but five Guineas in the World to carry me up to  London  I yet possessed Chastity enough to refuse fifty for a Night's Lodging and that too from a handsome wellbred Man whose Name if I should  insert all the World would acknowledge I spoke but Truth of him  I shall scarcely ever forget his Words to me as they seemed almost prophetic  'Well Madam said he you do not know  London  you will be undone there'  'Why Sir said I I hope you do not imagine I will go into any bad Course of Life'  'No Madam said he but I think you will sit in your Chamber and starve'  which upon my Word I have been pretty near doing and but that the Almighty raised me one worthy Friend good old Mr  Cibber  to whose Humanity I am under God indebted both for Liberty and Life I had been quite lost  I dare say nobody will imagine he served me from any carnal Views since  If Truth in Spite of Manners must be told  Why really Seventysix is something old  So here I close the First Volume and as it has been industriously and maliciously  reported that I had in reality nothing to publish I hope this will convince the World that Mrs  Pilkington  was never yet reduced to the Meanness of Falshood or Tricking And if this Volume meets with a favourable Reception I can assure my Readers the next will be infinitely more entertaining and is now ready for the Press  End of the FIRST VOLUME  In the Press and speedily will be Published VOL II of this WORK Which will conclude the Whole
