 CREÜSA Queen of ATHENS  A TRAGEDY  As it is Acted at the Theatre Royal in  Drurylane  By His MAJESTY's Servants  WRITTEN BY Mr WILLIAM WHITEHEAD  LONDON  Printed for R and J DODSLEY in  Pallmall  and Sold by M COOPER in  PeternosterRow    PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr ROSS  PROLOGUES of old the Learn'd in Language say  Were merely Introductions to the Play  Spoken by Gods or Ghosts or Men who knew  Whate'er was previous to the Scenes in view  And complaisantly came to lay before ye  The several Heads and Windings of the Story  But modern Times and  British  Rules are such  Our Bards beforehand must not tell too much  Nor dare we like the neighb'ring  French  admit  Ev'n Confidantes who might instruct the Pit  By asking Questions of the leading Few  And hearing Secrets which before they knew  Yet what we can to help this antique Piece  We will attemptOur Scene tonight is  Greece  And by the Magic of the Poet's Rod  This Stage the Temple of the  Delphic  God  Where Kings and Chiefs and Sages came of old  Like modern Fools to have their Fortunes told  And Monarchs were enthron'd or Nations freed  As an old Priest or wither'd Maid decreed  Yet think not all were equally deceiv'd  Some knew more doubted many more believ'd  In short these Oracles and witching Rhimes  Were but the pious Frauds of ancient Times  Wisely contriv'd to keep Mankind in awe  When Faith was Wonder and Religion Law  Thus much premis'd to every feeling Breast  We leave the Scenes themselves to tell the rest  Yet something sure was to the Critics said  Which I forgetsome Invocation made  Ye Critic Bands like jealous Guardians plac'd  To watch th' Encroachments on the Realms of Taste  From you our Author would two Boons obtain  Not wholly diffident nor wholly vain  Two things he asks 'tis modest sure from you  Who can do all things to request but two  First to his Scenes a kind Attention pay  Then judgewith Candor judgeand we obey  Persons Represented  XUTHUS King of  Athens  Mr BERRY

of the Temple of  Apollo  at  Del∣phi  and the Laurel Grove adjoining  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE  GEORGE BUSSY  Lord Visc VILLIERS The following TRAGEDY is inscribed by His Lordship's Most obliged and most affectionate humble Servant  W WHITEHEAD  Advertisement  THE Subject of the following Scenes is so ancient so slight∣ly mentioned by Historians and so fabulously treated by  Euripides  in his Tragedy of  Ion  that the Author thought himself at liberty to make the Story his own Some glaring Circumstances he was obliged to ad∣here to which he has endeavoured to render probable  CRĖU̇SA Queen of ATHENS A TRAGEDY  ACT I  The Vestibule of the Temple  ILYSSUS  and Virgins  ILYSSUS  HASTE haste ye Virgins round the Columns twine  Your flowery Chaplets and with Streams freshdrawn  Of  Castaly  bedew the sacred Porch  Of the great God of Day Already see  His orient Beam has reach'd the double Top  Of high  Parnassus  and begins to shed  A gleamy Lustre o'er the Laurel Grove  Haste haste ye Virgins From the Vale beneath  I hear the Noise of Chariots and of Steeds  Which hither bend their Course for every Sound  Seems nearer than the formerAnd behold  A reverend Stranger who perhaps proclaims  Th' Approach of some great Monarch to consult  Allseeing  Phoebus  or implore his Aid  Haste haste ye Virgins  Enter  PHORBAS  PHORBAS  Tell me gentle Maids  And thou fair Youth who seem'st to lead the Train  Is this the Temple of the  Delphic  God  ILYSSUS  It is and on the middle Point of Earth  Its firm Foundations by immortal Hands  Stand fix'dbut break we off the folded Gates  Unbar and lo the Priestess' self appears  The  Pythia  speaks as she descends from the Temple  PYTHIA  Hence ye profane nor with unhallow'd Step  Pollute the Threshold of the  Delian  King  Who slew the  Python  Say from whence thou art  And what thy Business Stranger  PHORBAS  Sacred Maid  From  Athens  am I come the Harbinger  Of great  Creusa  mine and  Athens'  Queen  PYTHIA  Comes she on pious Purpose to adore  The mystic Shrine oracular  PHORBAS  She does  And with her comes the Partner of her Bed  Aeolian Xuthus  he whose powerful Arm  Sav'd  Athens  from her Fate and in return  From good  Erectheus'  bounteous Hand receiv'd  His Daughter and his Crown  Half aside  Would he had found  Some other Recompence  PYTHIA  Overhearing him  Would he had found  Old Age is talkative and I may learn  Somewhat of moment from himWherefore come they  Does Famine threaten or widewasting Plague  Infest the Land  PHORBAS  Thank Heaven our crouded Streets  Have felt no dire Disease and Plenty still  Laughs in our blooming Fields Alas I fear  The childless Goddess who presides o'er  Athens  Has found a surer Method to declare  How ill she brooks that any Stranger Hand  Should wield th'  Athenian  Scepter  PYTHIA  Does from her  The Vengeance come  PHORBAS  I know not whence it comes  But this I know full fifteen Years have roll'd  Since first their Hands were join'd and roll'd in vain  For still the Royal Pair in Silence mourn  Curs'd with a barren Bed For this they come  T'explore the latent Cause and beg of Heav'n  To grant an Heir or teach them where to fix  On what selected Head th'  Athenian  Crown  PYTHIA  And Heaven no doubt will hear and grant their Prayer  Ilssus  haste and bid the Priests prepare  For Sacrifice You  Nysa  and your Sisters  Amid the Laurel Grove with Speed perform  The Morning's due Lustration  Then hither all returnMyself mean while  Aside  Will tempt the Vice of Age and try to draw  Aside  Some useful Secrets from him  Aside  The good King  Of whom you spake  Erectheus  did his People  Esteem and love him as they ought for Fame  Talk'd largely of his Worth He was a King  PHORBAS  He was my good old Master such a King  As Heaven but rarely sends Did we esteem  And love him dost thou ask O we ador'd him  He was our Father not our KingThese Tears  At least may speak  my  HeartWe must not hope  In these degenerate Times to see him equall'd  He never did an unkind Act but once  And then he thought the public Good requir'd it  Tho' much I fear the Evils we lament  From thence derive their Origin  PYTHIA  What Act  What unkind Act  PHORBAS  O Maid 'twere long to tell  The whole unhappy Story yet in part  Hear what to me appears too closely join'd  With these our present Ills There was a Youth  Athenian  born but not of Royal Blood  His Name  Nicander  him unlucky Fate  Had made the Lover of our present Queen  While yet a Maid What will not Love attempt  In young ambitious Minds he told his Pain  And won the Fair in secret to admit  And to return his Passion The good King  Was for a Time deceiv'd but found at last  Th' audacious Fraud and drove the guilty Youth  To Banishment perpetual Some say  'Twas by his Means he fell tho' that my Heart  Consents not to believe Thus much is sure  Nicander  wander'd forth a wretched Exile  And ere few Days had past upon the Road  Were found his wellknown Garments stain'd with Blood  Sure Sign of Murder and as sure a Sign  No needy Robber was the Instrument  PYTHIA  How bore  Creusa  this  PHORBAS  At first her Sorrows  Were loud and frantic Time at length subdued  Her Rage to silent Grief The good old King  To sooth her Woes consented she should raise  A Tomb to her  Nicander  and perform  A Kind of annual Rites to parted Love  PYTHIA  But that not long continued for we find  She married  Xuthus  PHORBAS  'Twas a Match of State  He sav'd her Country and she gave her Hand  Because that Country ask'd it But her Heart  Is buried with  Nicander  Still to him  And  Xuthus'  self permits it she performs  Her yearly Oft'rings and adorns with Flowers  An empty TombWould he had liv'd and reign'd  Her wedded Lord we had not wanted then  Th' Assistance of a Stranger Arm to guard  Th'  Athenian  State nor had we then been driven  To search for Heirs at  Delphi  PYTHIA  Stop thy Tongue  Or speak with Rev'rence of the sacred Shrine  Thy Words were hasty but thy Silence now  Makes just Atonement for themThen perhaps  Thou think'st this want of Heirs a Curse entail'd  By Heaven on  Athens  for  Nicander  's Death  And  Xuthus'  Reign  PHORBAS  I am  Athenian  born  Nor love  Aeolian  Kings however great  And good they may be  PYTHIA  The Imperial  Xuthus  Is much renown'd  PHORBAS  Is virtuous brave and pious  Perhaps too pious  PYTHIA  How  PHORBAS  Forgive me Maid  I speak my Thoughts with Freedom  PYTHIA  What thou speak'st  To me is sacred Then perchance thou rank'st  His Journey hither to address the God  Among those Acts which thou would'st call too pious  PHORBAS  For me the Gods of  Athens  would suffice  Yet do I pay just Rev'rence holy Maid  To thee and to thy Shrine  PYTHIA  Thy Zeal for  Athens  Is too intemperateBut the Train returns  And interrupts our Converse Say  Ilyssus  Are they prepar'd  Enter  ILYSSUS  and Virgins  ILYSSUS  They are and only wait  Th' approaching Victims  PYTHIA  By you Train the Queen  Is now on her Arrival Thou  Ilyssus  Receive her here while I as Custom wills  Deep in the Temple's inmost Gloom retire  And wait th' inspiring God  Ilyssus  hear  When thou hast paid due Honours to the Queen  Haste to  Aletes  in the Laurel Grove  Impatient I expect him tell him Youth  Things of uncommon Import do demand  His instant PresenceBut the Croud approaches  Stranger farewelI feel I feel within  An Heav'nborn Impulse and the Seeds of Truth  Are lab'ring in my BreastStranger farewel  The  Pythia  returns to the Temple and the Gates shut  Enter  CREUSA  and Attendants  CREUSA  No farther need we Conduct Bid the Guards  Return and wait the King  PHORBAS  Does ought of Moment  Detain him on the Road  CREUSA  He stops a while  great  Trophonius'  Cave that he may leave  Duty unperform'd Heaven grant his Zeal  May meet with just Success  ILYSSUS  Please you great Queen  In yon Pavilion to repose and taste  Some light Refection  CREUSA  Ha  Lycea    Phorbas  What Youth is this There's something in his Eyes  His Shape his VoiceWhat may we call thee Youth  ILYSSUS  The Servant of the God who guards this Fane  CREUSA  Bear'st thou no Name  ILYSSUS  Ilyssus  gracious Queen  The Priests and Virgins call me  CREUSA  Ha  Ilyssus  That Name's  Athenian  Tell me gentle Youth  Art thou of  Athens  then  ILYSSUS  I have no Country  Nor know I whence I am  CREUSA  Who where thy Parents  Thy Father Mother  ILYSSUS  Ever honor'd Queen  I never knew a Mother's tender Cares▪  Nor heard th' Instructions of a Father's Tongue  CREUSA  How cam'st thou hither  ILYSSUS  Eighteen Years are past  Since in the Temple's Portal I was found  A sleeping Infant  CREUSA  Eighteen Years good Heaven  That fatal Time recalls a Scene of Woe  Let me not thinkWere there no Marks to shew  From whom or whence thou wert  ILYSSUS  I have been told  An Osier Basket such as Shepherds weave  And a few scatter'd Leaves were all the Bed  And Cradle I could boast  CREUSA  Unhappy Child  But more O ten times more unhappy they  Who lost perhaps in thee their only Offspring  What Pangs what Anguish must the Mother feel  Compell'd no doubt by some disastrous Fate  But this is all Conjecture  ILYSSUS  O great Queen  Had those from whom I sprung been form'd like thee  Had they e'er felt the secret Pangs of Nature  They had not left me to the desart World  So totally expos'd I rather fear  I am the Child of Lowliness and Vice  And happy only in my Ignorance  Why should she weep O if her Tears can fall  For even a Stranger's but suspected Woes  How is that People blest where she presides  As Mother and as QueenPlease you retire  CREUSA  No stay Thy Sentiments at least bespeak  A gen'rous Education Tell me Youth  How has thy Mind been form'd  ILYSSUS  In that great Queen  I never wanted Parents The good Priests  And pious Priestess who with Care sustain'd  My helpless Infancy left not my Youth  Without Instruction But O more than all  The kindest best good Man a neighb'ring Sage  Who has known better Days tho' now retir'd  To a small Cottage on the Mountain's Brow  He deals his Blessings to the simple Swains  In Balms and powerful Herbs He taught me Things  Which my Soul treasures as its dearest Wealth  And will remember ever The good Priests  'Tis true had taught the same but not with half  That Force and Energy Conviction's self  Dwelt on  Aletes'  Tongue  CREUSA  Aletes  said'st thou  Was that the good Man's Name  ILYSSUS  It is great Queen  For yet he lives and guides me by his Counsels  CREUSA  What did he teach thee  ILYSSUS  To adore high Heaven  And venerate on Earth Heaven's Image Truth  To feel for others Woes and bear my own  With manly Resignation Yet I own  Some things he taught me which but ill agree  With my Condition here  CREUSA  What things were those  ILYSSUS  They were for Exercise and to confirm  My growing Strength And yet I often told him  The Exercise he taught resembled much  What I had heard of War He was himself  A Warrior once  CREUSA  And did those Sports delight thee  ILYSSUS  Great Queen I do confess my Soul mix'd with them  Whene'er I grasp'd the Osierplatted Shield  Or sent the mimic Javelin to its Mark  I felt I know not what of Manhood in me  But then I knew my Duty and repress'd  The swelling Ardor 'Tis to Shades I cried  The Servant of the Temple must confine  His less ambitious not less virtuous Cares  CREUSA  Did the good Man observe and blame thy Ardor  ILYSSUS  He only smil'd at my too forward Zeal  Nay seem'd to think such Sports were necessary  To soften what he call'd more rig'rous Studies  CREUSA  Why should she weep O if her Tears can fall  For even a Stranger's but suspected Woes  How is that People blest where she presides  As Mother and as QueenPlease you retire  CREUSA  No stay Thy Sentiments at least bespeak  A gen'rous Education Tell me Youth  How has thy Mind been form'd  ILYSSUS  In that great Queen  I never wanted Parents The good Priests  And pious Priestess who with Care sustain'd  My helpless Infancy left not my Youth  Without Instruction But O more than all  The kindest best good Man a neighb'ring Sage  Who has known better Days tho' now retir'd  To a small Cottage on the Mountain's Brow  He deals his Blessings to the simple Swains  In Balms and powerful Herbs He taught me Things  Which my Soul treasures as its dearest Wealth  And will remember ever The good Priests  'Tis true had taught the same but not with half  That Force and Energy Conviction's self  Dwelt on  Aletes'  Tongue  CREUSA  Aletes  said'st thou  Was that the good Man's Name  ILYSSUS  It is great Queen  For yet he lives and guides me by his Counsels  CREUSA  What did he teach thee  ILYSSUS  To adore high Heaven  And venerate on Earth Heaven's Image Truth  To feel for others Woes and bear my

at my too forward Zeal  Nay seem'd to think such Sports were necessary  To soften what he call'd more rig'rous Studies  CREUSA  Suppose when I return to  Athens  Youth  Thou should'st attend me thither would'st thou trust  To me thy future Fortunes  ILYSSUS  O most gladly  But then to leave these Shades where I was nurs'd  The Servant of the God how might that seem  And good  Aletes  too the kind old Man  Of whom I spake But wherefore talk I thus  You only throw these tempting Lures to try  Th' Ambition of my Youth Please you retire  CREUSA  Ilyssus  we will find a time to speak  More largely on this Subject for the present  Let all withdraw and leave us Youth farewel  I see the Place and will retire at leisure  Lycea Phorbas  stay  ILYSSUS  Aside  How my Heart beats  She must mean something sure Tho' good  Aletes  Has told me polished Courts abound in Falshood  But I will bear the Priestess' Message to him  And open all my Doubts  Exit  PHORBAS  Great Queen why stand'st thou silent something seems  To labour in thy Breast  CREUSA  Alas good  Phorbas  Didst thou observe that Youth When first my Eye  Glanc'd on his beauteous Form methought I saw  The Person of  Nicander  PHORBAS  Gracious Queen  Your Heart misleads your Eyes The Image there  Too deeply six'd makes every pleasing Object  Bear some Resemblance to itself  CREUSA  Lycea  And yet tho' thou wast there I well believe  Thy Youth can scarce remember how he look'd  When from the Fight triumphant he return'd  Grac'd with the victor Laurel such a Wreath  As now  Ilyssus  wears Indeed  Lycea  Thy Mother had she liv'd had thought as I do  Nay when he spake the Voice too was  Nicander  's  I know not what to think perhaps 'twas Fancy  Perhaps 'twas something more  PHORBAS  Illustrious Queen  You do abuse your noble Mind and lend  To mere illusions of the Brain the Force  And Power to make you wretched Grant there were  Some slight Resemblance of  Nicander  's Form  In young  Ilyssus  tho' my Eyes perceive not  Even the most distant Likeness grant there were  Yet wherefore should the Sight so nearly touch thee  Casual Similitude we know too well  Nicander  left no Heir  She seems disturbed  I say not this  Great Queen to heighten but relieve your Sorrows  And banish from your Breast each vain Surmise  Which Fancy might suggest  CREUSA  Too well indeed  O  Phorbas  much too well indeed we know  Nicander  left no Heir to his Perfections  No Image of himselfAnd yet good  Phorbas  Blame not my Folly nor demand a Reason  If I intreat thee to examine strictly  The Fortunes of this young Unknown The Priests  Or Priestess may know more than they entrust  To his unwary Youth The Sage he spake of  Could'st thou not search him out 'tis somewhere near  He dwells I think upon the Mountain's Brow  Thou wonder'st at me call it if thou please  A Woman's Weakness but obey me  Phorbas  PHORBAS  You say I wonder 'tis indeed to see  My honor'd Queen employ her Thoughts thus idly  On Griefs long past when things of dear Concern  To her and  Athens  should alarm her nearly  CREUSA  What things of near Concern  PHORBAS  See'st thou not Queen  Thy Crown  Erectheus'  Crown the Crown of  Athens  Wav'ring in Fortune's Power  CREUSA  The Gods will fix it  PHORBAS  The Gods Ah great  Creusa  may my Fears  Be vain and groundless but I fear the Gods  Have left us to ourselves When we resign'd  Th'  Athenian  Scepter to a Stranger Hand  We did reject their Guidance Wherefore come we  To  Delphi  now but that th' offended Gods  Have turn'd too long an inattentive Ear  To our illjudg'd Petitions  CREUSA  Why illjudg'd  We ask'd for Heirs  PHORBAS  We did for  Xuthus'  Heirs  The Race of  Aeolus  I know great Queen  They were to spring from thee but Heaven permits not  The native Pureness of th'  Athenian  Soil  Should mix with foreign Clay I wish we find not  More alien Kings at  Delphi  CREUSA  Think'st thou  Xuthus  Deceives us then His Worth his Piety  Forbid the Thought Besides the sacred Place  Admits not of Deceit  PHORBAS  Credulity  Is not the Vice of Age Forgive me Queen  If I suspect that Piety which brings us  To search for Kings at  Delphi  Might not  Athens  Have chosen her own Monarch Her brave Youth  Her bearded Sages are they not the Flower  And Pride of  Greece  Nay might'st not thou  Creusa  With liberal Hand bestow th' Imperial Wreath  And who has better Right  CREUSA  The Gods who gave it  To me and my great Ancestors  PHORBAS  Whate'er  The Gods bestow can never be resum'd  Tho' we repent The pious Populace  Will rev'rence Kings from Heaven  CREUSA  And wherefore not  PHORBAS  O Queen perhaps my Fears are too officious  But let thy Servant beg  CREUSA  I know thy Zeal  For me and for thy Country Rest assur'd  Creusa  never will consent to ought  Which can endanger  Athens  PHORBAS  My Heart thanks thee  CREUSA  Mean while the Youth  Ilyssus    PHORBAS  Should the King  Confirm'd by Oracles presume to fix  A Stranger on the Throne  CREUSA  He will not do it  PHORBAS  I hope he will not yet  CREUSA  The Youth I spake of  Wilt thou enquire  PHORBAS  Should  Xuthus  lay aside  His usual Mildness and assume at once  The Monarch and the Husband could'st thou then  CREUSA  In  Athens'  Cause I could resist them all  But cease these vain Suspicions A few Hours  Will prove thy Fears were groundless Meanwhile  Phorbas  Thou wilt find Methods to inform thyself  Touching this unknown Youth  PHORBAS  By yonder Guards  The King should be at hand  CREUSA  I will retire  To the Pavilion and expect him there  Yet hear me  Phorbas  let not  Xuthus  know  Why thou enquir'st  PHORBAS  Xuthus  has other Cares  CREUSA  The Priestess too I would confer with her  Tho' that  Lycea  may perform Farewel  And prosper in thy Task Alas  Lycea  Exit  Phorbas  There is a Secret labours in my Breast  But Fate forbids that I should give it Utterance  This boding Heart was early taught to feel  Too sensibly each distant Doubt alarms it  It starts at ShadowsBut retire we Maid  Grief is th' unhappy Charter of our Sex  The Gods who gave us readier Tears to shed  Gave us more Cause to shed them  Exeunt  The End of the First ACT  ACT II  The Laurel Grove  ALETES  and  ILYSSUS  ALETES  SEEM'D she disturb'd when she beheld thee  ILYSSUS  Much  And when I gave her the slight Hints I knew  Relating to my Fortunes she dissolv'd  In silent Tears such soft Humanity  Sure never dwelt in any Breast but hers  Nor did I think till now that I had Cause  Of Discontent but since she wept my Fate  I seem to find a Reason in her Grief  And feel myself unhappy  ALETES  Why unhappy  ILYSSUS  I know not why and yet to be confin'd  Thus to a single Spot to draw in Air  To take in Nourishment to live to die  For this was Man design'd Ah good  Aletes  Sure thou hast taught me Godlike Man was made  For nobler Purposes of general Good  For Action not for RestThe Queen propos'd  I should attend her to th'  Athenian  State  Would'st thou advise it Do'st thou think  Aletes  She meant I should attend her  ALETES  Doubtless Youth  If she propos'd she meant it  ILYSSUS  And would'st thou  Advise I should attend her  ALETES  Wherefore not  ILYSSUS  May I desert these Shades or can I leave  Thee thee my good  Aletes  ALETES  O  Ilyssus  Strive not to hide thy Heart from me thou can'st not  I form'd it and I know it  Delphi  's Shades  Have now no Peace for thee thy Bosom feels  Ambition's active unrelenting Fires  Thou wishest and thou hop'st thou know'st not what  'Tis Glory thou would'st have Go then brave Youth  Where Virtue calls thee be the Means but noble  Thou can'st not soar too high  ILYSSUS  My more than Father  Thy Words inspire me and I feel a Warmth  Unknown beforeBut then my Birth  ALETES  Thy Birth  Did I not early teach thee to despise  A casual Good Thou art thyself  Ilyssus  Inform me Youth would'st thou be what thou art  Thus fair thus brave thus sensibly alive  To Glory's finest Feel or give up all  To be descended from a Line of Kings  The tenth perhaps from  Jove  I see thy Cheek  Glows a repentant BlushOur greatest Heroes  Those Gods on Earth those Friends of Human kind  Whose great Examples I would set before thee  Were once unknown like thee And yet if Birth  Concern thee know prophetic is my Speech  Thy Fate is now at work and a few Hours  May show thee what thou artMy Words alarm thee  ILYSSUS  They do indeed O tell me  ALETES  'Tis in vain  Thou would'st enquire from me what Heaven conceals  Till its fit Time Didst thou not say  Ilyssus  Thy  Pythia  would be here  ILYSSUS  She comes  ALETES  Retire  And leave us to ourselves  ILYSSUS  I willAnd yet  Might I not know  ALETES  From me thou can'st know nothing  ILYSSUS  A few Hours said you  ALETES  Hence and beg of Heaven  To prosper the Event Retire and leave us  Exit  Ilyssus  Enter  PYTHIA  PYTHIA  Now good  Aletes  if thy pregnant Mind  Deep judging of Events has ever fram'd  Such artful Truths as won believing Man  To think them born of Heaven and made my Name  Renown'd in  Greece  O now exert thy Power  No common Cause demands it Kings and States  Are our Solicitors and  Athens'  Fate  Hangs on my Lips  ALETES  I know it well And now  If as thou say'st my secret kind Advice  And worn Experience in the Ways of Men  Have gain'd thy Altars Credit and with Gifts  Loaded thy Shrines now by one grateful Act  Thou may'st repay me all  PYTHIA  What Act O speak  And gladly I obey  ALETES  An Act my PYTHIA  Which tho' at first it may seem bold and dangerous  Shall in the End add Lustre to thy Shades  And make ev'n Kings Protectors of thy Fane  O  Pythia  'twas the Hand of Heaven itself  Which brought these Royal Suppliants to thy Shrine  I could unfold a TaleBut let it rest  Thou shalt ere Night know all and bless with me  Th' indulgent Powers above Only in this  Obey me blindly  Pythia  PYTHIA  Say in what  ALETES  Declare  Ilyssus  Heir to  Athens'  Crown  PYTHIA  Ilyssus  Heir what mean'st thou 'tis a Fraud  Too palpable  ALETES  I knew 'twould startle thee  But 'tis because thou know'st the Fraud my  Pythia  That it alarms thee Didst thou really think  This Youth were Heir to the  Athenian  Crown  Would'st thou not seize the happy Gift of Chance  And to the World proclaim it  PYTHIA  True I should  And bless my Fate that in these sacred Shades  I had nurs'd up unknowingly a King  For my Protector But what then might seem  The Consequence now seems the Cause  Aletes  Will they not say I made the King to gain  The kind Protector  ALETES  So to thee it seems  But who will say it the believing many  Will bow with Rev'rence and implicit Faith  To what thy Shrine ordains and for the few  Who may suspect the Cheat true Policy  Will keep them silent should they dare detect  A Fraud like this and spurn at Right divine  Where were their Power The manyheaded Beast  Would feel the slacken'd Rein and from his Back  Shake off the lordly Rider Nay should  Athens  Be blind to her own Good the States of  Greece  Thou know'st it well would arm in thy Defence  And force her to receive the King thou gav'st her  His Form his unknown Birth his winning Softness  His Education here in Heaven's own Eye  All plead in his behalf And as he tells me  The Queen already with unusual Marks  Of Favour has beheld him For the King  A pious Awe and Rev'rence for the Gods  Is his distinguish'd Attribute Thou seem'st  To weigh my Words To clear thy Doubts at once  Know many Days have past since first I knew  Of their Approach Thou think'st I should have told thee  It needed not I have myself prepar'd  Each previous Circumstance and found due means  To forward the Event Thy Part is easy  Behold the Oracle  PYTHIA  reads  "A banish'd Youth is  Athens'  Cause of Woe"  How know'st thou that  Looking earnestly at him  ALETES  Demand not but read on  PYTHIA  reads  "For that Youth banish'd  Athens  must receive  "Another Youth and on the young Unknown  "Who 'tends my Shrine and whom I call my Son  "Bestow th' Imperial Wreath" The God declare  "No more"  ALETES  Thou seem'st amaz'd  PYTHIA  I am indeed  To find thee thus instructed on a Theme  I came prepar'd to mention The Queen's Passion  Her Lover banish'd  ALETES  What thou seest I know  May tell thee I know more But say from whence  Thou gained'st thy Intelligence  PYTHIA  From one  Whose Zeal may thwart thy Schemes a warm old Man  And firm in  Athens'  Cause who came today  Before the rest and led by my Enquiries  Gave me those Hints on which I thought to build  Prophetic doubtful Answers But I find  My best Instructor here  ALETES  Perhaps thou do'st  Of this rest well assur'd I ne'er had ask'd  Of  Pythia  ought but what I knew with Safety  She might comply with  PYTHIA  Tell me what thou know'st  ALETES  Not yet 'tis better thou remain in Ignorance  Till all be finish'd But pronounce the Oracle  And leave the rest to me Do'st thou distrust me  PYTHIA  I do notYet if on slight Hints alone  Thou form'st this weighty Fraud consider well  What may or may not followBy thy Looks  There should be something hidThy coming hither  Was much upon the Time we found this Child  And since with what almost paternal Care  Thou hast instructed him Tho' that indeed  Might spring from thy Benevolence of Heart  Which I have known is boundless Say  Aletes  What should I think Thou smil'st  ALETES  Wilt thou obey me  PYTHIA  I must and yet if 'tis a Fraud  Aletes  The warm old Man of whom I spake detests  A Stranger King Ev'n  Xuthus'  self whose Worth  He doth acknowledge great he views with Pain  Upon th'  Athenian  Throne  ALETES  I know him well  'Tis  Phorbas  Do not wonder at my Words  But find a Means that I may see the Queen  In secret unobserv'd by prying Eyes  And all that old Man's Fears and Rage shall vanish  He shall with Joy receive a Stranger King  Wilt thou devise the Means  PYTHIA  I now begin  To hope indeed There is some Secret hid  Of most important Weight But does the Queen  ALETES  I will not answer thee my Time's too precious  Only devise some Means that I may see her  Quite unobserv'd by all  PYTHIA  You cannot see her  Till all be past Will that suffice  ALETES  It will  PYTHIA  Here in the Laurel Grove  ALETES  No Place more fit  But O be careful  Pythia  that the King  Observe us not for 'tis of mighty Moment  He should believe this substituted Youth  Of Race  Aeolian  To which End my  Pythia  I have among the Priests these few Days past  When they suspected not th' Approach of  Xuthus  Dropp'd doubtful Hints as if I had discover'd  Some antique Marks amid the Osier Twigs  Which form'd  Ilyssus'  Cradle that denote  He sprang from  Aeolus  And at the Cave  Of great  Trophonius  have I ta'en due Care  Such Answers should be given as would induce  One of less Faith than  Xuthus  to expect  An Heir of his own Family  PYTHIA  The Boy  Knows he of thy Intentions  ALETES  No nor must  Till ripening Time permit His Fate depends  Upon his IgnoranceSoft who comes here  PYTHIA  It is the warm old Man and as I think  Some fair Attendant of the Queen Retire  I would know more butWherefore do'st thou gaze  So ardently upon them  ALETES  Hence away  We must not now be seen  Exeunt  Pythia  and  Aletes  Enter  LYCEA  and  PHORBAS  LYCEA  This Place seems quite retir'd Here if thou wait  I will inform the Queen and her Impatience  Will bring her on the Instant Surely  Phorbas  Something mysterious lurks beneath her Tears  Her strange Anxieties Since thou wer't absent  This unknown Youth alone has fill'd her Thoughts  Of him alone she talks recounts his Words  Describes his Looks his Gestures loves to dwell  On each Particular Ere thou wer't gone  She wish'd and even expected thy Return  Dispatch'd me often tho' she knew 'twas vain  To watch for thy Arrival When the King  Approach'd she smooth'd her Brow as if to hide  The Strugglings of her Mind nay seem'd afraid  He should suspect her Sorrows  PHORBAS  Then to him  She mention'd not this Youth  LYCEA  Her Conduct there  Was most mysterious With a Voice of Fear  She slightly dropp'd that she had seen a Youth  Whom she could wish to bear with her to  Athens  The King consented and with Smiles propos'd  They should adopt him  PHORBAS  Ha adopt him said'st thou  LYCEA  In Sport he spake but at his Words a Glow  Of sudden Joy spread o'er her Face her Tongue  Forgot Restraint and in his Praise grew lavish  Then stopp'd again and hesitating strove  To check its Zeal as fearful to betray  Some hidden Transport  PHORBAS  Whatsoe'er it be  I soon shall damp her Joy This Youth  Lycea  Must not to  Athens  But behold the Queen  LYCEA  O how impatient ere I could return  To tell her thou wer't here she comes herself  Eager to learn thy Tidings  Enter  CREUSA  CREUSA  Now my  Phorbas  Say what thou know'st at once The King already  Consents he should attend us  PHORBAS  Never never  Shall  Athens  see that Youth  CREUSA  What mean'st thou  Phorbas  PHORBAS  Too much already of  Aeolian  Blood  Has hapless  Athens  known  CREUSA  Aeolian  Blood  PHORBAS  The King consents I doubt not his Consent  Yes 'twas my Word great Queen  Aeolian  Blood  This Youth descends from  Aeolus  CREUSA  Be dumb  Or bring me better Tidings  PHORBAS  Worse I cannot  But what I speak is Truth  CREUSA  Peace Monster Peace  Thou know'st not Truth 'Tis thy affected Zeal  For  Athens  for thy Country that suggests  This horrid Falshood 'tis thy Hate of  Xuthus  PHORBAS  What means my Queen or how have I deserv'd  Such harsh Expressions Does my honest Love  For  Athens  and  Creusa  subject me  To such unkind Suspicions  CREUSA  Gracious Gods  It cannot beAlas forgive me  Phorbas  I know not what I say thy Words strike thro' me  They pierce my very Soul O I had hop'd  But tell me all tho' I believe thee honest  Thy Zeal for  Athens  and for me may make thee  Too hasty of Belief Why art thou silent  PHORBAS  Amazement stops my Tongue these Starts of Passion  This Violence of Grief must have a Cause  CREUSA  Perhaps they have perhaps to thee good  Phorbas  This bursting Heart may open all its Sorrows  But tell me first what are thy Proofs from whence  Gain'dst thou this curs'd Intelligence  PHORBAS  O Queen  Thy Looks thy WordsI know not how to answer  Yet if there be Offence in what I speak  My Ignorance offends not I offend  Know then  Creusa  from the Priests who 'tend  This  Delphic  Shrine by your Command I learnt  My first Intelligence  CREUSA  And did they say  This Youth was of  Aeolian  Race  PHORBAS  They did  At least their Words imported little less  They judg'd me  Xuthus'  Friend not Enemy  As would thy Rage suggest and as a Friend  Dropp'd Hints they thought would please me  CREUSA  Then perhaps  It was not Truth they spake they but deceiv'd  Thy Ear with welljudg'd Flattery  PHORBAS  What follow'd  Confirm'd it Truth Has the King mention'd to thee  What Promises were given him at the Shrine  Of sage  Trophonius  CREUSA  General Promises  Of sure Success no more  PHORBAS  Know then great Queen  As I return'd from Converse with the Priests  I met his Friend and Bosom Fav'rite  Lycon  Joy sparkled in his Eyes and his vain Tongue  O'erflow'd with Transport I observ'd it well  And gave the Torrent Passage nay with Art  Ev'n led it blindly forward Till at length  He open'd his whole Soul and under Seal  Of firmest Secrecy told me the King  Would find an Heir at  Delphi  such an Heir  As would rejoice the unapparent Shades  Of his great Ancestors At that I started  He found his Error then and told me glozing  That great  Trophonius  had  almost  proclaim'd  Tho' not expressly  Xuthus  here should find  An Heir of his own Race  CREUSA  Of his own Race  PHORBAS  So said he whether great  Trophonius  spake  This Oracle I know not but I know  Too well whose Oracle to me declar'd it  CREUSA  Think'st thou this Youth  PHORBAS  Grant it were only done  To try my Zeal why should they try it now  Unless some close Design requir'd that Trial  Yes mighty Queen I do believe this Youth  Is our intended King But by yon Heaven  If it be he or any other He  Of  Xuthus'  Race he shall not reign in  Athens  This Poinard first shall drink his Blood  CREUSA  Forbear  That Thought distracts meTho' perhaps 'tis just  O  Phorbas  'twas my Hope my Wish my Prayer  That Youth might reign in  Athens  But thy Words  Strike deadly Damps like baleful Aconite  And poison all within  PHORBAS  What means my Queen  CREUSA  O  Phorbas  O  Lycea  but first swear  By  Nemesis  and the tremendous Powers  Who punish broken Faith no Word no Hint  Shall'scape your Lips of all your Queen declares  BOTH  We swear  CREUSA  Know then O Pain to Memory  I had a Son  PHORBAS  A Son  LYCEA  Good Heaven  PHORBAS  A Son  CREUSA  O my full Heart Thy Mother my  Lycea  Knew all the fatal Process of my Woes  And was their only Solace  Phorbas  yes  I had a Son but witness every God  Whose genial Power presides o'er nuptial Leagues  Nicander  was my wedded Lord That Night  That fatal Night which drove him forth from  Athens  Forc'd from my swelling Womb ere yet mature  Its precious Burthen To thy Mother's Cares  I ow'd my Life In secret she assuag'd  My piercing Pangs and to  Nicander  's Arms  In secret she convey'd the wretched Infant  What follow'd well thou know'st  Nicander  fell  And with him doubtless fell the dear dear Charge  Consign'd to his Protection Yet good  Phorbas  When I beheld this Youth his Looks his Voice  His Age his unknown Birth all all conspir'd  To cheat me into Hopes Alas how fallen  How blasted all  PHORBAS  Great Queen my Tears confess  An old Man's Tears which rarely fall confess  How much I share your Anguish Had I known  Nicander  was your Lord by Earth and Heaven  I would have rais'd all  Athens  in his Cause  Nay been a Rebel to the best of Masters  Ere the dear Pledge of your unspotted Loves  Should thus have fallen untimely Now alas  I have not ev'n one flattering Hope to give thee  Till now I oft have wonder'd why so far  Their Rage pursued  Nicander  'Tis too plain  They knew the precious Burthen which he bore  And for the hapless Child the Father died  CREUSA  O God I feel the Truth of what thou utter'st  And my Heart dies within me O  Lycea  Who who would be a Mother  PHORBAS  Be a Queen  And turn thy Grief to Rage Shall Aliens sport  With thy Misfortunes Shall insulting Spoilers  Smile o'er the Ruins of thy hapless State  While all the golden Harvest is their own  Shall  Xuthus  triumph shall his Race succeed  While thine I mean not to provoke thy Tears  Thy tender Blossoms are torn rudely off  Almost or ere they bloom  CREUSA  It shall not be  No ye immortal Powers Yet let us wait  Till the dire Truth glare on us One short Hour  And Doubt shall be no more Then  Phorbas  then  Should he presume to place on  Athens'  Throne  His alien Race nay tho' this beauteous Youth  This dear Resemblance of my murder'd Lord  Should be the fatal Choice by that dear Shade  Which perish'd as it reach'd the Gates of Life  I will I think I will assist thy Vengeance  Soft who comes here 'Tis he how innocent  How winning soft he looks Whate'er it be  He knows not the Deceit Look on him  Phorbas  Nay thou shalt question him  PHORBAS  Not I Great Queen  Resume yourself nor let this fond Persuasion  Betray you to a Weakness you should blush at  CREUSA  If possible I will

hast rais'd  Such Conflicts here such Hopes such Fears such Doubts  That Apprehension sinks beneath their Weight  Well might'st thou say these solitary Shades  Have now no Peace for me Yet once thou

Likeness  If such there be a semblant Cast of Features  The Sport of Nature in a human Form  Shall Trisles light as these weigh down Conviction  O Queen from first to last th' apparent Scheme  Glares on us now Why were we brought to  Delphi  But that this Youth has long been nurtur'd here  In secret from the World perhaps the Son  Of  Xuthus'  self plac'd here at first to hide  The Guilt and Shame of some dishonest Mother  Tho' now applied to more pernicious Ends  CREUSA  It may be so  PHORBAS  And why say why today  While  Xuthus  stays behind for Oracles  He wanted not is young  Ilyssus  bid  To meet your Eyes and win with artful Tales  Your easy Heart  CREUSA  Bid was he bid to do it  PHORBAS  I saw the Priestess whisper something to him  Then loud she bade him wait for thy Approach  She must forsooth retire to sacred Glooms  And wait for Inspiration  Xuthus'  Gold  Was what inspir'd the Traitress Yet good Heaven  When from the Shrine she gave the fraudful Words  With what strange Art the holy Hypocrite  In mimic Trances died"A banish'd Youth  "Is  Athens'  Cause of Woe" Too truly said  Tho' for a wicked Purpose to allure  Thy easy Faith and lead thee to admit  The Fraud which follow'd  CREUSA  Never never  Phorbas  Will I that Fraud admit How readily  Did  Xuthus  when my foolish Fondness ask'd it  Consent to my Request  To  Lycoa  Thou heard'st him say  We should adopt this Youth in seeming Sport  He spake it but ev'n then th' insulting Tyrant  Couch'd fatal Truths beneath th' ambiguous Phrase  PHORBAS  Why should a Youth design'd for Solitude  Be taught the Arts of War He saw himself  The Impropriety Who is this Sage  That has instructed him And why should  Lycon  O'erflow with sudden Joy but that he found  From thy apparent Fondness for the Boy  Their Schemes grew practicable Nay today  When to the Priestess' self my honest Love  For  Athens  and Dislike of Stranger Kings  Burst freely forth she chid my hasty Zeal  Commended  Xuthus  talk'd of Piety  And Rev'rence to the Gods 'Twas to their Priests  She meant their meddling Priests who dare presume  To sport with Thrones to sell their Gods for Gold  And stamp rank Falshoods with the Seal of Heaven  LYCEA  Forbear you are too loud so near the Temple  Xuthus  himself will hear  CREUSA  We would be heard  Instruct me  Phorbas  by what means to crush  This impious Combination  PHORBAS  Athens  yet  Has honest Hearts Yes  Phorbas  yet has Friends  Who dare be Patriots and prefer their Country  To  Xuthus'  kindest Smile Some such are here  Ev'n now at  Delphi  But illustrious Queen  We must with Caution act The Name of Heaven  Howe'er usurp'd adds Vigour to their Cause  And weakens ours We might in secret find  A sure Revenge  CREUSA  What  PHORBAS  Death  CREUSA  Of  Xuthus  PHORBAS  His  Might follow but the more immediate Cause  Should earliest be remov'd the Boy  CREUSA  The Boy  Why should he die Believe me honest  Phorbas  He knows not of the Fraud His every Look  Proclaims his Innocence If impious Men  Make him their Instrument of evil Deeds  Can he be blam'd Bred up in Shades poor Youth  He never knew the Arts of base Mankind  Nor should he share their Punishment  PHORBAS  O Queen  They have too well succeeded This fond Passion  Which their insidious Cunning first inspir'd  Clings close about your Heart and may at last  Undo us allBut hark that Noise declares  The finish'd Rites Retire we to the Grove  And there will I enforce  CREUSA  No let us stay  I will confront this artful Politician  And shew him I am yet a Queen  PHORBAS  Perhaps  'Twere better to retire till our full Scheme  Were ripe for Vengeance  *  Aside  Yet if we remain  High Words must rise which will alarm her Pride  And fit her for my Purpose  Enter  XUTHUS ILYSSUS  Priests Virgins Guards  c  from the Temple  XUTHUS  coming up to  Creusa  Thy Looks  Creusa  thy abrupt Departure  Affronting to the God himself and these  His sacred Ministers too plainly shew  Irreverent Rage resisting Heaven's high Will  Nor do'st thou want I see unthinking Woman  Inflamers of thy FollyBut of this  Enough behold the Youth whom Heaven designs  Thy Heir and mine  CREUSA  My Heir  XUTHUS  Thy Heir  Creusa  What means that haughty Look Why with Contempt  Do'st thou behold him Is he chang'd  Creusa  Have a few Hours so totally transform'd him  Is all that winning Grace of which thou spak'st  Almost with Rapture is that native Charm  Of Innocence all vanish'd Hear him speak  Hear if he talks less sensibly than when  Thy pleas'd Attention hung upon his Words  And lent each Syllable an added Grace  What hast thou found or thy grave Monitor  What has he found which can so suddenly  Have wrought this wond'rous Change Is it because  The Gods have thought with thee that he deserves  A Crown or is it that my Will consents  And therefore thine proud Queen perversely strives  To combat thy Affections  CREUSA  We methinks  Have chang'd Affections The calm steady  Xuthus  Whose equal Mind ne'er knew the stormy Gusts  Of discomposing Passion now can feel  Indecent Warmth when touch'd by pious Zeal  Nay he to whom the tend'rer Sentiments  Seem'd but the Weakness of the human Frame  Now wakes inspir'd with some unusual Softness  Have Oracles the Power to raise at once  The kind Affections or did he conceal  The smother'd Flame 'till authoris'd by Heaven  It might burst out unquestion'd  XUTHUS  Haughty Queen  I understand thee well thou think'st this Youth  A Substitute of mine and dar'st affront  Yon awful Shrine the Fountain of pure Truth  But by that God who bears the vengeful Bow  And whose large EyeYet wherefore should I strive  By Oaths to undeceive thee Breasts like mine  Can scorn th' imputed Falshood they detest  Nor am I now to learn from what vile Source  Thy vain Suspicions rise But know proud Queen  This Youth shall reign in  Athens  and yet more  To punish thy vain Pride since thou provok'st it  I do believe him of  Aeolian  Race  CREUSA  Thou do'st  XUTHUS  I do A Race as glorious Queen  As  Cecrops'  boasted lineage For the Youth  Were I to beg the choicest Boon of Heaven  From my own Loins to rise I could not hope  A nobler Offspring  PHORBAS  Aside to  Creusa  Hear'st thou that  CREUSA  I do  And will revenge the Insult  ILYSSUS  Kneeling  Gracious Queen  What have I done which should estrange thee to me  Am I the unhappy Cause of these Dissentions  CREUSA  Kneel not to me  Ilyssus  XUTHUS  Kneel not to her  'Tis I am thy Protector and thy Friend  Nay now thy Father  ILYSSUS  Yet O mighty King  Permit me at her Royal Feet to pay  My humblest Duty If I call thee Father  She sure must be a Mother  She turns away disorder'd  XUTHUS  Rise  Ilyssus  Thou seest she stands unmov'd  ILYSSUS  No now she softens  I see it in her Eyes  CREUSA  I will I will  Be Mistress of my SoulWhy kneel'st thou Youth  I blame not thee  XUTHUS  Men then thou blam'st  Creusa  I am the Object of thy Rage 'Tis  Xuthus  Thou think'st unworthy of th'  Athenian  Throne  CREUSA  Athens  might well have spar'd a foreign Lustre  Secure of Fame had  Xuthus  ne'er been born  XUTHUS  Ungrateful Queen had  Xuthus  ne'er been born  What now had  Athens  been  CREUSA  Perhaps in Ruins  And better so than to become the Prey  Of needy wand'ring Strangers  XUTHUS  Earth and Heaven  This the ReturnI knew thou never loved'st me  Yet witness Heav'n I ravish'd not thy Hand  Thou gav'dst it sullenly but yet thou gav'dst it  And I well hop'd thy Female Sense of Honour  Of Duty to thy Lord might have secur'd  At least my future Peace Thy tend'rer Thoughts  The Wife's best Ornament I knew were buried  In a Plebeian Grave  CREUSA  Plebeian Grave  XUTHUS  Fool that I was I flatter'd thy vain Sorrows  Indulg'd their weak Excess and rais'd I find  Imaginary Rivals in the Tomb  But never more  Creusa  never more  Shalt thou affront my illrequited Fondness  I will destroy that Pageant of thy Passion  Tear from that Idol Shrine th'insulting Wreaths  And cancel thy mock Worship  ILYSSUS  Gracious Queen  Retire a while  CREUSA  Be goneInsulting Tyrant  Touch but a Wreath that's sacred to  Nicander  And by pale  Hecate  's awful Rites I swear  Thy Life shall pay the Forfeit nay the Lives  Of thy whole dastard RacePlebeian Grave  Had that Plebeian liv'd Imperial  Xuthus  Had crouch'd beneath his Feet  XUTHUS  O would to Heaven  This scepter'd Arm could raise him from the Earth  That thou might'st see how infamous a Slave  Thou dar'st prefer to  Xuthus  Come  Ilyssus  We leave her to her Follies Look not on her  She

Schemes  Abortive all his politic Designs  Then let him die despis'd  CREUSA  Agreed but how  PHORBAS  Now at the Banquet may we crush at once  His full blown hopes The fatal Cause remov'd  Th' Effect of course must cease  CREUSA  What Cause  PHORBAS  The Boy  I see thou shudder'st at it but great Queen  Hear but the cogent Reasons I shall offer  And thou wilt think as I do For the Boy  Heav'n knows I wish to spare him but no Means  No earthly Means but this can curse compleatly  This politic Designer Doubtless long  This fav'rite Scheme to place on  Athens'  Throne  His hated Race has labour'd in his Breast  And all his Hours employ'd On this alone  He builds the firm Foundation of his Peace  His Happiness to come His Death were nothing  He knows his Friends the Minions of his Fortune  He knows all  Greece  such is their Dread and Awe  Of  Delphi  's Shrine will join in the Support  Of this deceitful Claim and that firm Hope  Will make him triumph ev'n in Death and laugh  At our too shallow Vengeance  CREUSA  Laugh he shall not  No I will punish home  PHORBAS  You cannot punish  By any Means but this And know great Queen  I have a Poison of such subtile Force  Why do'st thou start of such amazing Strength  Yet so peculiar in its Operation  That it shall seem the Surfeit of the Feast  Not we have done the Deed At least shall seem so  To all but  Xuthus'  self for he methinks  Should know the Truth at least suspect it strongly  And yet not dare Revenge  CREUSA  I cannot bear it  Howe'er we fail in our Revenge my  Phorbas  The Boy must live  PHORBAS  Good Heav'n is this  Creusa  Is this the vengeful Queen who would not hear  Remorse or Pity's VoiceFarewel then  Athens  Yes my poor Country thou must sink enslav'd  To foreign Tyrants She who should defend  Thy Rights thy Liberties stands tamely by  And sees the Yoke impos'd nay smiles to see it  Thy Queen the last of her illustrious Line  Consents to thy Destruction  CREUSA  Never  Phorbas  Do what thou wilt With this last parting Pang  I give him to thy RageYet oh beware  I see him not again One Look from him  Would baffle all thy Schemes  PHORBAS  Now at the Banquet  Will we infuse the Draught ev'n in the Cup  Which the King's self presents to his young Heir  In Token of Election  CREUSA  Stay good  Phorbas  PHORBAS  Already have I for the just Design  Suborn'd a faithful Slave Nay should it fail  I have a trusty Band a chosen few  Athenian  Souls who scorn to bow the Knee  To any foreign Lord these will I place  At the Pavilion Doors if need require  To second our Attempt  CREUSA  Yet stay good  Pherbas  How kindly did he seem to sympathize  With my Distress nay almost chid the King  When his loud Rage  PHORBAS  He had been taught his Lesson  'Twas all Design all Artifice to work  Upon a Woman's Weakness  CREUSA  Think'st thou so  PHORBAS  I do But O my Queen be more than Woman  Conquer this Foible of thy Sex  CREUSA  Heav'n knows  How much it costs to do itGo

least not unsuspected Did she say'st thou  Reject thy Message  PYTHIA  Scarcely did she pay  The decent Dues my sacred Office claims  And when I prest her more with sullen Pride  She silently withdrew  ALETES  See her I must  Where went she  PYTHIA  To the Shades which overhang  Th' Aonian Fount  ALETES  I will pursue her thither  PYTHIA  It may not be for now I know thy Secret  'Tis my turn to be

That she would wait him in the Laurel Grove  Here then thou may'st surprise them both and crown  At once thy whole Design  ALETES  Thou counsell'st well  And I will guide me by thy kind Advice  O  Pythia  how did every thing conspire  To give me hopes that I should place the Boy  Secure on  Athens'  Throne unknown to all  But those whom Fate had made his firmest Friends  The very Means I us'd to make it sure  Have been most adverse to the Cause I labour'd  Had I relied on  Xuthus'  Piety  Nor mention'd  Aeolus  Success were mine  And let me hope it still What most I fear  Is the Queen's Warmth of Passion To which end  I must proceed with Tenderness and hide  For some short time  Ilyssus  from her Knowledge  I have unnumber'd Cautions to premise  Which her o'erflowing Joy may haply ruin  The Banquet is it ready  PYTHIA  It has long  In vain expected its illustrious Guests  The King already has forgot his Rage  And hopes returning Thought may move the Queen  To equal Amity He therefore finds  Continual Causes to delay the Feast  ALETES  Retire Perhaps 'tis she I hear the Steps  Of some who move this way  Exit  Pythia  What means he here  Why art thou absent from the Banquet Youth  Enter  ILYSSUS  ILYSSUS  It has no Joys for me I fear  Aletes  Thou and the  Pythia  have most foully play'd  For my Advancement  ALETES  Ha  ILYSSUS  Where are the Parents  Whom thou

Tenderness I know not how alarm'd  My throbbing Heart with Hopes and Doubts and Fears  Unfelt before ev'n she has taught her Eyes  To look with Strangeness on me The good King  Who yet withdraws not his Protection from me  Seems lost in anxious ThoughtUnkind  Aletes  Art thou the Cause of this Say am I sprung  Of Race  Aeolian  For by Heaven I swear  By that pure Fountain of immortal Truth  I

Would shew thee what thou wert but thy Impatience  Brooks not that short Delay It seems  Aletes  Has lost his usual Credit with  Ilyssus  Ev'n with the Youth his anxious Care has form'd  Think'st thou the Man who taught thy feeling Heart  To start at Falshood would himself commit  The Fraud thou shudder'st at What have I done  Which should induce thee to a Thought so base  Did e'er my Precepts contradict my Heart  Did I e'er teach a Virtue I not practis'd  I see thou art confounded Know then Youth  I blame not thy Impatience nay I praise  That Modesty which can so soon resume  Its Seat when all things round are big with Wonder  Ere Night thou shalt know all till then  Ilyssus  Behave as  Athens'  King  ILYSSUS  O good  Aletes  Forgive my Rashness Yes I know thee honest  As Truth itself and know the wond'rous Debt  I owe thy Goodness Yet if thou confess  That I have Reason for these anxious Cares  Thou wilt permit me still to question thee  Nay look upon me whilst I speak to thee  Perhaps thou hast some secret Cause  Aletes  For all that kind Attention thou hast shewn me  From Infancy till now Why do'st thou turn  Thy Eyes to Earth 'Tis plain thou hast a Cause  Thou know'st from whom I spring how can'st thou else  With Confidence assert that yet ere Night  I shall know allSay this at least  Aletes  Shall the Queen's Anger cease  ALETES  It shall  Ilyssus  Ev'n now I wait her here on what Design  I must not yet inform thee The next Time  Thou shalt behold her thou wilt find a Change  Incredible indeed from Rage to Fondness  From cold Reserve to Tears of bursting Joy  Ilyssus  is going to speak eagerly  Ask me no moreYet something didst thou say  Relating to the Cause which fix'd me here  Thy Guardian thy Instructor andthe Time  Will come when thou shalt know it all  Ilyssus  And bless my Memory  ILYSSUS  Thou weep'st  Aletes  My Tears will mingle too  ALETES  Forbear and leave me  Yet stay a while for now perhaps we part  To meet no more  ILYSSUS  No more Thou wilt not leave me  When most I want thy Care 'Twas my first Thought  'Twas the first Boon I ask'd of the good King  That thou might'st be my kind Instructor still  He prais'd my Gratitude and I had promis'd  To bring him to thy Cottage He himself  Shall be a Suitor to thee  ALETES  Thou hast ask'd  Thou know'st not what It cannot be  Ilyssus  That  Xuthus  and  Aletes  e'er should meet  On terms of Amity The Smiles of Greatness  To me have lost their Value For thy Love  I could do much and to be sever'd from thee  Pulls at my Heartstrings But resistless Fate  Has fix'd its Seal and we must part for ever  How hard soe'er it seem Thy Youth will soon  Amidst the busy Scenes of active Greatness  Forget its Monitor But I must bear  In hopeless Solitude the Pangs of Absence  Till Thought shall be no more  ILYSSUS  O heav'nly Powers  Then there is something dreadful yet conceal'd  I cannot part from thee in Ignorance  Tell me  Aletes  ALETES  Would I could But now  It must not beHaste to the Banquet Youth  Thy Duty calls thee thither  ILYSSUS  Go I cannot  Till thou assur'st me we shall meet again  ALETES  If possible we will If not remember  When thou shalt know thyself that on thyself  Thy Fate depends that Virtue Glory Happiness  Are close connected and their sad Reverse  Is Vice is Pain is InfamyAlas  These were the Lessons of thy private Life  This I have told thee oft but my fond Tongue  Runs o'er its former Precepts and forgets  Thou now must mount a Throne a larger Scene  Of Duty opens  ILYSSUS  Yet the tender Friend  Who should direct me leaves me to myself  Can'st thou abandon me  ALETES  Would Fate permit  I would attend thee still But oh  Ilyssus  Whate'er becomes of me when thou shall reach  That envied Pinacle of earthly Greatness  Where faithful Monitors but rarely follow  Ev'n there amidst the kindest Smiles of Fortune  Forget not thou wert once distress'd and friendless  Be strictly just but yet like Heaven with Mercy  Temper thy Justice From thy purged Ear  Banish base Flattery and spurn the Wretch  Who would persuade thee thou art more than Man  Weak erring selfish Man endued with Power  To be the Minister of public Good  If Conquest charm thee and the Pride of War  Blaze on thy Sight remember thou art placed  The Guardian of Mankind nor build thy Fame  On Rapines and on Murders Should soft Peace  Invite to Luxury the pleasing Bane  Of happy Kingdoms know from thy Example  The Bliss or Woe of nameless Millions springs  Their Virtue or their Vice Nor think by Laws  To curb licentious Man those Laws alone  Can bend the headstrong Many to their Yoke  Which make it present Int'rest to obey them  O Boy  Enter  PYTHIA  hastily  PYTHIA  Ilyssus  wherefore art thou here  The King expects thee and the Banquet waits  ILYSSUS  I cannot go  ALETES  Thou must thy Fate depends  Upon thy Absence now The Queen approaches  After the Banquet I again will see thee  And thou shalt know the whole I will by Heaven  Exit

hoarded Miseries  ALETES  Thy better Genius  CREUSA  That Voice is sure familiar to my Ear  Who art thou speak  ALETES  One whom Adversity  Has taught to know himself I bring thee tidings  Of an unhappy Man who wrong'd thee much  But much repented of the Wrongs he did thee  Of thy  Nicander  Queen  CREUSA  Nicander  say'st thou  O then thou art indeed my better Genius  ALETES  Now arm thy Soul for Wonders yet to come  Perhaps he lives  CREUSA  He lives  Looking on him with Amazement  ALETES  After great Irresolution and Struggles with himself  Behold him here  She faints  What has my Rashness doneThe Blush of Life  Has left her Cheek the Pulse forgets to move  Where shall I turn I cannot call for Aid  Nor can I leave her thusShe breathes she stirs  Yes yes  Creusa  thy  Nicander

 Phorbas  I found thee not but met at my Return  Creusa  's self Despair was in her Eyes  With hasty Steps she shot impatie  by me  Nor listen'd when I spake I follow'd wond'ring  And enter'd the Pavilion  PHORBAS  The Pavilion  Why went she to the Banquet  LYCEA  Eager went  Despair and Anguish mixing on her Look  But O good Heaven how chang'd was that Despair  To inexpressive Joy when from the Croud  She learnt  Ilyssus  had delay'd the Feast  And won the King once more to ask her Presence  "Where is he let me clasp him to my Breast"  She cried "I now no longer will resist  "Heaven's high command" Imperial  Xuthus  rose  With Transport to receive her and loud Shouts  Proclaim'd the People's Joy When Death to Sight  Eternal Pain to Memory the Slave  Presents the Goblets Fill she cried a third  I too will hail  Ilyssus  King of  Athens  But first all swear swear by immortal  Jove  By the fardarting God who here presides  And the chaste Guardian of our native Fanes  Swear here swear all and binding be the Oath  Ilyssus  only shall be  Athens'  King  PHORBAS  What could she mean  LYCEA  Attentive  Xuthus  caught  With Joy the happy Omen and all swore  Ilyssus  only should be  Athens'  King  This done I saw her from  Ilyssus'  Hand  Snatch the dire Goblet and to him resign  Her own untouch'd The Slave who mix'd the Draught  Turn'd oale and trembled I with eager Zeal  Press'd forward but in vain she firmly grasp'd  The Bowl and smiling drank it to the Dregs  PHORBAS  The Poison haI knew her foolish Fondness  Would start at Murder's Name But wherefore die  Why turn

the  Pythia  say'st thou  Then there is Mischief toward  LYCEA  Yet now alone  We may surprize her for I saw the Maid  Quick from the Fane return with hasty Steps  As if dispatch'd on some important
