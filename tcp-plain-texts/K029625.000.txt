 ABELARD TO ELOISA  Price  s d  ABELARD  TO  ELOISA  A POEM  BY MR JERNINGHAM  LONDON  PRINTED FOR J ROBSON NEW BONDSTREET  M DCC XCII  TO THE EARL OF CARLISLE  IN addressing this Poem to Your Lordship I am endeavouring to obtain for it the sanction of a very skillful Judge of a Person who has himself adorned the poetical walk and who has exalted the muse of Tragedy  in that excellent composition  The Father's Revenge  I have the honour to be with the impression of the greatest regard  Your LORDSHIP's Obedient humble Servant EDW JERNINGHAM  ADVERTISEMENT  THE monastery of CLUNI from whence ABELARD is supposed to write the following Epistle was founded in the year near the village of Mascon on the river Graone The Head of this convent in the time of ABELARD was distinguished for his learning and humanity History elevates him above the vulgar herd of monks by the appellation of the Venerable PETER He extended his generous protection to the unfortunate ABELARD when he was under the censure of the court of Rome  SAINT BERNARD also is connected with the story of Paraclete This great man stands eminently forward in the picture of the twelfth century Born with a mind too restless and enterprising to be confined within the circle of monastic occupations he rushed into the tumult  of active life and took the lead in some of the most important transactions of that period With an undisciplined ardour peculiar to his character he precipitated his country into that ruinous measure the second crusade Behold him at another time hastening to the contest that held all EUROPE in suspence which exhibited two contending candidates for the popedom The authority and vehemence of BERNARD overpowered the pretensions of ANACLETUS and INNOCENT was seated on the papal throne The enemies of this celebrated Abbot never impeached his moral character but it must be allowed that in his zeal against the innovation of new opinions he has sometimes left unregarded the superior duty of charity A letter of his to the Cardinal GUIDO the pope's legate in France contains the most intolerant and sanguinary counsel His persecution however of ABELARD was prompted according to the opinion of some authors by an impulse of jealousy alarmed at the splendid literary reputation of so young a person  ABELARD in the following epistle lays a considerable stress upon his sentence of excommunication In the dark ages that spiritual humiliation was felt as the greatest calamity the relation the parent the lover the friend suspended their endearing offices and withdrew from the degraded offender  ABELARD  TO  ELOISA  YON midnight bell that frights the peaceful air  Commands the Fathers to their wonted pray'r  Now in long order flows the sable throng  Like a dark sullen stream that creeps along  Why joins not ABELARD the sainted train  Does torpid sloth his ling'ring steps detain  These walls that pillow steep'd in tears attest  That sleep is exil'd from this tortur'd breast  This lamp proclaims the same whose trembling beam  Guides while my hand pursues the glowing theme  While the dread secret from my soul I tear  And unreserv'd my bosom'd feelings bear  Ah me the passion that my soul misled  Was check'd not conquer'd buried but not dead  Now bursting from the grave in evil hour  It hastens to its prey with fiercer pow'r  And vulturelike with appetite increas'd  It riots on the undiminish'd feast  Daughter of Paraclete dost thou complain  In iron silence that I lock'd my pain  That not to thee soft solacer in woe  I bad the troubled waves of Anguish flow  Methought the course of three long years' retreat  Would scarce thy length'ning sacrifice complete  Methought I should profane the hallow'd rite  Did my laments thy pitying ear affright  Thus at the altar wrapt in holy dread  The youth of Macedon in silence bled  Nor from his tortur'd and consuming hand  Dismiss'd the living closeadhering brand  Alluding to the boy at Athens who while he was assisting at a religious ceremony endured a burning coal that sell on his hand rather than disturb the sacrifice  But now thy slow inauguration's o'er  And thou hast reach'd Religion's tranquil shore  Now that stern habit throws without controul  Her chain of adamant around thy soul  May not th'unhappy ABELARD disclose  To her who pities most his train of woes  Ye sullen gates within whose bound confin'd  The wretch who enters flings his joys behind  Emerging from the dome ye crowding spires  Which sunrobed glitter like ascending fires  That funeral spot with many a cypress spread  Where shriek the spirits of the guilty dead  Yon moping forest whose extensive sway  Admits no lucid interval of day  No cheering vista with a trail of light  Flies thro' the heavy gloom of lasting night  Ye hermitages deep immers'd in wood  Wash'd by the passing tributary flood  Whose easy waves softmurm'ring as they roll  Lull the strong goadings of the feeling soul  Ye tow'ring rocks to wonder's eye address'd  Mishapen piles by Terror's hand impress'd  Ah not these scenes magnificently rude  To Virtue's lore have ABELARD subdued  When late my steps drew near the peopled choir  What erring wishes did my heart inspire  To the deep mysteries as I advanced  Still in thy presence was my soul entranced  While bending to the earth the choral throng  Pause 'ere they usher the emphatic song  While kneeling seraphs trembling as they glow  Veil with their radiant wings their bashful brow  While the deep organ as by fear controul'd  Its solemn sound like distant thunder roll'd  While thick'ning odours dim'd the dread abode  And th' altar shudder'd at th' approaching God  'Midst these august terrific rites unmov'd  My guilty thoughts to other altars rov'd  In Love enchas'd a dearer image blest  That living chapel my impassion'd breast  Where burns a hungry and insatiate flame  To that soft deity I blush to name  Those hours to recollection spring renew'd  When Passion urg'd us and when Pleasure woo'd  When captur'd by Desire's voluptuous hold  Involv'dcombin'dembodiedand insoul'd  ForbearLet dim Oblivion cast behind  Words that would soil thy purity of mind  Recall recall that interesting hour  When in the flush of Youth and Beauty's flow'r  Ah doom'd severely doom'd to meet no more  When from each dearer self our forms we tore  How to Affection's finer touch consign'd  My face upon thy summer cheek inclin'd  Felt as it dropt thy tear's celestial dew  While sighs not words breath'd forth our last adieu  Intruding Fancy rais'd the veil between  And shew'd Futurity's unwelcome scene  Nights of long absence that expect no dawn  Divorcing gulphs that must for ever yawn  In thy pure soul a purer self I trac'd  Our glowing minds with energy embrac'd  Whence th' intellectual progeny arose  Which kindred fears and kindred hopes compose  Endearments tending to one mutual aim  The same our sorrow and our joy the same  Now that thy spirit is divinely wrought  To nobler objects flies thy soaring thought  For free and unrestrain'd of human ties  Thy soul uncaptiv'd springs into the skies  To Contemplation's height sublime you sail  While wings seraphic aid the hallow'd gale  From man to God Perfection's dazzling source  Unwearied you pursue your bright ning course  And as thro' station'd angels you advance  Send on the throne of Heav'n a daring glance  For me unequal to this dizzy height  Undisciplin'd unwing'd for mystic flight  To speed the ling'ring step of cloyster hours  To science I consign'd my mental pow'rs  Fame met me in her path and round my brow  Engarlanded the wreath of Splendor's glow  Then swell'd disturb'd with Envy's with'ring pow'r  The serpent Bernard hiss'd within my bow'r  Pour'd the black venom with insidious aim  Chill'd my soul's health and dimm'd my radiant name  Still still inventing some malignant plan  Impetuous turbulent vindictive man  Behind the simple meek monastic vest  Ambition blazes in his troubled breast  Averse amid the pensive shades to dwell  He shuns the stillness of the lonely cell  Embroils the contests that involve  the great  Deepens the storm that darkens o'er the state  And like the bird of Jove by vengeance driv'n  Bears in his grasp th' artillery of Heav'n  See Anacl√©tus trembling at his frown  To Innocent resign the doubtful crown  Mark at the impulse of his bold command  The throng that hastens to the palmy land  See to his gaudy levee crouds resort  See the gay tinsel'd  oplings of the court  There too the hoary sages of the law  And military chiefs approach with awe  There abbots princes cardinals advance  And all the splendor all the pride of France  As not unworthy of his sainted rage  Now meaner objects tread his busy stage  He bids thy ABELARD ascend the scene  And pours the torrent of his holy spleen  Then Persecution with resistless sway  Thro' her longsounding floodgates burst away  Her armory the Vatican display'd  In all its proud magnificence array'd  From whence abrupt th' avenging Pontiff sprung  And at my peace the bolt of terror flung  While o'er her victim to dishonour led  Her cloud of iron extirpation spread  Now the pale outcast both of Heav'n and earth  I curs'd the day that glimmer'd on my birth  Degradedshunn'dto infamy allied  Amidst the ruins of my soul I cried  No more my image to her thought adjoin'd  Shall share the heav'n of ELOISA'S mind  No more I cried my reprobated name  Shall from her lips its daily honour claim  No longer to the throne of GOD repair  Borne on the wings of her triumphant pray'r  Now frenzy urg'd my wild'ring steps to rove  Beneath the night of yon extensive grove  Now urg'd along the moutain's top to range  Despair still haunting me thro' ev'ry change  To tread th' advent'rous path that coasts the brow  Which scowls tremendous o'er the vale below  Then to the summit of yon rock I toil'd  That shoots its crags fantastically wild  There rush'd upon my view the hallow'd cross  Cloath'd in the garb of venerable moss  This wonted pledge of mercy and delight  Struck on my fading hope a dark'ning blight  No more the saving allatoning rood  The grisly symbol of revenge it stood  Lost in the extacy of strong despair  With madd'ning hand I tore my rooted hair  'Twas then the seer of warm compassion came  To lull my tortures and dispel my shame  "Desist" the Priest of Charity began  "And own once more the dignity of man  "No longer Rome and ABELARD are foes  "The thunders of the Vatican repose  "The holy church by my remonstrance won  "Takes to her bosom her still darling son"  Hail to the tidings of that chearing voice  That bids the humbled ABELARD rejoice  That bids his image to her thought rejoin'd  Still share the heav'n of ELOISA'S mind  Yet not thy person that attractive sight  Diffusing round ineffable delight  Nor thy discourse illum'd with Wisdom's ray  Which with soft rapine steals the sould away  That eye where meek Dominion holds her throne  That voice where Music smooths her softest tone  By liberal Nature prodigally giv'n  What words can't paint that smile of opening Heav'n  These various charms that pass all human praise  These charms that once adorn'd my happier days  No more shall I beholdtis folly to complain  Those days of splendor ne'er must rise again  Adieu thou mistress of enchanting pow'r  Thou blissful vision of a transient hour  For such appears to Fancy still how dear  The sloping race of Rapture's swift career  When Heav'n enforcing its benign decree  With lavish bounty gave thy form to me  Hope now is dead and Pleasure's knell is rung  With sable thoughts my dreary mind is hung  'Twas at the hour when from the sorrowing view  The glowing God of day his beams withdrew  When Vesper all her pageantry display'd  Fretting the sky with many an awful shade  Here trees appear'd that struggled with the storm  There a wan cloud assum'd a spectre's form  A solitary hand here grasp'd a spear  There angry meteors combated in air  Now riding on the wind with threat'ning mien  The dark terrific phantom Death was seen  From a thick vapour's dread unfolding womb  Now bodied forth the likeness of a tomb  Thy form oh ELOISE I clearly traced  Thine airy arms the sepulchre embraced  That mimic tomb my early fate foreshews  While my soul labours with prophetic throes  Now closes fast my short disastrous day  To life's dark boundary I haste away  The virtuous CLUNI still relieves my pains  To thee will he convey my cold remains  This kind assurance mitigates my doom  Thou'lt stand the guardian angel at my tomb  Clos'd be this form in ELOISA'S fane  She'll sight my requiem with a Lover's strain  Oft to my grave with sorrowful delight  Will she repair as glooms the thick'ningnight  Burst from thy cloud oh Cynthia burst away  The holy shadow of her frame display  Let the soft texture of her length'ning shade  Repose along the spot where mine is laid  Were thus her presence to my wishes giv'n  Death would rejoice my grave would then be Heav'n  Forgive this last effusion of a heart  Which Love and Nature form'd unstain'd by Art  Which midst the fears that wait on Death's decree  With all its wonted ardor darts to thee  Prepare prepare for that relentless day  When the dark hearse this form shall bear away  When to the fane of Paraclete convey'd  My humble bier shall at thy feet be laid  Prepare preparethrow back the vestal gate  Receive the victim of untimely fate  Receive the Youth misfortune held to view  till mid his woes invariably true  That Youth from other strong affections free  Whose life was one continued hymn to thee  That Youth whom passion rushing on his breast  With tort'ring and extatic hand impress'd  repare prepareyet check the bursting moan  hou to compassion exquisitely prone  Lest glowing sympathy with Death at strife  Should kindle my cold ashes into life  And my rous'd voice invading Nature's laws  Breathe in loud accents terrible applause  Yet will my soul pour forth another claim  Ah me what sudden langour chills my frame  My tremulous and feeble hand denies  Its functiongath'ring vapours cloud my eyes  Of all that passion dictated of mine  If now I touch the sad the closing line  If 'ere these words thy pity shall implore  This warm and raving heart shall throb no more  FarewellBe thou with added years still blest  Ah let me live in thy recording breast  FINIS
