 THE PROGRESS  of  WIT A CAVEAT FOR THE Use of an Eminent Writer  By a FELLOW of  AllSouls  To which is prefix'd An Explanatory Discourse to the READER  By GAMALIEL GUNSON Professor of Physick and Astrology  This Verse be thine my Friend nor Thou refuse  This from no venal or ungrateful Muse  Read these instructive Leaves  Pope  to Mr  Jervas  LONDON  Printed for J WILFORD at the  Crown  in  StationersCourt  MDCCXXX  TO THE READER  Courteous READER  _I Am by Profession no Poet Yet having a Son of my own at this Time of no small Hope in one of our famous Universities I cannot therefore be suppos'd to want Reverence for those Seminaries of the Muses Upon this Account partly for of Itself I have no great Opinion of Poetry but perceiving at the Head of the Manuscript that it had been written by a  Fellow of AllSouls  and chiefly invited by some encouraging Expressions in the Beginning alluding to a Chariot that could carry a Man up to the Stars I bestow'd a serious Perusal on the Verses which I herewith publish and which I found one rainy Day at the Bottom of a  HackneyCoach where I suppose they might have been dropt by Somebody who had been in Possession of that Coach before me  But I confess the oftner I perus'd the Manuscript the less I was able to comprehend of its Meaning I had not indeed labour'd far in the Matter before I discovered that the Author notwithstanding he has been pleased to make free with the  Stars  is a  Novice  in  our Science  so that what he writes concerning the  Thinness of Heaven's Purlieussurmounting the Stars in a Chariot of Air  and such like promising Conceptions ought not I believe to be taken in the strict Sense of the Phrase but only for a Joke or a FancyHowever some of my Profession to whom I shew'd it agreed that it was a dark Piece of Work had more in it than  Satire  and for any thing They or I knew to the contrary might be Matter of Danger to the Government and ought to be carried to the Secretary's Office  By a Mind laudably filled with a Zeal for his Country's Safety every Hint that infers its Danger should be thought of the utmost Importance To the Secretary's Office therefore I went with it and put it into the Hands of one who appear'd to think Himself more considerable than any Body I cou'd see about him I begg'd the Favour that he would look it over and give me his Opinion whether it was a treasonable Libel I would not willingly do  Injustice to the Characters of Persons above my Station tho' it is well known  Physick  and  Astrology  are consider'd with  Respect  among Liberal Sciences But truly be seem'd to me to peruse it with less Seriousness than I suppose with all due Reverence to his Office became the Trust that was lodg'd in him For he laugh'd out once or twice and lifting his Eyes from the Paper took upon him to remark me with a Countenance which I thought too merry for the Occasion He was pleas'd when he came to the following Lines to read them aloud to a Young Spark in Red and ask'd him what  He  thought of the MatterI confess I was almost in a Passion when this  FeatherBrain  made answer that it was the liveliest Satire in the World upon a  BawdyHouse  of his Acquaintance by the Bank Side over the WaterI cite the very Verses for the Reader's more effectual Amazement at the Unaccountableness of the Young Fellows of this forward Generation  Caught by the gulphy  Void  that gloom'd below  Crowds from the Current's fairdescending Flow  Indrawn at once by Darkness swallow'd o'er  Sunk from their sunny Scene and rose no more  Still gap'd th'unclosing Deep o'er Millions gone  Yet still insatiate hourly swallow'd on  I could not forbear telling this Story with due Gravity and Resentment to a certain  Lawyer of my Acquaintance whom I met just landed at  WhiteHall  Stairs we walk'd together a few Turns in the PrivyGarden and he open'd the Manuscript where it speaks of  Shapeless Bodies  Whose breathing Bulks to Life and Motion blown  Shot into human Forms compleatly grown  Mix'd Rank and Sex sprung thro' the liquid Jett  But pouring outward clear  Distinction  met  He read it once and again and was clear in his Opinion it meant the  Masquerade  in the  Haymarket  He own'd indeed that under proper Hands it might be explain'd into something more considerableBut we wave it cry'd he after reading it a little farther we will wave the Point of  Treason  in Exchange for  Scandalum Magnatum  It follows here as clear as Sunshine upon a Minister of State and a PrivyCounsellor Then he read to me this slanderous  Inuendo  of People who coming within Reach of a  dark bustling Power obscurely seen  From the blind Bounty of his hasty Hand  Buoyant in Boats rode o'er the shining Sand  Of different Form these BoatsA single Oar  Distinguish'd somesome wing'd their Sides with more  Others with Oars and Sails conjoyn'd made way  And mow'd the murm'ring Surge with sweepy Sway  While some slow Polemen o'er their Toil reclin'd  Push'd their check'd Barks and labouring lagg'd behind  Some waded naked c  He ask'd me whether I did not plainly discern what great Man in a certain Assembly was pointed at under this Image of a  dark bustling Power obscurely seen  upon which recollecting myself as became me and pondering the Words to the best of my Capacity I reply'd I thought it was the  Devil  He shook his Head and inform'd me civilly that I was  a little  mistaken but perceiving me in some measure abash'd he assur'd me it was so natural an Error that any Body might have fallen into it as well as I Then proceeded to convince me that  shining Sand  was a  CantWord  for  Money Bags  that by the Boats said to be distributed at Random by the Bounty of the blind Power that was so busy in Darkness was to be understood those  Gratifications  impudently call'd  Pensions  by Persons disaffected to the Ministry That for Example the largest of such pretended Pensions were represented under the Similitude of  Boats which had Sails and Oars together  Middling Pensions were  Boats with many Oars  Smaller still were  OneOar'd Barks  The least of all were  Polemen  And as for the  naked Waders  it was by this Time become  clear to my own unassisted Capacity that they could mean nothing but those poor Souls who were neglected by the  black Bustler  and had no Pensions at all to take Boat with  My ingenious Friend the Lawyer advis'd me to write a Letter to the Great Man who had made so light of a good Subject's Information and put him in Mind of the Fate of  Philotas  He added that the Fears of Statesmen would be more awake for their Masters if less watchful for Themselves He was sorry he was then in Haste but invited me next Morning to his Chambers where he assured me no Assistance in his Power should be wanting to  make something  of the Matter we had been conferring on  How admirable is the Penetration of some Men's Spirits and how powerful the good Influence of their ExampleI who before I had received this Light could see no Tendency to such seditious Purpose in the Manuscript so providentially  decypher'd  could now in every Page of it discover the clearest and most visible  Disaffection  Nay I have since that Time upon frequent Revisal of the Libel under Help of better Eyes than my own found  Popery  in it as well as  Jacobitism  Not to mention that the  Pope  's Name Itself in great Letters stands audaciously written at the End of it  I sent a Copy with a Recital of all the foregoing Particulars to my Boy beforemention'd  who is now of three Years standing at the College where I fear his Political Principles have been newmodell'd since I saw him for he seems a little  Malepert  in a Letter he return'd me for Answer which however in Justice to the good Parts of the Youth I take Pleasure in Publishing not supposing the Childish Mistake it turns upon capable of making any Impression upon Readers who  know the World  and are acquainted with  Men  and  Business  Honour'd Sir  I Am sorry to say I was asham'd of your Account concerning the Manuscript you demand my Thoughts of It is no other than a  Satire  written by  One  Poet on the Misapplication of  Another's  GeniusYou apprehended it to mean  more  than the Author design'd by finding it say  less  than the Reader expected But Scurrility and Grossness are so far from being  Requisites  in  Satire  that it can be no  true Satire  in which they are to be met with The Force of these Writings consists in their  Smiling  and whenever they grow  angry  they bring a Storm over their own Sunshine which like the Frown of incens'd Beauty loses more by Abatement of Influence than is gain'd from Accession of Rigour  The  Pope  at the End of the Poem ought to give you no Jealousy He is none of his  Holyness  at  Rome  but an  English  I had almost said  Protestant Pope  of this Nation's own Breeding He wears indeed a  Triple Crown  like the other but it is of  Musick Painting  and  Poetry  Nothing is more easily perceived than that this Satire is the Consequence of some Pieces lately publish'd which savour to say Truth of a Sensibility too like  Levity  in a Mind so rich as His who is reputed their Author But I cannot without Pleasure observe the Influence of acknowledg'd Merit confining Satire to his  Folly  without allowing it to attack his  Wit  which is not weaker tho' less lovely when it stains itself upon a dirty Subject than when it ornaments Beauty itself and adds Magnificence to Palaces  It is an  Art  to  trifle importantly  and even to  trifle agreeably  has its Attraction But to trifle unseasonably indecently or improperly let who will be the Trifler must be either inhumane or unguardedEither wrong Judgment or Illbreeding  What Pity that the warmest of a certain Gentleman's Admirers are lately forc'd to confess there are  Grossnesses  in some of his Sallies obscene enough to blot out any Wit but their Author's  Insults  low enough to become the most vulgarspirited among his Enemies  And  Malice  animated enough to be beautiful in any of his Friends but Himself  It gives however a Kind of illnatur'd Comfort to us who are his  distant Cotemporaries  that among Virtues which we must despair of equalling we discover Errors which we disdain to imitateSo pray Sir commit the Poem to the Press and let it travel in Search of its Author who will hardly look for it in  Your  Hands and by that Means it may be lost to the Publick  THE PROGRESS  of  WIT A CAVEAT  _TUNEFUL ALEXIS on the  Thame  's fair Side  The Ladies Plaything and the Muses Pride  With

watry Spray  That rain'd in gemmy Showers and dazled Day  High on the painted Stern a Youth appear'd  Who rather  happily  than  strongly  steer'd  Faint and unstriking was his anguish'd Mien  Sadden'd by Sickness and o'ercast with Spleen  Yet from his Eyes there beam'd a living Light  Keen and intent as a fir'd Eagle's Sight  And from his Voice for as he sail'd he  sung  Such magick Sounds

try'd  Steering from Isle to Isle with joyless Awe  Thin o'er each Height their whiterob'd Lords he saw  Pleas'd without Transport bow the Palms they bore  To hail his Passage near their silent Shore  Cold  and  uncharm'd  he sought his favourite Croud  Immensely distant now tho' late so loud  All was serene the Air was hush'd around  The Waters calmLost even  His  Musick's Sound  Back to the Left impatient Looks he cast  And long'd for every shining Insect past  Distant he saw them Wings o'er Wings display  And in light Chases thread the colour'd Ray  Eager for these contending Pilots strove

warr'd revengeful on their falling Wings  Thro' Dust of slaughter'd  Gnats  he fought in Shade  And squeez'd them deathful on the Wounds they made  Fleets of cold Opposites from all Sides join  And wedg'd against this general Foe combine  Vainly  indignant they resist his Sway  Yet block his Passage and obstruct his Way  Still tho' he stagnates he the Fight maintains  While Drones applausive
