 TO  DAVID GARRICK  Esq  SIR  AMIDST the regrets I feel for your quitting the Stage it is peculiarly gratifying that a Play of  mine  closes your  dramatic  lifeIt is the highest pleasure to me that  that  Play from its success reflects no dishonour on your judgement as a Manager  Posterity will know thro' a thousand Channels that Mr GARRICK was the ornament of the eighteenth Century that he possessed the friendship of those whose Names will be the glory of English History that the first ranks in the kingdom courted his societymay my small voice be heard amongst those who will inform it that Mr GARRICK's  Heart  was no less an honour to him than his  Talents  Unpatronized by any  name  I presented myself to you obscure and unknown You perceived  dawnings  in my Comedy which you  nourish'd  and  improved  With attention and sollicitude you  embellish'd  and presented it to the world  that  World which has emulated your generosity and received it with an applause which fills my heart with most lively gratitude I perceive how much of this applause I owe to my  Sex  The RUNAWAY has a thousand faults which if written by a Man would have incurred the severest lash of Criticismbut the Gallantry of the English Nation is equal to its Wisdomthey beheld  a  Woman  tracing with feeble steps the borders of the Parnaffian Mountpitying her difficulties for 'tis a thorny path they gave their hands for her support and placed her  high  above her level  All this Sir and whatever may be its consequences I owe to you Had you rejected me when I presented my little RUNAWAY depressed by the refusal and all confidence in  myself  destroyed I should never have presumed to dip my pen again It is now my task to convince You and the World that a generous allowance for a young Writer's faults is the best encouragement to Genius'tis a kindly Soil in which weak Groundlings are nourish'd and from which the loftiest Trees draw their strength and their beauty  I take my leave of you Sir with the warmest wishes for your felicity and Mrs GARRICK'sto whose  taste  and sollicitede for me I am highly indebted May your recess from the Stage be attended with all the blessings of retirement and easeand may the world remember in its most distant periods that 'tis to Mr GARRICK the English Theatre owes its emancipation from grossness and buffoonerythat to Mr GARRICK's  Judgement  it is indebted for being the first Stage in Europe and to his  Talents  for being the delight of the most enlightened and polish'd age  I am Sir your most devoted and obedient humble Servant THE AUTHOR  PROLOGUE  Written by the  AUTHOR  Spoken by  MR BRERETON  O The sweet prospect what a fine Parterre  Soft buds sweet flowers bright tints and scented air  Boxes  A Vale where critic wit spontaneous grows  Pit  A Hill which  noise  and  folly  never knows  Gallery  Let Cits point out green paddocks to their spouses  To me no prospect like your crouded houses  If as just now you wear those smiles enchanting  But when you frown my heart you set a panting  Pray then for pity do not frown tonight  I'll bribebut howOh now I've hit itright  Secrets are pleasant to each child of Eve  I've one in store which for your smiles I'll give  O list a tale it is not very common  Our Poet of tonight in faith's aWoman  A woman too untutor'd in the School  Nor Aristotle knows nor scarce a rule  By which fine writers fabricate their plays  From sage Menander's to these modern days  How she could venture here I am astonish'd  But 'twas in vain the Madcap I admonish'd  Told her of squeaking catcalls hisses groans  Off offs and ruthless Critics' damning moans  I'm undismay'd she cry'd critics are Men  And smile on folly from a Woman's pen  Then 'tis the Ladies' cause there I'm secure  Let him who hisses no soft Nymph endure  May he who frowns be frown'd on by his Goddess  From Pearls and Brussels Point to Maids in Boddice  Now for a hint of her intended feast  'Tis rural playfulharmless 'tis at least  Not overstock'd with repartee or wit  Tho' here and there  perchance  there is a hit  For she ne'er play'd with bright Apollo's fire  No Muse invok'd or heard th' AÃ¶nian lyre  Her Comic Musea little blueey'd maid  With cheeks where innocence and health's display'd  Her 'Polin petticoatsa romping Boy  Whose taste is trapball and a kite his joy  Her Nursery the study where she thought  Fram'd fable incident surprise and plot  From the surrounding hints she caught her plan  Length'ning the chain from infancy to man  Tom plagues poor Fan she sobs but loves him still  Kate aims her wit at both with roguish skill  Our Painter mark'd those lineswhich Nature drew  Her fancy glow'd and colour'd themfor you  A Mother's pencil gave the light and shades  A Mother's eye thro' each soft scene pervades  Her Children rose before her flatter'd view  Hope stretch'd the canvas whilst her wishes drew  We'll now present you drapery and features  And warmly hope you'll like the pretty creatures  Then Tom shall have his kite and Fan new dollies  Till time matures them for  important  follies"  The dotted lines in the Play are omitted at the Theatre  EPILOGUE  Written

painful assiduities by which we obtain their favourTheir  true  lovers are never satiated with the pleasures they bestowthose indeed who court them like the Toasts of the season  because  it is the

to itYou being a grave orderly man and having a couple of decent wellbehaved young women for a Daughter and Niece I think she will be more agreeably protected hereand this is my business  Mr H  A young Lady who hath put herself under your protection Who is she  Mr D  Her name she wishes to conceal  Mr H  That's very oddWhere did you meet with her  Mr D  At the house of a Widow Tenant of mine a few miles from hence where she had taken refuge from a marriage to which an Uncle would have forced herShe had no companion but the good old Lady whom I found employed in assisting her to weep instead of consoling herIn short there were  reasons  to think her situation highly dangerous and I prevail'd on her to leave it  Har  And so your credulity is again taken in and the air of a weeping Beauty

George'Sbud refuse protection to a fine Girl'twould be with you a crying Sin I warrantbut Mr Drummond I should suppose  Mr D  Come be satisfied the weaknesses with which you reproach me might have

person of creditShe has dispatched a messenger to her Uncle who I presume will be here tomorrow  Har  Pray Sir permit us to wait on the Lady and conduct her here I am strongly interested for her  Mr H  'Tis an odd affairwhat say you to it my Lady  Lady D  As your Family seem desirous to receive her Sir I am sorry to perceive an impropriety in the requestbut I should apprehend that any appearance of encouragement to young Ladies in  disobedience  particularly when accompanied with the glaring indecorum of an elopement  Mr H  Aye very true'Sbud Mr Drummond how can you encourage such  Mr D  Madam I do not mean to encourage but to restore the young Lady to her family She seems terrified at the peculiar severity of her Uncle's temper so we'll put ourselves in form receive him in full assembly and

ho then I suppose he only pointed the game for youSweet Sir your humbleAfter College commons a coarser dish than Pheasant I think might have gone down  Geo  Your whip Siryour bit wants lashing To talk thus of Mr Drummond whom you  do  know is not more insolent than your profanation of a Lady whom you do  not  know  Third Gent  O cry you mercyPlague take me if I quarrel for any wench in EnglandYou are heartily welcome to her Sir only I hope another time you'll be honest and hunt without a stalkinghorse  Exit  Geo  Barbarian How critically did Mr Drummond relieve the lovely GirlThis brute had discovered her and she would have suffered every indignity that Ignorance supported by the pride of Fortune could have inflicted In the gardenthat's fortunate beyond my expectations'midst groves and fountainsthe very scene where a lover should tell his taleand the sweet consciousness which beamed in her eyes last night flatters me that she will not  hate  me for my taleI'll go in all the confidence of hope  Exit  SCENE  the Garden  Enter  EMILY  Em  What an heavenly morningsurely'tis in England that Summer keeps her courtfor she's no where else so lovelyAnd what a sweet garden this isBut tell me my heartis it the brightness of the morning the verdure of the garden the melody of the birds that gives thee these enchanting sensationsAh noit is that thou hast found thy Lordit is that I have again seen the Man who since I first beheld him has been the only image in my mindHow different from the empty the presuming Baldwinyet I owe  him  this obligationif his hateful perseverance had not forced me from London I might never have seen but once the Man who  that once  possess'd himself of my tenderest wishesHa  starting  Enter  GEORGE  Geo  Abroad so early Madamthe fine Ladies in London are yet in their first sleep  Em  It would have been impossible to have resisted the chearful call of the Hunters if the morning had been less enticing  Geo  Oh do not imagine yourself obliged to the Hunters Madam it was my good GeniusI thank herthat inspired them and did me the favour to lead me here  Em  If she usually influences you to no better purpose her claims to your gratitude are but weak  Geo  'Till lately I thought so and supposed myself influenced by the worst Genius that ever fell to the lot of a poor mortalbut she has entirely retrieved herself in my opinion and by two or three capital strokes has made me forget her unlucky pranks and believe her one of the best disposed Sylphs in all the regions of Fancy  Em  smiling  You recommend this aÃ«rial attendant very stronglyHave you any intention to part from her  Geo  I would willingly exchange herif your Genius would be so obliging to take a fancy to meI'll accept her with all my heartand give you mine  Em  You wou'd lose by the exchange  Geo  Impossiblefor my quondam friend would say a thousand things for me that I could not for myselfso I should gain your good opinionand that would be  well gained  whatever I might lose to attain it  Em  Your Genius is at least a gallant one I perceivebut  I was on the point of leaving the garden SirThe Ladies I imagine are risen by this time  Geo  Indeed they are not but if they shouldthese are precious moments which I must not losemay I presume to use them in telling you how happy I am in the event which placed you in my Father's housebut you have perhaps forgot the presumptuous Tancred who gave such disturbance to the Gentleman honour'd by protecting you at the Masquerade  Em  No Sir I rememberand if I don't mistake you were nearly engaged in a  fracas  with that GentlemanI was happy when I observ'd you stopt by a mask and seized that moment to leave the room  Geo  A moment Madam that I have never ceas'd to regret 'till nowbut  that  which I at present possess is a felicity so unexpected and unhop'd for  Em  You forget Sir these gallantries are out of place hereunder a mask a Shepherd may sigh or an Eastern Prince amuse himself in saying the most extravagant thingsbut they know there are delicacies to be observed in real life quite incompatible with the freedoms of a Masquerade  Geo  Whilst you are thus severe on mere gallantries I will venture to hope that a most tender and respectful passion will be treated more favourably  Em  Sir  Geo  I comprehend Madam what your delicacy must feel and will therefore only add that from the first moment I beheld you my heart has known no other object  You  have been the Mistress of its Wishesand you  are  the Mistress of its Fate  Em  hesitatingly  Indeed Sir this declaration at a time when I must appear in so strange a light to your family hurts me greatlyI can scarcely believe you mean it a complimentbut surely my situation here ought  Geo  I acknowledge Madam the confession I have dared to make is prematureit is ill timednothing can excuse it but the peculiarity of our situationWhen I reflect that in a few moments your Uncle may arrive that he may snatch you from us and that such an opportunity never may be mine again  Enter Mr  Drummond  Mr D  So so my young ones have I found you 'tis a most delicious morningbut is it usual with you Madam to taste the air so early  Em  Yes Sirin the Country at leastI seldom murder such hours in sleep  Mr D  Aye 'tis to that practice you are indebted for the roses in your cheeksWhat I suppose you brought the Lady into the garden George to read her a iecture on Vegetationto explain the nature and cause of Heator perhaps more abstracted subjects have engaged  Geo  Stop dear SirI assure you I am not abstracted enough to enter on these subjects with such an object before meI found the Lady here and had scarcely paid her my morning compliments when you appeared  Mr D  For which you do not thank me I presumebut come Madam you are  my  ward 'till I have the pleasure of presenting you to your Uncle and I come to conduct you to breakfast George you may follow but take care you keep your distance  Exeunt Mr  D  and  Emily  Geo  Distanceas well might you persuade the shadow to forsake its Sun or erring mortals give up hopes of mercy  With what sweet confidence she gives her hand to Mr Drummondif

Susan  It appear'd so my Lady as I saw them from the windowhe looked eagerly in her face and she blush'd and seem'd confused  Lady D  Confused indeedyes so the Impertinent affected to appear last nighttho' it was evident she had neither eyes nor thoughts but for Mr Hargrave's Sonwho paid her those attentions which from the present habits of life are paid to  every  Womantho' I think Mr George Hargrave should be superior to these modern gallantries  Sus  I dares to say she is some impostorHusbands in good truth are not so plenty that a woman need run away to escape one  Lady D  I have no doubt of her being a low personand as to her prettiness 'tis of the kind one sees in wooden Dollscherrycolour cheeks and eyes that from the total absence of expression might be taken for glass  Sus  I wonder Mr Hargrave did not stand by his own opinion and let her stay where she was but whatever Mr Drummond says is law here  Lady D  Because Mr Hargrave imagines he'll make his Son his heirbut if he does he'll only share with the paupers of the neighbouring villages for these Mr Drummond seems to consider his family and I am mistaken if he does n't find it a pretty expensive one  Sus  Oh Ma'am he believes every melancholy tale that's told him as a proof of his pietyHere's the Bow my Ladybut as he fancies her prettyness was in danger he had better have kept her in his own house and stood guard himself  Lady D  Ayethat employment or any other that would keep him at home might be usefulWant of rest  looking in the glass  absolutely transforms methe detestable Horns and their noisy accompanyment waked me from the most delightful dreamHow do I look today Susan  Sus  Oh charmingly my Lady  Lady D  'Tis a most provoking circumstance the colour of my hair should be so soon changedbut Mrs Gibson's Liquid entirely hides that accident I believe  Sus  Entirely my Ladyand then her Bloom it is impossible to distinguish from nature  Lady D  You need not speak so loud In compliance with the custom of modern times a woman is forced to keep the use of these sort of things as secretly as she would an Illegitimate Birth It was not so among the AntientsThe Roman Ladies made a point of excelling in Arts of this kind and the Empress Poppea was not ashamed to carry in her train five hundred Asses in whose milk she bathed every morning for the benefit of her complexion  Sus  Five hundred Asses in one Lady's trainthank Heaven we have no such engrossing nowadays  our  Toasts have all their full share  Lady D  Indeed Mrs Susan  half smiling  this wench has ideas Pray what do you think of the young Collegian  Sus  Oh my Lady he is the sweetest smartest ManI think he is exactly like the picture of your Ladyship's Brother that died when he was eighteen  Lady D  People used to say  that  Brother and myself bore a strong resemblance  Sus  I dare to say you did my Lady for there's something in the turn of young Mr Hargrave's face vastly like your Ladyship's  laughing behind her  Lady D  Well SusanI believe I may trust youI think you can be faithful  Sus  Most surely my LadyI would rather die than betray your Ladyship  Lady D  Well thenI protest I hardly know how to acknowledge itBut  Susan  But what my Ladyyour Ladyship alarms me  Lady D  I too am alarm'dbut I know your faith  sighs  There will soon be a most intimate and never to be dissolved

preserve your spirits Bella that you keep your heart so cold  Bel  The recipe is certainly not a bad one if we may judge from the effects of the opposite element on  your  spiritsbut I advise you whatever you do not to assume an appearance of gravity'tis the most dangerous character in the world  Geo  How so  Bel  Oh the advantages you would lose by it are inconconceivable While you can sustain that of a giddy thoughtless undesigning  great Boy  all the impertinent and foolish things you commit will be excus'dlaugh'd atnay if accompanied by a certain manner they will be applaudedbut

presumed to make her anymy fortune was so small that I had no hopes of obtaining your Father's consentand therefore made it a point of honour not to endeavour to gain her affection  Geo  Yes yes you took great care  aside  Sir Ch  But my Uncle's death having removed every cause of fear on that head I flatter'd myself I had nothing else to apprehend  Geo  Courage my friend and your difficulties

advancement of your fortune says I and if it can't satisfy your mind you must teach it what I have always taught youobedience  Enter  GEO  Oh George I sent for you into the garden that we might have no interruptions for as I was saying there's an affair of consequence I want to talk to you about  Geo  I am all attention Sir  Mr H  I don't design that you shall return to College any moreI have other views which I hope will not be disagreeable to youYouyou like Lady Dinah you say  Geo  hesitatingly  She is a Lady of great erudition without doubt  Mr H  I don't know what your notions may be of her age I could wish her a few years younger but  Geo  Pardon me Sir I think there can be no objection to her age and the preference her Ladyship gives to our family is certainly a high compliment  Mr H  Ho ho then you are acquainted already with what I was going to communicate to youI am surprised at that  Geo  Matrimonial negotiations Sir are seldom long concealed 'tis a subject on which every body is fond of talkingthe young in hopes that their turn will comeand those who are older  Mr H  By way of giving a fillip to their memories I suppose you mean George chwell I am glad you are so merry I was a little uneasy about what you might think of this affairtho' I never mention'd it in my lifebut perhaps Lady Dinah may have hinted it to her woman and then I should not wonder if the whole parish knew it However you have no objection and that's enoughtho' if you had I must have had my way George  Geo  Without doubt Sir  Mr H  Have you spoken to Lady Dinah on the subject  Geo  Spokeno Sir I could not think of addressing Lady Dinah on so delicate an affair without your permission  Mr H  Well then my dear BoyI would have you speak to her now and I think the sooner the better

have gall'd me sorely if you had been against itbut you are a good Boy George a very good Boy and I'll go in and prepare Lady Dinah for your visit  Exit  Geo  Why my dear Father you are quite elated on the prospect of your nuptialsbut why must  I  make speeches to Lady Dinah I am totally ignorant of the mode that elderly Gentlemen adopt on such occasions  Enter  BELLA  Bel  What have you been opening your heart to your Father George  Geo  No faithhe has been opening his to meHe has been making me the confident of his passion for Lady Dinah  Bel  No ha ha hais it possiblewhat style does he talk in is it flames and darts or esteem and sentiment  Geo  I don't imagine my good Father thinks of eitherher fortune I presume is his object and I shall not venture to hint an objection for contradiction you know only lends him fresh ardor Where is Seymour and Harriet  Bel  Your Sister is in the drawingroom and Sir Charles I just now saw in the Orangewalk with his arms folded thusand his eyes fixt on a shrub in the most  penseroso  style you can conceiveWhyhe has no appearance of a happy youth on the verge of Bridegroomism  Geo  Ha ha ha ha  Bel  Why do you laugh  Geo  At the embarrasment I have thrown the simpletons intoha ha ha  Bel  What simpletonswhat embarrasment  Geo  That you cannot guess my sweet Cousin with all your penetration  Bel  I shall expire if you won't

one anotherand I have made each believe that the other has different engagements  Bel  Oh I am rejoiced to hear it  Geo  Rejoic'd I assure you I am highly offended  Bel  At what Sir Charles is your friend and every way an eligible match for your Sister  Geo  Very trueI am happy in their attachment and therefore offendedSir Charles has been as chary of his secret as if I had not deserv'd his confidence  Bel  I believe he never address'd your Sister  Geo  Aye so he pretends he never made love to herridiculous subterfugehe stole into her heart by the help of those silent tender observances which are the surest battery when there's time to play 'em offIf any man had  thus  obtain'd my Sister's heartleft her a prey to disappointment  and then said  he meant nothing  my sword should have faught him that his conduct was not less dishonourable than if he had knelt at her feet and sworn a million oaths  Bel  Why this might be usefulbut mercy upon us if every girl had such a snapdragon of a Brotherno Beausand very few pretty fellows would venture to come near herpray when did you form this mischievous design  Geo  Oh Sir Charles has been heaping up the measure of his offences some time'twould have diverted you to have seen the tricks he play'd to get Harriet's pictureAt last he begg'd it to get the drapery copied for his Sister's and I know 'tis at this moment in his bosom tho' he has sworn an hundred times 'tis still at the Painter's  Bel  HaI'll fly and tell her the newsIf I don't mistake she'd rather have her picture there than in the Gallery of Beauties at Hampton  going  Geo  SdeathstopWhy are not you angryshut out by parchment provisoes from all the flutters of Courtship yourselfyou had a right to participate in Harriet's  Bel  Very true this might be sufficient for  me  But what pleasure can  you  have in tormenting two hearts so attach'd to each other  Geo  I do mean to plague 'em a little and it will be the greatest favour we can do themfor they are such sentimental peopleyou knowthat they'll blush and hesitate and torment each other six months before they can come to an explanationBut by alarming their jealousy they'll betray themselves in as many hours  Bel  Oh cry your mercySo there's not one grain of mischief in all this and you carry on the plan in downright charitywell really in that light there is some reason  Geo  Aye more reason than is necessary to induce you to join in iteven tho' there were mischiefso promise me your assistance with a good grace  Bel  Well I do promise for I really think  Geo  Oh I'll accept of very slight assurances  Bel  Apropos Here's HarrietI'm just as angry as you wish me leave us and you shall have a good account of her  Enter  HARRIET  Har  Brother Mr Drummond I fancy wonders at your absence he's alone with the Lady  Geo  Then he possesses a privilege that half mankind would grudge him  Exit  Bel  Have you seen Sir Charles yet  Har  Indeed I have notI confess I was so weak as to retire twice from the drawingroom because I heard his voicetho' I was conscious my absence must appear odd and fearful the cause might be suspected  Bel  Ahpray be careful that you give  him  in particular no reason to guess at thatI advise you to treat him with the greatest coldness  Har  Most certainly I shall whatever it costs meIt would be the most cruel mortification if I thought he would ever suspect my weaknessI wonder Bella if the Lady whom he is to marry is so handsome as George describes her  Bel  Of what consequence is that to you childnever think about it if you suffer your mind to be soften'd with reflections of that sort you'll never behave with a proper degree of scorn to him  Har  Oh do not fear it I assure you I possess a vast deal of scorn for him  Bel  I am sure you fib  aside  Well now by way of example he is coming this way I see  Har  Is hecome then let us go  Bel  Yes yes you are quite a Heroine I perceiveSurely you will not fly to prove your indifferenceStay and mortify him with an appearance of carelessness and goodhumourFor instance when he appears look at him with such an unmeaning eye as one glances over an acquaintance shabbily dress'd at Ranelaghand when he speaks to you look another way and then suddenly recollecting yourselfWhat is that you were saying Sir Charles I beg pardon I really did not attendthen without minding his answerBella I was thinking of that sweet fellow who open'd the ball with Lady HarrietDid you ever see such eyes and then the air with which he dancedO Lord I never shall forget him  Har  You'll find me a bad scholar I

left HargravePlace  confused'y  Har  I never have been better Sir and my spirits are seldom so good as they are now  affecting gaiety  Sir Cha  Your looks indeed Madam speak you in possession of that happiness I wish you  sighing  You Miss Sydney are always in spirits  Bel  In general SirI have not wisdom enough to be troubled with reflections to destroy my repose  Sir Cha  Do you imagine it then a proof of wisdom to be unhappy  Bel  One might think so for wise folks are always grave  Har  Then I'll never attempt to be wisehenceforward I'll be gaiety itselfI am de  ermined to devote myself to pleasure and only live to laugh  Bel  Perhaps you may not always find subjects Cousin unless you do as I dolaugh at your own absurdities  Har  Oh fear notwe need not always look at home the world abounds with subjects for mirth and the men will be so obliging as to furnish a sufficient number when every other resource fails  Sir Cha  Miss Hargrave was not always so severe  Har  Fye Sir Charlesdo not mistake pleasanty for severitybut exuberant spirits frequently overflow in impertinence therefore I pardon your thinking that mine do  Sir Cha  Impertinence Surely Madam you cannot suppose I meant to  Har  Nay Bella I appeal to you did not Sir Charles intimate some such thing  Bel  WhyaI don't knowTo be sure there was a kind of a distant intimationtho' perhaps Sir Charles only means that you are aukwardha haBut consider Sir this character of Harriet's is but lately assumedand new characters like new stays never sit till they have been worn  Sir Cha  Very well Ladies I will not dispute your right to understand my expressions in what manner you pleasebut I hope you will allow me the sameand that when a Lady's eyes speak disdain I may without offence translate it into Love  Har  'Tis an error that men are apt to fall into but the eyes talk in an idiom warm from the heart and so skilful an observer as Sir Charles will not mistake their language  Sir Cha  Are they alike intelligible to all  Har  So plain that nine times out of ten at least mistakes must be wilful  Sir Ch  Then pray examine mine Madam and by the  port you make I shall judge of your proficiency in their dialect  Bella  OhI'll examine yours Sir CharlesI am a better judge than Harrietlet me seeaye'tis so in one I perceive love and jealousyin the other hope and a wedding Now am I not a Prophetess

sweetnessthat dovelike softness which stole into my heart and deceived me into dreams of bliss She flies from me and talks of her company and returning to her societyOh Harriet oh my Harriet thy society is prized by me beyond that of the whole world and still to possess it with the hope that once glowed in my bosom would be a blessing for which I would sacrifice every other that Nature or

Hargravepardon mebut you have certainly been too precipitateyour Son has scarcely been at home four and twenty hours and cannot possibly have received any impression or formed an idea of my characterHe has been so much engaged indeed with other persons that I have had no opportunity of conversing with him and how so circumstanced can he have form'd a judgment of his own heart  Mr H  Good God Madam he has given the best proof in the world that he has formed a judgment for he told me this morning that the prospect of the marriage made him very happyI don't know what other proof a man can give that he knows his own heartand let me tell you Madam I have accustomed my children to pay a proper regard to my inclination  Lady D  I am apprehensive Sir that Mr George Hargrave's obedience may influence him more than I cou'd wishand I assure you I cannot think of uniting myself to any man who does not prefer me for my own sake without adverting to any other consideration  Mr H  His obedience to me influence him more than you could wishwhy really I don't understand you my LadyZounds I thought she had been a sensible Woman  aside  Lady D  Not understand me Mr Hargrave I have too high an opinion of your good sense to suppose that I am unintelligible to you  Mr H  My opinion Madam is that an obedient Son is likely to make a kind HusbandGeorge is a fine young fellow as any in England though I his father say itand there's not a woman in the kingdom who might not be proud to call him her husbandtoo obedient  Lady D  Bless me this man has no ideas  aside  You mistake me Mr

H  Well well MadamI allow this is a topic on which a Lady does not chuse to explain herself but to the principalI waited on your Ladyship only to inform you that I had talked to my Son concerning the affair and to incline you when he waits on you to give him a favourable hearing  Lady D  Mr Hargravea person of your Son's merit is  entitled  to a proper attention from any Woman he addresses  Mr H  Therenow we are right againI was fearful that you had not liked my Boyand that your difficulties arose from that quarterbut since you like George 'tis all very well very well  Lady D  Mr HargraveI am surprised at your conceiving so unjust an ideaMr George Hargrave is as you have said a match for any woman whatever be her rank  Mr H  My dear Lady DinahI am quite happy to hear you say soI am sure

distressingbut I intreat you to be composedI hope you will have no reason to regret a resolution which myself and the rest of the family have so much cause to rejoice inand I assure your Ladyship every thing on my part that can contribute to your felicity you shall always command  Lady D  You are very  polite  SirWe have had so little opportunity of conversing Mr Hargrave that I am afraid you express rather your Father's sentiments than your own It is impossible indeed from so short a knowledge that you can have formed any sentiments of me yourself  Geo  Pardon me Madam my sentiments for you are full of respectand I am convinced your qualities will excite the veneration of all who have the honour of being connected with you My Father could hardly have done it better  aside  Lady D  Why this young Man has certainly been taught to make love by his Tutor at College  aside  Geo  I am concerned this visit seems so embarrassing to your LadyshipI certainly should have deferr'd it from an apprehension of its being disagreeable but in obedience to my Father I  Lady D  Then it is to your Father Sir that I am indebted for the favour of seeing you  Geo  By no means Madamit would certainly have been my  inclination  to have waited on your Ladyship but my Father's wishes induced me to hasten it  Lady D  Really a pretty extraordinary confession  aside  I think it necessary to assure you Sir thatthat this affair has been brought thus forward by Mr Hargraveand the proposals he made in which it was evident  his whole heart  was concern'd were quite unexpected  Geo  I have not the least doubt of it Madam nor am I at all surprised at my Father's earnestness on a subject so interestingWhat can she mean by apologizing to me  aside  Lady D  It would certainly have been proper Sir to have allowed you time to have formed a judgment yourself on a point which coucerns you so highly  Geo  The time has been quite sufficient MadamI highly approve the steps my Father has takenbut if I did not the respect I bear to his determination would certainly have prevented my opposing them I must end this extraordinary visit  aside  Shall I have the honour of conducting your Ladyship to the Company  Lady D  No SirI have some orders to give my Woman I'll rejoin the Ladies in a few minutes  Geo  Then I'll wish your Ladyship a good morning  Ex  Lady D  Amazement why what a visit from a LoverIs this the language in which men usually talk to women with whom they are on the point of marriageRespect Veneration Obedience to my FatherAnd shall I have the honour of conducting your Ladyship to the CompanyA pretty Loverlike request trulyBut this coldness to me proceeds from a cause I now understandThis morning what fire was there in his eyes what animation in his countenance whenever he address'd himself to that creature Mr Drummond brought hereWould his request to her have been to conduct her to CompanyNo noBut I must be cautiousI must be patient nowbut you will find Sir when I

is not youthful enough for George I suppose  Mr D  Truebut a more forcible objection is the disproportion in their mindsit wou'd not be less reasonable to expect a new element to be produced between earth and fire than that felicity shou'd be the result of such a marriage  Mr H  Psha pshawhat do you suppose the whole world has the same idle notions about love and constancy and stuff that you have D'ye think if George was to become a widower at five and twenty  he'd  whine all his life for the loss of his deary  Mr D  Not if his deary as you call her should be a Lady Dinah and if you marry him

would not have borne the distress she now enduresI will be a father to his orphan Emily and ensure the felicity of two children on the point of being sacrificed to the ambition and avarice of those on
