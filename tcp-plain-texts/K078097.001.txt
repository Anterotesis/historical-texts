Persians vanquish'd Greece from bondage sav'd  The death of great Leonidas aveng'd  By Attic virtuecelebrate O Muse  A burning ray the summer solstice cast  Th' Olympiad was proclaim'd when Xerxes pour'd  His millions through Thermopylae newstain'd  With blood From Athens Aeschylus divine  In genius arts and valour musing deep  On his endanger'd country's future doom  Repairs invited by an evening still  To clear Ilissus Attic stream renown'd  Beneath an oak in solitary state  Apart itself a wood the hero's limbs  On tufted moss repose He grasps the lyre  Unfolded scrolls voluminous he spreads  Along the ground high lays repeating thence  Leonidas the Spartan he extols  And sweeps th' accordant strings To closing day  He bade farewel and hail'd th' ascending stars  In music long continued till the stream  With drowsy murmur won his eye to sleep  But left his fancy waking In a dream  The god of day with full meridian blaze  Seem'd to assume his function o'er the skies  When lo the earth divided through the cleft  A gush of radiance dimm'd the noontide sun  In structure all of diamond self pois'd  Amid redundant light a chariot hung  Triumphal Twelve transparent horses breath'd  Beams from their nostrils dancing beams of day  Shook from their manes In lineaments of man  Chang'd to immortal there the mighty soul  Of Sparta's king apparent shone His wounds  Shot forth a splendour like the clust'ring stars  Which on Orion's chest and limbs proclaim  Him first of constellations Round in cars  Of triumph too arrang'd the stately forms  Of those whom virtue led to share his doom  And consecrate Thermopylae to fame  Pines tipp'd with lightning seem'd their spears their shields  Broad like Minerva's aegis from their helms  An empyreal brightness stream'd abroad  Ineffable felicity their eyes  Their fronts the majesty of gods display'd  Erect the glorious shape began to speak  In accents louder than a bursting cloud  Pentelicus Hymettus seem'd to shake  Through all their quarries and Ilissus beat  His shudd'ring banks in tumultThou whose muse  Commands th' immortalizing trump of fame  Go to the sage Hellanodics the just  Elēan judges of Olympian palms  There in thy own celestial strains rehearse  Before that concourse wide our deeds and fate  Let our example general Greece inspire  To face her danger let the Spartan shield  Protect th' Athenians else I died in vain  The brilliant vision now dispersing leaves  The wond'ring bard He starting in his ken  Discerns no other than the real scene  Of shadows brown from close embow'ring wood  Than distant mountains and the spangled face  Of heav'n reflected from the silver stream  But pensive brooding o'er his country's fate  His step he turns Themistocles who rul'd  Athenian councils instant he accosts  With large recital of his awful dream  Obey the mandate cries the chief alarm  Th' Olympian concourse from the Delphian port  Of Cirrha sail for Elis on thy way  Consult Apollo in the state's behalf  Which to that function nominates thy worth  Of Xerxes' march intelligence obtain  This said they parted Aeschylus by dawn  Commenc'd his progress join'd by numbers arm'd  Like him to Pisa's barrier destin'd all  Electing him their chief Five times the sun  Renew'd his orbit five successive nights  The moon enlarg'd her crescent ere they reach'd  Phoebean Delphi seated on a rock  Abrupt sublime Yet thence the curious eye  Must upward look to meet the summits blue  Of doubletopp'd Parnassus where the god  Oracular is worshipp'd Here they trac'd  Barbarian violence profane Consum'd  Were hamlets temples levell'd to the dust  The statues broken each religious bow'r  A burning mass of embers Wrapt in smoke  With cinders strewn so glows the region round  Portentous Aetna or Vesuvius dire  Death's flaming cauldrons when their stony ribs  And min'ral bowels liquefied by fire  O'erwhelm the fields by nature left unbless'd  Alone unbless'd of all Sicania's bound  Or lovelyfac'd Hesperia Dubious here  Th' Athenians halt while fierce the sultry noon  Inflames the sky From Delphi's open gates  To Attic eyes no stranger Timon comes  Sage priest of Phoebus magistrate unsoil'd  The public host of Athens to the plain  Descending swift with followers who bear  His buckler spear and armour On his head  Were ashes sprinkled rent his garb presag'd  Some black disaster What malignant dart  Of fortune wounds thee Aeschylus aloud  While by the hand Cecropia's host he press'd  To him the Delphian From deserted roofs  Depopulated streets I come to hail  Thee bound by hospitable ties my friend  Thee dear to Phoebus by Minerva grac'd  Thy country's goddess Me thou often saw'st  A parent bless'd in Amarantha's bloom  Yet ripe in virtue Her presenting pray'r  With votive flow'rs before Minerva's shrine  This very hour Barbarians have enthrall'd  Borne in my sight precipitate away  O wife lamented gather'd in thy prime  By ruthless Pluto in Elysian groves  How shall I meet thee and the tidings bear  Of thy lost child to servitude a prey  To violation doom'd Yet more the rage  Of these invaders who have spoil'd our fields  Defac'd our temples driv'n to shelt'ring caves  To pathless cliffs our populace dismay'd  Is now ascending to insult the fane  With sacrilegious violence to seize  Th' accumulated off'rings by the great  And good from age to age devoted there  He scarce had finish'd when the earth beneath  Rock'd from her center in convulsive throes  From pole to pole th' ethereal concave groan'd  Night from her cavern with gigantic steps  Bestrode the region lifting high as heav'n  Her broad infernal palm whose umbrage hides  The throne of light while glancing through the rifts  Of her black mande overlaid with clouds  Blue vapours trail'd their fires The double head  Of tall Parnassus reeling from the crag  Unloos'd two fragments mountainous in bulk  They roll to Delphi with a crashing sound  Like thunder nigh whose burst of ruin strikes  The shatter'd ear with horror Thus the bard  Unmov'd while round him ev'ry face is pale  Not on our heads these menaces are thrown  By ireful nature and portentous heav'n  Th' unrighteous now th' oppressor of mankind  The sacrilegious in this awful hour  Alone should feel dismay My Delphian host  Who knows but thund'ring Jove's prophetic son  Now vindicates his altar in his name  Now calls the turbid elements to war  What shrieks of terror fill thy native streets  The hills with barb'rous dissonance of cries  The caverns howl Athenians be prepar'd  Best so when arm'd then Timon case thy limbs  The season teems with prodigy Secure  In conscious virtue let us calmly watch  The mighty birth By heav'n through yonder gate  The foes are driven confusion wild despair  With panic dread pursue them friends embrace  Th' auspicious moment lift your pious blades  Ye chosen men auxiliars to a god  He spake advancing with his holy friend  To battle Shiv'ring at their own misdeed  At heav'ninflicted punishment the foes  Unnerv'd distracted unresisting deem'd  The warriors two celestials from above  Cas'd in Vulcanian panoply to wage  The war of gods The whole Athenian train  In equal fervour with Barbarian blood  Distain their weapons So from forests drear  When barren winter binds the foodful earth  Enrag'd by famine trooping wolves invade  A helpless village unwithstood they range  With greedy fangs and dye with human gore  The snowenvelop'd ways The Delphian race  By fear so lately to the neighb'ring hills  And caves restrain'd forsake their shelt'ring holds  In clusters rushing on the foes dismay'd  Accomplish their defeat Th' Athenian chief  Triumphant red with massacre admits  A Persian youth to mercy who his shield  And sword surrenders Persian dost thou hope  Thy flow'ring bloom shall ripen to enjoy  A length of days severe his victor spake  Then to my questions utter words sincere  Reveal thy name thy father's Where encamps  The host of Xerxes Whither doth he point  His inroad next To violate this fane  By his appointment was thy youth compell'd  Last if thou know'st what impious savage tore  The Delphian maiden from Minerva's shrine  The Persian answers with a crimson'd cheek  With eyes in tearsAh little now avails  Th' illustrious current of Argestes' blood  To me a captive less the name I bear  Of Artamanes By the king's decree  That we were sent that I unwilling came  Is truth sincere Our leader slain the heaps  Of these disfigur'd carcases have made  Their last atonement to th' insulted god  The king in rich Orchomenus I left  Who through Boeotia meditates to march  Against th' Athenians He alas who seiz'd  The beauteous virgin at Minerva's shrine  He is my brother eldest of the race  Far hence secure while captive here I mourn  His heinous outrage and my own disgrace  Addressing Timon here Cecropia's bard  Preserve this youth a hostage for thy child  He seems deserving thee I know humane  Now to Apollo's temple be my guide  Still dost thou droopO Aeschylus exclaims  Desponding Timon from the woes begun  This day in Delphi I to Athens trace  A series black with evil Lo the wise  The righteous Aristides from your walls  Through jealousy of merit is expell'd  Themistocles the cause Himself though great  Yet envious and ambitious that his light  May blaze unrivall'd of th' Athenian state  Extinguishes the brightest Sparta shews  At this dread crisis how the hearts of men  By selfish eares and falsehood are deprav'd  She to the land of Pelops still confines  Her efforts on the neighb'ring isthmus rears  A partial bulwark leaving half the Greeks  Your noble seat this oracle expos'd  To devastation little she regards  Our god profan'd our progeny enslav'd  Her chief Pausanias arrogant and stern  O'erlooks my suff'rings Feeling what I fear  For thee and others I must droop my friend  To him the bard in these sententious strains  Not endless sunshine is the lot of man  Nor ever blooming seasons Night succeeds  The day as day the night rude winter frowns  Fair summer smiles Thus variable the mind  Not less than human fortune feels the strife  Of truth and error which alternate reign  The arbiters of nature Dark the deed  A deed of gloomy night when envy forc'd  The best Athenian from his natal roof  But light will soon return Though Sparta break  Her promise pledg'd though false Boeotia prop  A foreign throne still Athens will sustain  Herself and Greece will retribution pay  To Aristides and her morn dispel  The mist of error with a glorious blaze  No moremy duty calls me to the fane  They move and passing by Minerva's grove  Two monuments of terror see There stopp'd  The massy fragments from Parnassus rent  An act of nature by some latent cause  Disturb'd Tremendous o'er Barbarian ranks  The ruins down the sacred way had roll'd  Leaving its surface horrible to sight  Such as might startle war's remorseless god  And shake his heart of adamant Not long  This bloodcongealing spectacle detains  The troop which swiftly to the Pythian dome  Press their ascending steps The martial bard  First as enjoin'd by holy form to scenes  Far diff'rent sweet Castalia's fount and grove  Resorts with pure ablution to redeem  From dust and slaughter his polluted limbs  To holy eyes obscene Beside the fane  Within a flow'ring bosom of the hill  Through veins of rock beneath embow'ring shade  The rills divine replenish as they flow  A cavity of marble O'er the brim  In slender sheets of liquid crystal down  They fall harmonious Plistus takes below  To his smooth bed their tribute Plunging there  In deep obscurity of wood whose roof  With ridgy verdure meets the lowbent eye  From that stupendous cliff his current winds  Through shade awhile thence issuing large in view  Refreshes grateful meads by mountains edg'd  Which terminate on Cirrha Delphian port  Beyond her walls blue Neptune spreads his face  Far as Achaia's wide expanse of coast  With tow'rs and cities crown'd The marble fount  On either side is skirted thick by groves  Of ancient laurel with luxuriant arms  In glossy green attir'd There Phoebus pride  Of Parian quarries stands a form divine  In act to draw an arrow from the case  Loose hanging o'er his shoulder and in look  Serene but stern his worshippers to guard  As if the Pythian serpent were in sight  He meditates the combat Here disarm'd  His limbs from all th' impurities of Mars  Th' Athenian purges Menial care supplies  A garment silverwhite an olive branch  His suppliant hand sustains He seeks the fane  He mounts the steps magnificent the gates  On sounding hinges turn their brazen valves  Across an area vast with solemn shade  Of massy columns border'd slow he moves  His manly frame Procumbent at the mouth  Of that abyss oracular whose fume  Breathes wild sensation through the Pythian maid  With hands outstretch'd he offers up this pray'r  O vanquisher of Python Seed of Jove  Whose eleutherian might the tyrant dreads  Bright pow'r of day dispenser of that fire  Which kindles genius in the human breast  God of that light diffusing through the soul  The rays of truth and knowledge Friend to man  His monitor prophetic O admit  Athenians anxious for their country's weal  In this her day of peril to consult  Thy wisdom thy protection to implore  Her tripod high the prophetess ascends  Enthusiastic motion strains her form  In flashes rolls her eyeballs and bespreads  Her agitated front with floating hair  Her weight a laurel planted nigh upholds  Which she embraces her convulsive grasp  Shakes to the root the groaning trunk the boughs  The clatt'ring foliage Forth she bursts in foam  Fly wretched men to earth's extremest bound  I see I see th' Acropolis in flames  Your temples crumble and your turrets nod  I see the blood run sable through your streets  All unabash'd the hero firm replies  Yet further speak Though citadel and fanes  Be doom'd to ashes must the nation fall  If so instruct thy suppliants how their fall  May prove most glorious in the sight of gods  And menThe Pythian answers with a look  Of pity soft'ning her tempestuous rage  Ah still my tongue like adamant is hard  Minerva's tow'rs must perish Jove severe  So wills yet granting at his daughter's suit  Her people refuge under walls of wood  But shun the myriads of terrific horse  Which on your fields an eastern Mars will range  She ceas'd Th' Athenian notes her answer down  To one the most entrusted of his train  He gives the tablet Back to Athens fly  He said the son of Neocles alone  By his unbounded faculties can pierce  The hidden sense of these mysterious strains  All which of Xerxes thou hast heard report  I must depart to ElisMust thou go  Dejected Timon then what safety here  For me remains Barbarians will return  My countrymen dishearten'd as before  Resort to caverns Though the god hath sav'd  His shrine the rest of Phocis lies a prey  Boeotia Locris Doris to the foe  Yet what have I O Aeschylus to dread  I have no other child for savage force  To violate In Amarantha lost  My joy my hope are vanish'd and the hand  Which lays me breathless will befriend me best  Th' Athenian here Unmanly is despair  A noxious weed whose growth my Delphian host  Let courage wither Phoebus hath denounc'd  The waste of Athens Hopeful I forebode  That prouder walls and battlements will lift  Their heads for ages and that eye of Greece  With inextinguishable ray surpass  Its former lustre Quit this dang'rous place  With us embarking borrow help from time  Safe counsellor to wisdom You the race  Of holy Delphi should the foe return  Again dispersing to your caves rely  On your protecting god Not vers'd alone  In holy rites in arms and council tried  A chief like Timon fame forbids to hide  His dignity in cavernsTimon here  Thou shalt conduct me thou my friendly star  Meantime selected messengers I send  The needful barks at Cirrha to prepare  Now from the temple under Timon's roof  Admitted vig'rous with refection due  Of rest and food to Cirrha they proceed  With Artamanes Ready are the barks  The gale propitious calm the wat'ry plain  When like the feather'd sojourners who leave  Their late abode on winter's bleak approach  To wing their flight for climates more benign  These with extended canvas quit the port  And doubling round Achaia cut the main  To sacred Pisa On their way the harp  Of Aeschylus preluding to the strain  Which on his banks Alpheus was to hear  Relieves the sailor toiling at his oar  Enchants the wind retentive of the sounds  Which harmonize his breath If round the keel  Of sweet Arion dolphins ever play'd  Or blithsome Nereids to the pleasing mood  Of Orpheus danc'd while Argo plough'd the deep  They now had felt controulment as in bonds  Not on their pliant azureglossy fins  Disporting light but rigid with amaze  At this majestic muse Yet sounding verse  In solemn cadence to the deepton'd lyre  Which could the boist'rous mariner subdue  The ear of Timon languid by despair  Rejects attentive to his grief alone  Which sighs within Society is pain  Ev'n with his friend A solitary couch  He seeks recumbent not reposing there  Consumes the hours in pertinacious woe  Which sheds no tear If wearied nature sinks  His sleep is troubled visions of the night  Appal his spirit starting he forsakes  A thorny pillow rushes on the deck  With lamentations to the midnight moon  Alarm'd th' Athenian chief approaching seiz'd  On Timon's hand with earnest looks enquir'd  Why thus complaining he disturbs the calm  From his own pillow chacing due repose  Ah I have seen my daughter he replies  Have seen her twiceWhere seen her all distress'd  Th' Athenian questionsOn a rock she stood  A naked rock the parent wild exclaims  Unloos'd her zone dishevell'd was her hair  The ravisher was nigh On sight of me  Who no assistance from the shore could reach  O father father I am sham'd deflower'd  But here will end my sorrows and disgrace  She said and plung'd precipitate I saw  Her body swallow'd by the greedy surge  Unwept depriv'd of sepulture to float  Illusion all the bard consoling spake  The phantom offspring of distemper'd sleep  A second time the frantic fire pursues  Did Amarantha meet my aking sight  Then like an eastern concubine attir'd  Her head was blazon'd with Barbaric gems  With golden gloss her wanton garment wav'd  With her despoiler hand in hand she walk'd  Disclaim'd her father and her father's gods  Oh then I wish'd her on the waves again  To parch in winds or sate some vulture's beak  The youthful captive Artamanes rous'd  Stands nigh in gen'rous tears To him the bard  Ingenuous Persian check thy tears and lend  Thy hand benign committed to his couch  Him watch and fuccourHourly was perform'd  The pious office noblest Delphians round  Assist in tears while now the moonlight twice  Danc'd on the billows On the second morn  They land in Elis Fame had gone before  Promulgating the valour which aveng'd  The Delphian god prophetic light to man  Ev'n more than Jove in Ammon's Libyan shrine  Or Dodonaean groves A shining car  Waits on the shore a herald there salutes  The warrior bard Divine Athenian hail  Hail righteous captain of a righteous band  These olive crowns to thee and them I bear  So have the sage Hellanodics ordain'd  Who to their just tribunal through my voice  Invite thy presence Aeschylus receives  The victor's chaplet and ascends the car  Along Alphēus to th' Olympian lists  He passes through spectators all array'd  In garlands too and num'rous like the flow'rs  Embellishing the river's fragrant sides  Or like the pebbles in his murm'ring bed  Th' approach of Aeschylus is known Between  Two rows of victors in their olive crowns  He o'er the sanded area greets the thrones  Where grac'd with scepters magisterial sat  Th' Elēan judges Standing on the car  To them uprising from their seats he spake  If to have fought for Delphi and her god  Deserve this chaplet what superior praise  To him is due who voluntary died  For Lacedaemon But he claims no more  Than emulation from the sons of Greece  Like him to save their countries and their laws  He hath his honours in the bless'd abodes  From him I come deputed hear in me  Leonidas A vision as of gods  To me late slumb'ring on Ilissus rose  In semblance rose Leonidas begirt  With all the virtuous partners in his fate  Before me earth divided through the cleft  A gushing radiance dimm'd the eye of noon  In structure all of diamond selfpois'd  Amid redundant light a chariot hung  Triumphal Twelve transparent horses breath'd  Beams from their nostrils dancing beams of day  Shook from their manes In lineaments of man  Chang'd to immortal with a shape enlarg'd  A stature lengthen'd there the mighty soul  Of Sparta's king apparent shone His wounds  Shot forth a starlike splendour Round in cars  Triumphal too arrang'd the stately forms  Of those whom virtue led to share his doom  And consecrate Thermopylae to fame  To me these words the glorious shape address'd  Go to the sage Hellanodics the just  Elēan judges of Olympian palms  In that wide concourse celebrate my death  Let my example gen'ral Greece inspire  To face her danger let the Spartan shield  Protect th' Athenians else I died in vain  Attention mute th' Hellanodics command  The thick'ning crowd is hush'd The bard proceeds  While inspiration swells his copious breast  Flames in his eye and thunders from his voice  Parnassian Phoebus he invok'd the pow'r  Of prophecy and song His aid is due  In celebration of the man who heard  The oracle from Delphi and obey'd  "A king deriv'd from Hercules must die  "For Lacedaemon" Who obedient heard  Leonidas he left his household gods  His wife belov'd his offspring at the gate  Of Greece Thermopylae he fought he fell  With him what heroes Alpheus Maron bled  There Agis there Dioneces the seer  Megistias bold Diomedon the youth  Of Dithyrambus Thespia's hoary chief  Demophilus for you they all expir'd  Rise Greeks revenge their fall in that revenge  Your laws your manners and religion save  You who aspire to these Olympic wreaths  The brightest guerdon to a Grecian brow  Yet will you linger till Barbaric arms  Annihilate th' Olympiad Not to die  Leonidas invites no Greeks to live  Surmounting foes enervate by the dread  His death impress'd to fill your cup of life  With virtuous glory to enjoy your hopes  In peace in years and merit then mature  Be his companions in eternal bliss  Such was the substance but in swelling phrase  At large full tide of poesy and zeal  Flow'd his highton'd enthusiastic song  End of the First Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the SECOND  TH' inspiring measures close To arms to arms  Innumerable mouths concurrent sound  To arms to arms reply the pillar'd isles  Of Jove's Olympian temple down his banks  To distant Neptune glad Alphēus wafts  The glorious clamour Through th' assembly vast  Meantime an elevated form is seen  With gracious gesture animating look  Approaching now before th' Elean thrones  Of solemn judgment he majestic stands  Known for the man by Themis plac'd in rank  Above his fellow mortals archon once  Of Athens now an exile him the chief  Among the grave Hellanodics address'd  Hail Aristides On th' Olympian games  Thy presence throws new dignity what crown  Can they provide to equal thy desert  While others court the prize of strength and skill  Activity and valour in the lists  Of virtue only Aristides strives  With him on earth competitor is none  Him Jove sole perfect judge of gods and men  Can recompense alone He scornful views  Ambitious heroes who assume the names  Of thunderbearers vanquishers of towns  And ravagers of kingdoms vain attempt  In feeble man to imitate in pow'r  Th' inimitable gods On thee he casts  An eye delighted thee by ev'ry tongue  Proclaim'd the just thee emulating heav'n  Where mortals may in goodness Yet our voice  Shall what we can decree dispraise to those  Whose envy wrong'd that sacred head of thine  Forbear that censure Aristides spake  Though liberty may err through jealous care  That jealous care far oft'ner saves a state  Than injures private worth That I forgave  My condemnation be my witness Jove  Whom I departing from my native soil  Implor'd that Athens ne'er might feel the loss  Of Aristides To confirm that pray'r  I have employ'd my exile not in quest  Of splendid refuge in the courts of kings  But through each city with unwearied steps  Have pass'd exhorting stimulating Greece  To bold defence I gladly am forestall'd  Here by a noble countryman whose arm  At Marathon was fam'd whose Attic lays  Immortalize the brave I now invoke  Not with less fervour though in humbler phrase  The patriots there triumphant e'en in death  The manes of Leonidas of all  Whose gen'rous blood newspilt in freedom's cause  Thermopylae beholds to spread abroad  Their glorious spirit and exalt your minds  Above the sense of danger Now the weal  Of gen'ral Greece a gen'ral effort claims  March to the plain ye Doric warriors mount  Your decks th' Athenians with united arms  Support no longer in that isthmian fence  Your trust reposing Were the wall of brass  Were adamant the rampart if the pow'r  Of Athens once extinguish'd leave your coasts  Defenceless soon to Pelops' Isle the foe  Like death a thousand avenues will find  He ceas'd A second acclamation rends  The sky again th' Olympian temple groans  In replication and Alphēan banks  Reverberate the sound The Attic bard  Meantime o'erspent with labour of the mind  And voice loud straining to the tranquil porch  Of Jove is lightly borne nor knows the hands  Benevolent and pious which sustain  His languid burden till these friendly words  In tones remember'd dissipate his trance  Doth Aeschylus forget me O recal  Melissa's brother and Oïleus' son  Whose Locrian hinds at one auspicious hour  Assisted thy bold mariners to hurl  Th' Oetaean ruins on Barbarian heads  See Meliboeus off'ring to thy lip  The stream's refreshing moistureSoon restor'd  Th' Athenian thus Illustrious Medon hail  How fares Melissa how thy native land  She rests I hope on Oeta still secure  Returns the Locrian When Laconia's king  Was slain and I commanded to retreat  Charg'd with a solemn notice to her state  That he expir'd obedient to the laws  My life devoted to avenge his blood  I sav'd O'erpow'ring Xerxes soon reduc'd  The Locrians Dorians ev'ry northern Greek  In time my father's treasure I remov'd  Which with a hundred followers I bore  To Lacedaemon There indiff'rence cold  I found to all except of Pelops' Isle  Attention sole to build an isthmian wall  Pausanias guardian to the minor king  Son of divine Leonidas disdains  Our just complaint The Ephori confine  To this contracted region all their care  Save Aëmnestus Gen'rous oft he mourn'd  In vain his torpid colleagues he reprov'd  Disgusted there I join'd these solemn games  Where in contention of the warlike spear  I prov'd a victor Olivebound my head  On future fields its freedom shall maintain  Else with my late preserver's fate in view  Shall dying roll this chaplet in the dust  Repair with me to Athens cries the bard  Sage is that counsel Aristides near  Subjoins time presses Aeschylus embark  Aegina's hospitable round supplies  My place of restNow swift th' Athenian band  With Medon's seek their Delphian barks again  While Aristides holds an inland course  Still to his country meditating good  Of his own wrongs forgetful As he roam'd  From state to state his eloquence instill'd  The love of freedom horror at her loss  Unchanging hatred to monarchal sway  With concord valour fortitude and zeal  For Greece in danger From his wonted seat  In heav'n so Phoebus patient and resign'd  An exile wander'd on the earth below  Beneficent and helpful there diffus'd  His light of science with salubrious skill  Imparted health and taught the varied use  Of lenient roots and plants The Delphian keels  Meantime are loosen'd from Elēan sands  With sails outstretch'd for Athens On his couch  Still Timon lies despairing near him watch  The chiefs humane in kind officious care  The Persian captive from his forehead wipes  The dews of anguish With a sudden start  Him now the Delphian erring thus bespoke  Oh Alexander thou hast lost my son  Thy dear betroth'd the land of Phocis lost  Her noblest virgin Reach my armsI see  The ravisher before me though he frowns  Begirt with savage multitudes my sword  Shall reach his barb'rous heart Here Medon turns  To Aeschylus The sight of Delphi's chief  So nobly excellent so honour'd lov'd  By all resorting to consult his god  A sight once grateful pierces now my soul  With agony How oft hath music sooth'd  Distemper'd bosoms Let thy tuneful chords  Medicinally sweet apply their aid  To him the bard My harmony his ear  But late rejected Meliboeus try  The softer sounds which Pan hath taught the swains  A modulation by Melissa taught  I will essay th' obedient swain replies  He said and lightly touch'd his warbling flute  Like fountains rilling or mellifluous notes  Of birds a soft and lulling flow attun'd  The ambient air At first th' afflicted man  Paus'd in attention soon a trickling tear  Bedew'd his beard the remedy was chang'd  To pain and thus he recommenc'd his moan  Thou Amarantha too couldst wake the soul  Of music melting in thy parent's ear  Refining joyful seasons or the hours  Of care beguiling In a foreign clime  Hang up thy harp sad captive Let thy hand  Forget her skill nor charm Barbarian minds  But hark I hear the ruffian Slave he calls  Resume thy harp Some chosen hymn of Greece  Such as delighted Phoebus chaunt to me  Me now thy god O Alexander fly  Redeem thy love Apollo who couldst hurl  Parnassian summits on a host of foes  Make me thy instrument of wrath My nerves  Convert to pierceless adamant my lance  Point with thy father's lightning Me thy priest  Sprung from an old heroic sacred line  Thou shouldst avenge But vengeance is too late  My daughter yields a minstrel to her lord  To her deflow'rer with obsequious art  The Grecian chords she prostitutes and smiles  To see my suff'ringsDuring this distress  With canvas press'd the squadron bounds along  By Coryphasium by Messene's gulph  In Nestor's Pylian kingdom by the peak  Of Taenarus projecting o'er a cave  Night's gloomy chamber fabled to descend  Low as Plutonian regions Thrice the morn  Serenely smil'd ere Malea's top their sails  O'ershades Laconian promontory bleak  The residence of storms Five distant masts  Are now descried when Aeschylus bespake  The Locrian chief Not friendly are those decks  Our navy since Thermopylae was forc'd  To Salamis retiring leaves the foes  At large to range the sea Thy counsel give  To some Laconian harbour shall we steer  Or wait their coming Here Oïleus' son  Thou art my leader thee propitious Mars  On land and main with equal pow'rs endues  How can I counsel stranger to the waves  At thy commandment to retreat or fight  Behold me readyThen by Mars replies  The warrior bard as no resistless force  Bears down against us yet insulting hoists  A threat'ning signal Delphians rest the oar  Provide your arms Athenians Locrians arm  This said his pinnace launch'd in haste convey'd  His orders round to form th' embattled line  Six were the vessels Lo a stately bark  In regal pendants leads th' opponent van  As when a vernal sun's precarious beam  Is intercepted by a sudden cloud  Whose turgid folds are overcharg'd with hail  Some palace broad impenetrably roof'd  Defies the clatt'ring ineffectual drift  Which harmless melts awayso flew a show'r  Of missive arms of arrows javelins darts  With pebbles whirling from the forceful sling  On Grecian helms and implicated shields  But innocently fell Now side to side  The chieftains grappled and gigantic death  To either deck outstretch'd his purple feet  Malignant art no engine hath devis'd  To man destructive like his own fell hand  In serried fight But slaughter now began  To pause in wonder while the Asian chief  Whose blazon'd armour beam'd with gold engag'd  Cecropia's hardy vet'ran foot to foot  With falchion falchion shield encount'ring shield  So in the season when lascivious heat  Burns in their veins two branchingheaded stags  Of all the herd competitors for sway  Long with entangled horns persist in strife  Nor yield nor vanquish stand in gaze the rest  Expecting which by conquest shall assume  The mastery of all Now Timon rous'd  With Meliboeus and the captive youth  Starts from his pillow they attain the poop  Which instant boarded from an eastern ship  By hostile arms is held Brave Medon quits  His former station Aeschylus he leaves  A firm defender there his falchion keen  Aloft he waves As some tremendous shark  Who with voracious jaws resistless foams  Along the main and finny tribes devours  Or drives before him on the sunbright waves  Where late secure they wanton'dMedon's might  Prevailing thus the steerage heaps with dead  Though not in time victorious to retain  Unhappy Timon Meliboeus good  And Artamanes not unwilling borne  With them away to join his friends again  Two Delphian vessels their auxiliar beaks  Present More furious had the contest glow'd  In ev'ry quarter when o'er Malean cliffs  The wind began to howl the troubled sky  To flash sulphureous menacing a storm  Such as Saturnia on the Dardan fleet  Or Neptune's rage for Polyphemus blind  Dash'd on Laërtes' much enduring son  The squadrons separate To the shelt'ring lee  Of Malea steer the Grecians while their foes  Expatiate o'er the roomy sea to shun  The local tumults of that stormy shore  And hold a distant course O'er Timon's fate  Th' Athenian now finds leisure to lament  With Medon Medon with responsive grief  For Meliboeus By return of dawn  The waters calm'd invite the vigorous oars  To recommence their progress Coasting down  Laconia's seabeat verge they wear the day  Then resting moor in Cynosura's port  From Aeschylus in sighs these accents broke  Here Aesculapius by his pow'rful art  Which dar'd revive departed breath in man  Offending Pluto thunderpierc'd by Jove  Lodg'd his own clay in Cynosura's mold  O now to immortality preferr'd  Kind god of med'cine wouldst thou hear my suit  Thou shouldst restore Leonidas to warm  Unfeeling Sparta then thy Delphian sire  The menac'd doom of Athens would revoke  Nor I besprinkle with indignant tears  Laconia's shore O Locrian guest I call'd  Thy welcome feet to Athens thou mayst view  For so the oracle to me denounc'd  Her tow'rs in dustMinerva's tow'rs to fall  Hath Phoebus doom'd the Locrian chief exclaim'd  I who have lost my country yet can find  A tear for Athens I attest the gods  As in one vessel Aeschylus we steer  Together now thy fortune I will share  And down her stream howe'er the tempest roar  With thee embark'd will never quit thy side  The tragic bard unbends his mournful brow  Thus answ'ring Gen'rous Medon I confess  Approaching nearer to my seat of birth  I dropp'd a tear of anguish nature wept  At sad forebodings of destruction there  But know a true Athenian ne'er desponds  Abandon'd by allies condemn'd by heav'n  To see their city burnt that gallant race  Will yet assert their liberty will save  Ev'n faithless Sparta and thy home redeem  This said they slept till morning gives her sign  To weigh the anchors and unfurl the sails  Aurora's third appearance

artificial beds of pearly conchs  Along the seabeat margin cull'd by nymphs  The temple's chaste attendants Unrestrain'd  Here flow'd the native waters there confin'd  By marble fountains win th'

lovely in her shape  As virgin Thetis to the nuptial arms  Of Peleus led more blooming than the flow'rs  Beneath her decent step descends the slope  A matron staid behind her solemn treads  Close to

exterminated friends console  Cleander finish'd Soon th' arrival known  Of Aristides from the temple call'd  The Attic dames from ev'ry purlieu near  Who with their children in assembly throng  Around him Silent tears confess his loss  To them and Athens His benignant mold  By sympathy had melted into grief  If wisdom ever present in his soul  Had not his longtried constancy upheld  To their behoof Environ'd by the troop  Of lovely mourners stood the godlike man  Like some tall cedar in a garden plac'd  Where glowing tufts of flow'rs and florid plants  Once bloom'd around now sear'd by scorching blasts  In faded colours pine In look in phrase  Humane he spake Be comforted and hear  My voice applaud Themistocles my foe  Whose counsels have preserv'd you But what praise  Is yours O glories of the tender sex  Who brave the floods without a murmur leave  Your native dear abodes for public good  Ye ornaments of Greece the pride and boast  Of happy fathers husbands brothers sons  As yet unseen Euphemia from the rest  Impatient stepp'd his mother At her sight  The best the greatest of mankind inclines  Before the authress of his being low  As some celestial to the rev'rend form  Of Cybele progenitrix of gods  Her aged arms extending she began  Thy moderation aggravates the crime  Of Athens Son remember when thou bad'st  Our household gods farewel thy parting pray'r  That Athens never

Cecropian tribes afflicts But noble dames  In this asylum sojourning a while  Trust your own merits and a guardian god  The sons of Athens on his own domain  He will exalt by conquest soon transport  Her daughters back to liberty and peace  From him that grace continue to deserve  By resignation to his brother Jove  Who loves the patientAs on lands adust  By hot solstitial rays when genial clouds  In season due unbosoming their stores  Of kindly rain new dress the pasture brown  Again the flowrets on the meadows spring  O'er meadows fresh in verdure youthful steeds  Led by the parent females

These words  Now break from Medon Silent have I gaz'd  On Aristides shortly must behold  Themistocles Athenian friend explain  Between such men what cause produc'd their feuds  Their diff'rent merits Aeschylus replied  Rais'd emulation in their younger days  A soldier's part they gallantly achiev'd  In the same rank at Marathon I saw  Admir'd their valour For distinction high  In pow'r and fame Themistocles hath us'd  His num'rous virtues Aristides walk'd  In virtuous paths alone by virtue mov'd  For him his justice hath a title gain'd  Of JUST The son of Neocles inflam'd  By envy stirr'd the people's jealous fear  Against his rival to assert a law  Where by inscription of his name on shells  A citizen so potent that his will  Seems only wanting to subvert the state  Is by concurrence of six thousand hands  Doom'd for ten years to absence from their bounds  Without disgrace or mulct Among the tribes  Themistocles hath since obtain'd a sway  Which might incur the rigour of that law  Yet by the gods his influence supreme  He at this crisis gallantly employs  To save the publicLift thy wond'ring eyes  The whole confederated fleet of Greece  Four hundred gallies bulwark all the

strife with fortune when she frown'd  Whene'er she smil'd her favour to secure  He now to feed his enterprising soul  Successes past enumerating sat  Thus in a glow of thought While others dream'd  Of rest and safety permanent in Greece  I from the day of Marathon presag'd  The war begun not finish'd I in time  Exhorted Athens to construct her fleet  A destin'd refuge for the sail and oar  The shrouds and rudder I her lusty youth  Prepar'd ere yet the Hellespont was bridg'd  I cur'd intestine feuds distracting Greece  When fate remov'd Leonidas from earth  My penetration fathoming the depths  Of ocean like futurity foresaw  Laconia's sloth yet undismay'd I form'd  The mighty plan to save th' Athenian state  By yielding Athens to Barbarian flames  That I might plead the mandates of

Thy eloquence and arms the gen'rous toils  Of Aristides too have reach'd my ear  By late intelligence Thus far at least  You have prevail'd this navy is enlarg'd  By squadrons new from various Grecian

diff'rent squadrons to their native ports  Had else deserted Irksome I confess  This acquiescence but occasion looks  Disdainful back on him who lets her pass  You have embrac'd her Yielding to the Greeks  You fix their station here the num'rous foe  In narrow streights between Psyttalia's isle  And Salamis to face Can he possess  Who sees a treasure scatter'd on the ground  Unless he stoop So prostrate in your sight  Lies Greece that precious treasure Can you rule  Before you save On union safety grows  Resigning now an empty name of pow'r  Your moderation winning grateful states  Will to your own a real sway procure  Of long duration Lacedaemon's pride  Her best allies abandoninga force  Of ten weak vessels sparing to a fleet  Where Attic hands unfurl two hundred sails  Shall pay

gladness welcome to my deck  But who is he disconsolate in mien  O rev'rend man of sorrows lift thy head  From Artemisia no dishonour fear  He makes no answerArtamanes speak  The youth replies His name is Timon chief  And priest in Delphi on our inroad there  My brother Mithridates snatch'd away  From his paternal breast a noble maid  An only child His mind is darken'd since  By frenzy my compassion his distress  Hath ever tended fervent now implores  Thou wouldst commit him to my grateful care  Myself am debtor to indulgent Greeks  In smiles the princess answer'd Gen'rous youth  Couldst thou protect him I would trust thy care  But those deform'd by ignominious deeds  May exercise in malice stronger pow'r  Than thou in goodness for the present lay  Th' unhappy Delphian on a

Full thirty annual suns have since elaps'd  He oft appris'd me that my infant lips  In Grecian accents would repeat the names  Of Lygdamis and Dirce so I styl'd  My sire and motherO imperial dame

Affords a passage new to whelming floods  Whose surface hides fertility in waste  Till some sagacious architect oppose  To nature's violence a skill divine  Prescribing where th' obedient wave shall

 Shap'd as pomegranates rose their steely points  Above the truncheons gilded were the shields  Of silver'd scales the corselets wrought with gems  Of price highplum'd tiaras danc'd in light  In equal number in resembling guise  A squadron follow'd save their mail was gold  And thick with beryls edg'd their silver shields  In order next the Magi solemn trod  Preeminent was Mirzes snowy white  Their

Masistius paragon of Asia's peers  In beauteous figure second to the king  Among the brave preeminent more good  Than brave or beauteous to Mardonius dear  His counsellor and friend in Xerxes' court  Left by that gen'ral while in Thrace remote  To counterpoise Argestes Tried in arms  In manners soft though fearless on the plain  Of tend'rest feelings Mindarus to love  A destin'd captive near Masistius rank'd  Ariobarzanes next whose barb'rous mien  Exemplified his fierceness Last of horse  With Midias pow'rful satrap at their head  A chosen myriad clos'd the long array  From these were kept three hundred paces void  Promiscuous nations held their distant march  Beyond that limit numberless they roll'd  In tumult like the fluctuating sands  Disturb'd and buoyant on the whirling breath  Of hurricanes which rend the Libyan wastes  To Thebes descending soon Mardonius learn'd  That pioneers with multitudes lightarm'd  Detach'd before the army bent their course  To Athens On he speeds rejecting food  Disdaining rest till midnight Cynthia shews  A vaulted hollow in a mountain's side  There in his clanging arms Mardonius throws  His limbs for slight refreshment by him lies  Argestes' son to pasture springing nigh  The troop dismiss'd their steeds and slept around  To superstition prone from early age  Was Gobryas' son o'erheated now by toil  Yet more by thirst unsated of renown  His soul partakes not with her wearied clay  In sleep repose the cavern to her view  Appears in vast dimension to enlarge  The sides retire th' ascending roof expands  All chang'd to crystal where pellucid walls  Expose to sight the universe around  Thus did a dream invade the mighty breast  Of that long matchless conqueror who gave  Italia's clime a spoil to Punic Mars  When on the margin of Iberus lay  The slumb'ring chief and eagerly to birth  The vast conception of his pregnant mind  Was struggling Now Mardonius to himself  Seems roving o'er the metamorphos'd cave  Orbicular above an op'ning broad  Admits a flood of light and gentlest breath  Of odorif'rous winds amid the blaze  Full on the center of a pavement spread  Beyond whate'er portentous Aegypt saw  In Thebes or Memphis Fame presiding there  Gigantic shape an amethyst entire  Sits on a throne of adamant On strength  Of pillars each a topaz leans the dome  The silver pavement's intervening space  Between the circling colonnade and wall  With pedestals of diamond is fill'd  The crystal circuit is comparted all  In niches verg'd with rubies From that scene  The gloom of night for ever to expel  Imagination's wanton skill in chains  Of pearl throughout the visionary hall  Suspends carbuncles gems of native light  Emitting splendour such as tales portray  Where Fancy winning sorceress deludes  Th' enchanted mind rejecting reason's clue  To wander wild through fiction's pleasing maze  The oriental hero in his dream  Feels wonder waking at his presence life  Pervades the statue Fame slowrising sounds  Her trumpet loud a hundred golden gates  Spontaneous fly abroad the shapes divine  In ev'ry age in ev'ry climate sprung  Of all the worthies since recorded time  Ascend the lucid hall Again she sounds  A measure sweeter than the Dorian flute  Of Pan or lyre of Phoebus each assumes  His place allotted there transform'd is fix'd  An adamantine statue yet unfill'd  One niche remains To Asia's gazing chief  The goddess then That vacancy for thee  Illustrious son of Gobryas I reserve  He thus exults Bright being dost thou grant  To Persia triumphs through my conqu'ring spear  He said that moment through the sever'd earth  She sinks the spacious fabric is dissolv'd  When he upstarting in the narrow cave  Delivers quiek these accents Be renown  My lot O Fortune unconcern'd I leave  The rest to thee Thus dauntless ere his sleep  Was quite dispers'd but waken'd soon he feels  Th' imperfect vision heavy on his mind  In dubious gloom then lightly with his foot  Moves Artamanes up he springs the troop  Prepare the steeds all mount Aurora dawns  The swift forerunners of th' imperial camp  Ere long Mardonius joins where Athenslifts  Her tow'rs in prospect Unexpected seen  Their mighty chief with gen'ral cordial shouts  They greet their multitude their transport clear  His heart from trouble Soon Barbarian throngs  With shading standards through Cephissus wade  Who had his fam'd divinity been true  His shallow stream in torrents would have swoln  A while to save the capital of Greece  Superb in structure longdisputed prize  Between Minerva and the god of seas  Of eloquence the parent source of arts  Fair seat of freedom Open are the gases  The dwellings mute all desolate the streets  Save that domestic animals forlorn  In cries awak'ning pity seem to call  Their masters home while shrieking beaks of prey  Or birds obscene of night with heavy wings  The melancholy solitude affright  Is this the city whose presumption dar'd  Invade the lord of Asia sternly said  Mardonius ent'ring whither now are fled  Th' audacious train whose firebrands Sardis felt  Where'er you lurk Athenians if in sight  Soon shall you view your citadel in flames  Or if retreated to a distant land  No distant land of refuge shall you find  Against avenging Xerxes yet I swear  By Horomazes if thy gallant race  Have sacrific'd their country to contend  With mightier efforts on a future day  Them I will honour though by honour forc'd  I must destroy Companions now advance  Unnumber'd hands to overturn these walls  Employ not Xerxes through a common gate  Shall enter Athens lay the ruins smooth  That this offending city may admit  In all his state her master with his host  In full array His order is obey'd  Through smooth Ismenus and Asopus clear  The royal host in slow procession led  Their first encampment on a district lodge  Plataea's neighbour that renown'd abode  Of noblest Greeks was desert In his tent  The king by night requested audience grants  To Leontiades that colleague base  Of Anaxander traitor like himself  To Sparta's hero Xerxes thus he warns  Now be the king reminded of the rage  Against his father which Plataea bore  At Marathon that recently she brav'd  Himself in Oeta's pass nor Thespia fought  With less distinguish'd rancour be inform'd  The first is near the other not remote  Thy vengeance both deserve Destroy their fields  Consume their dwellings thy o'erflowing camp  May spare a large detachment I will go  Their willing guide Masistius present spake  O monarch live for ever in the hearts  Of conquer'd nations as of subjects born  Associate clemency with pow'r and all  Must yield obedience thou art master here  Treat thy new vassals kindlyIn a frown  Argestes Shall the king with kindness treat  Invet'rate foes and zealous friends alike  Shall undeserving Thespians shall the race  Of fell Plataea unprovok'd who stain'd  On Attic fields her spear with Persian blood  To help detested Athens shall they share  The clemency of Xerxes in despite  Of this our Theban host who faithful gives  Such wholesome counsel Sov'reign when I brought  Thy condescension late to Sparta's king  Among the grim assembly in his tent  Diomedon Demophilus I saw  With Dithyrambus men preferring death  To amity with thee commanders all  Of these malignant citiesXerxes here  Approving Leontiades thy words  I hear Masistius thee my servant loves  Mardonius always victor in my name  Yet learn at last O satrap who dost wear  The fullest honours to partake with me  What I inherit from Darius hate  Inflexible inexpiable hate  To Athens hate to her confed'rates all  Go Theban chuse what nations of our host  Thou dost prefer thyself appoint their chief  I chuse the Caspians Sacians name for chief  Brave Mithridates great Argestes' heir  Rejoins the traitor These ferocious most  He best approv'd and Mithridates chose  Among the youth most vigorous and fell  In acts of blood To hear Mardonius prais'd  Argestes dreading his return conceiv'd  A pain yet temper'd by a secret joy  He felt arise who rival of his son  Long wish'd him distant from the guarded roof  Where Timon's daughter was confin'd Dismiss'd  To rest all separate They renew their march  By dayspring Leontiades to wreak  On hapless Thespia and Plataea's walls  The hate implacable of Thebes the king  With equal rage to spoil Minerva's reign  Her olive groves now Attica disclos'd  The fields where Ceres first her gifts bestow'd  The rocks whose marble crevices the bees  With sweetness stor'd unparallel'd in art  Rose structures growing on the stranger's eye  Where'er it roam'd delighted On like Death  From his pale courser scatt'ring waste around  The regal homicide of nations pass'd  Unchaining all the furies of revenge  On this devoted country Near the banks  Of desolate Cephissus halting sat  The king retarding night's affrighted steeds  The conflagration wide of crumbling tow'rs  Of ruin'd temples of the crackling groves  Of villages and towns he thence enjoy'd  Thence on the manes of Darius call'd  Son of Hystaspes if the dead can hear  Thou didst command thy servants to remind  Thy anger daily of th' Athenian race  Who insolently plough'd the eastern waves  Thy shores affronted with their hostile beaks  And burnt thy town of Sardis at my call  Ghost of my father lift thy awful brow  Rememb'ring now th' Athenians see thy son  On their presumptuous heads retaliate flames  Depriv'd of burial shall their bodies leave  Pale spectres here to wail their city fall'n  And wander through its ruinsClosing here  His barb'rous lips the tyrant sought his couch  Thy summits now Pentelicus and thine  Haunt of sonorous bees Hymettus sweet  Are ting'd with orient light The Persian host  Renew their progress Athens soon receives  Their floating banners and extended ranks  Smooth o'er the fosse by mural ruins fill'd  As from a course of ravage in her den  Of high Cithaeron plung'd the monster Sphinx  Her multifarious form preparing still  For havoc new her fangs and talons dire  Till her enigma Laius' son resolv'd  Whence desperation cast her headlong down  The rocky steep so after thy career  Of devastation Xerxes rest awhile  Secure in Athens meditating there  Fresh woes to men Than Oedipus more wise  Th' interpreter of oracles is nigh  Soon will the son of Neocles expel  Thee from thy hold by policy too deep  For thy barbarian council to explore  Before the Prytanaeum stops the car  Now savage bands inclose that rev'rend seat  Of judgment there Mardonius waits The king  Pleas'd with his care salutes him Thou hast long  Sweat under harness in th' eternal snows  Of Macedon and Thracia hast my name  There dress'd in ample trophies but thy speed  Preventing my arrival is unknown  To wings of eagles or the feet of stags  Mardonius answers Ever live the king  To find his servants zeal outstrip in speed  The swiftest eagle or the fleetest stag  Descend thou lord of Athens destin'd soon  To universal swayThey climb the steps  Alone Argestes follows In the hall  These words of high import Mardonius spake  My liege the season calls for quick

Collect ten thousand warriors on the strand  Which faces Salamis an island near  Psyttalia nam'd possess ere long the foes  Against her craggy border may be driven  Let spoils and captives signalize thy zeal  Thou Artamanes must attend him there  Nor let me want intelligence Farewel  This mandate giv'n the active chief proceeds  With steps impatient to Phaleron's port  End of the Fourth Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the FIFTH  THE sun was set Autarctus and his band  In haste collected through nocturnal shades  To small Psyttalia pass'd a narrow frith  As on a desert forest where at night  A branching oak some traveller hath climb'd  To couch securely if the trunk beset  By famish'd wolves in herd who thirst for blood  Pale morn discovers to his waking sight  His hair in terrour bristles pants his breast  In doubt of safety thus Aurora shew'd  The unexpected gleam of Persian arms  Which fill'd Psyttalia while the Attic strand  With numbers equal to its sandy stores  Was cover'd and Phaleron's road with masts  A floating forest crowded like the pines  Majestic daughters of the Pontic woods  Fair Athens burn'd in sight embodied smoke  Rose mountainous emitting pillar'd flames  Whose umber'd light the newlydawning sun  But half eclips'd At intervals are heard  The hollow sound of columns prostrate laid  The crash of levell'd walls of sinking roofs  In massy ruin Consternation cold  Benumbs the Greek spectators all aghast  Except th' Athenians whose unshaken minds  To this expected fate resign'd their homes  For independence Gigantean rang'd  From ship to ship Despair she drives ashore  The timid leaders changing late resolves  For gen'rous combat into base retreat  To seek the shelter of their native ports  They clamour loud the admiral convenes  A council him Themistocles address'd  Now Eurybiades to whose command  I voluntary yielded from thy charge  Not less for Athens than for gen'ral Greece  I claim a righteous and heroic part  The promis'd fight in these auspicious streights  Which rend'ring vain the multitude of foes  Assure success But separate this fleet  A hundred openings may Barbarians chuse  To Pelops' region not on ev'ry spot  An isthmian wall is plac'd Depriv'd of all  If to your succour we Athenians lose  All claim ye Greeks be valiant for yourselves  See Attica in flames the temples raz'd  The tombs defac'd the venerable dust  Of our forefathers soatter'd in the wind  Would you avoid calamities like these  To sound instruction lean th' almighty gods  Wise counsels bless with prosperous events  To its own folly wilful blindness leave  Proud Adimantus on his birth elate  The admiral of Corinth envying long  Cecropia's name and pow'r arose and spake  For public safety when in council meet  Men who have countries silence best becomes  Him who hath none shall such presume to vote  Too patient Spartan nay to dictate here  Who cannot tell us they possess a home  For Attica in flames her temples raz'd  Her tombs disfigur'd for th' ignoble dust  Of thy forefathers scatter'd in the wind  Thou lowborn son of Neocles must Greece  Her welfare hazard on a single day  Which unsuccessful endless ruin brings  Cleander heard Troezene's youthful chief  Warm was his bosom eloquent his tongue  Strongnerv'd his limbs well exercis'd in arms  Preventing thus Themistocles he spake  Though blood Corinthian be of noblest dye  Baseborn the soul when folly is her sire  Absurdity and malice no reply  Deserve from thee Athenian thee more wise  More valiant more distinguish'd in thyself  Than all the vaunted progeny of gods  Did you not mourn ye deities to see  A nation you created with their soil  Forsake that ancient land or not admire  Your greatest work the conduct of that man  Who such a race from such endearing homes  Wives husbands elders infants maidens youths  In gen'rous quest of liberty could lead  Do you not look indignant down to hear  Such venomous reproaches on his worth  A wrong to Greece Her saviour him I call  As yet I trust his dictates will prevail  While he declaim'd Themistocles who scorn'd  The insolent Corinthian sat and scann'd  The looks of all his penetrating fight  Could read the thoughts of men the major part  He saw averse to battle Sparta's chief  Uncertain cold and slow Affecting here  Decisive looks and scorn of more debate  Thus brief he clos'd Athenians still possess  A city buoyant on two hundred keels  Thou admiral of Sparta frame thy choice  Fight and Athenians shall thy arm sustain  Retreat Athenians shall retreat to shores  Which bid them welcome to Hesperian shores  For them by ancient oracles reserv'd  Safe from insulting foes from false allies  And Eleutherian Jove will bless their flight  So said your own Leonidas who died  For public welfare You that glorious death  May render Spartans fruitless to yourselves  This said he left the council not to fly  But with his wonted policy compel  The Greeks to battle At a secret cove  He held in constant readiness a skiff  In Persian colours mask'd he there embark'd  The most entrusted of his household charg'd  With these instructions Now return my love  Sicinus born a Persian of my house  Not as a slave long habitant but friend  My children's tutor in my trust supreme  To Xerxes' navy sail accost her chief  In words like theseThemistocles who leads  Athenian squadrons is the monarch's friend  Approv'd by this intelligence the Greeks  In consternation shortly will resolve  To separate and fly let Asia's fleet  Her numbers round in diligence extend  Investing ev'ry passage then confus'd  This whole consederated force of Greece  Will sooner yield than fight and Xerxes close  At once so perilous a warHe ceas'd  Meanwhile the council wasted precious hours  Till Eurybiades at length alarm'd  Lest all th' Athenians should retreat incens'd  Postpon'd the issue to th' ensuing day  Themistocles retiring to his tent  There found his wife his stratagem on wings  Of execution left his mind serene  Relax'd in thought he trifled with his boy  Young child who playful on the mother's lap  Soon as of Xerxes earnest she enquir'd  With frowning graces on his brow of down  Clench'd fast his infant hands The dame pursues  O that the Greeks would emulate this child  Clench fast their weapons and confront the foe  Did we abandon our paternal homes  Our nuptial chambers from the cradle snatch  Our helpless babes Did tender maidens join  Unanimous the cry 'Embark embark  'For Salamis and freedom' to behold  The men debating so the Attic wives  Are told uncertain if to fight or serve  Who are the cowards rather traitors say  We will assail them as the Trojan dames  Did Polymestor royal thief who broke  The holiest ties for goldTake comfort love  All shall be well Themistocles replied  Yes I in thee have comfort she proceeds  Thou canst devise some artifice to urge  Ev'n dastards on Sicinus thou hast sent  I ask not whitherIn a smile her lord  With thy permission then the gods remain  My confidents to ease thee I proclaim  This boy the first of Greeks he governs thee  Thou me I Athens who shall govern Greece  As I am sure to circumvent the foes  Retiring seek the town console the dames  Thy husband never was so high in hope  She pleas'd departing spake To govern thee  Requires an art which never woman knew  Nor man most artful thou controllest all  Yet call'st nay often seem'st thyself controll'd  She distant thus he meditates alone  True when I seem controll'd by others most  Then most assur'd my enterprize succeeds  O lib'ral nature science arts acquir'd  I little value while thy light supplies  Profuse invention let capricious chance  With obstacles and dangers gird me round  I can surmount them all nor peace nor war  Nor all the swift vicissitudes of time  E'er gave emergency a birth too strong  For me to govern On this crisis hangs  My future greatness whether joy or grief  Shall close the term of being none foreknow  My penetrating spirit I will trust  Thus far prophetic for a time at least  I will possess authority and pow'r  To fix a name enduring like the sun  Thus in his own strong faculties secure  To rest he tranquil sunk and slept till dawn  Then early rose Advancing from the shore  A manly figure he observes the face  Wrapt in a mantle as dividing clouds  Reveal th' unmuffled sun the mantle cast  Aside discovers the majestic front  Of Aristides who the silence breaks  Dissensions past as puerile and vain  Now to forget and nobly strive who best  Shall serve his country Aristides warns  His ancient foe Themistocles I hear  Thou giv'st the best of councils which the Greeks  Reject through mean solicitude to fly  Weak men throughout these narrow seas the foe  Is station'd now preventing all escape  Themistocles though covetous of fame  Though envying pow'r in others was not bred  In horrid deserts not with savage milk  Of tigers nurs'd nor bore a ruthless heart  He thus replied With gratitude this foe  Accepts thy welcome news thy proffer'd aid  Thy noble challenge in this glorious race  Be all our strife each other to surpass  First know my inmost secrets if the streights  Are all invested with Barbarian ships  The act is mine of our intended flight  I through Sicinus have appris'd the foes  Of his success thee messenger I hail  The exile then Such policy denotes  Themistocles I praise the Greeks have cause  To bless thy conduct teach me now what task  I can achieve to labour to advise  With thee commanding solely to enjoy  The secret pleasure of preserving Greece  Is my pursuit the glory all be thine  Before the council shew that honour'd face  Rejoins the chief report thy tidings there  To preparation for immediate fight  Exhort such notice they would slight in me  In thee all men believeThis said they mov'd  Them on their way Myronides approach'd  Xanthippus Cimon Aeschylus and all  The captains fixing reverential eyes  On Aristides this the wary son  Of Neocles remark'd he gains the town  Of Salamis the council there is met  To them th' illustrious exile he presents  At whose appearance all th' assembly rise  Save Adimantus fast by envy bound  He sits morose illib'ral then the word  As Aristides was in act to speak  Thus takes Boeotia Attica reduc'd  The Dorians Locrians you already know  To me this morn intelligence arriv'd  That Thespia that Platea were in flames  All Phocis conquer'd thus alone of Greece  The Isle of Pelops unsubdued remains  For what is lost ye Grecians must we face  Such mightier numbers while barbarian hate  Lurks in Psyttalia watching for the wrecks  Of our defeated navy Shall we pause  Now at the Isthmus with united force  To save a precious remnant Landing there  Your sailors turn to soldiers oars to spears  The only bulwark you have left defend  Then Aristides Ignominious flight  Necessity forbids Aegina's shore  Last night I left from knowledge I report  The hostile navy bars at either mouth  The narrow streight between Psyttalia's Isle  And Salamis where lie your anchor'd ships  But shall the Greeks be terrified What more  Can they solicit of propitious heav'n  Than such deluded enemies to face  Who trust in numbers yet provoke the fight  Where multitude is fruitlessClosing here  The unassuming exile straight retir'd  Cleander ent'ring heard while Corinth's chief  Blind with malignity and pride pursued  Her strength must Greece for Attica destroy'd  Waste on the credit of a single tongue  From Athens banish'd Swift Cleander spake  Is there in Greece who doubts that righteous tongue  Save Adimantus To suspect the truth  Of that illustrious exile were to prove  Ourselves both false and timid But enough  Of altercation from the fleet I come  The words of Aristides I confirm  Prepare to fight no passage have our ships  But through embattled foesThe council rose  In this tremendous season thronging round  Th' accomplish'd son of Neocles their hopes  In his unerring conduct all repose  Thus on Olympus round their father Jove  The deities collected when the war  Of earth's gigantic offspring menac'd heav'n  In his omnipotence of arm and mind  Confiding Eurybiades supreme  In title ev'ry leader speeds to act  What great Themistocles suggests himself  In all expedients copious seeks his wife  Whom he accosts encircled where she stood  With Attic dames Timothea now rejoice  The Greeks will fight tomorrow's sun will give  A glorious day of liberty to Greece  Assemble thou the women let the dawn  Behold you spread the Salaminian beach  In your selected ornaments attir'd  As when superb processions to the gods  Your presence graces with your children stand  Encompass'd cull your fairest daughters range  Them in the front alluring be their dress  Their beauties half discover'd half conceal'd  As when you practise on a lover's eye  Through that soft portal to invade the heart  So shall the faithful husband from his wife  Catch fire the father from his blooming race  The youthful warrior from the maid he loves  Your looks will sharpen our vindictive swords  In all the grace of polish'd Athens thus  His charge pronouncing with a kind embrace  He quits her bosom nor th' encircling dames  Without respectful admonition leaves  To aid his consort Grateful in itself  A task she soon begins which pleases more  As pleasing him A meadow fresh in green  Between the seabeat margin and the walls  Which bore the island's celebrated name  Extended large there oft the Attic fair  In bevies met Themistocles the ground  To them allotted that communion soft  Or pastime sweetly cheating might relieve  The sad remembrance of their native homes  Here at Timothea's summons they conven'd  In multitude beyond the daisies strewn  Thick o'er the verdure from the lap of spring  When most profuse The wives the mothers here  Of present heroes there in bud are seen  The future mothers of immortal sons  Of Socrates of Plato who to birth  Had never sprung if Xerxes had prevail'd  Or would have liv'd Barbarians On a mount  Timothea plac'd her graceful lips unclos'd  Ye wives ye mothers and ye fair betroth'd  Your husbands sons and suitors claim that aid  You have to give and never can so well  A signal day of liberty to Greece  Expect tomorrow of the glorious scene  Become spectators in a bridal dress  Ye wives encompass'd with your tender babes  Ye rev'rend matrons in your sumptuous robes  As when superb processions to the gods  Your presence graces but ye future brides  Now maids let all th' allurement of attire  Enhance your beauties to th' enamour'd eye  So from the face he loves shall ev'ry youth  Catch fire with animating passion look  On her and conquer Thus Cecropia's maids  Who left their country rather than abide  Impure compulsion to Barbarian beds  Or ply the foreign loom with servile hands  Shall live to see their hymeneal morn  Bless'd in heroic husbands shall transmit  To late posterity the Attic name  And you whose exemplary steps began  Our glorious emigration you shall see  Your lords your sons in triumph to your homes  Return ye matronsOr with them will die  If fortune frown Laodice aloud  For this I hold a poniard ere endure  A Persian yoke will pierce this female heart  Enthusiastic ardour seems to change  Their sex with manlike firmness all consent  To meet Timothea there by early dawn  In chosen raiment and with weapons arm'd  As chance should furnish Thus Timothea sway'd  The emulator of her husband's art  But ne'er beyond immaculate intent  At her suggestion interpos'd her friend  Laodice the consort young and fair  Of bold Aminias train'd by naval Mars  From the same bed with Aeschylus deriv'd  Troezene's leader passing by admir'd  The gen'rous flame but secretly rejoic'd  In Ariphilia at Calauria safe  He to thy tent Themistocles was bound  Thee to Sicinus list'ning just return'd  From his successful course Cleander found  Thee of thy dear Timothea first inform'd  While thou didst smile applause The youth pursued  From Aristides I deputed come  He will adventure from Psyttalia's isle  This night to chace the foe if thou concur  In help and counsel bands of Attic youth  Superfluous force excluded from the fleet  With ready arms the enterprize demand  Them with his troop Oïlean Medon joins  A noble Grecian sage experienc'd brave  Returns the chief my answer is concise  Sicinus fly their pinnaces and skiffs  Command th' Athenian vessels to supply  At Aristides' call th' attempt is wise  Becoming such a soldier thou remain  With him to bring me tidings of success  Swift as a stone from Balearic slings  Sicinus hastens to th' Athenian fleet  Cleander light th' important order bears  To Aristides whose exalted voice  Collects the banding youth So gen'rous hounds  The huntsman's call obey with ringing peals  Their throats in tune delight Aurora's ear  They pant impatient for the scented field  Devour in thought the victims of their speed  Nor dread the rav'nous wolf nor tusky boar  Nor lion king of beasts The exile feels  Returning warmth like some neglected steed  Of noblest temper from his wonted haunts  Who long hath languish'd in the lazy stall  Call'd forth he paws he snuffs th' enliv'ning air  His strength he proffers in a cheerful neigh  To scour the vale to mount the shelving hill  Or dash from thickets close the sprinkling dew  He thus to Medon Of Psyttalia's shore  That eastern flat contains the Persian chief  Known by his standard with four thousand youths  Make thy impression there the western end  Our foes neglect a high and craggy part  But nature there through perforated rock  Hath left a passage with its mouth above  Conceal'd in bushes this to me well known  I will possess thence rushing will surround  The unsuspecting Persian Darkness falls  Let all embark at midnight ply the oar  They hear and march allotted seats they take  Aboard the skiffs Sicinus had prepar'd  Impatient waiting but impatience keeps  Her peace The second watch is now elaps'd  That baneful season mark'd in legends old  When deathcontrolling sorcery compell'd  Unwilling spirits back to mortal clay  Entomb'd when dire Thessalian charmers call'd  Down from her orb the pallid queen of night  And hell's tremendous avenues unclos'd  To Asia's mothers now of real bane  Who soon must wail ten thousand slaughter'd sons  The boats in order move fullfac'd the moon  Extends the shadows of a thousand masts  Across the mirror of cerulean floods  Which feel no ruffling wind A western course  With his division Aristides steers  The Locrian eastward by whose dashing oars  A guard is rous'd not timely to obstruct  His firm descent yet ready on the strand  To give him battle Medon's spear by fate  Is wielded Locrians and Athenians sweep  The foes before them numbers fresh maintain  Unceasing conflict till on ev'ry side  His reinforcement Aristides pours  And turns the fight to carnage by his arm  Before a tent of stately structure sinks  Autarctus brave in death The twilight breaks  On heaps of slaughter not a Persian lives  But Artamanes from whose youthful brow  The beaver sever'd by th' auspicious steel  Of Medon shew'd a wellremember'd face  The Locrian swift embrac'd him and began  Deserve my kindness by some grateful news  Of Meliboeus and the Delphian priest  Not Aeschylus in pity shall exceed  My care in this thy second captive state  His grateful news the Persian thus repeats  Nicaea fort of Locris them contains  Though pris'ners happy in the guardian care  Of Artemisia What disastrous sight

 Abide compulsion to Barbarian beds  Their Attic arts and talents be debas'd  In Persian bondage Shall Cephissian banks  Callirhoë's fountain and Ilissus pure  Shall sweet Hymettus never hear again

urging sails and oars  Th' Athenians dash the waters which disturb'd  Combine their murmur with unnumber'd shouts  The gallies rush along like gliding clouds  That utter hollow thunder as they sweep  A distant ridge of hills The crowded lines  Of Xerxes' navy in the streights confus'd  Through their own weight and multitude ill steer'd  Are pierc'd by diff'rent squadrons which their chiefs  Each

chief  Whose arm whose conduct Destiny that day  Obey'd while fortune steady on her wheel  Look'd smiling down The regal flag descends  The democratic standard is uprear'd  Where that proud name of Eleutheria shines  In characters of silver Xerxes feels  A thrilling horror such as pierc'd the soul  Of pale Belshazzar last on Ninus' throne  When in the pleasures of his festive board  He saw the hand portentous on the wall  Of Babylon's high palace write his doom  With great Assyria's downfal Caria's queen  Not long continues in a distant post  Where bloodstain'd billows on her active oars  Dash thickadhering foam tremendous sight  To Adimantus who before her flies  With his dismay'd Corinthians She suspends  Pursuit her sov'reign's banner to redeem  Advances furious in her passage sends  Two ships to perish in the green abyss  With all their numbers this her sov'reign sees  Exclaiming loud my women fight like men  The men like women Fruitless yet her skill  Her courage vain

 A favour'd lord expressing in his look  A sign of pity to partake their doom  The tyrant wild commands Argestes' heart  Admits a secret joy at Persia's foil  He trusts that blind by fear th' uncertain prince  To him his wonted favour would restore  Would crush Mardonius author of the war  Beneath his royal vengeance or that chief  By adverse fate oppress'd his sway resign  But as the winds or thunders never shook  Deeprooted Aetna nor the pregnant clouds  Discharg'd a flood extinguishing his fires  Which inexhausted boil the surging mass  Of fumy sulphur so this grim event  Shook not Mardonius in whose bosom glow'd  His courage still unquench'd despising chance  With all her band of evils In himself  Collected on calamity he founds  A new heroic structure in his mind  A plan of glory forms to conquer Greece  By his own prowess or by death atone  For his unprosp'rous counsels Xerxes now  Amid the wrecks and slaughter in his sight  Distracted vents his disappointed pride  Have I not sever'd from the side of Thrace  Mount Athos bridg'd the Hellespont Go fill  Yon sea construct a causeway broad and firm  As o'er a plain my army shall advance  To overwhelm th' Athenians in their isle  He rises back to Athens he repairs  Sequester'd languid him Mardonius finds  Deliv'ring bold this soliderly address  Be not discourag'd sov'reign of the world  Not oars not sails and timber can decide  Thy enterprize sublime In shifting strife  By winds and billows govern'd may contend  The sons of traffic on the solid plain  The gen'rous steed and soldier they alone  Thy glory must establish where no swell  Of fickle floods nor breath of casual gales  Assist the skilful coward and controul  By nature's wanton but resistless might  The brave man's arm Unaided by her hand  Not one of these light mariners will face  Thy regal presence at the Isthmian fence  To that small part of yet unconquer'd Greece  The land of Pelops Seek the Spartans there  There let the slain Leonidas revive  With all his warriors whom thy pow'r destroy'd  A second time their gen'rous blood shall dye  The sword of Asia Sons of those who tore  Th' Assyrian Lydian scepters from their kings  Thy Medes and Persians whose triumphant arms  From distant shores of Hellespont have tam'd  Such martial nations have thy trophies rais'd  In Athens bold aggressor they shall plant  Before thy sight on fam'd Eurota's shore  Th' imperial standard and repair the shame  Of that uncertain flutt'ring naval flag  The sport of winds The monarch's look betray'd  That to expose his person was the least  Of his resolves Mardonius pierc'd his thoughts  And thus in manly policy pursued  If Susa long forlorn at length may claim  The royal presence if the gracious thought  Of his return inspire my sov'reign's breast  Throughout his empire to rekindle joy  Let no dishonour on thy Persians fall  Thy Medes not they accomplices in flight  With vile Aegyptians with Cilicians base  Pamphylians Cyprians Let not Greece deride  A baffled effort in a gallant race  Who under Cyrus triumph'd whom to fame  Darius led and thou with recent wreaths  O conqueror of Athens hast adorn'd  Since they are blameless though thy will decree  Thy own return and wisely would secure  Superfluous millions in their native homes  Before chill winter in his barren arms  Constrain the genial earth yet leave behind  But thirty myriads of selected bands  To my command I pledge my head that Greece  Shall soon be Persia's vassal Xerxes pleas'd  Concealing yet that pleasure artful thus  Deliberation to thy counsel due  Shall be devoted call the Carian queen  She then was landed through Cecropia's streets  A solemn bier she follow'd where the corse  Of Ariabignes lay Mardonius met  And thus address'd her Meritorious dame  Of all the myriads whom retreat hath sav'd  Hail crown'd with honour Xerxes thro' my voice  Requires thy counsel to decide on mine  I add no more thy wisdom candour faith  I trust without a murmur will submit  To thy decision but to thine alone  My care shall tend that clay among the dead  Perhaps the only gloriousShe departs  He seeks the Magi greeted in these words  Receive this body all which now remains  Of Ariabignes let no dirge deplore  Him as unhappy Horomazes smiles  On such a death your lamentations vent  On human nature humbled and debas'd  By cowards traitors who surviv'd this day  Ne'er to outlive their shame Ye vet'ran bands  Of Medes and Persians who surround in tears  These honour'd reliques warriors who subdued  The banks of Nile where Hyperanthes

this illustrious dead  From this enthrall'd metropolis of Greece  Shall carry devastation sword and flames  To Lacedaemon now your only foe  The native Medes and Persians at his words  Are fir'd in strength in courage not unlike  Their brave commander who in scorn beheld  Th' inferior herds of nations Now the sun  Glows on the ocean To his tent retires  Mardonius sternly in his wounded soul  The late disgrace of Xerxes he revolves  Yet soothes his anguish by enliv'ning hope  Of glory Thus the tawny king of beasts  Who o'er Numidian wastes hath lost a day  In fruitless chace of wonted food depriv'd  Growls in his den but meditates a range  Enlarg'd and ceaseless through unbounded woods  To glut his empty maw Her charge perform'd  Before him sudden Artemisia stands  As Cynthia steps

Wouldst separate and boldly at their head  Thy life adventure Xerxes may assume  A doubtful aspect Counsel given by thee  By me approv'd Argestes may oppose  With all his malice Only thou suppress  The fiery sparks which animate thy blood  In patience wait thy dictates will prevail  Our common vengeance too that traitor feel  Whom I saw lurking near the king's retreat  FarewelShe leaves him happy in her voice  Of approbation happier in her eye  Which spoke for his prosperity a wish  That eye enlight'ning her majestic face  With added lustre from his grateful sense  Of her transcendent talents thus applied  To his behoof His manly bosom feels  Beyond a veneration of her worth  Beyond a friendship to her friendship due  Desire of her society in war  Perhaps in peace Participated thoughts  With her united counsels he esteems  A gain to both His highaspiring soul  Enjoys the thought nor entertains a shade  Of jealousy or envy at her fame  He ruminates Observing her advice  I shall succeed Then startingEarth and heaven  Where is Masistius Oh ungen'rous heart  Which on the scent of its ambitious chace  Forgot that best of counsellors and guides  Friend of my infant youthful

his course  The son of Gobryas and the Carian queen  Were thus remov'd Argestes in that hour  Obtain'd access to Xerxes Cold with fear  By fortune tam'd tormented still by pride  Th' uncertain king to him their counsel told  When thus Argestes feigning wonder spake  Dost thou appoint Mardonius king in Greece  O liberal prince what servant in thy train  Would not confront all danger to possess  An empire which the Hellespont alone  Will bound Already Macedonia's lord  Young Alexander all the Thracian chiefs  Like humble vassals to Mardonius bend  Why should the king himself not conquer Greece  Now more than half reduc'd Complete the work  Appointed choak the Salaminian floods  O'erwhelm th' Athenians in their isle and reign  Thyself supreme The monarch starts and wild  In look commands

Thou sleep'st thy wretched sister lives to see  Her children butcher'dOn the pavement damp  She threw her limbs she clasp'd her lovely babes  They shudd'ring view Sandauce in distress  Too young to

still Our climate holds  All Asia now her princes wealth and arms  I can detain her till consuming time  By famine sword and pestilence exhaust  Her strength and cover Greece with Persian graves  Too high thy ardour mounts replies the sage  Forbear to think of strength'ning such a pow'r  By desperation To the feeble brute  Necessity gives courage Such a host  Of men and steeds innum'rous on our fields  By nature's stimulating wants compell'd  To fight for life might blast our budding hopes  Ah rather some new stratagem devise  To send the Persians back let famine want  Let pestilence pursue their tedious flight  Depriv'd of succour from their vanquish'd fleet  Which do thou chace and bury in the waves  Farewell my post demands me Since their foil  I have observ'd the enemies employ'd  In

Her infant train and this ingenuous youth  With my best greetings Say the Athenian chief  Themistocles these pledges of his truth  And friendship sends them rescued I restore  Him next will save His Hellespontine bridge  The Greeks vindictive menace to destroy  An enterprize of horror this my pow'r  My dictates singly can and shall impede  Till he in safety hath regain'd his throne  Sandauce

Inferior mortals when my soul reflects  On this new lesson by misfortune taught  Reflects how lately on a field of blood  Young as I am I saw my husband fall  My children doom'd to sacrifice myself  To endless bondage had not heav'n achiev'd  This marvel of compassion in a foe  I O forgive me I suspect the lot  Of all ev'n thine O prosp'rous godlike man  May Horomazes from thy head avert  Vicissitudes like mine may envious fate  Ne'er bring Sandauce's gratitude to proof  Thou never want the pity thou hast shewn  She ceas'd she wept When Artamanes spake  Her debt Sandauce can discharge alone  By grateful tears but I can promise more  In Persian thraldom lies a beauteous Greek  Nam'd Amarantha Delphian Timon's child  For that bright maid's redemption I am pledg'd  To her afflicted sire Thy goodness shower'd  On this excelling princess shall augment  My zeal the obligation to repay  By Amarantha's freedom till that hour  Of retribution to thy virtues comes  We will proclaim them nations shall admire  Themistocles and ev'ry heart abhor  Inhuman Euphrantides Now return'd  Sicinus him they follow'd On her breast  The lovely mother hush'd her female babe  But cold with horror at remembrance deep  Of her unmatch'd calamities that day  She feebly falter'd o'er the sandy beach  While Artamanes led in either hand  The tripping boys Themistocles remain'd  In these reflections flowing from this proof  Of fortune's changes Few in Athens long  Sustain their greatnessbut to muse on ills  Before they come both time and thought I waste  Content at present that esteem procur'd  By this fair Persian in her brother's court  May prove a gain Timothea now approach'd  His hand affectionate she press'd and spake  How sudden thou my hospitable cares  Of their endearing object hast depriv'd  In woe how graceful is that eastern dame  How young a mother On a widow'd bed  How early cast by fortune Thou hast sent  Sicinus with her everwatchful man  Some new contrivance thou dost bring to birth  Thou smil'st in silence listen then to me  Since Aristides on this isle hath shewn  That face rever'd when banish'd his recal  The men of Athens nay the women wish  This by Aminias to th' assembled tribes  Laodice informs me will be mov'd  In this expect Myronides the brave  Xanthippus Cimon Aeschylus will join  So will thy husband interpos'd the chief  I will forestall them not to others leave  Such merit with our peopleShe rejoin'd  All will applaud thee Now my anxious lord  The second watch its measure hath consum'd  The moon descends the sprightly birds are still  Dead sleep hath laid the soldier on his shield  The active sailor slumbers all forget  The hardships rage and tumult of the day  All but thyself reposing Shall that mind  Continue ranging o'er the field of thought  In pregnancy exhaustless till the lark  Salute the dayspring with his early song  Till thou unresting unrefresh'd resume  The statesman's troubles and the soldier's toils  Be counsell'd oft the thunderbearing god  To Juno listens thou my voice obey  He hears serene conducts her to repose  As Jove on Ida by Saturnia charm'd  Confess'd a rapture never felt before  While lucid dew of odours from a cloud  Of gold distill'd around him from the turf  Beneath his feet while hyacinths upsprung  The unctuous lotos and the crocus gay  To grace his secret tabernacle there  Of love celestial so the Attic chief  To his Timothea in her chamber pure  With bridal honours deck'd perfum'd with flow'rs  Whate'er the meads of Salamis supplied  His tender flame in winning language breath'd  Whoe'er had whisper'd on our nuptial day  That I should view thee in a time remote  From that sweet aera with superior joy  I should have held him ignorant of love  What is the cause Timothea that I feel  My bosom pierc'd by transport yet unknown  That eastern fair deliver'd from distress  Appearing then the fairest of her sex  Thou dost exceed Timothea smiling spake  O thou artificer of sweetest wiles  Wouldst thou seduce me into vain belief  That I exceed Sandauce's youthful charms  But wouldst thou know my husband solemn here  She modulates her accents wouldst thou know  Why thou survey'st me with uncommon joy  It is the conscience of a noble deed  Of gather'd trophies never match'd before  Creates this change The perils of this day  Were new to Athens to thy race and me  Thy sword hath rescued all increas'd thy fame  Thy heart exalted with increas'd delight  Thro' that bright medium of a happy mind  Thou look'st on ev'ry objectsure on me  Not less than others Artless were these words  By nature prompted nature's noblest fire  They ceas'd discourse Her loftiness of mind  His valour talents policy to love  Subside Perhaps the first of human pairs  Who in the bless'd Assyrian garden met  Were not more happy in their first embrace  Than fair Timothea and her conqu'ring lord  A pleasing stillness on the water sleeps  The land is hush'd from either host proceeds  No sound no murmur With his precious charge  Embark'd Sicinus gently steers along  The dip of oars in unison awake  Without alarming silence while the moon  From her descending horizontal car  Shoots lambent silver on the humid blades  Which cleave the curling slood On carpets soft  Sandauce's babes devoid of sorrow lie  In sweet oblivious innocence compos'd  To smiling slumber But the mother's breast  Admits no consolation when they skim  Psyttalia's frith at memory severe  Of that disast'rous isle she sudden sinks  A lifeless image in the watchful arms  Of Artamanes who had studied well  Her sorrows knew each tender thought and care  Humanity his tutor Swift he calls  Sicinus Friendly pilot stay thy course  We must not leave Autarctus in his gore  Behind lest grief incurable reside  In this fair breast perhaps eternal shade  In these extinguish'd eyes Sicinus feels  A sympathizing pain of Persian stock  Himself a branch in Attic soil matur'd  He stops the bark and lands The Asian tents  Were still erect whence Aristides comes  In steel accoutred to salute the dawn  Then breaking Him Sicinus humbly greets  Requests obtains the body which convey'd  On board he careful on the deck bespreads  With canvass new Impell'd by active strokes  Of oars resum'd the bounding vessel gains  Phaleron's haven Artemisia there  Whose vigilance augmented by defeat  Had kenn'd the bark while distant now arrests  Her further progress but no sooner hears  The sad intelligence Sicinus gives  Than swift descending where Sandauce lay  That mourning fair in friendly strains accosts  O lift thy head thou daughter of a king  Our sov'reign's sister sister to the man  My soul rever'd to Hyperanthes good  The flow'r of Asia's princes In thy woes  I sharing cordial cordially rejoice  In thy redemption Leave this doleful keel  Think of thy duty to approach the king  Thy other cares entrust to meShe said  They row to shore To Xerxes then retir'd  The queen conducts Sandauce and her train  The princess thus to him amaz'd began  A widow'd sister late a wretched slave  With these three orphans just redeem'd from death  Sandauce greets her brother but her tongue  Would be disloyal to obtrude her tale  Her tedious tale of sorrows on his ear  The preservation of her king demands  His first attention that attention grant  To him who comes deputed by a Greek  Thy friend my guardian saviour of those babes  Oh listen thy salvation from his lips  Receive Fast bound by terror was the mouth  Of XerxesThen Sicinus He who ranks  Among the Greeks superior in command  In talents prudence policy and arms  Themistocles these pledges of his truth  And friendship sends them rescued he restores  Thee next will save Thy Hellespontine bridge  The Greeks vindictive menace to destroy  An enterprize of horror which his pow'r  His dictates singly can and will impede  Till thou in safety hast regain'd thy throne  All from his presence straight the king commands  Save Artemisia her in broken tones  Addresses Queen of Caria singly wise  Among my council pity not upbraid  Thy master suff'ring by his rash neglect  Of thy sage voice unutterable pangs  He paus'd in torture Prudent she replied  Without a cause the lord of nations droops  Mardonius well hath counsel'd thy retreat  Who undertakes to finish what his sword  Hath well begun thro' Macedon and Thrace  This mighty war Thy servant may succeed  In whose behalf His master's Thou wilt reap  His fruits of glory if Mardonius fail  He the disgrace Thy march commence by dawn  Appoint the fleet's departure swift this night  To guard with force collected and repair'd  The Hellespontine bridge with grace accept  The proffer'd service of th' Athenian chief  Load his returning messenger with gifts  Of royal price and O my gracious lord  Fraternal kindness on Sandauce show'r  Her gallant lord hath perish'd in thy cause  Herself been menac'd by a barb'rous priest  To see her children sacrific'd a doom  Themistocles withstood and set them free  As when a timid child perceives a cloud  Obscure the sky and hears the thunder's peal  He weeps he trembles but the cloud dispers'd  The clamour ceasing and the sun restor'd  His wonted sport resumes forgetting fear  So chang'd the monarch Artemisia go  He said the satraps instantly convene  Th' Athenian messenger Argestes' son  Again before us with Sandauce call  Ne'er will I deviate from thy counsels more  First to Sicinus ent'ring he began  Say to thy sender I accept well pleas'd  His service pass'd and proffers thou return  To him ten golden talents thou shalt bear  Thee from the depths of sorrow shall the king  Sandauce raise demand a present boon  Thou canst not ask what Xerxes will refuse  By gratitude surmounting grief inspir'd  Mov'd to retaliate kindness in the shape  Herself had prov'd the gen'rous suppliant thus  In Persian thraldom is a Grecian maid  Of Delphian lineage Amarantha nam'd  Her I demand of Xerxes that my hand  A captive daughter to a tender sire  May render back from bondage free his head  Now in Nicaea and thus far my debt  Of gratitude discharge In transport here  Admiring such perfection of the heart  Spake Artamanes Ever live the king  There is a captive whom the princess nam'd  Fly thou in search of this requested slave  Son of Argestes interrupts the king  Let none withold her from Sandauce's pow'r  The female train before the cumb'rous host  Shall move by dawn for Thessaly there join  The rest of Asia's dames behind us left  On our late march the guard ten thousand horse  Thou Artamanes shalt commandHe said  They all retir'd A pensive grief o'ercasts  Sandauce moving with her children slow  By slaves attended to the vacant tent  Autarctus late possess'd Argestes' son  Observes her anguish penetrates her thoughts  In guarded words then proffers this relief  O fairest princess whose external form  But half displays thy excellence of mind  Wilt thou forgive thy servant if he feels  With thee a present sorrow which the heart  Fobids the tongue to name Sandauce trust  My pious service and those thoughts compose  She weeping looks assent he speeds away  But meets the body of Autarctus borne  By Artemisia's soldiers She at first  With care conceal'd had order'd from the bark  His precious reliques these the noble youth  With equal care delivers to that skill  Which with Sabaean gums and scented growths  Of bless'd Arabia purifies the clay  Depriv'd of life and Time's consuming breath  Repels A regal car he next provides  In full apparel of funereal pomp  End of the Seventh Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the EIGHTH  THE satraps now and leaders at the call  Of Artemisia were collected round  Their monarch Seated on his throne he spake  Ye princes satraps heed our fix'd decree  Our native Asia wants her king by morn  To Susa we return but leave behind  In Greece Mardonius and a chosen host  Of thirty myriads With command supreme  With our imperial equipage and state  Him we invest to him submission pay  As to our presence Artemisia bear  Our sov'reign pleasure to the naval chiefs  That all abandon e'er the dawn return  Phaleron's port and hoist their sails to guard  The Hellespont But thou entrusted queen  Thy own tried squadron to Spercheos bring  Whence thou must waft to Ephesus a charge  Of high import the children of thy king  He ceas'd A stranger cas'd in steel approach'd  In look ferocious limbs and shape robust  Of stature huge the satraps look'd amaz'd  As were th' immortals when th' Olympian steep  Ascending grim Briareus first produc'd  His mountainbulk and spread his hundred hands  Auxiliary to Jove The warrior stood  Unbending far as nature would permit  His rugged brow when crouching to the king  O Xerxes live for ever he began  I am Euboean Demonax the prince  Of Oreus late who earth and water sent  Acknowledging thy empire from my throne  By curs'd Themistocles expell'd I join'd  Thy shelt'ring fleet at Salamis I fought  An aid of troops and treasure can replace  Me thy true vassal who will soon reduce  The granary of Athens to thy sway  Euboea fertile populous and rich  The monarch thus Mardonius thou hast heard  Begin to use thy plenitude of pow'r  Reject or favour at thy will this pray'r  Mardonius then My sov'reign liege the truth  Flows from his lips twelve thousand of thy host  With Mindarus commanding and of gold  A hundred talents would be well bestow'd  On this important Greek The king assents  He rises all disperse Mardonius now  Accosts the queen descending to the port  Alas how uncontrollable the will  Of Xerxes must thou leave me Since the day  Of Salamis my best belov'd of friends  Masistius whether by the waves devour'd  Or slain or captive to my search is lost  Foe to inaction though compos'd and wise  Of courage prone to perilous attempts  He would embark permitted by the king  Against my warm remonstrance would partake  The naval conflict Drooping while I doubt  His preservation must I further lose  Thy fellowship auspicious generous queen  Yet stop a moment listen On the march  To Athens first reposing in a cave  I had a dream perhaps a vision saw  To me presaging glorybut success  Was wrap'd in clouded mystery My heart  Teems with illboding thoughts yet shall not faint  At least impart thy wishes ere thou sail'st  Thy last instructions Fortunate thy voice  Benign to me repeat one parting strain  If I successful to thy presence bring  The palms of conquest say accomplish'd queen  Thou wilt accept them with a gracious hand  If unsuccessful I the forfeit pay  Of this frail being as becomes the brave  Say thou wilt praise Mardonius Sage and grave  She answers First despair not to regain  The good Masistius at the worst endure  That common lot the death of dearest friends  With patience long thy courage I have prais'd  Now moderate the flame against a foe  Not less discreet than disciplin'd and bold  Nor let the gloom of superstition awe  Thy noble ardour On the sharpest sword  The strongest arm on prudence martial skill  Not dreams and visions looks the goddess Fame  If Artemisia's wishes can avail  Be sure to prosper prosp'ring here to soar  Above the flight of CyrusShe departs  Behind her like the sinking globe of day  She leaves a trail of radiance on his soul  But to protect him from returning shade  Her light should ne'er forsake him never set  O'er gen'rous cares not thus Argestes broods  Within his tent he meditates conceal'd  By struggling pride tormented thus he strives  To sooth her pangs I see my pow'r eclips'd  Mardonius governs Pow'r thou fleeting gleam  Thee I possess no longer why regret  When Amarantha's beauty can exchange  Thy thorns for lilies To my own domain  I will transport her Sipylus hath flow'rs  To drop perfumes in Amarantha's walk  Pactolus Hermus my subjected streams  Shall furnish gold her gems shall India send  To deck that form and I in pleasure's folds  Forget ambition stranger to the peace  Which honour yields Libidinous in thought  The statesman thus would cheat his baffled pride  Accurs'd of men who borrow'd from one vice  His med'cine for another both deform  His ravag'd bosom in alternate strife  Flagitious parent rivalling in love  His eldest born prepost'rous passion big  With horror while the youngest lov'd by all  By Xerxes favour'd to Mardonius dear  He held in detestation for his worth  Nor knew the comfort of a virtuous child  With diff'rent thoughts that sleepless youth employ'd  The night serenely happy in the charge  Humanity impos'd Before the dawn  His band is arm'd Sandauce in her car  Among innumerable fair the chief  In state and woe Tears trickle at the sight  Of great Autarctus in his fun'ral pomp  Down ev'ry cheek a solemn sadness reigns  So oft Aurora sablesuited leads  A train of clouds dissolving as they pass  In silent show'rs Through Attica's waste fields  Through half Boeotia ere his ev'ning clos'd  The second sun conducts them to the gates  Of antient Thebes They enter they ascend  The citadel they find commanding there  New from the ruins of unpeopled towns  Fierce Mithridates With a kind embrace  To him the gentle Artamanes thus  Hail brother twice a captive since we last  At Delphi parted I would gladly know  Thy fortune Tell me where that beauteous maid  Whom thou didst carry from the Delphian walls  The grim Barbarian spoiler quick reply'd  Curs'd be her name her beauty which could melt  A heart like mine Accurs'd my father's lust  Which seiz'd my captive Guarded by a troop  Of jealous eunuchs and attendants arm'd  Her in this citadel he still detains  If I refign her may Plataea's tow'rs  May Thespia's hostile walls by me o'erthrown  A second time to brave me rise from dust  Oh unbecoming strife the brother cry'd  Which startles nature Thanks to Heav'n the king  Hath now decided Amarantha's fate  Her to his royal sister he hath giv'n  A promis'd boon Sandauce by the foe  Restor'd to freedom will requite that grace  By rend'ring up this damsel to her sire  Himself a pris'ner in Nicaea's fort  Then both release from bondage Further know  In Thebes to morrow Xerxes will appear  On his retreat to Susa I conduct  This train of eastern dames By rising dawn  To her protection will the princess take  The Delphian maiden then proceed These words  Sting Mithridates an atrocious deed  He meditates but artful thus conceals  Not to my father to the king I yield  This said they parted Mithridates held  The town his brother's squadrons lay encamp'd  Without the walls The citadel contain'd  A fane of Juno there Sandauce rests  To Oedipus devoted was a dome  Which Artamanes enter'd while his heart  Ran cold and shudder'd at a brother fell  And treach'rous sire competitors in love  Abominable strife His eyes he cast  O'er all the structure lighted by the gleams  Of tapers blue attending he surveys  Insculptur'd round the horrors which befel  The house of Laius there th' illfated son  His father slays incestuous there ascends  His mother's chamber daughters he begets  His sisters sons his brothers blameless he  A man of virtues by despair oppress'd  Rends forth his eyeballs on the pavement dash'd  There sev'n dire captains leagu'd by horrid oaths  Which startled Heav'n are figur'd down to Hell  Amphiarāus on his martial car  Through earth's dividing entrails there descends  Here Capaneus blaspheming Jove expires  Amid vindictive lightnings mangled there  Eteocles and Polynices fall  Each other's victim to fraternal hate  Full of these hideous images the youth  Reclines disturb'd unvisited by sleep  Till awful midnight broken slumber adds  To his disquiet In a thrilling dream  The eyeless ghost of Oedipus ascends  The vacant sockets where the orbs of sight  Once beam'd are bleeding fresh a Stygian pall  Infolds the wither'd pale sepulchral form  The arms are stretch'd abroad Forever Thebes  Must thou to horror be the guilty stage  It said and vanish'd By the phantom wak'd  Or by a sudden clash of mingling swords  With skrieks and tumult Artamanes rose  Unsheath'd his sabre grip'd his target fast  And issued swift Before his startled eyes  A beauteous woman of majestic form  In garb disorder'd and with ringlets fall'n  Sustains aloft a poinard newly drawn  From Mithridates' heart who sinking breathes  His last beneath her feet So Phoebe pierc'd  Orion so the groaning earth receiv'd  His giant bulk which insolently dar'd  Attempt that child immaculate of Jove  With violence of love Now spake the fair  If to defend her chastity and fame  Becomes a woman self approv'd at least  I stand great Timon's daughter from a line  Heroic sprung in holy Delphi born  If to have slain a ruffian be a crime  Among the Persians give me instant death  Such as becomes my dignity and sex  Her words her looks impress'd on ev'ry heart  Amaze and tam'd the savages combin'd  With Mithridates in his impious act  So when majestic on the choral scene  Her tragic pomp Melpomene displays  In awe profound she hushes rudest minds  While terror humbles tyrants Gather'd round  Were numbers now a thousand torches blaz'd  Sandauce last environ'd by her guard  Approach'd alarm'd A wounded eunuch stepp'd  Before the princess I will cloath in truth  My voice he said Argestes to my care  Entrusted Amarantha from that lord  Solicitations threat'nings gifts she spurn'd  While I admir'd Sure virtue hath a ray  To strike the meanest eye Tonight his son  Assail'd our dwelling with my fellow slaves  All butcher'd I defended long my charge  By Mithridates from the mansion forc'd  Her chastity the noble maid hath sav'd  Her poniard stretch'd the ravisher in blood  To Artamanes weeping o'er the corse  Sandauce then To thy consoling words  I oft have listen'd listen thou to mine  Forgive the maid illustrious is her deed  For every maid to imitate With me  Come Amarantha thou art mine not long  Shalt so continue at Nicaea's fort  I will restore thee to a joyful sire  And both to freedom Morning breaks the cars  The troops attend the royal dame renews  Her progress seated at her footstool weeps  In speechless gratitude the Delphian fair  By public duty Artamanes rous'd  Not long remains This last farewell he sighs  Oh early fall'n Oh cut from proudest hopes  Thee Horomazes may a brother's tears  For him propitiate he hath none to shed  These silent ruins to our father shew  Thou faithful eunuch May he feel like me  His steed he mounts and rapidly o'ertakes  The squadrons op'ning on Cadmean plains  Now Amarantha lifts her grateful head  Intent to speak but heavy on the front  Of her protectress heavier in her breast  Sat grief each sense devouring and her frame  Enfeebling which too delicately wrought  Endures not ev'n remembrance of distress  So new so strange in her exalted state  To youth untry'd by evils She forgets  Her late benignant act till chance directs  Her eye to Amarantha when her heart  Sooth'd by the conscience of a gen'rous deed  Her faded cheeks relumines with a smile  Then spake the prudent virgin Persian queen  Sure such thou art what marvellous event  Gave thee a knowledge of my sire his place  Of residence and my disastrous fate  Sense of thy goodness from my breast would chace  The memory of troubles if alas  I did not see thy countenance o'ercast  If thou repent thee of thy favour deem  Me undeserving send me to abide  The punishment ordain'd by Persian laws  But if thy sorrows are thy own unmix'd  With my misfortunes let assiduous zeal  Let tenderest service of my grateful hand  Strive to relieve the burdens which oppress  My benefactress In the captive's hand  Sandauce drops her own in sighs replies  O by thy aspect of superior mold  To all I e'er beheld of regal race  Resembling me in fortune lend an ear  My soul conceives a melancholy wish  That thou shouldst hear my story I to thine  Alternate listen Mournful converse soon  Between these fairest in their native climes  Began continued sev'n diurnal rounds  The sun perform'd till intercourse of grief  Communicated sighs unite their minds  In tender friendship Diff'rent yet their lots  On Amarantha's cheek the bloom revives  A joyful sire perhaps a dear betroth'd  Her fortune promis'd In Sandauce's train  A husband follow'd on his fun'ral bier  Her fleeting hue a sickly paleness taints  Which Artamanes with a sad'ning eye  Observes portent of malady Now rose  The eighth sad morn revealing to their sight  Nicaea's neighb'ring gate Sandauce then  To Artamanes Take this virtuous maid  To her my promise to her father thine  Fulfill conduct her Amarantha dear  From thee I part rejoicing in thy joy  Amid thy comforts in a sire's embrace  Or bliss more tender with a destin'd spouse  Forget not me Autarchus near the tomb  Of Ariana by these widow'd hands  DepositedShe stops the weaken'd pow'rs  Of health relax nor furnish sound to grief  Mute too is Delphi's maid The Persian youth  To leave a moment in her sick'ning state  The princess feels a struggle but resolves  In rapid haste her mandate to obey  Nicaea's gate he enters Timon soon  He finds receive thy daughter swift he spake  Receive thy freedom from the bounteous hand  Of Xerxes' sister but a short farewell  My urgent cares allow to set thee free  At thy own time I hasten to enjoin  The chief commander here He said and turn'd  Precipitate away unheard unmark'd  By Timon who no other voice nor form  Than Amarantha's heeds In Carian steel  Now Meliboeus from the gymnic school  Where he was daily exercis'd in arms  Approach'd to him in transport Timon spake  Behold my daughterInstant from the port  Appears Aronces who proclaims the news  Of Artemisia landed She had left  Phaleron station'd in the Malian bay  She waits the king's arrival not remote  Now with his army all advance to meet  The Carian queen when sudden clouds of dust  The sky envelop loud the hollow sound  Of trampling hoofs is heard The portal pass'd  By Artamanes fac'd the southern sun  An entrance eastward rudely is possess'd  By Caspian horsemen in the hairy skins  Of goats all horrid round their brawny loins  From shaggy belts keen cimeters depend  Wellfurnish'd quivers rattle on their backs  Now fifty grimfac'd savages dismount  To seize on Amarantha Then his arm  Newtrain'd to battle Meliboeus proves  With native strength agility and fire  He springs confronts the Caspians from the first  He lops the ruffian hand by diff'rent wounds  Five more lie prostrate As a vessel new  Compact and strong impetuous from the dock  In her first launch divides the troubled waves  On either side recoiling till the weight  Of reuniting waters stops her course  And beats her lofty ribs so valour drives  The warrior on till rallying numbers join'd  Arrest his progress fearless yet he stands  A while defensive Timon from the dead  Lifts two forsaken cimeters both hands  His indignation arms he sends to hell  Three miscreants gasping at his daughter's feet  With aiding Thefeus so Pirithous heap'd  With centaurs slain the Lapithaean hall  When in flagitious tumult they deform'd  The nuptial banquet and his fair espous'd  With violation menac'd But the eye  Of Amarantha mark'd th' unequal fight  Her poniard drawn the only succour left  She holds intrepid resolute on death  No second thraldom when th' auspicious sight  Of Caria's queen revives her fainting hopes  Stern Artemisia rapid on the call  Of vigilant Aronces now approach'd  In awful tone the Caspians Sheath your blades  Ye fierce in look not courage or this arm  Her falchion here she waves shall hide these streets  With your vile carrion Despicable herd  Of rebels led by what presumptuous fiend  Dare you invade a fortress of your king  Ev'n in my presence he perhaps in sight  They hear they pause Inclos'd by thick'ning guards  In multitude confiding urg'd by lust  Which lends a courage new Argestes fell  Inciting loud his ruffians to persist  Strikes her indignant eye What wrath what hopes  Of just of longsought vengeance swell her breast  As when the mother of a lion brood  From wonted chace returning sees a wolf  Or treach'rous tiger stealing towards her den  Who in her absence would securely prey  On her defenceless whelps her eyeballs roll  In fire she rushes on th' insidious foe  With fangs resistless he contends in vain  His chest she rends asunder and his heart  Devours unsated so incens'd the queen  Begirt by Carians terrible in war  To each Barbarian terrible who saw  Their high exploits on Salaminian waves  Rush'd on Argestes Meliboeus brave  March'd by her side a second whom the god  Of arms might rank among his foremost sons  The Caspians shrunk by desperation bold  The satrap spurr'd his courser on the queen  And whirl'd a javelin shiv'ring on her shield  She on the forehead smote the restiff horse  Who rearing hurl'd his rider to the ground  Then points her dreadful weapon tow'rds the breast  Of her detested foe intent to pierce  The trait'rous heart This invocation first  She solemn utters Manes of the brave  Whom he devoted on the Malian fields  Unpitied victims of his hate to me  To you my subjects this malignant head  I immolate Hence satrap once the chief  In pow'r and state in vice and falsehood chief  Seek Rhadamanthus tell him while he frowns  On his tribunal Themis to my hand  Her sword resign'd to cut thy treason short  Her vengeance levels now the mortal blow  When dignity restrains her Rise she said  Thou criminal unworthy by this arm  To die preserve him Carians to abide  The ignominous lot by justice doom'd  To common villains Meliboeus change  Thy name I clasp thee Haliartus now  My brother prov'd by gallant deeds at least  No evidence but virtue I require  For nobler union than congenial birth  By friendship's sacred ties to call thee mine  She scarce had finish'd when a second troop  Of horsemen through the southern portal spread  New terror In their front a splendid chief  Who wears a regal circle round he casts  A searching eye impatient soon beholds  Bright Amarantha where she stands beset  By Caspians strangers to their leader's fate  Persisting still in pertinacious strife  Against Aronces and her manly sire  Then swift as sulph'rous ether when its flame  Divides a knotted oak or cleaves a tow'r  Flies on the ruffians Do ye lift he cries  Your hands profane against the destin'd queen  Of Macedon a carnage wide he spreads  Beneath his trampling steed and pond'rous blade  Dismounting victor he unclasps his helm  Her dear betroth'd to Amarantha shews  In Alexander Macedonia's king  Ne'er yet so comely so endearing look'd  A lover rescu'd from Barbarian spoil  She meets his arms while Timon weeps in joy  With Meliboeus from a stage of blood  The Carian queen approach'd while thus the king  His servent soul was opening Oh my love  My Amarantha my affianc'd love  I feel but cannot paint my sorrows past  My present joys The day the appointed day  To solemnize our nuptial rites was nigh  I left my kingdom flew to Delphi's walls  Thou wast not there What horror when I heard  Thou wast a captive by what barb'rous hand  None could inform me thence from march to march  I track'd the Persians tidings of thy fate  No tongue could tell through Attica I rang'd  Boeotia Phocis Doris Locris still  Was left to search Disconsolate I join'd  The royal camp last ev'ning there I heard  Of Mithridates by thy virtue slain  At Thebes of curs'd Argestes who had held  Thee pris'ner there of thy departure thence  With kind Sandauce to Nicaea's fort  But further told that base Argestes led  The Caspian horse forerunners of the host  Alarm'd my troop I gather'd I pursu'd  Am come to save thee nor one hour withhold  The full protection of my nuptial hand  Th' illustrious virgin answer'd in a figh  O Alexander I am thine thou mine  By sacred vows yet thou a foe to Greece  Then Artemisia Noble maid I praise  That zeal for Greece thy country but forbear  At this momentous crisis to combine  Thy preservation with a public care  Thou need'st protection both of rank and pow'r  Few can resist the lustre of thy form  Which left unguarded thro' the lawless course  Of war might light in others less deprav'd  Than foul Argestes and his barb'rous son  New flames to burst in violence again  She ceases Timon ratifies her words  A mother's office now the queen performs  In preparation for connubial rites  Nor old Aronces nor th' acknowledg'd heir  Of Lygdamis are slow With human blood  Impure the streets are cleans'd the slain remov'd  Flow'rs pluck'd for chaplets nuptial torches burn  The altars smoke with odours sternest hearts  Grow mild Bellona's furies sleep forgot  Her fifes and clarions soften to delight  The ear of Hymen joy concludes the day  End of the Eighth Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the NINTH  SOFT rose the morn and still the azure flood  In gentle volumes undisturb'd with tides  But heav'd by zephyrs glaz'd the pebbled shore  When Caria's princess visiting the beach  With Haliartus and her son belov'd  Her bosom thus disclos'd O brother friend  In danger tried not yet are Asia's woes  Complete to Greece new trophies I forbode  Oh soon transported o'er these hostile waves  May Artemisia rest her wearied head  At length in peace and thou so late redeem'd  With her partake the blessing Ah thy looks  Reject the profferyet some rev'rence bear  To Artemisia some fraternal love  How shall I plead will haughty Greece admit  Thee to her honours thee in humblest state  Tho' meriting the highest known so long  Halicarnassus an illustrious town  Among her noblest citizens will rank  The son avow'd of Lygdamis O cast  A kindred eye on this my orphan boy  Who must become his

promise to redeem my head  Exchang'd for splendid captives by his arm  In fight acquir'd I hourly watch to hail  His peaceful mast perhaps yon distant keel  Contains his person To forsake this friend  Whose kindness bless'd my former humble state  Friend of my childhood youth and ripen'd years  Would be an act O thou of purest fame  To plunge thy brother in the lowest depth  Of human baseness baseness of the mind  Thy longlost brother found too soon a stain  To Lygdamis and thee Concluding here  He eyes the vessel bounding to the port  With branches green of olive on her head  Her poop and mast the Carian sailors hail  The fair pacific signal On the beach  The warrior leaps when Haliartus cries  I see my patron with expanded arms  Flies to embrace him Medon stops and speaks  In splendid mail is Meliboeus cas'd  Are these not Persian standards flying round  Art thou enroll'd an enemy to Greece  No interpos'd the queen behold him free  To thee to Greece unchang'd in arms my gift  He is my brother brother to the queen  Of Caria Medon here Immortal pow'rs  Do I survey the wonder of her sex  That heroine of Asia who alone  While now the fate of empire balanc'd hangs  Contributes virtue to the Persian scale  My friend to such a sister I resign  Ah never never Haliartus cried  Shalt thou resign me nor th' Oïlean house  Will I forsake in that belov'd abode  I was too happy for aspiring thoughts  First to redeem thy Locris I devote  These arms will perish there before thy foes  If such my fate if victor in thy ranks  Hang in thy mansion my reposing shield  There make my home Yet often will I court  Thy welcome princess on the Carian shore  To worship still thy virtue on thy son  Still pour the blessings of parental love  The Carian queen subjoins I must approve  To such clear honour yield bring Timon call  The king Time presses we must all depart  A sacred Delphian too from bondage freed  Thou shalt receive O Medon Swift the chief  To disembark his captives gave command  Five was their number one beyond the rest  In stature tower'd his armour was unspoil'd  Though rich in burnish'd gold emboss'd with gems  Of starry light his dignity and form  The victors rev'renc'd Medon to the queen  These Aristides at my efforts pleas'd  Gave to my choice from numbers an exchange  For Meliboeus and the Delphian priest  These I design'd my friends thy bounty frees  Take these unransom'd from a grateful hand  O lib'ral man the Carian princess here  Thou dost produce Masistius virtuous lord  How will Mardonius in thy sight rejoice  How lift his hopes To her Masistius bow'd  To Medon spake O Grecian if a thought  To die thy debtor could debase my soul  I should deserve till death all human woes  Demand obtain to Asia I am dear  Lov'd by Mardonius honour'd by the king  I cannot ask what either would refuse  To him who gave me liberty and life  Thou canst rejoins the chief obtain a grace  To me of precious worth to Xerxes none  Nor golden stores nor gems attract my eye  I have a sister dearer than the mines  Of Ind or wealth of Susa who resides  A priestess pure on that Oetaean ridge  Which overlooks Thermopylae her name  Melissa there an ancient fane is plac'd  No splendid seat oracular enrich'd  By proud donations but a mossy pile  Where ev'ry Grecian hath from age to age  Ador'd the muses Lift thy hand to swear  Thou wilt implore of Xerxes a decree  Irrevocable like a Median law  Forbidding all to climb that holy crag  To him Masistius Not the Delian isle  By Persians held inviolate of old  Shall boast of safety like Melissa's hill  For my performance lo I lift my hand  To Horomazes Thou return'd salute  Athenian Aristides in my name  From me his captive in that direful hour  Of carnage round Psyttalia's bloody strand  Say that my thankful tongue will never cease  Extolling his beneficence and thine  To him far more than liberty and life  I owe in bondage precious were the hours  With him the hours of converse who enlarg'd  Illum'd my heart and mind his captive freed  I go a wiser and a better man  Now with his consort Macedonia's king  And Timon were in sight a sad'ning look  Fair Amarantha mute on Timon fix'd  On her the father We must part he said  Alas too many of thy father's days  Captivity hath wasted sorrow more  Deploring thee my child while other Greeks  Erecting brilliant trophies have obtain'd  Eternal praise Thee Amarantha found  Thee wedded happy in thy choice and mine  I quit my tarnish'd honours to retrieve  She then In him a husband I avow  Felicity unstain'd in him ally  To Persia's tyrant I am left unbless'd  Malignant fortune still pursues thy child  Before me holds a consort and a sire  In adverse ranks contending He rejoins  I know thee daughter like the manliest Greek  The wrongs of Greece resenting but thy heart  Keep in subjection to a tender spouse  Of constancy approv'd whose house with mine  From eldest times by mutual tokens pass'd  In sacred hospitality is link'd  Thy pow'r of beauty never for thyself  Employ be all compliance use that charm  As kind occasion whispers in behalf  Of Greece alone by counsel sweetly breath'd  Diffuse remembrance of his Grecian blood  Thro' Alexander's heart While these converse  Apart the keels are launch'd now all embark  Aboard his vessel Medon leads the son  Of Lygdamis with Timon on her own  Imperial deck th' attentive queen dispos'd  The Macedonian with his beauteous bride  And Persians freed by Medon chief of these  Masistius merits her peculiar care  Confin'd Argestes trembles at his doom  From Xerxes' ire Along thy rocky verge  Thermopylae with sails and shrouds relax'd  Smooth glide the Carian gallies thro' a calm  Which o'er the Malian surface sleeps unmov'd  Unless by measur'd strokes of sounding oars  Or foambesilver'd prows A royal guard  Preceding Xerxes through that dreaded pass  Were then advancing not in order'd pomp  As on his march to Athens now behind  The regal chariot panic fear impell'd  On its encumber'd wheels disorder'd throngs  As if Leonidas had ris'n and shook  The snaky shield of Gorgon or his sword  Stain'd with Psyttalian havoc o'er their heads  The living arm of Aristides wav'd  On sight of Oeta Carian's queen relates  To her illustrious passengers the deeds  Which signaliz'd that rock nor leaves untold  The fate of Teribazus nor the wound  Of Ariana victims both to love  Now where Spercheos from his spumy jaws  A tribute large delivers to the bay  They land Mardonius passing tow'rds a tent  Magnificent erected for the king  Arriv'd but newly on his way perceives  Masistius transport locks his tongue he flies  Hangs on his friend unutterable joy  His tears alone discover More compos'd  Though not less cordial with a close embrace  First spake the late redeem'd Receive thy friend  Whom wreck'd and captive on Psyttalia's isle  An Attic leader Aristides nam'd  Restores unspoil'd unransom'd undisgrac'd  Mardonius quick Thy unexpected sight  By an Athenian all unsought restor'd  Presages all the good my warmest hopes  Could e'er suggest the omen I enjoy  For this shall Athens to my friendship won  Possess her laws her freedom with increase  Of rich dominion Artemisia then  Behold the king of Macedon his wife  In Amarantha Wond'ring at her form  Exclaims the Persian hero of one crime  I now acquit Argestes and his son  What ice of virtue could resist that face  Again the queen For other crimes my ship  Detains Argestes him before the king  To charge immediate audience we demand  Mardonius guides them to the royal tent  With half his chiefs the monarch anxious sat  His swift departure by the break of dawn  Arranging Amarantha in her shape  A deity among them sudden spreads  A blaze of beauty like the sun at noon  In dazzling state amidst an ether blue  Of torrid climates admiration loud  Wounds her offended ear She thus began  What you admire ye Persians O that Heav'n  Had ne'er conferr'd the cause of woe to me  Of guilt in others then a maiden hand  Had ne'er been dipp'd in slaughter nor these eyes  Survey'd the pavement of Nicaea strewn  With subjects made rebellious by my fate  Thy subjects monarch With a Caspian troop  Argestes forc'd thy castle me to seize  Th' affianc'd bride of Macedonia's king  Me to Sandauce giv'n a royal boon  Me then in freedom by the gracious will  Of thy imperial sister Help unhop'd  From Artemisia from my husband came  Me they preserv'd Argestes pris'ner bring  To undergo thy justice Caria's queen  With Macedon's indignant prince confirm  This accusation On his own retreat  Secure to Susa Xerxes all intent  Turns to Mardonius thou be judge he said  Take to thyself the forfeits of this crime  The king commands his servant shall be judge  Mardonius answer'd chief among my foes  Hath been Argestes therefore must not die  By my decree Let Cyra fort remote  On Iaxartes hide his banish'd head  That care to Artemisia I commit  His satrapy his treasure and domain  To Artamanes his remaining son  Thy meritorious vassal I ordain  This judgment pass'd a murmur nigh the tent  Denouncing an ambassador is heard  Ambassador of Sparta Soon appears  The manly frame of Aemnestus bold  Surpassing all his countrymen in arms  An Ephorus in office function high  Whose jealous vigilance imprison'd kings  Unjust or impious or assuming pow'r  Unwarranted by laws No train attends  He asks for Xerxes when Mardonius stern  Before the future sov'reign of the world  With princes round him single dost thou bring  An embassy from Sparta Spartans hold  One man with one sufficient in discourse  Cry'd Aemnestus Xerxes interpos'd  Reveal thy errand stranger He reply'd  Admonish'd by an oracle the state  Of Lacedaemon and the race divine  There dwelling sprung from Hercules demand  Of thee atonement for a slaughter'd king  Leonidas whom multitude oppress'd  While he defended Greece whate'er thou giv'st  I will accept The monarch to his cheek  A shew of laughter calls awhile is mute  Then breaking silence to Mardonius points  They shall receive th' atonement they deserve  From him Thou hear'st Mardonius Then with looks  Of scorn and menace Yes the Spartan said  Thee I accept my victim to appease  Leonidas disdainful then his foot  He turns away nor fears th' unnumber'd guard  Meantime the royal progeny is brought  To Artemisia urgent time requires  Their Father's fears the embarkation press  For Ephesus that night Them down the beach  Mardonius follows and the Carian queen  In secret thus addresses Didst thou mark  That Spartan's threat'ning words and haughty mien  An oracle suggested this demand  Strange and mysterious On the martial field  Him I can single from Laconian ranks  Audacious challenger but something more  Behind the veil of destiny may lurk  Unseen by me Mardonius she replied  Look only where no mystery can lurk  On ev'ry manly duty nothing dark  O'ershades the track of virtue plain her path  But superstition chosen for a guide  Misleads the best and wisest Think no more  Of this an object like that passing cloud  Before the moon who shortly will unfold  Her wonted brightness Prudent thy design  To gain th' Athenians to that noble race  Be large in proffers in performance true  Purchase but their neutrality thy sword  Will in despight of oracles reduce  The rest of Greece This utter'd she embarks  He seeks his tent and finds Masistius there  Whose honour mindful of a promise pledg'd  Requests protection for Melissa's fane  Him in his arms the son of Gobrias clasp'd  Thus fervent answ'ring Xerxes will renew  His rapid march tomorrow pow'r supreme  He leaves with me which instant shall be urg'd  To render firm the promise of my friend  Now lend thy counsel on the copious roll  Of Asia's host assist me to select  The thirty myriads giv'n to my command  They sat till dayspring then the camp is mov'd  Then Amarantha from her husband's tent  Ascends a car and traverses the vale  By fluent crystal of Spercheos lav'd  To join Sandauce On her way she meets  Artuchus guardian of the Persian fair  The satrap gazes courtesy entranc'd  Forgets awhile her function Thus at length  He greets the queen Fair stranger who dost rise  A second dayspring to th' astonish'd eye  Accept my service whither tends thy course  Whom dost thou seek and gracious tell thy name  In rosy blushes like Aurora still  She graceful thus Of Macedonia's king  I am th' espous'd my patroness I seek  Sandauce issue of th' imperial house  Artuchus answer'd Yesternoon beheld  Her languid steps approach this vale of woe  Thou beauteous princess to Sandauce known  Thou must have heard of Ariana's fate  Sandauce now is mourning at her tomb  A grave preparing for Autarctus slain  Mayst thou suspend despair Not distant flows  The fount of sorrow so we styl'd the place  Frequented oft by Ariana's grief  There oft her head disconsolate she hung  To feed incessant anguish ne'er disclos'd  Unless in sighing whispers to the stream  Her last abode is there The myrtles shed  Their odours round the virgin roses bloom  I there have caus'd a monument to rise  That passing strangers may her name revere  And weep her fortune from her early grave  May learn how Heav'n is jealous of its boons  Not long to flourish where they most excel  A marble mansion new erected nigh  Her faithful slaves inhabit who attune  To thrilling lutes a daily fun'ral song  He leads he stops On gentlymoving air  Sweet measures glide this melancholy dirge  To melting chords by sorrow touch'd is heard  Cropp'd is the rose of beauty in her bud  Bright virtue's purest mansion is defac'd  Like Mithra's beams her silken tresses shone  In lustre gentle as a vernal morn  Her eye reveal'd the beauties of her mind  The slave the captive in her light rejoic'd  Lament ye daughters of Choaspes wail  Ye Cissian maids your paragon is lost  Once like the freshblown lily in the vale  In Susa fair in radiancy of bloom  Like summer glowing till consuming love  Deform'd her graces then her hue she chang'd  To lilies pining in decay but kept  The smile of kindness on her wasted cheek  Lament ye daughters of Choaspes wail  Ye Cissian maids your paragon is lost  O ray of wisdom eye of virtue form'd  To spread superior light the dazzling brand  Of love malign obscur'd thy eagle sight  Thy vital flames are vanish'd ours remain  As lamps to endless mourning in thy tomb  Till we rejoin thee in a land of bliss  Lament ye daughters of Choaspes wail  Ye Cissian maids your paragon is lost  The song concludes Sandauce from a bank  Of turf uprises resting on her slaves  A pallid visage and a fainting step  She brings before the sepulchre and spake  O Ariana listen from thy tomb  To me in woe thy sister as in blood  By diff'rent fortunes both were doom'd to waste  An early bloom in sorrow O admit  Autarctus first a neighbour to thy clay  Me next who feel my vital thread unwind  O Heav'n my humble spirit would submit  To thy afflicting handbut ev'ry fount  Of health is dry'd my frame enfeebled sinks  Beneath its trial When the inhuman priest  Condemn'd my children to his cruel knife  The freezing sheers of fate that moment cut  My heartstrings never have they heal'd again  Decay'd and wither'd in the flower of life  My strength deserts my patience tender friends  Provide another graveFor whom bursts forth  Emathia's queen and threw her clasping arms  Around the princess whose discolour'd hue  In warm affection flushes at the sight  Of Amarantha as a languid rose  Shrunk by the rigour of nocturnal frosts  A while reviving at the tepid rays  Of wintry Phoebus glows For me she sigh'd  For me that bed of endless rest is made  Com'st thou neglectful of thy nuptial bliss  To poor Sandauce's burial soon the hour  When of the sun these sickly eyes must take  Their last farewel may call thy friendly hand  To close their curtains in eternal night  These words the Grecian fair in sorrow try'd  In constancy unshaken swift return'd  Thou shalt not die avoid this mournful spot  Thou hast accomplish'd all thy duty here  Let other duties wak'ning in thy breast  Strive with despair transported in my arms  To Alexander's capital resort  Thou shalt not die returning health allur'd  By Amarantha's love and tender care  Again shall bless her patroness renew  Her youth in bloom in vigour ne'er to leave  Her infants doubly orphans At their name  The princess faints too sensitive a plant  Which on the lightest touch contracts the leaves  And seems to wither in the fold of death  Her lovely weight Artuchus to his tent  Conveys a litter gentle as it moves  Receives her soon her children by her side  In Macedonian chariots are dispos'd  Her female slaves and eunuchs Now appears  Emathia's prince to guard his matchless bride  In arms complete resembling Mars he rules  The fiery courser Artamanes swift  This royal mandate to Artuchus bears  The king O satrap hath begun his march  Delay not thine with all thy precious charge  To Artamanes then the Grecian queen  Let me request thee in Sandauce's name  To visit yonder fount of sorrow call'd  There see th' unfinish'd obsequies perform'd  To great Autarctus due Her languid head  With me a while at Aegae will repose  My consort's royal seat and gentle youth  If justice whisper to thy feeling heart  That well I sav'd my innocence and fame  Thou wilt be welcome to the Aegaean hall  This said she mounts her chariot not unpleas'd  He to accomplish her command proceeds  Artuchus now conducts the female train  Unhappy victims of ambition These  A prey to famine to congealing blasts  From cold Olympus from Bisaltio hills  And Rhodope snowvested were condemn'd  With that innumerable host in flight  Unform'd unfurnish'd scatter'd to partake  Of miseries surpassing nature's help  On earth's unwholsome lap their tender limbs  To couch to feed on grass on bitter leaves  On noisome bark of trees and swell the scene  Between Spercheos and the distant shores  Of Hellespontine Sestos real scene  Of death beyond the massacre denounc'd  By that stern angel in the prophet's dream  When were assembled ev'ry fowl of prey  From all the regions of the peopled air  At Heav'ns dread call to banquet on the flesh  Of princes captains and of mighty men  End of the Eighth Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the TENTH  NOW is the season when Vertumnus leads  Pomona's glowing charms through ripen'd groves  Of ruddy fruitage now the loaden vine  Invites the gath'ring hand which treasures joy  For hoary winter in his turn to smile  An eastern course before autumnal gales  To Ephesus the Carian gallies bend  While Medon coasts

Pluto's vale  Receiv'd his brother Pollux who from Jove  Deriv'd immortal left the realms of day  And half his own divinity resign'd  His dearlov'd Castor to redeem from death  So rush'd Leonteus into

still  May bless the gods by your auspicious aid  Beyond my hopes discover'd I may bring  No feeble standard to the Grecian camp  When Athens now triumphant o'er the waves  With her deep phalanx in the field completes  The overthrow of Asia and restores  Dejected Locris So to Israel's sons  Their little ones and wives by deathful thirst  Amid the parching wilderness oppress'd  Their legislator

Calauria first  We interchang'd embraces now accept  A salutation doubly warm O chief  By Aristides pris'd his second bold  In high exploits which signalize an isle  Obscure before Psyttalia be my guest  This night at least He said they pass'd aboard  With Haliartus and the Delphian seer  A gen'rous meal concluded Medon spake  Troezenian chief now give the mind repast  I have been absent long when first the flight  Of Asia's host and shatter'd fleet was known  From Salamis I hoisted sail To hear  Of Aristides and the laurell'd son  Of Neocles to hear of all the brave  Whose high achievements consecrate that day  From thy narration would delight my soul  Cleander then began To council call'd  By Eurybiades the leading Greeks  A while debated if their fleet combin'd  Should sail to break the Hellespontine bridge  This he oppos'd I readily had join'd  Th' Athenian people eager by themselves  Without auxiliar Grecians to pursue  The arrogant invader but the tribes  In form assembled with dissuasive words  Themistocles thus cool'd I oft have seen  Have oftner heard that vanquish'd men constrain'd  By desperation have their loss repair'd  In fight renew'd Repelling such a cloud  Of enemies from Greece contented rest  The pow'r of gods and heroes not our own  Achiev'd the deed pursue not those who fly  Resort to Athens in their old abodes  Replace your women such obsequious wives  Such daughters reinstate your native walls  Rebuild your ruin'd mansions sow your fields  Prevent a dearth by early spring unfurl  Your active sails then shake the eastern shores  He last propos'd that exiles be recall'd  Loud acclamations rose the honour'd name  Of Aristides thunder'd on the beach  O wise Athenians Medon cordial here  O happy man whose happiness is plac'd  In virtuous actions happiest now a scope  Is giv'n unbounded to thy hand and heart  Proceed Cleander He his tale renews  Th' Athenians launch their gallies all embark  With Aristides chosen to that charge  I set my ready canvass to perform  The last kind office from Calauria's isle  And Troezen's walls to waft their wives and race  Left in our trust Meantime the diff'rent chiefs  Meet on the isthmus summon'd to decide  Who best had serv'd the public who might claim  The highest honours Every leader names  Himself the first but all concurrent own  Themistocles the second Envy still  Prevails without decision they disperse  Each to his home Themistocles incens'd  In eager quest of honours justly due  Withheld unjustly not to Athens bends  His hast'ning step but Sparta Medon here  Not so would Aristidesbut forgive  My interrupting voice The youth pursues  In Athens him I join'd a people found  Whom fortune never by her frown depress'd  Nor satisfied with favour Active all  Laborious cheerful they persist in toil  To heave the hills of ruin from their streets  Without repining at their present loss  Intent on future greatness to be rais'd  On persevering fortitude The word  Of Aristides guides Amidst a scene  Of desolation decency provides  The fun'ral pomp for those illustrious slain  At Salamis th' insculptur'd tomb I saw  Preparing they already have ordain'd  A distant day to solemnize the rites  The mouth of Aristides they decree  To celebrate the valiant who have died  For Athens While Themistocles accepts  A foreign praise in Sparta olive crowns  A car selected from the public store  A guard three hundred citizens highrank'd  Him through their tracts are chosen to attend  Excess of rev'rence by that rigid state  Ne'er shewn before To small Troezene's walls  Tomorrow I return with less renown  With less desert perhaps to purer bliss  My Ariphilia calls her soldier home  To give her nuptial hand My welcome guest  You I invite the season rude of Mars  Is clos'd new combats will the spring supply  Th' autumnal remnant winter hov'ring near  Let us possess in peace Then Timon spake  Young chief I praise thee be a husband soon  Be soon a parent thou wilt bear thy shield  With constancy redoubled If defence  Of our forefathers sleeping in their tombs  So oft unsheaths our swords more strongly sure  Th' endearing living objects of our love  Must animate the gen'rous good and brave  I am unworthy of that praise in smiles  Subjoins the Locrian but thou know'st my friend  I have a brother of a copious stream  The source he call'd to battle shall maintain  Oïlean fame Cleander I am bound  To Lacedaemon treasure there I left  Which well exchang'd for nature's foodful gifts  I would transport to Atalanté's shore  Seat of that brother who Leonteus nam'd  With brave companions there in refuge lies  A future aid to Greece A list'ning ear  Cleander yields while Medon's lips unwind  The varied series of events befall'n  Himself and Timon Amarantha fair  The Carian queen and Meliboeus chang'd  To Haliartus By th' immortal gods  We will not sep'rate fervent cries the youth  My Ariphilia who is wise and good  Will entertain society like yours  As Aethiopia in Maeonian song  Receives to pure and hospitable roofs  Her visitants from heav'n Let youth advise  Not inexperienc'd but o'er land and sea  To early action train'd retaining all  Your narrative heartpiercing I perceive  Your wants and feel impatience to befriend  My lightest keel to Salamis shall bear  Thy orders Timon for the Delphian barks  There left behind you in Troezene's port  To join you straight His counsel they accept  The moon is rising Salamis not far  The will of Timon to his Delphian train  Is swiftly borne The squadron next proceeds  Passing Troezene by whose gen'rous chief  Accompanies to shore his Locrian guest  At Cynosura Spartan is this port  He said with fifty followers speed thy way  Commit no treasure to the faithless winds  By land return to find thy ready barks  Wellfill'd from Troezen's stores They part he sails  To joyful welcome on his native shores  When now unveiling slowly as she rolls  Her brother's light the moon reflected full  Auspicious period for connubial rites  From Lacedaemon hast'ning Medon gains  Troezene's ramparts him Cleander chose  His paranymph to lead the bridal steps  Of Ariphilia To Calauria's verge  He pass'd beneath a nuptial chaplet gay  He wore his crisped hair of purest white  A tunic wrapp'd his sinewy chest and loins  A glowing mantle new in Tyrian dye  Fell down his shoulders Up the shelving lawn  The high Neptunian structure he attains  Where with her parents Ariphilia waits  Attir'd in roses like her hue herself  As Flora fair or Venus at her birth  When from the ocean with unrifl'd charms  The virgin goddess sprung Yet far unlike  A maid sequester'd from the public eye  She early train'd in dignity and state  In sanctity of manners to attract  A nation's rev'rence to th' advancing chief  In sweet composure unreluctant yields  Her bridal hand who down the vaulted isle  Where echo joins the hymeneal song  Conducts the fair before the costly shrine  Perfum'd with incense and with garlands deck'd  Presents her charms and thus in manly pray'r  My patron god from Salamis I come  One of thy naval sons erecting there  Thy recent trophies let me hence convey  With thy concurrent smile this precious prize  Thy sacerdotal virgin I return  To thee a pious votary to her  A constant lover on thy servants pour  Thy nuptial blessing Yet earthshaking god  Not bound in sloth thy warrior shall repose  Nor languishing obscure in sweetest bliss  Desert thy glory Soon as wintry storms  Thy nod controls and vernal breezes court  The unfurling canvass my unweary'd helm  Shall cleave thy floods till each Barbarian coast  Acknowledge thy supremacy and bow  To Grecian Neptune Credulous the train  Surrounding in religious rapture see  The colossean image of their god  Smile on their hero meriting the smiles  Of deities and mortals Fortune adds  Her casual favour on Cleander's mast  To perch a pair of turtle doves she sends  From Neptune's temple To his vessel crown'd  With Hymen's wreaths bestrewn with herbs and flow'rs  Exhaling fragrance down the slope he guides  His Ariphilia priestess now no more  So Hermes guardian of the Graces leads  Their chief Aglaia o'er th' Olympian hall  Warn'd by the muses in preluding strains  The dance on heav'n's bright pavement to begin  And charm the festive gods The flood repass'd  They as Troezenian institutes require  The fane of young Hippolytus approach  That victim pure to chastity who left  Old Theseus childless From the youthful heads  Of both their hair is sever'd on his shrine  Their maiden off'ring laid They next ascend  An awful structure sacred to the Fates  There grateful own that goodness which decreed  Their happy union To the Graces last  Their vows are paid divinities benign  Whom Ariphilia fervent thus invokes  O goddesses who all its sweetness shed  On human life whate'er is beauteous here  Illustrious happy to your favour owes  Its whole endearment wanting you our deeds  Are cold and joyless In my husband's eye  Preserve me lovely not in form alone  But that supreme of graces in my sex  Complacency of love She pray'd her look  Reveal'd that heav'n would ratify her pray'r  Now in her father's dwelling they remain  Till dusky ev'ning On a bridal car  Constructed rich the paranymph then seats  The blooming fair one side Cleander fills  The other Medon she between them rides  By torches clear preceded Lively sounds  The ceremonial music soon they reach  The bridegroom's mansion there a feast receives  Unnumber'd friends the nuptial dance and song  Are now concluded To her fragrant couch  A joyful mother lights the blushing bride  Cleander follows in the chamber shut  He leaves the guests exulting to revive  Their song to Hymen and renew the dance  Three days succeeding were to gymnic feats  Devoted Medon's warlike spear obtains  A second chaplet Haliartus won  The wrestler's prize to hurl the massy disk  None match'd the skill of Timon still robust  Tho' rev'rend threads of silver had begun  To streak his locks of sable Southern gales  Now call on Medon's laden fleet to sail  Ere winter frowns With Timon at his side  And Haliartus in this gentle phrase  His noble host and hostess fair he greets  May ev'ry joy kind wishes can devise  Or language utter hospitable pair  Be yours for ever may a num'rous race  In virtue grow by your parental care  With sev'n dear pledges of connubial love  I left a brother watching my return  In Atalanté small exhausted isle  Which needs my instant succour Gen'rous friend  To thee I trust my treasure thou discharge  The claim of Troezen for th' abundant stores  Which load our vessels for a time farewell  The vernal sun will see our love renew'd  And swords combin'd against Mardonius bold  He said the lovely Ariphilia weeps  Cleander sighs but speeds his parting guests  End of the Tenth Book
