ADVERTISEMENT  THAT this Poem is authentic we have the best Authority That it has high Merit no one will doubt who has the smallest Pretension to Taste It has all the Enthusiasm and poetic Colouring

 Tobiae Smollet Scoti  Qui prosapia generosa et antiqua natus  Priscae virtutis exemplar emicuit  Aspectu ingenuo  Corpore valido  Pectore animoso  Indole apprime benigna  Et fere supra facultates munifica  Insignis  Ingenio feraci faceto versatili  Omnigenae fere doctrinae mire capaci  Varia fabularum dulcedine  Vitam moresque hominum  Ubertate summa ludens depinxit  Adverso interim nefas tali tantoque alumno  Nisi quo satyrae opipare supplebat  Seculo impio ignavo fatuo  Quo musae vix nisi nothae  Mecaenatulis Britannicis  Fovebantur  In memoriam  Optimi et amabilis omnino viri  Permultis amicis desiderati  Hocce marmor  Dilectissima simul et amantissima conjux  L M  Sacravit  INDEPENDENCE AN ODE  STROPHE  THY Spirit INDEPENDENCE let me share  Lord of the LionHeart and EagleEye  Thy Steps I follow with my Bosom bare  Nor heed the Storm that howls along the Sky  Deep in the frozen Regions of the North  A Goddess violated brought thee forth  Immortal LIBERTY whose look sublime  Hath blanch'd the Tyrant's Cheek in every varying Clime  What Time the ironhearted Gaul  With frantic Superstition for his Guide  Armed with the Dagger and the Pall  The Sons of Woden to the Field defy'd  The ruthless Hag by Weser's flood  In Heaven's Name urg'd the infernal Blow  And red the Stream began to flow  The vanquish'd were baptiz'd with Blood  Baptiz'd with Blood  Charlemagne obliged Four Thousand Saxon Prisoners to embrace the Christian Religion and immediately after they were baptized ordered their Throats to be cut Their Prince Vitikind fled for Shelter to Gotrick King of Denmark    ANTISTROPHE  The Saxon Prince in Horror fled  From Altars stain'd with human Gore  And Liberty his routed Legions led  In Safety to the bleak Norwegian Shore  There in a Cave asleep she lay  Lull'd by the hoarseresounding Main  When a bold Savage past that Way  Impell'd by Destiny his Name  Disdain  Of ample Front the portly Chief appear'd  The hunted Bear supplied a shaggy Vest  The drifted Snow hung on his yellow Beard  And his broad Shoulders brav'd the furious Blast  He stopt he gazed his Bosom glow'd  And deeply felt th' Impression of her Charms  He seiz'd the Advantage Fate allow'd  And straight compress'd her in his vigorous Arms  STROPHE  The Curlieu screamed the Tritons blew  Their Shells to celebrate the ravish'd Rite  Old Time exulted as he flew  And INDEPENDENCE saw the Light  The Light he saw in Albion's happy Plains  Where under Cover of a flowering Thorn  While Philomel renew'd her warbled Strains  Th' auspicious Fruit of stol'n Embrace was born  The Mountain Dryads seiz'd with Joy  The smiling Infant to their Charge consign'd  The Doric Muse caress'd the favourite Boy  The Hermit  Wisdom  stor'd his opening Mind  As rolling Years matur'd his Age  He flourish'd bold and sinewy as his Sire  While the mild Passions in his Breast assuage  The fiercer Flames of his maternal Fire  ANTISTROPHE  Accomplish'd thus he wing'd his Way  And zealous rov'd from Pole to Pole  The Rolls of Right eternal to display  And warm with Patriot Thoughts the aspiring Soul  On desart Isles  On desart Isles  Although Venice was built a considerable Time before the Aera here assigned for the Birth of INDEPENDENCE the Republic had not yet attained to any great Degree of Power and Splendor  'twas he that rais'd  Those Spires that gild the Adriatic Wave  Where Tyranny beheld amaz'd  Fair Freedom's Temple where he mark'd her Grave  He steel'd the blunt Batavian's Arms  To burst the Iberian's double Chain  To burst the Iberian's double Chain  The Low Countries were not only oppressed by grievous Taxations but likewise threatened with the Establishment of the Inquisition when the Seven Provinces revolted and shook off the Yoke of Spain    And Cities rear'd and planted Farms  Won from the Skirts of Neptune's wide Domain  He with the generous Rustics sate  On Uri's Rocks in close Divan  On Uri's Rocks  Alluding to the known Story of William Tell and his Associates the Fathers and Founders of the Confederacy of the Swiss Cantons    And wing'd that Arrow sure as Fate  Which ascertain'd the sacred Rights of Man  STROPHE  Arabia's scorching Sands he crost  Arabia's scorching Sands  The Arabs rather than resign their Independency have often abandoned their Habitations and encountered all the Horrors of the Desart    Where blasted Nature pants supine  Conductor of her Tribes adust  To Freedom's adamantine Shrine  And many a Tartar Hord forlorn aghast  And many a Tartar Hord  From the Tyranny of JenghisKhan TimurBec and other eastern Conquerors whole Tribes of Tartars were used to fly into the remoter Wastes of Cathay where no Army could follow them    He snatch'd from under fell Oppression's Wing  And taught amidst the dreary Waste  Th' allchearing Hymns of Liberty to sing  He Virtue finds like precious Ore  Diffus'd through every baser Mould  Even now he stands on Calvi's rocky Shore  And turns the Dross of Corsica to Gold  And turns the Dross of Corsica  The noble Stand made by Paschal Paoli and his Associates against the Usurpation of the French King must endear them to all the Sons of Liberty and Independence    He Guardian Genius taught my Youth  Pomp's tinsel Livery to despise  My Lips by him chastis'd to Truth  Ne'er paid that Homage which the Heart denies  ANTISTROPHE  Those sculptur'd Halls my Feet shall never tread  Where varnish'd Vice and Vanity combin'd  To dazzle and seduce their Banners spread  And forge vile Shackles for the freeborn Mind  Where Insolence his wrinkled Front uprears  And all the Flowers of spurious Fancy blow  And Title his illwoven Chaplet wears  Full often wreath'd around the Miscreant's Brow  Wherever dimpling Falshood pert and vain  Presents her Cup of stale Profession's Froth  And pale Disease with all his bloated Train  Torments the Sons of Gluttony and Sloth  STROPHE  In Fortune's Car behold that Minion ride  With either India's glittering Spoils opprest  So moves the SumpterMule in harness'd Pride  That bears the Treasure which he cannot taste  For him let venal Bards disgrace the Bay  And hireling Minstrels wake the tinkling String  Her sensual Snares let faithless Pleasure lay  And all her gingling Bells fantastic Folly ring  Disquiet Doubt and Dread shall intervene  And Nature still to all her Feelings just  In Vengeance hang a damp on every Scene  Shook from the baleful Pinions of Disgust  ANTISTROPHE  Nature I'll court in her sequester'd Haunts  By Mountain Meadow Streamlet Grove or Cell  Where the pois'd Lark his Evening Ditty chaunts  And Health and Peace and Contemplation dwell  There Study shall with Solitude recline  And Friendship pledge me to his FellowSwains  And Toil and Temperance sedately twine  The slender chord that fluttering Life sustains  And fearless Poverty shall guard the Door  And Taste unspoil'd the frugal Table spread  And Industry supply the humble Store  And Sleep unbrib'd his Dews refreshing shed  Whitemantl'd Innocence etherial Spright  Shall chace far off the Goblins of the Night  And INDEPENDENCE o'er the Day preside  Propitious Power my Patron and my Pride  FINIS  BOOKS printed for J MURRAY
