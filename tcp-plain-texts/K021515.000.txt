 TIMANTHES A TRAGEDY  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  TIMANTHES A TRAGEDY  As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  BY JOHN HOOLE  LONDON Printed for T BECKET and Co in the Strand  MDCCLXX  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr BENSLEY  WHEN first our bard advent'rous left the shore  To tempt the drama's depth untry'd before  With beating heart his trembling sail he rear'd  While critic sands and envious rocks he fear'd  But your indulgence swell'd the prosp'rous wind  And sase convey'd him to the port design'd  The track yourselves approv'd he now pursues  And for a second trip his care renews  Oft in the silent hours of teeming thought  As flatt'ring prospects in his bosom wrought  Hope imag'd to his sight your starting tear  And brought the welcome plaudit to his ear  But while he now revolves that mutual fame  Should join the poet's and the actor's name  O let him here one tender tribute pay  To early worth untimely snatch'd away  To HIM who once alas his scene inspir'd  Whose softness melted and whose spirit fir'd  While to the friend this grateful debt he pays  Each gen'rous breast will sure confirm the praise  With you his honest zeal must stand approv'd  Which makes this off'ring to the man he lov'd  Dramatis Personae  DEMOPHOON  Mr BENSLEY  TIMANTHES  Mr SMITH  CHERINTHUS  Mr WROUGHTON  MATHUSIUS  Mr CLARKE  ADRASTUS  Mr GARDNER  ORCANES  Mr DAVIS  OLINTHUS a

ORCANES  TIMANTHES is arriv'd  ADRASTUS  The setting sun  Gilds his returning ensignsGreat Demophoon  Prepares to welcome home his conquering son  And meet him with a father's love  ORCANES  And yet  Amidst this hour of triumph sorrow clouds  The splendor of a victor's arms this eve  Foreruns a day of sad solemnity  ADRASTUS  Orcanes yesthat sun whose chearful light  Smiles on the harmless swain that piping leads  His flock to fold must ere tomorrow's noon  Behold his altar stain'd with guiltless blood  Thou know'st long since the oracle requir'd  A virgin's life in annual sacrifice  And every year on this returning day  In solemn rites our weeping Thrace gives up  The melancholy victim  ORCANES  Have the priests  Receiv'd the virgins yet whose names must stand  Tomorrow's dreadful chance  ADRASTUS  Not yetand thence  I fear new evils may arise 'tis whisper'd  I know not what of something that portends  Contest and tumult to the state Mathusius  The hoary chief beneath whose fostering care  Our young Timanthes learn'd the trade of war  Grown old in toils an alien to the court  Now lives sequester'd since the king displeas'd  Recall'd him from command and in his stead  Left his brave son to guide the Thracian files  Retir'd he dwells where on the city's skirts  The sea in tempests breaks or where in calms  Its glassy waves reflect the trembling towers  With him resides his daughter fair Ismena  ORCANES  The coldness 'twixt Demophoon and Mathusius  Has reach'd the public notice born to shine  In camps alone Mathusius has not learnt  The soft address to rise in courts  ADRASTUS  'Tis true  And bred with him Timanthes has imbib'd  His temper's warmth which oft by youth inflam'd  Flies to extremesCherinthus his young brother  Is form'd of softer mould yet both possess  Demophoon's heart and born of different queens  He in Timanthes seems to prize the gifts  Of manly fortitude while in Cherinthus  He loves the milder virtues that revive  His queen Serena's memory  ORCANES  Cherinthus  Is now expected from the Phrygian land  Sent by Demophoon on some embassy  Of high concernbut see the king approaches  Enter  DEMOPHOON  attended  DEMOPHOON  'Tis wellMathusius' absence on the eve  Of this important day when he should meet  My conquering son the pupil of his arms  Argues a stubbornness and disregard  A sovereign ill can brook we own his deeds  His years of service for the statebut tell  The allpresuming man that merit self  O'errated cancels its rewardAdrastus  Ought hears't thou of Cherinthus  ADRASTUS  No my liege  But to the Thracian port the fav'ring winds  Must bring his vessel ere the close of eve  Forgive a subject's freedom but you seem  Oppress'd with secret care  DEMOPHOON  The time Adrastus  Now calls for meditation and how few  Are a king's hours of peace whose every day  Teems with some counsel for the public weal  ADRASTUS  Yet this auspicious day my king must own  Sets not with common lustre when your son  The brave Timanthes from the Scythian land  Adds to his father's brow new wreaths of fame  And to his people gives the palms of peace  No sacred sir the hardy sons of Thrace  Did never celebrate with greater joy  A conquering chief's return  DEMOPHOON  Well pleas'd I hear  My faithful people's shouts ascend the sky  And sympathize in those exulting sounds  That to the muchlov'd name of my Timanthes  Join every wishbut hark the victor comes  Enter  TIMANTHES  attended  TIMANTHES  Royal sir  To whom Timanthes owns the double tie  Of son and subject see him now return'd  From Scythia's kingdom with success and conquest  To grace a father's throne  DEMOPHOON  Timanthes rise  The king and father give thee double welcome  And treble praise to Mars the armipotent  That gives Demophoon in his darling son  His kingdom's best defender  TIMANTHES  Thanks to heaven  Whose smiles have grac'd my unexperienc'd arms  I may without a blush confess my deeds  Yes we have conquer'd never view'd the sun  A more extensive slaughter 'midst the tumult  Of fear and rage were blended undistinguish'd  The brave the base the victor and the vanquish'd  The day at length was ours if you demand  A proof of this behold yon' captive bands  Behold yon' shatter'd arms and streaming ensigns  DEMOPHOON  'Tis not alone o'er the stern Scythian foe  Thou spread'st thy trophies by subduing him  Thou triumph'st in Demophoon's breastmeantime  In this embrace receive my pledge of love  Thy father welcomes theeproceed my son  Urge on thy course to honour's furthest goal  Till verging on the extreme of age Demophoon  Beholds thy fame eclipse his ownbut toils  Demand refreshment and the weary'd arm  Of valour gains new vigour from repose  But I have that requires thy private ear  Let all except Timanthes leave the presence  Exeunt attendants  Manent  DEMOPHOON  and  TIMANTHES  DEMOPHOON  Come near my sonthou little think'st how much  Thy happiness employs my careful breast  While in the distant fields of fame Timanthes  Encounter'd dangers for his father's honour  Demophoon's thoughts were all employ'd at home  To bless his glad return with halcyon days  TIMANTHES  Have I not felt your goodness since the time  Of early childhood to the ripening age  Of manly life a father has prevented  My every wish  DEMOPHOON  Thou know'st Argea dy'd  Ere twice six moons had taught thy tongue to lisp  A mother's nametwo years elaps'd once more  I try'd the nuptial band Cherinthus crown'd  This second unionbut his birth alas  Was fatal to Serena and with her  In me the husband dy'd and now the father  Engrosses all my soul  TIMANTHES  Still may Timanthes  With filial duty sooth your days in peace  And oft as war shall call your banners forth  Return with conquest home  DEMOPHOON  Thou canst not tell  How dear I hold theeto the toil of arms  Love gives its soft relief and beauty best  Smooths the rough front of war tho' now my years  Roll forward and the summer of my life  Yields to declining autumn well I know  What youth has been and what befits the age  When jocund spring leads up the laughing hours  TIMANTHES  Alas my lord let not your goodness task  Timanthes' gratitude I ask no more  To crown my labours than Demophoon's smiles  What bliss is wanting to that chief whose arms  Defend his sovereign's crown and guard his people  DEMOPHOON  Yes my lov'd son Cephisa's virgin charms  Cephisa daughter to the Phrygian king  Shall be thy valour's great reward  TIMANTHES  Cephisa  DEMOPHOON  What mean'st thou Wherefore hangs this sudden gloom  O'er thy chang'd features Can Cephisa's beauties  Whom sighing kingsnay more  TIMANTHES  Yet hear me sir  Be not displeas'd with your TimanthesHeav'n's  My witness gladly would I yield my life  If such a sacrifice could aught avail  To insure Demophoon's peacebut I confess  Repugnance here  DEMOPHOON  Timanthes  TIMANTHES  Tho' I own  What fame has loudly spoken every virtue  That decks the royal virgin yet if aught  My deeds have merited  DEMOPHOON  Where can we find  Another partner for Timanthes' bed  Unless a subject bornThink not my son  The shades of our great ancestors shall blush  To see their line disgrac'dfrom them we hold  The statute that condemns to death the subject  Who weds with royal blood and whilst I live  I'm guardian of the laws and will enforce them  Even with severest rigour  TIMANTHES  Sacred sir  Enter  ORCANES  ORCANES  The Phrygian ships my lord are now descry'd  Full steering to the port their spreading sails  Swell in the winds that waft them to the shore  DEMOPHOON  'Tis wellgo thou my son to meet thy brother  And bid the princess welcome to the land  Myself would with thee but the priests demand  My presence at the temple to consult  Tomorrow's mournful rites  TIMANTHES  aside  Doubts rise on doubts  This dreadful sacrificeyet stay my father  DEMOPHOON  What would'st thouspeak  TIMANTHES  Alas I know not what  Fain would I utterbut  DEMOPHOON  No more I cannot  Prolong the precious time in vain debate  The terms are settled princethen summon all  Thy virtue to respect a parent's will  And dress thy looks in smiles to meet Cephisa  Exeunt  Demophoon  and  Orcanes▪  TIMANTHES  alone  Ha dress my looks in smiles to meet Cephisa  What have I heardO where's Ismena now  That once could sooth my cares whose beauty best  Smooth'd the rough task of warMethinks ev'n now  She chides the lingering hoursthen let me fly  Steal unperceiv'd upon the beauteous mourner  And with Timanthes' love relieve her sorrows  Exit  SCENE  A Garden  Enter  MATHUSIUS  and  ISMENA  ISMENA  Yet hear me sir nor chide your lov'd Ismena  If she presume with unexperienc'd counsel  To guide a father's thoughtsAlas I fear  The fond impatience of paternal tenderness  But makes that evil sure which fortune else  May otherwise disposeHas not Demophoon  Dispatch'd some delegates to Delphos' shrine  Once more to seek a period to the scourge  That hangs each year on our devoted Thrace  MATHUSIUS  From thence no comfort springsThis very morn  Arriv'd they from the sacred tripos brought  This doubtful answer that the land must groan  Beneath the wrath of heaven till to himself  Th' offender shall be known who guiltless now  Usurps a prince's right  ISMENA  Mysterious all  MATHUSIUS  Meantime destruction with remorseless fury  Hangs o'er my child the darling of my age▪  And shall I then consent  ISMENA  Yet recollect  Your wonted fortitudewhy should you hope  That 'midst the weeping maids of Thrace Ismena  Should stand exempted from the fatal urn  You plead the king perhaps  MATHUSIUS  And just the plea  Am I because a subject less a father  Apollo wills some virgin nobly born  Should stain his altar every year with blood  Let him recall his daughter kept at distance  With artful policylet him expose  Her name in yonder urn and let him prove  What pangs distract a wretched parent's breast  When his heart trembles as the priest draws near  The sacred vase while with a solemn mien  His lips prepare to speak the victim's name  ISMENA  Alas my lord cast round your eyes behold  The Thracian court and mark her proudest nobles  Whose hearts have shudder'd on this awful day  For a child's threaten'd life'tis true Arsene  The firstborn offspring of his queen Argea  Resides at distance from Demophoon's palace  But yet reflect that singly to refuse  Ismena's name will but incense the king  Let not my danger urge you to expose  Your age to further woetoo much already  He views you with an unpropitious eye  I dread to think if now too far provok'd  What mischief may ensue  MATHUSIUS  In vain thou tell'st me  Of wrath or hatred in his breast while reason  Asserts my cause and heav'n inspires my thoughts  Was it for this I taught his arms to conquer  And bred his son to greatness Yes by me  The Scythian foe is vanquish'd and by me  This eve Timanthes comes in triumph home▪  ISMENA  Timanthes O my heart  aside  What says my father  Is then the prince return'd  MATHUSIUS  He is Ismena  And comes in happy hour his generous soul  Disdains not to remember that Mathusius  Taught his young sword to reap in glory's field▪  To him I will appealhe will with pity  Behold a parent's sufferings  ISMENA  Yet my father  Should the brave prince with sympathizing heart  Plead vainly with Demophoon O forbear  To urge the contest further hope the genius  That still has watch'd your years of danger past  Will guard your age from anguish  MATHUSIUS  Cease Ismena  To oppose with fruitless words my fix'd resolve  No if I still must be condemn'd to feel  This anguish of the soul yon haughty monarch  Shall share with me those fears a father knows  Nor stand excluded from Mathusius' pangs  Exit  ISMENA  alone  The tempest thickens round my little bark  That till this hour has stemm'd life's boisterous wave  At length I fear must sinkTimanthes comes  He comes with conquest crown'd but where are now  Ismena's smiles to meet him Is it thus  With tears illomen'd with foreboding sighs  I give him welcome here  Enter  TIMANTHES  My life my lord  Com'st thou again preserv'd from danger's field  To these fond arms  TIMANTHES  Yes 'midst the sterner deeds  Which glory claim'd thy image present still  Sooth'd every toilAnd art thou then the same  As when I left thee at the call of honour  ISMENA  Canst thou then doubt me If thy heart Timanthes  In the rough shock of war and clang of arms  Forgot not softer hours of peace and love  Think'st thou Ismena 'midst these shades that oft  Have witness'd to our mutual vows would ever  Cast off remembrance that she once was happy  TIMANTHES  Forgive the fondness of o'erflowing love  That wishes still to hear those gentle lips  Breathe their soft vowsHow fares my boy Olinthus  The precious pledge of our connubial joys  That heaven bestow'd while distant with thy father  Four springs renewing since the Thracian grove  Timanthes march'd against his country's foes  ISMENA  Some God that watches o'er this pledge of love  Sure crowns his tender age with growing beauty  Or the fond mother with imagin'd grace  Has deck'd his infancy his looks already  Assume thy manly sternness when he smiles  He's all thyself and oft as I can steal  A wish'dfor look I gaze with rapture on him  And think I view Timanthes till deceiv'd  With the dear thought I strain him to my breast  And in the son embrace the absent father  TIMANTHES  What place contains our infant hope O lead  Lead me Ismena where these longing eyes  May in his features read a father's likeness  Or see them blooming with his mother's charms  ISMENA  Alas my lord awhile suppress these warm  Paternal feelingssome few miles remote  Sequester'd from the city on the edge  Of the rude forest Arcas and Ianthe  A rustic pair unconscious of their charge  Rear his young lifeAmidst the observing eyes  That watch a prince's deeds you must beware  And but with caution see himHeav'n allows  To us with scanty hand the parent's joys  In the soft moments of o'erflowing nature  To clasp him in our fond endearing arms  And bless the prattler with the tongue of transport  TIMANTHES  By heav'n it shall not beI'll burst at once  From dark dissimulation's veil'tis now  The crisis of our fate  ISMENA  It is indeed  Tomorrow's sun lights up the solemn day  Of annual sacrifice Ismena's name  Must stand enroll'd amongst th' elected train  That wait the dreadful chance  TIMANTHES  Ismena's name  ISMENA  'Tis so decreedand think not that I fear  To die for Thraceno for her country's sake  Ismena gladly would embrace her doom  But Phoebus' words demand a virgin's blood  Shall I a wife and mother dare approach  His sacred altar an unhallow'd victim  Thus if I speak or not I still am guilty  My silence heav'n offends my speech the king  TIMANTHES  The king must know the secret of our nuptials  All all demands is nowfor O Ismena  This very hour perhaps Cherinthus brings  A rival to thy loveCephisa comes  But now Demophoon urg'd me to receive  The Phrygian princessbut be witness heav'n  Not all the cruel policy of courts  Not the stern mandates of a king and father  Shall e'er dissolve those tender ties which love  Has form'd and virtue sanctifies  ISMENA  Alas  What can it all avail our union publish'd  Thou know'st the sentence of the law impends  On my devoted head  TIMANTHES  A monarch made  A monarch can revoke the stern decree  Demophoon tho' severe is still a parent  His kind indulgence shall avert the stroke  That threats Ismena  ISMENA  Rather let it come  Too long Timanthes hast thou sacrific'd  Thy glory to IsmenaO reflect  How ill the name of Thracia's heir agrees  With secret nuptials and clandestine love  Let me embrace my fateI die with joy  Since I in death can call Timanthes mine  TIMANTHES  O fortune wherefore did thy lavish hand  Give my Ismena every charm yet place  Her virtues in the vale of private life  But be it soit rests on me to amend  The partial errorThrace some future day  With joy shall view her partner of my throne  Farewell my love and let this fix'd assurance  Dwell in thy mind and calm thy troubled thoughts  Timanthes will be ever watchful o'er thee  And hold thy peace far dearer than his own  Exeunt severally  END  of the  FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE  A seaport  Enter  CHERINTHUS CEPHISA  and Attendants  CEPHISA  WHAT means this sadness prince With silent gaze  You look and sigh and if with friendly speech  I urge your converse when you seem prepar'd  To tell me much your fault'ring tongue is mute  Where is your wonted chearfulness the grace  That season'd your discourse Are you in Thrace  The same Cherinthus that I knew in Phrygia  Or is it thus with melancholy looks  You Thracians to her lord conduct a bride  CHERINTHUS  If my afflictions bear a sad presage  On me fair princess every evil fall  My stars can little add to griefs like mine  Nor breathes a wretch so hopeless as Cherinthus  CEPHISA  And claims Cephisa then so little share  In your esteem The time has been  CHERINTHUS  Forgive  This cold reserveand yet believe me fairone  There is a something here commands my silence  CEPHISA  'Tis true I am a woman and your secret  Were ill confided to our sex's weakness  I urge no furtherlead me to the palace  CHERINTHUS  Yet hearthose eyes like light'ning pierce my soul  And all my firm resolves are lost before them  O turn Cephisa and with gentler looks  Unbend those brows while trembling I confess  'Tis thou hast robb'd me of my peaceI gaze  With rapture on thy matchless charms I own  My love is fruitless all that these fond wishes  Would grasp they know not what I know that death  Alone can end my pains  CEPHISA  What means Cherinthus  CHERINTHUS  I knew too well I should offendAnd yet  The faults of love  CEPHISA  ForbearI'll hear no more  Is this the brother of Timanthes This  The prince deputed by the Thracian king  And is it thus Cherinthus thinks to guard  That faith a brother and a father claim  CHERINTHUS  I own my crimeI know that every tie  Of son and brother should forbid my passion  Why was I only singled by Demophoon  To bring thee to Timanthes Could I view  Thy charms and yet resistI saw and lov'd  Each day beheld me near thee while the name  Of kinsman gave a license to my tongue  Nor did this name alone deceive the world  I was deceiv'd myselfthat love which made  Me sigh for ever for Cephisa's presence  Appear'd but duty and a thousand times  I thought to paint the affections of a brother  While my too eager speech betray'd my own  CEPHISA  aside  Alas 'twas not in vainCephisa too  Perceiv'd a something she would fain disown  CHERINTHUS  And yet sometimes I felt a flattering hope  Methought I oft observ'd a tender sigh  Steal from thy breast view'd in thy eyes a softness  That seem'd much more than friendship  CEPHISA  Hold Cherinthus  Thou dost begin to abuse my easy nature  It ill befits the daughter of Nicanor  Affianc'd to Timanthes heir of Thrace  To hear with calmness these injurious vows  At once destructive to her peace and fame  CHERINTHUS  Forgive me princess and I will obey  Thou shalt no more reproach my daring love  Injurious to thy glorySpite of all  The pangs that rend my heart conviction's force  Dwells in thy words and I'll no more offend  No I will strive to wear the face of joy  And kindly bless my happier brother's fate  Enter  TIMANTHES  Welcome Timanthes to thy native land  Fame the loud harbinger of thy approach  Has rous'd each Thracian son to hail thy presence  And I but join the common voice  TIMANTHES  Receive  In this embrace my thanksbut say Cherinthus  Is this the royal fair one who forsakes  Her country's gentle seat to visit Thrace  And with her beauties gild our rougher clime  CHERINTHUS  It isBehold while others with applause  Congratulate thy fortune what a treasure  Thy brother brings to give thee every blessing  That love and beauty can bestow  TIMANTHES  Her looks  Bespeak perfectionLet Timanthes then  Imperial virgin greet thy save arrival  From Phrygia's happy shoreVouchsafe awhile  Cherinthus to retire apartmy thoughts  Revolve some secret of import that claims  The princess' ear alone  CHERINTHUS  I shall obey  What can this mean But wherefore ask or what  Avails their converse to the lost Cherinthus  walks aside  TIMANTHES  How shall Timanthes beauteous princess dress  His thoughts in apt expression I should now  Pour forth the raptures of a heart decreed  To excellence like yoursbut O there is  Fatality in man and oft when Heaven  Holds out an unexpected blessing to us  Some mystery forbids  CEPHISA  What would the prince  Let not Timanthes seek the low disguise  Of art the refuge of ignoble minds  But boldly as he meets his foes in battle  Speak out his secret soul  TIMANTHES  The statesman oft  Joins with the specious plea of public good  Two hearts averse our parents have decreed  An union to thyself perhaps ungrateful  Thy virtues might demand the noblest heart  But fate forbids us ever to unite  There is a bar which nothing can surmount  My father knows it not nor must I speak it  Refuse refuse me then enlarge my faults  And thus preserve thy fame my peace and life  CEPHISA  'Tis wellmy lord  TIMANTHES  I see the conscious pride  Of greatness rising on thy cheekmy presence  But adds to your displeasuremy Cherinthus  The care be thine with every mark of honour  Such as may suit her station and desert  To lead from hence the princess to the palace  Exit  CEPHISA  What have I heard Is this the boasted youth  Whom fame extols for gallantry and arms  And is it thus he treats a virgin sprung  From Phrygia's scepter'd kingsneglected Heavens  And shall I tamely bear this outrage  CHERINTHUS  coming forward  Princess  What indignation rises in your breast  Your looks are chang'dhas then my brother  CEPHISA  Yes  I see your mutual purpose to betray me  Was it for this I left my native land  Left the lov'd arms of an indulgent father  To meet with insult on this foreign shore  To bear unmov'd the injury that waits  Cherinthus' passion and his brother's scorn  But if Demophoon  Enter  ADRASTUS

 Against her helpless life  MATHUSIUS  Because I sought  To exclude Ismena from the lots of fate  Because I durst produce his own example  But now I met him near the temple's porch  Encompass'd by the priests with all the warmth  Of a fond father trembling for his child  I urg'd entreatedbut in vainthe king  Beheld me with an haughty eye enrag'd  My tongue reproach'd the monarch's partial voice

appease my father  Yet love shall point the way  MATHUSIUS  Noevery hope  Is now extinct and black despair shuts up  The gloomy prospect  TIMANTHES  Can the son in vain  Plead with a father for his

adieu to Thrace  While now Timanthes with presaging hope  Anticipates the hour decreed to bless  The prince and lover when this solemn day  Shall pass whose rising light now faintly strikes  The sacred laurels where the temple's grove  Receives the dawn  CEPHISA  Believe me my resolves  Are such as suit my sex and rank the name  Of virgin and of princess both require me  To quit the Thracian palacefor Timanthes  No longer urge  DEMOPHOON  I can forgive thy anger  Nurs'd in the pleasures of the Phrygian court  A Thracian's manners may be harsh to thee  Wonder not then if so Timanthes seems  Inur'd to rugged arms be thine the glory  To teach him first the flowery path that leads  To the calm dwelling of domestic sweets  What cannot charms like thineyes fair Cephisa  Those eyes shall thaw the ice around his heart  And warm the youth to unexperienc'd love  CEPHISA  My lord it cannot beas soon this morn  That spreads the veil of sorrow o'er the land  Might raise each heart with gladness as Cephisa  Find happiness in Thraceat thy command  And thine alone the ships can quit the port  To bear me back to my paternal land  Give orders then to loose the bark whose sails  Must waft me hence for ever  DEMOPHOON  Think not princess  Demophoon would detain thee while thy thoughts  Revisit Phrygia yet permit me now  To say I hop'd far other from the daughter  Of him whose wish'd alliance promis'd all  An anxious king and parent could demand  But yet whate'er thy wish till the next sun  Thou canst not hence no vessel from the port  Presumes to rear the mast or spread the sail  Till this sad day declines  CEPHISA  Since now the law  Forbids to quit the realm I must submit  To breathe the air of Thraceyet I respect  The friend of great Nicanor but remember  My father's honour and my own nay more  Demophoon's urges me to leave a court  Where every moment's voluntary stay  Insults my sex's rights and stains my glory  Exit  DEMOPHOON  alone  Ha whence is this sure something lurks beneath  That yet I know notI remember now  When first I nam'd the princess that my son  Heard with reluctanceshould he disobey  A father's just resentmentbut no more  It cannot beI am alarm'd too soon  Enter  TIMANTHES  TIMANTHES  Where is my king  DEMOPHOON  Timanthes thou art come  In happy time  TIMANTHES  Dread sir permit your son  To sue for grace and pardon  DEMOPHOON  Say for whom  Dost thou intreat  TIMANTHES  For an unhappy victim  One whose misfortune is her only crime  The daughter of Mathusius  DEMOPHOON  'Tis too late  Her doom is seal'd  TIMANTHES  Grant to your suppliant son  Her guiltless life  DEMOPHOON  And dar'st thou still presume  To name her If thou valu'st ought my love  Forego this vain request  TIMANTHES  Alas my father  I cannot now obey youO if ever  I have deserv'd a parent's tenderness  If with a bosom seam'd with honest scars  I have return'd a conqueror to your arms  If e'er my triumphs in the glorious field  Have drawn the tear of pleasure from your eyes  Release forgive Ismenalost unhappy  She has no friend but me to plead her cause  And shall she perishthink you view her now  In early bloom of life who never knew  The thoughts of guilt stretch'd on the fatal altar  In all the pangs of sufferingthink you see  The lifewarm blood gush from her tender breast  Hear the last accents from her trembling lips  Behold her dying eyesbut thou art pale  Why look'st thou thus upon meO my father  I see I see the gracious signs of pity  Do not repent my lordindulge it still  For never will I quit these sacred feet  Till thou hast given the word to spare Ismena  DEMOPHOON  Rise princeAlmighty powers what must I think  That with such tenderness thou nam'st Ismena  Yet mark how far my fond indulgence yields  On one condition I recall her sentence  Ismena yet may live but if the father  Impell'd by love forgets his just resentment  Let not the son forget the sacred ties  Of gratitude and duty  TIMANTHES  Never never  Timanthes shall forget them every hour  To come shall bless your goodness for this pardon  Which life itself were cheaply given to parchase  DEMOPHOON  No my dear son my future peace and thine  Ask but one sacrifice and all is well  What hast thou done to offend the Phrygian princess  Learn to respect my choice in fair Cephisa  Have I not felt compassion for thy weakness  Do thou preserve my honourthink Timanthes  Nor let the breath of rumour taint my name  Then let us seek Cephisa there my son  Instruct thy lips to deprecate the anger  I fear thy scorn has justly rais'dtomorrow  We'll to the temple thither shalt thou lead  Thy beauteous bride and at the altar there  At once before th' attesting Gods fulfill  What justice claims from thee and from Demophoon  TIMANTHES  My lord I cannot  DEMOPHOON  Prince thou yet hast heard  The father only force me not to employ  The king's authority  TIMANTHES  Sacred alike  I hold the dictates of the king and father  But love disdains compulsion  DEMOPHOON  In the heart  Of subjects love may rule with sovereign sway  But in a prince on whom a nation's weal  Depends it ill beseems to sacrifice  The good of thousands to the selfish weakness  That better fits a cottage than a throne  TIMANTHES  Hard state of royalty if on such terms  Timanthes must be king take back ye powers  The dignity ye gavecan Heaven decree  That public virtue never should reside  Where the soft passions dwell Must he whose cares  Incessant labour for the good of others  Still want that happiness he gives to all  DEMOPHOON  And dar'st thou dress thy disobedience thus  In reason's garb to oppose my sovereign will  Hence every partial weaknessjust resentment  Points out the way to reach thy stubborn heart  This darling of thy soul Ismenashe  Shall pay the forfeitnow I see full well  What caus'd thy coldnessshe shall die  TIMANTHES  O heaven  DEMOPHOON  Away  TIMANTHES  Yet hear me sir  DEMOPHOON  I've heard too much  This day Ismena dies  TIMANTHES  Forbid it

passion's wild extremewould'st thou preserve  The peace of thy unhappy son preserve  His fame his allrevoke Ismena's doom  He answers notthat look confirms her death  Farewellbut whither whither shall I fly  To shun myselfIsmena's image still  Hangs on my sight and haunts my tortur'd soul  Exit  DEMOPHOON  alone  Where where Demophoon is the mighty power  A monarch boasts when all insult thee thus  'Tis time to assert my rightsAdrastus  Enter  ADRASTUS  Haste  Give orders that the victim be prepar'd  This instant for the sacrifice  ADRASTUS  Already  Ismena vested in the robes of death  Expects the fatal hourI heard the priests  Exhort her with becoming fortitude  To yield her life a sacrifice for Thrace  While with a downcast look the virgin stood  In all the majesty of silent woe  And now they wait thy last command alone  To bear her to the temple  DEMOPHOON  Her misfortune  Excites my pity but her father's bold  Rebellious insults on my crown and fame  My own repose the glory of my realm  Demand her deaththe weal of Thrace requires  Timanthes' marriage with the Phrygian princess  But this Timanthes never will compleat  While she survivesthis obstacle remov'd  The flame of stubborn love shall soon decay  And the rash youth who now condemns my power  Shall yield obedience to a parent's will  Exeunt  SCENE  An open part of the city  Enter  TIMANTHES  and  MATHUSIUS  MATHUSIUS  And canst thou then partake Mathusius' fortune  A willing exile from thy father's kingdom  Think think my son when thou shalt wander hence  An obscure fugitive will then Ismena  With chaste endearments from thy mind erase  Remembrance of the prince Will not the phantom  Of royalty still haunt thy lonely hours  Wilt thou not then regret paternal wealth  Abandon'd and a scepter lost  TIMANTHES  No more  My wife and son are dearer far than all  Each other good has no intrinsic worth  Opinion makes it great the tender feelings  Of father husband are not bred by custom  Or early thoughts instill'd from infancy  The seeds are in ourselves are with us born  Grow with our life and but with life expire  MATHUSIUS  But how to set her free Is she not now  Encompass'd by Demophoon's guards  TIMANTHES  The care  Be mine to elude their utmost vigilance  Assisted by some chosen friends I'll bear  Ismena safe from danger  MATHUSIUS  Mighty powers  Direct our flighteach moment that

tongue of praise  Owes to that ruling Power who governs all  END  of the  FIFTH ACT  EPILOGUE  Written by GEORGE COLMAN  Esq  Spoken by Mrs BULKLEY  WHAT horrors fill the tragic poet's brain  Plague murder rape and incest croud his train  He pants for miseries delights in ills  The blood of fathers mothers children spills  Stabs poisons massacres and in his rage  With daggers bowls and carpets strews the stage  Our gentler poet in soft opera bred  Italian crotchets singing in his head  Winds to a prosp'rous end the finedrawn tale  And roarsbut roars like any nightingale  Woman whate'er she bemaid widow wife  A quiet woman is the charm of life  And sure Cephisa was a gentle creature  Fuil of the milk and honey of goodnature  Imported for a spouseby spouse refus'd  Was ever maid so shamefully abus'd  And yet alas poor prince I could not blame him  One wife I'knew was full enough to tame him  Ismena and Timanthes and Olinthus  Might all be happyfor I chose Cherinthus  But what a barb'rous law was this of Thrace  How cruel  there  was each young lady's case  A virgin plac'd upon the dreadful roll  A hapless virgin must have stood the poll  But by Timanthes made a lucky bride  Ismena prudently  disqualify'd  Ladies to you alone our author sues  'Tis yours to cherish or condemn his muse  The theatre's a mirror and each play  Should be a very lookingglass they say  His lookingglass reflects no moles or pimples  But shews you full of graces smiles and dimples  If you approve yourselves resolve to spare  And critics then attack him if ye dare  FINIS
