 THE WANDERER A POEM In FIVE CANTO's  By  RICHARD SAVAGE  Son of the late Earl  RIVERS  Nulla mali  nova m√Æ facies inopinave surgit  Virg  LONDON  Printed for J WALTHOE overagainst the  Royal Exchange  in  Cornhill  Price Two Shillings  To the Right Honourable  JOHN  Lord Viscount  Tyrconnel  Baron  Charleville  and Lord  Brownlowe  Knight of the  Bath  My LORD  _PART of this POEM had the Honour of your Lordship's Perusal when in Manuscript and it was no small Pride to me when it met with  Approbation from so distinguishing a Judge Should the rest find the like Indulgence I shall have no Occasion whatever its Success may be in the World to repent the Labour it has cost meBut my Intention is not to pursue a Discourse on my own Performance No my Lord it is to embrace this Opportunity of throwing out Sentiments that relate to your Lordship's Goodness the Generosity of which give me Leave to say I have greatly experienc'd  I offer it not as a new Remark that Dependance on the Great in former Times generally terminated in Disappointment nay even their Bounty if it could be  called such was in its very Nature ungenerous It was perhaps withheld thro' an indolent or wilful Neglect 'till those who lingered in the Want of it grew almost past the Sense of Comfort At length it came too often in a Manner that half cancell'd the Obligation and perchance must have been acquired too by some previous Act of Guilt in the Receiver the Consequence of which was Remorse and Infamy  But  that I live  my Lord is a Proof that Dependance on your Lordship and the present Ministry is an Assurance of Success I am persuaded Distress in many other Instances affects your Soul with a Compassion that always  shews itself in a manner most humane and active that to forgive Injuries and confer Benefits is your Delight and that to deserve your Friendship is to deserve the Countenance of the best of Men To be admitted into the Honour of your Lordship's Conversation permit me to speak but Justice is to be elegantly introduced into the most instructive as well as entertaining Parts of Literature it is to be furnish'd with the finest Observations upon human Nature and to receive from the most unassuming sweet and winning Candour the worthiest and most polite MaximsSuch as are always enforc'd by the Actions of your own Life I could also take Notice of your many publickspirited  Services to your Country in Parliament and your constant Attachment to Liberty and the Royal Illustrious House of our Most  Gracious Sovereign  But my Lord believe me your own Deeds are the noblest and fittest Orators to speak your Praise and will elevate it far beyond the Power of a much abler Writer than I am  I will therefore turn my View from your Lordship's Virtues to the kind Influence of them which has been so lately shed upon me and then if my future Morals and Writings shall gain any Approbation from Men of Parts and Probity I must acknowledge all to be the Product of your  Lordship's Goodness to me I must in fine say with  Horace  Quod spiro placeo si placeo tuum est  I am with the highest Gratitude and Veneration  My LORD  Your Lordship's most Dutiful And Devoted Servant R SAVAGE  THE WANDERER A VISION In Five CANTOS  CANTO I  _FAIN wou'd my Verse TYRCONNEL boast thy Name  BROWNLOW at once my Subject and my Fame  Oh cou'd that Spirit which thy Bosom warms  Whose Strength surprizes and whose Goodness charms  That various Worthcou'd that inspire my Lays  Envy shou'd smile and Censure learn to praise  Yet tho' unequal to a Soul like thine  A generous Soul approaching to Divine  When bless'd beneath such Patronage I write  Great my Attempt tho' hazardous my Flight  O'er ample Nature I extend my Views  Nature to rural Scenes invites the Muse  She flies all public Care all venal Strife  To try the  Still  compar'd with  Active  Life  To prove by these the Sons of Men may owe  The Fruits of Bliss to bursting Clouds of Woe  That ev'n Calamity by Thought refin'd  Inspirits and adorns the thinking Mind  Come CONTEMPLATION whose unbounded Gaze  Swift in a Glance the Course of Things surveys  Who in  Thyself  the various View can'st find  Of Sea Land Air and Heav'n and human Kind  What Tides of Passion in the Bosom roll  What Thoughts debase and what exalt the Soul  Whose Pencil paints obsequious to thy Will  All thou survey'st with a creative Skill  Oh leave awhile thy lov'd sequester'd Shade  Awhile in wintry Wilds vouchsafe thy Aid  Then waft me to some olive bow'ry Green  Where cloath'd in white thou shew'st a Mind serene  Where kind  Content  from Noise and Court retires  And smiling sits while Muses tune their Lyres  Where  Zephyrs  gently breathe while  Sleep  profound  To their soft Fanning nods with Poppies crown'd  Sleep  on a Treasure of bright Dreams reclines  By  thee  bestow'd whence  Fancy  colour'd shines  And flutters round his Brow a hov'ring Flight  Varying her Plumes in visionary Light  The solar Fires now faint and watry burn  Just where with Ice  Aquarius  frets his Urn  If thaw'd fullissue from its Mouth severe  Raw Clouds that sadden all th'inverted Year  When FROST and FIRE with martial Pow'rs engag'd  FROST northward fled the War unequal wag'd  Beneath the Pole his Legions urg'd their Flight  And gain'd a Cave profound and wide as Night  O'er chearless Scenes by Desolation own'd  High on an Alp of Ice he sits enthron'd  One claycold Hand his crystal Beard sustains  And scepter'd One o'er Wind and Tempest reigns  O'er stony Magazines of Hail that storm  The blossom'd Fruit and flow'ry Spring deform  His languid Eyes like frozen Lakes appear  Dimgleaming all the Light that wanders here  His Robe snowwrought and hoar'd with Age his Breath  A nitrous Damp that strikes pertific Death  Far hence lies everfreez'd the Northern Main  That checks and renders Navigation vain  That shut against the Sun's dissolving Ray  Scatters the trembling Tides of vanquish'd Day  And stretching  Eastward  half the World secures  Defies Discov'ry and like Time endures  Now FROST sent boreal Blasts to scourge the Air  To bind the Streams and leave the Landscape bare  Yet when  farwest  his Violence declines  Tho' here the Brook or Lake his Pow'r confines  To rocky Pools to Cat'racts are unknown  His Chainsto Rivers rapid like the  Rhone  The falling Moon cast cold a quiv'ring Light  Just silver'd o'er the Snow and sunkPale Night  Retir'd The Dawn in lightgrey Mists arose  Shrill chants the Cockthe hungry Heifer lows  Slow blush yon breaking Cloudsthe Sun's uproll'd  Th'expansive  Grey  turns azure chac'd with Gold  Whiteglitt'ring Ice chang'd like the  Topaz  gleams  Reflecting Saffron Lustre from his Beams  O  Contemplation  teach me to explore  From  Britain  far remote some distant Shore  From  Sleep  a Dream distinct and lively Claim  Clear let the Vision strike the Moral's Aim  It comes I feel it o'er my Soul serene  Still  Morn  begins and  Frost  retains the Scene  Harkthe loud Horn's enlivening Note's begun  From Rock to Vale sweetwand'ring Echoes run  Still floats the Sound shrillwinding from afar  Wild Beasts astonish'd dread the Sylvan War  Spears to the Sun in Files embattled play  March on charge briskly and enjoy the Fray  Swans Ducks and Geese and the wing'd Winter Brood  Chatter discordant on yon echoing Flood  At  Babel  thus when Heav'n the Tongue confounds  Sudden a thousand different jargon Sounds  Like jangling Bells harshmingling grate the Ear  All stare all talk all mean but none cohere  Mark wiley Fowlers meditate their Doom  And smoky  Fate  speeds thund'ring thro' the Gloom  Stop'd short they cease in airy Rings to fly  Whirl o'er and o'er and flutt'ring fall and die  Still Fancy wafts me on deceiv'd I stand  Estrang'd adventrous on a foreign Land  Wide and more wide extends the Scene unknown  Where shall I turn a  Wanderer  and alone  From hilly Wilds and Depths where Snows remain  My winding Steps up a steep Mountain strain  Emers'd atop I mark the Hills subside  And Tow'rs aspire but with inferior Pride  On this bleak Height tall Firs with Icework crown'd  Bend while their flaky Winter shades the Ground  Hoarse and direct a blust'ring Northwind blows  On Boughs thickrustling crack the crispid Snows  Tangles of Frost half fright the wilder'd Eye  By Heat oft blacken'd like a low'ring Sky  Hence down the Side two turbid Riv'lets pour  And devious Two in one huge Cat'ract roar  While pleas'd the watry Progress I pursue  Yon Rocks in rough Assemblage rush in View  In form an Amphitheatre they rise  And a dark Gulph in their broad Center lies  There the dim'd Sight with dizzy Weakness fails  And Horror o'er the firmest Brain prevails  Thither these Mountainstreams their Passage take  Headlong foam down and form a dreadful Lake  The Lake highswelling so redundant grows  From the heap'd Store deriv'd a River flows  Which deep'ning travels thro' a distant Wood  And thence emerging meets a Sisterflood  Mingled they flash on a wideopening Plain  And pass yon City to the farseen Main  So blend two Souls by Heav'n for Union made  And strength'ning forward lend a mutual Aid  And prove in ev'ry transient Turn their Aim  Thro' finite Life to infinite the same  Nor ends the LandscapeOcean to my Sight  Points a blue Arm where sailing Ships delight  In Prospect lessen'dNow new Rocks rear'd high  Stretch a cross Ridge and bar the curious Eye  There lies obscur'd the ripening Diamond's Ray  And thence redbranching Coral's rent away  In conic Form there gelid Crystal grows  Thro' such the PalaceLamp gay Lustre throws  Lustre which thro' dim Night as various plays  As play from yonder Snows the changeful Rays  For nobler Use the Crystal's Worth may rise  If Tubes perspective hem the spotless Prize  Thro' these the Beams of the farlengthen'd Eye  Measure known Stars and new remoter spy  Hence  Commerce  many a shorten'd Voyage steers  Shorten'd to Months the Hazard once of Years  Hence HALLEY's Soul etherial Flight essays  Instructive there from Orb to Orb she strays  Sees round new countless Suns new Systems roll  Sees God in  All  and magnifies the Whole  Yon rocky Side enrich'd the Summer Scene  And Peasant's Search with Herbs of healthful Green  Now naked pale and comfortless it lies  Like Youth extended cold in Death's Disguise  There while without the sounding Tempest swells  Incav'd secure th'exulting Eagle dwells  And there when Nature owns prolific Spring  Spreads o'er her Young a fondling Mother's Wing  Swains on the Coast the farfam'd Fish descry  That gives the fleecy Robe the  Tyrian  Dye  While Shells a scatter'd Ornament bestow  The tinctur'd Rivals of the show'ry Bow  Yon limeless Sands loosedriving with the Wind  In future Cauldrons useful Texture find  Till on the Furnace thrown the glowing Mass  Brightens and bright'ning hardens into Glass  When winter Halcyons flick'ring on the Wave  Tune their Complaints yon Sea forgets to rave  Tho' lash'd by Storms which naval Pride o'erturn  The foaming Deep in Sparkles seems to burn  Loud Winds turn Zephyrs to enlarge their Notes  And each safe Nest on a calm Surface floats  Now veers the Wind full East and keen and sore  Its cutting Influence akes in ev'ry Pore  How weak thy Fabrick ManA Puff thus blown  Staggers thy Strength and echoes to thy Groan  A Tooth's minutest Nerve let Anguish seize  Swift kindred Fibres catch so frail our Ease  Pinch'd pierc'd and torn enflam'd and unassuag'd  They smart and swell and throb and shoot enrag'd  From Nerve to Nerve fierce flies th'exulting Pain  And are we of this mighty Fabrick vain  Now my Blood chills scarce thro' my Veins it glides  Sure on each Blast a shiv'ring Ague rides  Warn'd let me this bleak Eminence forsake  And to the Vale a diff'rent Winding take  Half I descend My Spirits fast decay  A Terrass now relieves my weary Way  Close with this Stage a Precipice combines  Whence still the spacious Country far declines  The Herds seem Insects in the distant Glades  And Men diminish'd as at Noon their Shades  Thick on this Top o'ergrown for Walks are seen  Grey leafless Wood and winter Greens between  The red'ning Berry deepting'd Holly shows  And matted Misleto the white bestows  Tho' lost the Banquet of autumnal Fruits  Tho' on broad Oaks no vernal Umbrage shoots  These Boughs the silenc'd shiv'ring Songsters seek  These foodful Berries fill the hungry Beak  Beneath appears a Place all outward bare  Inward the dreary Mansion of Despair  The Water of the MountainRoad halfstray'd  Breaks o'er it wild and falls a brown Cascade  Has Nature this rough naked Piece design'd  To hold Inhabitant of mortal Kind  She has Approach'd appears a deep Descent  Which opens in a Rock a large Extent  And harkits hollow Entrance reach'd I hear  A trampling Sound of Footsteps hast'ning near  A deathlike Chillness thwarts my panting Breast  Soft the wish'd Object stands at length confest  Of Youth his FormBut why with Anguish bent  Why pin'd with sallow Marks of Discontent  Yet Patience lab'ring to beguile his Care  Seems to raise Hope and smiles away Despair  Compassion  in his Eye surveys my Grief  And in his Voice invites me to Relief  Preventive of thy Call behold my haste  He says Nor let warm Thanks thy Spirits waste  All Fear forgetEach Portal I possess  Duty wideopens to receive Distress  Oblig'd I follow by his Guidance led  The vaulted Roof reechoing to our Tread  And now in squar'd Divisions I survey  Chambers sequester'd from the Glare of Day  Yet needful Lights are taught to intervene  Thro' Rifts each forming a perspective Scene  In Front a Parlour meets my ent'ring View  Oppos'd a Room to sweet Refection due  Here my chill'd Veins are warm'd by chippy Fires  Thro' the bor'd Rock above the Smoke expires  Neat o'er a homely Board a Napkin's spread  Crown'd with a heapy Canister of Bread  A Maple Cup is next dispatch'd to bring  The Comfort of the salutary Spring  Nor mourn we absent Blessings of the Vine  Here laughs a frugal Bowl of rosy Wine  And sav'ry Cates upon clear Embers cast  Lie hissing till snatch'd off a rich Repast  Soon leap my Spirits with enliven'd Pow'r  And in gay Converse glides the feastful Hour  The  Hermit  thus Thou wonder'st at thy Fare  On me yon City kind bestows her Care  Meat for keen Famine and the gen'rous Juice  That warms chill'd Life her Charities produce  Accept without Reward unask'd 'twas mine  Here what thy Health requires as free be thine  Hence learn that GOD who in the Time of Need  In frozen Desarts can the Raven feed  Wellsought will delegate some pitying Breast  His second Means to succour Man distrest  He paus'd Deep Thought upon his Aspect gloom'd  Then He with Smile humane his Voice resum'd  I'm just inform'd and laugh me not to scorn  By One unseen by thee thou'rt  Englishborn  Of  England  ITo me the  British  State  Rises in dear Memorial ever great  Here stand we consciousDiffidence suspend  Free flow our WordsDid ne'er thy Muse extend  To Grots where  Contemplation  smiles serene  Where Angels visit and where Joys convene  To Groves where more than mortal Voices rise  Catch the rapt Soul and waft it to the Skies  This CaveYon WalksBut e'er I more unfold  What artful Scenes thy Eyes shall here behold  Think Subjects of my Toil nor wond'ring gaze  What cannot  Industry  completely raise  Be the whole Earth in one great Landscape found  By  Industry  is all with Beauty crown'd  He He alone explores the Mine for Gain  Hues the hard Rock or harrows up the Plain  He forms the Sword to smite He sheaths the Steel  Draws Health from Herbs and shews the Balm to heal  Or with loom'd Wool the native Robe supplies  Or bids young Plants in future Forests rise  Or fells the monarch Oak which borne away  Shall with new Grace the distant Ocean sway  Hence golden  Commerce  views her Wealth encrease  The blissful Child of Liberty and Peace  He scoops the stubborn  Alps  and still employ'd  Fills with soft fertile Mold the steril Void  Slop'd up white Rocks small yellow Harvests grow  And green on terrass'd Stages Vineyards blow  By him fall Mountains to a level Space  An  Isthmus  sinks and sunder'd Seas embrace  He founds a City on the naked Shore  And Desolation starves the Tract no more  From the wild Waves he won the  Belgic  Land  Where wide they foam'd her Towns and Trafficks stand  He clear'd manur'd enlarg'd the furtive Ground  And firms the Conquest with his fenceful Mound  Ev'n  Mid  the watry World his  Venice  rose  Each Fabric there as  Pleasure  's Seat he shows  There Marts Sports Councils are for Action sought  Landscapes for Health and Solitude for Thought  What wonder then I by his potent Aid  A Mansion in a barren Mountain made  Part thou hast view'dIf further we explore  Let  Industry  deserve Applause the more  No frowning Care yon blest Apartment sees  There  Sleep  retires and finds a Couch of Ease  Kind Dreams that fly Remorse and pamper'd Wealth  There shed the Smiles of Innocence and Health  MarkHere descends a Grot delightful Seat  Which warms ev'n Winter tempers Summer's Heat  SeeGurgling from a Top a Spring distils  In mournful Measures wind the dripping Rills  Soft Cooes of distant Doves receiv'd around  In soothing Mixture swell the wat'ry Sound  And hence the Streamlets seek the terrass Shade  Within without alike to all convey'd  Pass onNew Scenes by my creative Pow'r  Invite Reflection's sweet and solemn Hour  We enter'd where in wellrang'd Order stood  Th' instructive Volumes of the Wise and Good  These Friends said he tho' I desert Mankind  Good Angels never wou'd permit behind  Each Genius Youth conceals or Time displays  I know each Work some Seraph here conveys  Retirement  thus presents my searchful Thought  What Heav'n inspir'd and what the Muse has taught  What YOUNG Satiric and Sublime has writ  Whose Life is Virtue and whose Muse is Wit  Rapt I foresee thy  Author of a Poem call'd The  Excursion  MALLET's early Aim  Shine in full Worth and shoot at length to Fame  Sweet Fancy's Bloom in FENTON's Lay appears  And the ripe Judgment of instructive Years  In HILL is all that gen'rous Souls revere  To Virtue and the Muse for ever dear  And THOMSON in this Praise thy Merit see  The Tongue that praises Merit praises thee  These scorn said I the  VerseWright  of their Age  Vain of a labour'd languid useless Page  To whose dim Faculty the meaning Song  Is glaring or obscure when clear and strong  Who in cant Phrases gives a Work Disgrace  His Wit an Odness of his Tone and Face  Let the weak Malice nurs'd to an Essay  In some low Libel a mean Heart display  Those who once prais'd now undeceiv'd despise  It lives contemn'd a Day then harmless dies  Or shou'd some nobler Bard their Worth unpraise  Deserting Morals that adorn his Lays  Alas too oft each Science shews the same  The Great grow jealous of a greater Name  Ye Bards the Frailty mourn yet brave the Shock  Has not a STILLINGFLEET oppos'd a LOCKE  Oh still proceed with sacred Rapture fir'd  Unenvied had ye liv'd if unadmir'd  Let  Envy  he replied allireful rise  Envy  pursues alone the Brave and Wise  MARO and SOCRATES inspire her Pain  And POPE the  Monarch  of the tuneful Train  To whom be  Nature  's and  Britannia  's Praise  All their bright Honours rush into his Lays  And all that glorious Warmth his Lays reveal  Which only Poets Kings and Patriots feel  Tho' gay as Mirth as curious Thought sedate  As Elegance polite as Pow'r elate  Profound as Reason and as Justice clear  Soft as Compassion yet as Truth severe  As Bounty copious as Persuasion sweet  Like Nature various and like Art complete  So fine her Morals so sublime her Views  His Life is almost equal'd by his Muse  O POPESince Envy is decreed by Fate  Since she pursues alone the Wise and Great  In one small emblematic Landscape see  How vast a Distance 'twixt thy Foe and Thee  Truth  from an Eminence surveys our Scene  A Hill where all is clear and all serene  Rude earthbred Storms o'er meaner Valleys blow  And wand'ring Mists roll black'ning far below  Dark and debas'd like them is  Envy  's Aim  And clear and eminent like  Truth  thy Fame  Thus I From what dire Cause can Envy spring  Or why embosom we a Viper's Sting  'Tis Envy stings our darling Passion Pride  Alas the Man of mighty Soul replied  Why chuse we Mis'ries Most derive their Birth  From one bad Source we dread superior Worth  Prefer'd it seems a Satire on our own  Then heedless to excel we meanly moan  Then we abstract our Views and Envy show  Whence springs the Mis'ry Pride is doom'd to know  Thus Folly pain creates By Wisdom's Pow'r  We shun the Weight of many a restless Hour  Lo I meet Wrong perhaps the Wrong I feel  Tends by the Scheme of Things to publick Weal  I of the Whole am Partthe Joy Men see  Must circulate and so revolve to me  Why shou'd I then of private Loss complain  Of Loss that proves perchance a Brother's Gain  The Wind that binds one Bark within the Bay  May waft a richer Freight its wish'dfor Way  If Rains redundant flood the abject Ground  Mountains are but supplied when Vales are drown'd  If with soft Moisture swell'd the Vale looks gay  The Verdure of the Mountain fades away  Shall Clouds but at  my  Welfare's Call descend  Shall  Gravity  for me her Laws suspend  For me shall Suns their Noontide Course forbear  Or  Motion  not subsist to influence Air  Let the Means vary be they Frost or Flame  Thy End O Nature still remains the same  Be This the Motive of a wise Man's Care  To shun deserving Ills and learn to bear  The END of the FIRST CANTO  THE WANDERER A VISION  CANTO II  _WHILE thus a Mind humane and wise he shows  Alleloquent of Truth his Language flows  Youth tho' depress'd thro' all his Form

check the Growth of Sin  When first we met how soon you seem'd to know  My Bosom lab'ring with the Throbs of Woe  Such racking Throbssoft when I rouze those Cares  On my chill'd Mind pale  Recollection  glares  When moping  Frenzy  strove my Thoughts to sway  Here prudent Labours chac'd her Pow'r away  Full and roughrising from yon sculptur'd Wall  Bold Prophets Nations to Repentance call  Meek Martyrs smile in Flames gor'd Champions groan  And Muselike Cherubs tune their Harps in Stone  Next shadow'd Light a rounding Force bestows  Swells into Life and speaking Action grows  Here pleasing melancholy Subjects find  To calm amuse exalt the pensive Mind  This Figure tender Grief like mine implies  And semblant Thoughts that earthly Pomp despise  Such penitential  Magdalene  reveals  Looseveil'd in Negligence of Charms she kneels  Tho' Dress nearstor'd its Vanity supplies  The Vanity of Dress unheeded lies  The sinful World in sorrowing Eye she keeps  As o'er  Jerusalem Messiah  weeps  One Hand her Bosom smites in One appears  The lifted Lawn that drinks her falling Tears  Since Evil outweighs Good and sways Mankind  True Fortitude assumes the patient Mind  Such prov'd  Messiah  's tho' to suff'ring born  To Penury Repulse Reproach and Scorn  Here by the Pencil mark his Flight design'd  The wearied Virgin by a Stream reclin'd  Who feeds the Child Her Looks a Charm express  A modest Charm that dignifies Distress  Boughs o'er their Heads with blushing Fruits depend  Which Angels to her busied Consort bend  Hence by the smiling Infant seems discern'd  Trifles concerning him all Heav'n concern'd  Here the transfigur'd Son from Earth retires  See the white Form in a bright Cloud aspires  Full on his Foll'wers bursts a Flood of Rays  Prostrate they fall beneath th' o'erwhelming Blaze  Like Noontide SummerSuns the Rays appear  Unsuff'rable magnificent and near  What Scene of Agony the Garden brings  The Cup of Gall the suppliant King of Kings  The Crown of Thorns the Cross that felt him die  These languid in the Sketch unfinish'd lye  There from the Dead Centurions see him rise  See but struck down with horrible Surprize  As the first Glory seem'd a Sun at Noon  This casts the Silver Splendor of the Moon  Here peopled Day th'ascending God surveys  The Glory varies as the Myriads gaze  Now soften'd like a Sun at Distance seen  When thro' a Cloud brightglancing yet serene  Now fastencreasing to the Croud amaz'd  Like some vast Meteor high in Ether rais'd  My Labour yon highvaulted Altar stains  With Dies that emulate etherial Plains  The convex Glass which in that Opening glows  Mid circling Rays a pictur'd  Saviour  shows  Bright It collects the Beams which trembling All  Back from the God a show'ry Radiance fall  Light'ning the Scene beneath a Scene divine  Where Saints Clouds Seraphs intermingled shine  Here Waterfalls that play melodious round  Like a sweet Organ swell a lofty Sound  The solemn Notes bid earthly Passions fly  Lull all my Cares and lift my Soul on High  This monumental Marblethis I rear  To OneOh ever mourn'dOh ever dear  He stoptpathetic Sighs the Pause supply  And the prompt Tear starts quiv'ring on his Eye  I look'dtwo Columns near the Wall were seen  An imag'd  Beauty  stretch'd at length between  Near the wept Fair her Harp  Cecilia  strung  Leaning from high a list'ning Angel hung  Friendship  whose Figure at the Feet remains  A Phoenix with irradiate Crest sustains  This grac'd one Palm while One extends t'impart  Two foreign Hands that clasp a burning Heart  A pendent Veil two hov'ring Seraphs raise  Which opening Heav'n upon the Roof displays  And two benevolent lessdistant hold  A Vase collective of Perfumes uproll'd  These from the Heart by  Friendship  held arise  Od'rous as Incense gath'ring in the Skies  In the fond Pelican is Love exprest  Who opens to her Young her tender Breast  Two mated Turtles hov'ring hang in Air  One by a Faulcon struckin wild Despair  The Hermit criesSo Death alas destroys  The tender Consort of my Cares and Joys  Again soft Tears upon his Eyelid hung  Again check'd Sounds dy'd flutt'ring on his Tongue  Too well his pining inmost Thought I know  Too well ev'n Silence tells the story'd Woe  To his my Sighs to his my Tears reply  I stray o'er all the Tomb a watry Eye  Next on the Wall her Scenes of Life I gaz'd  The Form backleaning by a Globe halfrais'd  Cherubs a proffer'd Crown of Glory show  Ey'd wistful by th' admiring Fair below  In Action eloquent dispos'd her Hands  One shows her Breast in Rapture One expands  This the fond Hermit seiz'do'er all his Soul  The soft wild wailing am'rous Rassion stole  In stedfast Gaze his Eyes her Aspect keep  Then turn away awhile dejected weep  Then he reverts 'em but reverts in vain  Dim'd with the swelling Grief that streams again  Where now is my Philosophy he cries  My Joy Hope Reason my  Olympia  dies  Why did I e'er that Prime of Blessings know  Was it ye cruel Fates t'im bitter Woe  Why wou'd your Bolts not level first  my  Head  Why must I live to weep  Olympia  dead  Sir I had once a Wife fair bloom'd her Youth  Her Form was Beauty and her Soul was Truth  Oh she was dearHow dear what Words can say  She diesMy Heav'n at once is snatch'd away  Ah what avails that by a Father's Care  I rose a wealthy and illustrious Heir  That early in my Youth I learn'd to prove  Th' instructive pleasing academic Grove  That in the Senate Eloquence was mine  That Valour gave me in the Field to shine  That Love showr'd Blessings toofar more than All  Highrapt Ambition e'er cou'd happy call  AhWhat are Thefe which ev'n the Wise adore  Lost is my Pride  Olympia  is no more  Had I ye persecuting Pow'rs been born  The World's cold Pity or at best its Scorn  Of Wealth of Rank of kindred Warmth bereft  To Want to Shame to ruthless Censure left  Patience or Pride to this Relief supplies  But a lost Wifethere there Distraction lies  Now three sad Years I yield me all to Grief  And fly the hated Comfort of Relief  Tho' rich great young I leave a pompous Seat  My Brother's now to seek some dark Retreat  Mid cloister'd solitary Tombs I stray  Despair and Horror lead the chearless Way  My Sorrow grows to such a wild Excess  Life injur'd Life must wish the Passion less  Olympia  My  Olympia  's lost I cry  Olympia  's lost the hollow Vaults reply  Louder I make my lamentable Moan  The swelling Echoes learn like me to groan  The Ghosts to scream as thro' lone Isles they sweep  The Shrines to shudder and the Saints to weep  Now Grief and Rage by gath'ring Sighs supprest  Swell my full Heart and heave my lab'ring Breast  With struggling Starts each vital String they strain  And strike the tott'ring Fabric of my Brain  O'er my sunk Spirits frowns a vap'ry Scene  Woe's dark Retreat the madding Maze of  Spleen  A deep damp Gloom o'erspreads the murky Cell  Here pining Thoughts and secret Terrors dwell  Here learn the Great unreal Wants to feign  Unpleasing Truths here mortify the Vain  Here  Learning  blinded first and then beguil'd  Looks dark as  Ignorance  as  Frenzy  wild  Here first  Credulity  on  Reason  won  And here  false Zeal  mysterious Rants begun  Here  Love  impearls each Moment with a Tear  And  Superstition  owes to  Spleen  her Fear  Fantastic Lightnings thro' the dreary Way  In swift short Signals flash the bursting Day  Above beneath across around they fly  A dire Deception strikes the mental Eye  By the Blue Fires pale Phantoms grin severe  Shrillfancied Echoes wound th' affrighted Ear  Airbanish'd Spirits flag in Fogs profound  And allobscene shed baneful Damps around  Now Whispers trembling in some feeble Wind  Sigh out prophetic Fears and freeze the Mind  Loud laughs the HagShe mocks Complaint away  Unroofs the Den and lets in more than Day  Swarms of wild  Fancies  wing'd in various Flight  Seek emblematic Shades and mystic Light  Some drive with rapid Steeds the shining Car  These nod from Thrones Those thunder in the War  Till tir'd they turn from the delusive Show  Start from wild Joy and fix in stupid Woe  Here the lone Hour a Blank of Life displays  Till now bad Thoughts a Fiend more active raise  A Fiend in evil Moments ever nigh  Death in her Hand and Frenzy in her Eye  Her Eye all red and sunkA Robe she wore  With Life's Calamities embroider'd o'er  A Mirror in one Hand collective shows  Varied and multiplied that Group of Woes  This endless Foe to gen'rous Toil and Pain  Lolls on a Couch for Ease but lolls in vain  She muses o'er her woeembroider'd Vest  And SelfAbhorrence heightens in her Breast  To shun her Care the Force of Sleep she tries  Still wakes her Mind tho' Slumbers doze her Eyes  She dreams starts rises stalks from Place to Place  With restless thoughtful interrupted Pace  Now eyes the Sun and curses ev'ry Ray  Now the green Ground where Colour fades away  Dim Spectres dance Again her Eye she rears  Then from the bloodshot Ball wipes purpled Tears  Then presses hard her Brow with Mischief fraught  Her Brow half bursts with Agony of Thought  From me she cries pale Wretch thy Comfort claim  Born of  Despair  and  Suicide  my Name  Why shou'd thy Life a Moment's Pain endure  Here ev'ry Object proffers Grief a Cure  She points where Leaves of Hemlock black'ning shoot  Fear not pluck eat said she the sov'reign Root  Then  Death  revers'd shall bear his ebon Lance  Soft o'er thy Sight shall swim the shadowy Trance  Or leap yon Rock possess a watry Grave  And leave wild Sorrow to the Wind and Wave  Or markthis Ponyard thus from Mis'ry frees  She wounds her Breastthe guilty Steel I seize  Straight where she struck a smoaking Spring of Gore  Wells from the Wound and floats the crimson'd Floor  She faints She fadesCalm Thoughts the Deed revolve  And now unstartling fix the dire Resolve  Death  drops his Terrors and with charming Wiles  Winning and kind like my  Olympia  smiles  He points the Passage to the Seats divine  Where Poets Heroes sainted Lovers shine  I come  Olympia  My rear'd Arm extends  Half to my Breast the threat'ning Point descends  Straight Thunder rocks the Land new Lightnings play  Nor tempt the Vengeance of an angry God  Nor tempt the Vengeance of an angry God  Nor tempt the Vengeance of an angry God  Fly'st thou from  Providence  for vain Relief  Such illsought Ease shall draw avenging Grief  Honour the more obstructed stronger shines  And Zeal by Persecution's Rage refines  By Woe the Soul to daring Action swells  By Woe in plaintless Patience It excels  From Patience prudent clear Experience springs  And traces Knowledge thro' the Course of Things  Thence Hope is form'd thence Fortitude Success  RenownWhate'er Men covet and caress  The vanish'd Fiend thus sent a hollow Voice  Woud'st thou be happy Straight be Death thy Choice  How mean are those who passively complain  While active Souls more free their Fetters strain  Tho' Knowledge thine Hope Fortitude Success  RenownWhate'er Men covet and caress  On Earth Success must in its Turn give way  And ev'n Perfection introduce Decay  Never the World of Spirits thustheir Rest  Untouch'd entireonce happy ever blest  Earnest the heav'nly Voice responsive cries  Oh listen not to Subtilty unwise  Thy guardian Saint who mourns thy hapless Fate  Heav'n grants to prop thy Virtue ere too late  Know if thou wilt thy dearlov'd Wife deplore  Olympia  waits thee on a foreign Shore  There in a Cell thy last Remains be spent  Away deceive Despair and find Content  I heard obey'd nor more of Fate complain'd  Long Seas I measur'd and this Mountain gain'd  Soon to a yawning Rift Chance turn'd my Way  A Den it prov'd where a huge Serpent lay  Flameey'd he layHe rages now for Food  Meets my first Glance and meditates my Blood  His Bulk in many a gather'd Orb uproll'd  Rears Spire on Spire His Scales bedropt with Gold  Shine burnish'd in the Sun Such Height they gain  They dart green Lustre on the distant Main  Now writh'd in dreadful Slope he stoops his Crest  Furious to fix on my unshielded Breast  Just as he springs my Sabre smites the Foe  Headless he falls beneath th' unerring Blow  Wrath yet remains tho' Strength his Fabric leaves  And the meant Hiss the gasping Mouth deceives  The length'ning Trunk slowloosens ev'ry Fold  Lingers in Life then stretches stiff and cold  Just as th' invet'rate Son of Mischief ends  Comes a white Dove and near the Spot descends  I hail this Omen all bad Passions cease  Like the slain  Snake  and all within is  Peace  Next to  Religion  this plain Roof I raise  In duteous Rites my hallow'd Tapers blaze  I bid due Incense on my Altar smoke  Then at this Tomb my promis'd  Love  invoke  She hearsShe comesMy Heart what Raptures warm  All my  Olympia  sparkles in the Form  No pale wan livid Mark of Death she bears  Each roseate Look a quick'ning Transport wears  A Robe of Light highwrought her Shape invests  Unzon'd the swelling Beauty of her Breasts  Her auburn Hair each flowing Ring resumes  In her fair Hand Love's Branch of Myrtle blooms  Silent awhile each wellknown Charm I trace  Then thus while nearer she avoids th' Embrace  Thou dear Deceitmust I a Shade pursue  Dazzled I gazethou swim'st before my View  Dipt in etherial Dews her Bough divine  Sprinkles my Eyes which strengthen'd bear the Shine  Still thus I urge for still the shadowy Bliss  Shuns the warm Grasp nor yields the tender Kiss  Oh fly notfade not listen to Love's Call  She livesno more I'm ManI'm Spirit all  Then let me snatch theepress theetake me whole  Oh closeyet closercloser to my Soul  Twice round her Waist my eager Arms entwin'd  And twice deceiv'd my Frenzy clasp'd the Wind  Then thus I rav'dBehold thy Husband kneel  And judge O judge what Agonies I feel  Oh be no longer if unkind thus fair  Take Horror's Shape and fright me to Despair  Rather than thus unpitying see my Moan  Far rather frown and fix me here in Stone  But mock not thusAlas the Charmer said  Smiling and in her Smile soft Radiance play'd  Alas no more eluded Strength employ  To clasp a ShadeWhat more is mortal Joy  Man's Bliss is like his Knowledge but surmis'd  One Ignorance the other Pain disguis'd  Thou wert had all thy Wish been still possest  Supreamly curst from being greatly blest  For oh so fair so dear was I to Thee  Thou hadst forgot thy God to worship me  This he foresaw and snatch'd me to the Tomb  Above I flourish in unfading Bloom  Think me not lost for thee I Heav'n implore  Thy guardian Angel tho' a Wife no more  I when abstracted from this World you seem  Hint the pure Thought and frame the heav'nly Dream  Close at thy Side when Morning streaks the Air  In Musick's Voice I wake thy Mind to Prayer  By me thy Hymns like purest Incense rise  Fragrant with Grace and pleasing to the Skies  And when that Form shall from its Clay refine  That only Bar betwixt my Soul and Thine  When thy lov'd Spirit mounts to Realms of Light  Then shall  Olympia  aid thy earliest Flight  Mingled we'll flame in Raptures that aspire  Beyond all Youth all Sense and all Desire  She ended Still such Sweetness dwells behind  Th' inchanting Voice still warbles in my Mind  But lo th' unbodied Vision fleets away  Stay my  Olympia  I conjure thee stay  Yet stayfor thee my Mem'ry learns to smart  Sure ev'ry Vein contains a bleeding Heart  Sooner shall Splendor leave the Blaze of Day  Than Love so pure so vast as mine decay  From the same heav'nly Source its Lustre came  And glows immortal with congenial Flame  Ahlet me not with Fires neglected burn  Sweet Mistress of my Soul return return  Alasshe's fledI traverse now the Place  Where my enamour'd Thoughts her Footsteps trace  Now o'er the Tomb I bend my drooping Head  There Tears the Eloquence of Sorrow shed  Sighs choak my Words unable to express  The Pangs the Throbs of speechless Tenderness  Not with more ardent more transparent Flame  Call dying Saints on their Creator's Name  Than I on her'sBut thro' yon yielding Door  Glides a new Phantom o'er th' illumin'd Floor  The Roof swiftkindles from the beaming Ground  And Floods of living Lustre flame around  In all the Majesty of Light array'd  Awful it shines'tis  Cato  's honour'd Shade  As I the Heav'nly Visitant pursue  Sublimer Glory opens to my View  He speaksBut oh what Words shall dare repeat  His ThoughtsThey leave me fir'd with Patriot Heat  More than poetic Raptures now I feel  And own that godlike Passion Publick Zeal  But from my Frailty it receives a Stain  I grow unlike my great Inspirer vain  And burn once more the busy World to know  And wou'd in Scenes of Action foremost glow  Where proud Ambition points her dazzling Rays  Where Coronets and Crowns attractive blaze  When my  Olympia  leaves the Realms above  And lures me back to solitary Love  She tells me Truth prefers an humble State  That genuine Greatness shuns the being Great  That mean are those who falseterm'd Honour prize  Whose Fabricks from their Country's Ruins rise  Who look the Traytor like the Patriot fair  Who to enjoy the Vineyard wrong the Heir  I hearthro' all my Veins new Transports roll  I gazeWarm Love comes rushing on my Soul  Ravish'd I gazeAgain her Charms decay  Again my Manhood to my Grief gives way  Cato  returnsZeal takes her Course to reign  But Zeal is in Ambition lost again  I'm now the Slave of Fondnessnow of Pride  By Turns they conquer and by Turns subside  These ballanc'd Each by Each the golden Mean  Betwixt 'em found gives Happiness serene  This I'll enjoyHe endedI replied  O Hermit thou art Worth severely tried  But had not innate Grief produc'd thy Woes  Men barb'rous Men had prey'd on thy Repose  When seeking Joy we seldom Sorrow miss  And often Mis'ry points the Path to Bliss  The Soil most worthy of the thrifty Swain  Is wounded thus e'er trusted with the Grain  The strugling Grain must work obscure its way  E'er the first Green springs upward to the Day  Upsprung such weedlike Coarseness it betrays  Flocks on th' abandon'd Blade permissive graze  Then shoots the Wealth from Imperfection clear  And thus a grateful Harvest crowns the Year  The END of the SECOND CANTO  THE WANDERER A VISION  CANTO III  _THUS free our social Time from Morning flows  'Till rising Shades attempt the Day to close  Thus my new Friend Behold the Light's Decay  Back to

Night away  Yon Nymphs and Swains in am'rous Mirth advance  To breathing Musick moves the circling Dance  Here the bold Youth in Deeds adventrous glow  Skimming in rapid Sleds the crackling Snow  Not when  Tidides  won the fun'ral Race  Shot his light Car along in swifter Pace  Here the glaz'd Way with Iron Feet they dare  And glide wellpois'd like  Mercuries  in Air  There Crouds with stable Tread and levell'd Eye  Lift and dismiss the Quoits that whirling fly  With Force superior not with Skill so true  The pond'rous Disk from  Roman  Sinews flew  Where neighb'ring Hills some cloudy Sheet sustain  Freez'd o'er the nether Vale a pensile Plain  Cross the roof'd Hollow rolls the massy Round  The crack'd Ice rattles and the Rocks resound  Censures Disputes and Laughs alternate rise

And Myriads grow by thy Example Great  Hark from the WatchTow'r rolls the Trumpet's Sound  Sweet thro' still Night proclaiming Safety round  Yon Shade illustrious quits the Realms of Rest  To aid some Orphan of its Race distrest  Safe winds him thro' the subterraneous Way  That mines yon Mansion grown with Ruin grey  And marks the wealthy unsuspected Ground  Where green with Rust longburied Coins abound  This plaintive Ghost from Earth when newly fled  Saw those the Living trusted wrong the Dead  He saw by Fraud abus'd the lifeless Hand  Sign the false Deed that alienates his Land  Heard on his Fame injurious Censure thrown  And mourn'd the beggar'd Orphan's bitter Groan  Commission'd now the Falshood He reveals  To Justice soon th'enabled Heir appeals  Soon by this Wealth are costly Pleas maintain'd  And by discover'd Truth lost Right regain'd  But why may some enquire why kind Success  Since mystic Heav'n gives Mis'ry oft to bless  Tho' Mis'ry leads to Happiness and Truth  Unequal to the Load this languid Youth  Unstrengthen'd Virtue scarce his Bosom fir'd  And fearful from his growing Wants retir'd  Oh let none censure if untried by Grief  If amidst Woe untempted by Relief  He stoop'd reluctant to low Arts of Shame  Which then ev'n then he scorn'd and blush'd to name  Heav'n sees and makes th'imperfect Worth its Care  And chears the trembling Heart unform'd to bear  Now rising Fortune elevates his Mind  He shines unclouded and adorns Mankind  So in some Engine that denies a Vent  If unrespiring is some Creature pent  It sickens droops and pants and gasps for Breath  Sad o'er the Sight swim shad'wy Mists of Death  If then kind Air pours pow'rful in again  New Heats new Pulses quicken ev'ry Vein  From the clear'd lifted liferekindled Eye  Dispers'd the dark and dampy Vapours fly  From trembling Tombs the Ghosts of Greatness rise  And o'er their Bodies hang with wistful Eyes  Or discontented stalk and mix their Howls  With howling Wolves their Screams with screaming Owls  The Interval 'twixt Night and Morn is nigh  Winter more nitrous chills the shadow'd Sky  Springs with soft Heats no more give Borders green  Nor smoaking breathe along the whiten'd Scene  While steamy Currents sweet in Prospect charm  Like Veins bluewinding on a Fairone's Arm  Now  Sleep  to  Fancy  parts with half his Pow'r  And broken Slumbers drag the restless Hour  The Murder'd seems alive and ghastly glares  And in dire Dreams the conscious Murd'rer scares  Shews the yetspouting Wound th'ensanguin'd Floor  The Walls yetsmoaking with the spatter'd Gore  Or shrieks to dozing Justice and reveals  The Deed which fraudful Art from Day conceals  The Delve obscene where no Suspicion pries  Where the disfigur'd Coarse unshrouded lies  The sure the striking Proof so strong maintain'd  Pale Guilt starts selfconvicted when arraign'd  These Spirits Treason of its Pow'r divest  And turn the Peril from the Patriot's Breast  Those solemn Thought inspire or bright descend  To snatch in Vision sweet the dying Friend  But we deceive the Gloom the Matin Bell  Summons to PrayerNow breaks th' Inchanter's Spell  And nowBut yon fair Spirit's Form survey  'Tis she  Olympia  beckons me away  I haste I flyadieuand when you see  The Youth who bleeds with Fondness think on me  Tell him my Tale and be his Pain carest  By Love I tortur'd was by Love I'm blest  When worship'd Woman we entranc'd behold  We praise the Maker in his fairest Mold  The Pride of Nature Harmony combin'd  And Light immortal to the Soul refin'd  Depriv'd of charming Woman soon we miss  The Prize of Friendship and the Life of Bliss  Still thro' the Shades  Olympia  dawning breaks  What Bloom what Brightness lusters o'er her Cheeks  Again she callsI dare no longer stay  A kind

unfolding Spring of rich Perfumes  Shakes the slowcircling Blood of human Race  And in sharp livid Looks contracts the Face  Now o'er  Norwegian  Hills he strides away  Such slipp'ry Paths  Ambition  's Steps betray  Turning with Sighs far spiral Firs he sees  Which bow obedient to the Southern Breeze  Now from yon  Zemblan  Rock his Crest he shrouds  Like  Fame  's obscur'd amid the whitening Clouds  Thence his lost Empire is with Tears deplor'd  Such Tyrants shed o'er Liberty restor'd  Beneath his Eye that throws malignant Light  Ten Times the measur'd Round of mortal Sight  A waste paleglimm'ring like a Moon that wanes  A wild Expanse of frozen Sea contains  It cracks vast floating Mountains beat the Shore  Far off he hears those icy Ruins roar  And from the hideous Crash distracted flies  Like One who feels his dying Infant's Cries  Near and more near the rushing Torrents sound  And one great Rift runs thro' the vast Profound  Swift as a shooting Meteor groaning loud  Like deeproll'd Thunder thro' a rending Cloud  The latedark  Pole  now feels unsetting Day  In Hurricanes of Wrath he whirls his Way  O'er many a polar  Alp  to  Frost  he goes  O'er crackling Vales embrown'd with melting Snows  Here Bears stalk Tenants of the barren Space  Few Men unsocial Thosea barb'rous Race  At length the Cave appears the Race is run  Now he recounts vast Conquests lost and won  And taleful in th'Embrace of  Frost  remains  Barr'd from our Climes and bound in icy Chains  Mean while the Sun his Beams on  Cancer  throws  Which now beneath his warmest Influence glows  From glowing  Cancer  fall'n the King of Day  Red thro' the kindling  Lyon  shoots his Ray  The tawny Harvest pays the earlier Plough  And mellowing Fruitage loads the bending Bough  'Tis Dayspring Now green Lab'rinths I frequent  Where  Wisdom  oft retires to meet  Content  The mounting Lark her warbling Anthem lends  From Note to Note the ravish'd Soul ascends  As thus it wou'd the Patriarch's Ladder climb  By some good Angel led to Worlds sublime  Oft Legends say the Snake with waken'd Ire  Like  Envy  rears in many a scaly Spire  Then Songsters drop then yield their vital Gore  And Innocence and Musick are no more  Mild rides the Morn in orient Beauty drest  An azure Mantle and a purple Vest  Which blown by Gales her gemmy Feet display  Her amber Tresses negligently gay  Collected now her rosy Hand they fill  And gently wrung the pearly Dews distill  The songful Zephyrs and the laughing Hours  Breathe sweet and strew her opening Way with Flowers  The chatt'ring Swallows leave their nested Care  Each promising Return with plenteous Fare  So the fond Swain who to the Market hies  Stills with big Hopes his Infant's tender Cries  Yonder two Turtles o'er their

Hollows carv'd for Snakes and Birds obscene  O  Gibbs  whose Art the solemn Fane can raise  Where  God  delights to dwell and  Man  to praise  When moulder'd thus the Column falls away  Like some great Prince majestic in Decay  When  Ignorance  and  Scorn  the Ground shall tread  Where  Wisdom  tutor'd and  Devotion  pray'd  Where shall thy pompous Work our Wonder claim  What but the  Muse  alone preserve thy Name  The Sun shines broken thro' yon Arch that rears  This onceround Fabric halfdepriv'd by Years  Which rose a stately Colonade and crown'd  Encircling Pillars now unfaithful found  In Fragments these the Fall of those forebode  Which nodding just upheave their crumbling Load  High on yon Column which has batter'd stood  Like some stripp'd Oak the Grandeur of the Wood  The Stork inhabits her a√´rial Nest  By her are Liberty and Peace carest  She flies the Realms that own despotick Kings  And only spreads o'er freeborn States her Wings  The Roof is now the Daw's or Raven's Haunt  And loathsome Toads in the dark Entrance pant  Or Snakes that lurk to snap the heedless Fly  And fated Bird that oft comes flutt'ring by  An Aqueduct across yon Vale is laid  It's

 Close in deep Glooms or open clear in Glades  Or where surrounding Vistas far descend  The Landscape varied at each less'ning End  She  only  She  can mortal Thought refine  And raise thy Voice to Visitants divine  END of the FOURTH CANTO  THE WANDERER A VISION  CANTO V  _WE left the Cave Be Fear said I defied  Virtue for thou art Virtue is my Guide  By timeworn Steps a steep Ascent we gain  Whose Summit yields a Prospect o'er the Plain  There bench'd with Turf an Oak our Seat extends  Whose Top a verdant branch'd Pavilion bends  Vistas with Leaves diversify the Scene  Some pale some brown and some of lively green  Now from the fullgrown Day a beamy Shower  Gleams on the Lake and gilds each glossy Flower  Gay Insects sparkle in the genial Blaze  Various as Light and countless as its Rays  They dance on ev'ry Stream and pictur'd play  Till by the watry Racer snatch'd away  Now from yon Range of Rocks strong Rays rebound  Doubling the Day on flow'ry Plains around  Kingcups  beneath farstriking Colours glance  Bright as th'etherial glows the green Expanse  Gems of the Fieldthe  Topaz  charms the Sight  Like these effulging yellow Streams of Light  From the same Rocks fall Rills with soften'd Force  Meet in yon Mead and well a River's Source  Thro' her clear Chanel shine her finny Shoals  O'er Sands like Gold the liquid Crystal rolls  Dim'd in yon coarser Moor her Charms decay  And shape thro' rustling Reeds a ruffled Way  Near Willows short and bushy Shadows throw  Now lost she seems thro' nether Tracts to flow  Yet at yon Point winds out in Silver State  Like Virtue from a Labyrinth of Fate  In length'ning Rows prone from the Mountains run  The Flockstheir Fleeces glist'ning in the Sun  Her Streams they seek and 'twixt her neighb'ring Trees  Recline in various Attitudes of Ease  Where the Herds sip the little scaly Fry  Swift from the Shore in scatt'ring Myriads fly  Each liv'ried Cloud that round th' Horizonglows  Shifts in odd Scenes like Earth from whence it rose  The Bee hums wanton in yon Jess'mine Bower  And circling settles and despoils the Flower  Melodious there the plumy Songsters meet  And call charm'd  Echo  from her arch'd Retreat  Neat polish'd Mansions rise in Prospect gay  Timebatter'd Tow'rs frown awful in Decay  The Sun plays glitt'ring on the Rocks and Spires  And the Lawn lightens with reflected Fires  Here  Mirth  and  Fancy  's wanton Train advance  And to light Measures turn the swimming Dance  Sweet slowpac'd  Melancholy  next appears  Pompous in Grief and Eloquent of Tears  Here  Meditation  shines in Azure drest  Allstarr'd with Gems A Sun adorns her Crest  Religion  to whose lifted raptur'd Eyes  Seraphic Hosts descend from opening Skies  Beauty  who sways the Heart and charms the Sight  Whose Tongue is Music and whose Smile Delight  Whose Brow is Majesty whose Bosom Peace  Who bad Creation be and Chaos cease  Whose Breath perfumes the Spring whose Eye divine  Kindled the Sun and gave its Light to shine  Here in thy Likeness fair  Mrs  Oldfield  Ophelia  seen  She throws kind Lustre o'er th' enliven'd Green  Next her  Description  robed in various Hues  Invites Attention from the pensive  Muse  The  Muse  she comes refin'd the  Passions  wait  And  Precept  ever winning wise and great  The  Muse  a thousand  Spirits  wing the Air  Once  Men  who made like  her  Mankind their Care  Inamour'd round her press th'inspiring Throng  And swell to Extacy her solemn Song  Thus in the Dame each nobler Grace we find  Fair  Wortley  's angelAccent Eyes and Mind  Whether her Sight the dewbright Dawn surveys  The Noon's dry Heat or Evening's temper'd Rays  The Hours of Storm or Calm the gleby Ground  The corral'd Sea gem'd Rock or Sky prosound  A  Raphael  's Fancy animates each Line  Each Image strikes with Energy divine  Bacon  and  Newton  in her Thought conspire  Not sweeter than her Voice is  Hendel  's Lyre  My Hermit thus She beckons us away  Oh let us swift the high Behest obey  Now thro' a Lane which mingling Tracts have crost  The Way unequal and the Landscape lost  We rove The Warblers lively Tunes essay  The  Lark  on Wing the  Linnet  on the Spray  While Music trembles in their songful Throats  The  Bullfinch  whistles soft his flutelike Notes  The bolder  Blackbird  swells sonorous Lays  The varying  Thrush  commands a tuneful Maze  Each a wild Length of Melody pursues  While the softmurm'ring am'rous  WoodDove  cooes  And when in Spring these melting Mixtures flow  The  Cuckoo  sends her Unison of Woe  But as smooth Seas are surrow'd by a Storm  As Troubles all our tranquil Joys deform  So loud thro' Air unwelcome Noises sound  And Harmony's at once in Discord drown'd  From yon dark Cypress croaks the Raven's Cry  As dissonant the  Daw Jay  chatt'ring  Pye  The clam'rous  Crows  abandon'd Carnage seek  And the harsh  Owl  shrills out a sharp'ning Shriek  At the Lane's End a highlath'd Gate's prefer'd  To bar the Trespass of a vagrant Herd  Fast by a meagre Mendicant we find  Whose russet Rags hang flutt'ring in the Wind  Years bow his Back a Staff supports his Tread  And soft white Hairs shade thin his palsied Head  Poor WretchIs this for Charity

His our first Sire what Race more ancient thine  Less backward trac'd he may his Lineage draw  From Men whose Influence kept the World in awe  Whose worthless Sons like thee perchance consum'd  Their ample Store their Line to Want was doom'd  So thine may perish by the course of Things  While his from Beggers reascend to Kings  Now  Lazar  as thy Hardships I peruse  On my own State instructed wou'd I muse  When I view Greatness I my Lot lament  Compar'd to thee I snatch supreme Content  I might have felt did Heav'n not gracious deal  A Fate which I must mourn to see thee feel  But soft the Cripple our Approach descries  And to the Gate tho' weak officious hies  I spring preventive and unbar the Way  Then turning with a Smile of Pity say  Here Friendthis little copper Alms receive  Instance of Will without the Pow'r to give  Hermit if here with Pity we reflect  How must we grieve when Learning meets Neglect  When Godlike Souls endure a mean Restraint  When gen'rous Will is curb'd by tyrant Want  He truly feels what to Distress belongs  Who to his private adds a People's Wrongs  Merit's a Mark at which Disgrace is thrown  And ev'ry injur'd Virtue is his own  Such their own Pangs with Patience here endure  Yet there weep Wounds they are denied to cure  Thus rich in Poverty thus humbly Great  And tho' depress'd superior to their Fate  Minions in Pow'r and Misers mid their Store  Are mean in Greatness and in Plenty poor  What's Pow'r or Wealth Were they not form'd for Aid  A Spring for Virtue and from Wrongs a Shade  In Pow'r we salvage Tyranny behold  And wily Av'rice owns polluted Gold  From golden Sands her Pride cou'd  Lybia  raise  Cou'd she who spreads no Pasture claim our Praise  Loath'd were her Wealth where rabid Monsters breed  Where Serpents pamper'd on her Venom feed  No sheltry Trees invite the Wand'rer's Eye  No Fruits no Grain no Gums her Tracts supply  On her vast Wilds no lovely Prospects run  But all lies barren tho' beneath the Sun  My Hermit thus I know thy Soul believes  'Tis hard Vice triumphs and that Virtue grieves  Yet oft Affliction purifies the Mind  Kind Benefits oft flow from Means unkind  Were the whole known what we uncouth suppose  Doubtless wou'd beauteous Symmetry disclose  The naked Cliff that singly rough remains  In Prospect dignifies the fertile Plains  Leadcolour'd Clouds in scatt'ring Fragments seen  Shew tho' in broken Views the blue serene  Severe Distresses Industry inspire  Thus Captives oft excelling Arts acquire  And boldly struggle thro' a State of Shame  To Life Ease Plenty Liberty and

Blasts that strip the Autumn bring  The milder Beauties of a flow'ry Spring  Ye sulph'rous Fires in jaggy Lightnings break  Ye Thunders rattle and ye Nations shake  Ye Storms of riving Flame the Forest tear  Deep crack ye Rocks rent Trees be whirl'd in Air  Reft at a Stroke some stately Fane we'll mourn  Her Tombs wideshatter'd and her Dead uptorn  Were noxious Spirits not from Caverns drawn  Rack'd Earth wou'd soon in Gulphs enormous yawn  Then all were lostOr shou'd we floating view  The baleful Cloud there wou'd Destruction brew  Plague Fever Frenzy closeengend'ring lie  'Till these red Ruptures clear the sullied Sky  Now a Field opens to enlarge my Thought  In parcell'd Tracts to various Uses wrought  Here hard'ning Ripeness the first Blooms behold  There the last Blossoms

array'd  Full in the midst starts up a silky Shade  For human Taste the rich'dstain'd Fruitage bleeds  The Leaf the silkemitting Reptile feeds  As Swans their Down as Flocks their Fleeces leave  Here Worms for Man their glossy Entrails weave  Hence to adorn the Fair in Texture gay  Sprigs Fruits and Flow'rs on figur'd Vestments play  But  Industry  prepares them oft to please  The guilty Pride of vain luxuriant Ease  Now frequent dusty Gales offensive blow  And o'er my Sight a transient Blindness throw  Windward we shift Near down th'etherial Steep  The Lamp of Day hangs hov'ring o'er the Deep  Dun Shades in rocky Shapes up Ether roll'd  Project long shaggy Points deepting'd with Gold  Others take faint th'unripen'd Cherry's Die  And paint amusing Landscapes on the Eye  There blueveil'd Yellow thro' a Sky serene  In swelling Mixture forms a floating Green  Streak'd thro' white Clouds a mild Vermilion shines  And the Breeze freshens as the Heat declines  Yon crooked sunny Roads change rising Views  From brown to sandyred and chalky Hues  One mingled Scene another quick succeeds  Men Chariots Teams yok'd Steers and prancing Steeds  Which climb descend and as loud Whips resound  Stretch sweat and smoke along unequal Ground  On winding  Thames  reflecting radiant Beams  When Boats Ships Barges mark the roughen'd Streams  This Way and that they diff'rent Points pursue  So mix the Motions and so shifts the View  While thus we throw around our gladden'd Eyes  The Gifts of Heav'n in gay Profusion rise  Trees rich with Gums and Fruits with Jewels Rocks  Plains with Flow'rs Herbs and Plants and Beeves and Flocks  Mountains with Mines with Oak and Cedar Woods  Quarries with Marble and with Fish the Floods  In dark'ning Spots mid Fields of various Dies  Tilth newmanur'd or

in yon Heath oppos'd the cultur'd Scene  Wild Thyme pale Box and Firs of darker green  The native Strawberry redripening grows  By Nettles guarded as by Thorns the Rose  There Nightingales in unprun'd Copses build  In shaggy Furzes lies the Hare conceal'd  'Twixt Ferns and Thistles unsown Flow'rs amuse  And form a lucid Chase of various Hues  Many halfgrey with Dust Confus'd they lie  Scent the rich Year and lead the wand'ring Eye  Contemplative we tread the flow'ry Plain  The  Muse  preceding with her heav'nly Train  When lo the Mendicant so late behind  Strange View now journeying in our Front we find  And yet a View more strange our Heed demands  Touch'd by the Muse's Wand transform'd he stands  O'er Skin latewrinkled instant Beauty spreads  The latedimm'd Eye a vivid Lustre sheds  Hairs once so thin now graceful Locks decline  And Rags now chang'd in regal Vestments shine  The Hermit thus In him the  BARD  behold  Once seen by Midnight's Lamp in Winter's Cold  The  Bard  whose Want so multiplied his Woes  He sunk a Mortal and a Seraph rose  Seewhere those stately YewTrees darkling grow  And waving o'er yon Graves brown Horrors throw  Scornful he pointsthere o'er his sacred Dust  Arise the sculptur'd Tomb and labour'd Bust  Vain Pomp bestow'd by ostentatious Pride  Who to a Life of Want Relief deny'd  But thus the  Bard  Are these the Gifts of State  Gifts unreceiv'dThese Ye ungen'rous Great  How was I treated when in Life forlorn  My Claim your Pity but my Lot your Scorn  Why were my studious Hours oppos'd by Need  In me did Poverty from Guilt proceed  Did I contemporary Authors wrong  And deem their Worth but as they priz'd my Song  Did I sooth Vice or venal Strokes betray  In the lowpurpos'd loud polemic Fray  Did e'er my Verse immodest Warmth contain  Or once licentious heav'nly Truths prophane  NeverAnd yet when Envy sunk my Name  Who call'd my shadow'd Merit into Fame  When undeserv'd a Prison's Grate I saw  What Hand redeem'd me from the wrested Law  Who cloath'd me naked or when hungry fed  Why crush'd the Living Why extoll'd the Dead  But foreign Languages adopt my Lays  And distant Nations shame you into Praise  Why shou'd  unrelish'd  Wit these Honours cause  Custom not Knowledge dictates your Applause  Or think you thus a selfRenown to raise  And mingle your VainGlories with my Bays  Be Your's the mould'ring Tomb Be mine the Lay  ImmortalThus he scoffs the Pomp away  Tho' Words like these unletter'd Pride impeach  To the meek Heart he turns with milder Speech  Tho' now a Seraph oft he deigns to wear  The Face of human Friendship oft of Care  To walk disguis'd an Object of Relief  A learn'd good Man long exercis'd in Grief  Forlorn a friendless Orphan oft to roam  Craving some kind some hospitable Home  Or like  Ulysses  a low Lazar stand  Beseeching Pity's Eye and Bounty's Hand  Or like  Ulysses  Royal Aid request  Wand'ring from Court to Court a King distrest  Thus varying Shapes the seeming Son of Woe  Eyes the cold Heart and Hearts that gen'rous glow  Then to the  Muse  relates each lordly Name  Who deals impartial Infamy and Fame  Oft as when Man in mortal State depress'd  His Lays taught Virtue which his Life confess'd  He now forms visionary Scenes below  Inspiring Patience in the Heart of Woe  Patience that softens every sad Extreme  That casts thro' DungeonGlooms a chearful Gleam  Disarms Disease of Pain mocks Slander's Sting  And strips of Terrors the terrific King  'Gainst  Want  a sourer Foe its Succour lends  And smiling sees th' Ingratitude of Friends  Nor are these Tasks

of missionary Seraphs glide  She sees good Angels genial Show'rs bestow  From the red Convex of the dewy Bow  They smile upon the Swain He views the Prize  Then grateful bends to bless the bounteous Skies  Some collect Winds and send propitious Gales  Oft where  Britannia  's Navy spreads her Sails  There ever wafting on the Breath of Fame  Unequal'd Glory in her  Sovereign  's Name  Some teach young Zephyrs vernal Sweets to bear  And float the balmy Health on ambient Air  Zephyrs that oft where Lovers list'ning lie  Along the Grove in melting Music die  And in lone Caves to Minds poetic

Yellow  's gilding Rays  The clouded  Orange  that betwixt them grows  And to kind Mixture tawny Lustre owes  Allchearing  Green  that gives the Spring its Dye  The bright transparent  Blue  that

Lines of Light  When blended dazzling in promiscuous  White  Oft thro' these Bows departed Spirits range  New to the Skies admiring at their Change  Each Mind a Void as when firstborn to Earth  Beheld a second Blank in second Birth  Then as yon  SeraphBard  fram'd Hearts below  Each sees him here transcendant Knowledge show  New Saints he tutors into Truth refin'd  And tunes to rapt'rous Love the newform'd Mind  He swells the Lyre whose loud melodious Lays  Call high  Hosannahs  from the Voice of Praise  Tho' one bad Age such Po√´sy cou'd wrong  Now Worlds around retentive roll the Song  Now God's high Throne the fullvoic'd Raptures gain  Coelestial Hosts returning Strain for Strain  Thus he who once knew Want without Relief  Sees Joy resulting from wellsuff'ring Grief  Hark while we talk

their Hope destroys  Discord  she wills the missile Ruin flies  Sudden unnatural Debates arise  Doubt mutual Jealousy and dumb Disgust  Darkhinted Mutt'rings and avow'd Distrust  To secret Ferment is each Heart resign'd  Suspicion hovers in each clouded Mind  They jar accus'd accuse revil'd revile  And Wrath to Wrath oppose and Guile to Guile  Wrangling they part themselves themselves betray  Each

ought of Life nor ought of Death he knows  Till Thought returns and brings Return of Woes  Now pours a Storm of Grief in gushing Streams  That pastCollected in himself he seems  And with forc'd Smile retiresHis latent Thought  Dark horrid as the Prison's dismal Vault  If with himself at Variance everwild  With angry Heav'n how stands he reconcil'd  No penitential Orisons arise  Nay he obtests the

Floors  To Thoughts more dissonant far far less kind  One  Anarchy  one  Chaos  of the  Mind  At length fatigu'd with Grief on Earth he lies  But soon as Sleep weighs down th'unwilling Eyes  Glad Liberty appears no Damps annoy  Treason succeeds and all transforms to Joy  Proud Palaces their glitt'ring Stores display  Gain he pursues and Rapine leads the Way  What Gold What GemsHe strains to

DungeonGlooms hang heavy on his Mind  Shrill Winds are heard and howling Daemons call  Wideflying Portals seem unhing'd to fall  Then close with sudden Claps a dreadful Din  He starts wakes storms and all is Hell within  His Genius fliesreflects he now on Prayer  Alas bad Spirits turn those Thoughts to Air  What shall he next What straight relinquish Breath  To bar a publick just tho' shameful Death  Rash horrid Thought yet now afraid to live  Murd'rous he strikesMay Heav'n the Deed forgive  Why had he thus false Spirit to rebel  And why not Fortitude to suffer well  Were his Success how terrible the Blow  And its Recoil on him eternal Woe  Heav'n this Affliction then for Mercy meant  That a good End might close a Life mispent  Where no kind Lips the hallow'd Dirge resound  Far from the Compass of yon sacred Ground  Full in the Center of three meeting Ways  Stak'd thro' he liesWarn'd let the Wicked gaze  Near yonder Fane where Mis'ry sleeps in Peace  Whose Spire fastlessens as these Shades encrease  Left to the North whence oft brew'd Tempests roll  Tempests dire Emblems  Cosmo  of thy Soul  There mark that  Cosmo  much for Guile renown'd  His Grave by unbid Plants of Poison crown'd  When out of Pow'r thro' him the Publick Good  So strong his factious Tribe suspended stood  In Pow'r vindictive Actions were his Aim  And Patriots perish'd by th' ungenerous Flame  If the best Cause he in the Senate chose  Ev'n Right in him from some wrong Motive rose  The Bad he loath'd and wou'd the Weak despise  Yet courted for dark Ends and shun'd the Wise  When ill his Purpose eloquent his Strain  His Malice had a Look and Voice humane  His Smile the Signal of some vile Intent  A private Ponyard or empoison'd Scent  Proud yet to popular Applause a Slave  No Friend he honour'd and no Foe forgave  His Boons unfrequent or unjust to Need  The Hire of Guilt of Infamy the Meed  But if they chanc'd on Learned Worth to fall  Bounty in him was Ostentation all  No true Benevolence his Thought sublimes  His noblest Actions are illustrious Crimes  Fine Parts which Virtue might have rank'd with Fame  Enhance his Guilt and magnify his Shame  When Parts and Probity in Man combine  In Wisdom's Eye How charming must he shine  Let him less happy Truth at least impart  And what he wants in Genius bear in Heart  Cosmo  as Death draws nigh no more conceals  That Storm of Passions which his Nature feels  He feels much Fear more Anger and most Pride  But Pride and Anger make all Fear subside  Dauntless He meets at length untimely Fate  A desp'rate Spirit rather Fierce than Great  Darkling he glides along the dreary Coast  A sullen wand'ring selftormenting Ghost  Where veiny Marble dignifies the Ground  With Emblem fair in Sculpture rising round  Just where a crossing length'ning Isle we find  Full East whence God returns to judge Mankind  Oncelov'd  Horatio  sleeps a Mind elate  Lamented Shade  Ambition  was thy Fate  Ev'n Angels wond'ring oft his Worth survey'd  Behold a Man like One of Us  they said  Straight heard the Furies and with Envy glar'd  And to precipitate his Fall prepar'd  First  Av'rice  came In vain SelfLove she press'd  The Poor he pitied still and still redress'd  Learning was his and Knowledge to commend  Of Arts a Patron and of Want a Friend  Next came  Revenge  But her Essay how vain  Nor Hate nor Envy in his Heart remain  No previous Malice cou'd his Mind engage  Malice the Mother of vindictive Rage  Nofrom his Life his Foes might learn to live  He held it still a Triumph to forgive  At length  Ambition  urg'd his Country's Weal  Assuming the fair Look of publick  Zeal  Still in his Breast so gen'rous glow'd the Flame  The Vice when there a Virtue half became  His pitying Eye saw Millions in Distress  He deem'd it Godlike to have Pow'r to bless  Thus when unguarded Treason stain'd him o'er  And Virtue and Content were then no more  But when to Death by rig'rous Justice doom'd  His genuine Spirit Saintlike State resum'd  Oft from soft Penitence distill'd a Tear  Oft Hope in heav'nly Mercy lighten'd Fear  Oft wou'd a Drop from strugling Nature fall  And then a Smile of Patience brighten all  He seeks in Heav'n a Friend nor seeks in vain  His guardian Angel swift descends again  And Resolution thus bespeaks a Mind  Not scorning Life yet all to Death resign'd  Ye Chains fit only to restrain the Will  Of common desp'rate Veterans in Ill  Tho' rankling on my Limbs ye lie declare  Did e'er my rising Soul your Pressure wear  Nofree as Liberty and quick as Light  To Worlds remote she takes unbounded Flight  Ye DungeonGlooms that dim corporeal Eyes  Cou'd ye once blot her Prospect of the Skies  Nofrom her clearer Sight ye fled away  Like Error pierc'd by Truths resistless Ray  Ye Walls that

how willing glides my parting Breath  Far greater better farAy sar indeed  Like me  have  suffer'd and like me  will  bleed  Apostles Patriarchs Prophets Martyrs all  Like me once fell nor murmur'd at their Fall  Shall I whose Days at best no Ill design'd  Whose Virtue shone not tho' I lov'd Mankind  Shall I now guilty Wretch shall I repine  Ah no to Justice let me Life resign  Quick as a Friend wou'd I embrace my Foe  He taught me Patience who first taught me Woe  But Friends are Foes they render Woe severe  For me they wail from me extort the Tear  Not those yetabsent missive Griefs controul  These Periods weep those rave and these condole  At Entrance shrieks a Friend with pale Surprize  Another panting prostrate speechless lies  One gripes my Hand one sobs upon my Breast  Ah who can bearIt shocks it murders Rest  And is it your's alas my Friends to feel  And is it mine to comfort mine to heal  Is mine the Patience your's the Bosomstrife  Ah wou'd rash Love lure back my Thoughts to Life  Adieu dear dang'rous Mourners swift depart  Ah fly me flyI tear ye from my Heart  Ye Saints whom Fears of Death cou'd ne'er controul  In my last Hour compose support my Soul  See my Blood wash repented Sin away  Receive receive me to eternal Day  With Words like these the destin'd Hero dies  While Angels waft his Soul to happier Skies  Distinction now gives way yet on we talk  Full Darkness deep'ning o'er the formless Walk  Night  treads not with light Step the dewy Gale  Nor brightdistends her Starembroider'd Veil  Her leaden Feet inclement Damps distill  Clouds shut her Face black Winds her Vesture fill  An Earthborn Meteor lights the sable Skies  Eastward it shoots and sunk forgotten dies  So Pride that rose from Dust to guilty Pow'r  Glares out in vain so Dust shall Pride devour  Fishers who yonder Brink by Torches gain  With teethful Tridents strike the scaly Train  Like Snakes in Eagles' Claws in vain they strive  When heav'd aloft and quiv'ring yetalive  While here methought our Time in Converse pass'd  The Moon Clouds muffl'd and the Night wore fast  At prowling Wolves was heard the Mastiff's Bay  And the warn'd Master's Arms forbad the Prey  Thus Treason steals the Patriot thus descries  Forthsprings the Monarch and the Mischief flies  Pale Glowworms glimmer'd thro' the Depth of Night  Scatt'ring like Hope thro' Fear a doubtful Light  Lone  Philomela  tun'd the silent Grove  With pensive Pleasure listen'd wakeful  Love  Halfdreaming  Fancy  form'd an Angel's Tongue  And  Pain  forgot to groan so sweet she sung  The  NightCrone  with the Melody alarm'd  Now paus'd now listen'd and awhile was charm'd  But like the Man whose frequentstubborn Will  Resists what kind seraphic Sounds instill  Her Heart the Loveinspiring Voice repell'd  Her Breast with agitating Mischief swell'd  Which clos'd her Ear and tempted to destroy  The tuneful Life that charms with vertuous Joy  Now fast we measure back the trackless Way  No friendly Stars directive Beams display  But loa thousand Lights shoot instant Rays  Yon kindling Rock reflects the startling Blaze  I stand astonish'dthus the Hermit cries  Fear not but listen with enlarg'd Surprize  Still must these Hours our mutual Converse claim  And cease to echo still  Olympia  's Name  Grots Riv'lets Groves  Olympia  's Name forget  Olympia  now no sighing Winds repeat  Can I be mortal and those Hours no more  Those am'rous Hours that plaintive Echo's bore  Am I the same Ah noBehold a Mind  Unruffl'd firm exalted and refin'd  Late Months that made the vernal Season gay  Saw my Health languish off in pale Decay  No racking Pain yet gave Disease a Date  No sad presageful Thought preluded Fate  Yet number'd were my DaysMy destin'd End  Near and more nearNay ev'ry Fear suspend  I pass'd a weary ling'ring sleepless Night  Then rose to walk in Morning's earliest Light  But few my StepsA faint and chearless few  Refreshment from my flagging Spirits flew  When lo retir'd beneath a Cypress Shade  My Limbs upon a flow'ry Bank I laid  Soon by softcreeping murm'ring Winds compos'd  A Slumber press'd my languid Eyesthey clos'd  But clos'd not longmethought  Olympia  spoke  Thrice loud she call'd and thrice the Slumber broke  I wak'd Forthgliding from a neighb'ring Wood  Full in my View the shad'wy Charmer stood  Rapt'rous I started up to clasp the Shade  But stagger'd fell and found my Vitals fade  A mantling Chilness o'er my Bosom spread  As if that Instant number'd with the Dead  Her Voice now sent a far imperfect Sound  When in a swimming Trance my Pangs were drown'd  Still farther off she call'dwith soft Surprize  I turn'dbut void of Strength and Aid to rise  Short shorter shorter yet my Breath I drew  Then up my struggling Soul unburthen'd flew  Thus from a State where Sin and Grief abide  Heav'n summon'd me to Mercythus I died  He said Th' Astonishment with which I start  Like bolted Ice runs shiv'ring thro' my Heart  Art thou not mortal then I cried But lo  His Raiment lightens and his Features glow  In shady Ringlets falls a Length of Hair  Embloom'd his Aspect shines enlarg'd his Air  Mild from his Eyes enliv'ning Glories beam  Mild on his Brow sits Majesty supreme  Bright Plumes of ev'ry Die that round him flow  Vest Robe and Wings in varied Lustre show  He looks and forward steps with Mien Divine  A Grace celestial gives him all to shine  He speaksNature is ravish'd at the Sound  The Forests move and Streams stand list'ning round  Thus He As Incorruption I assum'd  As instant in immortal Youth I bloom'd  Renew'd and chang'd I felt my vital Springs  With diff'rent Lights discern'd the Form of Things  To Earth my Passions fell like Mists away  And Reason open'd in eternal Day  Swifter than Thought from World to World I flew  Celestial Knowledge shone in ev'ry View  My Food was Truthwhat Transport cou'd I miss  My Prospect all Infinitude of Bliss  Olympia  met me first and smiling Gay  Onward to Mercy led the shining Way  As far transcendant to her wonted Air  As her dear wonted self to many a Fair  In Voice and Form Beauty more beauteous shows  And Harmony still more harmonious grows  She points out Souls who taught me Friendship's Charms  They gaze they glow they spring into my Arms  Wellpleas'd high Ancestors my View command  Patrons and Patriots all a glorious Band  Horatio  too by wellborne Fate refin'd  Shone out whiterob'd with Saints a spotless Mind  What once below Ambition made him miss  Humility here gain'd a Life of Bliss  Tho' late let Sinners then from Sin depart  Heav'n never yet despis'd the contrite Heart  Last shone with sweet exalted Lustre grac'd  The  SERAPHBARD  in highest Order plac'd  Scers Lovers Legislators Prelates Kings  All raptur'd listen as he raptur'd sings  Sweetness and Strength his Look and Lays employ  Greet Smiles with Smiles and ev'ry Joy with Joy  Charmful he rose his evercharmful Tongue  Joy to our second Hymeneals sung  Still as we pass'd the bright celestial Throng  Hail'd us in social  Love  and heav'nly Song  Of that no more my deathless Friendship see  I come an Angel to the  Muse  and  Thee  These Lights that vibrate and promiscuous shine  Are Emanations all of Forms Divine  And here the  Muse  tho' melted from thy Gaze  Stands among Spirits mingling Rays with Rays  If thou would'st Peace attain my Words attend  The last fond Words of thy departed Friend  True Joy's a Seraph that to Heav'n aspires  Unhurt it triumphs mid celestial Quires  But shou'd no Cares a mortal State molest  Life were a State of Ignorance at best  Know then if Ills oblige thee to retire  Those Ills Solemnity of Thought inspire  Did not the Soul abroad for Objects roam  Whence cou'd she learn to call Ideas home  Justly to know thy self peruse Mankind  To know thy God paint Nature on thy Mind  Without such Science of the worldly Scene  What is Retirement empty Pride or Spleen  But with it Wisdom There shall Cares refine  Render'd by  Contemplation  halfdivine  Trust not the frantick or mysterious Guide  Nor stoop a Captive to the Schoolman's Pride  On Nature's Wonders fix alone thy Zeal  They dim not Reason when they Truth reveal  So shall Religion in thy Heart endure  From all traditionary Falshood pure  So Life make Death familiar to thy Eye  So shalt thou live as thou may'st learn to die  And tho' thou view'st thy worst Oppressor thrive  From transient Woe immortal Bliss derive  FarewellNay stop the parting TearI go  But leave the  Muse  thy Comforter below  He said Instant his Pinions upward soar  He less'ning as they rise till seen no more  While  Contemplation  weigh'd the mystic View  The Lights all vanish'd and the Vision flew  FINIS  ERRATUM  Page Line for  th' etherial  read  the broad etherial  Lately Published
