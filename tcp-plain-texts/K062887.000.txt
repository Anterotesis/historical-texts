gorgeous Decorations of a Stage may I hope however merit an Hour's Perusal in the Closet when the fatigued Mind demands a Relaxation from Business there naked and unmasked it will disclose its

Sighs are vain  Yet still her SyrenBeauties smite    Assuage ye Gods my Pain  Throughout the Night I never clos'd my Eyes  But pass'd the restless Hours in venting Sighs  Nor does the Morn afford me any Ease  Throbbings and parching Fires my Members seize  Who is there that cou'd wish to be in Love  Like wretched me and yet how have I strove  To snap the cruel Fetters and regain  Primeval

The Wards of Reason in Confusion meet  This awful Visitwherefore was it paid  To tell me I shall wed this lovely Maid  "Tho' Sorrow for awhile disturbs thy Peace  "Submit to Patience and thy Pains shall cease"  This means that  Rodethusa  shall be mine  If for the future I no more repine  At  Cupid  's PersecutionsI'll obey  The strict InjunctionHeaven shall not say  I slight its high CommandsAnd yet 'tis hard  To suffer Torture and to be debarr'd  Heaving a Sigh or letting fall a Tear  "A Father's Voice shall strike thy wond'ring Ear"  It is a Sentence I cannot explain  This I'll forget'twill only rack my Brain  Suppose I tell my Mother what has pass'd  Disclose my PassionSecrets cannot last  She may unriddle what I can't make out  But then perhaps she'll blaze it at my Rout

Tho' not my Child he is my chiefest Joy  Alcim  Some few Days after Sirs as I pass'd by  That sacred Cave I heard an Infant's Cry  And ent'ring ina beauteous Infant found  And by its Side another little Hound  For this my Friend had told me Sirs before  Of his Adventure which made me the more  Astonish'd at this second Incident  Recov'ring from my deep Surprize I went  And took the Infant up and to my Cot  Convey'd it pleas'd with the sweet Load I'd got  As she in Years so she in Beauty grew  To Honour humble and to Virtue true  Tibist  What mean these strong Emotions that so shake  My troubled Soul  Sar  'Tis surely no Mistake  Those handsome Features all confess the Mother  And lo I see  Tibistheus  in the other  A Nymph of the Groves appears  Nymph  The Gods no longer will your Births conceal  Children advance and to your Parents kneel  Vanishes  They all appear astonished and a profound Silence continues for some Time  Sar  My Son  Tibist  My Daughter  Alex  and  Rod  Sire

But what shou'd the connubial Rites impede  Sarrastes  Sar  Thou hast my Consent  Tibist  Tho' stay  Here are some Debts which we have first to pay  Sarrastes  and  Tibistheus  commune with  Stimichus
