 HOMER  '  S  BATTLE OF THE  FROGS  and  MICE  Price  s    d    HOMER'  S  BATTLE OF THE  Frogs  and  Mice  WITH THE REMARKS of  ZOILUS  To which is Prefix'd The  LIFE  of the said ZOILUS  Vide quam iniqui sunt divinorum munerum Aestimatores etiam quidam  Professi  Sapientiam  Seneca  LONDON  Printed for BERNARD LINTOT between the  Temple  Gates MDCCXVII  PREFACE  _HAVING some Time ago heard that the Translation of  HOMER  'S  Iliad  wou'd be attempted I resolv'd to confer with the Gentleman who undertook it I found him of a tall Presence and thoughtful Countenance with his Hands folded his Eyes fix'd and his Beard untrimm'd This I took to be a good Omen because he thus resembled the  Constantinopolitan  Statue of  HOMER  which  Cedrenus  describes and surely nothing cou'd have been liker had he but arriv'd at the Character of Age and Blindness As my Business was to be my Introduction I told  him how much I was acquainted with the secret History of  HOMER  that no one better knows his own Horse than I do the Camel of  Bactria  in which his Soul resided at the Time of the  Trojan  Wars that my Acquaintance continued with him as he appear'd in the Person of the  Grecian  Poet that I knew him in his next Transmigration into a Peacock was pleas'd with his Return to Manhood under the Name of  Ennius  at  Rome  and more pleas'd to hear he wou'd soon revive under another Name with all his full Lustre in  England  This particular Knowledge added I which sprung from the Love I bear him has made me fond of a Conversation with you in Order to the Success of your Translation  The civil Manner in which he receiv'd my Proposal encouraging me to proceed I told him there were  Arts  of Success as well as  Merits  to obtain it and that he who now dealt in  Greek  should not only satisfy himself with being a good  Grecian  but also contrive to hasten into the Repute of it He might therefore write in the TitlePage  Translated from the Original GREEK  and select a  Motto  for his Purpose out of the same Language He might obtain a Copy of Verses written in it to prefix to the Work and not call the Titles of each Book The First and Second but Iliad  Alpha  and  Beta  He might retain some  Names  which the World is least acquainted with as his old Translator  Chapman  uses  Ephaistus  instead of  Vulcan    Baratrum  for  Hell  and  if the  Notes  were fill'd with  Greek  Verses it wou'd more increase the Wonder of many Readers Thus I went on when he told me smiling I had shewn him indeed a Set of Arts very different from Merit for which Reason he thought he ought not to depend upon them A Success says he founded on the Ignorance of others may bring a temporary Advantage but neither a conscious Satisfaction nor future Fame to the Author Men of Sense despise the Affectation which they easily see through and even they who were dazzled with it at first are no sooner inform'd of its being an Affectation but they imagine it also a Veil to cover Imperfection  The next Point I ventur'd to speak on was the Sort of Poetry he intended to use how some may fancy a Poet of the greatest Fire wou'd be imitated better in the Freedom of Blank Verse and the Description of War sounds more pompous out of Rhime But will the Translation said he be thus remov'd enough from Prose without greater Inconveniences What Transpositions is  Milton  forc'd to as an Equivalent for Want of Rhime in the Poetry of a Language which depends upon a natural Order of Words And even this wou'd not have done his Business had he not given the fullest Scope to his Genius by choosing a Subject upon which there could be no Hyperboles We see however he be deservedly successful that the  Ridicule  of his Manner succeeds better than the  Imitation  of it because Transpositions which are unnatural  to a Language are to be fairly derided if they ruin it by being frequently introduced and because Hyperboles which outrage every lesser Subject where they are seriously us'd are often beautiful in Ridicule Let the  French  whose Language is not copious translate in Prose but ours which exceeds it in Copiousness of Words may have a more frequent Likeness of Sounds to make the Unison or Rhime easier a Grace of Musick that attones for the Harshness our Consonants and Monysyllables occasion  After this I demanded what Air he would appear with whether antiquated like  Chapman  's Version or modern like  La Motte  's Contraction To which he answer'd by desiring me to observe what a Painter does who would always have his Pieces in Fashion He neither chooses to draw a Beauty in a  Ruff  or a  FrenchHead  but with its Neck uncover'd and in its natural Ornament of Hair curl'd up or spread becomingly So may a Writer choose a natural Manner of expressing himself which will always be in Fashion without affecting to borrow an odd Solemnity and unintelligible Pomp from the past Times or humouring the present by falling into its Affectations and those Phrases which are born to die with it  I ask'd him lastly whether he would be strictly litteral or expatiate with further Licenses I wou'd not be litteral replies he or ty'd up to Line for Line in such a Manner wherein it is impossible to express in one Language what has been deliver'd  in another Neither wou'd I so expatiate as to alter my Author's Sentiments or add others of my own These Errors are to be avoided on either Hand by adhering not only to the Word but the Spirit and Genius of an Author by considering what he means with what beautiful Manner he has express'd his Meaning in his own Tongue and how he would have express'd himself had it been in ours Thus we ought to seek for  HOMER  in a  Version  of  HOMER  Other Attempts are but Transformations of him such as  Ovid  tells us where the Name is retain'd and the Thing alter'd This will be really what you mention'd in the Compliment you began with a Transmigration of the Poet from one Country into another  Here ended the serious Part of our Conference All I remember further was that having ask'd him what he design'd with all those Editions and Comments I observ'd in his Room he made Answer That if any one who had a Mind to find Fault with his Performance wou'd but stay 'till it was entirely finish'd he shou'd have a very cheap Bargain of them  Since this Discourse I have often resolv'd to try what it was to translate in the Spirit of a Writer and at last chose the  Battle of the Frogs and Mice  which is ascrib'd to  HOMER  and bears a nearer Resemblance to his Iliad than the  Culex  does to the Aeneid of  Virgil Statius  and others  think it a Work of Youth written as a Prelude to his greater Poems  Chapman  thinks it the Work of his Age after he found Men ungrateful to shew he cou'd give Strength Lineage and Fame as he pleas'd and praise a Mouse as well as a Man Thus says he the Poet professedly flung up the World and apply'd himself at last to Hymns Now tho' this Reason of his may be nothing more than a Scheme form'd out of the Order in which  HOMER  's Works are printed yet does the Conjecture that this Poem was written after the Iliad appear probable because of its frequent Allusions to that Poem and particularly that there is not a  Frog  or a  Mouse  kill'd which has not its parallel Instance there in the Death of some Warrior or other  The Poem itself is of the Epick Kind the Time of its Action the Duration of two Days the Subject however in its Nature frivolous or ridiculous rais'd by having the most shining Words and Deeds of Gods and Heroes accommodated to it And while other Poems often compare the illustrious Exploits of great Men to those of Brutes this always heightens the Subject by Comparisons drawn from Things above it We have a great Character given it with Respect to the Fable in  Gaddius de Script non Eccles  It appears says he nearer Perfection than the  Iliad  or  Odysses  and excels both in Judgment Wit and exquisite Texture since it is a Poem perfect in its own Kind Nor does  Crusius  speak less to its Honour with Respect to the Moral when he cries out in an Apostrophe to  the Reader  Whoever you are mind not the Names of these little Animals but look into the Things they mean call them Men call them Kings or Counsellors or humane Polity itself you have here Doctrines of every Sort  And indeed when I hear the  Frog  talk concerning the  Mouse  's Family I learn Equality shou'd be observ'd in making Friendships when I hear the  Mouse  answer the  Frog  I remember that a Similitude of Manners shou'd be regarded in them when I see their Councils assembling I think of the Bustles of humane Prudence and when I see the Battle grow warm and glorious our Struggles for Honour and Empire appear before me  This Piece had many Imitations of it in Antiquity as the Fight of the Cats the Cranes the Starlings the Spiders c That of the Cats is in the  Bodleian  Library but I was not so lucky as to find it I have taken the Liberty to divide my Translation into Books tho' it be otherwise in the Original according as the Fable allow'd proper RestingPlaces by varying its Scene or Nature of Action This I did after the Example of  Aristarchus  and  Zenodotus  in the Iliad I then thought of carrying the Grammarians Example further and placing Arguments at the Head of each which I fram'd as follows in Imitation of the short Ancient  Greek Inscriptions  to the  Iliad  BOOK I  In  Alpha  the Ground  Of the Quarrel is found  BOOK II  In  Beta  we  The Council see  BOOK III  Dire  Gamma  relates  The Work of the Fates  But as I am averse from all Information which lessens our Surprize I only mention these for a Handle to quarrel with the Custom of long Arguments before a Poem It may be necessary in Books of Controversy or abstruse Learning to write an Epitome before each Part but it is not kind to forestal us in a Work of Fancy and make our Attention remiss by a previous Account of the End of it  The next Thing which employ'd my Thoughts was the Heroes Names It might perhaps take off somewhat from the Majesty of the Poem had I cast away such noble Sounds as  Physignathus    Lycopinax  and  Crambophagus  to substitute  Bluffcheek    Lickdish  and  CabbageEater  in their Places It is for this Reason I have retain'd them  untranslated However I place them in  English  before the Poem and sometimes give a short Character extracted out of their Names as in  Polyphonus    Pternophagus  c that the Reader may not want some Light of their Humour in the Original  But what gave me a greater Difficulty was to know how I shou'd follow the Poet when he inserted Pieces of Lines from his Iliad and struck out a Sprightliness by their new Application To supply this in my Translation I have added one or two of  HOMER  'S Particularities and us'd two or three Allusions to some of our  English  Poets who most resemble him to keep up some Image of this Spirit of the Original with an equivalent Beauty To use more might make my Performance seem a Cento rather than a Translation to those who know not the Necessity I lay under  I am not ignorant after all my Care how the World receives the best Compositions of this Nature A Man need only go to a Painter's and apply what he hears said of a Picture to a Translation to find how he shall be us'd upon his own or his Author's Account There one Spectator tells you a Piece is extreamly fine but he sets no Value on what is not like the Face it was drawn for while a second informs you such another is extreamly like but he cares not for a Piece of Deformity tho' its Likeness be never so exact  Yet notwithstanding all which happens to the best when I translate I have a Desire to be reckon'd amongst them and I shall obtain this if the World will be so goodnatur'd as to believe Writers that give their own Characters Upon which Presumption I answer to all Objections beforehand as follows  When I am litteral I regard my Author's Words when I am not I translate in his Spirit If I am low I choose the narrative Style if high the Subject requir'd it When I am enervate I give an Instance of ancient Simplicity when affected I show a Point of modern Delicacy As for Beauties there never can be one found in me which was not really intended and for any Faults they proceeded from too unbounded Fancy or too nice Judgment but by no means from any Defect in either of those Faculties  THE LIFE OF ZOILUS  THE LIFE OF ZOILUS  Pendentem volo Zoilum videre  Martial  _THEY who have discours'd concerning the Nature and Extent of Criticism take Notice That Editions of Authors the Interpretations of them and the Judgment which is pass'd upon each are the three Branches into which the Art divides itself But the last of these that directs in the Choice of Books and takes Care to  prepare us for reading them is by the learned  Bacon  call'd the  Chair  of the  Criticks  In this Chair to carry on the Figure have sate  Aristotle    Demetrius Phalereus    Dionysius Halicarnassensis    Cicero    Horace    Quintillian  and  Longinus  all great Names of Antiquity the  Censors  of those Ages which went before and the  Directors  of those that come after them with Respect to the natural and perspicuous Manners of Thought and Expression by which a correct and judicious  Genius  may be able to write for the Pleasure and Profit of Mankind  But whatever has been advanc'd by Men really great in themselves has been also attempted by others of Capacities either unequal to the Undertaking or which have been corrupted by their Passions and drawn away into partial Violences So that we have sometimes seen the Province of  Criticism  usurp'd by such who judge with an  obscure Diligence  and a certain  Dryness of Understanding  incapable of comprehending a figurative Stile or being mov'd by the Beauties of Imagination and at other Times by such whose natural  Moroseness in general  or  particular Designs  of Envy has render'd them indefatigable against the Reputation of others  In this last Manner is ZOILUS represented to us by Antiquity and with a Character so abandon'd that his Name has been since made Use of to brand all succeeding Criticks of his Complexion He has a Load of Infamy thrown upon him great in Proportion to the Fame of HOMER against whom he oppos'd himself If the  one was esteem'd as the very Residence of Wit the other is describ'd as a Profligate who wou'd destroy the Temple of  Apollo  and the  Muses  in Order to have his Memory preserv'd by the envious Action I imagine it may be no ungrateful Undertaking to write some Account of this celebrated Person from whom so many derive their Character and I think the Life of a  Critick  is not unseasonably put before the Works of his  Poet  especially when his Censures accompany him If what he advances be just he stands here as a Censor if otherwise he appears as an Addition to the Poet's Fame and is placed before him with the Justice of Antiquity in its Sacrifices when because such a Beast had offended such a Deity he was brought annually to l is Altar to be slain upon it  ZOILUS was born at  Amphipolis  a City of  Thrace  during the Time in which the  Macedonian  Empire flourish'd Who his Parents were is not certainly known but if the Appellation of  Thracian Slave  which the World apply'd to him be not meerly an Expression of Contempt it proves him of mean Extraction He was a Disciple of one  Polycrates  a Sophist who had distinguish'd himself by writing against the great Names of the Ages before him and who when he is mention'd as his Master is said to be particularly famous for a bitter Accusation or Invective against the Memory of  Socrates  In this Manner is ZOILUS set out to Posterity like a Plant naturally  baneful and having its Poison render'd more acute and subtile by a Preparation  In his Person he was tall and meagre his Complexion was pale and all the Motions of his Face were sharp He is represented by  Aelian  with a Beard nourish'd to a prodigious Length and his Head kept close shav'd to give him a Magisterial Appearance His Coat hung over his Knees in a slovenly Fashion his Manners were form'd upon an Aversion to the Customs of the World He was fond of speaking ill diligent to sow Dissention and from the constant Bent of his Thought had obtain'd that Sort of Readiness for Slander or Reproach which is esteem'd Wit by the light Opinion of some who take the Remarks of ill Nature for an Understanding of Mankind and the abrupt Lashes of Rudeness for the Spirit of Expression This at last grew to such a Heighth in him that he became careless of concealing it he threw off all Reserves and Managements in Respect of others and the Passion so far took the Turn of a Frenzy that being one Day ask'd why he spoke ill of every one  It is says he because I am not able to do them Ill tho' I have so great a Mind to it  Such extravagant Declarations of his general Enmity made Men deal with him as with the Creature he affected to be they no more spoke of him as belonging to the Species he hated and from henceforth his learned Speeches or fine Remarks cou'd obtain no other Title for him but that of  The Rhetorical Dog  While he was in  Macedon  he employ'd his Time in writing and reciting what he had written in the Schools of Sophists His Oratory says  Dionisius Halicarnassensis  was always of the demonstrative Kind which concerns itself about Praise or Dispraise His Subjects were the most approv'd Authors whom he chose to abuse upon the Account of their Reputation and to whom without going round the Matter in  faint Praises  or  artificial Insinuations  he us'd to deny their own  Characteristicks  With this Gallantry of Opposition did he censure  Zenophon  for Affectation  Plato  for vulgar Notions and  Isocrates  for Incorrectness  Demosthenes  in his Opinion wanted Fire  Aristotle  Subtilty and  Aristophanes  Humour But as to have Reputation was with him a sufficient Cause of Enmity so to have that Reputation universal was what wrought his Frenzy to its wildest Degree for which Reason it was HOMER with whom he was most implacably angry And certainly if Envy choose its Object for the Power to give Torment it shou'd here if ever have the Glory of fully answering its Intentions for the Poet was so worship'd by the whole Age that his Critick had not the common Alleviation of the Opinion of one other Man to concur in his Condemnation  ZOILUS however went on with indefatigable Industry in a voluminous Work which he entitled  The  or  Censure of  HOMER 'Till having at last finish'd it he prepares to send it into the  World with a pompous Title at the Head invented for himself by Way of Excellency and thus inserted after the Manner of the Ancients  ZOILUS  the Scourge of  HOMER  writ this against that Lover of Fables  Thus did he value himself upon a Work which the World has not thought worth transmitting to us and but just left a Specimen in five or six Quotations which happen to be preserv'd by the Commentators of that Poet against whom he writ it If any One be fond to form a Judgment upon him from these Instances they are as follows  Il  He says HOMER is very ridiculous a Word he was noted to apply to him when he makes such a God as  Apollo  employ himself in killing Dogs and Mules  Il  HOMER is very ridiculous in describing  Diomedes  's Helmet and Armour as sparkling and in a Blaze of Fire about him for then why was he not burn'd by it  Il  When  Idaeus  quitted his fine Chariot which was entangl'd in the Fight and for which he might have been slain the Poet was a Fool for making him leave his Chariot he had better have run away in it  Il  When  Achilles  makes  Priam  lie out of his Tent left the  Greeks  shou'd hear of his being there the Poet had no Breeding to turn a King out in that Manner  Od  The Poet says  Ulysses  lost an equal Number out of each Ship The Critick says that's impossible  Od  He derides the Men who were turn'd into Swine and calls them HOMER'S poor little blubbering Pigs The first five of these Remarks are found in  Didymus  the last in  Longinus  Such as these are the cold Jests and trifling Quarrels which have been registred from a Composition that according to the Representation handed down to us was born in Envy liv'd a short Life in Contempt and lies for ever bury'd with Infamy  But as his Design was judg'd by himself wonderfully well accomplish'd  Macedon  began to be esteem'd a Stage too narrow for his Glory and  Aegypt  which had then taken Learning into its Patronage the proper Place where it ought to diffuse its Beams to the Surprize of all whom he wou'd perswade to reckon themselves hitherto in the Dark and under the Prejudices of a false Admiration However as he had prepar'd himself for the Journey he was suddenly diverted for a while by the Rumour of the  Olympick  Games which were at that Time to be celebrated Thither he steer'd his Course full of the Memory of  Herodotus  and others who had successfully recited in that large Assembly and pleas'd to imagine he shou'd alter all  Greece  in their Notions of Wit before he left it  Upon his Arrival he found the Field in its Preparation for Diversion The Chariots stood for the Race carv'd and gilded the Horses were led in costly Trappings some practis'd to wrestle  some to dart the Spear or whatever they design'd to engage at in a Kind of Flourish beforehand Others were looking on to amuse themselves and all gaily dress'd according to the Custom of those Places Through these did ZOILUS move forward baldheaded bearded to the Middle in a long sadcolour'd Vestment and inflexibly stretching forth his Hands fill'd with Volumns roll'd up to a vast Thickness a Figure most venerably slovenly able to demand Attention upon Account of its Oddness And indeed he had no sooner fix'd himself upon an Eminence but a Crowd flock'd about him to know what he intended Then the Critick casting his Eyes on the Ring open'd his Volume slowly as considering with what Part he might most properly entertain his Audience It happen'd that the Games at  Patroclus  's Obsequies came first into his Thought whether it was that he judg'd it suitable to the Place or knew that he had fall'n as well upon the Games themselves as upon HOMER for celebrating them and cou'd not resist his natural Disposition to give Mankind Offence Every One was now intently fasten'd upon him while he undertook to prove that those Games signify'd nothing to the Taking of  Troy  and therefore only furnish'd an impertinent Episode that the Fall of the Lesser  Ajax  in Cowdung the Squabble of the ChariotRace and other Accidents which attend such Sports are mean or trifling and a World of other Remarks for  which he still affirm'd HOMER to be a Fool and which they that heard him took for study'd Invectives against those Exercises they were then employ'd in Men who frequent Sports as they are of a chearful Disposition so are they Lovers of Poetry This together with the Opinion they were affronted wrought them up to Impatience and further Licenses There was particularly a young  Athenian  Gentleman who was to run three Chariots in those Games who being an Admirer of HOMER cou'd no longer contain himself but cry'd out  What in the Name of  Castor  have we here ZOILUS from  Thrace  and as he said it struck him with a ChariotWhip Immediately then a Hundred Whips were seen curling round his Head so that his Face naturally deform'd and heighten'd by Pain to its utmost  Caricatura  appear'd in the Midst of them as we may fancy the Visage of Envy if at any Time her Snakes rise in Rebellion to lash their Mistress Nor was this all the Punishment they decreed him when once they imagin'd he was ZOILUS The  Scyronian  Rocks were near 'em and thither they hurried him with a general Cry to that speedy Justice which is practis'd at Places of Diversion  It is here that according to  Suidas  the Critick expir'd But we following the more numerous Testimonies of other Authors conclude he escap'd either by the Lowness of those Rocks whence he was thrust or by Bushes which might break his Fall and soon after following  the Courses of his first Intention he set Sail for  Aegypt  Aegypt  was at this Time govern'd by  Ptolomy Philadelphus  a Prince passionately fond of Learning and learned Men particularly an Admirer of HOMER to Adoration He had built the finest Library in the World and made the choicest as well as most numerous Collection of Books No Encouragements were wanting from him to allure Men of the brightest Genius to his Court and no Time thought too much which he spent in their Company From hence it is that we hear of  Eratosthenes  and  Aristophanes  those universal Scholars and candid Judges of other Mens Performances  Callimachus  a Poet of the most easy courteous Delicacy famous for a Poem on the Cutting of  Berenice  's Hair and whom  Ovid  so much admired as to say  It was Reason enough for him to love a Woman if she wou'd but tell him he exceeded  Callimachus    Theocritus  the most famous in the Pastoral Way of Writing And among the young Men  Aristarchus  and  Apollonius Rhodius  the one of whom prov'd a most judicious Critick the other a Poet of no mean Character  These and many more fill'd the Court of that munificent Prince whose liberal Dispensations of Wealth and Favour became Encouragements to every One to exert their Parts to the utmost like Streams which flow through different Sorts of Soils and improve each in that for which it was adapted by Nature  Such was the Court when ZOILUS arriv'd but before he enter'd  Alexandria  he spent a Night in the Temple of  Isis  to enquire of the Success of his Undertaking not that he doubted the Worth of his Works but his late Misfortune had instructed him that others might be ignorant of it Having therefore perform'd the accustom'd Sacrifice and compos'd himself to rest upon the Hide he had a Vision which foretold of his future Fame  He found himself sitting under the Shade of a dark Yew which was cover'd with Hellebore and Hemlock and near the Mouth of a Cave where fate a Monster pale wasted surrounded with Snakes fost'ring a Cockatrice in her Bosom and cursing the Sun for making the Work of the Deities appear in its Beauty The Sight of this bred Fear in him when she suddenly turning her sunk Eyes put on a hideous Kind of a loving Grin in which he discover'd a Resemblance to some of his own Features Then turning up her Snakes and interlacing them in the Form of a Turbant to give him less Disgust she thus address'd herself  Go on my Son in whom I am renew'd and prosper in thy brave Undertakings on Mankind Assert their Wit to be Dulness prove their Sense to be Folly know Truth only when it is on thy own Side and acknowledge Learning at no other Time to be useful Spare not an Author of any Rank or Size let not thy Tongue or Pen know Pity make the living feel  thy Accusations make the Ghosts of the dead groan in their Tombs for their violated Fame But why do I spend Time in needless Advice which may be better us'd in Encouragement Let thy Eyes delight themselves with the future Recompence which I have reserv'd for thy Merit  Thus spoke the Monster and shriek'd the Name of ZOILUS The Shades who were to bear the same Name after him became obedient and the Mouth of the Cave was fill'd with strange supercilious Countenances which all crowded to make their Appearance These began to march before him with an Imitation of his Mien and Manners Some crown'd with wild Sorrel others having Leaves of dead Bays mingl'd amongst it while the Monster still describ'd them as he pass'd and touch'd each with a livid Track of malignant Light that shot from her Eye to point where she meant the Description  They says she in the Chaplets of wild Sorrel are my Writers of Prose who erect Scandal into Criticism They who wear the wither'd Bay with it are such who write Poems which are professedly to answer all Rules and be left for Patterns to Men of Genius These that follow shall attack others because they are excell'd by them The next Rank shall make an Author's being read a sufficient Ground of Opposition Here march my Grammarians skill'd to torture Words there my Sons of Sophistry ever ready to wrest a Meaning Observe how faint the foremost of the Procession appear and  how they are now lost in yonder Mists which roll about the Cave of Oblivion This shews it is not for themselves that they are to be known the World will consider them only as managing a Part of thy Endowments and so know them by thy Name while they live that their own shall be lost for ever But see how my Cave still swarms how every Age produces Men upon whom the Preservation of thy Memory devolves My Darling the Fates have decreed it Thou art ZOILUS and ZOILUS shall be eternal Come my Serpents applaud him with your Hisses that is all which now can be done in modern Times my Sons shall invent louder Instruments and artificial Imitations Noises which drown the Voice of Merit shall furnish a Consort to delight them  Here she arose to clasp him in her Arms a strange Noise was heard the Critick started at it and his Vision forsook him  It was with some Confusion that he lay musing a while upon what he had seen but reflecting that the Goddess had giv'n him no Answer concerning his Success in  Aegypt  he strengthen'd his Heart in his ancient SelfLove and Enmity to others and took all for an idle Dream born of the Fumes of Indigestion or produc'd by the dizzy Motion of his Voyage In this Opinion he told it at his Departure to the Priest who admiring the extraordinary Relation registred it in Hieroglyphicks at  Canopus  The Day when he came to  Alexandria  was one on which the King had appointed Games to  Apollo  and the  Muses  and Honours and Rewards for such Writers as shou'd appear in them This he took for a happy Omen at his Entrance and not to lose an Opportunity of shewing himself repair'd immediately to the publick Theatre where as if every Thing was to favour him the very first Accident gave his Spleen a Diversion which we find at large in the Proem of the seventh Book of  Vitruvius  It happen'd that when the Poets had recited six of the Judges decreed the Prizes with a full Approbation of all the Audience From this  Aristophanes  alone dissented and demanded the first Prize for a Person whose bashful and interrupted Manner of speaking made him appear the most disgustful For he says the Judge is alone a Poet and all the rest Reciters and they who are Judges shou'd not approve Thefts but Writings To maintain his Assertion those Volumns were produc'd from whence they had been stoll'n Upon which the King order'd them to be formally try'd for Theft and dismiss'd with Infamy but plac'd  Aristophanes  over his Library as One who had given a Proof of his Knowledge in Books This Passage ZOILUS often afterwards repeated with Pleasure for the Number of Disgraces which happen'd in it to the Pretenders in Poetry tho' his Envy made him still careful not to name  Aristophanes  but a Judge in general  However Criticism had only a short Triumph over Poetry when he made the next Turn his own by stepping forward into the Place of reciting Here he immediately rais'd the Curiosity and drew the Attention of both King and People But as it happen'd neither the one nor the other lasted for the first Sentence where he had registred his own  Name  satisfied their Curiosity and the next where he offer'd to prove to a Court so devoted to  Homer  that he was ridiculous in every thing went near to finish his Audience He was nevertheless heard quietly for some Time till the King seeing no End of his Abusing the Prince of Philological Learning as  Vitruvius  words it departed in Disdain The Judges follow'd deriding his Attempt as an Extravagance which cou'd not demand their Gravity and the People taking a License from the Precedent hooted him away with Obloquy and Indignation Thus  Zoilus  fail'd at his first Appearance and was forc'd to retire stung with a most impatient Sense of publick Contempt  Yet notwithstanding all this he did not omit his Attendance at Court on the Day following with a Petition that he might be put upon the Establishment of Learning and allow'd a Pension This the King read but return'd no Answer So great was the Scorn he conceiv'd against him But ZOILUS still undauntedly renew'd his Petitions 'till  Ptolomy  being weary of his Persecution gave him a flat Denial HOMER says  the Prince who has been dead these Thousand Years has maintain'd Thousands of People and ZOILUS who boasts he has more Wit than he ought not only to maintain himself but many others also  His Petitions being thrown carelesly about were fall'n into the Hands of Men of Wit whom according to his Custom he had provok'd and whom it is unsafe to provoke if you wou'd live unexpos'd I can compare them to nothing more properly than to the Bee a Creature wing'd and lively fond to rove through the choicest Flowers of Nature and blest at home among the Sweets of its own Composition Not illnatur'd yet quick to revenge an Injury not wearing its Sting out of the Sheath yet able to wound more sorely than its Appearance wou'd threaten Now these being made personal Enemies by his malicious Expressions the Court rung with Petitions of ZOILUS transvers'd new Petitions drawn up for him Catalogues of his Merits suppos'd to be collected by himself his Complaints of Man's Injustice set to a Harp out of Tune and a Hundred other Sports of Fancy with which their Epigrams play'd upon him These were the Ways of Writing which ZOILUS hated because they were not only read but retain'd easily by Reason of their Spirit Humour and Brevity and because they not only make the Man a Jest upon whom they are written but a further Jest if he attempt to answer them gravely  However he did what he cou'd in Revenge he endeavour'd to set those whom he envy'd at Variance among themselves and invented Lies to promote his Design He told  Eratosthenes  that  Callimachus  said his Extent of Learning consisted but in a superficial Knowledge of the Sciences and whisper'd  Callimachus  that  Eratosthenes  only allow'd him to have an artful habitual Knack of Versifying He would have made  Aristophanes  believe that  Theocritus  rally'd his Knowledge in Editions as a curious Kind of Triffling and  Theocritus  that  Aristophanes  derided the rustical Simplicity of his Shepherds Tho' of all his Stories that which he most valu'd himself for was his constant Report that every one whom he hated was a Friend to  Antiochus  King of  Syria  the Enemy of  Ptolomy  But Malice is unsuccessful when the Character of its Agent is known They grew more Friends to one another by imagining that even what had been said as well as what had not was all of ZOILUS'S Invention and as he grew more and more the common Jest their Derision of him became a Kind of Life and Cement to their Conversation  Contempt Poverty and other Misfortunes had now so assaulted him that even they who abhorr'd his Temper contributed something to his Support in common Humanity Yet still his Envy like a vitiated Stomach converted every Kindness to the Nourishment of his Disease and 'twas the whole Business of his Life to revile HOMER  and those by whom he himself subsisted In this Humour he had Days which were so given up to  impatient Illnature  that he cou'd neither write any Thing nor converse with any One These he sometimes employ'd in throwing Stones at Children which was once so unhappily return'd upon him that he was taken up for dead And this occasion'd the Report in some Authors of his being ston'd to Death in  Aegypt  Or sometimes he convey'd himself into the Library where he blotted the Name of HOMER wherever he could meet it and tore the best Editions of several Volumns for which the Librarians debarr'd him the Privilege of that Place These and other Mischiefs made him universally shunn'd nay to such an Extravagance was his Character of Envy carry'd that the more superstitious  Aegyptians  imagin'd they were fascinated by him if the Day were darker or themselves a little heavier than ordinary some wore Sprigs of Rue by Way of Prevention and others Rings made of the Hoof of a wild Ass for Amulets lest they shou'd suffer by his fixing an Eye upon them  It was now near the Time when that splendid Temple which  Ptolomy  built in Honour of HOMER was to be open'd with a solemn Magnificence For this the Men of Genius were employ'd in finding a proper Pageant At last they agreed by one Consent to have ZOILUS the utter Enemy of HOMER hang'd in Effigie  and the Day being come it was on this Manner they form'd the Procession Twelve beautiful Boys lightly habited in white with purple Wings representing the  Hours  went on the foremost After these came a Chariot exceeding high and stately where sate one representing  Apollo  with another at his Feet who in this Pomp sustain'd the Person of HOMER  Apollo  's Lawrel had little gilded Points like the Appearance of Rays between its Leaves HOMER'S was bound with a blue Fillet like that which is worn by the Priests of the Deity  Apollo  was distinguish'd by the golden Harp he bore HOMER by a Volumn richly beautify'd with Horns of inlaid Ivory and Tassels of Silver depending from them Behind these came three Chariots in which rode nine Damsels each of them with that Instrument which is proper to each of the Muses among whom  Calliope  to give her the Honour of the Day sate in the Middle of the second Chariot known by her richer Vestments After these march'd a solemn Train aptly habited like those Sciences which acknowledge their Rise or Improvement from this Poet Then the Men of Learning who attended the Court with Wreaths and Rods or Scepters of Lawrel as taking upon themselves the Representation of  Rhapsodists  to do Honour for the Time to HOMER In the Rear of all was slowly drawn along an odd Carriage rather than a Chariot  which had its Sides artfully turn'd and carv'd so as to bear a Resemblance to the Heads of snarling Mastiffs In this was born as led in Triumph a tall Image of Deformity whose Head was bald and wound about with Nettles for a Chaplet The Tongue lay lolling out to shew a Contempt of Mankind and was fork'd at the End to confess its Love to Detraction The Hands were manacled behind and the Fingers arm'd with long Nails to cut deep through the Margins of Authors Its Vesture was of the Paper of  Nilus  bearing inscrib'd upon its Breast in Capital Letters  ZOILUS the HOMEROMASTIX  and all the rest of it was scrawl'd with various Monsters of that River as Emblems of those Productions with which that Critick us'd to fill his Papers When they had reach'd the Temple where the King and his Court were already plac'd to behold them from its Galleries the Image of ZOILUS was hung upon a Gibbet there erected for it with such loud Acclamations as witness'd the Peoples Satisfaction This being finish'd the  Hours  knock'd at the Gates which flew open and discover'd the Statue of HOMER magnificently seated with the Pictures of those Cities which contended for his Birth rang'd in Order around him Then they who represented the Deities in the Procession laying aside their Ensigns of Divinity usher'd in the Men of Learning with a Sound of Voices and their  various Instruments to assist at a Sacrifice in Honour of  Apollo  and his Favourite HOMER  It may be easily believ'd that ZOILUS concluded his Affairs were at the utmost Point of Desperation in  Aegypt  wherefore fill'd with Pride Scorn Anger Vexation Envy and whatever cou'd torment him except the Knowledge of his Unworthiness he flung himself aboard the first Ship which left that Country As it happen'd the Vessel he sail'd in was bound for  Asia Minor  and this landing him at a Port the nearest to  Smyrna  he was a little pleas'd amidst his Misery to think of decrying HOMER in another Place where he was ador'd and which chiefly pretended to his Birth So incorrigible was his Disposition that no Experience taught him any Thing which might contribute to his Ease and Safety  And as his Experience wrought nothing on him so neither did the Accidents which the Opinion of those Times took for ominous Warnings For he is reported to have seen the Night he came to  Smyrna  a venerable Person such as HOMER is describ'd by Antiquity threatning him in a Dream and in the Morning he found a Part of his Works gnaw'd by  Mice  which says  Aelian  are of all Beasts the most prophetick insomuch that they know when to leave a House even before its Fall is suspected Envy which has no Relaxation still hurry'd him forward for it is certainly true  that a Man has not firmer Resolution from Reason to stand by a good Principle than Obstinacy from perverted Nature to adhere to a bad one  In the Morning as he walk'd the Street he observ'd in some Places Inscriptions concerning HOMER which inform'd him where he liv'd where he had taught School and several other Particularitieswhich the  Smyrneans  glory to have recorded of him all which awaken'd and irritated the Passions of ZOILUS But his Temper was quite overthrown by the venerable Appearance which he saw upon entring the  Homereum  which is a Building compos'd of a Library Porch and Temple erected to HOMER Here a Phrenzy seiz'd him which knew no Bounds he rav'd violently against the Poet and all his Admirers he trampled on his Works he spurn'd about his Commentators he tore down his Busts from the Niches threw the Medals that were cast of him out of the Windows and passing from one Place to another beat the aged Priests and broke down the Altar The Cries which were occasioned by this Means brought in many upon him who observ'd with Horror how the most sacred Honours of their City were prophan'd by the frantick Impiety of a Stranger and immediately dragg'd him to Punishment before their Magistrates who were then sitting He was no sooner there but known for ZOILUS by some  in Court a Name a long Time most hateful to  Smyrna  which as it valu'd itself upon the Birth of HOMER so bore more impatiently than other Places the Abuses offer'd him This made them eager to propitiate his Shade and claim to themselves a second Merit by the Death of ZOILUS wherefore they sentenc'd him to suffer by Fire as the due Reward of his Desecrations and order'd that their City shou'd be purify'd by a Lustration for having entertain'd so impious a Guest In Pursuance to this Sentence he was led away with his Compositions born before him by the publick Executioner Then was he fasten'd to the Stake prophesying all the while how many shou'd arise to revenge his Quarrel particularly that when  Greek  shou'd be no more a Language there shall be a  Nation  which will both  translate  HOMER into  Prose  and  contract  him in  Verse  At last his Compositions were lighted to set the Pile on Fire and he expir'd sighing for the Loss of them more than for the Pain he suffer'd And perhaps too because he might foresee in his prophetick Rapture that there shou'd arise a Poet in another Nation able to do HOMER Justice and make him known amongst his People to future Ages  Thus dy'd this noted Critick of whom we may observe from the Course of the History that as several Cities contended for the  Honour of the Birth of HOMER so several have contended for the Honour of the Death of ZOILUS With him likewise perish'd his great Work on the  Iliad  and the  Odysses  concerning which we observe also that as the known Worth of HOMER'S Poetry makes him survive himself with Glory so the bare Memory of ZOILUS'S Criticism makes him survive himself with Infamy These are deservedly the Consequences of that  ill Nature  which made him fond of Detraction that  Envy  which made him choose so excellent a Character for its Object and those  partial Methods  of  Injustice  with which he treated the Object he had chosen  Yet how many commence Criticks after him upon the same unhappy Principles How many labour to destroy the Monuments of the dead and summon up the Great from their Graves to answer for Trifles before them How many by Misrepresentations both hinder the World from favouring Men of Genius and discourage them in themselves like Boughs of a baneful and barren Nature that shoot across a FruitTree at once to screen the Sun from it and hinder it by their Droppings from producing any Thing of Value But if these who thus follow ZOILUS meet not the same Severities of Fate because they come short of his Indefatigableness or their Object is not so universally the Concern of Mankind they shall nevertheless  meet a Proportion of it in the inward Trouble they give themselves and the outward Contempt others fling upon them A Punishment which every one has hitherto felt who has really deserv'd to be call'd a ZOILUS and which will always be the natural Reward of such Mens Actions as long as ZOILUS is the proper Name of

rends its flaming Passage thro' the Skies  Then Earth's Inhabitants the Niblers shake  And  Frogs  the Dwellers in the Waters quake  Yet still the  Mice  advance their dread Design  And the last

ex illo Zoile nomen Habes  _I MUST do my Reader the Justice before I enter upon these NOTES of ZOILUS to inform him that I have not in any Author met this Work ascrib'd to him by its Title which has made me not mention it in the LIFE But thus much in general appears that he wrote several Things besides his Censure on the  Iliad  which as it gives Ground for this Opinion encourages me to offer an Account of the Treatise  Being acquainted with a grave Gentleman who searches after Editions purchases Manuscripts and collects Copies I apply'd to him for some Editions of this Poem which he readily oblig'd me with But added he taking down a Paper I doubt I shall discourage you from your Translation when I show this Work which is written upon the Original by ZOILUS the famous Adversary of HOMER ZOILUS said I with Surprize I thought his Works had long since perish'd They have so answer'd he all except this little Piece which has a PREFACE annex'd to it accounting for its Preservation It seems when he parted from  Macedon  he left this behind him where he lodg'd and where no one enter'd for a long Time in Detestation of the Odiousness of his Character 'till  Maevius  arriving there in his Travels and being desirous to lie in the same Room luckily found it and brought it away with him This the Author of the PREFACE imagins the Reason of  Horace  's wishing  Maevius  in the th  Epode  such a Shipwrack as HOMER describes as it were with an Eye to his having done something disadvantageous to that Poet From  Maevius  the Piece came into the Hand of  Carbilius Pictor  who when he wrote against  Virgil  call'd his Book with a respectful Imitation of ZOILUS the  Aeneidomastix  and from him into the Hands of others who are unknown because the World apply'd to them no other Name than that of ZOILUS in Order to sink their own in  Oblivion Thus it ever found some learned Philologist or Critick to keep it secret from the Rage of HOMER's Admirers yet not so secret but that it has still been communicated among the  Literati  I am of Opinion that our Great  Scaliger  borrow'd it to work him up when he writ so sharply against  Cardan  and perhaps  Le Clerc  too when he prov'd  Q Curtius  ignorant of every particular Branch of Learning  This formal Account made me give Attention to what the Book contain'd and I must acknowledge that whether it be his or the Work of some Grammarian it appears to be writ in his Spirit The open Profession of Enmity to great Genius's and the Fear of nothing so much as that he may not be able to find Faults enough are such Resemblances of his strongest Features that any one might take it for his own Production To give the World a Notion of this I have made a Collection of some REMARKS which most struck me during that short Time in which I was allow'd to peruse the Manuscript  THE REMARKS OF ZOILUS UPON  Homer'  s  Battle  OF THE  FROGS  and  MICE  VERSE I TO fill my rising Song  As  Protagoras  the Sophist found Fault with the Beginning of the  Iliad  for its speaking to the  Muse  rather with an abrupt Command than a solemn Invocation so I  says ZOILUS  do on the other Hand find Fault with him for using any Invocation at all before this Poem or any such Trifles as he is Author  of If he must ase one  Protagoras  is in the right if not I am This I hold for true Criticism notwithstanding the Opinion of  Aristotle  against us Nor let any one lay a Stress on  Aristotle  in this Point he alas knows nothing of Poetry but what he has read in  HOMER  his Rules are all extracted from him or founded in him In short  HOMER'S  Works are the Examples of  Aristotle's  Precepts and  Aristotle's  Precepts the Methods  HOMER  wrought by  From hence it is to be concluded as the Opinion of this Critick that whoever wou'd intirely destroy the Reputation of HOMER must renounce the Authority of  Aristotle  beforehand The Rules of Building may be of Service to us it we design to judge of an Edifice and discover what may be amiss in it for the Advantage of future Artificers but they are of no Use to those who only intend to overthrow it utterly  After the Word  Song  in the first Line the Original adds  What I have written in my Tablets  These Words which are dropp'd in the Translation as of no Consequence the Great ZOILUS has thought fit to expunge asserting for a Reason without backing it with farther Proof  That Tablets were not of so early Invention  Now it must be granted this Manner of  proving by Affirmation  is of an extraordinary Nature but however it has its End with a Set of Readers for whom it is adapted One Part of the World knows not with what Assurance another Part can express itself  They imagine a reasonable Creature will not have the Face to say any Thing which has not some Shadow of Reason to support it and run implicity into the Snare which is laid for good Nature by these daring Authors of definitive Sentences upon bare Assertion  VERSE  Whom Cats pursu'd  The  Greek  Word here expresly signifies a  Cat  ZOILUS whom  Perizonius  follows affirms  It was Weezils which the Mouse fled from  and then objects against its Probability But it is common with one Sort of Criticks to shew an Author means differently from what he really did and then to prove that the Meaning which  they  find out for him is good for nothing  VERSE  If worthy Friendship  In this Proposal begins the Moral of the whole Piece which is that hasty illfounded or unnatural Friendships and Leagues will naturally end in War and Discord But ZOILUS who is here mightily concern'd to take off from HOMER all the Honour of having design'd a Moral asserts on the other Hand  That the Poet's whole Intent was to make a Fable that a Fable he has made and one very idle and triffling that many Things are ascrib'd to  HOMER  which poor  HOMER  never dream'd of and he who finds them out rather shews his own Parts than discover his Author's Beauties  In this Opinion has he been follow'd by several of those Criticks who only dip into Authors when they have Occasion to write against  them And yet even these shall speak differently concerning the Design of Writers if the Question be of their own Performances for to their own Works they write  Prefaces  to display the Grandness of the Moral Regularity of the Scheme Number and Brightness of the Figures and a Thousand other Excellencies which if they did not tell no one wou'd ever imagine For others they write  Remarks  which tend to contract their Excellencies within the narrow Compass of their partial Apprehension It were well if they cou'd allow such to be as wise as themselves whom the World allows to be much wiser But their being naturally Friends to themselves and professedly Adversaries to some greater Genius easily accounts for these different Manners of Speaking I will not leave this Note without giving you an Instance of its Practice in the Great  Julius Scaliger  He has been free enough with HOMER in the  Remarks  he makes upon him but when he speaks of himself I desire my Reader wou'd take Notice of his Modesty I give his own Words  Lib    Poet Cap    In Deum Patrem Hymnum cum scriberemus tanquam rerum omnium conditorem ab orbis ipsius creatione ad nos nostra{que} us{que} duximusIn quo abduximus animum nostrum a corporis carcere ad liberos campos contemplationis quae me in illum transformaret Tum autem sanctissimi Spiritus ineffabilis vigor ille tanto ardore celebratus est ut cum lenissimis numeris esset inchoatus Hymnus repentino divini Ignis impetu conflagravit  VERSE  The circled Loaves  ZOILUS  here finds Fault with the Mention of Loaves Tripes Bacon and Cheese as Words below the Dignity of the  Epick  as much  says he  as it wou'd be to have opprobious Names given in it  By which Expression we easily see he hints at the First Book of the  Iliad  Now we must consider in Answer that it is a Mouse which is spoken of that Eating is the most appearing Characteristick of that Creature that these Foods are such as please it most and to have describ'd particular Pleasures for it in any other Way would have been as incongruous as to have describ'd a haughty loud Anger without those Names which it throws out in its Fierceness and which raise it to its Pitch of Phrenzy In the one Instance you still see a Mouse before you however the Poet raises it to a Man in the other you shall see a Man before you however the Poet raises him to a DemiGod But some call that  low  which others call  natural  Every Thing has two Handles and the Critick who sets himself to censure all he meets is under an Obligation still to lay hold on the worst of them  VERSE  But me nor Stalks  In this Place ZOILUS  laughs at the Ridiculousness of the Poet who  according to his Representation  makes a Prince refuse an Invitation in Heroicks because he did not like the Meat he was invited to  And that the Ridicule may appear in as strong a Light to others as to himself he puts as much of the Speech as concerns it into Burlesque Airs and  Expressions This is indeed a common Trick with  Remarkers  which they either practice by Precedent from their Master ZOILUS or are beholding for it to the same Turn of Temper We acknowledge it a fine Piece of Satyr when there is Folly in a Passage to lay it open in the Way by which it naturally requires to be expos'd Do this handsomely and the Author is deservedly a Jest If on the contrary you dress a Passage which was not originally foolish in the highest Humour of Ridicule you only frame something which the Author himself might laugh at without being more nearly concern'd than another Reader  VERSE  So pass'd  Europa This Simile makes ZOILUS who sets up for a profess'd Enemy of Fables to exclaim violently  We had  says he  a Frog and a Mouse hitherto and now we get a Bull and a Princess to illustrate their Actions When will there be an End of this FablingFolly and Poetry which I value my self for being unacquainted with O great  Polycrates  how happily hast thou observ'd in thy Accusation against  Socrates  That whatever he was before he deserv'd his Poison when he began to make Verses  Now if the Question be concerning HOMER'S good or bad Poetry this is an unqualifying Speech which affords his Friends just Grounds of Exception against the Critick Wherefore be it known to all present and future Censors who have or shall presume to glory in an Ignorance of Poetry and at the same Time take upon them to judge of Poets that they are in all  their Degrees for ever excluded the Post they would usurp In the first Place they who know neither the Use nor Practice of the Art in the second they who know it but by Halves who have Hearts insensible of the Beauties of Poetry and are however able to find Fault by Rules and thirdly they who when they are capable of perceiving Beauties and pointing out Defects are still so ignorant in the Nature of their Business as to imagine the Province of Criticism extends itself only on the Side of Dispraise and Reprehension How cou'd any one at this Rate be seen with his proper Ballance of Perfection and Error or what were the best Performances in this Indulgence of ill Nature but as Apartments hung with the Deformities of Humanity done by some great Hand which are the more to be abhorr'd because the Praise and Honour they receive results from the Degree of Uneasiness to which they put every Temper of common Goodness  VERSE  Ye Mice ye Mice  The Ancients believ'd that Heroes were turn'd into DemiGods at their Death and in general that departing Souls have something of a Sight into Futurity It is either this Notion or a Care which the Gods may take to abate the Pride of insulting Adversaries which a Poet goes upon when he makes his Leaders die foretelling the End of those by whom they are slain ZOILUS however is against this Passage He says  That every Character ought to be strictly kept that a General ought not to invade the Character of a Prophet nor a Prophet of a General  He  is positive  That nothing shou'd be done by any one without having been hinted at in some previous Account of him  And this he asserts without any Allowance made either for a Change of States or the Design of the Gods To confirm this Observation he strengthens it with a Quotation out of his larger Work on the  Iliads  where he has these Words upon the Death of  Hector How foolish is it in  HOMER  to make  Hector  who thro' the whole Course of the Iliad had made Use of  Helenus  to learn the Will of the Gods become a Prophet just at his Death Let every one be what he ought without falling into those Parts which others are to sustain in a Poem  This he has said not distinguishing rightly between our natural Dispositions and accidental Offices And this he has said again not minding that tho' it be taken from another Book it is still from the same Author However Vanity loves to gratify itself by the Repetition of what it esteems to be written with Spirit and even when we repeat it our selves provided another hears us Hence has he been follow'd by a Magisterial Set of Men who quote themselves and swell their new Performances with what they admire in their former Treatises This is a most extraordinary Knack of Arguing whereby a Man can never want a Proof if he be allow'd to become an Authority for his own Opinion  VERSE  And no kind Billow    How impertinent is this Case of Pity  says ZOILUS  to bemoan that the Prince was not toss'd towards Land It is enough  he lost his Life and there is an End of his Suffering where there is an End of his Feeling To carry the Matter farther is just the same foolish Management as  HOMER  has shewn in his  Iliads  which he spins out into forty Triffles beyond the Death of  Hector But the Critick must allow me to put the Readers in Mind that Death was not the last Distress the Ancients believ'd was to be met upon Earth The last was the remaining unbury'd which had this Misery annex'd that while the Body was without its FuneralRites in this World the Soul was suppos'd to be without Rest in the next which was the Case of the Mouse before us And accordingly the  Ajax  of  Sophocles  continues after the Death of its Heroe more than an Act upon the Contest concerning his Burial All this ZOILUS knew very well But ZOILUS is not the only one who disputes for Victory rather than Truth These foolish Criticks write even Things they themselves can answer to shew how much they can write against an Author They act unfairly that they may be sure to be sharp enough and triffle with the Reader in order to be voluminous It is needless to wish them the Return they deserve Their Disregard to Candour is no sooner discover'd but they are for ever banish'd from the Eyes of Men of Sense and condemn'd to wander from Stall to Stall for a temporary Refuge from that Oblivion which they can't escape  BOOK II VERSE  Our Eldest perish'd  ZOILUS has here taken  the Recapitulation of those Misfortunes which  happen'd to the Royal Family as an Impertinence that expatiates from the Subject  tho' indeed there seems nothing more proper to raise that Sort of Compassion which was to inflame his Audience to War But what appears extreamly pleasant is that at the same Time he condemns the Passage he shou'd make Use of it as an Opportunity to fall into  an ample Digression on the various Kinds of MouseTraps  and display that minute Learning which every Critick of his Sort is fond to shew himself Master of This they imagine is tracing of Knowledge thro' its hidden Veins and bringing Discoveries to Daylight which Time had cover'd over Indefatigable and useless Mortals who value themselves for Knowledge of no Consequence and think of gaining Applause by what the Reader is careful to pass over unread What did the Disquisition signify formerly whether  Ulysses  's Son or his Dog was the elder or how can the Account of a Vesture or a Player's Masque deserve that any shou'd write the Bulk of a Treatise or others read it when it is written A Vanity thus poorly supported which neither affords Pleasure nor Profit is the unsubstantial Amusement of a Dream to our selves and a provoking Occasion of our Derision to others  BOOK II VERSE  Quills aptly boundFac'd with the Plunder of a Cat they flay'd  This Passage is something difficult in the Original which gave ZOILUS the Opportunity of inventing an Expression which his Followers conceitedly use when any  Thing appears dark to them  This  say they  let  Phoebus  explain  as if what exceeds their Capacity must of Necessity demand Oracular Interpretations and an Interposal of the God of Wit and Learning The Basis of such Arrogance is the Opinion they have of that Knowledge they ascribe to themselves They take Criticism to be beyond every other Part of Learning because it gives Judgment upon Books written in every other Part They think in Consequence that every Critick must be a greater Genius than any Author whom he censures and therefore if they esteem themselves Criticks they set enthron'd Infancy at the Head of Literature Criticism indeed deserves a noble Elogy when it is enlarg'd by such a comprehensive Learning as  Aristoile  and  Cicero  were Masters of when it adorns its Precepts with the consummate Exactness of  Quintilian  or is exalted into the sublime Sentiments of  Longinus  But let not such Men tell us they participate in the Glory of these great Men and place themselves next to  Phoebus  who like ZOILUS entangle an Author in the Wrangles of Grammarians or try him with a positive Air and barren Imagination by the Set of Rules they have collected out of others  BOOK II VERSE  Ye Frogs the Mice  At this Speech of the Herald's which recites the Cause of the War ZOILUS is angry with the Author  for not finding out a Cause entirely just for  says he  it appears not from his own Fable that  Physignathus  invited the Prince with any malicious Intention to make him away  To this we answer st That it is  not necessary in relating Facts to make every War have a just Beginning dly This doubtful Cause agrees better with the Moral by shewing that illfounded Leagues have Accidents to destroy them even without the Intention of Parties dly There was all Appearance imaginable against the Frogs and if we may be allow'd to retort on our Adversary the Practice of his Posterity there is more Humanity in an Hostility proclaim'd upon the Appearance of Injustice done us than in their Custom of attacking the Works of others as soon as they come out purely because they are esteem'd to be good Their Performances which cou'd derive no Merit from their own Names are then sold upon the Merit of their Antagonist And if they are sensible of Fame or even of Envy they have the Mortification to remember how much by this Means they become indebted to those they injure  BOOK II VERSE  Where high the Banks  This Project is not put in Practice during the following Battle by Reason of the Fury of the Combatants Yet the Mention of it is not impertinent in this Place forasmuch as the probable Face of Success which it carries with it tended to animate the Frogs ZOILUS however cannot be so satisfied  It were better  says he  to cut it intirely out nor wou'd  HOMER  be the worse if half of him were serv'd in the same Manner so  continues he  they will find it whoever in any Country shall hereafter undertake so odd a Task as that of Translating him  Thus Envy finds Words to put in the Mouth of Ignorance and the Time will come when Ignorance shall repeat what Envy has pronounced so rashly  BOOK II VERSE  And tap'ring SeaReed  If we here take the Reed for that of our own Growth it is no Spear to match the long Sort of Needles with which the Mice had arm'd themselves but the Cane which is rather intended has its Splinters stiff and sharp to answer all the Uses of a Spear in Battle Nor is it here to be lightly past over since ZOILUS moves a Question upon it that the Poet cou'd not choose a more proper Weapon for the Frogs than that which they choose for themselves in a defensive War they maintain with the Serpents of  Nile They have this Stratagem  says  Aelian    to protect themselves they swim with Pieces of Cane across their Mouths of too great a Length for the Breadth of the Serpents Threats by which Means they are preserv'd from being swallow'd by them  This is a Quotation so much to the Point that I ought to have usher'd in my Author with more Pomp to dazzle the Reader ZOILUS and his Followers who seldom praise any Man are however careful to do it for their own Sakes if at any Time they get an Author of their Opinion Tho' indeed it must be allow'd they still have a Drawback in their Manner of Praise and rather choose to drop the Name of their Man or darkly hint him in a Periphrasis than to have it appear that they have directly assisted the perpetuating of any  one's Memory Thus if a  Dutch  Critick were to introduce for Example  Martial  he wou'd instead of naming him say  Ingeniosus ille Epigrammaticus Bilbilicus  Or if one of our own were to quote from among ourselves he wou'd tell us how it has been remark'd  in the Works of a learned Writer to whom the World is oblig'd for many excellent Productions  c All which Proceeding is like boasting of our great Friends when it is to do our selves an Honour or the Shift of dressing up one who might otherwise be disregarded to make him pass upon the World for a responsible Voucher to our own Assertions  BOOK II VERSE  But now where  Jove'  s  At this fine Episode in which the Gods are introduced ZOILUS has no Patience left him to remark but runs some Lines with a long String of such Expressions as  Triffler    Fabler    Lyar    foolish    impious  all which he lavishly heaps upon the Poet From this Knack of calling Names joyn'd with the several Arts of finding Fault it is to be suspected that our ZOILUS'S might make very able Libellers and dangerous Men to the Government if they did not rather turn themselves to be ridiculous Censors For which Reason I cannot but reckon the State oblig'd to Men of Wit and under a Kind of Debt in Gratitude when they take off so much Spleen Turbulency and Illnature as might otherwise spend it self to the Detriment of the Publick  BOOK II VERSE  If my Daughter's Mind  This Speech which  Jupiter  speaks to  Pallas  with a pleasant  Kind of Air ZOILUS takes gravely to Pieces and affirms  It is below  Jupiter'  s Wisdom and only agreeable with  HOMER'  S Folly that he shou'd borrow a Reason for her assisting the Mice from their Attendance in the Temple when they waited to prey upon those Things which were sacred to her  But the Air of the Speech rendering a grave Answer unnecessary I shall only offer ZOILUS an Observation in Return for his There are upon the Stone that is carv'd for the Apotheosis of HOMER Figures of Mice by his Footstool which according to  Cuperus  its Interpreters some have taken to signify this Poem and others those Criticks who tear or vilify the Works of great Men Now if such can be compar'd to Mice let the Words of ZOILUS be brought home to himself and his Followers for their Mortification  That no one ought to think of meriting in the State of Learning only by debasing the best Performances and as it were preying upon those Things which shou'd be sacred in it  BOOK II VERSE  In vain my Father  The Speech of  Pallas  is dislik'd by ZOILUS  because it makes the Goddess carry a Resentment against such inconsiderable Creatures  tho' he ought to esteem them otherwise when they represent the Persons and Actions of Men and teach us how the Gods disregard those in their Adversities who provoke them in Prosperity But if we consider  Pallas  as the Patroness of Learning we may by an allegorical Application of the Mice and Frogs find in this Speech two Sorts of Enemies to Learning they  who are maliciously mischievous as the Mice and they who are turbulent through Ostentation as the Frogs The first are Enemies to Excellency upon Principle the second accidentally by the Error of SelfLove which does not quarrel with the Excellence itself but only with those People who get more Praise than themselves by it Thus tho' they have not the same Perversness with the others they are however drawn into the same Practices while they ruin Reputations lest they shou'd not seem to be learn'd as some Women turn Prostitutes lest they shou'd not be thought handsome enough to have Admirers  BOOK III VERSE  The dreadful Trumpets  Upon the reading of this ZOILUS becomes full of Discoveries He recollects  that  HOMER  makes his  Greeks  come to Battle with Silence and his  Trojans  with Shouts  from whence he discovers  that he knew nothing of Trumpets  Again he sees  that the  Hornet  is made a Trumpeter to the Battle  and hence he discovers  that the Line must not be  HOMER'  S  Now had he drawn his Consequences fairly he cou'd only have found by the one that Trumpets were not in use at the taking of  Troy  and by the other that the Battle of  Frogs  and  Mice  was laid by the Poet for a later Scene of Action than that of the  Iliad  But the Boast of Discoveries accompanies the Affectation of Knowledge and the Affectation of Knowledge is taken up with a Design to gain a Command over the Opinions of others It is too heavy a Task for some Criticks to sway our Judgments by rational Inferences a pompous  Pretence must occasion Admiration the Eyes of Mankind must be obscur'd by a Glare of Pedantry that they may consent to be led blindfold and permit that an Opinion shou'd be dictated to them without demanding that they may be reason'd into it  BOOK III VERSE  Big  Seutlaeus  Tumbling  ZOILUS has happen'd to brush the Dust of some old Manuscript in which the Line that kills  Seutlaeus  is wanting And for this cause he fixes a general Conclusion  that there is no Dependance upon any thing which is handed down for  HOMER'  S so as to allow it Praise since the different Copies vary amongst themselves  But is it fair in ZOILUS or any of his Followers to oppose one Copy to a Thousand and are they impartial who wou'd pass this upon us for an honest Ballance of Evidence When there is such an Inequality on each Side is it not more than probable that the Number carry the Author's Sense in them and the single one its Transcribers Errors It is Folly or Madness of Passion to be thus given over to Partiality and Prejudices Men may flourish as much as they please concerning the Value of a new found Edition in order to byass the World to particular Parts of it but in a Matter easily decided by common Sense it will still continue of its own Opinion  BOOK III VERSE  With  Borbocaetes  fights  Through the Grammatical Part of ZOILUS'S Work he frequently rails at HOMER for his Dialects  These  says he in one place  the Poet made use of because he could not write pure  Greek and in another  they strangely contributed to his Fame by making several Cities who observ'd something of their own in his mix'd Language contend for his being one of their Natives  Now since I have here practis'd a License in Imitation of his by short'ning the Word  Borbocaetes  a whole Syllable it seems a good Opportunity to speak for him where I defend myself Remember then that any great Genius who introduces Poetry into a Language has a Power to polish it and of all the Manners of speaking then in use to settle that for Poetical which he judges most adapted to the Art Take Notice too that HOMER has not only done this for Necessity but for Ornament since he uses various Dialects to humour his Sense with Sounds which are expressive of it Thus much in Behalf of my Author to answer ZOILUS As for myself who deal with his Followers I must argue from Necessity that the Word was stubborn and wou'd not ply to the Quantities of an English Verse and therefore I alter'd it by the  Dialect  we call  Poetical  which makes my Line so much smoother that I am ready to cry with their Brother  Lipsius  when he turn'd an O into an I  Vel ego me amo vel me amavit  Phaebus  quando hoc correxi  To this let me add a Recrimination upon some of them As first such as choose Words written after the Manner of those who preceded the purest Age of a Language without the Necessity I have pleaded as  regundi  for  regendi    perduit  for  perdidit  which Restoration of obsolete Words deserves to be call'd a  Critical License  or  Dialect    dly  Those who pretending  to Verse without an Ear use the  Poetical Dialect  of  Abbreviation  so that the Lines shall run the rougher for it And  dly  Those who presume by their  Critical Licenses  to alter the Spellings of Words an Affectation which destroys the Etymology of a Language and being carry'd on by private Hands for Fancy or Fashion wou'd be a Thing we shou'd never have an End  BOOK III VERSE  Nor Pallas Jove    I cannot  says ZOILUS  reflect upon this Speech of  Mars  where a  Mouse  is oppos'd to the God of War the Goddess of Valour the Thunder of  Jupiter  and all the Gods at once but I rejoyce to think that  Pythagoras  saw  HOMER'  S Soul in Hell hanging on a Tree and surrounded with Serpents for what he said of the Gods  Thus he who hates Fables answers one with another and can rejoyce in them when they flatter his Envy He appears at the Head of his Squadron of Criticks in the full Spirit of one utterly devoted to a Party with whom Truth is a Lye or as bad as a Lye when it makes against him and false Quotations pass for Truth or as good as Truth when they are necessary to a Cause  BOOK III VERSE  And a wholeWar    Here  says ZOILUS  is an End of a very foolish Poem of which by this Time I have effectually convinc'd the World and silenc'd all such for the future who like  HOMER  write Fables to which others find Morals Characters whose Justness is question'd unnecessary Digressions and impious Episodes  But what Assurance can such as ZOILUS have that the World will ever be convinc'd against an establish'd  Reputation by such People whose Faults in writing are so very notorious who judge against Rules affirm without Reasons and censure without Manners who quote themselves for a Support of their Opinions found their Pride upon a Learning in Trifles and their Superiority upon the Claims they magisterially make who write of Beauties in a harsh Style judge of Excellency with a Lowness of Spirit and pursue their Desire to decry it with every Artifice of Envy There is no Disgrace in being censur'd where there is no Credit to be favour'd But on the contrary Envy gives a Testimony of some Perfection in another and one who is attack'd by many is like a Heroe whom his Enemies acknowledge for such when they point all the Spears of a Battle against him In short an Author who writes for every Age may even erect himself a Monument of those Stones which Envy throws at him While the Critick who writes against him can have no Fame because he has no Success or if he fancies he may succeed he shou'd remember that by the Nature of his Undertaking he wou'd but undermine his own Foundation for he is to sink of Course when the Book which he writes against and for which alone he is read is lost in Disrepute or Oblivion  FINIS  BOOKS Printed for  BERNARD LINTOT  between the  TempleGates  THE Rt Honourable the Ld  Lansdown  's Plays  Mr
