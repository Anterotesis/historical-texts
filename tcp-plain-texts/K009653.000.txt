 A CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY OF THE CrownInn With CHARACTERS of some of the late SERVANTS And the PROCEEDING of the TRUSTEES To the Coming of the New LANDLORD  Part II  LONDON  Printed for J MOOR and Sold by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster  Price  d  A CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY  c  _SO many things of consequence offer at this time that I find I shall swell my Design to a much greater length than I imagined Instead of Writing once a Week I shall never be able to retain so many memorable Particulars or get thro' my Promise without adjusting the Substance every Post  You would split your Sides at the late Set of Servants and their  Favourers  in this Town were you to see how they behave themselves in their present Circumstances  What a mixture they discover in their Countenances of the Sullen and the Impertinent or indeed of the Spaniel and the Lion They wou'd fain lay a timely claim to the good Graces and Favour of Mr  WRIGHT  but their Pretensions are awkardly made out and built on such senceless Foundations that 'tis queer enough to hear them explain 'em  Harry Aucumy  who is at leizure now to carry on all the Intrigues that lay upon his Hands has had a very great Levee of Condolants since his late Misfortune for say they  Harry  appeared a Man of Spirit and was always firm to his  Purpose Harry  was resolute and constant in the Measures he pursued and wou'd have pushed Things with another manner of Spirit than that unaccountable Fellow  Slyboots  shew'd  who had been asleep for three Years  and always kept his  Friends  as well as his  Enemies  in doubt what he designed  Harry  was the Life of the  Cause  the Joy of the Party and the Toast of the  CLUB  From  Harry  we expected something very great and surprizing he had a Spirit and Impudence really fitted for it Our hopes in him daily increased we saw him on  Robin  's Downfal which was owing to his dextrous Conduct placed in a Sphere whereby his excellent Talents wou'd have come to shine in their full Lustre nay he had manag'd it so admirably that he sent the Trickster  Robin  off the Stage  with the utmost Disgrace which for Reasons well known to us would have proved of Service to future Purposes  But I must not stay to finish the  Encomiuns  these Visitants of  Harry  's bestow'd on him without letting you know that they were such Friends of young  Shute  's as began to place the greatest Confidence in him from the several steps which they plainly saw he had taken in his Favour The rest were such as  Harry  had really let into the Secret and among whom there ran a mutual and entire Chain of Confidence in which they wou'd all rather have Hang'd together than to have broke their Faith with one another  Must it not therefore be the most sensible Mortification to Men elated with such Hopes and inspired by a  Genius  so very promising as  Harry  's to promote their Views to see him at two Steps fall headlong from such an Eminence of Power and Authority and lye the bleeding Sacrifice of a  RuinedParty  at the Feet of his Enemies despis'd threaten'd and level'd to their Resentments by the Act of the new  LANDLORD  who singled him out like a Deer for the Chace to be the common Sport of all the honest Servants and Tenants nay even to his Antagonist  Robin  What can shew a Man more despis'd than the Message  delivered him by the  TRUSTEES  for his Dismission  Mr  Aucumy  Your Proceedings having rendered your Conduct suspected we are Order'd by our new LANDLORD Mr WRIGHT to tell you that he has no farther Service for you with Directions likewise to take from you your Books of Accounts and Seal up the COUNTINGHOUSE  You may be sure his Friends bleed inwardly for him but they have indeed the most admirable way of outfacing Things that ever was known They had before this given out that he stood on no bad terms with Mr WRIGHT and chiefly that on the first Indisposition of the  Widdow  it was he who promoted the Delivery of  BOB  's  ConjuringVVand  into the Hands of the  Chamberlain  which He could not chuse but acknowledge as a piece of good Service But this is somewhat like  BOB  's  INVIOLABLE ATTACH  This they maintain'd with an Assurance peculiar to them till the time of  Harry  's disgrace when a fresh Astonishment appeared in them and for two or three Days there was a general run of  Guilty  confused Faces among  the Party  Harry  himself stood this shock with a great deal of outward Confidence before his Friends because he was unwilling to discourage them but alas we know that nothing but a clear and unspotted Conscience can really support a Man's Spirits under such sudden and capital Afflictions This required that they should give their Sentiments a new turn and now  Harry  was consoled by his Friends as a Man purely suffering for his Principles and one who deserved all the Confidence they had placed in him  One wou'd think this Indication should have taught them a little Modesty but they go on at the old rate They will not stand convinced that they have a less share of the Favour of Mr WRIGHT than others tho' it is with the utmost Impudence and Vanity they dare even make Pretences to it They are the most impatient People at the loss of Power imaginable and certainly make the worst use of it when they have it of any living for they are all Heat and Choler whence it is observable thro' their precipitate and Posthaste Fury that they have never been long before they finished their Course  They have the merriest Way of Interpreting Things that can be They pretend they are very impatient for the arrival of the New LANDLORD being uneasie at  the Management of the TRUSTEES who have gone a great way toward putting the Affairs of the  INN  in a better Posture and to draw a better Trade to the whole  Town  They cannot or rather will not believe that the Choice of the TRUSTEES has any thing of the true Meaning of Mr WRIGHT in it but that it was done upon their own Solicitations and Intelligence and that they doubt not  but they shall soon convince him when they come to talk with him  Wou'd it not anger one that these Fellows should have the Impudence to form these preposterous Suggestions for I will forgive the Folly of it Do they think he has forgot or ever will their turning two or three of his Servants out of the House in a rude Sort of Manner though they paid honestly for what they called for only because they gave their Master Notice of their Intrigues Was any thing more grosly Impudent than  Harry  's Conduct in this Matter Or his inspiring the CLUB to do all they could to hinder  Young Mr VVright  from coming among them They are mistaken if they think him a Person so shortsighted as to be deceived in distinguishing his  Friends  from his  Foes  And if those who have always appeared in his Interest and on all Occasions justified their Love to him are not to  be intitled to his Favour nay if his own Sence of this in chusing such for TRUSTEES is not sufficient to prove it I leave them to be corrected by their own Folly  Every Reed serves a drowning Man to catch at you wou'd smile did you but know the mighty Splutter they make that their Consort  Tom Scatterwit  has shook Hands with Mr WRIGHT Now you must know there is no more in it than this  Tom  was Agent for the Widow at  NICK FROG  's especially on the Composition  Tom  like the rest of his Fraternity was a very active furious Fellow and when Reason wou'd not do he used to cock his Hat and tread upon  NICK  's Toes  NICK  made damn'd sour Faces but was not able to cope with the young Bully  Nick  in his Time had been a very sturdy Fellow but he was then cursedly pinched with Corns and could hardly stir out of his ElbowChair 'Tis true he kicked and winced a little but  Tom  always turned him by main Strength and in the End work'd him into Temper to consent quietly to the Agreement  Tom  on the  Widow  's Death lay under dreadful Apprehensions he was conscious that a very good Understanding wou'd ensue between Mr WRIGHT and  NICK  and that if  NICK  should remember the Smart of his Toes it wou'd prove but a little queer for him  Tom  therefore came to  NICK  and shewed a geat deal of unusual Condescension Instead of the Bully Cock he now came Cap in Hand and entered into an Expostulation somewhat servile He desir'd  NICK  to forget old Grudges and to make the best of Matters to Mr WRIGHT  NICK  looked a little sour on him as remembering the cursed Gripes he had given him however like a Man of Honour he told him he forgave him and should be glad to hear of his Conversion Another thing likewise laid  Tom  's Friends under some Apprehensions for him he was dipped in  Harry  's Project of entering into a League with Old  Savage  and his Grandson tending to the Prejudice of Mr WRIGHT's Interest and had unluckily written for further Orders therein just at the Time of the Widow's Death which Pacquet falling of course into the Hands of the TRUSTEES they sealed it up and sent it to Mr WRIGHT  Poor  Tom  looked plaguy queer upon it at first but it seems he has had a long Conference with Mr WRIGHT on his arrival at  NICK FROG  's which his Friends interpret strangely to his Advantage not that they think  Tom  will prove very Stanch but that they love a Fellow of a predominant Spirit Most People laugh heartily at this and say that  Tom  who is an excellent  Fellow at  Congee  and  Grimace  took all Opportunities to wriggle himself into Mr WRIGHT's Acquaintance and screw'd in at the lower End of the Table to Dinner  Nick Spitfire  was to have played the same Game at 'Squire  SOUTH  's but the 'Squire being a Man of Spirit forbid  Nick  the House and resolved to receive no Message from the Widow by such Hands which put  Nick  upon the Splutter for losing so favourable an Opportunity of exerting himself  Bob Bungey  is selling his Equipage again sensibly afflicted at the Miscarriage of his Business to  Phil Baboon Bob  breeds excellent Bullocks and has got Money by it but was never looked on to be a Fellow of any tollerable Sence  Matt Spindleshanks  the TavernBoy is in a strange Quandary whether he shall return Home or stay at Old  Savage  's 'Tis noted for excellent Air in a Consumption and 'tis very probable that  Matt  who is a little infirm will chuse it for his Health's Sake Life is sweet and 'tis very probable that the late Damps that have happened in this Country may be apt to suffocate poor  Matt  so that his Physicians have advised him that the other Air is more safe for him  Peregriue Scamper  who makes such a mighty Noise of his CONDUCT is lately return'd from his last  Errand  He pleads a great deal of Merit and is angry he was not nam'd one of the TRUSTEES To say Truth the Man had had never much Harm in him but being always thought a little Troublesome at Home was usually sent out of the Way for Quietness Sake Most People would believe he had done some Service if he talk'd Jess of it and had shewn less Compliance to some Points which render him a little disagreeable  Jacob Rash  the New Agent is the less concerned at being shut out of the Management of all Affairs at the INN because it furnishes him with an Opportunity to indulge himself in a voluptuous Life He was a zealous Promoter of  Harry  's New Scheme and a great Closeter of the BUFFCOATS upon that Occasion  Jacob  has lost his former Reputation and has the Misfortune of being looked on as a Tool when perhaps too much Indolence and good Nature only has been his Fault  Old  Biass  the Malster has a greater Inclination than a Spirit to do Mischief Covetousness which is in others a Crime has in him proved a Virtue He wou'd have gone  greater lengths in Young  Shute  's Favour but for the excessive dread of losing his Pelf Besides he saw no reason why he should Embark on a Level with Fellows of desperate Fortunes  Biass  dropt them in several Important Points and cry'd  Safe's the Word  He was willing to come in for something among them but wou'd not run the Hazard of losing one of his Gs for ne'er a Cause in  Christendom  so that People say  Though he is no very honest Man yet he has proved an excellent BOWLER  I know no one lies more exposed than  Sim  the Scrivener  Sim  's Principles prevailed over his Gratitude to shew his good Inclinations to Young  Shute  'Tis whispered that he has already receiv'd his  Quietus  and no doubt but a Post or two more will confirm it  Will Bromingham  notwithstanding his great Pretences looks with a very formidable dull Air He wou'd fain be thought to merit his Place but I hear Mr WRIGHT is of another Opinion  BOB  and  Harry Aucumy  are as far from being Friends as ever  Bob  has lost his Reputation with both Parties but  Harry  stands fair with one side at least In short  Harry  appears most Guilty but  Bob  has the more despicable Phiz  Will Wildfire  would be a solitary Fellow too if he was capable of thinking but that is what he never did in his Life He is a great Comforter to  Harry  under his Affliction and talks mightily of his Interest in a certain Family he is allied to by Marriage that are like to come into Favour but a Bottle I believe is the more solid consolation of the two  Arthur Skipkennel  has packed up his Moveables and is ready for the Scamper  Con  is turned out of the  West  Farm by the TRUSTEES A Fellow that has done a damn'd deal of Mischief to the Country there More of this in my next  Tom Dimple  has recovered his former Reputation  Tom  you must know was pitched on to carry Instructions to  Jacob Rush  in relation to  stifling the Evidence  mentioned in my last  Tom  thought he had been sent to influence the CAUSE but by a cursed Artifice found that  Bob  and  Harry  had sealed his Packet up  Tom  was chose  Steward  at the next CLUB and has shewn himself a very honest Friend of Mr WRIGHT's  Honest  Charles Barrier  is made Clerk of the Brewhouse in  Harry  's Room which is highly Satisfactory to all honest Men here  and no doubt is an Instance of Mr WRIGHT's Esteem to  Nick Frog  and to take off the Odium of his Conduct in concert with  Charles  when the CLUB at the INN in the  VVidow's  Time fell foul on him in opprobious Words and had like to have sent  Charles  to the  Stocks  for the  Bargain  he made with  Nick  in relation to some  Copses  and  Inclosures  on  Esq  South  's Estate which were to be put into  NICK  's Occupation wherein  Charles  as they alledged suffer'd him to infringe on a TURNIP FIELD or two of the  VVidow  's  Never was Man so joyfully caressed and entertained as Mr WRIGHT was at  NICK  's House both he and all his  Tenants  were ready to devour him for Joy And indeed to say Truth  NICK  had a great deal of Reason for his Exaltation for he had been used but a little scurvily in the latter part of the  VVidow  's Days Many of the New Servants hated him in their Hearts and 'twas feared that to bring about some other Design they wou'd not have stuck to persuade the  VVidow  into a Law Suit against poor  NICK  But these Fears are all cured now and  NICK  begins to speak and act with his usual Spirit again  I am yours  c  POSTSCRIPT  THE swift Current of Affairs at this Time will not let me I find conclude without a  Postscript  Jacob Rush  is dismist from the Agency and honest  John Trusty  has got his Place again  John  met Mr WRIGHT on the Road and wishing him Joy on his Accession to the Estate Mr WRIGHT answer'd  That he was satisfied a great deal was owing to him on that Occasion and he should always very gratefully remember his Services  This Day Mr WRIGHT arrived in Town Nothing can express the great Joy and Satisfaction of the People He was met  by the Heads of the Town and conducted to the  INN  thro' Crowds of Spectators making loud Acclamations  I just now learn that  Harry Aucumy  is sent for to be present at the opening of the COUNTINGHOUSE and that he comes with a heavy splenetick Air The same Hand informs me that poor  Sim  has receiv'd a very civil Message from Mr WRIGHT to desire his Absence from the House to make room for honest  WILL  the  COOPER  A Man that can  SEE  a little farther into a Milstone than the other  Sim  takes his misfortune very heavily and some queer Fellows that used to write Hackney under him are like to be reduced to the Circumstance of wanting Heels to their Shoes again These scurvy Dogs had just as much Love for Mr WRIGHT as their Master  I am likewise credibly informed that  Charles  the  HEADOSTLER Ned Topsail  and several other of the honest old Servants will have their Places again at the  INN  The House begins to flourish and none are to be admitted but what are known to be Men that have always promoted its Interest  I must now finish for every moment almost brings me some fresh Particular and I ne'er  should have done if I waited for any Conclusive Period  I wish this may come safe to your Hands for the  PostBoy  is such a damn'd impudent Rascal one is hardly  Abel  to express it The Dog sold Ballads up and down the Town before and now sets up for Writing News Letters He was a great Lurker about  Harry  's  Office  and 'tis thought has convey'd many a private Packet for him to Young  Shute  He has been often basted for his scurrilous sawcy Tongue without any Effect but 'tis very probable we shall now bring him to the  VVhippingPost  When  VVill Bromingham  troops off he will be forbid coming near the INN and we hope then to rid the Town of such a scurrilous Varlet  Even whilst I am Writing this short Postscript there is News of other numerous Changes at the INN but I cannot enter into Particulars till my next  Honest  Dan Sobersides  is popp'd into old  Biass  's TWOARM'DCHAIR at the CLUB  Jemmy Brisk  one of the prettiest Fellows in Town is made  Chief Clerk  in the room of  VVill Bromingham  You may perhaps not give this Article its full Weight but I can assure you 'tis meant  as a distant Compliment to 'Squire SOUTH  Jemmy  is one he has a particular Esteem for and his Preferment is an Argument that a good Understanding is renewed with the  'Squire  I believe you'll soon see Young  Shute  removed to a little farther Distance from the Estate If I don't conclude now I never shall
