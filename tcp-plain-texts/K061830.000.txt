 THE  PRINCESS of ZANFARA  A DRAMATIC POEM    ARATUS  AM I NOT A MAN AND A BROTHER  LONDON Printed for Mess WILKIE St Paul's ChurchYard  MDCCLXXXIX  TO THE SOCIETY INSTITUTED IN THE YEAR FOR THE PURPOSE OF EFFECTING AN ABOLITION OF THE  SLAVE TRADE  THIS SMALL TRIBUTE IS MOST RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED  BY The Editor  PERSONS of the DRAMA  MANZARA Prince of Cassaena  JEROME Governor of a Province in America  HORATIO  MARTINO  Planters  PEMBROKE A Trader  ANTONIO Supercargo in a Vessel trading with Slaves  CALABAN Commander of the Vessel  ZANGAE Freedman of JEROME  Counsellors of State  Slaves Sailors and Attendants  JAQUEENA Princess of Zanfara who in Captiviâˆ£ty takes the Name of LAURA  TERESA The Governor's Lady  AMELIA The Governor's Daughter  SCENE in AMERICA  THE  PRINCESS of ZANFARA  ACT I  The curtain drawing up discovers  LAURA  the female slave sitting by the side of a fountain in a Grove adjoining to the Governor's Palace  LAURA  YE warbling songsters of the vocal grove  Why waste you thus your soothing melody  Sweet bubbling fountains wherefore mix your voice  With the soft murmurs of the sighing breeze  Were ye not given to charm the ear of peace  The fair associate of liberty  These unpropitious regions claim you not  Haste to Zanfara and the happy shades  That crown her river's banks and crowd her shores  From whence you long too long have been estrang'd  With your Jaqueena whom alas such dark  And dire mischance involves that hitherto  Her weak and wandering hope no period sees  But in the arms of death  AMELIA  enters  I seek my maid  With anxious steps and still some solemn scene  Invites her melancholy stay and owns  Her tears shall not Amelia partake  Your woes and with her love alleviate  The griefs that rend dear Laura's tender heart  LAURA  If kind Amelia was not made so fair  If she was not of Christian principles  I might be led to trust her female heart  Possess'd compassion but the frozen hue  That nature plants upon her outward form  And what prescribes the maxims of her breast  Make me at once to tremble and distrust  And poor Jaqueena lives without a friend  AMELIA  My Laura's sweet benevolence of heart  And the intelligence that forms her mind  Should lift her far above such prejudice  Or fair or dusk the hue that climate gives  The blood that warms the veins with streams of life  In both the same with equal passion fires  The soul with equal ardour in the sacred cause  Of honour beats and forms the heart for love  LAURA  There is such soft delusion in your words  And what we wish we readiest believe  I almost am persuaded in my mind  Amelia holds a sister heart to mine  But your stern deity still looks unmov'd  On massacre and blood on slavery  And woe avenging notalas I sink  Under the horror of his devotees  AMELIA  The time will come my Laura when you'll know  The wretches who commit such dreadful crimes  Are not of the religion you accuse  LAURA  Were they not Christians that on Niger's flood  On board their dreadful bark receiv'd the lost  Jaqueena for the name of Laura bears  The badge of slavery and my reproach  Are they not Christians who in all this land  Make the poor Africans perform the task  Of beasts not barely to sustain the toil  But to endure the torture and with stripes  With nakedness and hunger to lie down  Stall'd worse than beasts to rankle in their sores  AMELIA  This is too much sweet Laura thus with tears  See me lament my country's hapless crimes  And the vile prejudice which clogs the wheel  Of partial justice  LAURA  Can a slave then hope  For your humanityfor tho' the blood  Is of one dye without congenial suns  It ripens not nor meliorates to love  Yet will I not forget your bounteous gifts  For Africans know not ingratitude  I am a slave not knowing bondage here  But in detention from my native land  For my kind mistress as Amelia kind  Nor gives me chains nor stripes nor wears a frown  There are some Christians of a milder soul  And such poor Laura happily protect  For if Amelia calls me by that name  Its terrors cease tho' it still comprehends  The tenor of my fortune  AMELIA  Whilst your mind  Seems thus imprest with favourable thoughts  And you confess Amelia's not severe  Trust to my ear the story of your life  And make me more your friend by sorrowing more  By mingling mutual griefs with Laura's tears  LAURA  A soothing melancholy still succeeds  The repetition of each solemn tale  Misfortune has to tellIn silence grief  Preys most upon the soul from sympathy  From soft compassion of our sorrowings  A sweet alleviation gently breathes  Not of inferior race my father rul'd  A province of the realm of Benin  Oft approbation shone upon his eye  Oft fond affection fill'd my mother's looks  Whilst on their smiling progeny they gaz'd  And call'd and kiss'd their daughter now your slave  AMELIA  Predicting in the fondness of their hopes  Propitious fortunes to their darling child  LAURA  Nor were their hopes mere shadows of the mind  For with affection's tenderest concern  My steps were follow'd and my looks pursu'd  They rul'd another's fatewith breasts of ice  As barren as the snows they emulate  You fair ones call such truths mere vanity  The great Manzaro kneel'd to win my heart  What wretchedness is mineI lov'd the Prince  Whom only death can to my love restore  On his tremendous wing he'll bear me hence  And to Zanfara waft this spirit safe  Superior to the frauds of cruel men  AMELIA  Some better Iot sweet Laura may betide  LAURA  Hope has departed hence and left my soul  To follow after when all earthly griefs  Are dissipated by the hand of death  It soothes the sorrows of my wretched mind  To grave the rock with piteous characters  Points to the rock  That move the fountain's neverceasing tears  To weep for ever o'er Manzara's name  Whilst gentle spirits in the sighing winds  On the sad sculptures mourn that memorize  My mother and my brothers  AMELIA  What of them  LAURA  Within the forest's skirts our tents were pitch'd  For more commodious hunting far advanc'd  The men were on the chase when we who held  The little camp were taken prisoners  A horrid tribe of robbers then in league  With Europeans trading to our states  Had stolen upon our unsuspicious guards  AMELIA  Of what complexion of what country born  Were those base violators of the land  LAURA  The cruel leaders were of British birth  The rest of Africa but long possess'd  By the fell demons of Europa's shores  They to recruit the heart for wickedness  Imbibe infernal furies in their drink  From deepest hell by chymic magic rais'd  That drive the brain to madness and impel  The hand to deeds of darkness  AMELIA  What ensued  LAURA  Our men were bound in fetters neck to neck  And hand to hand and we their woeful steps  Must needs pursuewhen frantic with her grief  My mother seiz'd a javelin for revenge  And by her angry arm one chieftain fell  But anger and resistance were in vain  She dy'd beneath a thousand dreadful wounds  Whilst to her bleeding bosom grasping close  In agonies of death her youngest son  A cruel lance transfix'd both breasts at once  And as the boy hung writhing on the shaft  The wretches made diversion of his pangs  AMELIA  O Britain where's thy boasted excellence  Thy fame that sounds on every peopled shore  Thy vaunted jurisprudence and thy love  Of liberty  LAURA  I then conceiv'd no thought  Of what might follow what should be our fate  But in immediate sorrows my sad mind  Was all absorb'dWe were receiv'd on board  A vessel crowded with a wretched race  Description finds no language to express  The horrors of the voyageThe hand of fate  Releas'd a multitudewithin these arms  My other brother dy'd and I'm forlorn  AMELIA  My soul is full of grief and yet a ray  Of hope divine like some prophetic light  By influence of guardian angel given  Takes hold upon my mind But we're observ'd  You must avoid the person that draws near  Retire and spare your grief the tale he brings  Would much increase your tears  Ex Laura  AMELIA  alone  I feel my heart  Renounce Antoniohis hateful trade  Imbitters every thought of intercourse  Habituated to subdue the force  Of his humanity what can remain  Within the breast of man that offers fruits  For nuptial happiness  ANTONIO  enters  To meet you thus  Is most propitious to my anxious hopes  My voyage perform'd with many healthy slaves  I now return to claim your faithful vows  And if the market proves of advanc'd price  My fortune's made and you alone command  My future life  AMELIA  I know not what it means  Some secret intimation moves my mind  That no felicity can e'er attend  Riches obtain'd by such inhuman ways  ANTONIO  Are these untoward sentiments conceiv'd  From Laura's guileful tears and whining tales  Can my Amelia estrange her mind  From reason and her proper judgment yield  To errors which prevail alone through fraud  AMELIA  There's more than fraud more than invention fills  The story of that hapless virgin's fate  ANTONIO  What inhumanity disturbs your thoughts  The navigator is not culpable  He takes the common traffic of the land  And by his toil brings riches to the state  The police of the nations there is such  Like other animals the herdsman sells  The Negro drove  AMELIA  I tremble at the thought  They that promote the sin partake the crime  ANTONIO  Inferior in creation tho' in form  Of human kindeach race of animals  Knows its gradationsand from perfect man  The Negro tribe is intermediate  It links the series that straight descend  Into the monkey line  AMELIA  If you would save  My mind from detestation treat not thus  A subject over which my labouring soul  Endures acutest pangs if you would win  My better sentiments this traffic leave  The generous association join  Who labour in humanity's great cause  With holy zeal to gain abolishment  Of your infernal merchandize  ANTONIO  My heart  Already your's your dictates must pursue  AMELIA  'Tis well Antonio and my confidence  Renews my Laura's sorrows fill my mind  I must procure the maid her liberty  ANTONIO  And when obtain'd what prospect will ensue  Where are the means of giving happiness  You'll only send her forth to meagre want  And in a foreign land a vagabond  Expose her to a thousand miseries  AMELIA  She must return to Africa again  Her country and her friends  ANTONIO  Romantic thought  The wand'ring tribe she left perhaps dispers'd  The government dissolv'd new tyrants reign  And warfare the rough habit of their lives  With chequer'd fortunes marks each petty Prince  Now reigning now in chainson Afric's coast  To greater perils greater woes expos'd  There's not a slave that in this province toils  But if return'd would worship the dire name  Of slavery that makes them tremble now  AMELIA  Your arguments enlarge the dreadful bounds  Of that vast sin which on your traffic rests  If restitution is impossible  The base captivity that thus cuts off  All human hope and no kind limit yields  To the sad injury but in the tomb  Of all the crimes on earth becomes the worst  My weary mind now finds no restingplace  ANTONIO  Even the servitude in which they sigh  Affords superior happiness and ease  To what their birthright gave  AMELIA  Desist desist  I'll hear no more'Tis in the human mind  The various estimates of happiness  Are rang'd whilst free and voluntary will  Directs the choiceIt is not luxury  With all its artificial wants and woes  That points out the criterion to mankind  It is not circumstance prescrib'd and bound  Within the limits of necessity  For that's a term mere fashion has assum'd  That points where Happiness shall stay her foot  'Tis habit that prepares the mind for ease  And knowing no restraint contentment gives  The various types that various nations hold  Whence to characterise the heavenly gift  Each calls felicityThe human soul  Finds liberty so innate through the world  The love of it prevailsSee Pembroke comes  Humanity's fast friend  ANTONIO  Hypocrisy's  Own son  PEMBROKE  enters  Disgrace pursues disgrace  America stands blighted in her fame  How are the annals of her glory stain'd  AMELIA  What new occasion wounds your gracious mind  PEMBROKE  Still here we hold the mart of human kind  New cargoes crowd our shores and on the beach  The squalid multitudes are pouring forth  From overloaded ships which like the curse  Of vile Pandora's box bring forth disease  With misery and pallid want  Crippled and maim'd whose ulcerating sores  Cling to the canker'd chains that rankle deep  And seek the bone  ANTONIO  Exists there not a law  Which should restrain such mischiefworking tongues  As hurt the merchant's credit and his wares  Thy phrase is false the slaves are healthy young  And vigorous  PEMBROKE  Then be it soThe world  With anxious eye regarded ev'ry step  That led the revolution to effect  And made us independentWond'ring states  Beheld our strengthOur public virtue shone  With a meridian lustre that amaz'd  The nations who submit to monarchy  And heaven stood influenc'd propitious stood  And look'd approving on the energy  That in the sacred cause of liberty  In ev'ry prayer we breath'd in every step  Maintain'd that brought fruition to our hopes  AMELIA  How has our country forfeited its fame  PEMBROKE  In Britain which we did calumniate  With charge of tyranny and power usurp'd  The flame humanity's most holy flame  Breaks forth illustrious all the people burn  With sense of liberty they boasted not  And the poor African the object grows  Of their wise councils and their sov'reign's care  Whilst we who mocked God with impious prayer  Mock'd the surrounding world with fallacy  Assum'd a character we could not prove  Now sever'dnow alien'dand left alone  Pull off the mask and vote an impious law  Restraining liberty for twenty years  AMELIA  Astonishing  ANTONIO  Firm sinews to bestow  To tradethe strength of nations  PEMBROKE  Public faith  Alone supports a people's strengthIn fraud  And treachery few momentary smiles  Of fortune fall but probity affords  Stability and honour to a state  What's the idea to the labouring wretch  That twenty toilsome years may terminate  His grievous taska space of sullen time  That much exceeds their ordinary stage  Of life  ANTONIO  The legislature wisely saw  Inevitable ruin must succeed  If instantly we should emancipate  And trust to hirelingsSuch excessive change  In dire confusion would involve the land  What mode of government could e'er restrain  The slaves discharg'd and set at liberty  That mighty work must by progression move  And into habit grow by slow degrees  Experience of clemency and laws  That mutual safety yield must tame  The savage's ferocious habit first  And fit him for subordinance  PEMBROKE  This day  The council sitsOn their opinion hangs  The fate of thousandsIf yet adverse Time  His wither'd hand extends against the steps  Of liberty a stigma he implants  Which all his smiles for ages won't erase  The issue I expect impatiently  Exit  ANTONIO  Are you deceiv'd Amelia by such phrase  Whilst honesty with open countenance  Is rash perhaps and speaks too much of truth  Despising subtletyFor that man's god  Is avariceHe'd suit the Japanese  And on the Christian's ensign trade and traffic  AMELIA  Your mind is heated and resentment prompts  The character you draw  ANTONIO  We soon may prove  His public virtue when his interest  Is fairly recogniz'dfor me I own  The trade has much of bitterness and woe  Command me in your Laura's interest  But first provide her some establishment  To bless and crown with liberty  End of the  FIRST ACT  ACT II  Scene a Plantation and Slaves at Work  The stage being extended sun  ry persons are seen performing the various labours of slaves the back scene continuing the representation  CALABAN  and  HORATIO  CALABAN  THIS was a glorious voyageThe sturdy knaves  Are fit for any labour and we bring  Full fifteen hundred safely to the port  HORATIO  What province are they ofFor much depends  Upon the breed some of the upland slaves  That border on the desert are of mind  So dark and so indocile that they seem  Of one gradation only above brutes  Those of more eastern clime are indolent  As bears are sluggish and not mov'd by stripes  They'll neither serve the mill nor till the ground  CALABAN  Well master mine are of the fav'rite breed  Twice ten degrees remov'd from the baboon  Their form is human and they're almost men  Boney and strong of countenance acute  And as hyaenas savagethey're the slaves  For labour as the mind is fierce and quick  Their bodies in proportion active are  On mountains skirts and wilds of Zara bred  The topsmen drove the herd to Niger's banks  The mart of Africa  HORATIO  Five hundred males  I purchase at your price but in the lot  I'll not receive that brute that stands aloof  And looks as if he held high estimate  Of his own consequence a slave like him  Would soon create a mutiny and stir  My whole plantation into plots and vile  Conspiracies  CALABAN  The creature's only mad  Through separation from his concubines  So the fierce bull would bellow and rebound  When from the pasture driven that holds his kine  Keep him but low in food and hard at work  And all those fiery sparks his nature holds  Will in free perspiration dissipate  Enter  MARTINO  and  PEMBROKE  PEMBROKE  Dost thou Martino purchase any slaves  Here is the carcaseman  CALABAN  And thou the knave  That would destroy thy country by thy wiles  For if the council mov'd by such men's cries  Should pass the curs'd emancipation vote  The envious Britons who could not subdue  Will triumph in the ruin treachery  Can soon effect by wretches such as thee  PEMBROKE  to  MARTINO  Some caution should be held for much depends  Upon the cause now agitating  MARTINO  And not a little on the market too  CALABAN  You purchase not and therefore shall not prate  To hinder the fair trader in his sale  PEMBROKE  Russian retire and know thy province here  Send forth thy factor for to him belongs  This duty and for thee associate  With fellows of thy proper element  Or to the magistrates I'll make complaint  CALABAN  Thy phrase is mighty tho' thy figure's meek  ANTONIO  enters  MARTINO  The factor comes and after him a few  By way of sample of the fittest slaves  ANTONIO  Not so these only bring some stores on shore  The rest refreshing on the beach will wait  To morrow's noon when they will be expos'd  Several slaves enter staggering under excessive burthens weak and emaciated with their voyage after them one who refuses any labour As he enters and looks upon the scene where the slaves are at work he starts  MOOR  Ah horrid spectacle of misery  And foul disgraceAre these thy wretched sons  Long suffering AfricThese of thy race  Of mighty men whose hardy sinews draw  The sounding bow and launch the javelin  With mortal strengthWho destitute of fear  Contend with hungry lions for their prey  And grapple with the tiger in his rage  Are ye so tame  ANTONIO  Consider what's your lot  And merit clemency  MOOR  Canst thou persuade  The raging winds to soften to thy will  And whistle in thine earOr dost thou know  How to appease the deep Atlantic's voice  When tempests howl on Gambia's aestuary  If thou hast magic in thee to do these  Then thou may'st smooth the temper of my soul  CALABAN  Bravo my gallant blade spoke like thyself  MOOR  Was this the land where that celestialdrug  That cures a thousand evils of the mind  Was planted by the seraphs of the sun  And by fair daughters of the silent moon  Water'd with dew of heaven here I might find  The godlike gift of liberty perhaps  In its vicinity doth justice grow  Of these I'd mix a potion should disgorge  The monsters of the deep  ANTONIO  To merit such  You must be peaceable and to the state  Obedient  MOOR  Awayrevile me not  Compassionate my fortune not contemn  My impotencebehold these shameful chains  Are they not peaceable are not these hands  Submissiveand this neck obedient  This is not worthy thy more feeling heart  Yet to my strength what would these bonds avail  If an exertion could improve my lot  PEMBROKE  Thy moderation merits our esteem  If ought of justice thou hast here to claim  Our governor and council daily sit  Within the public hall dispensing there  Impartially  MOOR  I mark thee wond'rous well  And if the spirits of my ancestors  Have not forsaken me or lost their course  O'er the wide desert of the dreary main  Perhaps the deity which we adore  Will not forget me in a foreign land  For they retaining much of amity  Will whisper in his ear"The African's  "In chains"  CALABAN  He raves and with his fortune mad  He knows not what he says  MOOR  Too true alas  Mad with my injuries and scoff'd at too  As stubble to the lightning I could shake  These links to atoms that my vengeful eyes  Might see thy heart's blood spout but that my views  Are larger and this friend to human kind  Has breath'd into my soul a nobler hope  And made me dream of justice  CALABAN  And thy dream  Will like the vision of the rolling cloud  Dissolve and only mock thy sickly brain  Returnand at the lodge where thou art stall'd  Wait for tomorrow's market  PEMBROKE  If he craves  A hearing for redress of injury  I will protect the man and pledge his price  CALABAN  Dost thou encourage mutiny  PEMBROKE  No more  Than I do villains  ANTONIO  This poor slave behav'd  With much discretion in the tedious voyage  And seem'd above his fortune save when sighs  Would sometimes heave his breast or tears would fall  MOOR  Antonio was compassionateWere I  In Africa I would not blush to say  What my heart feels  CALABAN  Dost thou depart with me  Or in this newform'd friendship shelter seek  MOOR  I crave to stand before the governor  And claim the benefit of those good laws  That even comprehend a Negro's wrongs  CALABAN  There is no law that can discharge a slave  Here slaves are property  PEMBROKE  Can you inform  Whether by purchase he obtain'd this man  ANTONIO  Not being of my lot I'm ignorant  MOOR  Such the peculiar hardship of my fate  But if my property may be restor'd  Intelligence will follow  CALABAN  He appeals  And I reserve my evidence to check  His subtletiesHe's been some pagan priest  Or one in magic ministering to hell  And thence derives his sophistry and spells  Exit Cal  PEMBROKE  Before the council what of evidence  Canst thou produce  MOOR  The evidence of right  Which is the most acceptable to heaven  PEMBROKE  What witnesses  MOOR  E'en none  PEMBROKE  How then prevail  MOOR  By argument and influence of truth  ANTONIO  What are the objects that the slave pursues  MOOR  Many and various are my mind's desires  As my dire injuries are multiply'd  First I would move the council to restore  Those things which were about my person borne  When I was made a captive  ANTONIO  Now retain'd  By Calaban  MOOR  Important in my cause  ANTONIO  But you had arms  MOOR  Should they be deny'd  Yet brought before the council those true marks  Which still contain my evidence they'll bear  And not an African from Niger's source  To Gambia's gulph but knows their signatures  ANTONIO  If that be all you seek command my voice  MOOR  Oh that Antonio was an African  The measure's now resov'd pursue the way  Impatience raises tumults in my breast  As they pass through the scene the  MOOR  stands to gaze on the sculptures upon the rock  When first I trod this shore I thought my steps  Were planted in the regions of the fiends  Those evil genii that haunt the ways  Of Afric's wretched sons with sad mishap  Butahastonishment  ANTONIO  What is't you read  MOOR  Pierc'd on this rock are characters obscure  In divination cast an horoscope  In which I find myself involv'dWho cut  The mystic line and carv'd the prophecy  Remains untold  PEMBROKE  The hieroglyphics these  Pointing to the rock  ANTONIO  Decypher them  MOOR  'Tis more than I may do  The same angelic hand that here engrav'd  The sacred emblems hovers in the clouds  And leaves me not  kneels  "O thou mysterious light  "Essence divine incomprehensible  "Who out of darkness brings forth mighty deeds  "And didst of nothing form all Africa  "Still imperceptible but in thy works  "Let thy blest spirit lift thy servant up  "From this adversity"  rises  My soul's refresh'd  PEMBROKE  Thy zeal has touch'd my spirit  ANTONIO  Oh my God  What is't we do what right can we assume  To bring into vile bondage men like this  Who serve thee tho' in darkness  aside  PEMBROKE  Describe what moves thee thus  MOOR  I know the hand  That grav'd that character must be divine  The fountain nymph invoking to her tears  It gives a name a fav'rite female name  Dear to my memory so totally  Unknown beyond the vast Atlantic's bounds  Which fevers this your nether world from ours  That nothing but some holy angel's arm  Could reach the mighty distance one whose grasp  Embraces all the earth  ANTONIO  'Tis wonderful  MOOR  The rest is more obscure petitioning  For pity from the spirits of the air  Groans are expir'd for some catastrophe  In which a mother with her infants fell  My soul sustains such dreadful agony  Such secret sorrows wrestle at my heart  I cannot utter moreTo kneelto weep  To worshipto expireis all that's left  The wretched African  PEMBROKE  Thou wound'st our hearts  With sorrow  ANTONIO  Anguish not to be endur'd  Why was I privy to such impious deeds  aside  MOOR  I am unman'dI lose my pious hope  My holy confidence yet he is not alone  Not desolate forsaken that has friends  In heavenWhy do I linger then behind  Bereft of all that life could give Oh Africa  What is there left thus to suspend my soul  ANTONIO  Why do we not proceed  MOOR  Grief's tempest raves  Within my heart and sorrows are renew'd  My adverse fortune did not promise this  That in the land of bondage I should meet  With traces mournful traces of the source  Of ev'ry tear I shed and all my woes  But holdI'd read againA thought succeeds  That blazes with delightPerhaps the hand  Inscribing this was her'sOh mighty powers  And who but she could tell the dreadful tale  Divine my fortune and divulge her own  Do you not know who grav'd these characters  PEMBROKE  They are of much antiquity here plac'd  As evidence of compact and good faith  Between the natives who resign'd the soil  And British voyagers  MOOR  You greatly err  The hieroglyphic's clearly African  Now liberty has double charms in view  And if the guardian spirits leave me not  Perhaps this land which terrible appear'd  Dark and unhallow'd as captivity  May yield me joysmost precious joys of life  And prove the scene of earthly extacy  PEMBROKE  'Twere better to retire  MOOR  Despise me not  For these excessive contrasts of the mind  I fly despair to snatch the hand of hope  So ready is the human heart to seize  The image of its wishes and to quit  The terror of its woesforgive me friends  From the idea which I last conceiv'd  New prospects open to my fancy's eye  The gloom breaks off the vapour dissipates  PEMBROKE  Let us avoid the curiosity  Of yonder females who observe our stay  MOOR  There's bounty in their looks why should we fly  As they depart the stage  TERESA  and  AMELIA  enter  TERESA  With them Antonio  AMELIA  And Pembroke too  TERESA  Who is that stately Moor we see attends  AMELIA  I have not heard  TERESA  As then we are alone  Let me unbosom to Amelia  My anxious thoughts  AMELIA  What cares can now possess  My gracious mother's breast  TERESA  Draw near my child  Hast thou observ'd in Laura's conduct aught  Of levity and in unguarded hours  Doth she reveal a habitude of mind  Which shews a vicious tendency  AMELIA  With me  Perhaps reserv'd she may restrain her thoughts  And guard her conduct but in virtue's cause  Few can display more excellence of mind  In sentiments refin'd and maxims pure  And such a chastity her speech doth grace  As would become the fairest Spanish dame  TERESA  Then all is well with thee  AMELIA  The question's strange  TERESA  I must dissemble and appear to throw  My vague suspicions on her lover's side  aside  AMELIA  You muse dear mother  TERESA  Yet I'm unresolv'd  Whether 'twere better not to wound your mind  With mere suspicions whilst no facts are found  Or warn thee to beware  AMELIA  Of whatof whom  TERESA  Of Laura  AMELIA  Would you then depreciate her  Who holds my good opinionor accuse  Some other  TERESA  Does Antonio never come  On frivolous pretence and fondly prate  Or waste in dalliance his idle hours  To trifle with the slave  AMELIA  You make me smile  Leave me to manage with Antonio  I cannot yield my mind to jealousy  It would degrade my own fair consequence  And so far lessen selfopinion too  That I should blush to own itcredit me  The maiden's virtues to such shameful fraud  Are as superior as light to shade  Ingratitude to her is yet unknown  Exit  TERESA  She does not seem to apprehend my thoughts  It cannot be the governor should stoop  So low in vice as to debase my bed  With such intrigueBut still suspicion lurks  Within my mind and jealousy once known  Is hard to be eradicated thence  Still feeding like cameleons on air  Maintaining an existence vile  End of the  SECOND ACT  ACT III  Scene the Groves near the Governor's Palace  Enter  ANTONIO  with the  MOOR  MOOR  I Mark'd his countenance and tho' there seem'd  A want of openness simplicity  The character of truth stood in his looks  His words were few but pertinent and strong  And thence persuaded into confidence  I trusted one chief secret to his ear  ANTONIO  If nothing more was trusted all is well  MOOR  You entertain some doubts  ANTONIO  Hypocrisy  Can mask the guileful measures of the heart  With fairest guisewhen he assumes too much  He gives distrustno outward show's requir'd  By virtueTho' the homely dress denies  The power of riches avarice prevails  Lucre of gold and traffic is his God  MOOR  Ha  ANTONIO  Next of kin to griping avarice  Is fraud  MOOR  Am I betray'dHas he deceiv'd  ANTONIO  Be not alarm'd perhaps I doubt too much  MOOR  Attendare we perceiv'dcan no one hear  All's safeIn infancy my father plac'd  His firstborn son with a most holy seer  The highpriest of the Gods to educate  In all the sacred learning of the sage  Who having gift of prophecy would oft  Gaze on my face with tears and cast his signs  To try if some good star might still prevail  Against predestin'd evils which he saw  Wrote in the book of fate from study deep  And science most divine discovering  A favourable planet he divulg'd  His thoughts  ANTONIO  I'm all attention  MOOR  "Still the Gods  "Are willing to preserve thee from the woes  "That shall beset thy steps in time to come  "Nor distant far the years captivity  "Shall be thy wretched fateA charm I hold  "Will from the misery of that estate  "Have power to liberate thee if apply'd  "With wisdom"  ANTONIO  Strange anxiety pursues  Thy story  MOOR  Straight he bound my trembling limbs  Fast to the sacred altar and my eyes  With mystic fillet clos'd then on my thigh  Incision made and introduc'd the charm  Extorting vows that till occasion call'd  If there should rest conceal'd and if such ill  As was foretold might yet averted be  By pious works or aid of powers above  That to the grave the holy boon I'd bear  Where he had plac'd it  ANTONIO  A prescience  Astonishing  MOOR  The dire event was come  And now the time and due occasion call'd  For this important gift to make its way  To light and give me libertyI told  The secret to my friend to Pembroke told  What gift I held and tho' he would deny  What superstition seem'd he lent his hand  And with a lancet brought a jewel forth  That would have ransom'd all the slaves you hold  ANTONIO  'Tis well I know the secret of this trust  Perhaps he may prove faithful but if not  I am thy witness to confront his fraud  So great a trust for avarice to tempt  Will prove his virtue to its very source  MOOR  You see what inadvertency pursu'd  The strange eventfor had I known what charm  The holy priest bestow'd more privacy  Would have prevail'dbut full of pious faith  I thought I merely held some mystic gift  To influence the powers invisible  ANTONIO  To what intent was Pembroke then to hold  The gem  MOOR  To change it into ready gold  Or borrow on its value what might serve  For my redemption and supply the calls  Of other exigence  ANTONIO  The time draws near  When 'tis accustom'd that the council sits  MOOR  You'll be my friend  ANTONIO  Depend upon my word  MOOR  Whilst I look after Pembroke should you meet  Use the intelligence as may seem best  ANTONIO  I'll see you at the hall  Exit Moor  A second claim  Calls forth humanityThe subtle knave  Should he betray the injur'd Moor in this  The act would prove of
