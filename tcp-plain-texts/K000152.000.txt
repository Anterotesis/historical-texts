 PROLOGUE TO THE COURT On the QUEEN's BirthDay  THE Happy Muse to this high Scene preferr'd  Hereafter shall in Loftier Strains be heard  And soaring to transcend her usual Theme  Shall Sing of Virtue and Heroick Fame  No longer shall she Toil upon the Stage  And fruitless War with Vice and Folly wage  No more in mean Disguise she shall appear  And Shapes she would reform be forc'd to wear  While Ignorance and Malice join to blame  And break the Mirror that reflects their Shame  Henceforth she shall pursue a Nobler Task  Shew her bright Virgin Face and scorn the Satyr's Mask  Happy her future Days which are design'd  Alone to Paint the Beauties of the Mind  By Just Originals to draw with Care  And Copy from the Court a Faultless Fair  Such Labours with Success her Hopes may crown  And shame to Manners an incorrigible Town  While this Design her eager Thought pursues  Such various Virtues all around she views  She knows not where to fix or which to chuse  Yet still ambitious of the daring Flight  ONE only awes her with Superior Light  From that Attempt the Conscious Muse retires  Nor to Inimitable Worth aspires  But secretly Applauds and silently Admires  Hence she reflects upon the genial Ray  That first enliven'd this Auspicious Day  On that Bright Star to whose Indulgent Pow'r  We owe the Blessings of the Present Hour  Concurring Omens of propitious Fate  Bore with One Sacred Birth an equal Date  Whence we derive whatever we possess  By Foreign Conquest or Domestick Peace  Then  Britain  then thy Dawn of Bliss begun  Then broke the Morn that lighted up this Sun  Then was it doom'd whose Councils should succeed  And by whose Arm the Christian World be freed  Then the fierce Foe was preordain'd to yield  And then the Battel won at BLENHEIM'S Glorious Field  FINIS  LONDON  Printed for  J Tonson
