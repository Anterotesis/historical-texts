 DEFINITION OF A CONSTITUTION  By THOMAS PAINE SECRETARY to the Congress of the United States of NORTH AMERICA c c c  "Nor hope to be myself less miserable  "By what I seek but others to make such  "As I though thereby worse to me redound"  MILTON'S PARADISE LOST  LONDON PRINTED FOR J DEBRETT OPPOSITE BURLINGTONHOUSE PICCADILLY MDCCXCI  DEFINITION c  A Constitution is a  Thing  antecedent to Government and a Government is only the Creature of a Constitution The Constitution of a Country is not the act of its Government but of  the People  constituting a Government It is the Body of Elements to which you can refer and quote article by article and which contains the principles upon which the Government shall be established the manner in which it shall be organized the powers it shall have the Mode of Elections the Duration of Parliaments or by what other name such Bodies may be called the powers which the ex∣ecutive  part of the Government shall have and in fine  every thing  that relates to the  compleat organization  of a  civil government  and the principles upon which it shall act and by which it shall be bound A Constitution therefore is to a Government what the laws made afterwards by that Government are to a Court of Judicature The Court of Ju∣dicature does not make the laws neither can it alter them it only acts in con∣formity to the laws made and the Govern∣ment is in like manner governed by the Constitution  Rights of Man by Thomas Paine c c c  WHAT a fortunate Age is this Mr Paine when every thing is defined every thing laid open to the meanest capacities every prejudice done away and Truth stands blushing before us stripped stark naked I had always had a strange veneration for the word  Constitution  though to say the truth till  I had the good fortune to stumble upon the above  short clear  and  precise  definition of it I was as little able to have explained its exact meaning as most of those who make use of it every day without asking themselves whether they annex to it any determinate signification  You have told us Sir what a Consti∣tution  is  and what it is  not  I am now instructed that it is  a thing  both in fact and name  "Aye but what thing Sir John what thing"  Why it is a thing that begets Government which begets Laws which beget Judica∣ture c and so they go on begetting one another to the end of the chapter And who begot the Constitution Why  the People  that is every individual of the Commu∣nity who having at some time or other been assembled together before the existence of Law and Government in a perfect state of independent nature did by themselves or by a select number amongst them chosen  for that purpose agree upon a  Body of Elements  to which you can refer and quote  article  by  article in a visible form  Parlia∣ments Elections c cThat all this is binding upon the Community for ever not to be altered in an  iota  till by what is called  a Revolution  the people think fit to put themselves as they have always a right to do back again into the original state by extinguishing all Law and Govern∣ment in order to amuse themselves with making a new Constitution  By this definition it is indeed clear that neither France nor England ever had a Con∣stitution nor any other country that I ever heard of Thus after mankind has been more or less in a state of Civil Government all over the world for so many thousand years it was reserved for the Philosophers of North America and the Jacobins  enlightened and enlightening  to convey to us the de∣finition through your organs of a word to which though it had been so long in every body's mouth the true sense had never  been affixeda word expressive of a  Thing  that never has had an existence  With due submission Sir to your in∣structive judgment suffer me to doubt at least whether the term in your sense of it can be with more propriety applied to the present state of France since the Revolution than it would under the Monarchy they have done away I will admit if you please what I believe you would hardly think of assuming as the fact that the elections of the Members to the Assembleés des Etats Generaux included the voice of every in∣dividual in the community  But pray did the People first place them∣selves in the original primitive state by de∣claring an abolition of all existing establish∣ments Did they delegate their authority to their Deputies in consequence of such a state of things with a formal commission expressly to frame a  new  Constitution as the basis of a  new  GovernmentSurely I must have grossly deceived myself if in many of their  instructions they did not expressly declare that they were  already  in possession of a Con∣stitution which they reclaimed from the time of Charlemagne a Constitution that was dear to them in the extreme and which they recommended to the protection of their at∣tornies in the strongest terms of anxious solicitude If this was the sentiment  ex∣pressed  in some of the cahiers of instruction was it not  implied in every one  of them who unanimously declare their attachment to the Monarchy with the other three orders of the state which they declare to be the lawful supreme Legislature of the kingdom and which they look up to as the redress of all their grievances and the Palladium of their liberties I shall suppose now that the Representatives are wiser than their Constituents that the  body  of  elements  they have devised is as much better as you please than those that were committed to their protection nay I will suppose even that the Nation "enlightened" since by the force of eloquence and of the lanthorn are at this moment of the same opinion with the As∣sembly  still as the Constitution that has been decreed under a commission not only containing no authority from the people for the destruction of all existing establishments and the constituting new ones but con∣taining the most positive commands to pro∣tect the existing establishments which were held sacred by them it is submitted to you in all humility whether such innovations come at all within the limits of your De∣finition whether those who accept a trust to one purpose and use it to the direct con∣trary can avail themselves of the authority they have betrayed whether if added to the breach of trust there happens to be at the same time a breach of the  Oath  their employers exacted from them to abide by their instructions instead of acting in direct opposition to them whether any oath im∣posed upon others afterwards by such an Assembly can be conceived even by them∣selves to have any validity whether in short upon your principle the powers as∣sumed by such a Body can be regarded as any thing more than a direct usurpation upon  the rights of the people and the force they exercise over all ranks of Citizens from the Monarch down to the Peasant with so free a hand can be considered as any thing but the  aristocratical  tyranny of an unauthorized though inviolable oppression and perjured Senate  The  concise clear  and  explicit  definition you have given us Sir of a Constitution has one great advantage attached to it which every  Lover of Liberty  will know how to appre∣ciate As it supposes an extinction of all law and government previous to the establish∣ment of the principles of a future system and as it is the duty of every good Citizen to endeavour to procure to his country the best possible situation he can devise it opens a wide field for  Patriot Exertions  It is hence∣forth not only an innocent occupation but a meritorious exercise of the rights of the individual whenever he has a new Consti∣tution to propose to begin by removing out of his way the existing establishments that he may convene his Fellow Citizens for the  purpose of considering the new body of ele∣ments he has to propound It will there∣fore be no longer a crime in future  Le∣gislators  such as Guy Vaux Jack Cade or Ld G G to destroy the present system much less to call upon the assistance of the people for that purpose and still less to suggest such arguments through the chan∣nel of the press or by word of mouth as may awaken them to the exercise of their indisputable indefeasible rights It is a duty they will fulfil in common with the most respectable authorities a Paine a Cromwell a Franklyn a Ravailac and a Mirabeau Whoever in future shall be arrested in his career by the charge of sedition will answer calmly  I am ignorant of the term to in∣cite my Fellow Citizens to the exercise of a lawful right for their own good can never be imputed as a crime  If ani∣mated in the cause of Freedom he should be transported beyond the bounds of per∣suasion into some overt act of violence as parricide for example he will say  I de∣serve a crown of laurel not a halter I  have a Constitution to propose by and by and am only preparing the necessary pre∣vious steps to it by bringing about a state of nature through a Revolution and the extinction of all Law and Govern∣mentI stand upon the  Rights of Man  and I defy you to touch a hair of my head  What a field does this open for the generous efforts of active patriotism un∣controuled  Luminous however Sir as your happy definition cannot but be esteemed the more we reflect upon it and pregnant with all the benefits to mankind which the philantropy of Modern Philosophy is so eager to impart one regret offers itself upon the perusal of it viz the utter impossibility of applying it to any practical purpose Like so many other excellent devices I fear it is only fitted to the speculation of the closet and the regions of metaphysical theory To obtain the  ac∣tual consent  for alas after all the  virtual  consent through delegates is little better than a mere fiction of law by which  millions of individuals equal free and inde∣pendent bind themselves to abide by a Go∣vernment to be formed upon the Consti∣tution they adopt to make a multitude and a multitude so compound capaple of comprehending discussing and determining the nice subtleties of the  Elements  of civil Polity without which apprehension and deliberation their consent is that of an Infant or an Idiot a mockery and mere form to frame these principles of Government and Legislation upon so broad a basis article by article as to embrace at once all the possible circumstances and situations to be bound by them hereafter any defect in which can have no other remedy but that of an appeal to the people in the state in which alone they are competent to form a new Constitution lastly to give efficacy system stability and permanence to a fabric built upon the change∣able base of the  pupularis aura  Such an idea however sublime of the only hold by which mankind are to be cemented  rightfully  in social relation to each other is in truth a Philosophy little framed for useful purposes  and worthy only of the elevated con∣templations of the Doctors of the Modern School  Less acute and less soaring Geniuses whose notions of Liberty consist in the secure and peaceable enjoyment of legal establishments transmitted to them by their ancestors with such amendments and renovations from time to time as the infallible test of  experience  may suggest the necessity of not in forming  new establishments  upon  new principles  who pre∣fer the being wisely governed to the govern∣ing others who can content themselves with the benefits arising from good Laws instead of indulging themselves in the fanciful  origin of Law  and definition of Constitutions will carefully keep those theoretical specu∣lations at a distance from the body politic as they will Books of Physic from the body natural whilst they feel no pressure of bodily infirmity No matter in either case whe∣ther the Constitution i e the organization of the constituent principle of sound health▪ be known or defined they will think it bad  when they suffer and will seek a remedy when they do not suffer they will if they are wise turn their ear from those who try to obtrude upon them their nostrums and me∣dical disquisitions which in one case will make them at least hypocondriac and fan∣tastic and in the other tends to render them dissatisfied turbulent and mischievous Citizens  FINIS
