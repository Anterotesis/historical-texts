 AEROSTATION OR THE TEMPLAR'S STRATAGEM  A  FARCE  IN TWO ACTS WRITTEN By F PILON Author of the  AIR AMERICAN DEAF LOVER LIVERPOOL PRIZE INVASION c  As it is performed with Applause at the THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  DUBLIN Printed by J EXSHAW for the COMPANY of BOOKSELLERS  MDCCLXXXV  DEDICATION  TO THE Right Hon LORD GRANTLEY CHIEF JUSTICE IN  EYRE  MY LORD  FULL of Anxiety for the future Welfare of my Country I beg Leave to call your Lordship's Attention for a Moment to the late  Aerostatic  Discoveries which at pre∣sent so much engage the Speculation of the World As Chief Justice in  Eyre  the Sub∣ject certainly comes more immediately under your Cognizance and if there be no Laws existing to limit within proper Bounds the Excursions of celestial Travellers I make no Doubt you will lay the Matter as early next Sessions as possible before Parliament in order to determine the Legislation of the upper Regions There is no Security now against the bold Aeronaut he may rob us of our Daughters and our Wives from our  highest Windows and set the fleetest Pur∣suers at Defiance who are only able to fol∣low him upon Terra firma I need not in∣form your Lordship that Poets are the only living Creatures the  Camelion  excepted that have any Interest or  Real Property in Air  It is well known that they have  built  in that Element and unpleasing Reflection have often been condemned to  feed  upon it A∣riosto obtained from Apollo the Fee Simple of all that vast Tract of Territory which lies between Italy and the Moon Milton fired with a Genius more than mortal shot up into the Heaven of Heavens and with Millions of flaming Cherubims at his Cha∣riot Wheels made all the Empyreal Firma∣ment his own whilst Shakespear on the Wings of Inspiration his head crown'd with Lightning and his Hand arm'd with Thun∣der subdued and peopled a vast  Aerial Con∣tinent  with Beings of his own wild and won∣derful Creation After the respectable Names I have just mentioned who possess so large a  Property in Air  I trust you will take the Matter into your most serious Con∣sideration but do not suppose my Lord that I am influenc'd by any selfish Motives in this Address I solemnly declare  all my Property  in  Nubibus  as yet consists of a few  temporary Booths  which I have  occasionally  ran up for the Accommodation of some  merry Acquaintances  who are  o  d of enjoy∣ing  a hearty Laugh at any ridiculous Shew the Crowd are admiring I feel my own Want of Importance too sensibly to expect any Application of mine for the  Security of Estates in Air  can deserve your Notice but I am confident that the Names of Milton and Shakespear will ever find a Patron in a Man of fine Taste and cultivated Under∣standing  I have the Honour to remain With the most profound Respect MY LORD Your most devoted and obedient Servant FREDERICK PILON  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr WILSON  TONIGHT's adventurer with awe looks round  And views the perils which his bark surround  Three years are past since on this coast he came  Bound on a dang'rous voyage in quest of fame  Your smiles he'll deem propitious beams that rise  Circling the star that lights his Polar skies  And near approaching that  magnetic  part  He feels the  needle  trembling at his heart  But of our bard enough perhaps I've said  When greater cares are lab'ring at my head  I make no doubt to entertain you soon  With a new theatre in a  stage balloon  No more in garret high shall poets  it  With rival spiders spinning cobweb wit  Like antient Barons future bards shall fare  In  their own castles  built up in  the air  Dull poets then  behind a cloud  shall stay  Whilst Fancy darting to the source of day  Bold as an eagle her career shall run  And with strong pinions fan the blazing sun  But ere we raise our playhouse in the skies  As Wit's Prime Minister I'll  raise supplies  For sad to tell above as here below  'Tis only  money makes the mare to go  Bubbles shall then be tax'd of ev'ry kind  Why tax the  light  and leave untax'd the  wind  First for  Pinetti's  sake of high renown  Who'll  steal the shirt off  any man in town  A heavy tax on Common Sense shall fall  Nay you may smile but it affects you all  Italian Op'ras like aliens I've devis'd  Shall pay a polltax to be  nat'raliz'd  Farce Dance  and  Pantomime  with  sprites  and  dragons  Shall pay the  carriagetax  of  broadwheel'd waggons  And as for  Tragedy  of modern date  Let it contribute at  Quack Med'cine rate  A tax too we enact  new pieces  pay  Apollo's  Civil List expences to defray  Living  or  dead  henceforward we decree  Damn'd  or  still born  no  author  shall be free  Genius  shall pay for being  born  to fame  And  Dullness  for the  burial  of its name  Thus of our  Ways  and  Means  the state you find  I hope these  aids  will meet the  House's  mind  On you the stage rests all her rising fate  You give our wit both  currency  and  weight  From hence like gold in circulation brought  By all the world it eagerly is sought  If critics come not on the  Mintage  night  To  clip  the  sterling  and then call it  light  Assist our wishes grant the meed we claim  Praise that inspires and smiles that guard our fame  Dramatis Personae  MEN  QUARTO  Mr QUICK  GEORGE GORDON  Mr DAVIES  MINEALL  Mr BONNER  SCRIP  Mr WILSON  DAWSON  Mr WEWITZER  MINEALL'S Servant  Mr NEWTON  WOMEN  The Widow GRAMPUS  Mrs WEBB  SOPHIA HARLAND  Miss RANO    KITTY  Mrs MORTON  MILLENER  Mrs POUSSIN  AEROSTATION  ACT I  SCENE IA STREET  Enter  KITTY  and  DAWSON  KITTY  COME Mr Dawson own the truthis'nt there another Lady in the question does not some new flame withdraw your master's affections from my young Lady  Daw  Some new flamepoor soulmy master and I are in love with a score of mistresses at a time For instance we admire one for her shape another for her air a third for her teeth a fourth for her eyes a fifth for her complexion a sixth for her wit a seventh  Kit  interrupting him  A seventh I am out of all patience does the blockhead know what he'd be at  Daw  I was going to say that I admir'd a seventh for possessing all the charms of the other sixand that her name is  Kitty  Is what  Daw  My lovely and even adorable Kitty Spright∣ly  Throws his arms round her waist  Kitty  Pats his cheek with her glove smiles and leans fondly on his shoulder  Plague take you for a flattering wretch there is no believing one word in twenty you saynow I suppose you think I take all this for gospel  Daw  I do upon my soul or I should not have said it to you the art of saying civil things Kitty is the true art of making ourselves and other people happy  I could speak thus to the woman of my heart for everwhen I had exhausted my fancy in praising her face her person should be my themeI'd find out new charms in her delicate hand her fineturn'd arm her beauteous neck and enchanting bosomfor it has long been with me an established maxim that it is impossible a man can say or do too many civil things for a pretty woman  Kitty  I wish civil sir you could prove that you possess'd as much secresy as you do civilityand I wou'd impart an affair which hereafter may prove of no small consequence to your civil worship  Daw  There's not a footman Kitty so remarkable for keeping a secret from Tower hill to Hydeparkcorner my talent in that way has obtain'd me the nickname of Guy Vaux and the Dark Lantern  Kitty  Being as much as to say this fellow's only fit for blowing up a plot tho' he loses his life by it however I'll run all risques and repose a confidence in you Can you guess what brought me here this morning  Daw  Guess the cause Kitty  Surveying his person with great selfcomplacency  I think the cause is pretty  striking  Causes of much less  attraction  have drawn women a great way  Kitty  No Mr Dawson I came hither to speak to you on another affair and I hope you will answer me like a friend an old fellow servant and a gentleman  Daw  Interrupting her and taking her in his arms  My dear Kitty you now speak to me in so moving a strain that I must take you in my arms  Kitty  My poor mistress is dying for love of your flintyhearted master  Daw  Lord child do you call that a secretI could have told you that  Kitty  Now I want to ask you in confidence and I beg you'll be serious Do you think that your master's present coolness to my young lady is owing to his af∣fections being engag'd in another place  Daw  Not in my opinion on the honor of a gen∣tleman  Kitty  But how can you be sure of that  Daw  I was witness to a little circumstance which puts the matter out of all question in my mind  Kitty  Tell it me tell it me dear Mr Dawson  Daw  Why as I was combing his hair yesterday morning I observ'd him take a miniature picture out of his waistcoat pocket and look at it as if he could eat it with his eyes judging it to be the likeness of some favourite Sultana I slyly popp'd my head over his left shoulder and whose do you think the picture was  Kitty  Nay how should I know  Daw  Miss Sophia's you jade  Kitty  You don't say so  Clapping her hands to∣gether with a mixture of surprise and joy  Daw  But that's not all Going out of the room I left the door on a jar from a habit I have of peeping and listening to every thing that passes in a family and then did I see him sit as good as an hour looking at and kissing the picture for all the world as if Miss Sophia herself had been there  Kitty  I wish from the bottom of my soul it had  Daw  But Mr Mineall coming up suddenly he put the picture in his pocket again in such a hurry as if he was afraid the very light of the sun should steal a kiss from it  Kitty  Deuce take that Mineall he's always spoiling sport But how could you be so illnatur'd as to banter me in the manner you did at first about your seven mis∣tresses and all such impossible stuff  Daw  Merely to keep my wit in play to give a finer edge to my satirical vein Wit my girl is like a sword if you wou'd make the world admire the beau∣ty of your blade you must throw away the scabbard friend or foe must receive the wound if you would shew its point but a master's hand is necessary to dis∣play the high polish of your weapon making it flash at every graceful turn with the lightning's quickness and the diamond's brilliancy  Kitty  Bless me how you do talk see what it is to be brought up from one's youth with a gentleman  of great learning I vow you have almost as much wit as your master  Daw  You're wrong Kitty you should have said that my master had almost as much wit as I for if my quantum of wit was not double my master's half my poverty would have been sufficient to hide it  Kitty  Well for the good news you have just told me there's a guinea for you  gives him a guinea  but it's all out of my own pocket mind I have no autho∣rity from my mistress  Daw  'Sdeath then I can't think of taking it  searching his pocket as if he could not find it  Kitty  Aside  Avaricious rogue I see he won't part with it so I'll teize him a bitWell if you are so generous I'll take my guinea back  Daw  But then I was thinking Kitty your mis∣tress will pay you again when you tell her the circum∣stance  Kitty  Not she indeed so come come give it me again  Daw  pulls out the guinea  Zounds how you hurry me you hav'n't giv'n me time to look whether it's a George the Third or an old Carolus  balanc∣ing the Guinea on the top of his finger  it's very light Kitty  Kitty  If you don't like it why don't you return it  Daw  What and suffer you to lose by it No no my dear I'll change it and stand to the loss and if your mistress refuses to pay this small disbursement ad∣vanc'd in her service on the honor of a gentleman you shall have a guinea of such unequivocal weight that it shan't want the sixteenth part of a scruple  Kitty  No Dawson I give it up if you have so many scruples about parting with a light guinea I'm sure you'll make no kind of scruple of withholding from me a heavy one  Exeunt severally  SCENE II  MINEALL  's Apartments in the  Temple QUARTO GEORGE GORDON  and  MINEALL  discovered sitting at a Table Wine and Glasses before them  Quar  I protest Mr Mineall you students of law are delightfully situated here in the inner Templewhat a charming shew of fine girls in the garden and of wharfs wherries and coal barges on the water Indeed I think you are too pleasantly situated to de∣vote much of your attention to study a roguish leer from a fine woman's eye under your window would soon make you abandon the perusal of the Statutes there is no resisting her when she chuses to enforce the Habeas Corpus Act  Mine  In my opinion Sir there cannot be too ma∣ny agreeable objects to relax the mind after intense study  Quar  You are wrong Mr MineallI'd treat a young Lawyer as I would a young starling you can't put him in too dark a cage to make him talk wellbut now I look round this apartment is it not con∣founded extravagant to keep all these windows open I have clos'd my garret windows entirely have left but one open on the first and second floor and if it wasn't for shame would be content with the light of a back parlour windowCome lads  filling his glass  I'll give you a fine woman one of the best editions of her sex Here's the widow Grampus  drinks  George  Then Uncle you are seriously determin'd to marry her  Quar  Seriously Georgesince your aunt's death I have pass'd the life of a hermitwhat are we born for but society I want some one to fill out my tea of a morning to press me to another slice at dinner and play a game of backgammon with me of an after∣noon These are the comforts of matrimony but you are too young to have a notion of them yet  Geo  And do you expect the widow will indulge you in all those matrimonial comforts  Mine  I know she hates backgammon because wo∣men of fashion never play at it  Quar  It's false Sir besides I'm sure she doats up∣on me she has told me a hundred times that I had wit at my fingers ends  Geo  But that compliment uncle Quarto has lost it's point now you have left off bookselling  Quar  You provoking puppy what do you suppose I see in the blank margin of your fool'scap counte∣nance to make me put up with such insolence Have you forgot sirrah that I have treated you as my own child since you were the height of a Pope's Homer have you forgot you dog that though you were brought up at Oxford and are now a fine gentleman that your grandfather was a Baker at Aberdeen and never saw the alphabet but upon his own gingerbread There's your brother Sandy too when he heard of your exploit he must needs have an itch for coming to England and be damn'd to him I shall never for∣get the figure he cut the first time I saw him with his broad accent his long Scotch face and such a red head that you might have lit a candle at his pole and if I hadn't a regard for him as my sister's son I'd have sent him trooping back to Scotland again I had like to have lost all my English customers by the vil∣lain for it's well known he was obliged to wear gloves the first three months he was in the shop  Geo  I am exceedingly sorry that a harmless sally of imagination should have given so much offence where I owe nothing but the highest respect and the warm∣est gratitude My objection Sir is not to your mar∣rying but to the object of your choice Dear uncle isn't she rather too old for you  Quar  Old George ha ha ha why to be sure George a man of my figure and constitution might have shot at younger game but there has been a  tendre  between us for these some years past when I was in business she us'd to call me the learned Aris∣tarchus of Paternosterrow and I called her the di∣vine Sappho of Watlingstreet  gets up and takes  his hat and cane  I am sorry friend Mineall I must leave you so soon but when a lady is in the case  Mine  And so accomplished as the Widow Gram∣pus every thing must yield to her  Quar  She expects a great philosopher to visit her this afternoon an Egyptian I understand by birth who has discovered a wonderful pickle in which whatever i  immerg'd contracts the properties of a salamander and will never afterwards consume in fire  Mine  And no doubt Sir your gallantry has in∣duc'd you to solicit the honor of being the first English salamander pickled for the experiment  Quar  No faith I have no ambition to be a pick∣led salamander though I should like to see the disco∣very brought to perfection for the honor of my Coun∣try France has just obtained the dominion of the air England for centuries has had the sov'reignty of the seas the only element we want the command of now is fire to make the records of English glory immortal  Exit  Quarto  Geo  What's to be done Frank if he should marry this woman she'll dissipate both his fortune and her own on the ridiculous schemes of needy projectors He hasn't settled a shilling on me yet  Mine  Your servant Dawson I think speaks French  Geo  Extraordinary well but what then  Mine  A thought has come into my head by which I think I shall be able to break off your Uncle's mar∣riage with Mrs  Grampus  there is a German Baron of the name of Bubble Bergen a great virtuoso at Vien∣na with whom her Brother Scrip constantly corre∣sponds being as Balloonmad as himself but never has seen him Suppose we make Dawson personate this philosophical Foreigner Scrip will receive him with open arms and as the dog has at least the recom∣mendation of youth upon his side I'll stake my exist∣ence if he lays siege properly to the widow he car∣ries the fort from your Uncle  Geo  I must acknowledge your plan is sensible every day's experience shews us to what lengths elder∣ly  ladies will go to indulge the heart in all its parti∣alities  Mine  But I'll not stop here to serve you George if I can bring my project completely to bear I shall reduce your Uncle to such a predicament as to extort a proper settlement for you  Geo  His not doing that is the reason I have discon∣tinued my visits to Miss Harland I could not bear the thoughts of her supposing I harbour'd a design upon her fortune and circumstanc'd as I am now may she not think so the nicelyfeeling heart foregoes the very happiness it seeks rather than enjoy it upon terms which bear the appearance of dishonour  Enter a Servant  Ser  There's a young woman Sir at the door de∣sires to speak with you  Exit  Servant  Geo  getting up  Then I'll go but I hope nothing will prevent our supping together  Mine  Depend upon meeting me at half past nine at the Grecian  Exit  George  What game has Fortune sprung for me Oh here she comes  Enter  Kitty  curtsying low  A charming wench by Jupiter sit down my loveI was just wishing for you the moment you came in  draws a couple of chairs  Kitty  You don't say so Sir  Mine  I was by those soft rolling azure twinklers  throwing his hand round her waist and looking fond∣ly in her face  Kitty  How you Gentlemen do like to flatter us poor Girls But to what I come about you must know Sir I am a Servant in Mr  Scrip's  family the great stockbroker I suppose you know him  Mine  Know him he's my intimate friend  Kitty  See what that is he told me as much I as∣sure you and moreover and above he told me besides it I made use of his name he's an old gentleman  Sir and knows nothing of the matter himself that you'd undertake to do a little business for me  Mine  That I will my dear girl as soon as ever you please  Kitty  There's above forty pounds sterling coming to me wages due to my poor father who was killed last war aboard the Rattle Snake and I can't get a farthing of it  Mine  Your father's wages I'll put you in a certain way of obtaining immediately In the mean time my sweet girl  Enter Servant  Ser  Mr Parchment the Conveyancer Sir  Mine  Dam'me I wish yon were both conveyed out of the window Why didn't you say I wasn't at home  Ser  He has some great business Sir for you to do  Mine  You should have told him I had my hands full Confound these chambers they're as public as WestminsterHall in Term time Shew him into the study  Exit Servant  Can't you meet me any where else my love  Kitty  I dar'n't Sir I shall lose my character  Mine  S'death and  ire this wench has gain'd such hold of me I can't part with her  muses  I have it I'll give her a letter to Mrs Modeley the Millener in BondStreet who shall artfully detain her at her house till I am able to go and see her in the evening Will you my dear sit down whilst I write a letter I want to give you  Kitty  Oh to be sure Sir  looking earnestly at  Mineall  as he writes  I think he's as comely a man as ever I saw only inclined to be a little ruddish or so Well I'm sure its very good of him to offer to take my little affair i  hands so readily  getting up and looking at his picture over his head in which he's drawn with his professional  and and long robe  Sure that can't be his picture over the door in a clergyman's band and big wig So pretty a face peeping through that great white  of a wig look  for all the  world like a peach growing out of a snowball But I hope Sir your letter is almost wrote for I'm rather in haste  Mine  having sealed his letter gets up  Yes my dear here it is you know BondStreet  Kitty  Very well Sir  Mine  Enquire for Mrs Modeley and Co the great Milliners in that street and deliver this letter into Mrs Modeley's own hands from Mr Mineall of the Temple  Kitty  Must I wait for an answer  Mine  Certainly  Kitty  Curtseying and looking down  I hope your honor isn't going to ask for your fee  Mine  Yes but I am I never fusser my fair clients to go away without paying me  Kisses her  Kitty  I never thought that it was so pleasant to go to law before  going she returns  but Sir Sir I for∣got to ask you whether this letter is wrote to get me what's due to my father  Mine  No my dear that letter was wrote to get you something that's due to yourself  Exeunt severally  SCENE III  SCRIP'S  House A library globes mathematical in∣struments and loose papers on a Table  Scrip  Discovered sitting in deep thought  I think I could make a devilish good bargain for myself and do my Country at the same time essential service  muses  Let me see let me see fourteen firstrate balloons each carrying twelve canonades ten bombs and four and twenty two and forty pounders Ay fourteen would do it Suppose I undertake to contract with Government for paying off the national debt on condition that they grant me and my heirs for ever an exclusive patent for the bombardment of Algiers The King of Spain would pay me treble the sum for the business But then suppose the King of Spain shou'd break his word with me a thing not uncom∣mon  when crown'd heads find it their interest so to do how am I to compel the King of Spain to pay me Dam'me if I undertake the business unless he gives me a mortgage on Peru or Mexico then there are two other dev'lish good contracts I might make to supply farmers with rain and confectioners with ice all the year round Besides I can now set the game laws at defiance no man can prove his title to a manor in the clouds but softly softly hav'n't we got a Chief Justice in Air ecod I believe he can take cognizance of these matters I must be very cauti∣ous how I  ceed 'till I know how  high up  his ju∣risdiction extends I must take care to be quite out of sight of the earth before I attempt to pursue a hare or meddle with venison It would vex a man confoundly at my time of life to be strung up for dear stealing in the clouds Here comes my sister Gram∣pus I'll consult her on the subject  Enter Mrs  Grampus  Mrs Gram  I am still brother of opinion that bo∣dies of a globular and rotund form are better calculat∣ed for celerity of motion than the cylindrical  Scrip  Upon that point sister we must ever disa∣gree Will you attempt to persuade me that bodies of a rotund and globular form like your own are so well calculated for celerity of motion as a smart Cylinder like me  Mrs Gram  I meant that such bodies possest more celerity of motion in ascending  Scrip  But you should have said in descending for instance sister is there a Balloon in France or Eng∣land wou'd take your weight up though yes I think a well constructed Montgolfier might take you up by way of ballast  Mrs Gram  I beg brother you'd let me explain the matter do but examine this drawing  takes him to the back of the stage where both stand examining a drawing seemingly with great attention  Enter Miss  Harland  and  Kitty  Miss Har  as she comes on  And his servant Dawson told you this story  Kitty  Mr Dawson himself ma'am and I gave him the guinea according to your desire  Miss Har  Then perhaps it was the money made him invent this story of the picture in hopes to get more by tales of the same complexion  Kitty  Not at all ma'am I pump'd the story out of him before I gave him a shilling and then I made him believe it was all out of my own pocket  Miss Har  You're a good girl Kitty but I can't spare you this evening to go with Mr Mineall's letter  Kitty  I don't know who in the family I can send with it every soul's employed about the Balloon ex∣cept old Agnes your ladyship's nurse  Miss Har  Then you must give her the letter  Kitty  It's very well I will ma'am and I'll give her at the same time charge enough to take care of it  Exit  Kitty  Miss Har  If this story Kitty has just told me be true all his extraordinary conduct has been from too much delicacy I know his uncle to be his sole dependance and perhaps he fears the old Gentleman's marriage may deprive him of that provision the expectation of which once made him consider himself my equal in regard to fortune I could almost find in my heart to be angry with him Poor George insensible must that heart be that would not sacrifice fortune to love  Scrip  and Mrs  Grampus  come forward both greatly agitated  Mrs Gram  I shall stick to the Globular  Scrip  And I shall stick to the Cylinder but Sophy shall decide between us  Mrs Gram  With all my heart  Miss  Harland shall be judge  Scrip  and Mrs  Grampus  get on each side of Miss  Harland  and shew the drawing  Observe this circular figure  Scrip  Do you mark this horizontal tube  Miss Har  If both speak at a time it will be im∣possible for me to attend to either  Scrip  Why look'e there she gives it against you already you won't let me speak  Mrs Gram  Was ever any thing so provoking have not I as good a right to speak first as you  Scrip  Why yes Sister I think you have the right of Seniority  Mrs Gram  in a violent rage  I'll not sleep another night in your house  Scrip  Then shall my family sleep the sounder you may quit my house when you willOff at a moment's warning you and your Balloon together  Mrs Gram  But I will convince  Miss  Harland be∣fore I go  takes hold of Miss  Harland's  hand ea∣gerly  Miss Har  Dear madam I beg you will not treat me with any kind of ceremony  Mrs Gram  interrupting her  If the weight of the atmosphere  Scrip  Weight of the atmospherefiddlededeeI say the power of gravity  Miss Har  I am sure I must possess an uncommon share of the power of gravity to keep my countenance I earnestly request you wou'd choose some other um∣pire to determine this dispute Were I to listen to you all day my poor capacity wou'd not enable me to settle the difference I perceive so equal a share of reason on both sides  Exit Miss  Harland  Quar  Without  There's no occasion I shall go up stairs without ceremony  Scrip  Here comes your lover Quarto I'll leave it to him  Mrs Gram  With all my heart and you yourself shall put the question to him  Enter  QUARTO  Scrip  My dear friend Quarto I rejoice to see you    Places  Quarto  between them    Love has given you a new binding and title page you look as rosy as Tur∣key  leather but without farther preface which bo∣dy do you think best calculated for celerity of motion a globe or a cylinder  Quar  A globe or a cylinderthe cylinder to be sure  Mrs Gram  And that's your opinion  Quar  By all means  Scrip  Now for it  Rubbing his hands with great glee  Mrs Cramp  So you think so  Quar  And don't you think so too  Mrs Gram  No I don't Why you stupid old coxcomb is the gaz of your understanding entirely evaporated do you possess so little science and reason as to maintain that a cylinder is a better shape for a balloon than a globe  Quar  As if recollecting  Oh it was for a bal∣loon you meant all this time that alters the case en∣tirely no my dear madam nothing can beat the globe for a balloon I would not venture up in a bal∣loon of any other shape for all the gold in the Ex∣chequer  Scrip  Aside  Mighty well old Turnabout I'll sweat you for this well there's an end of it Like three parts of the world without being convinc'd I am obliged to be satisfied but what's that you hinted of your not chusing to venture up in a balloon of any other shape  Quar  Not for the world  Scrip  But you wou'd have no kind of objection to ascend in one constructed upon my sister's principles  Quar  Objection no not absolutely objection that is to say if Mrs Grampus requested me to accom∣pany her  Mrs Gram  Dear Mr Quarto do not increase my chagrin by your gallant offer I must defer my curio∣sity till the invention is brought to more maturity  Scrip  Her weight won't do she broke the galleries of five balloons already but we never cou'd raise her above the garden wall now you're the very dandy for a voyage in the air  Quar  Aside  The devil I am Sure she won't be so unreasonable as to expect me to go  Scrip  Why you're as light as a man made of cork you'll go up like a rocket I don't believe you weigh a dozen cock sparrows  Mrs Gram  Consider the high fame it will give you it will make you live after you're dead  Quar  But I am one of those who like to live all the days of my life besides if I shou'd be seized with a fit of the gout  Scrip  Where could you find an easier chair than a balloon  Quar  Coughing violently  Then I am very shortwinded terribly afflicted with the asthma  Scrip  Nothing so good for you as the pure air of the upper regions it will clear your pipes and give you lungs like the bellows of an organ  Quar  It will be an organ confoundedly out of tune  Scrip  But come along let us shew you your fly∣ing car it lies at anchor now off the pigeonhouse  Quar  Aside  Oh that it were cast away in the horsepond but zounds my principal objection to going up is want of company I shou'dn't mind it a button if I had a couple of friends with me  Scrip  A couple of friends why did you suppose we were such savages as to send you up quite aloneno man Nicolini our fine large black tom cat shall go with you  Mrs Gram  And my sweet little shock spaniel Nero  Quar  Aside  Oh damn your little Nero you have the heart of Nero or you wou'd not press me to this undertaking  Mrs Gram  How I shall envy you when I see you above  Quar  And how I shall envy you when I see you below  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE IA GARDEN  Enter  GEORGE GORDON  and Miss  HARLAND  MISS HARLAND  I Only wish'd to ask you for my picture  Geo  I don't know any thing else I could have de∣nied you  Miss Har  But what signifies keeping the likeness when you set so little value on the original  Geo  So little value By every hope I have of hap∣piness there is nothing upon earth so truly valuable and precious to me but how must you interpret the addresses of a man with no certainty of fortune My uncle is on the point of marriage to be sure at pre∣sent the world considers me his heir but who can foresee the influence a wife may have on him  Miss Har  True happiness George does not de∣pend upon immense fortune where there is a suffici∣ent competency what matter on which side it is  Geo  My generous Sophia what shall I say to you whilst the charms of your person fill my bosom with new delight every moment I behold you the great∣ness of your mind breaks forth with superior lustre as if jealous of those external beauties which first won my admiration  Miss Har  Your friend Mineall seems zealously inte∣rested for you  Geo  I have already told you of his plan for breaking off my uncle's marriage with Mrs Grampus he is now dressing up Dawson as a German Baron and giv∣ing him every necessary instruction for performing his part with propriety  Miss Har  As the Baron is supposed to come from Vienna I don't think it would be a bad hint to make him profess himself an admirer of antiquated beauty only and in the true spirit of German gallantry look  more for wrinkles than dimples in the countenance of a mistress I observe that there are no characters so open to the grossest flattery as your learned ladies es∣pecially when the incense is offered them by a youth∣ful Corydon  Geo  An excellent thought I'll tell Dawson of it and he does not want understanding to improve the hint  Miss Har  Your plan is deficient in one particular your Baron should have brought a balloon with him and persuaded the widow he travelled from Germany in it  Geo  My uncle was in so great a hurry to be married we had not time to provide the balloon  Miss Har  And I fancy the widow will be so much of his opinion that you will have no occasion for it  Exeunt  George  and Miss  Harland  SCENE II  A Library  SCRIP QUARTO MINEALL  and Mrs  GRAMPUS Quarto  furnished with a huge fur Cap and a threadbare Surtout Coat  Quar  As he said that he had a great inclination to sleep when he got up high in the air I have furnish'd myself with a good warm nightcap  Mine  Are you mad if you give way to the drow∣siness which you will certainly find come over you it will be instant death  Quar  Oh lord oh lord oh lord  Scrip  You never will wake again  Quar  Wake againI don't think I'm awake at present all seems a dream to me  Scrip  Looking at  Quarto's  coat  But friend Quar∣to your great coat seems to partake of the quality of your nightcap it has a very sleepy appearance  Quar  But why a sleepy appearance Master Scrip  Scrip  Because I don't think it has had a nap these seven years But how far do you intend to go  Mrs Gram  Ay how far do you intend to go  Mine  That's a grand point    They all get eagerly round  Quarto  Quar  Why I was thinking when I had got as far as Highgate it wou'd be a pretty little voyage then I cou'd stop at the Horns and take a little refreshment to revive my old heart  Mrs Gram  What go no farther than Highgate  Scrip  I pique myself upon your pitching at least as far as Ware in Hertfordshire  Quar  You pique yourself upon my pitching as far as Ware in Hertfordshire Dam'me if you wou'dn't amongst you pique and pitch me to the Peak of old Nick in Derbyshire but where are my bold aeronauts the companions the partners of my voyage  Mrs Gram  Nero is ready at a moment's warning  Scrip  And I'll answer for't my whisker'd friend Tom Nicolini shall be forth coming  Quar  After a pause during which he walks about with ludicrous solemnity  Is my ballast lighter than it was and the roast goose stow'd safe in the balloon  Scrip  It is my friend  takes him by the hand  Quar  Get me some Holland's gin  Scrip  You shall have two bottles it is a cordial spirit and will much help you in the passage  Mrs Gram  And I'll provide the Holland's gin my∣self  Scrip  A better judge I know not  Mine  And I'll go and attend the filling the balloon  Exit  Mineall  Scrip  Now we're alone I've a secret charge to give you  Quar  Charge me no more I'm overcharg'd al∣ready  Scrip  A squiba crackera flash in the panthe spark of a rocketthe train of a mine to the grand plan I have to communicate a plan that will make my name as immortal as Isabella's of Castile and your's as that of the daring ColumbusDo you know what time of the moon it is  Quar  Why if I were to judge by your conversa∣tion I shou'd suppose it were at the full  Scrip  It was new moon yesterday the crescent will be visible this fine clear day about six o'clock in the evening the general rate of balloon travelling is at about thirty miles an hour the height of our at∣mosphere is just sixty miles and the devil's in it if the moon's atmosphere can be greater the entire jour∣ney making every allowance cannot exceed one hun∣dred and twenty miles Why not undertake it it is no more than going to Bath you'll perform it in four hours and when at your journey's end you have no more to do but tie a rope in a slip knot chuck it up∣on the horns of the moon and dangle there but one half hour dam'me if you won't have half the world gazing at you  Quar  So it's to the horns of the Moon you want me to travel I thought there was something ominous in the wind when you objected to my stopping at the Horns at Highgate  Scrip  But that's not all admitting which is a moral certainty that you meet a hospitable reception from your friends in the moon I dare say you'll meet a great many friends there lay in a fresh stock of provisions and take a tour all round the firmament You may first visit that most beautiful planet Venus and by the most easy transit in the world proceed next to Mercury I'd make interest with Jupiter to obtain his satellites by way of guards whilst I was on my travels and if I saw a convenient opportunity I'd steal Saturn's ring for the British Museum  Quar  But I was thinking all the time you were speaking what I should do for straw to burn  Scrip  musing as if greatly perplexed  For straw to burn For straw to burnYou have heard of the sky farmers cou'dn't they supply youI have it you shall take straw enough with you to go to the moon and back again and when you are in the moon you may speak to the man of it to hire Charles's wain for you and thus perform all the journey I have chalk∣ed out for you in a waggon  Quar  A devilish good thought besides if a wag∣gon is the only conveyance from star to star who knows but I may get a pension for introducing stage coaches  Scrip  Like enough you're not the first projector who has had a pension in the clouds  Enter  Mineall  Mine  Dear Sir your philosophic friend from Vi∣enna the celebrated Baron Bubblebergen is just arriv∣ed and eagerly enquires for you  Scrip  What my friend that I never saw yet though we have so long maintained a scientific cor∣respondence  Mine  The same it seems the information you sent him of your balloon has so wrought on his inquisitive spirit that he quitted his own country on purpose to go up in it  Quar  Huzza A reprieve A reprieve  Scrip  A reprieve What do you mean You know the balloon will take no more than one person  Quar  I know that but as the baron is a stranger I think it the height of good breeding to give him the first place in it He is waiting for youI'll not go up up until I hear his opinion on the matter  Mrs Gram  I'll wait on him this moment and luckily I have my balloon hat my balloon sack and my balloon apron on  Exit Mrs  Grampus  Scrip  Come away my little Quartoup we go is the word  Quar  Up we go I rather fear down we go is the world  Exeunt  Scrip  and  Quarto  Enter  George Gordon  Geo  Dear Frank how do we proceed  Mine  Like heroes in the bosom of victoryBut go you instantly and charge me a case of pistols with powder mind you put nothing but powder in them  Geo  A case of pistols charged with nothing but powder what can you possibly want with them  Mine  To fight a duel there is not a moment to be lost therefore do what I desire without asking another question Leave every thing to that zeal you know I have for your interest  Exit  Geo Gordon  Mine  Now if the old bookseller has but spunk enough about him to become jealous what between that passion and the more prevalent one of interest I think he may be worked up to send the baron a chal∣lenge as the last expiring struggle to regain his mis∣tress  walks about musing  Though hang it no no what can make a bookseller fight Not all the treatises in PaternosterRow  thoughtful  Let me see let me see I have hit the mark the Egyptian philosopher of whom he told me I will make him put on an inside waistcoat and persuade him it has been steeped in that great man's pickle until it became proof to the fire of a musquet bullet Ay zounds we'll make a pickled salamander of him  Enter  Kitty  Kitty  Lord Sir what were you saying about a sa∣lamander  Mine  I was saying my dear that if such a crea∣ture ever existed it must have been at a vast distance from such a pair of eyes as you possess But you sur∣prize me What answer have you brought to my let∣ter from Mrs Modeley  Kitty  I hope your honour won't be angry but I protest it wasn't in my power to go with it  Mine  Well and what have you done with my letter  Kitty  Oh I have sent it by a safe hand  Mine  Then you have sent it by another  Kitty  Ye  to be sure I wou'dn't disappoint you for the worldOld Agnes my young Lady's nurse has taken it and you cou'dn't have chose a more proper person for your purpose  Mine  So old Agnes the nurse has taken it  Kitty  Lord Sir yeswhat signifies who took the letter so the letter was takenWhat you wanted me  to do for ought I can see to the contrary an old wo∣man might have done as well as a young one  Exit  Kitty  Mine  So old Agnes the nurse has taken it If this story becomes public I shall be finely laughed at  Enter a  Millener  Mill  The whole family's in such confusion about the balloon that's to go off this evening I cannot meet a soul to give me a direct answer    approaching  Mineall  and addressing him    I'll ask this gentleman Pray Sir can you tell me if Mr Mineall is in the house  Mine  Yes my name is Mineallhave you any thing to say to me  Mill  I have a little bill to deliver you from Mrs Modeley the Millener in Bondstreet  Mine  A little bill you must be mistakenI don't owe Mrs Modeley any thing  Mill  It's for things for the Lady you sent with the letter to herYou desired in it she should be indulg∣ed with any thing she might take a fancy to  Mine  Takes the Bill  Oh It's for things for the lady I sent to her mighty well  Reads  Silk cloak gauze Mecklinburgh lace stockings six balloon caps two hats dittosum total fif∣teen pounds three shillings and six pence  a pretty morning's frolic I must confess but it's no mat∣ter I very richly deserve it  Puts his hand in his pocket  I hav'n't so much in my pocket I'll go bor∣row what I want of Georgecome this way if you please and I'll pay you  Going  Enter  Scrip  peeping in at the other side  Scrip  Come this way and  I'll  pay you  Mine  But she wants a Bill paid upon sight  Scrip  Upon sightwell upon sight let it bebut Mr Mineall Mr Mineall how can you be so unconscionable to keep all these pretty rogues to your∣self cou'dn't you spare one to a distrest friend  Mine  I assure you sir I can very well spare the one whose bill the person you see here has brought me  Scrip  Is she very pretty  Mine  Can you ask that question when I am going to pay money for her  Scrip  Egad I have a great mind to take her off your handsbut then she may be too young and when that's the case they are generally mere hoydens or simpletons  Mine  This lady is not too young I give you my word  Scrip  Then you think she has got all her eyeteeth about her  Mine  No faith I don't think she has  Scrip  Give me your hand and give me the bill at the same time  Mineall  gives him the bill    I'll pay it on condition you let me visit her in your stead  Mine  And this good woman shall conduct you to her immediately  Scrip  Where is shefor I burn with impatience to see her  Mine  Not a hundred yards offhere at Mrs Mode∣ley's the

deceitful than a crocodileis it thus at last that you reward your old your learned friend as you called me  hesitating and looking fondly  When I look in her face all my former tenderness returns What pleasure it gave me to mark her gradual pro∣gress in English grammar which I first put into her hand little did I think if she became an adjective she would ever be coupled with any substantive but myself  Mrs Gram  Really Mr Quarto you astonish me how have I merited this virulence of invective no∣thing that I recollect has ever passed between us but what was strictly within the bounds of Platonic friendship  Daw  Monsieur Quarto respondes moi answer me von little question  Quar  Ay and one big queston Mr Mounsieur  Daw  Connoisses vous qui Je suis Do you know who I am  Quar  They tell

sufficient influence to prevail on him to ascend in the balloon  Daw  Mort de ma vie Do not ask him me vil mount pour votre satisfaction  Mrs Gram  What and risque your precious life I will not hear it better a dozen booksellers should break their necks you must defer your gratification as well as myself but if he comes down safe who knows but you and I may have the pleasure of ascend∣ing in the same balloon together  Exit  Dawson  lead∣ing Mrs  Grampus  with great affected ceremony  Enter  Mineall  at the opposite side  Mineall  beckons to  Dawson  who hands Mrs  Grampus  off and returns

he'd come  Mine  Immediately  Quar  Did he seem frighten'd  Mine  No more than you are  Quar  Then he must certainly be a very brave fel∣low I almost think it a pity to quarrel with such a man don't you think it rather coldish  Buttoning his coat  Mine  Cold I think it uncommonly warm for the time of year  Quar  Still buttoning his coat 'till it's close up to his collar  I don't know how it is but I feel it very cold or I am going to be attacked with my old complaint  Mine  Your old complaint what's that  Quar  A slight touch of the Ague that attacks me now and then  Dawson  without sings Malbroc very loud  Quar  Zounds what a noise he makes he goes to fight like an Indian with the warwhoop  Mine  Oh here they come I'll measure out the ground  Mineall  strides across the stage as if measur∣ing the distance at which they are to stand  Quar  Measure the ground I conceit I have taken my measure already of the ground  Enter  Scrip  and  Dawson  Scrip  But listen to reason baron why not defer the duel 'till he returns from his voyage consider if you kill him what a fine experiment you'll spoil  Daw  Taking his ground  Me vil not hear von vord eh bien monsieur est vous pret est vous pret it be very high time begar you be pret  Quar  It's high time I should praywhy friend Mineall this bloody minded Baron makes sure of me But where am I to stand  Mine  putting him to his ground  Let the Baron remain where he is and do you stand here  Scrip  Now both discharge your pistols together  Quar  Hold Mr Baron I bar firing yet in that case both of us may be shot now I think the fairest way will be the old practice of duelling suppose we turn back to back then jump round and fire with our eyes shut  Scrip  I think the fairest way will be to hide the horse for the first shot  Daw  Me vil hide no vat you call horse so Mon∣sieur Quarto or Monsieur Folio or vat devil dey call you you may shoot first and me vil kill you in very god time after  Quar  Did you ever hear of such a blood thirsty dog now I declare I wouldn't wish to kill him tho' he seems to owe me such a spite and as these matters are frequently made up especially when the parties have come to the ground and behav'd so bravely as you must own the Baron and I have  Mine  Impossible things are now gone too far for any sort of accommodation  Enter  George Gordon  Geo  Where's my dear Uncle  Quar  Here my dear George  Daw  Eh bien pourquoivy you no fire  Quar  Don't be in a hurry Baron I wish to take leave of my Nephew nobody knows what may hap∣pen  Geo  Dear Sir don't you fight him I'll take the quarrel upon myself  Quar  My dear boy you don't say so  takes his hand  Geo  My life's of no consequence  Quar  None in the worldthen perhaps George you will go up in the Balloon for me too  Geo  Most chearfully Sir so if you give me your pistol  Quar  Here it is  gives his pistol  but take care it's cock'dlet me ge get out of the way before you fire  Mine  But hold Mr Gordon in case you should kill the Baron you must fly the country then what security has your Uncle given to make a proper pro∣vision for your support during your banishment  Quar  Don't let that stop the duel I'll make over my estate in Shropshire to him and besides bequeath him every shilling I die possess'd of  Mine  You hear what he says Mr Scrip and there∣fore with his own consent I deliver the title deeds of his Shropshire property into the hands of Mr Gor∣don  Gives  George  the Parchments  Quar  Now for it George let him see he has a man of mettle to deal with mind you have the first shot but be sure you take good aim Come Baron are you ready I long to see them pop at each other I never saw a duel in my life  Dawson  begins to un∣dress    Scrip  Zounds Baron what are you uncasing for are you a going to treat us to a boxing match  Quar  A boxing match oh you low lived cow∣ardly rascal you ragamuffin is it come to this at last if I thought this was his way I could have box'd him myself stand back George I'll fight this duel my∣self let every man fight his own battles  strips  this is some German valet de chambre  Daw  turning round  An English valet de cham∣bre Sir at your service I hope Sir you wouldn't have me shoot my master  Quar  Shoot your master as I live that impudent dog Dawson why Mineall is this a trick of yours  Scrip  Ask him no questions he has play'd me a worse trick and in the true spirit of a lawyer made me pay for it  Quar  Ay prithee what has he done  Scrip  Not much only sold me an old hen for a young pullet I paid neat twenty pounds in hard cash for the sight of a young Venus as he made me be∣lieve  but when I saw her dam'me if she wasn't old enough to be my grandmother  Mine  It was a disappointment to both parties and as one of us must have paid for it I thought you could best afford it  Scrip  Pretty comfort this I must confess  Enter Mrs  Grampus  and Miss  Harland  Mrs Gram  Where is my dear Baron I hope he is not wounded beyond all cure  Quar  No Ma'am there he is Baron Dawson of Dawson's Pantry at your service far from being wounded beyond the power of cure but I can assure you at the same time that I am cured beyond the pow∣er of your ever wounding me  Scrip  Sister sister I'm ashamed of youa woman at your time of life to have such a colt's tooth  Quar  Well instead of thinking of a wife myself if Miss Harland will honour my nephew George with her hand I will immediately make such further settle∣ment on him as will place him every way on a foot∣ing with her in regard to fortune  Miss Har  Sir your nephew's merit needs no ad∣ventitious aid from fortune and I do not blush to own my partiality for him before I was acquainted with your generous intention  Quar  By this light you're a noble girl and as you're shortly to be a near relation of mine I will ha  e a buss to our better acquaintance    Kisses Miss  Harland  Scrip  Well my little Quarto give me your hand I congratulate you on slipping your neck so dextrously out of the matrimonial noose But come every thing is ready and your flying man of war expects you    Pulling  Quarto  by the arm to the back of the stage where the balloon is seen    Quar  I must beg to be excused the magnet has lost its power that was to have drawn me to the clouds  Scrip  Curs'd unlucky this but Dawson what will you take to go up  Daw  Take Sir Ecod I fancy I should take my death  Scrip  Dam'me if I hav'n't a great mind to go up myself tho' upon second thoughts it would be rather imprudent for if I be seiz'd with the rheumatism in my shoulders I shall not be able to use either my oars or my wings  Mine  I earnestly request Mr Scrip that you would lay both your oars and your wings aside for the rest of the day and join in the happiness of my friend George and his lovely Sophia I know no feeling so grateful to the human heart as to reflect we have suc∣ceeded in our most interesting attempt and there is nothing now wanting  addressing the audience  but your support and protection to elevate us without the aid of Aerostation  THE END
