BAPTISTA  _THUS have I 'gainst my own SelfInterest  Repeated all the worst you are t'expect  From my shrewd Daughter  Cath'rine  if you'll venture  Maugre my plain and honest Declaration  You have my free Consent win her and wed her  PETRUCHIO  Signior  Baptista  thus it stands with me  Anthonio  my Father is deceased  You knew him well and knowing him know me  Left solely Heir to all his Lands and Goods  Which I have better'd rather than decreas'd  And I have thrust myself into the World  Haply to wive and thrive as best I may  My Business asketh Haste old Signior  And ev'ry Day I cannot come to wooe  Let Specialties be therefore drawn between us  That Cov'nants may be kept on either Hand  BAPTISTA  Yes when the special Thing is well obtain'd  My Daughter's Love for that is all in all  PETRUCHIO  Why that is nothing for I tell you Father  I am as peremptory as she proudminded  And where two raging Fires meet together  They do consume the Thing that feeds their Fury  Tho' little Fire grows great with little Wind  Yet extreme Gusts will blow out Fire and all  So I to her and so she yields to me  For I am rough and wooe not like a Babe  GRUMIO  Nay look you Sir he tells you flatly what his Mind is Why give him Gold enough and marry him to a Puppet or an old Trot with ne'er a Tooth in her Head Tho' she have as many Diseases as two and fifty Horses why nothing comes amiss so Money comes withal  BAPTISTA  As I have shew'd you Sir the coarser Side  Now let me tell you she is young and beauteous  Brought up as best becomes a Gentlewoman  Her only Fault and that is Fault enough  s that she is intolerably froward  f that you can away with she is yours  GRUMIO  I pray you Sir let him see her while the Humour lasts O'my Word an' she knew him as well as I do she would think Scolding would do little Good upon him She may perhaps call him half a Score Knaves or so why that's nothing an' he begin once she'll find her Match I'll tell you what Sir an' she stand him but a little he will throw a Figure in her Face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more Eyes to see withal than a CatYou know him not Sir  BAPTISTA  And will you woo her Sir  PETRUCHIO  Why came I hither but to that Intent  Think you a little Din can daunt my Ears  Have I not in my Time heard Lions roar  Have I not heard the Sea puff'd up with Winds  Have I not heard great Ord'nance in the Field  And Heav'n's Artillery thunder in the Skies  Have I not in a pitched Battle heard  Loud 'Larums neighing Steeds and Trumpets clangue  And do you tell me of a Woman's Tongue  That gives not half so great a Blow to hear  As will a Chesnut in a Farmer's Fire  Tush tush scare Boys with Bugs  BAPTISTA  Then thou'rt the Man  The Man for  Cath'rine  and her Father too  That shall she know and know my Mind at once  I'll portion her above her gentler Sister  Newmarried to  Hortensio  And if with scurril Taunt and squeamish Pride  She make a Mouth and will not taste her Fortune  I'll turn her sorth to seek it in the World  Nor henceforth shall she know her Father's Doors  PETRUCHIO  Say'st thou me so Then as your Daughter Signior  Is rich enough to be  Petruchio  's Wife  Be she as curst as  Socrates' Zantippe    She moves me not a WhitWere she as rough  As are the swelling  Adriatick  Seas  I come to wive it wealthily in  Padua    If wealthily then happily in  Padua  BAPTISTA  Well may'st thou wooe and happy be thy Speed  But be thou arm'd for some unhappy Words  PETRUCHIO  Aye to the Proof as Mountains are for Winds  That shake not tho' they blow perpetually  Catharine  and the  Musicmaster  make a Noise within  MUSICMASTER Within  Help help  CATHARINE within  Out of the House you scraping Fool  PETRUCHIO  What Noise is that  BAPTISTA  Oh nothing this is nothing  My Daughter  Catharine  and her Musicmaster  This is the third I've had within this Month  She is an Enemy to Harmony  Enter  MUSICKMASTER  How now Friend why dost look so pale  MUSICKMASTER  For Fear I promise you if I do look pale  BAPTISTA  What will my Daughter prove a good Musician  MUSICMASTER  I think she'll sooner prove a Soldier  Iron may hold with her but never Lutes  BAPTISTA  Why then thou canst not break her to the Lute  MUSICMASTER  Why no for she hath broke the Lute to me  I did but tell her she mistook her Frets  And bow'd her Hand to teach her fingering  When with a most impatient devilish Spirit  Frets call you them quoth she I'll fret your Fool's Cap  And with that Word she struck me on the Head  And through the Instrument my Pate made way  And there I stood amazed for awhile  As on a Pillory looking thro' the Lute  While she did call me Rascalfidler  And twangling Jack with twenty such vile Terms  As she had studied to misuse me so  PETRUCHIO  Now by the World it is a lusty Wench  I love her ten times more than e'er I did  Oh how I long to have a Grapple with her  MUSICMASTER  I wou'd not make another Trial with her  To purchase  Padua  for what is past  I'm paid sufficiently If at your Leisure  You think my broken Fortunes Head and Lute  Deserve some Reparation you know where  T'enquire for me and so good Gentlemen  I am your much disorder'd humble Servant  Exit  BAPTISTA  Not yet mov'd  Petruchio  do you flinch  PETRUCHIO  I am more and more impatient Sir and long  To be a Part'ner in these favourite Pleasures  BAPTISTA  O by all Means SirWill you go with me  Or shall I send my Daughter  Kate  to you  PETRUCHIO  I pray you do I will attend her here  Exit  Bap  Grumio  retire and wait my Call within  Exit  Grum  Since that her Father is so resolute  I'll wooe her with some Spirit when she comes  Say that she rail why then I'll tell her plain  She sings as sweetly as a Nightingale  Say that she frown I'll say she looks as clear  As Morning Roses newly wash'd with Dew  Say she be mute and will not speak a Word  Then I'll commend her Volubility  And say she uttereth piercing Eloquence  If she do bid me pack I'll give her Thanks  As tho' she bid me stay by her a Week  If she deny to wed I'll crave the Day  When I shall ask the Banes and when be married  But here she comes and now  Petruchio  speak  Enter  CATHARINE  CATHARINE  How turn'd adrift nor know my Father's House  Reduc'd to this or none the Maid's last Prayer  Sent to be woo'd like Bear unto the Stake  Trim wooing like to beand he the Bear  For I shall bait himyet the Man's a Man  PETRUCHIO  Kate  in a CalmMaids must not be Wooers  Good Morrow  Kate  for that's your Name I hear  CATHARINE  Well have you heard but impudently said  They call me  Catharine  that do talk of me  PETRUCHIO  You lie in Faith for you are call'd plain  Kate    And bonny  Kate  and sometimes  Kate  the curst  But  Kate  The prettiest  Kate  in  Christendom  Take this of me  Kate  of my Consolation  Hearing thy Mildness prais'd in ev'ry Town  Thy Virtues spoke of and thy Beauty sounded  Thy Affability and bashful Modesty  Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs  Myself am mov'd to wooe thee for my Wife  CATHARINE  Mov'd in good Time let him that mov'd you hither  Remove you hence I knew you at the first  You were a Moveable  PETRUCHIO  A Moveable Why what's that  CATHARINE  A JointStool  PETRUCHIO  Thou hast hit it come sit on me  CATHARINE  Asses are made to bear and so are you  PETRUCHIO  Women are made to bear and so are you  Alass good  Kate  I will not burthen thee  For knowing thee to be but young and light  CATHARINE  Too light for such a Swain as you to catch  Going  PETRUCHIO  Come come you Wasp i'faith you are too angry  CATHARINE  If I be waspish 'best beware my Sting  PETRUCHIO  My Remedy then is to pluck it out  CATHARINE  Ay if the Fool cou'd find it where it lies  PETRUCHIO  The Fool knows where the Honey is sweet  Kate  Offers to kiss her  CATHARINE  'Tis not for Drones to taste  PETRUCHIO  That will I try  She strikes him  I swear I'll cuff you if you strike again  Nay come  Kate  come you must not look so sower  CATHARINE  How can I help it when I see that Face  But I'll be shock'd no longer with the Sight  Going  PETRUCHIO  Nay hear you  Kate  in sooth you 'scape not so  CATHARINE  I chafe you if I tarry let me go  PETRUCHIO  No not a Whit I find you passing gentle  'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen  And now I find Report a very Liar  For thou art pleasant gamesome passing courteous  But slow in Speech yet sweet as springtime Flowers  Thou can'st not frown thou can'st not look ascance  Nor bite the Lip as angry Wenches will  Nor hast thou Pleasure to be cross in Talk  But thou with Mildness entertain'st thy Wooers  With gentle Conf'rence soft and affable  CATHARINE  This is beyond all Patience don't provoke me  PETRUCHIO  Why doth the World report that  Kate  doth limp  Oh sland'rous World  Kate  like the Hazle Twig  Is strait and slender and as brown in Hue  As Hazle Nuts and sweeter than the Kernels  O let me see thee walk thou do'st not halt  CATHARINE  Go Fool and whom thou keep'st command  PETRUCHIO  Did ever  Dian'  so become a Grove  As  Kate  this Chamber with her princely Gaite  Oh be thou  Dian'  and let her be  Kate    And then let  Kate  be chaste and  Dian'  sportful  CATHARINE  Where did you Study all this goodly Speech  PETRUCHIO  It is  extempore  from my Mother Wit  CATHARINE  A witty Mother witless else her Son  PETRUCHIO  Am I not wise  CATHARINE  Yes in your own Conceit  Keep yourself warm with that or else you'll freeze  PETRUCHIO  Or rather warm me in thy Arms my  Kate  And therefore setting all this Chat aside  Thus in plain Terms your Father hath consented  That you shall be my Wife your Dowry 'greed on  And will you nill you I will marry you  CATHARINE  Whether I will or noO Fortune's Spite  PETRUCHIO  Nay  Kate  I am a Husband for your Turn  For by this Light whereby I see thy Beauty  Thy Beauty that doth make me like thee well  Thou must be married to no Man but me  For I am he am born to tame you  Kate  CATHARINE  That will admit Dispute my saucy Groom  PETRUCHIO  Here comes your Father never make Denial  I must and will have  Catharine  to my Wife  Enter  BAPTISTA  BAPTISTA  Now Signior now how speed you with my Daughter  PETRUCHIO  How shou'd I speed but well Sir how but well  It were impossible I should speed amiss  BAPTISTA  Why how now Daughter  Catharine  in your Dumps  CATHARINE  Call you me Daughter Now I promise you  You've shew'd a tender Fatherly Regard  To wish me wed to one half lunatick  A Madcap Ruffian and a swearing Jack  That thinks with Oaths to face the Matter out  BAPTISTA  Better this Jack than starve and that's your Portion  PETRUCHIO  Father 'tis thus yourself and all the World  That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her  If she be curst it is for Policy  For she's not froward but modest as the Dove  She is not hot but temperate as the Morn  For Patience she will prove a second  Grissel    And  Roman Lucrece  for her Chastity  And to conclude we've 'greed so well together  We have fix'd tomorrow for the Weddingday  CATHARINE  I'll see thee hang'd Tomorrow firstTomorrow  BAPTISTA  Petruchio  hark she says she'll see thee hang'd first  Is this your Speeding  PETRUCHIO  Oh

I'll marry my Revenge but I will tame him  Aside  PETRUCHIO  I tell you 'tis incredible to believe  How much she loves me Oh the kindest  Kate  She hung about my Neck and Kiss on Kiss  She vy'd so fast protesting Oath on Oath  That in a Twink she won me to her Love  Oh you are Novices 'tis a World to see  How tame when Men and Women are alone  Give me thy Hand  Kate  I will now away  To buy Apparel for my gentle Bride  Father provide the Feast and bid the Guests  BAPTISTA  What dost thou say my  Catharine  Give thy Hand  CATHARINE  Never to Man shall  Cath'rine  give her Hand  Here 'tis and let him take it an' he dare  PETRUCHIO  Were it the Forefoot of an angry Bear  I'd shake it off but as it is  Kate  's I kiss it  CATHARINE  You'll kiss it closer e'er our Moon be wain'd  BAPTISTA  Heav'n send you Joy  Petruchio  'tis a Match  PETRUCHIO  Father and Wife adieu I must away  Unto my Countryhouse and stir my Grooms  Scower their Countryrust and make 'em fine  For the Reception of my  Catharine  We will have Rings and Things and fine Array  Tomorrow  Kate  shall be our Weddingday  Exit  Petruchio  BAPTISTA  Well Daughter tho' the Man be somewhat wild  And thereto frantic yet

Hast no Trick behind  I'll take thee at thy Word and send t'invite  My Soninlaw  Hortensio  and thy Sister  And all our Friends to grace thy Nuptials  Kate  Exit  Baptista  CATHARINE  Why yes Sister  Bianca  now shall see  The poor abandon'd  Cath'rine  as she calls me  Can hold her Head as high and be as proud  And make her Husband stoop unto her Lure  As she or e'er a Wife in  Padua  As double as my Portion be my Scorn  Look to your Seat  Petruchio  or I throw you  Cath'rine  shall tame this Haggardor if she fails  Shall tye her Tongue up and pare down her Nails  Exit  Catharine  ACT II  Enter  BAPTISTA    HORTENSIO    CATHARINE    BIANCA  and  Attendants  BAPTISTA  SIGNIOR  Hortensio  this is the 'pointed Day  That  Cath'rine  and  Petruchio  should be married  And yet we hear not of our Soninlaw  What will be said what Mockery will it be  To want the Bridegroom when the Priest attends  To speak the ceremonial Rites of Marriage  What says  Hortensio  to this Shame of ours  CATHARINE  No Shame but mine I must forsooth be forc'd  To give my Hand oppos'd against my Heart  Unto a madbrain Rudesby full of Spleen  Who woo'd in Haste and means to wed at Leisure  I told you I he was a frantick Fool  Hiding his bitter Jests in blunt Behaviour  And to be noted for a merry Man  He'll wooe a Thousand 'point the Day of Marriage  Make Friends invite yea and proclaim the Banes  Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd  Now must the World point at poor  Catharine    And say lo there is mad  Petruchio  's Wife  If it would please him come and marry her  BIANCA  Such hasty Matches seldom end in Good  HORTENSIO  Patience good  Cath'rine  and  Bianca  too  Upon my Life  Petruchio  means but well  Whatever Fortune stays him from his Word  Tho' he be blunt I know him

comfort her  Exit  Bianca  I cannot blame thee now to weep and rage  For such an Injury would vex a Saint  Much more a Shrew of thy impatient Humour  HORTENSIO  Was ever Match clapt up so suddenly  BAPTISTA  Hortensio  faith I play a Merchant's Part  And venture madly on a desp'rate Mart  HORTENSIO  'Twas a Commodity lay fretting by you  'Twill bring you Gain or perish on the Seas  BAPTISTA  The

buckled another lac'd an old rusty Sword ta'en out of the Town Armory with a broken Hilt and chapeless with two broken Points his Horse hip'd with an old mothy Saddle the Stirrups of no Kindred besides possess'd with the Glanders and like to mose in the Chine troubled with the Lampasse insected with the Farcy full of Windgalls sped with  Spavins raied with the Yellows past Cure of the Fives stark spoiled with the Staggers begnawn with the Bots waid in the Back and Shoulder shotten near legg'd before and with a half check'd Bit and a Headstall of Sheepleather which being restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been often burst and now repaired with Knots one girt six Times piec'd and a Woman's Crupper of Velure which hath two Letters for her Name fairly set down in Studs and here and there piec'd with Packthread  BAPTISTA  Who comes with him  BIONDELLO  O Sir his Laquey for all the World caparison'd like the Horse with a Linnen Stock on one Leg and a Kersey Boot Hose on the other gartered with a Red and Blue List an old Hat and the Humour of forty Fancies prick'd upon it for a Feather a Monster a very Monster in Apparel and not like a Christian FootBoy or a

Book and Book and Priest  Now take them up quoth he if any list  PEDRO  What said the Wench when he rose up again  BIONDELLO  Trembled and shook for why he stamp'd and swore  As if the Vicar went to cozen him  But after many Ceremonies done  He calls for Wine a Health quoth he as if  H'ad been aboard carousing to his Mates  After a Storm quafft of the Muscadel  And threw the Sops all in the Sexton's Face  Having no other Cause but that his Beard  Grew thin and hungerly and seem'd to ask  His Sops as he was drinking This done he took  The Bride about the Neck and kiss'd her Lips  With such a clamorous Smack that at the Parting  All the Church echo'd and I seeing this  Came thence for very Shame and after me  I know the Rout is coming  Such a mad Marriage never was before  Musick

Parents of so fair a Child  Happier the Man whom favourable Stars  Allot thee for his lovely Bedfellow  BIANCA  What Mummery is this  PETRUCHIO  Why how now  Kate  I hope thou art not mad  This is  Baptista  our old reverent Father  And not a Maiden as thou sayst he is  CATHARINE  Pardon dear Father my mistaken Eyes  That have heen so bedazled with the Sun  That every thing I look on seemeth Green  Now I perceive thou art my reverent Father  Pardon I pray thee for my mad mistaking  Kneels  BAPTISTA  Rise rise my Child what strange Vigary's this  I came to see thee with my Son and Daughter  How lik'st thou Wedlock Ar't not alter'd  Kate  CATHARINE  Indeed I am I am transform'd to Stone  PETRUCHIO  Chang'd for the better much ar't not my  Kate  CATHARINE  So good a Master cannot chuse

have our Will  PETRUCHIO  Peace Brawler Peace  Or I will give the meek  Hortensio    Your Husband there my taming Recipe  BIANCA  Lord never let me have a Cause to sigh  'Till I be brought to such a silly Pass  GRUMIO  to  BAPTISTA  Did I not promise you Sir my Master's Dicipline wou'd work Miracles  BAPTISTA  I scarce believe my Eyes and Ears  BIANCA  His Eyes and Ears had felt these Fingers

mocking we will have no telling  PETRUCHIO  Come on I say  BIANCA  She shall not  HORTENSIO  Let us hear for both our Sakes good Wife  PETRUCHIO  Catharine  begin  CATHARINE  Fie fie unknit that threatning unkind Brow  And dart not scornful Glances from those Eyes  To wound thy Lord thy King thy Governor  It blots thy Beauty as Frosts bite the Meads  Confounds thy Fame as Whirlwinds shake fair Buds  And in no Sense is meet or amiable  PETRUCHIO  Why well said  Kate  CATHARINE  A Woman mov'd is like a Fountain troubled  Muddy illseeming thick berest of Beauty  And while it is so none so dry or thirsty  Will dain to sip or touch a Drop of it  BIANCA  Sister be quiet  PETRUCHIO  Nay learn you that LessonOn on I say  CATHARINE  Thy Husband is thy Lord thy Life thy Keeper  Thy Head thy Sovereign one that cares for thee  And for thy Maintainance Commits his Body  To painful Labour both by Sea and Land  To watch the Night in Storms the Day in Cold  While thou ly'st warm at home secure and safe  And craves no other Tribute at thy Hands  But Love fair Looks and true Obedience  Too little Payment for so great a Debt  BAPTISTA  Now fair befall thee Son  Petruchio    The Battle's won and thou can'st keep the Field  PETRUCHIO  Oh fear me not  BAPTISTA  Then my now gentle  Cath'rine    Go home with me along and I will add  Another Dowry to another Daughter  For thou art changed as thou hadst never been  PETRUCHIO  My Fortune is sufficient Here's my Wealth  Kiss me my  Kate  and since thou art become  So prudent kind and dutiful a Wife  Petruchio  here shall doff the lordly Husband  An honest Mask which I throw off with Pleasure  Far hence all Rudeness Wilfulness and Noise  And be our future Lives one gentle Stream  Of mutual Love Compliance and Regard  CATHARINE  Nay then I'm all unworthy of thy Love  And look with Blushes on my former self  PETRUCHIO  Good  Kate  no morethis is beyond my Hopes  Goes forward with  Catharine  in his Hand  Such Duty as the Subject owes the Prince  Even such a Woman oweth to her Husband  And when she's froward peevish sullen sower  And not obedient to his honest Will  What is she but a foul contending Rebel  And graceless Traitor to her loving Lord  How shameful 'tis when Women are so simple  To offer War where they should kneel for Peace  Or seek for Rule Supremacy and Sway  Where bound to love to honour and obey
