 Occasional Observations ON THE CIVILLIST REVENUE  Price SixPence  Occasional Observations ON A DOUBLETITLEDPAPER ABOUT THE CLEAR PRODUCE OF THE CIVILLIST REVENUE From Midsummer to Midsummer last  LONDON Printed and Sold by M COOPER at the Globe in PaterNosterRow M DCC LXI  Occasional Observations  c  _THERE is nothing so difficult as writing on a subject laid before you in vague terms which have a doubledesign'd meaning Ambiguities must arise and therefore must be excus'd  I shall first consider the paper I am to treat of under its title of  The account of the clear produce in every year  that is of what is paid in of the civillist in every year on or before the very Midsummerday on which it was due  This account was humbly presented to Parliament without any one voucher from the offices of revenue and is the first instance of the kind some sort of vouchers for appearance at least having been always produc'd on the like occasions This is made up only from the treasury books of the receipt within every single year  When the first demand was made for a deficiency of the civillist for the account of that year's receipt was stated at no more than  l  This new account of years states the receipt of that year at  l  This difference is itself a proof of false accounts delivered into Parliament at that time to defraud the nation It is now publickly acknowledged that this difference of  l  was neither a deficiency nor an arrear standing out at Midsummerday consequently  l  being the remainder of  l  deducted from  l  was the whole then wanting to complete the latter sum clear to his Majesty that very day it was due yet the nation was obliged to give the crown  l  for the arrears which had at first been demanded as a deficiency in the produce  This false account stands in the printed journals of  Page  but by the late new account is fully detected in a surprizing able and  masterly manner Yet this was cramm'd down the whole legislature which enacted that there was an arrear of  l  and for the glory of those times it stands recorded in our statutes to posterity  In the new account the year is said to have produc'd but  l  In the same account the year produces as set down already  l  consequently produces but  l  more than Now it appear'd upon the examination of the committee in April that over and above the  l  receiv'd to the very Midsummerday there had been since receiv'd on account of that year's pretended deficient civillist  l  by the April following and that there still remained arrears standing out in the customs and in the hands of the country postmasters  l  These three last mention'd sums amount to  l  besides the  l  given for an arrear and yet the next year stands charged with a produce but of  l  more than the preceeding  I answer not for the veracity of any accounts and I must confess I have not the most implicit faith in the treasury accounts when I consider for how many years the revenue of the hawkers and pedlars escap'd them and for how many more the Â½  per cent  levied in Barbadoes and the Leewardislands Nor could I be surprised if now and then a whole month's revenue of the civillist should escape but for the present I will acknowledge that the Virginia quitrents were most properly and with the  nicest oeconomy  dispos'd of for his majesty's  special service  It has been mention'd that the money receiv'd at the Exchequer for the year was  l  Now the  l  for arrears was paid in there that year and therefore ought to have appear'd and been added to the produce of that year and over and above the  l  it must be remembered too that from they had in advance the difference between the pretended produce that year of  l  and the real produce of  l  to answer any  future arrears But perhaps treasury books may look on the  l  as a free gift only and it may appear  there as very properly dispos'd of in that shape again  This years account says there was receiv'd by the excise for the year the sum of  l  but when the deficiency for that year was demanded it was charg'd with the produce of  l  only It was afterwards prov'd that there had been paid to the late Queen within that time  l  which added to the above  l  makes a sum of  l  still  l  is wanting to make up the  l  It is probable that without foreseeing the consequences the sum of  l  remaining in the Exchequer at Midsummer for the civillist lottery of may be included in the above  l  though no notice is taken of it in this new account but then there will be still wanting  l  to make the total of the said clear produce in that year as now deliver'd in agree with the same article laid before the committee in upon the subject of the then deficiency of  l  This short  detail is given only as an instance of these inaccurate accounts  It would be tedious and endless to make all the proper observations on this long period of accounts I shall therefore confine myself to that second most extraordinary and delicate performance I mean the account for the pretended deficiencies in the duties and revenues for seven years back at Midsummer amounting to no less than  l  What a play of words is here The duties and revenues are one thing the art of making up accounts of the receipts only between Midsummer and Midsummer without regard to the arrears either of that or of former years is another thing Was not this sufficiently expos'd in the examination into the  l  deficiency of Why have they not now deliver'd to Parliament a state of the clear produce of these revenues for the whole years Why play'd the old exploded game fixing the title call'd for on the outside of the paper and another title within relating to the clear produce of each year  in every year  But had it been now deliver'd under the genuine  title it was call'd for which is An account of the clear produce of the several branches of the revenue  c  which implies not only the receipts to each Midsummerday but all arrears outstanding and afterwards receiv'd it might have appear'd that in the two former instances of deficiencies the arrears in those two periods added to the receipts given in would have been a redundance in and far short of  l  demanded in by which means the grossness of the impositions then would have appear'd in too glaring a light  What were the methods taken to cover such extraordinary impositions It was to call for the accounts from the several officers of revenue to be laid before Parliament under the proper titles and then to give private orders to those officers to make those accounts up in a direct contrary way This was discover'd and prov'd by the commissioners themselves of the several offices on their examination before the committee in the case of the first pretended deficiency of  l  and was expressly confirmed by the letter of a person in authority giving such private  orders and produc'd by a principal officer of the revenue in his own justification  In the case of the second deficiency in which had a retrospect of years the only way that remain'd was the hope that the novelty and surprize of it would carry itself and not be liable to any detection from the offices The Treasury therefore were fully resolv'd to make up the account from their own books a precedent we see follow'd in this years account for who could detect them there Accordingly they deliver'd the accounts from their books as of a certain round deficiency of duties and revenue  But to carry on some shew of proper vouchers as usual they sent their orders to the Customs Excise and Postoffice to know what sums they had applied out of their several branches by virtue of standing warrants from the Treasury during this period of years To have ask'd of them as usual what was the real produce of those revenues in that period however necessary and proper for the public was the very thing  which the Treasury desir'd should not be known To make up an account from their own books was sufficient for their purpose Yet the producing something from those offices would carry a plausible appearance and be an aid to imposition They therefore ridiculously produc'd certificates from these several offices of the payments issued by them upon the establish'd warrants as if the Treasury could be suppos'd ignorant of such payments and at the same time pretend to know the produce of those revenues from their own books without the assistance of the commissioners It may be indeed that these curious books of account take no other notice of the produce in every year but what they have the expenditure of in every year and that the rest is left to auditor's accounting But does there not now arise a difficulty as to this years account Has any application been made to all or any one of the offices for the least information respecting the produce of the civillist revenue  I shall now compare some other particulars in this new account with what was formerly deliver'd  when the deficiencies were in question before Parliament in order to shew the inaccuracy of treasurybooks I begin with the land rents  Whatever sums the receivers pay upon treasury warrants is as much part of the produce as the balances they pay into the Exchequer after such warrants have been satisfied and are equally applicable to the intent of a civillist as those balances it being to support and maintain the honour and dignity of the crown In the years account these rents produce but  l  in the years and whereas it appears by the Exchequer vouchers relating to the years pretended deficiency that those years had produc'd  l  A small difference indeed of  l  in so small an article and much to the credit of the new account's correctness and it must be observ'd that the treasurybooks only can give an account of what the receivers had paid on warrants drawn by themselves exclusive of the monies paid by them into the Exchequer I cannot conclude this paragraph without observing that in  the first year of the the produce of the excise was given in at the time that immense deficiency was claim'd at  l  whereas in the new years account it stands at no more than  l  Another small difference of  l  between two treasury accounts of the same article in the same year  When the accounts for these pretended  See the printed Journal page  deficiencies of duties and revenue for years were perused they were found not satisfactory other accounts were called for from the several offices of the revenue and were delivered to the House by them they are verily curious and literaly fulfil what the Lords say in their protest the th of May against the  l  "When we reflect in what manner these accounts have been made up and in what manner they have been brought in we cannot but apprehend that a door is opened by this precedent for laying new and excessive charges on the nation the revenues appropriated to the uses of his Majesty's civillist are subject  in their own nature to vary and even when there is no deficiency in the produce there may be arrears in the receipt These arrears may easily be increased by the management of designing ministers by private directions to receivers and by artful methods of stating accounts from all which we cannot but apprehend that now this precedent is made we may have frequent accounts of arrears"  These accounts from the Customs Excise and Postoffice have no regard to the arrears standing out on Midsummer which probably were about the sum of  l  as they were about that sum at Midsummer and whatever sum they were ought to be reckon'd in aid of the deficiency of the seven years  The accounts of the customs are from Christmas to They say "the account of the Customs are made up from Christmas to Christmas so that this account could not be given from Midsummer to Midsummer" they likewise say "It is impossible to shew what has been paid since Christmas of  the produce of the above years because there is no distinction in the payments whether for arrears or growing receipts"  This is roundly asserted but then how came it that they could in make up an account of the produce from Midsummer to Midsummer and how did it happen that they could then make up the account of the arrears received since Midsummer and paid into the Exchequer to the amount of  l  To account for the differences between the accounts there was a most ridiculous explanation given of them in a paper from the Treasury I don't mean a publick one it relates that this revenue produced as  certified from the Exchequer    l  and that the Comptroller of the Customs account "for the seven years ended at Christmas when he made up the net produce to be  l  from which deduct the payments to the Prince of Wales  l  leaves  l  the difference between these two accounts is little more than  l  but as one is an account  of a  net receipt  in one period and the other of a  net produce  in another period it is no wonder that there is a difference between the two accounts" This is acknowledging that the Records of the Exchequer received all the produce as estimated except that difference and such sort of evidence we have for making up of these accounts nevertheless the account from the Customhouse certifies that the arrears standing out at Midsummer was  l  it must be observed that the usual arrears standing out in every year during the reign of King George the First as likewise in the first year of his late Majesty was about  l  was this very extraordinary arrear left in the hands of the receiver or receivers to create a deficiency of the duties for years does it not now appear upon the whole of this account of the produce of the Customs that it is founded on estimated and fictitious valuations to answer the present purpose  There was a remarkable difference between the Treasuryaccount of the net receipt and the Commissioners of the Excise account of the  net produce to reconcile them the same explanation as has already been mentioned as to the Customs says "The account of the net produce of the hereditary and temporary Excise according to the commissioners accounts given into Parliament is    l  the Exchequer receipt  of that revenue amounted to  l  the difference  l  after the hereditary and temporary Excise is paid into the Exchequer it is chargeable with the payment of    l  per annum  to the SouthSea Company for subscription into their capital of the lottery which for years is  l  the difference  l  therefore had the King charged himself with  the produce  instead of the receipt of this revenue the difference would have been only  l  in the years"  The civillist Lottery of which was for  l  a year and to be paid out of the Excise was for years to pay the interest and principal of  l  There was subscribed of it into the SouthSea Company  l  at    l  per Cent  which is    l  per annum  which multiplied by years would no ways answer what    l  was desired to do the remaining annual sum of  l  which ought to have gone to the sinking fund to pay off that principal sum subscribed was taken from it under the iniquitous pretence of its having emerged into the civillist founded only and no otherwise authorized but by an opinion obtained from his Majesty's learned Council on a false state of the Case It now appears that the said annual sum of  l  has not been accounted for as a part of the civillist revenue for the years deficiency of duties and that amounts to  l  where has this emerged again  The Commissioners of the Excise in all their former accounts delivered to Parliament in accounting for the produce of the civillist revenue have constantly deducted the sum of  l  a year for that civillist lottery from the gross produce and the remainder is the net produce of the civillist revenue and they are still obliged by the law to pay annually into the Exchequer that sum of  l  they have nothing to do with the disposition of it afterwards and  therefore cannot lawfully alter their method of accounting for it from a future disposition of it  The Commissioners by their account to the Treasury of November declare that the monies which have been applied by the Cashier to the uses of his Majesty's civil government for the year was  l  but in their account of the second of January was only  l  though the remaining sum of  l  was first charged by them as paid to Lord Orford for his pension and this is the only sum that appears to have been paid him out of the produce of the several Offices of the Revenue and is this all that has been paid him but this is alone sufficient to prove that this Excise account to Parliament cannot be right and administers sufficient cause of suspicion as to other articles I shall now state this Excise account in another manner as one short convincing proposition  This account makes the net produce to be  l  to which add only the  l  paid the Prince of Wales the real net produce is  l  the account of the Exchequer  is  l  to which add paid by the Cashier for his Majesty's warrants the sum of  l  makes the whole but  l  which being deducted from the net produce there remains  l  of which there was standing out in arrears at Midsummer the sum of  l  and therefore there could be in that time only the sum of  l  that could be applied for the civillist lottery of for seven years  This account says the arrears standing out on Midsummer the very day they were due on was  l  on Midsummerday they were but  l  which is now so much more than usual that it may be suspected to have been left in the hands of the receivers to create a greater deficiency in the duties and revenue The date of this account is the Second of January and they there acknowledge that the sum of  l  had been paid in for those arrears standing out at Midsummer  The account delivered from the PostOffice for the produce of the seven years on which I  must first make a small observation on the correctness of the Treasury accounts that for the seven years deficiency charges the receipt of the PostOffice for to be  l  this new account for years but  l  This is the most delicate of all accounts that were delivered into Parliament The Commissioners have prudently avoided the signing of it having no doubt heard what happened to others in when the account of the produce of the civillist revenue was called for by Parliament and their receiving a letter from the Treasury to make them up in another manner to impose on the Parliament and the letter was produced for their own justification they therefore now left it to the accomptant to make up something of an account that might pass for the present it is so slovenly done that they have not cast up the total of any of the several heads of deductions nor the account of the net produce for the seven years  The first most extraordinary article I shall take notice of is the charges of the management which as it stands here for these seven years is  noless than  l  that it is greatly increased during this period is certain but it is impossible that it should come to so enormous a sum and there must be something not right in this article which may be thus stated to cover something else for the charges of management for the year was but  l  During the old system we were not permitted to ease the nation of the heavy weight of unnecessary charges in the collection of the revenues but they were increased for the sake of a corrupt influence over the electors and elected and the nation is greatly deceived in thinking that the crown pays for the charges of collecting the civillist revenues which is a rentcharge and therefore the collection of it is a burden on the people the ministers therefore have not been desirous of easing the nation of any part of so unnecessary a burden but our exhausted state may now require it  This account from the PostOffice makes the net produce for the seven years including the payments of his Majesty's Warrants and  Grants to be  l  the Treasury account of the deficiencies of those duties for those seven years acknowledges the receipt in every year on the very Midsummerday they were due on to amount to  l  which leaves an arrear on the seven years but of  l  yet this PostOffice account charges the arrears standing out on Midsummerday to be  l  is not this very surprising The account is dated the th of January and says that there has been paid of those arrears before that date the sum of  l  I have all these arrears been artfully kept back for the sake of the deficiencies of the duties  This discovery now leads us to examine the article of the PostOffice for in this new years account which is the year after the pretended deficiencies it charged the net receipt of the PostOffice in every year to be but  l  for that year yet it now appears there was paid in between Midsummer and Midsummer before the th of January the sum of l besides what was paid in of the remaining arrears of    l  and all that has been paid in for the produce of the year May we not therefore suspect that this arrear of the PostOffice for  l  the arrear of the Excise for  l  and the arrear of the Custom for  l  amounting to  l  has not been accounted for since  Some of the first hours at the very beginning of the last reign passed in a due consideration of certain money affairs to that immediately succeeded the bidding for the administration which rose from  l  in the late reign to  l  a year and in the same manner the bargain was struck for it it was opened so to the Parliament and a bill was ordered in for that purpose but then a bidding  after Game  was play'd it was observed that the revenue in the preceeding reign was not all paid on the day that they were due but were in a few months afterwards and that therefore a net receipt within every year was penuriously calculated to be more advantageous This occasioned the bringing into the bill that extraordinary clause which could not be then  taken notice of but was sufficiently the next year when the merit of the aftergame was to be claimed it was thought the revenue had produced for that year but  l  the intrigue of the closet obliged the minister to make good that deficiency and he demanded it as such of the Parliament and when that was too much exposed for his own friends to vote it as a deficiency he was still necessitated to take it as an arrear No one could ever think that exposed and intriguing precedent would ever have been imposed again on the people  We were engaged on the Continent in the war for the Austrian succession our part was directed and carried on on the most absurd selfcontradictory principles We might have had a peace by the treaty at Hanau and the favourite measure  from natal predilection  would have been satisfied for that time by secularizations It was approved of by his Majesty and by his Minister with him who sent it over to the Regency to be approved of here four of them though there were nineteen Lord Justices  without communicating it to the rest of them clandestinely took it upon themselves to refuse it It would have destroy'd their system for their own administration They kept the secret they added to the flame of the nation against the minister who was for peace as being the only minister that was for carrying on the war they succeeded and his Majesty was forced at the end of the year to part with the minister that was for that peace and we were then necessitated to go on with the war to give hopes of obtaining at last the  Favourite Measure  which they had prevented being obtained by another  flattering themselves that events would arise to put him out of humour with his favourite measure  which they happily obtain'd for that time by carrying it on till they could raise no more money and left the hopes to remain to the next broils that could be made or found on the Continent in the mean time recover our finances reduce the interest of the funds from four to three  per cent  without giving the poor people any ease from it by taking off their taxes for they were reserved to be applied to  such proper uses In the beginning of the year the minister had been guilty of a most grievous provoking offence did not all these hardships then require  douceurs  On the eighth of December the demand was made for the deficiencies of the duties and revenues of the civillist for  l  I will not touch upon votes of credit subsidies payments of Foreign troops nor on the true motives or causes of our desperate bloody war nor on the third partition treaty for the dividing of the Prussian Bearskin for they may be thought foreign to my Occasional Observations  I sincerely believe that the only motive for calling for an account of the clear produce of the years was to do honour to his late Majesty by undeceiving the people as to the enormity of his civillist revenue and with no view to do honour to his administrations by shewing with how little they had done so much nor that it could then be conceived that a doubletitled  account would have been given of it and of the unavoidable consequences that must arise from it The experienced Old Systemites with the hopes of a successful aftergame highly blame the measure of accepting the  l  a year certain and thereby the giving up the benefit of the late civillist act in not accounting for any years surplus and the benefit of accounting for fictitious deficiencies some of the lower herd of murmurers who judge of the Rectitude of measures by names or epithets to names have cast an eye only on the sum total of  l  as the produce of years in every year and then dividing that by they find by certain unerring occular demonstration that his present Majesty has obtained a greater civillist revenue than his late Majesty had From all that has been urged in these Observations it must now appear that it is absolutely necessary for the true information of the nation and to do justice to his present Majesty that the account of the clear produce of the civillist revenues from Midsummer to Midsummer last as called for by  the Parliament be truly and faithfully laid before them  The arts the ridiculous insinuations the many insulting clamours to support and revive the expiring Old System must be despised by every honest man who rejoices in seeing the true spirit of our constitution once more restored which had been so long despaired of not only by the most solemn words and assurances from the Th  e but by publick acts the taking of  l  a year certain for the civillist revenueAll our judges are confirmed to us not one turned out as was at the beginning of the late reign to give another interpretation to the act of settlement than was before understood to be the true sense and meaning of it by putting one out and afterwards restoring him upon the first vacancy to establish that prerogative in the Crown and by giving freedom to every placeman to vote for his own representative in ParliamentIn this situation of my King and Country having some knowledge of these revenues I thought it might be of service to the  publick to make these Observations and give this Sketch of the Conduct of our Money affairs under the Old System wishing some abler pen would do the same as to our Continent measures And that All the People may be truly sensible and fully convinced of that great blessing of Providence to them in giving them a KING BORN AND EDUCATED A BRITON  THE END
