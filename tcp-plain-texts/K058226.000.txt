Rural  SCENE  CUPID  discovered asleep on a flowery bank  Enter  AMARANTHUS  HOW anxious are the creeping hours till fair Tulippa's mine yet let me not complain since her kind tho' delicate reception of my vows raises me above a monarch's fortuneMy artless muse having tacked together some feeble rhimes expressive of my heart I'  hang them on this friendly bough    Hangs up a paper    where they may speak more plainly to her sight than my diffident unpractic'd tongue can to her ear  SONG  To those who never tasted love  How simple seem our pains  Yet e'en Philosophy may prove  The force of Cupid's chains  I hug their weight and smile to think  The stubborn stoic's heart  May soon like mine sweet poison drink  From Cupid's golden dart  Exit  CUPID  advances  Not even slumber's leaden mace can remove from my distracted mind the severe treatment of scornful cruel Psycheshall I who dispense love or hate upon the points of leaden or golden darts be made her sport Shall rural nymphs and swains enjoy a happiness unknown to Cupid It must not beno I'll exert myself to work confusion amongst them  SONG  My pow'r shall produce such a jumble  Of love misapplied and absurd  The aged and youthful shall grumble  While jealousy reigns in each word  Threescore quite enamour'd of twenty  For beauty shall make a sad moan  While the young having quarrels in plenty  Their likings their wishes disown  Thus mischief shall soften our sorrow  By others my pangs I'll relieve  We all may be happy tomorrow  Nor have more occasion to grieve  This paper opportunely I have found  With this at first resentment shall be crown'd  To breed contention 'twixt this pair  And fill their hearts with mutual care  Vanish hence Tulippa's name    Strikes the paper  Let Verna's take its placewhom fame  Pronounces fairest of the plain  Hence shall the Nymph suspect her swain  And treat his tend'rest vows with rough disdain  Exit  Enter  TULIPPA  How pleasingly those sprayperch'd warblers chaunt throughout the grove how sweetly rising flowrets scent the vernal Air these few selected with a careful hand and pearl'd with honey'd dew shall adorn the faithful bosom of my AmaranthusWhere can he be wand'ring Time stands still when he is absent but imps his wings with double speed when the dear object of my doating eyes is near  SONG  Gentle child of smiling spring  Blooming fragrant nosegay haste  Let affection lend a wing  Bearing to my lover's breast  There a soft reception find  From his gentle gen'rous mind  Sees the paper  What's hereone of love's packetsThe explanation of some timorous swain or bashful maid who fearing speech has given thought to paperHa the character of Amaranthus quick let my eager sight devour the sweet contents    Takes down the paper and reads    What do I read Love's warmest effusion poured forth to VernaThe milky softness leaves my breast and gall of jealousy flows inAh foolish eyes indulge not idle tearsAh simple heart thy fruitless throbbing ceaseit will not be how nature's beauties wither in my sight false false Amaranthus  But see he comes perhaps to meet with Vernahis new mistressIf solong as I can bear behind this arbour I'll see the painful interview    Retires  Reenter  AMARANTHUS  To search so long and not to find her  TULIPPA  Oh Sir your new fangled passion's impatient  AMARANTHUS  The paper gone Sure it has reach'd the beauteous hand I wish  TULIPPA  Perhaps not  AMARANTHUS  Having convey'd this faint but honest picture of my heart  TULIPPA  And a pretty one it is truly  AMARANTHUS  I shall henceforth be able to address her with more confidence  TULIPPA  Confidence enough no doubtI must indulge my swelling spleen and show myselfSo thoughtful swain  AMARANTHUS  Ha my Tulippa here  TULIPPA  Your Tulippa  AMARANTHUS  Yes my Tulippa that is to beI hope  TULIPPA  Flattering hope like flattering swains carries much deceit with it  AMARANTHUS  What agitates my lovely fair Why swim her eyes with tears Why flies the bloom from off those cheeks where dimpled beauty always fits  TULIPPA  Because my heart so much detests falsehood that even my features must speak truth  AMARANTHUS  You speak in riddles and cloud me with astonishment  TULIPPA  Haste from these honest plains to cities haste where doublefac'd hypocrisy is found in every class where virtue and constancy are laugh'd out of countenance and love is nothing but a name  AMARANTHUS  These plains indeed I'll fly if my Tulippa proves unkind but why should I be exil'd from that rural simplicity and all my soul admires  TULIPPA  False swain think on the bitter fruit I plucked from yonder bough and repeat that question if you can  AMARANTHUS  Fruit if the produce of my poor brain deserves that name I hope tho' it cannot boast the richness of genius it may claim the flavour of sincerity  TULIPPA  SincerityVerna  AMARANTHUS  What of herVernaI know she is esteemed fair but  TULIPPA  I know thee false without a butso traitor farewel forever  SONG  Forever farewell  Love hears its own knell  Your falshood has toll'd it aloud  Yet why should I grieve  At what may relieve  To be free from a traitor I'm proud  Exit  AMARANTHUS  Falsehood Traitor Verna What a game of confusion what cross purposesThat falsehood which I suppose has waver'd her own heart she would artfully charge upon mine  SONG  That women will change I've been told  But never experienc'd before  What glitters is not always gold  I've lov'd but I'll do so no more  Tulippa has met with some swain  Of carriage more pleasing than me  To lose her must furnish some pain  Yet perhaps 'tis as well I am free  Enter  HYEMA  A fine young fellow I protestand wonderfully good they sayHow active and firm he treadsSuch a husband would be charmingly comfortable to a person of my years and circumstancesBut I suppose he's for some flirting young minxWho knows all youth are not fools and properly talk'd to he may complyI'll try however for as they say  "a faint heart never won a fair lady"  so a bashful face can never gain a brisk husbandFair smile the spring upon you master Amaranthus  AMARANTHUS  Good morrow mother  HYEMA  Mother Nay young swain tho' daylight and I have been long acquainted not long enough for that neither but you are a handsome sensible young man and should have all imaginable libertyI protest I speak as I thinkI need not tell you that Autumn is a much richer and kindlier season than spring  AMARANTHUS  It may be so  HYEMA  May be it so I have pass'd the flirting and am just entering into the sober sensible time of lifeDo you never think of matrimony master Amaranthus  AMARANTHUS  Truly I have thought of it till I began to fear entering upon so dangerous a connection  HYEMA  Very true it is a dangerous state indeed but not with a prudent partnerLackaday you seem mighty uneasya good wife would certainly comfort youmethinks you and I would make a very happy couple  AMARANTHUS  How match with you  HYEMA  Me why not shepherdYou'll be safe from any dishonour to your family my virtue will guard against thatThen I'll be as loving and constant as a turtle dove  AMARANTHUS  Ay stick like a blister no doubt  HYEMA  Then I'll be as merry as a Jay and make life one entire holidayDifference of a few years is an idle a very idle distinction  AMARANTHUS  How this beldam increases my perplexity  SONG  HYEMA  You might marry a girl in the bloom of her youth  Not more frolic and frisky than I  And then for my person I think it forsooth  Not unworthy a young shepherd's eye  Allow me the hearing to tell a plain truth  Tho' not quite so young I have got a colt's tooth  Those who boast of the roses which bloom in each cheek  And skin often liken'd to snow  In virtue and housewifery oft are to seek  A terrible matter you know  Then object not to years you may trust me insooth  No female e'er dies without a colt's tooth  AMARANTHUS  Sure nothing can be more painful especially in my state of mind than a forward fulsome amorous old woman  HYEMA  Well young swain and what say you Good offers don't come often when they do to refuse them is standing in one's own lightSir Gregory Greybeard examiner and licencer of marriages for this district sits today  so we may be settled for lifeand I love to follow that excellent maxim  "strike while the Iron is hot"  AMARANTHUS  Well Well give me half an hour to think and you shall have my determination  SONG  Revenge and despair may inspire my heart  With feelings unknown till this hour  Since beauty and youth have play'd the false part  Kind age may with reason have pow'r  Exit  HYEMA  So far so goodWell I vow he's a sweet creatureay and sensible tooWhen I have him all to myself the gilflirts of the plain will so envy meBut I must stick close fools only are mealymouth'd  Exit  Enter  NINNY  follow'd by  CULINA  NINNY  I will sing for all you and all day too if I like  SONG  burlesque  When all the antic fire was dead  And all the Romish virtue fled  Poor freedom lost her feet  The goatish mantle spread a light  Which damn'd fair Virtue's fading night  The muses lost a sheet  CULINA  Ay ay you make a noise like a false fellow as you are to stop my mouth but if you call it singing screechowls shall turn teachers of music and ravens vocal performers  NINNY  My bad singing is better than your loud scolding  CULINA  Have I not reason  NINNY  Nimble tongues find ready excuse for wagging  CULINA  And fickle hearts prove false without any excuse at alldid not you promise to marry me varlet  NINNY  What then Greater folks than I make promises they never mean to keepMoreover than that I lov'd you then but I don't now  CULINA  You don't And why not scapegrace  NINNY  Why because my mind's chang'd  CULINA  Mighty well fashionable Sir I suppose since you have got that mon'strous fine tail to your crow'snest hair your large tossel'd cane and that carving knife to apologize for a sword at your side you are setting up for some flauntier body than a plain honest industrious cookmaid  NINNY  You have hit it  CULINA  I havethen sirrah henceforth I banish you the kitchenNever shall your hungry jaws be liquor'd with sops i'th' pan  NINNY  If you sop yourself there Mrs Culina I shan't burn my fingers to take you out  CULINA  Provoking knave I have much ado to keep my hands off your ugly face  NINNY  Ugly face thank you for that you'd give all the shoes in your shop to be half so handsome then as to fistycuffs I'm as pretty a bit of flesh as in all Arcadia  so if I should draw a tooth or paint an eye blame yourself  CULINA  Our master Sir Gregory shall know what a knave you areIf I had believ'd all you said I might have lost all my vartue but I'll put a spoke in your wheeland since you won't have me you shall have nobody else  NINNY  Why the woman chatters worse than ten couple of magpies in pairing time or two score gossips half seas over at a christeningAre you any thing the worse of my wear  CULINA  Sirrah sirrah I'd have you to know I can get a better husband than ever stood on your shanks for holding up a finger but to be slighted by such a pitiful sapskull'd fellowSir Gregory Sir Gregory sirrah shall bring you to your marrowbones    Exit  NINNY  I'm glad she's goneIf I had not spoke a little stoutly of tooth drawing she would have claw'd meI'm not the first brave fellow who has saved broken bones by big wordsBohand arms a kimbo have often pass'd for courageWhen she talked of the drippingpan the basting ladle could not be far offOh here comes Mrs Tulippa the very sight of her has turn'd my heart upside down like a Shrovetide pancake and made it jump for all the world like a new  caught squirrel in a bellcageShall I speak to her or do the business with oglingboth's best I believeut I' l listen to find what humour she is in  Enter  TULIPPA  SONG  TULIPPA  To every passing gale I'll tell  To ev'ry murm'ring stream relate  The fickle swain I lov'd so well  Has left me for another mate  Not so when doves in friendship pair  Do they a tender trust deceive  Of love they grant a mutual share  And only for each other live  NINNY  A fine day fair mistress  TULIPPA  Agreeable enough to those who can enjoy it  NINNY  But I believe there's going to be a change for last night the man in the moon had got his beard onOld Mother Grazy complained of the rheumatice our cat washed her face over the left ear and I have a corn that shoots like any thing  TULIPPA  Heigho  NINNY  Nay you need not be sorry for the cornI have a worser pain than that  TULIPPA  It may be so  NINNY  Ay a pain in the heart  TULIPPA  If so indeed I pity you  NINNY  Then you know what makes it  TULIPPA  Not I indeed  NINNY  But you can guess  TULIPPA  No truly  NINNY  Was youcan't you see something in in my eyeswas you ever in love Mrs Tulippa  TULIPPA  Why do you ask  NINNY  Because because I want to know what it feels like  TULIPPA  That you had better never know  NINNY  Ay but what if I know against my will I dream'd such a dream last night about bridecake drawn through a gold ring throwing the stocking whip sullabbubs sweethearts and pincushions that I thinks as how I am in love with you  TULIPPA  Have you any other reason to think so  NINNY  Oh yes for my eyes have glisten'd ever fince I saw you like dry whitings in a dark night and when you turn'd the corner just now my heart began to dance a hornpipe without music  TULIPPA  Yonder I see Amaranthus comingList'ning to and giving this simpleton encouragement will at least shew how light he is in my esteem and if he has any spirit mortify him  NINNY  May I hope  Enter  AMARANTHUS  Aside    TULIPPA  Did you ever make love to any body before  AMARANTHUS  What this wretch her gallant  NINNY  Oh yes to onebut lackaday she is no more to be compar'd to you than a cowslip to a cabbage or a pancake to a plumbpudding  TULIPPA  If I was sure you did not flatter  AMARANTHUS  This is too much to bear  NINNY  Flatter no no I'm not scholar enough for that  TULIPPA  Then here's my hand  NINNY  You have made my heart as light as a merry duckling in a fishpond  TULIPPA  Oh Mr Amaranthus you are luckily come to witness our bargain  AMARANTHUS  Mrs Tulippa any bargain you think proper to make I shall readily agree to  TULIPPA  No doubtyou are a most condescending creature  NINNY  Very goodnatured and descending indeed Mr Amaranthus  AMARANTHUS  I find no great pleasure in the praise of a fool  TULIPPA  Oh sweet Sir an honest fool is much better than a sensible knave  NINNY  If so be I am a fool my family is very old and numerous with many near relations among people of fashion  AMARANTHUS  I hope when this charming match takes place you'll now and then lend that gingling cap to your lady it will add much to her charms  TULIPPA  Wonderfully smart  NINNY  She's handsome enough withoutbut now you talk of that master Amaranthus if every fool was to wear such a cap would not it cause rare trade for bellmakersI can't help laughing to think how many great folks who seldom say more than aye or no would then make a very considerable noiseHow many pulpits would then ring almost as loud as the church steeple and how many physicians would toll the knell of those patients they had kill'd  Enter  HYEMA  HYEMA  So so I have overtaken you at last its almost Sir Gregory's sitting time and I would not miss the day for any thing because it would delay us a whole month  AMARANTHUS  Well I am ready to attend you there I have now no further occasion for liberty marriage and the grave are equally indifferent  HYEMA  The grave good lack I would not think of such a place for ever so muchI'll soon put better thoughts in your head young swain  TULIPPA  And is that the Lady of your choice  AMARANTHUS  Prudent age is better than deceitful youth  NINNY  Master Amaranthus shall I lend you my cap or get a new one made for you  QUARTETTO  AMA  I care not how mad or how foolish I seem  Life henceforth to me shall be only a dream  TUL  With resentment to urge let me rush on my fate  A false one I found him but found it too late  HY  I'll make a fond wife  NIN  I'll love you for life  ALL  Then away to Sir Greg's
