 THE PANTHEONITES A DRAMATIC ENTERTAINMENT  Price One Shilling  THE PANTHEONITES A DRAMATIC ENTERTAINMENT AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN THE HAYMARKET  LONDON Printed for J BELL near ExeterChange in the Strand and C ETHERINGTON at York MDCCLXXIII  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE COUNTESS of HERTFORD  MADAM  AS I flatter myself the public will agree in my opinion that a burlesque of affected gentility can be no where better addressed than to a Lady whose elegant and liberal ideas of life ornament even Nobility I have ventured this intrusion which as it proceeds from a profound respect for your Ladyship's very distinguished character will I hope be considered in a favourable light  I am with all possible deference MADAM  Your Ladyship's Most obedient and very Devoted servant THE AUTHOR  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Author of this  Dramatic scrap  having from a fatal and irreparable event in his family laboured under a gloom of mind exceedingly disadvantageous to  Comic  ideas has reason to fear it wants much of that spirit which a happier state of imagination would have produced but having promised a piece of this kind to Mr  As Mr FOOTE kindly conferred an unexpected favour on Mr WESTON which rendered a new piece unnecessary the author is happy in transferring it to Mr JEWELL as a very valuable member of society  WESTON as a performer of singular merit he encountred a task rather irksome and to get the subject out of his way pursued it with uncommon rapidity however from the favourable opinion of some judicious friends hopes it will not be deemed unworthy existence on the stage or in the closet  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Sir FRANCIS FAIRLOVE  Â   DAN DRUGGER  Mr WESTON  FARMER TILWELL  Mr BANNISTER  TIM TILWELL  Mr FEARON  SKINFLINT  Mr GENTLEMAN  FRIZEAU  Mr JACOBS  DICKEY DRUGGER  Miss FRANCIS  SERVANT  Mr FRANCIS  Mrs DEBORAH DRUGGER  Mrs WILLIAMS  ANNA  Miss PLATT  LISINI  Miss CRAVEN  SCENE LONDON  THE PANTHEONITES  ACT THE FIRST  SCENE I  Enter  TILWELL  and  SKINFLINT  meeting    SKINFLINT  _HA honest farmer well met  TILWELL  Honest farmer Hey day what are all you London folks flatterers Tho' by the bye I believe I am as honest as most of my neighbours Tom Tilwell can lay his hand upon his heart and say he never belied providence nor wished a rise of provisions in his life  SKINFLINT  Hoity toity if many farmers were of this way of thinking we cornfactors and salesmen should be soon as thin as Pharoah's lean kinea parcel of poor devils indeed the finest scheme in the world except clipping and coining would be totally ruined No no Heaven send the landlords to raise their rents and the farmers to keep pace with themAh you don't know the pleasure and profit we enjoy  TILWELL  Pleasure what in starving your fellow creatures  SKINFLINT  Starvingno no mercy forbid not so bad as that only lock their jaws a little  TILWELL  You don't by appearance master Skinflint seem as if your jaws were much locked  SKINFLINT  Me why you would not put me on a footing with ragged weavers in Spittlefields or slipshod taylors in Clement DanesYou don't see into the bottom of thingsWe are friends to government as well as ourselves The English master Tilwell Londoners particularly are with full bellies insolent grumbling politicians they pretend to think for themselvesNow  weaken the beer when you raise the price clip short their beef and pudding keep provisions high and wages lowyou have 'em as tame as so many pet pigeons  TILWELL  At this rate your business is of great use  SKINFLINT  The greatest importance I assure youWe are on the Changealley plan exactly as they have at all times letters ready from Dantzig Hamburgh the Hague or an express from India over land to influence stock so we have accounts from every shire in England to keep up the markets  TILWELL  What then you have correspondents in all parts of the kingdom  SKINFLINT  Not one on that accountWe don't care how things really are we can make them as we pleaseWhy I have burned the uplands with sunshine and drowned the lowlands with rain a thousand times I was the means of lifting up the peck loaf twopence last week and have another petition from the bakers to the court of aldermen in my pocket it's penned in such a lamentable stile that I don't doubt with one or two more working up to a shilling  TILWELL  What when there's a fine crop fine weather for harvest and new corn coming in  SKINFLINT  No matter for thatDid not you see a paragraph of mine in the papers last week that all the old was gone Yet would you think it now for all I take so much pains and make it so fine a time for gentlemen of the crust I was obliged to arrest one of the fraternity yesterday for a hundred and fifty  TILWELL  He must be a bad manager indeed  SKINFLINT  Apes qualityas most of our tradespeople do nowadayskeeps a countryhouse a phaeton and for ought I know a mistress But I don't so much blame him for this if he had any brains why the blockhead in five years trade for himself never had sense enough to make a loaf two or three ounces short and is so plaguy conscientious as not to use any allum because its unwholesomeTime for me to look sharp master Tilwell  TILWELL  But after all friend Skinflint though I am a farmer and may gain by it I think it hard  that there should be plenty and scarcity at the same time  SKINFLINT  Politic politicIf all the fish that's caught was brought to market and all the meat that's killed sold both would soon be a drug There is one instance among manyMat Marrowbone of Honeylane market as pretty a fellow as ever whetted a knife will frequently rather than take a halfpenny a pound under the fixed price on Saturday night tip ten guineas worth into the Thames on Sunday morning He has show'd me his Thames register and a sweet pretty collection of drowned joints there is However I advised him for the future to bury all because you know in the water it may feed and increase the stock of fish which might hurt the flesh trade Mat took the hintah he's a sensible spirited fellow as ever sold thirteen ounces for a pound and can afford to live genteelly  TILWELL  Well notwithstanding what you say I am for peace and plenty You shall hear my thoughts on that subject in a song taught me by our vicar as hearty an old blade as ever wore black or used a tobaccostopper  SONG  Let me ne'er know the man  With pipe and full can  Whose prayers and study will cease  That all the good things  Which providence brings  May crown us with plenty and peace  Of this let our songs never cease  Of peace and of plenty of plenty and peace  Let a cup of strong beer  Each free Briton cheer  With plenty of pudding and beef  To France we'll resign  Soup meagre and wine  And at home find out perfect relief  Of this let our songs never cease  Of peace and of plenty of plenty and peace  When a kind season sends  For the best of all ends  To mankind a plentiful store  May they who for gain  Would render it vain  Ne'er taste its indulgences more  Of this let our songs never cease  Of peace and of plenty of plenty and peace  SKINFLINT  I like the tune and your singing master Tilwell  but the words are horribly against trade I would not have them sung in one of our committees for ten quarters of wheat  TILWELL  Committees  SKINFLINT  Yes we have seven every week the forestalling one meets Sunday afternoon at Islington to tax Monday's market at Smithfield on Monday the staffoflife committee meet in Mark Lane to settle how much a quarter on Tuesday the coal committee to pray for strong easterly winds three months together the beginning of winter Wednesday the provender committee to settle hay straw and oats Thursday the Billingsgate committee to price fish Friday the monopolizing committee to engross hops and on Saturday the brewing committee to make as soon as possible beer four pence a pot  TILWELL  Well some of us are bad enough in the country but here I find you famish one another by rule  SKINFLINT  Fair game master Tilwell the public is very fair game But you don't like the subject I see till you think better of it we'll change itI had almost forgot to wish you joy  TILWELL  Joy of what  SKINFLINT  Your soninlaw Dan Drugger's good fortune  TILWELL  What has he got a good bargain of tobacco  SKINFLINT  So I find their hurry and joy have made them forget youThe lottery ticket you gave your youngest daughter Anna is come up a blankthat to Deborah your eldest twenty thousand pounds  TILWELL  Twenty thousand pounds  SKINFLINT  Certainly the tobacco trade was given up in three days a house was taken near GrosvenorSquare in three more a French valet a French cook an Italian waiting woman and a long c have been engaged within the last week  TILWELL  You astonish me I must go immediately to this new shop of politenessFortune seldom grants her favours right else poor Anna who deserves ten times as much as Deb would have had the prize  SKINFLINT  Well I promised to call at the Exchequer to day about itfor it must be sold immediatelyand I'll meet you at Dan's in less than two hours  Exit  TILWELL  A French cook a French valet and an Italian waiting womanWhy good luck has turned the brains of the ideots if they ever had any upside downBut this methodical minister of famine what must I think of him that no monster in human shape can exceed that man who labours to increase the misery and to prey on the vitals of the poor  Going  Enter  TIM TILWELL  TIM  Hollo Uncle  TILWELL  What have you ventured without a guide  Did not I bid you take the ostler with you  TIM  What signifies that you think I can do nothing by myselfI maunt be in leadingstrings all my lifeI found the way well enough and called at our butter merchant's who gave me two large glasses of such rare stuff  TILWELL  As seem to have rais'd your spirits well I am glad you made no blunder  TIM  Blunder No no I cannot help laughing to think of the good fortune I have had but you'll tell nobody

a glass of wine I could not for shame refuse her so she told me she was a knight and baronet's daughter that she would take me to her papa's house in something square but was afraid till she knew how the land lay  Why she told me such things as would make one's hair stand an end about one man flying ten feet high on a rope another jumping with a ladder like any thing and another O la riding full speed with his head on a pint pot and other most wonderful conjurations  TILWELL  So you are quite sure of her  TIM  Sure as if we had been at church together Sure indeed Why she gave me her hand and two hearty smacks upon it  SONG  This song omitted in representation  When I this fine lady shall wed  Like a squire then I'll hold up my head  With a sword at my side  I'll strut by my bride  I'll frisk it and frolic and rant it about  'Till thro' this great town I have made a great rout  TILWELL  So so the butter merchant's good stuff with the lady's kindness and wine have made you as merry as a country feast at ChristmasPray how did you part at last  TIM  Why she could not stay but appointed me to  meet her tomorrow precisely twelve o'clock at the cap and bells in Knavesacre  TILWELL  A most excellent direction pray nephew what's a clock now  TIM  A clock whyoh la I've lost my fine eight guinea watch  TILWELL  Have you so Oh the lady has only borrow'd it there are a great many such knight's daughters about this town perhaps she has made love to your purse too  TIM  Adswooks and so she has  TILWELL  So you had a hearty smack for one and a shake by the hand for the other  TIM  Four golden guineas and a queen Ann's crown piece given me by aunt Tibby I shall never be able to face home again  TILWELL  Never fear I'll make all up if you behave well while we are in town but be sure to mind  TIM  Mind I warrant mefour guineasbut now I think on't three of them were light onesthat's some comfort however  TILWELL  Ha ha ha You won't let care hang long on your mind Come we'll

never admits a cloud to hang on it  ANNA  I am tolerably at ease Sir Francis and strive to keep myself so there is no occasion to pursue care it too often falls in our way unsought  SIR FRANCIS  Perfectly rightbut you are philosophical on every occasion the calmness or rather pleasure with which you heard your sister's good fortune is a peculiar instance  ANNA  As I had formed  o expectations the disappointment of my chance was easily borne  SIR FRANCIS  Not so easily Madam though you have given me but very distant expectation of being made happy by your fair hand yet I should be much more unsatisfied if hope was turned up a positive blank  ANNA  Sir Francis the world calls you a man of honour and I believe you one believe your professions are sincere however beyond what I can merit but Sir that father who brought me up with the utmost tenderness claims a share in the disposal especially as I'm sure he'll never do it against my inclinations  SIR FRANCIS  Far be it from me to infringe upon his just and natural authority had I your leave his opinion should be soon consulted  ANNA  I have often told you Sir the difference of birth and fortune  SIR FRANCIS  Virtue and good sense are far above them  ANNA  I am not like my sister fond of the splendor of life  SIR FRANCIS  Therefore the more wor  y to enjoy it Splendor is but a rattle to weak minds its dignity rises from due application  ANNA  A rattle I think indeed for the very notion of it seems to have rattled our family out of their senses but as my father is every day expected in town I hope his prudence will set them to rights a little  SIR FRANCIS  Your father Madam so soon expected May I be indulged with liberty to ask his opinion of the proposals I have made for you to share my fortune and my heart  ANNA
