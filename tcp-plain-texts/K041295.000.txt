 OF THE PATAGONIANS  FORMED from the relation of Father FALKENER a Jesuit who had resided among them thirty eight Years And from the different Voyagers who had met with this tall race  PRINTED BY THE FRIENDSHIP OF GEORGE ALLAN ESQ AT HIS PRIVATE PRESS AT DARLINGTON  MDCCLXXXVIII  IN the Year happening to fall into company in which the subject of the  Patagonians  was mentioned several opinions arose some savoring of scepticism others gave full credit to the accounts lately published By accident I heard of Father  Falkener  who had been expelled the  Spanish  Dominions in  America  and sent to  Europe  with the rest of his Brethren He was at that time at  Spetchley  near  Worcester  I immediately procured recommendation to the worthy owner  Robert Berkely  Esq  from whom I met with every politeness I then commenced with him a friendship which ever since has given me singular pleasure I found Father  Falkener  to be a man of about seventy Years of age active in mind and body  Brusque  in his manners having never shaken off those he had acquired in his thirty eight Years residence among the Savages He very freely communicated to me every thing he knew respecting those People He informed me also that he was born at  Manchester  that about the Year he was a Surgeon in the  Assiento  Ship and in that Year became at  Buenos Ayres  a convert to Popery and in due time of the society of  Jesuits  and was sent on the mission of  Paraquay  This little piece would never have seen the light but for the friendship of Mr ALLAN and let the few to whom this may give pleasure unite in thanks to that liberal Gentleman with  his obliged and affect humble Servant  THOMAS PENNANT  Downing  March  st  TO THE HONORABLE DAINES BARRINGTON  DEAR SIR  I NOW execute the promise I made in Town some time ago of communicating to you the result of my visit to Mr  Falkener  an antient Jesuit who had passed thirty eight Years of his life in the Southern part of South  America  between the River  la Plata  and the streights of  Magellan  Let me endeavour to prejudice you in favor of my new Friend by assuring you that by his long intercourse with the Inhabitants of  Patagonia  he seems to have lost all  European  guile and to have acquired all the simplicity and honest impetuosity of the people he has been so long conversant with I venture to give you only as much of his narrative as he could vouch for the authenticity of which consists of such as he was eye witness to and such as will I believe establish past contradiction the veracity of our late Circumnavigators and give new lights into the manners of this singular race of Men It will not I flatter myself be deemed impertinent to lay before you a Chronological Mention of the several evidences that will tend to prove the existence of a People of a supernatural height inhabiting the Southern Tract You will find that the majority of Voyagers who have touched on that Coast have seen them and made reports of their size that will very well keep in countenance the verbal account given by Mr  Byron  and the printed by Mr  Clarke  you will observe that if the old Voyagers did exaggerate it was thro' the novelty and amazement at so singular a sight but the latter forewarn'd by the preceding accounts seem to have made their remarks with coolness and confirmed them by the experiment of measurement  A D The first who saw these people was the great  Magellan  one of them just made his appearance on the banks of the River  la Plata  and then made his retreat but during  Magellan's  long stay at  Port St Ju  an  he was visited by numbers of this tall Race The first approached him singing and flinging the Dust over his head and shewed all signs of a mild and peaceable disposition his visage was painted his Garment the skin of some Animal neatly sewed his Arms a stout and thick Bow a quiver of long Arrows feathered at one end and armed at the other with Flint The height of these People was about seven Feet  French  but they were not so tall as the Person who approached them first who is represented to have been of so Gigantic a size that  Magellan's  Men did not with their Heads reach as high as the waist of this  Patagonian  They had with them Beasts of Burden on which they placed their Wives by  Magellan's  description of them they appear to have been the Animals now known by the Name of  Llama  These Interviews ended with the captivating two of the People who were carry'd away in two different Ships but as soon as they arrived in the hot Climate each of them died  I dwell the longer on this account as it appears extremely deserving of credit as the courage of  Magellan  made him incapable of giving an exaggerated account through the influence of fear nor could there be any mistake about the height as he had not only a long intercourse with them but the actual possession of two for a very considerable space of time  Vide  Ram  sias  Coll Voyages  Venice  also the Letter of  Maximilian Transylvanus  Sec to  Charles  V and in the st Vol p A and B  It was  Magellan  who first gave them the name of  Patagons  because thy wore a sort of slipper made of the skin of Animals Tellement says  M de Brosse  This Account as well as the others where I do not quote my Authority are taken from that  ditious Writer  M de Brosse  quils paroissoit avoir des pattes de BÃªtes'  In  Garcia de Louisa  saw within the streights of  Magellan  savages of a very great stature but he does not particularize their height  After  Louisa  the same Streights were passed in by  Simon de Alcazova  and attempted in by  Alphonso de Camargo  but without being visited by our tall People  The same happened to our Countryman Sir  Francis Drake  but because it was not the fortune of that able and popular seaman to meet with these gigantic People his Contemporaries considered the report as the invention of the  Spaniards  In  Pedro Sarmiento  asserts that those he saw were three Ells high this is a Writer I would never venture to quote singly for he destroys his own credibility by saying the Savage he made prisoner was an errant  Cyclops  I only cite him to prove that he had fell in with a tall race tho' he mixes Fable with Truth  In Our Countryman Sir  Thomas Cavendish  in his Voyage had only opportunity of measuring one of their footsteps which was eighteen inches long he also found their Graves and mentions their customs of burying near the shore  Purchas    In  Anthony Knevet  who sailed with Sir  Thomas Cavendish  in his second Voyage relates that he saw at  PortDesire  Men fifteen or sixteen spans high and that he measured the bodies of two that had been recently buried which were fourteen spans long  Purchas  Col Voy by the  Dutch East India  Company c  Dondon  p    Sebald de Veert  who sailed with Admiral  de Cordes  was attacked in the streight  Magellan  by savages whom he thought to be ten or eleven feet high he adds that they were of reddish color and had long hair  Ibid  In the same Year  Oliver du Nort  a  Dutch  Admiral had a rencontre with this gigantic race whom he represents to be of a high stature and of a terrible aspect    George Spilbergen  another  Dutchman  in his passage thro' the same streight saw a Man of a gigantic stature climbing a hill as if to take a view of the Ship  Purchas      Le Maire  and  Schouten  discovered some of the burying places of the  Patagonians  beneath heaps of great stones and found in them Skeletons ten or eleven feet long  Ibid  Mr  Falkener  supposes that formerly there existed a race of  Patagonians  superior to these in size for skeletons are often found of far greater dimensions particularly about the River  Texeira  Perhaps he may have  heard of the old tradition of the natives mentioned by  Cieza  Seventeen Years Travels of  Peter de Cieza    and repeated from him by  Garcilasso de la Vega  Translated by  Ricaut  p  of certain Giants having come by sea and landed near the cape of St  Helena  many ages before the arrival of the  Europeans    Gracias de Nodal  a  Spanish  Commander in the course of his Voyage was inform'd by  John Moore  one of his crew who landed between  Cape  St  Esprit  and  Cape  St  Arenas  on the S side of the Streights that he trafficked with a race of Men taller by the head than the  Europeans  This and the next are the only instances I ever met with of the tall race being found on this side of the Streights    Henry Brewer  a  Dutch  Admiral observed in the Streights  le Maire  the footsteps of Men which measured eighteen inches this is the last evidence in the th Century of the existence of these tall People but let it be observ'd that out of the fifteen first Voyagers who passed through the  Magellanic  Streights not fewer than nine are undeniable Witnesses of the fact we would establish  In the present Century I can produce but two evidences of the existence of the tall  Patagonians  The one in when the crew of a ship belonging to St  Maloes  commanded by  Captain Harrington  saw seven of these Giants in  Gregory  Bay Mention is also made of six more being seen by  Captain Carman  a Native of the same Town but whether in the same Voyage my authority is silent  Frezier's  Voy  BUT as it was not the fortune of the four other Voyagers  Sir  John Narborough  in  Bartholomew Sharp  in  De Ge  es  in and  Beauchesne Gouin  in  who sailed through the streights in the th Century to fall in with any of this tall race it became a fashion to treat as fabulous the account of the preceding nine and to hold this lofty race as the mere creation of a warm Imagination  In such a temper was the public on the return of Mr  Byron  from his Circumnavigation in the Year I have not the honor of having had personal conference with that Gentleman therefore will not repeat the accounts I have been inform'd he has given to several of his friends I rather chuse to recapitulate that given by Mr  Clarke  O  ficer commanded the  Discovery  in  Captain Cooks  last Voyage and died off  Kamtschatka August    in the Philosophical  Transactions for p Mr  Clarke  was Officer in Mr  Byrons  ship landed with him in the streights of  Magellan  and had for two hours an opportunity of standing within a few yards of this race and seeing them examined and measured by Mr  Byron  He represents them in general as stout and well proportion'd and assures us that none of the Men were lower than eight feet and that some even exceeded nine and that the Women were from seven feet and an half to eight feet he law Mr  Byron  measure one of the Men and notwithstanding the Commodore was near six feet high he could when on tip toe but just reach with his hand the top of the  Patagonian's  head and Mr  Clarke  is certain that there were several taller than him on whom the experiment was made for there was about five hundred Men Women and Children They seem'd very happy at the landing of our people and expressed their joy by a rude sort of singing They were of a copper color and had long lank hair and faces hideously painted both sexes were cover'd with skins and some appeared on horseback and others on foot  M de Premontel  makes this an object of ridicule as if the size of the horses were unequal to the burden of the riders Our Navigators tell us that the horses were fifteen or sixteen feet high It is well known that a Millhorse has been known to carry nine hundred and ten pounds a weight probably beyond that of any  Patagonian  they saw  A few had on their legs a sort of boot with a sharp pointed stick at the heel instead of a spur Their bridles were made of thong the bit wood the saddle as artless as possible and without stirrups The introduction of horses into these parts by the  Europeans  introduced likewise the only species of manufacture they appear to be acquainted with All their skill seems to extend no further than these rude essays at a harness and to equip themselves for  Cavaliers  In other respects they would be in the same state as our first parents just turned out of paradise cloathed in coats of skins or at best in the same condition in which  Caesar  found the ancient  Britons  for their dress was similar their hair long and their bodies like those of our Ancestors made terrific by wild painting These people by some means or other had acquired a few beads and bracelets otherwise not a single article of  European  fabric appeared among them These they must have gotten by the intercourse with the other  Indian  tribes for had they had any intercourse with the  Spaniards  they never would have neglected procuring knives the stirrups and other conveniences which the people seen by Mr  Wallis  had  I should have been glad to have closed in this place these relations of this stupendous race of Mankind because the two following accounts given by gentlemen of character and abilities seem to contradict great part of what had been before advanced or at left serve to give scoffers room to say that the preceding Navigators had seen these people thro' the medium of magnifying glasses instead of the sober eye of observation but before I make my remarks on what has been before related I shall proceed with the other Navigators and then attempt to reconcile the different accounts In Captain  Wallis  of the  Dolphin  and Captain  Philip Carteret  of the  Swallow  Sloop saw and measured with a pole several of the  Patagonians  who happen'd to be in the streights of  Magellan  during his passage  P  Tr  s    p  Hawkes    Voy    he represents them as a fine and friendly people cloathed in skins and on their legs a sort of boots and many of them tied their hair which was long and black with a sort of woven stuff of the breadth of a garter made of some kind of wool That their arms were slings formed of two round balls fasten'd one to each end of a cord which they fling with great force and dexterity He adds they hold one ball in their hand and swing the other at the full length of the cord round their head by which it acquires a prodigious velocity they will fling it to a great distance and with such exactness as to strike a very small object these people were also mounted on Horses their faddles bridles c were of their own making some had iron and others metal bits to their bridles and one had a  Spanish  broad sword but whether the last articles were taken by war or procured by commerce is uncertain but the last is most probable It seems evident that they had intercourse with  Europeans  and had even adopted some of their fashions for many had cut their dress into form of  Spanish Punches  or a square piece of cloth with a hole cut for the head the rest hanging  loose as low as the knees They also wore drawers so these people had attained a few steps farther towards civilization than their gigantic neighbors others again will appear to have made a far greater advance for these still devour'd their meat raw and drank nothing but water  M Bougainville  in the same year saw another party of the natives of  Patagonia  he measured several of them and declares that none were lower than five feet five inches  French  or taller than five feet ten i e five feet ten or six feet three  English  measure he concludes his account with saying that he afterwards met with a taller people in the S sea but I do not recollect that he mentions the place  I am sorry to be obliged to remark in these voyages a very illibral propensity to cavil at and invalidate the account given by Mr  Byron  but at the same time exult in having an opportunity given me by that Gentleman of vindicating his and the national honor  M Bougainville  in order to prove he fell in with the identical people that Mr  Byron  conversed with asserts that he saw numbers of them possessed of knives of an  English  manufactory certainly given them by Mr  Byron  but he should have considered that there are more ways than one of coming at a thing that the commerce between  Sheffield  and  South America  through the port of  Cadiz  is most uncommonly large and that his  Indians  might have got their knives from the  Spaniards  at the same time that they got their gilt nails and  Spanish  harness but for farther satisfaction on this subject I have liberty to say from Mr  Byron's  authority that he never gave a single knife to the people he saw that he had not one at that time about him that excepting the presents given with his own hands and the tobacco brought by Lieutenant  Cummins  not the least trifle was bestowed I am furnished with one other proof that these lesser  Indians  whom Mr  Wallis  saw were not the same with those described by Mr  Byron  as has been insinuated for the first had with him some officers who had been with him on the preceding Voyage and who bear witness not only to the difference of size but declare that these people had not a single article among them given by Mr  Byron  See Mr  Byrons  letter at the end  It is extremely probable that these were the  Indians  that Mr  Bougainville  fell in with for they were furnished with bits a  Spanish  scymeter and brass stirrups as before mentioned  My last evidence of these gigantic  Americans  is that which I received from Mr  Falkener  he acquainted me that about the year he was sent on a misson to the vast plains of  Pampas  which if I recollect right lies to the S W of  Buenos Ayres  and extends near a thousand miles towards the  Andes  In these plains he first met with some tribes of these people and was taken under the protection of one of the  Caciques  The remarks he made on their size were as follows that the tallest which he measured in the same manner that Mr  Byron  did was seven feet eight inches high that the common height or middle size was six feet that there were numbers that were even shorter and that the tallest Women did not exceed six feet That they were scattered from the foot of the  Andes  over that vast tract which extends to the  Atlantic Ocean  and are found as far as the  red river  at Bay  Anagada  lat below that the land is too barren to be habitable and none are found except accidental migrants till you arrive at the river  Gallego  near the streights of  Magellan  They are supposed to be a race derived from the  Chilian Indians  the  Puelches  who inhabited the eastern side of the  Andes  the same brave nation who defeated and destroyed the avaritious  Spaniard Baldivia  but after that were dispossess'd of their seat  They dwell in large tents covered with the hides of Mares and divided within into Apartments for the different ranks of the Family by a sort of blanketting They are a most migratory people and often shift their quarters when the Women strike the tents assist in putting them on their horses and like the females of all savage countries undergo all the laborious work  They have two motives for shifting their quarters one for the sake of getting salt which they find incrusted in the shallow pools near the sea side  The other inducement is the superstition they have of burying their dead within a certain distance of the ocean and I may certainly add a third that of the necessity they must lie under of seeking fresh quarters on account of the chace which is their principal subsistance  Those who deny the existence of these great People never consider the migratory nature of the Inhabitants of this prodigious tract and never reflect that the tribes who may have been seen this month on the coast may the next be some hundreds of miles inland and their place occupied by a tribe or nation totally different These Gentlemen seem to lay down as a certain position that  Patagonia  is peopled by only a single nation and from that false principle they draw their arguments sneer insult and even grossly abuse all that differ in opinion Among the most illiberal of these writers is  M de Premontel  who with the rapid ingenuity of his country mounts on his head strong courser PREJUDICE sets off full speed rides over all the honest fellows that would inform him of his road and spurns even truth herself tho' she offers to be his guide but truth is unadorned and hated by this fantastic writer would spoil him of all the flowers of fiction and tropes of abuse against a rival country would teach him facts that would ruin his argument and reduce his eloquent memoire to a single narrative of uncontested veracity  Their food is almost entirely animal the flesh of Horses Oxen Guanacoes and Ostriches all of which they eat roasted or boiled Their drink is water except in the season when certain species of Fruit are ripe for of those they make a sort of fermenting Liquor called  Chucha  common to many parts of South America One kind is made of a podded fruit called  Algarrova  which smells like a bug and when bruised in Water becomes an inebriating Liquor The same fruit is also eaten as bread The other  Chucha  is made of the  Molic  a small fruit hot and sweet in the Mouth both these cause a deep drunkenness especially the last which excites a phrenetic inebriation and a wildness of Eyes which lasts two or three Days  The Cloathing of these People is either a mantle of Skins or of a Woolen  The  Puelches  have no Sheep but what they purchase from the  V  luches  who Inhabit the  Andes  cultivate Sheep and raise Corn the Wool is equally fine with that of  old Spain  Cloth manufactur'd by themselves some is so strong and compact as even to hold Water the color is various for some are striped and dyed with the richest red made of Cochineel and certain Roots They wear a short apron before which is tucked between the Legs and preserves a modest appearance They never wear feather'd ornaments except  in their Dances Their Hair is long and tied up with a fillet They have naturally Beards  M Premontel  roundly asserts that they have no beards  but they generally pluck up the Hairs not but some leave Mustaches as was observ'd by Mr  Carteret  and  M Bougainville  When they go to War they wear a fourfold Coat of the Skin of the  Tapier  a Cap of Bull's hide doubled and a broad Target of the same Their offensive Weapons are Bows and Arrows the last headed with bone launces headed with Iron and broad swords both which they procure from the  Spaniards  but their native Weapons are Slings of these they have two kinds one for War which consists of a thong headed with Stone at only one end and during their Campaigns they carry numbers of these wraped about their bodies  The Slings which they use in the chace of Horses Cattle or Ostriches have a Stone fixed to each end and sometimes another thong with a third Stone is fasten'd to the middle of the other these with amazing dexterity they fling round the objects of the chace be they Beasts or Ostriches which entangle them so that they cannot stir The Indians leave them I may say thus tied neck and heels and go on in pursuit of fresh Game and having finish'd their sport return to pick up the Animals they left secur'd in the slings  Their Wars are chiefly with the other  Indians  for  Patagonia  is inhabited by variety of People not a single nation They have a great deal of intercourse with the  Spaniards  and often come down to  Buenos Ayres  to trade for Iron Bugles c  This commerce with the  Europeans  has corrupted them greatly taught them the vice of dramdrinking and been a dreadful obstacle to their moral improvement Mr  Falkener  inform'd me that he once prevaled on about five hundred to form a reduction but that they grew unruly and ungovernable as soon as the  Spanish  Traders got among them  Their War and their chace are carried on Horseback for they are most expert riders and have multitudes of Horses with which the Country is perfectly overrun for they go in herds of thousands The price of a Horse at present is two Dollars or  s  and  d  provided it has been  broken About the Year  Garcilassa de la Vega  Engl transl  near the time of the Conquest of  Peru  the common price of one was from four to six thousand to ten thousand  Pesos  Pesos  in the original perhaps  Pesos duros  which makes the above Sum  or from  l  to  l English  The venereal distemper is common among them They do not speak of it as an exotic disorder so probably it is aboriginal  In respect to religion they allow two principles a good and a bad  M de Premontal  is clear they have no sort of Religion  The good they call the  Creator of all things  but consider him as one that after that never sollicits himself about them He is styled by some  Soucha  or chief in the Land of  strong drink  by others  Gauyaracunnee  or  Lord of the dead  The  evil principle  is called  Hucccovoe  or the  wanderer without  Sometimes these for there are several are supposed to preside over particular Persons protect their own People or injure others These are likewise call'd  Valichu  or dwellers  in the air  They have Priests and Priestesses whose office is to mediate with these Beings in case of sickness or any distress by the intervention of the Priest they are consulted about future events at those seasons the Priest shuts himself up and falls into a phrenetic extacy  The pretenders to second sight in the  He  rides  and the  Awenyddion  or the  Inspired  among the  Welch  are seized with the same extasie  and appears epileptic If he gives a wrong answer he lays the fault on the evil principle who he says had deceived him by not coming in person but only sent one of his slaves At these times the great People assemble about the cabin from whence the Oracle is to be delivered waiting its report with great anxiety  If a  Cazique  dies or any public calamity happens for example in particular when the small pox had made great ravages among the Tribes the Priests are sure to suffer for the misfortune is presumed to have happened thro' their neglect in not deprecating the evil in these cases they have no other method of saving themselves but by laying the blame on others of their Brethren  Priests are chosen from among the young People the most effeminate they can find but those that are epileptic have always the preference and these dress in a female habit  The  Puelches  have a notion of a future state and imagine that after death they are to be transported to a Country where the fruits of inebriation are eternal there to live in immortal drunkenness and the perpetual chace of the Ostrich  When a Person of eminence dies the most respectable Women in the place goes into the Tent clears the Body of all the intestines and scrapes off as much of the flesh from the bones as possible and then burns very carefully both that and the entrails when that is done the bones are buried till the rest of the flesh is quite decay'd they are taken up within a year and if any of the bones drop out of their places they are refixed and tied together and the whole form'd into a perfect skeleton Thus complete it is packed up in a hide put on the back of a favorite Horse of the deceased and then translated to the Tomb of his Ancestor perhaps miles distant and always within a small space from the Sea  The skeleton is then taken out and deck'd in its best Robes and adorn'd with plumes and beads is placed siting in a deep square pit parallel with those buried before with Sword Launce and other Weapons placed by them and the skins of their Horses stuff'd and supported by stakes also accompany them The top of the pit is that cover'd with Turf placed on transverse Beams  A Matron is appointed to attend these Sepulchers whose office it is to keep the Skeletons clean and to new Cloath them Annually  This account agrees with those given by  Lafitau  in most particulars vide  Maeurs des Sauvages    I forgot to add that on deposeting a Skeleton in its Tomb the  Puelches  make a libation of  Chucha  and like what I have heard of an honest  Spaniard  drank  viva el morte  long live the dead  They allow Polygamy and marry promiscuously among other  Americans  they are allowed as many as three Wives apiece but if any take more htan that number he is esteemed a libertine and held in very little esteem  Widows black their Faces for a Year after their Husbands decease  In respect to Government the  Caziques  are hereditary it is their business to protect the property of tehir People and they have power of life  and death the office is far from being elegible many reject it because they are oblig'd to pay all their People for their services who may at pleasure change their  Caziques  so that several refuse to accept new vassals who may offer themselves for it is not allow'd any  Indian  to live out of the protection of some  Cazique  in such a case he would certainly be looked on as an outlaw  Eloquence is in high esteem with them If a  Cazique  wants that talent he keeps an orator just as leaders in opposition have been known to do among us  This closes the history Mr  Falkener  favored me with but I must not quit that Gentleman without informing you that he return'd to  Europe  with a suit of  Patagonian  Cloth a Cup of Horn and a little Pot made of  Chilian  copper the whole fruits the  Spaniards  left him after the labors of a thirty eight years mission  From the preceding account it appears that the country which goes under the name of  Patagonia  extending from the River  la Plata  Lat to the streights of  Magellan  Lat  M de Premontal  will compare  Patagonia  to the space between the  Riviere des Sardines  and the streights of  Magellan  and westward as far as the  Andes  is inhabited by Men who may be divided into three different Classes and to them may be added a fourth a combination or mixture of others  The first is a race of Men of common size who have been seen by numbers and whose existence is indisputable These often are seen on the northern side of the streights of  Magellan  and oftner on the  Terra del Fuego  side even as low as opposite to  Cape Horn  These are frequently an exiled race unhappy fugitives drove by their enemies to take shelter from their fury in those distant parts for such is the information Mr  Falkener  received from some  Indians  he met with in the southern parts of  Patagonia  and this will account for the settled melancholy of the People observed by the Navigators in  Terra del Fuego  The second Class consists of those who in general exceed the common height of  Europeans  by a few inches or perhaps the head such were those who were seen by  John Moore  who sail'd with  Gracias de Nodal  in by Mr  Carteret  in and by  M Bougainville  in the same year  The third Class is compos'd of those whose height is so extraordinary as to occasion so great a disbelief of the accounts of Voyagers and yet they are indisputable an existent People they have been seen by  Magellan  and six other in the th Century and by two if not three in the present  The fourth Class is a mixed race who careless about preserving their generous and exalted breed pure and undegenerate have degraded themselves by intermixing with the puny tribes of the country and from that intercourse have produced a mongrel breed of every size except that of the original standard some few as if by accident seem to aspire to the height of their ancestors but are checked in their growth and stop at the stature of seven feet eight inches scarce the middle size of the genuine breed But another reason maybe assigned for the degeneracy and inequality of size in this Class they live within the neighborhood of  Europeans  they have intercourse with them and from them they have acquired the vice of dram drinking and all its horrible consequences this alone is sufficient to make a nation of giants dwindle into pygmies  A third reason may still be assigned  viz  The introduction of manufacturies among them Those people who depended on the spoils of the chase for their habiliments were certain of preserving their full vigor their strength of constitution and fullness of habit while those who are confin'd to the loom grow enervate and lose much of the force of their bodily faculties They also live in tents lin'd with woollen manufacture which doubtlessly are much more delicate luxurious and warm than the dwellings of the third undegenerate Class We are unacquainted with the form of their tents but we know that they still cloath themselves with the skins of beasts and that among those Mr  Clarke  saw there was not the lest appearance of manufactury excepting what related to their horse furniture These seem to have been the genuine remains of the free race the conquerors of  Pedro de Baldivia  the  Puelches  whose original station was among the  Andes  of  Chiloe  in about  Latitude  and almost due east of the isle of  Chiloe  These were the descendents of the  Indians  who retreated to the south far out of the common track of  Europeans  and who retain their primaval grandeur of size the others  who fled northeast forgetful of their orignal magnificent stature lost in general that noble distinction by unsuitable alliances and the use of spirits while the first probably only marry among themselves and certainly have all strong liquor in abhorrence some of this tall race seem still to inhabit the stations of their Ancestors or some not very remote from them for  M Frezier  was assur'd by  Don Pedro Molina  Govenor of  Chiloe  that he once was visited by some of these People who were four  varas  or about nine or ten feet high they came in company with some  Chiloe Indians  Frezier's  Voyage p  with whom they were friends and who probably found them in some of their excursions  M de Premontal  insults  M Frezier  with much acrimony on account of this relation and charges him with changing the seat of those People from the eastern coast to the western or the tract between  Chiloe  and the  Magellanic  streights but the truth is that  Frezier  says no such thing but mentions them as a nation living up the country inland not near the shores  M Premontal  also sneers at the evidence of the crews of the  Maloe  ships but they by no means place these tall People on the western coast of  S America  but at  Gregory Bay  a place very little distant from the eastern entrance of the  Streights  and near which these giants have been more frequently seen than any where else  My remarks on  M de Premontal  are but a tribute to the many civilities I have received from doctor  Matie  who has been most unprovokedly unjustly and illiberally abused by this vague and pragmatical writer  Thus I conclude all that I collect relating to these singular People Let me beg you to receive the account with your usual Candor and think me with the most regard  Dear Sir  Your faithful and affect humble Servant THOMAS PENNANT  Downing  November  th  Copy of a Paper transmitted from Admiral  Byron  to me through the hands of the Right Reverend  John Egerton  late Bishop of  Durham  after he had perused the Manuscript of the foregoing account  The People I saw upon the coast of  Patagonia  were not the same that was seen the second Voyage One or two of the Officers that sail'd with me and afterwards with Captain  Wallace  declar'd to me that they had not a single thing I had distributed amongst those I saw  M Bougainville  remarks that his officers landed amongst the  Indians  I had seen as they had many  English  knives amongst them which were as he pretends undoubtedly given by me now it happen'd that I never gave a single knife to any of those  Indians  nor did I even carry one a shore with me  I had often heard from the  Spaniards  that there were two or three different nations of very tall People the largest of which inhabit those immense plains at the back of the  Andes  The others some where near the river  Galiegos  I take it to be the former that I saw and for this reason returning from  Port Famine  where I had been to wood and water I saw those Peoples fires a long way to the westward of where I had left them and a great way inland so as the winter was approaching they were certainly returning to a better climate I remarked that they had not one single thing amongst them that shewed they ever had any commerce with  Europeans  They were certainly of a most amazing size so much were their horses disproportion'd that all the People that were with me in the boats when very near the shore swore that they were all mounted upon deer and to this instant I believe there is not
