 AN INQUIRY INTO THE ORIGIN of EPISCOPACY IN A DISCOURSE PREACHED IN JUNE  By a DIGNITARY of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND  PRINTED BY SIMMONS AND CO CANTERBURY  ADVERTISEMENT  The Author would feel himself much honoured and obliged by any Remarks addressed to his Printer from those learned Churchmen to whose consideration these sheets at present not intended for the public eye are respectfully submitted  HEBREWS  th  CHAP  th  VERSE  OBEY THEM THAT HAVE THE RULE OVER YOU AND SUBMIT YOURSELVES FOR THEY WATCH FOR YOUR SOULS AS THEY THAT MUST GIVE AN ACCOUNT  IN examining a Religion which pretends to come from God one of the  first  things which forceth itself upon our attention is the  Influence  of its  Doctrines  and  Precepts  upon human  Felicity  If the natural tendency of  these  be to  regulate  the passions and to  promote  the general Happiness of Mankind a strong presumption ariseth that its pretensions to a divine origin  may  be well founded But if a Religion obviously tendeth to  lessen  human happiness or  to  disturb the peace of Society  we may without further examination conclude with  certainty  that it cometh  not  from that great and beneficent Being who far from delighting in the misery of his creatures would have  all  to be pious and virtuous  only  that  all  may be finally and completely happy in those realms where Death hath no dominion  Viewed in  this  light Christianity is  eminently  distinguished above every other religious Institution which hath hitherto prevailed in the world It teacheth in perfection the duties of  Man  to  Man  it affordeth  divine  aids to  human  weakness and encourageth the practice of what it sheweth to be good by motives the most engaging and the most exalted  Christian Religion exhorteth us to be mindful of  whatsoever things are true honest just pure lovely or of good report  to forgive our enemies to love our neighbours as ourselves to do good as  we have opportunity to every individual of the human race and as much as lieth in us to live peaceably with all men  In Society  only  are these duties  practicable  and without Government and Subordination  Society could not subsist  Therefore the divine Author and Finisher of our Faith  in order to give efficacy to his other commands  enforced obedience to the civil Magistrate  by an injunction of the Gospel  requiring his followers to  render unto  Caesar  the things that were  Caesar's    as well as  unto  God  the things that were  God's  The  same  course of salutary instruction was faithfully pursued by the Apostles and others the first Preachers of Christianity who earnestly exhorted their Converts to  render to  all  their dues tribute to whom tribute was due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour to submit themselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's  sake whether to the King as supreme or to Magistrates as unto them who are sent by him for the Punishment of evildoers and for the Praise of them that do well  To  these  Precepts of  Civil Obedience  no objection of importance hath ever been made They are on the contrary applauded both by the believer and by the unbelieverby him who reverenceth the Gospel as the power of God unto Salvationand by him who considereth it as a cunningly devised fable calculated  merely  to erect a Dominion over the consciences of men  But the Precept of my  Text  hath frequently been viewed in a light  less favourable  It  certainly supposeth  an Authority different from that of the  civil  Magistrate  whose  Duty is to watch  not  for the  Souls    but  for the  Lives  and  Properties  of his subjects and to  that  Authority St Paul here enjoineth an  Obedience  which the  children  of this world  are  little willing to pay  It would be idle to reason in support of  spiritual Authority  with such as doubt or deny the divine origin of the Gospel for THESE MEN must be convinced that they HAVE SOULS before they can be persuaded to enquire WHO are appointed to  watch  for them to WHOM on  that  account their obedience is due or WHAT is the  Nature  and  Extent  of the obedience required  THEY are not however ALL infidels who  deny  the reality of spiritual Powersfor many sincere believers in Christianity contend that under the Gospeldispensation there is nothing which bears the smallest resemblance to an exclusive Priesthood that the Authority which is supposed in my Text either ceased with the Apostles or that if it still continueth in the Church it can be conferred on one class of Christians  only  by the  Election  of others and that  therefore  we are bound  to obey it  no farther  than is necessary to preserve  Decency  and  Order  in the conduct of public worship  That our blessed Lord gave to none of his immediate followers Authority or Jurisdiction of  such a nature  as to interfere with the Rights of the Rulers of the Earth is indeed an undoubted Truthfor  all such Authority  was disclaimed by  Himself    My kingdom  said He to Pilate  is not of this world  And upon being asked by a certain person to decide a  question of Property  between him and his brother his Reply was  Man  who  made  me  a Judge or a Divider over you  But when it is considered that Christ came into the world to  turn men from Darkness unto Light and from the Power of Satan unto God  that  He gave himself for us that He might redeem us from  all  Iniquity and purify to himself a peculiar people  zealous  of good works  and that of  these works very many  are such  as unregenerate humanity cannot perform and that the  Doctrines  which he revealed are such as  human Reason  could  never  have discovered it will be seen how  necessary  it was that when he ascended into Heaven he should substitute some  Authority  on Earth to  illustrate the Revelation  which he had  given  and to  enforce obedience  to the  Laws  which he had  enacted  There is nothing more strictly required of Christians than that they should live together in  Unity  professing the  same  Faith joining in the  same  Worship and practising the  same  Virtues on the  same  Principles Now as Men have  different  Passions Prejudices and Pursuits  such Unity  would be impossible were they  not  linked together in  one  Society under the Government of Persons authorised to  watch over the Faith  to  prescribe the Forms of public Worship  and to  inculcate the necessity  and  explain the Nature  and  Extent  of the  several Virtues  In the Scriptures of the New Testament the Society of Christians is on account of its unity and organization compared to the human body  for as we have  many  members in  one  body and all members have not the  same office  so  we  being many are  one Body  in Christ and every one  members one of another    Rom XII  ▪ This Society of Believers in our common Deliverer is called the CHURCH 'the  Kingdom of God  'and 'the  Kingdom of Heaven  ' and ITS affairs like the affairs of every other Kingdom are administered by  proper  officers in subordination to  the one Lord  who  when he ascended on high and led captivity captive gave  some  Apostles and  some  Prophets and  some  Evangelists and  some  Pastors and Teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the Ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ that henceforth we should be  no more  children tossed to and fro and carried  about with  every  wind of Doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into  Him  in all things which is the Head even Christ from  whom  the whole Body fitly joined together and compacted by  that  which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of  every  part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love    Ephes IV    Nowof  this  Society as of a philosophical Sect it is  not  left to  every  man's choice as a thing indifferent whether or  not  he will become a Member ALL who embrace the Faith of the Redeemer of the world are required to be  baptized  under the pain of forfeiting the  benefits of Redemption  St Mark XVI St John III But  one great purpose  proposed by the institution of Baptism was the Initiation  of Persons into the Church of Christ  For  by one Spirit  saith St Paul  Cor XII    are we all baptized  into one Body  whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free  Of  Baptism  whatever be the Importance it is evident that to receive it is  not  like moral Justice or the Veneration of the Supreme Being a Duty resulting from the  Nature of the Relations of Man  and that  all  its efficacy which in Scripture is said to be  nothing less than the Remission of Sins  Acts II and XXII is derived from  positive Institution  and can accompany the external Rite  only  when  that  Rite is administered in the  manner prescribed  and by the  persons authorised  to administer it  That  all Christians  in common are  not  vested with this authority is plain from the Commission which after his Resurrection the blessed Jesus gave to his Apostles We are assured that the number of  his followers was then  five hundred at least  but it was ONLY to the ELEVEN DISCIPLES that  He came and spake saying All power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth Go YE therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost    St Matthew XXVIII  Now there is no reason to suppose that there were not  many  of the five hundred well qualified to instruct either a Jew or a Gentile in the doctrines of the the Gospel and it is certain that  any one  of them could have washed his Converts with water in the Name of the Holy Trinity as well as St Peter or St John but then such an  unauthorized washing  would not have been  Christian Baptism  or of equal Validity with  it  any more than the  Opinion  of a  Lawyer at the Bar  is the  Judgement of a Court of Justice  or of equal obligation It is the  Commission of the Sovereign  which gives force to the  Judgement of the Court  as it is  the COMMISSION OF CHRIST which gives VALIDITY TO BAPTISM  The  same  Things hold true of the Lord's Supper which if it be  not  administered by Persons having  Authority  for such celebration cannot be deemed a Sacrament of Christ's Institution These two Rites are the external Badges of our Professionby the  one  we are incorporated into that Society of which God our Saviour is the Head and Sovereignof the  other  with all its Advantages we have a Right to partake whilst we continue Members of  that  Society but if by an open and scandalous disregard to the  Precepts  of the Gospel we should prove ourselves Despisers of its  Privileges  the same Persons who are authorized to  admit us into  Christ's Church are likewise vested with Authority to  cast us out  of it for to  them  were given  The Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven  with an assurance that  whatsoever they should  bind  on Earth should  be  bound  in Heaven and whatsoever they should  loose  on Earth should be  loosed  in Heaven  St Matthew XVI and XVIII  And I will give you the Keys of the Gate of this Court or Kingdom the Church of which every one of you is to be the Steward as the Keys of the Court were given to Eliakim Isa XXII in token of his being a Steward of the House to admit and exclude whom he pleased that is both  Power  and  Ensign of Power  Apoc III to exercise censures and by  them  to exclude men in case of their impenitence either by laying some restraint on them in the Church or to turn them out of the gates of  this  city and upon repentance to receive them into the Church again and what you do  here  as you ought to do shall be valid in  Heaven  Hammond's Paraphrase  Now as  Baptism  is to be  administered  so long as there shall be Persons to be enlisted under the Banner of Christ and as the  Lord's Supper  is to be  celebrated  so long as it shall be the Duty of Soldiers to adhere to to the Standard of their Leader and their Head and as it is to be feared that there never will come a time when  all  the servants of Christ shall walk  worthy of the  vocation wherewith they are called  It follows  undeniably  that this  Power of the Keys    See this matter treated in a very masterly manner by Archbishop Potter in his discourse of Church Governmenta book which I beg leave to recommend  earnestly  to every Member of the Church of England and especially to the younger part of my brethren the Clergy  which was  originally  vested in the Apostles must continue in the Church  through all Ages  even unto the  End of the World  But we have seen that it was  not  at first entrusted to  all  the Disciples  in common  as  one  of the Privileges inseparable from their Profession and as  no Body  of men can possibly  transfer  an Authority of which they themselves were never  possessed  it is certain that even  now  it cannot by the Election of  one  Class of Christians be  delegated  to  another  but must by some mode of Succession be  derived  from the  Apostles  who were sent by  Christ  as  He  was sent by his  Father  To argue from the Origin of  civil  to that  of  ecclesiastical  Government although perhaps not  very uncommon  is yet  extremely fallacious  Of the various Nations of the world as particular  Forms  of Government may be devised  on Earth  though  Government itself  is from  above  many of the Sovereigns may indeed derive their Authority from the Suffrages of their Subjects because in a State of Nature every man has an inherent and undoubted Right to defend his Life Liberty and Property and what he possesses in his  own person  he may for the Good of Society transfer to  another  but  no man is  by nature or  can make himself  a Member of the Christian Church and therefore Authority to govern that Society  can  be derived  only  from  Him  by  whom it was founded  and who  died that he might gather together  in one  all the Children of God  Against such reasoning  as this  it hath been sometimes urged that it appeareth inconsistent  with the Wisdom and Goodness of God to make Institutions which like Baptism and the Lord's Supper are  generally  necessary to the Salvation of  all  Christians depend upon the  Authority  and  Commission  of a  particular Order  Because by such an Economy an  intolerable Domination  would be established over the Souls of Men and the purpose for which the Son of God died might in  some degree  be defeated by the Caprice of an  ignorant  and  arbitrary Priesthood  But  this objection  is either of  no  weight or it militates with  equal force  against  all  Religion natural as well as revealed  Although in conformity with the usual mode of expression I have distinguished between  natural  and  revealed  Religion I do not imagine that there ever  was  or  could have been  a consistent scheme of Religion excogitated by the  mere strength of human Genius  the Authors who detail to us Systems of what is called the  Religion of Nature  borrow sometimes without adverting to it their Principles from the Holy Scriptures and then not unfrequently turn against Revelation  those arms  with which  it  hath furnished themIn vigour of Intellect  Plato  and  Cicero  were surely  not inferior  to  Mr Woolaston  and yet it is certain that in their writings are not to be found  so many Truths  and  so few mistakes  relating to the Supreme Being as He has exhibited in  one small Volume  Whence then had the Author of  the Religion of Nature delineated  this superiority over the greatest Men of AntiquityUndoubtedly from his knowledge of those Truths which are recorded in the Old and New Testaments and of which the Philosophers of Athens and Rome knew  nothing  except what had come down to them from the primeval times through the precarious conveyance of oral traditionWhen a proposition is  once  known to be true it requires no extraordinary strength of mind to understand the  Grounds  of its Truth He must be a very weak man who could not be made to understand the demonstration of the Pythagorean Theorem and yet I hope there is not one of my Readers who does not think himself indebted to the Sage who made the discoveryThe Case is similar with respect to Religion Its doctrines and precepts are  now known  and of these doctrines  many  are of such a nature that a wellcultivated mind comprehends without difficulty  the reasons upon which they rest  concerning  others  we may well be contented with the plain though narrow view of them which is laid before us in the sacred writingsfor prying into those Mysteries like gazing on the Sun  begins in Pain    and ends in Blindness  The fitness of the Precepts of Revelation for such a Creature is easily discerned but it does not therefore follow that the System could have been excogitated by human Reason any more than that every man of ordinary capacity is equal to Pythagoras  and even against the Wisdom of Providence in the Government of the World  In every thing relating both to their  temporal  and their  spiritual  Interests Mankind  are  all  subjected to  mutual Dependence  The  Rich  depend upon the  Poor  and the  Poor  upon the  Rich  An Infant neglected from the Birth would  barely cry and cease to live    nor is it very easily to be conceived how in the more rigid Climates a fullgrown man could  without assistance  provide even the Necessaries of mere animal Life Of RELIGION it is certain that in such a situation  nothing  could be known For there is not the  smallest  Reason to imagine that  any  Individual of the human racean Aristotlea Baconor a Newtonhad he been left alone from his Infancy  without  culture and  without  education could ever by the  native Vigour of his own mind  have discovered the Existence of a God or that such speculations as might be supposed to lead to that Discovery would have employed  any  Portion of his Time or his Thoughts  Even  in Society  it would be impossible for  any Man  without the Assistance of others to understand in the  present Age  the  very first Principles of Christianity  for the Scriptures in which  alone  those Principles can be found are written in Languages which are  now  no where  vernacular  In the Fidelity of Translators therefore every illiterate Disciple of Jesus  must confide  for the  Truth  of those Doctrines which constitute the  Foundation of all his Hopes  and as  no  man ever pretended that the  Christian Sacraments  are more  necessary  to Salvation than the  Christian Faith  where is the  impropriety  or  inconsistency  of those Persons receiving the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper by the ministration of  others  who by such  ministration  must of  necessity  receive the Truths of the Gospel  Having thus shewn that there  is  in the Church a STANDING ORDER OF MEN to whom in the Affairs of Religion the  great Body of Christians  ought  or are  bound to pay obedience  it remains to be enquired WHO they are that among the  various Pretenders  have the  best  Claim to this SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY  One Party  maintains that originally the Officers of the Church were ALL Presbyters of ONE ORDER and vested with equal Powers Whilst  others  and the Church of England especially hold that Christ and his Apostles appointed DIVERS ORDERS of Ministers in the Church that of THESE ORDERS the HIGHST ALONE was vested with Authority to ORDAIN OTHERS and that  therefore  Obedience as to those  who watch for our Souls  can be due ONLY to such as are EPISCOPALLY ORDAINED  This is the  famous Question  concerning the apostolic Model of ChurchGovernment which has almost from the beginning of the Reformation been agitated between  us  and the  Dissenters of the Presbyterian Sect  The Plea urged in Behalf of the Presbyterians is that the Titles  Bishop  and  Presbyter  being in the New Testament indifferently given to the  same  Persons cannot be the Titles of  distinct  ecclesiastical Officers which appears it is said  still more evident  from the Ordination of Timothy who although the  first  Bishop of Ephesus was vested with his episcopal Character by the Imposition of the  Hands of the Presbytery  That  one  and the  same Man  is in the New Testament sometimes called a  Bishop  and sometimes a  Presbyter  cannot perhaps be denied but although every apostolic  Bishop  was therefore undoubtedly a  Presbyter  it does  not  follow that every  Presbyter  was likewise a  Bishop  In the Old Testament Aaron and his Sons are without any Discrimination of Order frequently styled  Priests  as in the New Testament both St Peter and St John call themselves  Presbyters  Pet V John  John And St Paul upon  one  occasion denominates himself a Deacon Coloss See the original Yet I believe  no  man ever supposed that those Apostles were  such ecclesiastical Officers  as  modern presbyterian Ministers    or Deacons  And it is universally known that in the  Jewish  Priesthood there were  different  Orders and that  Aaron  was of an Order  superior  to his  Sons  This  being the Case the  Presbyters  by the laying on of  whose Hands  Timothy was made a Bishop  may  have been of the same Order with St Peter and St John and  if so    his  Consecration was undoubtedly  Episcopal  We are at  all Events    certain  that it was not in the modern sense of the word  Presbyterian  for the Gift which in the first Epistle is said to have been given to him by Prophecy  with the laying on of the Hands of the  Presbytery    is in the second said to have been in him  by the putting on of the  Hands of  St Paul  Persons who are inclined to rest in the  scund of words  and  names  and to suppose that the Members of the Presbytery whose Hands were lain upon Timothy were of the  same  Rank and Order with  modern  Presbyters would perhaps do well to  consider the Import  of the Prep sitions  and  In the first Epistle St Paul exhorts his Son in the Truth not to neglect the  Gift that was given to him by Prophecy    In the second he says  Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the Gift of God which is in thee  but every Lexicon informs us that  with the Genitive case answers to the latin preposition per and denotes the instrumental cause whereas  with the same case answers nearly to unà or unà cum and denotes only  consent  and  concurrence  The Inference is obviousthat ST PAUL WAS THE ONLY ORDAINER  But by the confession of all Parties St Paul was a Bishop in the  highest sense  in which that word is taken and the Powers of the Episcopate  not  being  parcelled  out among  various Partners  of whom  each  possesses only a  share  the Imposition of  his  Hands was sufficient for  every  purpose which could have been effected by the Hands of the  whole College of Apostles  It appears therefore that from the  promiscuous use  of the Titles  Bishop  and  Presbyter    nothing  can with certainty be concluded on  either  Side of this celebrated Question But if instead of resting in  single words  which are always more or less ambiguous we attend to some important  Facts  recorded in the New Testament I think we shall discover in  them  sufficient Evidence that the Government of the  primitive  Church was  prelatical  and  not  administered by a  College of Elders  an our Adversaries are wont to affirm  During our Saviour's Stay upon Earth we know that He had under Him  two distinct Orders  of Ministers the  Twelve  and the  Seventy  and after his Ascension immediately before which he had enlarged the Powers of the Eleven we read of  Apostles Presbyters  and  Deacons  That the  Presbyters  were superior to the  Deacons  and the  Apostles  superior to  both  is universally acknowledged but it hath been said that in Scripture we find  no  Intimation that the  Apostolic  Order was designed for continuanceA Quaker says the same thing of WaterBaptism and I know not by what  Text of Scripture  or by what  Mode of Argument    Those  who upon  this  Plea reject the Apostolic Order of Christian Ministers could overthrow the  Principles  upon which the Disciples of George Fox reject the Use of  that  Rite instituted for the Initiation of Mankind into the Christian Church  They  were the  Eleven    alone  to whom our Saviour said  Go  ye  therefore and teach  all  Nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghostteaching them to observe  all  things whatsoever I have commanded you  Matthew XXVIII And therefore although we frequently find Presbyters and Deacons administering the Sacrament of Baptism we must conclude that as a Judge administers Justice by Authority derived from his Sovereign so those  inferior  Officers of the  Church administered Baptism by  Authority  derived from the  Apostles  Indeed had they pretended to act by  any other Authority  it is not  easy  to conceive how  their Baptism  could have been the  Baptism of Christ  for it was  not  with the external washing by  whomsoever  performed but with the  Eleven  and  their Successors  that Christ promised to  be  always even unto the End of the World  That the Eleven did  not  consider this Promise or the Commission with which it was given as terminating with  their Lives  is evident from their admitting  others  into their  own Order  for which they had competent Authority as having been  sent  by  Christ  as he was  sent  by his  Father  St John XX  When St Paul to magnify his office and to procure to it from the Galatians  that  Reverence which it appears they had withdrawn from  him  and paid to  others  whose Doctrine was probably more palatable  styleth himself  an Apostle not  of Men  neither  by Man  but  by Jesus Christ  and  God the Father    He must have known some who derived their Apostolic Mission from  Men  otherwise he could have claimed  no particular Respect  from what was in his own Apostleship  no particular Distinction  At that very early Period therefore there  must  have been in the Church  Secondary Apostles  if I may  so  denominate them upon whom by Imposition of Hands  This Ceremony of Imposition of Hands in Ordination at which some Moderns take great ossence is confirmed from the Practice of the Apostles and Apostolical Men thus ordaining Deacons Acts VI Pastors or Teachers of the the words Acts XIII and Elders whether Bishops or Presbyters in every City Acts XIV This Practice they certainly derived from the Jews who created Governors of criminal causes or ruling Elders and Masters Doctors and Rabins to be Teachers of the Law  i e  to labour in the word and doctrine by  Imposition of Hands  as Moses did to Joshua Numb XXVII Deut XXXIV and as Maimonides saith he did when he assumed the Seventy to assist him St Cyprian in the third Century speaks of Imposition of Hands as  that  which was to be observed and held from divine Tradition and apostolical observation in the collation to the episcopal Office and the apostolical constitutions give us this as an ordinance of St John the Apostle who doubtless when upon his return from Patmos to Ephesus he regulated the Churches and constituted Bishops did it according to the Rites of the Jews and Practice of the other ApostlesWhence we conclude that the laying on of Hands is no  dental  but a  necessary Rite  of the due Ordination of Bishops Presbyters and Deacons WHITBY on Timothy IV Thus St Paul received an  outward commission  to preach the Gospel and was ordained  by the imposition of hands  Acts XIII And although he was before chosen by Christ to his office and thence entitles himself at large  the Apostle of Jesus Christ  yet being separated by the command of the Holy Ghost but at the same time by  laying on of hands  he then styles himself in consideration of the work to which he was  especially separated  and  ordained    the Apostle of the Gentiles  or by some other signisicant ceremony the Eleven had conferred that Authority which was given to them by their divine Master Such were Matthias and Barnabas such likewise were Timothy Titus and many others whose names are mentioned in the New Testament  That Matthias and Barnabas were of the  Apostolic Order  has I believe never been denied and that Timothy and Titus were  superior  to  modern Presbyters  is equally evident  Timothy was by St Paul empowered to preside over the Presbyters of Ephesus to receive accusations against them to exhort to charge and even to rebuke them and Titus was by the same Apostle left in Crete for the express purpose of setting things in order and  ordaining  Presbyters in every city Now to  exhort  to  charge  and with Authority to  rebuke  one's  equal  is surely  incongruous  and altogether  inconsistent  with that  Parity  of  Order  and  Office  for which our Adversaries  so  strenuosly plead  Even the Commission given to  Titus  seems by much  too extensive  for a  presbyterian Minister  who after having ordained in  one  city could not have proceeded to ordain in  another  without the Consent and Assistance of his Brother and FellowLabourer In a word no man I think who without prejudice reads the  Epistles of St Paul  and  the Apocalypse of St John  can  seriously  believe that Timothy Titus  Epaphroditus Sosthenes Silas and the seven Angels  It is known to every one that in the Old Testament the Title of Angel is sometimes given to the Jewish High Priest and particularly by the Prophet Malachi who calls him  Messenger  of the Lord of Hosts  And that the Angels of the Churches mentioned by St John were Christian High Priests or Bishops presiding over  more than one Congregation  is affirmed by all the ancient writers and hardly will be denied by any man who shall take the Trouble to compare  Scripture with Scripture▪  we are told Acts XIX and that  in the space of two years all they who dwelt in Asia heard from St Paul the word of the Lord Jesus both Jews and Greeks and that the word of God grew mightily and prevailed  But with what Truth or Propriety could this have been said if at the Time of St John's writing the Apocalypse all the Christans of the proconsular Asia were comprized in  seven  Congregations which could assemble each with its proper Pastor  in one place  to perform the duties of public worship  of the seven Churches in Asia were  mere Presbyters  or that the Church was  in those days  governed by a  College of Elders  If from the inspired Penmen of the New Testament we proceed to examine the succeeding writers of the Christian Church we shall find such multiplied and concurring  evidence of the divine Institution of EPISCOPACY as it is impossible to  resist  without  denying  the Truth of all  ancient History  and even  shaking  the Pillars of  Revelation itself  For  in the noble Army of Martyrs  the Witnesses of the Episcopal Government of the Church are  earlier  and  more numerous  by far than  those  who testify that the Gospel of St Matthew was written by  that  Apostle or that the Book of the Apocalypse is canonical Scripture  But it may be said that although the Government of the Church as settled by the Apostles should be granted to have been  prelatical  there is nothing in the New Testament or in the Nature of the Thing to make us imagine a  different  Constitution  absolutely unlawful  The Form of civil Government established by  God himself  over the Children of Israel was certainly  Monarchical  and the  same  Constitution obtained at first in  every Nation under Heaven  of which History giveth any  account Yet  no man  in the  present  Age supposeth a republican or an aristocratical Government inconsistent with the Order of Providence and why then should it be deemed  contrary  to the  Spirit of Christianity  to vary the  external Polity  of the Church in conformity to the  Manners  or  Prejudices  or  civil Constitutions  of the different Nations in which it is placed  This Reasoning would be  conclusive  were not the  Polity  of the Church the  Authority  of her Ministers and the  Validity  of the Christian Sacraments  inseparably united  To Persons who consider the Religion of our adorable Redeemer as a  mere  republication of what is called  the Religion of Nature  nothing to be sure can appear  more trifling  or  more justly ridiculous  than Disputes about the  external Government of the Church  In the opinion of  such Men  it must be a matter of  perfect Indifference  whether she be governed by  Bishops  by  Presbyters  or by the  People at large  for the  only thing  in which  they  can be interested is the  Truth  of the Doctrines taught which rests  not  upon the  Authority  of the  Teacher  but upon  Deductions  of  Reason  and the  Declarations  of  Scripture  if indeed to the Scripture  these Persons  allow  any Deference to be due  Those however who consider Christianity as an  instituted Religion  who believe that  Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners  and to  restore  to them that  forfeited  Inheritance which by  no human means  they could ever have  regained  Persons who consider  Baptism  and the  Lord's Supper  as of  vast Importance  in the great Scheme of universal Redemption and who are convinced that those ordinances derive their Importance  wholly  from  positive Institution  cannot think it a matter of Indifference whether the Hand from which they receive them be the Hand of an Administrator who  derives his Authority from  Christ  or of one who  derives it from the People  VALIDITY or INVALIDITY is then the grand Question and until the Argument is wound up to this Pitch little good can be done  Now it being certain that from the Days of the Apostles to those of Calvin  no man  was authorized to minister in holy things but by Ordination from the Hands of a  Bishop    Should it be granted in Defiance of all Antiquity and as I think in contradiction to the clearest Evidence of Scripture that in the Church there were at first  but two  permanent Orders of Ministers of which the highest were called Bishops or Presbyters  indifferently  and the other Deacons I see no advantage which from such a concession could redound to the Presbyterian cause According to this Supposition the Apostolical Presbyters must have been invested as it is contended they were with all the powers of modern Bishopswith the power of preaching of administering the Sacraments and of  sending  Labourers into Christ's Vineyard But it is notorious that  at the Reformation  and in  every prior period of the Church  of which History makes mention there were  three Orders of Ministers  of which the  Second  was authorized to preach the Gospel and to administer the Sacraments but  not  to  send  Labourers into Christ's Vineyard which was the Prerogative of the  highest  alone That  second  Order being therefore upon this supposition  unknown  in the Apostolic Age must have been introduced into the Church by  no competent Authority  But it is from  it  that the Presbyterians derive their  Mission  which therefore upon their  own  Principles MUST BE TOTALLY VOID Hence it follows that should the Episcopal Church be granted to have deviated from the Apostolic Model which if any Credit be due to the obvious  Sense  of  Scripture  and the unanimous  Verdict  of  Antiquity    she has not done  still  she  is corrupted  only  in  one  part whereas the  Presbyterian Sect  rests  wholly upon a human foundation  See this Argument stated more fully and maintained against much ingenious Sophistry in DR WELLS'S Controversial Letters with the Dissenters  and it being  equally certain  that the  Presbyterians  derive their Orders from  no such Source  it is surely  not without Reason  that we doubt whether the ordinances dispensed in  their  Assemblies be the ordinances of the  Church of Christ  or that we consider the Frequenters of  such  Assemblies especially here in England as guilty of Disobedience to those to whom by every Law  divine  as well as  human  they are in Conscience bound to  submit themselves as to Rulers who have Authority to watch for their Souls  Unimportant  as this Controversy has often been represented it appears to me of  much greater Moment  than many of those which make a mighty noise among the cold and philosophical Christians of the present Day  In all Churches with which I am acquainted are to be found speculative Opinions UNDER WHICH DENOMINATION I do not by any means include the Doctrines of our Lord's essential Divinity and the expiatory nature of his Sacrifice upon the Cross concerning which I may affirm that although they have been often canvassed with much bitterness of contention and have sometimes produced all the  Evils  of Schism a Layman who is not obliged to subscribe the public confession of Faith needs give himself very little trouble to examine whether they be  true  or  false  But a DEFECT in the of MISSION the Ministers of the Gospel  invalidates  the  Sacraments    affects  the  Purity  of all  Public Worship  and  is  therefore a  matter  which deserves  to be investigated  by every man who is sincerely a Christian  That it is  particularly  worthy of Investigation  at present  when the Church of England is assaulted on every side sometimes by  clamorous Invective  and sometimes by  insidious Stratagem  none of the children of  that  Church can  possibly doubt Her Faith  which we have  every Reason  to believe to be the  Faith which was once delivered to the Saints  is  undermined  by  Sophistry  and  vilified  by  Ridicule  Against  her Constitution  a thousand artful Cavils have been raised as if it were unfriendly to  civil  and  religious Liberty  and we have repeatedly been given to understand by men who  agree in nothing  but opposition to  us  that it would be expedient for the Legislature to abolish her HIERARCHY and to establish in its stead the  ecclesiastical Government  which prevails among the  Presbyterians    or Independents  or any other  novel Sect  which  Fancy  fertile of innovations might  readily  suggest  The  Faith  hath found  many  and  able  Defenders  who with  the Sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God  have  completely routed  that confederate Host which with the spirit of  Gebal and Ammon and Amalek  of old hath lately appeared in Arms against the Divinity of our Lord and Saviour and the Redemption of the World But the  Constitution  of the Church whether it be thought that the Subject is of little Importance whilst her Faith is at Stake or for some other Reasonsuch as the dread of the popular Cry of High Church  On this part of my Subject I beg leave to refer the Reader to the excellent Charge delivered to the Clergy of the Diocese of St David's in the course of the Summer by their illustrious Diocesan  or Priestcraft hath not  for many years  attracted from those faithful Soldiers of Christ the  Attention  to which in my opinion it is  justly entitled  It seemed therefore that I could not employ myself with greater Propriety than by shewing as fully as the  Time usually allotted to these Exercises could permit That OUR ECCLESIASTICAL CONSTITUTION hath its FOUNDATION in the HOLY SCRIPTURES and in the UNIVERSAL PRACTICE of the PRIMITIVE CHURCH and that although our Bishops derive many civil immunities much of their worldly Dignity and perhaps their whole Revenues from the munificence of the Statethe AUTHORITY to which in my Text OBEDIENCE is required flows to them from ANOTHER SOURCE  The Supreme Powers in this Kingdom have in general approved themselves the nursing Fathers of our religious Establishment and we may appeal to the History of England for  Proof  that the Members of  that  Establishment have in return been remarkable for their  Loyalty  and  Attachment  to the  Constitution of their Country  whilst the  Sectaries  when they prevailed against the  Church  prevailed likewise  against the  State  and trampled  at once  upon the  Mitre  and the  Crown  This constitutional Loyalty let it be our Care always to maintain and to inculcate upon those among whom we  labour in the word and doctrine  From  us  it is due not merely by  Ties of Allegiance  but as a  Debt of Gratitude  to that Government by which we are protected and to a Sovereign who shines conspicuous among the Rulers of the Earth for his Piety and for every personal and royal Virtue and who is by  Inclination  as well as by  Title  a  Defender of the Faith  But whilst we acknowledge with all thankfulness that we are indebted for  our Establishment  to the Laws of  Man  let us never forget that the AUTHORITY by which we minister in holy Things cometh to us with the EPISCOPAL ORDER from CHRIST and his APOSTLES and that it is our bounden Duty to support THAT AUTHORITY and THAT ORDER against the attacks of  these  who like  wild Boars out of the wood wasted our vineyard  in the last Century who in their Zeal for a  purer  and  more thorough Reformation  broke down the carved work of the Church with Axes and Hammers  and who have lately given  pretty clear Intimations of their Readiness  if they be not restrained within the Limits of Toleration  to work the same work again  To a Toleration  As surely as  Persecution  is the  Mark of the Beast  so is  Toleration  the  Seal of the Living God  This then is our present boast and it is also our great protection Our national Church under a Toleration and a Test bids fair to promote the progress of true Religion useful Learning and legal Liberty to the latest TimesBut from what is said in this discourse of the  Law of Toleration  let me not be understood as if I could suppose or would insinuate that  this Law  has altered the  Nature  of  Schism  which is a  Separation  from a Church not because it is established but because it is scriptural in its Doctrineand apostolical in its governmentan episcopal Society not Sect of Christians requiring assent only to the doctrines of the Gospel as taught in the three venerable Creeds used in our LiturgyThe  Act of Toleration  has not by taking away all civil  punishment  from the  offender  altered the  nature  of the  offence  and rendered it an  harmless thing  or an  empty name  By no means  Schism  or a causeless Separation from the Episcopal Church of Christ remains  what it was  a crime deserving condign censure But of this Separation whether with or without cause there is no absolutely adequate Judge but that Power who can distinguish between a well and an ill informed Conscience Very justly therefore do we remit  this Question  to a higher Tribunal But this Lenity rather aggravates than mitigates the guilt of Schism wherever it shall be found hereafter to exist  Schism  let it then be remembered is no less a crime  now  than it was  when  Civil Authority blindly interfered to vindicate the honour of Religion from this unhappy Scandal  of their Worship  Christians of every Denomination have an indisputable Right  not only  by the  Laws of England  but by the  great original Law  of the  Creator  who hath constituted men's minds in  such  a manner as that on questions complicated and involved Uniformity of Opinion is sometimes hardly to be expected and who has at the same time made it the Duty of  every Man  after having been at the utmost pains to procure the best  information  to regulate his Conduct by his own Conviction of Truth and Rectitude  But if an established Religion be  necessary  to the Tranquility of a State which hath been repeatedly proved by arguments that have not  yet  been overthrown and if that Religion which  is  established hath likewise the BEST Evidence of being TRUE which if I mistake not is happily the Case in England it is  surely  the  Duty  of those who are the  Clergy  of the Establishment to point out its  various Excellencies  and it is as plainly the Duty of  those  who are its  legal Guardians  to prevent its  avowed Enemies  from intruding into Stations whence they might be able to assail it with weapons  very different  from  the  Sword of the Spirit  In all our Contests however with such as oppose themselves let  Scripture    History  and  Reason  be our  only Arms  for by these alone can our Fortress be  honourably  defended and it stands in need of  no other Defence  Let us never in our eagerness to support  the Cause of Truth injure the  equally important Cause  of  universal    tender    heaven directed Charity  towards all the Descendants of Adam Let us remember that the most  vigorous  mind is perhaps not  completely fortified  against the Power of Prejudice and that if others differ from  us  every Man in the Course of his Life hath differed from  himself  Let us therefore extend to Sectaries and Dissenters of every Denomination those Indulgences which when they were triumphant and the Church was in the Dust  we did not enjoy  and whilst Duty requires us to  expose  their  Errors  and to  repel  their  Encroachments  Let our Conduct convince such of them as are  open to Conviction  that we can  love the Men  whose  Principles we disapprove  FINIS
