 The NATURE of the KINGDOM or CHURCH of CHRIST  A SERMON PREACH'D before the KING AT THE Royal Chapel at St  James  's On SUNDAY  March    By the Right Reverend FATHER in GOD BENJAMIN Lord Bishop of BANGOR  Publish'd by His MAJESTY'S Special Command  LONDON Printed for JAMES KNAPTON at the  Crown  and TIMOTHY CHILDE at the  White Hart  in St  Paul  's ChurchYard MDCCXVII  St  John  xviii  Jesus answered My Kingdom is not of this World  _ONE of those great Effects which length of Time is seen to bring along with it is the Alteration of the Meaning annexed to certain Sounds The Signification of a Word well known and understood by Those who first made use of it is very insensibly varied by passing thrô many Mouths and by being taken and given by Multitudes in common Discourse till it often comes to stand for a Complication of Notions as distant from the original Intention of it nay as contradictory to it as Darkness  is to Light The Ignorance and Weakness of Some and the Passions and Bad Designs of Others are the great Instruments of this Evil which even when it seems to affect only indifferent Matters ought in reason to be opposed as it tends in it's nature to confound Men's Notions in weightier Points but when it hath once invaded the most Sacred and Important Subjects ought in Duty to be resisted with a more open and undisguised Zeal as what toucheth the very Vitals of all that is good and is just going to take from Men's Eyes the Boundaries of Right and Wrong  The only Cure for this  Evil  in Cases of so great Concern is to have recourse to the Originals of Things to the Law of Reason in those Points which can be traced back thither and to the Declarations of  Jesus Christ  and his immediate Followers in such Matters as took their Rise solely from those Declarations For the Case is plainly this that Words and Sounds have had such an Effect not upon the  Nature of Things which is unmoveable but upon the Minds of Men in thinking of them that the very same Word remaining which at first truly represented One certain Thing by having Multitudes of new inconsistent Ideas in every Age and every Year added to it becomes it self the greatest Hindrance to the true understanding of the Nature of the Thing first intended by it  For Instance  Religion  in St  James  's Days was Virtue and Integrity as to our selves and Charity and Beneficence to others before  God  even the  Father Ja  i By Degrees it is come to signify in most of the Countries throughout the whole World the Performance of every thing almost except Virtue and Charity and particularly a punctual Exactness in a Regard to particular  Times Places Forms  and  Modes  diversified according to the various Humours of Men recommended and practised under the avowed Name of  External Religion Two Words  which in the Sense fix'd upon them by many Christians  God hath put asunder  and  which therefore  no Man should join together  And accordingly the Notion of a  Religious Man  differs in every Country just as much as  Times Places Ceremonies Imaginary Austerities  and all other  Outward Circumstances  are different and various Whereas in truth thô a Man truly  Religious  in other Respects may make use of such Things yet they cannot be the least part of his  Religion  properly so call'd any more than his Food or his Raiment or any other Circumstance of his Life  Thus likewise the  Worship  of  God  to be paid by Christians was in  our Saviour's  time and in his own plain Words the Worship of the Father  in Spirit and Truth  and this declared to be one great End proposed in the  Christian Dispensation The Hour cometh and now is when the true Worshippers shall Worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth for the Father seeketh such to worship him  John iv But the  Notion  of it is become quite another thing and in many  Christian Countries  that which  still retains the Name of the  Worship  of  God  is indeed the Neglect and the Diminution of the Father and the Worship of other Beings besides and more than the  Father  And this performed in such a manner as that any  indifferent Spectator  would conclude that neither the Consciences nor Understandings of Men neither  Spirit  nor  Truth  were at all concerned in the Matter or rather that they had been banish'd from it by an express Command In the mean time the  Word  or  Sound  still remains the same in Discourse The whole Lump of indigested and inconsistent Notions and Practices Every thing that is solemnly said or done when the  Worship  of  God  is profess'd is equally cover'd under that  general Name  and by the help of using the same  Original Word  passeth easily for the  Thing  it self Again  Prayer  in all our  Lord  's Directions about it and particularly in that  Form  which He himself taught his Followers was a calm undisturbed  Address  to  God  under the Notion of  a  Father  expressing those Sentiments and Wishes before Him which every sincere Mind ought to have But the same  Word  by the help of Men and voluminous Rules of Art is come to signify  Heat  and  Flame  in such a manner and to such a degree that a Man may be in the  best Disposition  in the World and yet not be  devout  enough to  Pray  and many an honest Person hat been perplex'd by this Means with Doubts and Fears of being uncapable of  Praying  for want of an  intenseness  of  Heat  which hath no more relation to the Duty than a Man's being in a  Fever  hath to the Sincerity of his Professions or Addresses to any  Earthly Prince  Once more the  Love of God  and of  our Saviour  was at first in his own Words and those of St  John  many times repeated the  keeping his Commandments or doing his Will  Joh  ch  I Joh  ch  II  Joh  But the  Notion  of it was it seems left very jejune and so hath been improved  by his  later Followers  till the same  Name  still kept up in the Language of  Christians  is far removed from the  Thing  principally and first intended and is come by degrees to signify a violent  Passion Commotion  and  Ecstasy  venting it self in such sort of Expressions and Disorders as other  Passions  do and this regulated and defined by such a Variety of Imaginations that an ordinary  Christian  with the utmost Sincerity in his Heart is filled with nothing but eternal Suspicions Doubts and Perplexities whether he hath any thing of the true  Love  of  God  or not  I have mentioned these  Particulars  not only to shew the Evil it self and to how great a Degree the  Nature  of Things hath suffered in the Opinions of Men by the Alteration of the Sense of the same  Words  and  Sounds  but to give you Occasion to observe that there can be no Cure for it in  Christians  but to go back to the  New Testament  it self because  there  alone we shall find the Original Intention of such Words  or the Nature of the Things design'd to be signified by them declared and fixed by our  Lord  or his  Apostles  from him by some such Marks as may if we will attend to them guide and guard us in our Notions of those Matters in which we are most of all concern'd  It is with this View that I have chosen those  Words  in which our  Lord  himself declared the Nature of  his own Kingdom  This  Kingdom  of  Christ  is the same with the  Church  of  Christ  And the  Notion  of the  Church  of  Christ  which at first was only the Number small or great of Those who believed  Him  to be the  Messiah  or of Those who subjected themselves to  Him  as their  King  in the Affair of  Religion  having since that Time been so diversified by the various  Alterations  it hath undergone that it is almost impossible so much as to number up the many  inconsistent Images  that have come by daily Additions to be united together in it nothing I think can be more useful than to consider the same thing  under some other  Image  which hath not been so much used nor consequently so much defaced And since the  Image  of  His Kingdom  is  That  under which our Lord himself chose to represent it We may be sure that if we sincerely examine our Notion of his  Church  by what He saith of his  Kingdom  that  it is not of this World  we shall exclude out of it every thing that he would have excluded and then what remains will be true pure and uncorrupted And what I have to say in order to this will be comprehended under Two  General Heads  I As the  Church  of  Christ  is the  Kingdom of Christ He  himself is  King  and in this it is implied that  He  is himself the sole  Lawgiver  to his  Subjects  and himself the sole  Judge  of their  Behaviour  in the Affairs of  Conscience  and  Eternal Salvation  And in this Sense therefore  His Kingdom is not of this World  that He hath in those Points left behind Him no visible humane  Authority  no  Vicegerents  who can be said properly to supply his Place no  Interpreters  upon  whom his Subjects are absolutely to depend no  Judges  over the Consciences or Religion of his People For if this were so that any such absolute  Vicegerent Authority  either for the making  new Laws  or interpreting  Old  Ones or  judging  his  Subjects  in  Religious  Matters were lodged in any Men upon Earth the Consequence would be that what still retains the Name of the  Church  of  Christ  would not be the  Kingdom of Christ  but the  Kingdom  of those Men vested with such  Authority  For whoever hath such an  Authority  of making Laws is so far a  King  and whoever can add new Laws to those of  Christ  equally obligatory is as truly a  King  as  Christ  himself is Nay whoever hath an  absolute Authority  to  interpret  any written or spoken Laws it is  He  who is truly the  Lawgiver  to all Intents and Purposes and not the Person who first wrote or spoke them  In humane Society the  Interpretation  of  Laws  may of necessity be lodged in some Cases in the Hands of Those who were not originally  the  Legislators  But this is not  absolute  nor of bad Consequence to  Society  because the  Legislators  can resume the  Interpretation  into their own Hands as they are Witnesses to what passes in the World and as They can and will sensibly interpose in all those Cases in which their Interposition becomes necessary And therefore They are still properly the  Legislators  But it is otherwise in  Religion  or the  Kingdom  of  Christ  He himself never interposeth since his first Promulgation of his  Law  either to convey  Infallibility  to Such as pretend to handle it over again or to assert the true  Interpretation  of it amidst the various and contradictory Opinions of Men about it If  He  did certainly thus interpose He himself would still be the  Legislator  But as  He  doth not if such an absolute  Authority  be once lodged with Men under the Notion of  Interpreters They  then become the  Legislators  and not  Christ  and  They  rule in their own  Kingdom  and not in  His  It is the same thing as to Rewards and Punishments to carry forward the great End of his  Kingdom  If any Men upon Earth have a  Right  to add to the  Sanctions  of his  Laws  that is to increase the Number or alter the Nature of the  Rewards  and  Punishments  of his Subjects in Matters of Conscience or Salvation They are so far  Kings  in his stead and Reign in  their own  Kingdom and not in  His  So it is whenever They erect  Tribunals  and exercise a  Judgment  over the Consciences of Men and assume to Themselves the Determination of such Points as cannot be determined but by  One  who knows the Hearts or when They make any of their own Declarations or Decisions to concern and affect the State of Christ's Subjects with regard to the Favour of God this is so far the taking  Christ's Kingdom  out of  His  Hands and placing it in their own  Nor is this matter at all made better by their declaring Themselves to be  Vicegerents  or  Lawmakers  or  Judges  under  Christ  in order to carry on the Ends of his Kingdom For it comes to this at last since it doth not seem fit to Christ himself to interpose so as to prevent or remedy all their mistakes and contradictions that if They have this power of interpreting or adding Laws and judging Men in such a sense that  Christians  shall be indispensably and absolutely obliged to obey those  Laws  and to submit to those  Decisions  I say if They have this power lodged with them then the  Kingdom  in which They rule is not the Kingdom of  Christ  but of  Themselves    He  doth not rule in it but  They  And whether They happen to agree with Him or to differ from Him as long as They are the  Lawgivers  and  Judges  without any Interposition from  Christ  either to guide or correct their  Decisions They  are  Kings  of this  Kingdom  and not  Christ Jesus  If therefore the  Church  of  Christ  be the  Kingdom  of  Christ  it is essential to it That  Christ  himself  be the Sole  Lawgiver  and Sole  Judge  of his Subjects in all points relating to the favour or displeasure of  Almighty God  and that All His  Subjects  in what Station soever They may be are equally  Subjects  to  Him  and that No One of them any more than Another hath  Authority  either to make  New Laws  for  Christ's  Subjects or to impose a sense upon the  Old  Ones which is the same thing or to  Judge  Censure or Punish the Servants of  Another Master  in matters relating purely to  Conscience  or  Salvation  If any Person hath any other Notion either thro' a long Use of Words with Inconsistent Meanings or thro' a negligence of Thought let Him but ask Himself whether the  Church  of  Christ  be the Kingdom of  Christ  or not And if it be whether this Notion of it doth not absolutely exclude All other  Legislators  and  Judges  in matters relating to Conscience or the favour of God or whether it can be  His  Kingdom if any Mortal Men have such a Power of  Legislation  and  Judgment  in it This  Enquiry  will bring Us back to the first which is the only True Account of the  Church  of  Christ  or  the  Kingdom  of  Christ  in the mouth of a Christain That it is the Number of Men whether Small or Great whether Dispersed or united who truly and sincerely are Subjects to  Jesus Christ  alone as their  Lawgiver  and  Judge  in matters relating to the Favour of God and their  Eternal Salvation  II The next principal point is that if the  Church  be the  Kingdom  of  Christ  and this  Kingdom be not of this World  this must appear from the Nature and End of the  Laws  of Christ and of those Rewards and Punishments which are the  Sanctions  of his  Laws  Now his  Laws  are Declarations relating to the Favour of God in another State after this They are Declarations of those Conditions to be perform'd in this World on our part without which God will not make us Happy in that to come And they are almost All general Appeals to the  Will  of that God to his  Nature  known by the Common Reason of Mankind and to the imitation of that  Nature  which must be our  Perfection  The  Keeping his Commandments  is declared the  Way  to Life and  the  doing his Will  the Entrance into the  Kingdom of Heaven  The being  Subjects  to  Christ  is to this very End that We may the better and more effectually perform the  Will  of  God  The  Laws  of this  Kingdom  therefore as  Christ  left them have nothing of  this  World in their view no Tendency either to the Exaltation of  Some  in worldly pomp and dignity or to their absolute Dominion over the Faith and Religious conduct of  Others  of his Subjects or to the erecting of any sort of  Temporal Kingdom  under the Covert and Name of a  Spiritual  one  The  Sanctions  of  Christ's Law  are  Rewards  and  Punishments  But of what sort Not the Rewards of this World not the Offices or Glories of this State not the pains of  Prisons Banishments Fines  or any lesser and more  Moderate Penalties  nay not the much lesser  Negative Discouragements  that belong to  Humane Society He  was far from thinking that  These  could be the Instruments of such a  Perswasion  as He thought acceptable to God But as the  Great End of his  Kingdom  was to guide Men to Happiness after the short Images of it were over here below so He took his  Motives  from that place where His  Kingdom  first began and where it was at last to end from those  Rewards  and  Punishments  in a future State which had no relation to this World And to shew that his  Kingdom was not of this World  all the  Sanctions  which He thought fit to give to  His Laws  were  not of this World  at all  St  Paul  understood this so well that He gives an Account of His own Conduct and that of Others in the same Station in these words  Knowing the terrors of the Lord we perswade men  whereas in too many  Christian Countries  since his days if Some who profess to succeed  Him  were to give an Account of their own Conduct it must be in a quite contrary strain  Knowing the terrors of this World and having them in our power We do not perswade men but force their outward Profession against their inward Perswasion  Now wherever  this  is practis'd whether in a great degree or a small in  that  place there is so far a Change from a  Kingdom  which is  not of this world  to a  Kingdom  which  is of this world  As soon as ever you hear of any of the  Engines  of  this world  whether of the greater or the lesser sort you must immediately think that then and so far the  Kingdom of this world  takes place For if the very Essence of  God's  worship be Spirit and Truth If  Religion  be  Virtue  and  Charity  under the  Belief  of a Supreme Governour and Judge if True Real  Faith  cannot be the effect of  Force  and if there can be no  Reward  where there is no  Willing Choice  then in all or any of these Cases to apply Force or Flattery Worldly pleasure or pain is to act contrary to the Interests of True  Religion  as it is plainly opposite to the Maxims upon which  Christ  founded his Kingdom who chose the  Motives  which are  not of this world  to support a  Kingdom  which  is not of this world  And indeed it is too visible to be hid that  wherever the  Rewards  and  Punishments  are changed from future to present from the World to come to the World now in possession there the  Kingdom  founded by our  Saviour  is in the Nature of it so far changed that it is become in such a degree what He professed  His Kingdom was not  that is  of this world  of the same sort with other Common  Earthly  Kingdoms in which the  Rewards  are Worldly Honours Posts Offices Pomp Attendance Dominion and the Punishments are Prisons Fines Banishments Gallies and Racks or something Less of the same sort  If  these  can be the true supports of a  Kingdom  which is  not of this World  then Sincerity and Hypocrisy Religion and No Religion Force and Perswasion A Willing Choice and a Terrified Heart are become the same things Truth and Falshood stand in need of the same methods to propagate and support them and our  Saviour  himself was little acquainted with  the  Right  way of increasing the Number of such  Subjects  as He wished for If He had but at first enlighten'd the  Powers  of  this World  as He did St  Paul  and employed the  Sword  which They bore and the  Favours  They had in their hands to bring  Subjects  into his  Kingdom  this had been an Expeditious and an effectual way according to the Conduct of some of his professed Followers to have had a Glorious and Extensive  Kingdom  or  Church  But this was not his Design unless it could be compassed in quite a different way  And therefore when You see  Our Lord  in  his  methods so far removed from Those of Many of his Disciples when You read Nothing in his Doctrine about his own  Kingdom  of taking in the Concerns of this World and mixing them with those of Eternity no Commands that the Frowns and Discouragements of this present State should in any Case attend upon Conscience and Religion No Rules against the Enquiry of All His Subjects into his  Original  Message  from Heaven no Orders for the kind and charitable force of  Penalties  or  Capital Punishments  to make Men think and chuse aright no Calling upon the  secular Arm  whenever the  Magistrate  should become  Christian  to inforce his Doctrines or to back his  Spiritual Authority  but on the contrary as plain a Declaration as a few Words can make that  His Kingdom is not of this World  I say when You see this from the whole Tenor of the  Gospel  so vastly opposite to Many who take his Name into their Mouths the Question with you ought to be Whether He did not know the Nature of his own  Kingdom  or  Church  better than Any since his Time whether you can suppose  He  left any such matters to be decided against  Himself  and his own Express professions and whether if an  Angel from Heaven  should give you any Account of his  Kingdom  contrary to what He himself hath done it can be of any Weight or Authority with Christians  I have now made some such observations  drawn from the  Church  being the  Kingdom  of  Christ  and not of any  Men  in that  Kingdom  from the  Nature  of his  Laws  and from those  Rewards  and  Punishments  which are the Sanctions of those Laws as lead us naturally into the true  Notion  of the  Church  or  Kingdom  of  Christ  by excluding out of it every  thing  inconsistent with  His  being  King Lawgiver  and  Judge  as well as with the Nature of His  Laws  and of His promises and Threatnings I will only make  Two  or  Three  Observations grounded upon this And so conclude And  From what hath been said it is very plain in general that the Grossest Mistakes in Judgment about the Nature of  Christ  s  Kingdom  or  Church  have arisen from hence that Men have argued from Other visible  Societies  and Other Visible  Kingdoms of this World  to what ought to be Visible and Sensible in  His Kingdom  Constantly leaving out of their  Notion  the most Essential Part of it that  Christ  is  King  in his own  Kingdom  forgetting this  King  himself because  He is not now seen by mortal Eyes and Substituting  Others  in his Place as  Lawgivers  and  Judges  in the same Points in which  He  must either  Alone  or not at all be  Lawgiver  and  Judge  not contented with such a  Kingdom  as He established and desires to reign in but urging and contending that  His Kingdom  must be like  Other Kingdoms  Whereas He hath positively warn'd them against any such Arguings by assuring Them that this  Kingdom  is  His Kingdom  and that it is  not of this World  and therefore that No  one  of  His Subjects  is  Lawgiver  and  Judge  over  Others  of them in matters relating to  Salvation  but  He  alone and that We must not Frame our Ideas from the  Kingdoms of this World  of what ought to be in a visible and sensible manner in  His Kingdom  From what hath been said it appears that the  Kingdom  of  Christ  which is the  Church  of  Christ  is the  Number  of Persons who are Sincerely and Willingly  Subjects  to  Him  as  Lawgiver  and  Judge  in all matters truly relating to  Conscience or Eternal Salvation And the more close and immediate this Regard to  Him  is the more certainly and the more evidently true it is that They are of his  Kingdom  This may appear fully to their own Satisfaction if They have recourse to  Him  himself in the  Gospel  if They think it a sufficient Authority that He hath declared the  Conditions  of their  Salvation  and that No Man upon Earth hath any Authority to declare any other or to add one tittle to them if They resolve to perform what They see He laith a stress upon and if They trust no mortal with the absolute direction of their  Consciences  the pardon of their Sins or the determining of their Interest in God's favour but wait for their  Judge  who alone can bring to light  the hidden things of darkness  If They feel themselves disposed and resolved to receive the Words of  Eternal Life  from  Himself  to take their  Faith  from what He himself  once delivered  who knew better than All the rest of the World what He required of his own  Subjects    to direct their  Worship  by his Rule and their whole practice by the General Law which He laid down If They feel themselves in this disposition They may be very certain that They are truly his  Subjects  and Members of his  Kingdom  Nor need They envy the Happiness of  Others  who may think it a much more evident Mark of their belonging to the  Kingdom  of  Christ  that They have  other  Lawgivers and Judges in  Christ  's  Religion  besides  Jesus Christ  that They have recourse not to  his own  Words but the Words of  Others  who profess to interpret them that They are ready to Submit to this  Interpretation  let it be what it will that They have set up to Themselves the  Idol  of an unintelligible  Authority  both in  Belief  and  Worship  and  Practice  in Words  under  Jesus Christ but in deed and in truth  over  Him as it removes the minds of his  Subjects  from  Himself  to Weak and passionate Men and as it claims the same Rule and Power in  his Kingdom  which He himself  alone  can have But  This will be  Another observation  that it evidently destroys the  Rule  and  Authority  of  Jesus Christ  as  King  to set up any Other  Authority  in  His Kingdom  to which His Subjects are indispensably and absolutely obliged to Submit their Consciences or their Conduct in what is properly called Religion There are  some  Professed Christians who contend openly for such an  Authority  as indispensably obliges All around Them to  Unity  of Profession that is to Profess even what They do not what They cannot believe to be true This sounds so grossly that  Others  who think They act a glorious part in opposing such an Enormity are very willing for their own sakes to retain such an  Authority  as shall oblige Men whatever They themselves think though not to profess what They do not believe yet to forbear the  profession  and  publication  of what They do believe let them believe it of never so great Importance  Both these  Pretensions  are founded upon the mistaken  Notion  of the  Peace  as well as  Authority  of the  Kingdom  that is the  Church  of  Christ  Which of them is the most insupportable to an honest and a Christian mind I am not able to say because They both equally found the  Authority  of the  Church  of  Christ  upon the ruines of Sincerity and Common Honesty and mistake  Stupidity  and  Sleep  for  Peace  because They would both equally have prevented  All Reformation  where it hath been and will for ever prevent it where it is not already and in a word because both equally devest  Jesus Christ  of his  Empire  in  his own  Kingdom set the obedience of his  Subjects  loose from  Himself  and teach them to prostitute their  Consciences  at the feet of  Others  who have no right in such a manner to trample upon them  The  Peace  of  Christ's Kingdom  is a manly and Reasonable  Peace  built upon Charity and Love and mutual forbearance and receiving one another as God receives us As for any other  Peace  founded upon a Submission of our  Honesty  as well as our  Understandings  it is falsely so  called It is not the  Peace  of the  Kingdom  of  Christ  but the  Lethargy  of it and a  Sleep unto Death  when his  Subjects  shall throw off their relation to  Him  fix their subjection to  Others  and even in Cases where They have a right to see and where They think They see his Will otherwise shall shut their Eyes and go blindfold at the Command of  Others  because those  Others  are not pleas'd with their Enquiries into the Will of their great Lord and Judge  To conclude The  Church of Christ  is the  Kingdom of Christ  He is  King  in his own Kingdom He is Sole  Lawgiver  to his Subjects and Sole  Judge  in matters relating to Salvation His  Laws  and  Sanctions  are plainly fixed and relate to the Favour of God and not at all to the Rewards or Penalties of  this World  All his Subjects are  equally  his Subjects and as such  equally  without Authority to alter to add to or to  interpret  his  Laws  so as to claim the absolute Submission of  Others  to such  Interpretation  And All are  His Subjects  and in his Kingdom  who are ruled and governed by  Him  Their  Faith  was  once  delivered by  Him  The Conditions of their Happiness were  once  laid down by  Him  The Nature of  God's Worship  was  once  declared by  Him  And it is easy to judge whether of the Two is most becoming a  Subject  of the  Kingdom  of  Christ  that is a  Member  of his  Church  to seek all these particulars in those plain and short Declarations of their  King  and  Lawgiver  himself or to hunt after Them thro' the infinite contradictions the numberless perplexities the endless disputes of  Weak Men  in several Ages till the Enquirer himself is lost in the Labyrinth and perhaps sits down in Despair or Infidelity If  Christ  be our  King  let us shew our selves  Subjects  to  Him  alone in the great affair of Conscience and Eternal Salvation and without fear of Man's judgment live and act as becomes Those who wait for the appearance of an Allknowing and Impartial Judge even  that King  whose  Kingdom is not of this World  FINIS
