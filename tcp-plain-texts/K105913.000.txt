 THE NOBLE PEASANT A COMIC OPERA IN THREE ACTS AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN THE HAYMARKET  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT  DUBLIN Printed by J EXSHAW for the COMPANY of BOOKSELLERS  M DCC LXXXIV  ADVERTISEMENT  FOR the ease and convenience of the Provincial Theatres as well as to gratify the Curiosity of the Reader those Passages and Songs which were omitted in the Representation are put between inverted Commas Scenes which often are tedious in the Theatre amuse in the Closet and it would perhaps be an experiment not much to the advantage of most Theatrical Productions to restore on any Stage Passages which without great Experience it would be difficult to give a reason why they should not be restored  The Fable relates to Times so remote that the task of supporting dialogue in which Wit is necessary and yet of not offending the manners of those Times is no easy one Glory is often acquired in proportion as impediments are overcome Far be it however from the Author to insinuate in what degree he is intitled to this kind of praise that Decision rests with the Public and it cannot be in hands more equitable  Ambitious of deriving Fame from a source whence Fame has so often flowed from Poetry the Author has paid an attention to the Songs which he hopes the Lovers of Poetry will approve Should they really possess Excellence it is still to be expected it must oftcn remain unnoticed The Poetical Beauties of the Songs in the Duenna are frequently overlooked but they are not therefore the less beautiful In some instances Poetry has here been obliged to give place to Situation and other Accidents and pretends to no Charms  To Mr Shield the Author of the Music every Praise every Respect is due The universal Admiration he has received on this as well as on various former occasions must give Pleasure to every ingenuous mind For who can forbear being happy at the prosperity of a Man whose Head and whose Heart are equally superior The NOBLE PEASANT owes much very much of its success to the Genius of the Musician The Airs not only possess Sweetness and Originality but they are learned likewise and what is far to be preferred they have Passion and Enthusiasm The very Accompaniments are full of these inestimable Qualities If Friendship be not more than partial the first Song in the third Act is in particular in all its Parts worthy of the greatest Master Harmony ever inspired  and yet to single out this Song only is doing great injustice to the rest There is little danger indeed in declaring such Opinions for every one declares the same  To all those whose Talents have contributed to the success of this Opera from the greatest to the least the Author returns his Thanks He forbears to recite Names because distinctions are difficult and because he cannot without an appearance of seeking to flatter mention them with all the Respect he wishes should he mention them at all  UPPER MARYLEBONESTREET  AUGUST  The Words of the

glee and after singing a part of it appear and finish it  Enter  Adam Bell Will Cloudeslee Clym o' the Clough  c dressed in the old  English  fashion with their bows and arrows swords c  GLEE  SMITH  COME my good fellows and quit the bower  The Sun no longer seems to lour  Your arrows bring your bows of yew  With silver tips and silken clue  And let the lusty bugle horn  Tell of the death of deer forlorn  With fatal note resounding  What tho' he be swift and bounding  The horn the horn the lusty horn  Shall tell the death of deer forlorn  Adam  Well said and well sung my merry hearts But where's Leonard Where's the valiant StriplingDoes he not draw a good bow Will What think'st thou Clym isn't he a child of valour  Clym  By my faith he's no Flincher  Will  It must be a hard crown that the Youngster can't crack  Clym  How furiously the rascal laid about him in the battle  Adam  I tell thee what Clymmercy forsake me if I would not rather encounter the sheriff and all his men than be obliged hand to hand to fight this Leonard  Will  By the Lord he has an arm like the claws of a Lion  Adam  Ay boy and he has a Lion's heart too Did you see in the fight how he brought down that termagant Dane that man of might that Alriche that seemed determined to kill every body himself How he died grinding the dust and cursing his heathen Gods to be so baffled by a Boy  Will  Yes and as if Leonard car'd little for such a victory he left another to take the spoil  Adam  Ay prithee Will who was that Knight that was so nimble at running away with the slain Alric's arms I had not seen him before in the battle  Will  Seen himNo nohe'll take care nobody shall see him in any dangercatch him there if you can'Twas Earl Egbert  Adam  Oh what the foolish Braggart that we have played pranks with him and his purse so often  Will  Ay heI saw his beaver upI could not mistake his unleavened face  Clym  But hark ye me boys tell me you that can what was the cause of this fray for tho' I have been fighting I hardly know what about  Adam  AboutAbout a pair of blue eyes two rosy cheeks some certain  of ivory teeth with  various  items  and  ceteras  all summed up in the word Woman  Clym  Explain explain  Adam  Why thusAnlaff the Dane meets upon a certain day with Edwitha the daughter of Earl Walter and is amazed at her beautyWell Sir finding▪ himself attacked by a terrible disease called sighing with dangerous symptoms he demands me this same Lady fair in marriage that he may be able to eat his beef as heretofore Earl Walter however did not chuse his daughter should be the Dane's doctor in this case  Clym  Why so  Adam  Why soZounds Clym hast no religionDost not know that these Redheads these Carrotypolesare Pagans  Clym  Damn it I had forgot that  Adam  My frecklefaced gentleman takes this denial in dudgeon and turning on his heel vows vengeanceNow neither Earl Walter nor his son Harold are of the cuckow breed they won't be pecked atso the issue of this no marriage was the battle in question  Will  And Anlaff instead of gaining a wise has lost his brother Alric  Clym  Ay and some few morewe left some on their backs that wont't be in a hurry to get up  Will  Well well they may call us Outlaws if they please but I say we are brave fellows and if not the most honourable we are at least as merry as our neighbours  SONG  WILL CLOUDESLEE  SHIELD  I  Beneath the worn rock or upon the shorn grass  Where pipes the blythe Lad or where trips the sweet Lass  By hawthorns that bloom or that bear the red berry  In hail rain or sunshine we are happy and merry  II  When clouds ride the mountains and winds rend the vales  When murrains and mildews the Shepherd bewails  If scanty our store let us share it with pleasure  The heart of the Brave is the chest of his treasure  Adam  But let me tell you my Hearts Harold may thank US for the victory That Anlaff and his Redheads and especially that Alric with his twohanded sword bestirred themselves so stoutly that by the Lord Lads Harold's men were little better than Runaways when we came to the field  Will  Well thenour assistance gained the battlewhat now shall be our reward  Clym  Hanging on the next tree if Earl Walter could catch us  Adam  Why truly my boys there are dangerous complaints gone abroad against us your fat Monks and your lean Usurers have taken exception at us Forresters and called us Freebootersfor which reason the King's pardon would be a good thing  Clym  But how are we to get it  Adam  Why I have a project  Will  AyWhat is it  Adam  I will go to the castle disguised like a FriarThere I shall learn what they say about the battle and whether they will be ready to thank us for the service we did them  Clym  Thank us why zounds they did not know it was us Did not we all go disguised  Adam  But we have tongues and they understand EnglishEarl Walter is a great man at court  Clym  But hark ye me Adam suppose you should be discovered and there should be any foul play  Adam  There is no danger I have a friend there in a cornerBesides I know how to a  my part I will sing them jovial songs tell them merry tales and forgive them all their sins and I warrant I shall be a favourite in the family  Clym  Nay I don't fear thee for thou art thoroughly instructed in the art and mystery of eating drinking and wenching and that is the trade of a Friar  Adam  However I intend to go armed  and sling my bugle horn across my shoulder do you watch round the skirts of the forest and in case of any accident I will wind the signal of good or ill success  But let Leonard know the scheme as soon as you see himhe has a true heart and will never forsake a good cause  Clym  Why to be sure he'll fightbut he has one bad fault  Adam  AyWhat is that  Clym  Too scrupulous"too conscientious"he would not let me rob the old miserly Abbot of Whitby the other daywe almost quarrelled about it  Adam  Oh he has not been long among us you knowhe'll mend  Will  Well success to your scheme  Omnes  Ayaysuccess to Friar Adam  SONG  ADAM BELL  SHIELD  I  We are Archers so stout and so good  With hearts unacquainted with fear  We live in the merry green wood  And feed on the King's fallow deer  We feed on the King's fallow deer  In spite of the Sheriff and law  We ne'er from the Poor draw a tear  But keep Monks and fat Abbots in awe  CHORUS  And so merry so merry live we  With hearts light as air  We are strangers to care  All under the green wood tree  II  For Archery England is fam'd  Expert are her sons at the bow  Their broad arrows often have tam'd  The rude insults and vaunts of the Foe  But England itself can't excel  For valour and good archery  Bold Clym o' the Clough Adam Bell  And William of Cloudeslee  CHORUS  And so merry so merry live we  With hearts light as air  We are strangers to care  All under the green wood tree  SCENE II  Changes to a beautiful valley with the prospect of a superb castle in the Gothic stile  Edwitha  and  Adela  Edw  Truly Adela I would be chearful but memory will not let me  I know as well as thou dost that sorrow will not cure a wound but knowing myself the cause of this unhappy broil the chearful spirits which health and active youth bestow are all dispersed by Fear and froward Apprehension  I am like a respited Criminal that every moment dreads a confirmation of his sentence  Ade  Pshaw Edwitha I declare you don't deserve your happiness There are hundreds of Ladies in little England that would give their brightest eye thus to have the gauntlet thrown and see themselves the happy subject of contention  when young and valiant Knights mount neighing Steeds and ride in bright and burnished armour to the fieldTo hear the winding of the Buglehorn the clattering of the Horses' hoofs and the prophetic buz of victory among the Warriors  Oh were I the beauteous Dame that could inspire such glorious strife I should  think of nothing but roses and lilies Venus and the  Gracestalk of nothing but Helen and Hector Greeks and Trojans  read nothing but ballads of beauteous Ladies and valorous Knights and sing 'em in my sleepshouldLord I should be so transported I don't know what I should do  Edw  This good cousin is said to divert mebut I know your heart Adelayou do not envy you pity meOh Harold Oh my brother would I were assured of thy safety  Edwitha  begins to sing  Responses are heard from the wood  Ye rocks and caves with deep resounding voice  Res  With deep resounding voice  Edwitha  and  Adela  are surprised  Edw  Did you hear Adela  Ade  Yes yes I heard  Edw  Once more  SONG  EDWITHA  SHIELD  Ye rocks and caves with deep resounding voice  Res  With deep resounding voice  Bid Echo who your haunts among  Can mimic well the Shepherd's song  Or Herdsman's hoarser throat  Res  Or Herdsman's hoarser throat  Or with the festive Villager rejoice  Can chirp to all the winged throng  Can oft repeat the jolly Ploughboy's song  Bid gentle Echo ease my grief  Res  Ease your grief  And tell me is my Harold safe  Res  Harold's safe  Edw  This is enchantment Adela 'Tis sure some kind Spirit sent to comfort me  Ade  I can't tell how kind he may be but I have discovered the Spirit Come come from your hiding place Mr and let us know what and who you are  Adela  goes toward a tuft of trees from whence  SCENE III  Enter  Leonard  with his flute  Edw  Was it you young Swain that with such respondent sweetness echoed me  Leo  Bows  Ade  Ha That's as much as to say yes  Mimics his modest bow  Edw  Such delightful melody in a poor Peasant is surely wonderful  Leo  Bows again and shakes his head  Ade  Oh hoThat's as much as to sayNo  Mimicking  Come come young man don't be over modestIf heaven has given you good gifts hold up your head and own it  Edw  But tell me trulyDo you know any thing of my brother's fateIs heis he safe  Leo  He is  Bows  Edw  Then I am happy  Ade  Therethere nowDidn't I tell you so  Edw  And is he victorious Is Anlaff vanquished  Leo  He is  Edwitha  turns away as if to suppress the joy that overpowers her  Ade  There thereDidn't I tell you that too Didn't I bid you dance and sing andHere young manhere is something for your good news  Offers him money  Leo  Bows and refuses it  Thank you Lady I am overpaid already  Ade  Gadamercy Aye indeed How so  Leo  By being a welcome messenger to such fair and gentle Ladies  Ade  HeydayA Peasant tooDo you mind this Edwitha This silly fellow refuses money and talksI don't know how  Edw  Tell me young Swain where you learnt these happy tidings I  it from report you speak or were you at the battle  Leo  I was at the battle  Ade  Were you Oh for heaven's sake give us a description of it  Leo  How shall a simple Peasant Lady speak of such high deeds Besides I saw but little of the combat  Edw  Perhaps you joined the Combatants and fought  Leo  Bows  Ade  Upon my word Mr Young man you are a very extraordinary kind of a personWhat is your name  Leo  Leonard  Ade  Andhow many Danes might you kill yourself  Leo  To speak of my own exploits were to undo with my tongue what I had atchieved with my arm I and my companions came not to the field till it was late the battle was hot and then I fought among the rest  Edw  Companions And did you go to fight for Harold and Edwitha  Leo  For Harold and Edwitha  Bows  Edw  "What shall I say" How shall I thank you But come come young Swain to the castle and my father Earl Walter shall bestow rewards equal I hope to your deserts  Leo  The rewards I sought are already bestowedHarold is victorious and Edwitha condescends to approve  Sighs  Ade  A sigh too Observe his eyes Edwitha  If you give him any further encouragement he'll make love to you  Well really he is a very likely fellow What a pity it is he is a Peasant Edwitha  Edw  It is indeed Adela  Sighs  Ade  It is indeed Adela  Mimicks her  So so sigh for sigh  Why Don Cupid seems disposed to make a pretty piece of work here  Aside  Come Edwitha it is time to be gone I seeWill you walkFare you well young man fare you wellEdwitha is very much obliged to youShe seems inclined  to like the colour of your hair toobut that the Fates and Destinies forbid  significantly  And so youyou must return home again and comfort pretty Nancy or pretty Peggy orsome other neat little linseywoolsey lassand you'll sing and play and tell 'em a pretty taleI warrant they'll listenAnd do you hear don'tdon't you be silly and dream either of Paradise or Purgatory but eat your curds and cream and honour your father and mother after your old fashionYou understand meContent is better than a downbed and the stars will be obeyed  There is many a precious stone trod under footEvery Hero can't be Alexanderbut these things can't be helpedSo farewell to youCome come Edwitha  Edw  Take this ring young Swain wear it in remembrance of EdwithaCome AdelaHeaven protect you Sir and make you victorious in battle and fortunate in love  Leo  Thanks gentle Lady sweet Lady from my heart dear Lady I thank youAnd while one drop of blood shall cherish this poor bosom will wear with thankfulness your favourand so farewell  Exit  Leonard  SCENE IV  Adela  and  Edwitha  Ade  Well really there is something very uncommon about this young manA rustic dignitya conscious kind of humble superioritya firm stepa steady eyea bold frontYes the Warrior's character is absolutely stampt upon his forehead  Edw  And that is surely magnanimity  Ade  So have I been told girl  RONDEAU  ADELA  SHIELD  The Hero conscious of his worth  Amid tumultuous war sedate  Arms Rage and Danger sends them forth  And seems to give decrees to Fate  When Trumpets in the deafen'd ear  With brazen throat and warlike breath  Would drown the trembling voice of Fear  And bid the Coward look on death  The Hero conscious of his worth  Amid tumultuous war sedate  Arms Rage and Danger sends them forth  And seems to give decrees to Fate  Edw  Oh Leonard Wherefore should such a mind be called ignobleUngenerous and unjust  Ade  But how now Edwitha Why surely girl you have more wit more pride than positively to love this Peasant I can see the fellow has a handsome leg as well as youcan read the modest preeminence of his eye as quick  can construe all his latent virtues as truly  What of thatI cannot purchase every trinket I see and there are many that if I had them I could not wear becausethey are  unfashionable  Edw  More is the pity that modesty courage and virtue should be out of fashion  Ade  Very true  but this has been a pitiable subject ever since Adam wore a beardConsider Edwitha the respect due to yourself your father and your  Edw  Nay Adela prithee do not mistake me so widelyThough I can see and cannot but admire in a poor Peasant those exalted virtues which first made men noble yet I know my duty I must worship nobility in its titles and its outward honours for so the freejudging world and the haughty pride of lineal dignity demandand I obeyThough my heart may lament its destiny it never shall reproach me  Ade  "Why that's my brave girl"And yet methinks there is something exceedingly remantic in this sudden way of falling in love at first sight  Edw  Nay Adela if it even were love it is not at first sight  Ade  No indeedAha What you are old acquaintances then  Edw  We never spoke till now but lately he hath often crossed my way run before me to "open gates" chace the browzing ox and remove the straggling bramble from my path seeking to be noticed yet avoiding to be thanked Once too he hung a garland on a stile over which I was to pass  Ade  Audacity"An enterprizing Gentleman truly"But you did not touch his garland  Edw  NoI turned suddenly back to the castle  Ade  You did rightCome come think of these things but as a dream remember the victory of your brother and smile at trifles  DUET  EDWITHA  and  ADELA  RAUZZINI  Virtue bids us conquer passion  Hard the victory we obtain  Hard to vanquish inclination  But the pleasure pays the pain  If a moment Virtue waver  She restor'd to former peace  Proud that Vice could not enslave her  Feels her energy increase  Exeunt  SCENE V  changes to the inside of the Castle  Enter  Adam Bell  in a Friar's habit followed by the  Fool

When the cottage chimney smokes  And waggish letchers crack their jok es  By the glowing ember's light  And fright the girls with tale of Sprite  Then will we o'er ale and cakes  Brag of feats at Autumn wakes  SPRING II  When the swallows twittering sing  Of the lovely birth of Spring  When Bridegrooms make our three bells ring  Ding dong dingding dong ding  When the Valley's face is seen  Veil'd in many a shade of green  When girls of husbands nightly dream  And jolly swains get clouted cream  Then we upon sweet primrose beds  Will rant our glees and rest our heads  SUMMER III  When the young frog sears the rook  When the kine stand in the brook  When sleepy louts lose many a crook  And codlings drop when trees are shook  When salt mushrooms nightly spring  And martins dip the dappled wing  When the sun with straitdown beam  Lathers well the lusty team  Then beneath new hayricks we  Will sing with might and merry glee  AUTUMN IV  When the sickle and the scythe  Make the ruddy Farmer blythe  When Hodge the bulky sheaf doth writhe  And the fat Vicar claims his tythe  When Autumn yields her golden store  Till wellfill'd barns can hold no more  When ripe fruits press the plenteous board  And old wives cull their wintry hoard  Then will we when labour's o'er  At harvesthome our catches roar  Adam  Though a Friar wenches this is my maximsummer or winter spring or fall I
