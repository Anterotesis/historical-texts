MAJESTY'S SERVANTS  By Mr  PHILIPS  LONDON  Printed for B LINTOT between the  Temp  Gates  in  Fleetstreet  MDCCXXII  To the Right Honourable the COUNTESS COWPER  _WHILE my Lord  Cowper  's Thoughts are intent as they have been many Years on  the Good of his Countrey I know Your Ladyship delights in Reading as often as the Care of Your Family and the Ceremonies of Life allow You Leisure for an Amusement too Elegant to become Fashionable The Two young Ladies likewise emulating the Accomplishments of their Mother are sensible of the Advantages arising from  the early Use of Books which give such a Bloom to the Mind as the Prime of Beauty discloses in the Features Had I therefore been able to make this Tragedy which I humbly request may appear under Your Ladyship's Protection as Compleat as it is Innocent It might have proved a lasting Testimony of my sincerest Acknowledgments  for such Obligations as I can never forget nor disown  I have had the Honour though I live concealed in the utmost Privacy of Life long to enjoy Your Ladyship's Favour If You are pleased to pardon this publick Declaration of my Gratitude what has been the secret Boast of my Heart will  henceforward turn to my greatest Reputation  I am With the greatest Respect  MADAM  Your  LADYSHIP'S  most Obliged most Humble and most Obedient Servant Ambr Philips  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr WILKS  VErtues and Vices are to Realms confin'd  And Climates give a Tincture to the Mind  Still This or That Peculiar Inclination  Remains Unalter'dand denotes a Nation  Thus Rivers flow thus Mountains ever stand  The Marks through every Age of every Land  Britons  you'll see when  Vanoc  comes before yee  The Love of Freedom is your ancient Glory  The  Romans  first this Native Vertue broke  Made us Politeand bow'd us to the Yoke  The  Saxons  then Unpolish'dgreatly Rude  Strangers to Luxuryand Servitude  Reviv'd the  British  Manliness of Soul  That spurns at Tyranny nor brookes Controul  In Time another Set of  Romans  came  And brought worse SlaveryThough they chang'd the Name  Tamed us with Luxuries of a different Kind  And made plain Truth distasteful to the Mind  By  Nassaw  's Aid at last we drive Them hence  And once again return to  common Sense  In  Britain  ever may It keep Possession  Establish'd by the  Protestant Succession  Blest in a Prince whose hightraced Lineage springs  From the famed Race of our Old  Saxon  Kings  Our Zeal for Liberty we safely own  He makes it the firm Basis of his Throne  Remember then the Dangers you have past  And let your Earliest Virtuebe your Last  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs YOUNGER  WHAT Tragick Bustle in this  British  Play  ButI am told 'tis writ the  ancient Way  NayThat it is not  Modern  is plain Fact  There's not one  Simile  to close an Act  But let me seeWhat other Art is wanting  In Tragedy there ought to be some  Ranting  Something so Exquisiteso very Good  It cannot possibly be understood  But  Gwendolen's  hard Fate I censure most  The blooming PrincessFairas any Toast  Captive to  Valens Yvor  's promis'd Bride  Between Two bashful Knightsa Virgin died  Three Hours unblestwith an  Italian  pass'd  No warbling Lover could have been more chaste  Our keener Sportsmen would have seiz'd the Quarry  But thus it iswhen Men designto marry  Still harder FateIf  DruidSongs  be true  She mustfor everHer first Flame renew  Such monst'rous Constancy let  Heathen  Schools  InjoinWe  Christian  Maids are no such Fools  One Monthat mostwe can a Husband bear  There's not  Two HoneyMoons  in any Year  Then what a Brute is  Vanoc  What a Pother  How could she help it ifshe lov'd another  Poor  Cartismand  There's not a Mannow living  But would have seem'd at least far more forgiving  WhatNot connive at Oneor Twoor Three  Well  Britain  never till of late was Free  How would his  British  Blood be set a madding  Had he in  Masquerades  beheld her gadding  But why does  Vellocad  not once appear  He was a pretty Fellowyou may swear  And what though  Vanoc  says  He could not fight  Is that the Way to do a Lady Right  Since those rude Times  Husbands  are more discreet  And know their  Cue  to wink at  what is meet  Then take us as we are'Tis no great Matter  For Women will be frail while Men can flatter  The Persons of the Play  MEN  Didius  the  Roman  General Mr  Thurmond  Valens  a  Roman  Tribune Mr  Mills  Vanoc  Prince

BRITON  ACT I SCENE I  SCENE the Pavilion of the General in the Roman Camp  Valens  and  Didius  VALENS  _HOW  Didius  shall a  Roman  sore repuls'd  Greet your Arrival to this distant Isle  How bid you Welcome to these shatter'd Legions  Did  Scarce had I scaped the Perils of the Deep  Thrown by a Tempest on the Rocky Coast  Ere the unwelcome News of your Defeat  Had reach'd my EarsBut  Valens  bear a Heart  Remember still the  Roman  Vertue scorns  A cheap Renown a Triumph without Toil  Val  Such easy Purchase here you shall not find  The brave  Ostorius  our late General  In War experienced to Fatigues inur'd  Impair'd by Wounds and the slow waste of Years  Despairing to subdue these hardy  Britons  Died with his Laurels blasted on his Brow  Did  No sooner was his Death to  Rome  convey'd  Than I petition'd to command in  Britain  Claudius  approv'd my Zeal and bade me speed  To tame  Barbarians  and assert his Empire  Val  May  Jove  the Guardian of the  Capitol  He the great  Stayer  of our Troops in Rout  Fulfill your Hopes and animate the Cohorts  Did  At  Rome  indeed the  Britons  are allow'd  To dare in Warperhaps even more than  Romans  And  Caradoc  their captive Chief was prais'd  As a rough Warriour of undaunted Boldness  Val  Oh  Didius  had you prov'd their martial Rage  The desperate Fury of their wild Assault  Not  Scythians  not fierce  Dacians  onward rush  With half the SpeedNor half so swift retreat  In Chariots fang'd with Scythes they scour the Field  Drive through our wedged Batalions with a Whirl  And strew a dreadful Harvest on the Plain  Did  But Conduct overcomes the forward Foe  And  Fabius  under Disappointments patient  Taught  Romans  first to conquer by Delay  Now to the Business  Valens  Since from you  As foremost Tribune of the Soldiers here  Do I your General expect my Knowledge  Instruct me whence this Uproar through the Land  And wherefore  Vanoc  the sworn Friend to  Rome  For so our Emperour esteem'd this Prince  Why he should spurn against our Rule and stir  The Tributary Provinces to War  Val  You must have heard of  Cartismand    Did  You mean  The wealthy Queenour powerful Allie  Who gave up  Caradoc  Val  A Female Warriour  Queen of the  Brigantians  Her did  Vanoc  Prince of the  Cornavians  wedA Contract  More in Ambition founded than in Love  While this Alliance held we stood secure  But  Cartismand  missled by fond Desire  Provokes a Husband jealous of his Honour  Unable longer to conceal her Flame  And fearing Vengeance gathering to a Storm  She crowns her Lover Takes him to her Bed  By solemn Nuptials And defying  Vanoc  Attempts by War to vindicate her Choice  Did  But how are We concern'd in this Debate  This private Jar  Val  I hasten to the Point  One BattleYesa Skirmish more there was  With adverse Fortune fought by  Cartismand  Her Subjects most revoltDistress'd pursued  She begs Protection from the  Roman  Arms  And vows perpetual Homage for the Service  Ostorius  interposedNo Terms of Peace  Would satisfy the ConquerourThen we  To balance  Vanoc  's Power receive the Queen  And aid her to sustain unequal War  Did  And can we not intreat this angry Prince  Val  Oh that you mightyet old  Ostorius  fail'd  Did  By Promises suspend his Rage a while  Val  What Offers would he not reject from  Romans  Did you but know himI have known him long  You would not wish to count this Man a Foe  In Friendship and in Hatred obstinate  Provok'd with Ease as hard to reconcile  In Justice rigid in Resentment warm  Punctual alike to punish or reward  A wilful hastyBut a gallant  Briton  Did  Such  Hannibal  appear'dYet  Hannibal  Was overthrownImpatient  Hannibal  But Tribune who approaches our Pavilion  Behold a Glare of Light shines through the Dusk  This way it moves  Val  The  British  Queen  Did  Our Part  It was in Courtesy to be the foremost  The best Amends will be that I receive  This Interview in private  Valens  anon  We must have farther Talk  SCENE II  Didius Cartismand  Did  Madam I blush  That you should thus anticipate my Purpose  Cart  Alas a Woman overborn by Wrongs  A Queen reduced to supplicate Relief  Lays all the Pride of Majesty aside  Humbles her Thoughts and stoops to her Condition  Did  But Greatness in Distress claims most Respect  An awful Pity in a  Roman  Breast  Cart  If royal Lineage if distinguish'd Blood  Down from an ancient Race of potent Kings  Now treasur'd in my VeinsNow boiling high  With Injurieswith Outragesthat burn  That set the very suffering Soul on Fire  Oh GeneralExcuse this Burst of Tears  Did  Princess asswage this Vehemence of Anguish  I come ambitious to support your Cause  Cart  My CauseIt is the Cause of  Rome  should  That unforgiving  Vanoc  once prevail  Vanoc  The  Roman  Name is lostThis bold Attempt  Shakes the Foundations of your Master's Empire  If  Britons  with Impunity rebell  Will other Nations not renounce his Sway  What Leagues will not be form'dIf his Allies  Are known to sufferas it will be known  His most avow'd AlliesWhat suppliant Prince  Shall sue to  Claudius  for a vain Protection  Who dread his Enmity  Did  Dismiss your Fears  Rome  will uphold her FriendsIn such a Cause  She neither counts her Blood or Treasure lavish'd  Not to recal in other Lands Exploits  That signalize our FaithYour Ancestor  I think his Name was  Mandubrace  who fled  To  Gaul  imploring Aid from  Caesar  Was to his Realm by  Caesar  's Arms restor'd  When last he enterpriz'd on this new World  Cart  Still may you prove the Terror of your Foes  The Bulwark of your firm Allies And stillâ–ª  Teach Traitors to repent of faithless Leagues  My Faith you cannot doubtWitness  Caradoc    Oh that like him proud  Vanoc  were my Spoil  To give to  Claudius  yet one Triumph more  A Tributary Crown with him I love  With  Vellocad  who best deserves my Love  Is all I ask to recompence my Faith  He is my LordThe chosen of my Heart  The Man who sympathiz'd in all my Sufferings  The Man who brav'd the Tyrant's jealous Rage  Who eas'd me of a Yoke too rude to bear  With him I vow'd to livewith him to die  This  Didius  is the whole of my Ambition  Did  Your Injuries had you a while dissembled  Cart  That is an Art we  Britons  are to learn  Divided from those Climes where Art prevails  Undisciplin'd by Precepts of the Wise  Our inborn Passions will not brook Controul  We follow Nature in her strong Desires  Our Joys our Griefs our Pleasures and our Pains  Alike sincere admit of no Disguise  Our Words declare our very Looks betray  The Feelings of the Soul the Workings of the Heart  Still happy or still wretched in Excess  Did  We  Romans  should prefer the Golden Mean  And choose to steer through Life with gentle Gales  Cart  We too would choose did Nature give us Choice  But Sir I should inform you now our Hopes  From their low Ebb begin to riseYour Presence  Not granted yet untimely will inspire  New Courage and retrieve what  Valens  lost  Already do the Soldiers in your Name  From Tent to Tent each animate his Fellow  And promise Vengeance to the hoary Shade  Of brave  Ostorius  Did  Just to his Renown  The Senate had decreed not so the Gods  To cheer his Age to sooth his long Fatigues  And close his restless Warfare in a Triumph  Cart  His Memory now committed to your Care  Be greatly Pious to the Worthy dead  Nor shall you want Assistance  Did  Generous Queen  His Ashes be my Trust In a strange Land  His  Manes  shall not wander unappeas'd  Cart  Too long already Vengeance is delay'd  Oh give the Spirit of  Ostorius  Rest  The Spoils of  Vanoc  he demandsfrom you  Vanoc  alone can furnish out his Trophy  Vanoc  whose Breach of Faith and foul Rebellion  Opprest the Aged with a Weight of Sorrow  Did  So all yee Powers propitious prove to me  As I avenge this much dishonour'd Shade  Cart  Soon shall you stand acquitted of your Vow  This NightThis instant Hour my  Vellocad  To whom your Emperour's Glory is most dear  Comes with AuxiliariesHence far Northward  A swarm of  Caledonians  hugelimb'd Warriours  Who wield with sinewy Arm a deadly Sword  And fight secure behind the sevenfold Target  Did  But how may  Vellocad  conceal their March  Or need we send out Forces to protect them  Cart  This woody Forest that divides the Camps  A Length of Shelter covers their Approach  Mean time the vain Usurper in my Palace  Prepares his Daughter's Nuptials nor suspects  These distant AidsBut  Didius  we shall call  The Bridegroom forthbefore the appointed Hour  Did  And pacify the slaughter'd Sons of  Rome  Cart  And blot the Name of  Vanoc  out of Life  His Brother died my PrisonerNor shall Himself  Nor shall his  Gwendolen  his Daughter dear  Survive to lengthen out his hated Race  And nurse a Brood of Traitors in my Realms  But see where  Idwall  speedsA trusty Soldier  A loyal Subjectnot unknown to  Valensâ–ª  SCENE III  Didius Cartismand Idwall  Id  Madam the bidden Guests are comeThey wait  Impatient to salute their General  Cart  Your Captains SirWithin my humble Tent  They waitThe good  Ostorius  often deigned  To grace my slender Table with his Presence  There shall you find your Friends with truest Welcome  To such coarse Fare as this rude Land affords  Did  Still Princess you outgo my Courtesy  Cart  Ere half the Night shall waste my absent Lord Will bid you Welcome  Did  I should speak to  Valens  Cart  Idwall  do you expect him hereHe too  Must be our GuestIntreat him not to fail  Did  By the Result of what your Queen imparts  I shall have Orders for himof Importance  Let him not fail me  Idwall  Cart  Let him bringâ–ª  The Map  Ostorius  tracedIt shews his Marches  His several Camps and Posture of the Island  Did  A Care well worthy of a  Roman  Soldier  Now Madam I attend you  Cart  This Way Sir  Behold the Moon shines on the pearly Dews  And through the Night directs the advancing Troops  SCENE IV  Idwall  Prompted at once by Vengeance and by Love  What will not Woman dareO  Cartismand  Adventurous PrincessBoldness be thy Praise  Thy Refuge now Thy Title to the Crown  No cool Advice no Caution will avail  Rashness is Prudence in a desperate Cause  The Sword alone can justify thy Passion  If in good Plight these Northern  Kerns  arrive  Then  Vellocad  does Fortune promise fair  And give at least one trying Battle more  This is the utmost Effort of thy Queen  Her last surviving HopeIf we succeed  And yet while this highmettled  Vanoc  lives  The  Romans  never shall have Peace in  Britain  Nor  Cartismand  be rescued from Alarms  SCENE V  Idwall Valens  Id  Valens  you come in Time  Val  In search of you  Have I employ'd my Absence  Id  The General  Is the Queen's GuestNor are you uninvited  I was enjoin'd to wait and bring you to them  They wanta Map  Val  The Draught  Ostorius  made  Id  The same  Val  This very Parchment RollWhereby  I meant to point the Countrey out  Id  You hear  The  Caledonian  Succours are at Hand  Val  Within some Furlongs of the Forest's Shelter  Id  Your new Commander need not pine for Action  Before to Morrow's Sun shall gain the Pitch  Of Noon we may controul the Pride of  Vanoc  Restore the Queen retrieve your late Defeat  And turn their purpos'd Revels into Mourning  Then  Valens  shall fair  Gwendolen  be thine  Thy Captive Prize the Servant of thy Will  And satisfy the Longings of thy Soul  Val  Thou  Idwall  dost not know how  Valens  loves  Nor feel the Power of such excelling Beauty  I would not triumph over  Gwendolen  Nor make her mine against her free Consent  There was a Time before her injur'd Sire  Declar'd perpetual Enmity to  Rome  A Time there waswhen  Valens  lov'd in Hope  But tho' my Hopes are fledmy Love remains  No  Idwall  noThe Princess must be happy  Or I be doubly wretched in her Sufferings  Id  But I would urge the Mischiefs to ensue  Should this Alliance be confirm'd by Marriage  Consider  Valens    Val  I foresee the Ruin  I know that  Yvor  the  Silurian  Prince  Who wedswho meritsBut I merit too  If Services if Faith if Love can merit  A Love so pure Debas'd by no Alloy  A Passion that pursues no other Bliss  Save the Felicity of Her I love  Only I wish fair  Gwendolen  might find  Oh Heavens that fond Felicity in me  She is my ClaimHer Father's Promises  Have made her mine Nor have I forfeited  Nor will I ever forfeit  Gwendolen  A Friend accounted long I felt her Charms  When  Yvor  was a Stranger to her Thoughts  When  Vanoc  had not yet espous'd your Queen  And she then Heiress to no large Dominion  Might not disdain to wed a  Roman  Tribune  Id  Still I remind you of the growing Power  That threatens us that threatens you in  Yvor  Val  I know he rules an untam'd Mountain Race  A Nation walled on every Side with Rocks  A fiery People desperate Foes to  Rome  Whom Dangers only kindle into Rage  I know this strict Alliance sought by  Vanoc  Unites three bordering Nations in his Cause  Id  The  Brigants  the  Cornavians  the  Silurians  Nor will the  Trinobants  your old Allies  Your Tributaries be enabled long  To stand against this formidable Union  Vain is your Triumph over  Caradoc  If this  Cornavian  a more vengeful Foe  Surpasses him in Power as much as Will  Val  Now  Didius  governs here to him belongs  The Conduct of the WarLet him command  And I obeyThis  Idwall  is my Duty  And yet I grieve at this untoward Quarrel  For  Rome  and for my self I grieveAnd wish  We had at least a fairer Shew of Justice  Id  An idle Wish Princes and States you know  Approve their Actions by SuccessNor you  Nor we have other HopeThe Contest  Valens  Is now not who shall reign but who shall live  And whether if the Queen be overthrown  The  Romans  shall be mark'd for Slaves in  Britain  Or perish by the  Druids  Hands in Flames  And give their Entrails to the searching Knife  A Message from the Queen  SCENE VI  Idwall Valens a Messenger  Id  We come Centurion  Val  He bears some earnest Purpose in his Looks  Mess  The Queen is apprehensive for the Succours  A Scout informs her that the Enemy  Prepare an AmbushA Body far advanced  Marches in Silence close behind the Wood  He takes them for  Silurians    Yvor  's Men  Id  We come this Instant  SCENE VII  Idwall Valens  Id  This restless Vigilance  This active Soul of  Vanoc  will undo us  Val  Come  Idwall  Now my Heart revivesâ–ª And I  Take Courage from DespairIf  Yvor  leads  This Enterprize Then  Didius  send Me forth  To meet my RivalEre the Dawn appears  Or He or I may fall  Id  Now is your Time  To save the  Romans  and to win the Fair  Should you succeedTho'  Gwendolen  a while  May grieveYet Womens Grief is transient  And they soon learn to love the Fortunate  Val  O  Venus  Parent of the  Roman  Line  Delight of Gods the Luxury of Men  Attend my VowAs in the  Cyprian  Isle  In  Britain  will I make thy Worship known  Accept my Piety to raise thy Shrine  And in return let  Gwendolen  be mine  End of the first Act  ACT II SCENE I  SCENE A Hall in the Palace of Vanoc  Vanoc  alone  ABove the Mountain Tops the ruddy Sun  Breaks through the Mists and dims the Moon  Ere now  Has  Yvor  try'd these Northern BladesAnd yet  By busy Thought is doubtful of the Event  His Life would be too dear a Price for Conquest  Since my lov'd Daughter Darling of my Soul  Will claim that LifeOh  Gwendolen  my

that  Didius  chose out me  To greet a Prince in my Esteem the foremost  Van  So much for WordsNow to your Purpose Tribune  Val  Sent by our new Lieutenant who in  Rome  And since from me has heard of your Renown  I come to offer Peace To reconcile  Past Enmities to strike perpetual Leagues  With  Vanoc  Whom our Emperor invites  To Terms of Friendship strictest Bonds of Union  Van  We must not hold a Friendship with the  Romans  Val  Why must you not  Van  Vertue forbids it  Val  Once  You thought our Friendship was your greatest Glory  Van  I thought you honestI have been deceiv'd  Would you deceive me twice No Tribune no  You sought for WarMaintain it as you may  Val  Believe me Prince your Vehemence of Spirit  Prone ever to Extremes betrays your Judgment  Would you once cooly reason on our Conduct  Van  Oh I have scann'd it thoroughNight and Day  I think it over And I think it base  Most infamousLet who will judgebut  Romans  Did not my Wife did not my menial Servant  Seducing each the other both conspire  Against my Crown against my Fame against my Life  Did they not levy War and wage Rebellion  And when I would assert my Right and Power  As King and Husband when I would chastise  Two most abandon'd Wretches Who but  Romans  Oppos'd my Justice and maintain'd their Crimes  Do I not reason cooly on your Conduct  You have the Art to gloss the foulest Cause  I shew it undisguis'dFor  Cartismand  The  Romans  stood The  Britons  and the Gods  Declar'd for  Vanoc  Do I argue fairly  Val  At first the  Romans  did not interpose  But griev'd to see their best Allies at Variance  Indeed when you turn'd Justice into Rigor  And even that Rigor was pursued with Fury  We undertook to mediate for the Queen  And hoped to moderate  Van  To moderate  What would you moderate My Indignation  The just Resentment of a vertuous Mind  To mediate for the QueenYou undertook  Wherein concern'd it You But as you love  To exercise your InsolenceAre you  To arbitrate my WrongsMust I ask leave  Must I be taught to govern o'er my Houshold  Am I then void of Reason and of Justice  When in my Family Offences rise  Shall Strangers saucy Intermeddlers say  Thus far and thus are you allow'd to punish  When I submit to such Indignities  When I am tamed to that Degree of Slavery  Make me a Citizen a Senator of  Rome  To watch to live upon the Smiles of  Claudius  To give my Wife my Children to his Pleasures  And sell my Countrey with my Voice for Bread  Val  Prince you insult upon this Day's Success  You may provoke too farBut I am cool  I give your Anger scope  Van  Who shall confine it  The  Romans  Let them rule their Slaves I blush  That dazzled in my Youth with Ostentation  The Trappings of the Men seduced my Vertue  Val  Blush rather that you are a Slave to Passion  Subservient to the Wildness of your Will  Which like a Whirlwind tears up all your Vertues  And gives you not the Leisure to consider  Did not the  Romans  civilize you  Van  No  They brought new Customs and new Vices over  Taught us more Arts than honest Men require  And gave us Wants that Nature never gave  Val  We found you naked  Van  And you found us free  Now on my Soul the Mountain Stag that springs  From Height to Height and bounds along the Plains  Nor has a Master to restrain his Course  That Mountain Stag would  Vanoc  rather be  Than be a SlaveMuch less the Slave of Slaves  Val  Would you be temperate once and hear me out  Van  Speak Thingsâ–ª that honest Men may hear with Temper  Speak the plain Truth and varnish not your Crimes  Say that you once were vertuousLong ago  A frugal hardy Peoplelike the  Britons  Before you grew thus elegant in Vice  And gave your Luxuries the Name of Vertues  The CivilizersThe Disturbers say  The Robbers the Corrupters of Mankind  Proud Vagabonds who make the World your Home  And lord it where you have no Right  Val  You wrong  Your Friends your Benefactors your Instructors  Since you will have the Truth I speak it out  Who but the  Romans  fashion'd your rude Natures  Smooth'd your rough Tempers Changed you into Men  From wild  Barbarians  Savages in Woods  Van  You changed us into Beasts most servile Beasts  To bear your Impositions your Dominion  Taught us indeed to cloath to dwell in Houses  To feast to sleep on Down to be profuse  A fine Exchange for LibertyWhat Vertue  Have you taught  Val  Humanity  Van  Oh Patience  Val  Can you disown a Truth confess'd by All  A Praise a Glory known in barbarous Climes  Far as our Legions march they carry Knowledge  The Arts the Laws the Discipline of Life  Our Conquests are Indulgencies and We  Not Masters but Protectours of Mankind  Van  Prevaricating falsemost courteous Tyrants  Romans  Rare Patterns of Humanity  Came you then here thus far through Waves to conquer  To waste to plunder out of mere Compassion  Is it Humanity that prompts you on  To ravage the whole Earth To burn destroy  To raise the Cries of Widows and of Orphans  To lead in Bonds the generous freeborn Princes  Who spurn who fight against your Tyranny  Happy for usand happy for you Spoilers  Had your Humanity ne'er reach'd our World  It is a Vertueso it seems you call it  A  Roman  Vertue that has cost you dear  And dearer shall it cost if  Vanoc  lives  Or if we die we shall leave those behind us  Who know the Worth of  British  Liberty  Val  I mean not to reproach your Ancestors  Untaught uncultivated as they were  Inhospitable full of Ferocity  Lions in Spirit cruel beyond Men  Your Altars reeking oft with human Blood  Nor will I urge you farther on our Merits  I come instructed Sir to offer Peace  The Peace that  Didius  offers  Valens  sues for  Propose your Terms and you will find me forward  To win the General to a Compliance  And to deserve once more the Name of Friend  Van  Deliver up the Queen send back my Daughter  This done we may be brought to treat of Peace  Val  Therein the Dignity the Faith of  Claudius  Would highly suffer  Van  Is then the Dignity  The Faith of  Claudius  founded on Injustice  Is it his Glory to protect a Traiteress  A base a profligate adulterous Woman  Fit Emperour indeed to govern  Romans    But  Valens  let me tell you the free  Britons  Would not endure his SwayThey must have Justice  And from their Prince do they require it most  Nay they demand it  Were I a Villager the meanest Freeman  In all your State and  Claudius  should presume  Or any  Caesar  to abuse his Power  And authorize enormous Crimes I would not  Nowere his Anger DeathI could not bear it  But would oppose him to my stretch of Power  Val  In blaming us in making your Demands  You do not recollect the Services  The Debt we owe to  Cartismand  Van  The Services the DebtNotorious Deed  Her earliest Infamy your worst Disgrace  Not recollect O  Caradoc  Thy Prowess  Not thy Credulity be my Example  Not know your ShameYes every  Briton  knows it  You triumph'd by a Woman's Perfidy  Ostorius  bought the Foe he could not conquer  Who else had conquer'd him and freed this Island  Val  Impetuous  Briton  Partial in your Rage  Van  The Fate of  Caradoc  and Shame of  Cartismand  Will ever be remembred through the Land  Did she not promise Aids Invite him to her  Receive him with adulterated Smiles  Then bind the brave believing Man in Chains  And barter with you for the Boast of  Britain  Yet this your Emperour vainly call'd a Triumph  And made a Spectacle of Vertue thus betray'd  Val  You need not thus employ your Eloquence  We know it all  Van  Yet let me recollect  Through the wide crowded Streets of  Rome  behold  The Warriour walk Majestick in his Bonds  In the full Senate now he stands undaunted  An aged awful a triumphant Captive  His Looks his Words appall the robed Assembly  And shake vainglorious  Claudius  on his Throne  Val  Claudius  took off his ChainsRemember that  Van  Then did your Nobles see a Man a  Briton  The Admiration the Terrour of the  Romans  This is the mighty Debt you owe that Woman  Val  Yet after this you married  Cartismand  Van  I was ambitiousThat I learn'd from You  That I did wed with Treachery and was a Friend  To  Romans  is the whole Reproach of  Vanoc  But they and she combin'd have clear'd my Honour  And when I stain it by forgiving Either  Let my own Subjects brand me for a Coward  Val  Talk not of Honour PrinceAn empty Sound  The Vaunting of a  Briton  in his Choler  To me at least you should have spar'd the Boast  You can renounce your Word we know at Pleasure  Forget past Services worn Marks of Kindness  Then quarrel with your Friends to free the Debt  And sacrifice all Faith to your Resentments  Van  This Accusation I can hear unmov'd  It sullies not my Soul nor taints my Fame  It is a Slander I expect no better  Val  Do I calumniate thenUngrateful  Vanoc    Perfidious PrinceIs it a Calumny  To say that  Gwendolen  betroth'd to  Yvor  Was by her Father first assur'd to  Valens  By solemn Promises you made her mine  And I by faithful Services deserv'd her  What have I done to merit this Injustice  Van  Then  Valens  was our Friend  Val  I never was  Your FoeUrge not that weak DefenseYou know  How much my Heart approv'd your Cause in secret  How I remonstrated against the War  How I abhorr'd the Conduct of the Queen  What did I not for youThrough my Persuasion  How often did  Ostorius  proffer Peace  Van  When I had worsted him and kept the Field  Which still I keep Thanks to the valiant  Yvor  Val  I once did think the Word of  Vanoc  sacred  You may confirm it still  Van  Where it is due  It shall not failYou never were my Foe  Those are your WordsYet when  Ostorius  died  And the Command devolv'd on you alone  You fought for  Cartismand  My DaughterNo  Were it to save her Life she should not wed  A  Roman  Val  Then hear meproud  Cornavian    Unthinking Prince I take you at your Word  Nor shall you forfeit it a second Time  She shall not wed she shall not be a Wife  But she shall be a SlaveAnd to a  Roman  The
