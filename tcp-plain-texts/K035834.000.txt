my good friend Testy do lower the pitch of your voice a little for to speak so very loud is really not wellbred  OLD TESTY  I'll speak as loud as I like and say what I like Damn your fine breedingan ounce of honesty is worth an hundred weight of it  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  There nowounce and hundred weight Can't you contrive to think and talk a little like a Man of Fashion When you quitted business you shou'd have dispos'd of your vulgarity with your stock in trade Copy me Do you find any thing vulgar about me  OLD TESTY  Psha you and I liv'd too long together to think of cajoling each other you are as vulgar as I amI wish you were half as honest  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  My good friend if we are not to attempt cajoling each other the less you say about your honesty the better  OLD TESTY  Why what have you to say against my honesty  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Nothing I am too well bred beside I was your partner in trade for twentyfive yearsI reap'd half the profits of your ingenuity and had you been honester I might be poorer But my dear friend let us settle our business a little quietly if you will be so kind Your son you say is come to towngood You insist he may be introduc'd to our ward Miss Hartleyhe shall  OLD TESTY  That's fair  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  I thought you'd say so because 'tis very unfair to my own son who being absent from England ought not to have a rival introduc'd to the Lady I wish to be his wife But remember as she cannot marry without our joint consent we must agree that which ever she prefers shall have our mutual approbation  OLD TESTY  Why yes  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Ah mine is the boy that will win her Educated with every advantage now receiving the last polish the finishing stroke to his accomplishments  in a Tour through Europe  Oh he is a  OLD TESTY  Yes he is a pretty boy That youth will put foreign ingenuity to the test If they can send him away more dissipated than they find him I will give them credit for one miracle  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Leave your growling good Mr Bear and look after your own unlick'd cub His country breeding will render him vastly pleasing to a young lady  OLD TESTY  He is a model of perfection Innocent himself he will never suspect that evil exists that may make him liable to imposition but I have adopted a remedy in my choice of a profession for him  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  As how pray  OLD TESTY  To render him in some degree a match for the roguery of the world I shall make him a Lawyer  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  And I dare say his Yorkshire simplicity will qualify him admirably for the profession  OLD TESTY  Well Flourish the only thing we were ever in one mind about was parting and I conclude you have no objection to it now  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  None in the least  OLD TESTY  I shall send my son and mind fair play's the word  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Certainly  Testy going  Let me see you out  OLD TESTY  Oh damn your civility Stay where you are  Exit  Old Testy  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Alone  Oh you pretty behaved accomplished creature Is it not strange that in so many years acquaintance the polish of my manners shold not have induced him to rub off his vulgar rust  Enter  Servant  SERVANT  Captain O'Neill Sir  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Shew the Captain in  Exit  Servant  Enter Captain  O'NIELL  I rejoice to see you Captain O'Niell You are welcome to town  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  Sir Simon Flourish your most obedientPermit me to enquire after her Ladyship and your lovely ward Miss Hartley  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Both in fine health and spirits and they will very much regret not being at home to receive you  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  Proud as I am always to pay them my profound respects at this moment my business lies entirely with you Sir Simon  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Oh Lord I hope he don't want to borrow money of me  Aside  Your commands if you please Captain  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  An affair of honour compels me to be troublesome to you  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  An affair of honour compels him to be troublesome to me Oh that is worse than borrowing money  Aside  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  My wounded reputation must be heal'd  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Oh Lord Oh Lord How have I offended him  Aside  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  Slander can only be washed out with blood  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Oh my precious blood Oh dear Oh dear I suppose I have said some ill natur'd thing of him behind his back for I am sure I never durst affront him to his face  Aside  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  A little after your leaving Bath  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  A little after my leaving Bath  repeats falteringly  Oh yes some damn'd goodnatur'd friend blabb'd when my back was turned  aside  Why really Captain I don't recollect what can have given you offence at Bath  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  That I readily believe for it would be hard to expect you to recollect what you never heard  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Eh  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  I say Sir Simon you cannot be expected to know the insult offer'd me by a man who did not arrive till you were gone  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Oh the man that insulted you did not arrive till I was gone Lord what a load is off my  mind  Aside  And so Captain a villain had the audacity to insult you  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  I was insulted Sir Simon  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  You'll not let him live You'll tear him to atomsI know you willBlood and thunder if it were my case  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  Be cool Sir Simonyou are too desperate  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  I amI know it is my fault but fire and furyCan I assist you in this business  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  That is the very cause of my visit to youWill you honour me so far as to deliver a bit of a message for me  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  What carry a challenge for you  eagerly  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  Exactly  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  What and be your Second  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  If I may take the liberty to ask such a favour  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  My dear Captain give me your hand I am the happiest man alive to serve a friend I'll see you through this affair I'll take care of you Where am I to go What am I to do first  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  Why first of all there is a little preparatory business Before I can receive satisfaction for the injury done me I must put it in the power of my adversary to give it me  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  As how pray  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  You must know the young man is unluckily in prison for debt and as he has friends who are able to release him I thought it wou'd be taking a liberty to rob them of a pleasure they have the best right tobut they scorn to be outdone in politeness and I believe wou'd let him remain till doomsday before they would dispute the point with me  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  And so you mean to pay his debts on purpose to fight him  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  I do and I wish I had a better motive for though injur'd honour demands atonement I wou'd rather do one little bit of a kindness than revenge a thousand injuries  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Will it cost you much  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  More than is quite convenient and therefore I must trespass on your goodness in a second instance  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Eh what how  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  I shall be under the necessity of troubling you for three hundred pounds  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Lord it is a vast deal of money I think you had better not fight him till there is an Act of Insolvency Or could'nt you get a snug little room in the Prison and fight him at his own home that would be more genteel and accommodating No noplague take it that won't do for if you kill him they will keep  us there I should like to see you fight amazingly but then to pay three hundred pounds for it it is very dear I only paid a guinea to see Johnson and Big Ben and their way of fighting is quite as fashionable nowa days  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  Understand me Sir Simon I don't intend to be under an obligation to you or any man I have brought my Commission as security for the sum  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Security my dear friend do you think I want security That is like a Trader there is no security with People of Fashion Yet I may as well take it by way of memorandum  Takes the Commission  Well tell me who he is and where he is to be found I'll carry him the money and the challenge  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  Oh by no means He must not know the money comes from me He may feel it unpleasant to be under an obligation to a man he has wrong'd and to know that I had injur'd his feelings would not be the way to satisfy mine  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  You are a very strange man There is the money manage it your own way  Gives him Notes  CAPTAIN O'NIELL  I thank you and as soon as he has got the miseries of a prison a little out of his mind you shall wait on him  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  As soon as you please The sooner the better  CAPTAIN O'NEILL  You are too impetuous you fiery little fellow We must not be in a hurry for misfortune is apt to lower a man's spirit and I scorn to meet a foe in a state of degradation  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Well you must act as you chuse only fight soon for I shall think of nothing else I know I am a desperate dog When I was at school they us'd to call me the little GameCock You are to do as you like but were it my own affair I should stand close muzzle to muzzle toe to toeDamme I'd fight him in a sawpit I wonder I have not fought yet I never was even ask'd to be a Second till now but I believe I know pretty well from the newspapers what a Second has to doTo load the pistols measure the ground take care they stand near enough and let them fire as long as they like I believe that is all Oh no If the parties are wounded he is to leave them on the ground to the mercy of chance and take care of himself  CAPTAIN O'NEILL  I am not to dictate your conduct Sir Simon only it might be well if every Second would consider that his office is that of a Friend to adjust an affair of Honour▪ not of a Sheriff to witness an execution Good morning Sir Simon  Exit  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Alone  What a lucky dog I am To be concerned in a Duel was the only thing wanting to compleat me as a Man of Fashion I shall state the case next day in the newspapers with my name at full length Then a glorious confusion always takes place People just remember the names but forget whether they were  Principals or Seconds Oh my character will be up I shall be a Man of Fashion indeed  Enter  Lady FLOURISH  and  Miss HARTLEY  LADY FLOURISH  My dear Sir Simon how glad I am you're at home If I am ever so little a while away from you my darling it appears a long tedious age How does my lovy do Do look tender 'tis so becoming to you and beside if you don't you know you break my heart  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Now really Lady Flourish you are too fond before company indeed you are 'Tis your only fault my dear But you ought to consider that to be fond of a husband at all is very unfashionable and therefore when a wife feels that amiable weakness she ought never to expose it before people  LADY FLOURISH  But I can't help exposing it Miss Hartly knows I have been talking of nothing else but my dearest the whole time I have been out all the while I was buying my china and my gold muslins and my lace I was longing to be at home with my darling  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Lord my dear I wish you had indulg'd your longing and then you wou'd n't have laid out so much money And how is my dear Miss Hartley You don't seem in spirits  MISS HARTLEY  Indeed I am not but the cause of my want of spirits must remain a secret to you  Aside  They sir who like me never knew misfortune are apt to trifle with their felicity  SONG  MISS HARTLEY  THE heart that has ne'er tasted sorrow  E'en happiness often will cloy  And we ever from misery borrow  Our knowledge of exquisite joy  To those who all anguish wou'd smother  The best use of life is unknown  To feel for the woes of another  Or value the bliss that's their own  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Old Testy's stupid bumpkin of a son is to be introduced to you this morning but there is no fear of his rivalling my boy Jack How I long to see the rogue again Where is he now I wonder May be eating macaroni with the Grand Duke or having the honour of kissing the toe of his Holinesss the Pope Oh what high fellows my son is living with  LADY FLOURISH  Where ever he is my dearest he can meet nobody so fine a gentleman as his papa  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Oh you are too partial Lady Flourisha great deal a great deal too partial I have news for youCaptain O'Neill has been here  LADY FLOURISH  Captain O'Neill in town  Earnestly  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  I shou'd like to tell them of his engaging me to be his Second  Aside  You know the Captain is a man of great bravery and knowing me to be of the same turnhum hum we have  had a good deal of conversation on the subject of Duelling  LADY FLOURISH  I hope the Captain is not going to fight a Duel▪  Greatly alarm'd  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Oh dear no  LADY FLOURISH  I am glad to hear you say so I was quite agitated at the thought of any friend of your's being engag'd in so horrid a business  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  I must not blab I find She'd lay an information and destroy my renown Were I a Principal instead of a Second I shou'd be vastly oblig'd to her  Aside  I wonder how many Duels Jack has fought abroadthat is fought or been Second in 'Tis just the same thing The credit is the same and so is the danger pretty nearly for the Principals are often so cursedly frighten'd that it is an even chance whether they hit their antagonist or their own Second  MISS HARTLEY  Though I abhor the practice yet when men deem such trials necessary I hope they conduct themselves with proper courage  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  That is mighty well of you You don't know what it is to receive a man's fire or you wou'd not talk so lightly about it  Enter  Servant  SERVANT  Young Mr Testy Sir  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Very well  LADY FLOURISH  Come my dear rest yourself a little before you encounter the fatigue of this Bumpkin's conversation  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Ay do I'll talk to him first  Exeunt  Lady Flourish  and  Miss Hartley  Enter  Young TESTY  SIR

than what you us'd to be I remember as thof it was but yesterday when father and you us'd to weigh I and Jack Flourish in the great warehouse scales and I always were heaviest  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Yes and you'll continue heaviest as long as you live▪ But Tom don't talk about weights and scales 'tis so vulgar Damn Trade and all that belongs to it I am a Gentleman and a Knight now  YOUNG TESTY  Yes Sir Simon▪ so they tell me but for all that▪ don't damn Trade for I don't think as how you'd a' been a Gentleman and a Knight if the money you got by the warehouse had not given you a bit of a lift  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Oh the vulgar young dog  Aside  YOUNG TESTY  Well Sir Simon father sent me a courting and so you see I am come so no more words let's set about it  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Oh yes with all my heart I'll see if Miss Hartley is ready to receive you What a young Savage I dare say they wou'd buy him at Exeter 'Change  Exit  YOUNG TESTY  Well faint heart never won fair lady Dang it I'll shew her a Yorkshire boy is not afraid of a pretty girl  SONG  YOUNG TESTY  I NE'ER by a lass yet was scouted  I know the right method to get her  No cringing for me  I'll soon let her see  That I'm bold and she'll like me the better  I'm a boy that's not easily flouted  If she give herself airs why e'en let her  When to kiss her I try  "You're rude" Sir she'll cry  Why I am and you like me the better  When she finds that I'm not to be routed  And at morn noon and night I beset her  She'll alter her tone  And readily own  Tho' I'm rude that she likes me the better  SCENE II  Another Room in Sir Simon's House Enter  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  and  KITTY  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  And now give me a kiss you little rogue you  Kisses her  KITTY  Lord Sir Simon how can you be so rude  SIR SIMON FLOURISH

raffleshop at Margate Here the Booby comes Now you may go and fetch Miss Hartley  Enter  Young TESTY  There Mr Testy good bye I leave you to your lovemaking What a Lout it is  Aside to  Kitty  and

objection we may even be ax'd in church together  KITTY  What does the Booby mean Lord he takes me for my Mistress Not such a Booby as I thought him  Aside  YOUNG TESTY  Why you don't answer Miss Speak outdon't be shamefac'd So as I was saying I have no disliking to you nor liking for any body else and if you have no particular disliking to me more than to other people I dare say we shall be as happy a couple as goes  KITTY  Gemini what a flutter I am in If I can but make him believe I am my Mistress my fortune is made I must try to behave like a Lady but if I am modest like my Mistress I shall never pass upon him No no I must be free and dashing as fine Ladies are in general  Aside  Why young man I have been considering what you have been saying and as I don't think you quite so great a brute as I expected you to be I don't much care if I take you upon trial  YOUNG TESTY  Take me upon trialWhat does she make a horse of me But dang it free and easyI like her the better But mayhap Miss if I am not so great a brute now I may be a greater when I am married Ah what do you say to that my tight Filly  KITTY  I'll do all I can to make you fashionable  YOUNG TESTY  Thank you thank you

Ma'am  And for Lawyers too like me  No trouble it at all is  Since hornfair remov'd we see  To Westminster old Hall is  BOTH  Then since we agree so easy to be  Let's marry as soon as we can  For not to demur whate'er may occur  Is surely the very best plan  SCENE III  The King's Bench  HARCOURT  solus  HARCOURT  Was ever man more miserably circumstanced Bred up as heir to a splendid fortune  and all my hopes destroy'd by the caprice of a splenetic old uncle Shut up here in the King's Bench for debt and not only depriv'd of the happiness of beholding the woman I adore but asham'd to acquaint her with the wretchedness of my situation  AIR  HARCOURT  ONCE all that cou'd enchant the sight  Enraptur'd fancy drew  And deck'd each prospect of delight  With tints of brightest hue  In fairy loveliness array'd  The beauteous objects shone  While charm'd I gaz'd Hope sweetly said  "These prospects are thine own"  But fancy now from forms of joy  Averts her sick'ning sight  Her pencil horrors wild employ  And scenes of blackest night  The dismal pictures rise to view  Where direst ills combine  Despair exclaims "bid Hope adieu  These prospects now are thine"  Enter a  Servant  belonging to the Prison  SERVANT  Mr Flourish Sir has sent you the book of travels he borrow'd and says he will call on you presently  HARCOURT  That good humour'd whimsical fellow Flourish is always welcome to me  SERVANT  It is queer enough that his father Sir Simon  Flourish should be humm'd so as to think he is going the Tour of Europe when all the while he never got a step farther than St George's Fields  Exit  HARCOURT  Here he comes  Young  Flourish  singing without  Over the Hills c  Enter in a shabby lightcolour'd Coat with black Breeches and Boots  YOUNG FLOURISH  Ah my boy Harcourt how are you  HARCOURT  Why Jack what makes you booted  YOUNG FLOURISH  A man ought to be booted when he's on a journey An't I going the Tour of Europe  HARCOURT  Oh I beg your pardon I had forgot but you don't seem furnish'd with a very elegant riding▪dressboots and black are not very correcthey  YOUNG FLOURISH  The customs of countries differ but to tell you the truth so much travelling has made vast havock among my leather and as for my black small clothes I wear them as mourning for the demise of my last colour'd pair  HARCOURT  But my dear Jack what can be the joke of your staying in this sad place  YOUNG FLOURISH  All the joke was in getting here Staying is not quite so comical  HARCOURT  But Jack I must know what brought you here  YOUNG FLOURISH  Poll  HARCOURT  PollWhat Poll  YOUNG FLOURISH  Not know PollWhere the devil have you liv'dNot know PollWhy Poll is the rageIn Hyde Park every morningrides the best horsedrives the best curriclegives the best dinnersdamme the first Dutchess in the land envies Poll  HARCOURT  I beg Poll's pardon for not knowing her  YOUNG FLOURISH  So you ought for Poll's familiar and kind she'd have no objection to knowing you But the thing is father said I shou'd be a Man of Fashion and so I am an't IDamme you still look at my legswell blacklegs don't make me a bit less a Man of Fashion  HARCOURT  Oh by no means  YOUNG FLOURISH  WellBut about PollAs I was to be a Man of Fashion who so proper to make me one as Poll Poll has made and unmade half the fine men of the day I kept Poll when I was at school Poll stuck to me at college and when father fix'd I should travel and see the world who so fit to shew it me as Poll  HARCOURT  Well why did n't Poll shew it you  YOUNG FLOURISH  She did she shew'd me here  HARCOURT  But why not take her abroad with you  YOUNG FLOURISH  She wou'd not go Poll said she wou'd do any thing but cross the water with me And I could not find in my heart to go abroad without her So I touch'd father's cash and resolv'd to finish my education in my own country  HARCOURT  Very patriotic truly  YOUNG FLOURISH  Well father went to BathI staid in townthe money flewPoll knew how to dash it When all was gone it was natural enough to come here you know  HARCOURT  But how were you able to leave Poll  YOUNG FLOURISH  She did not trouble me to think about that when the money was gone Poll left me  HARCOURT  So Poll wou'd not follow your fortunes to the King's BenchHow unkind  YOUNG FLOURISH  So I told her"Ah Poll" said I "'tis damn'd illnatur'd to leave me"  HARCOURT  And what did she say  YOUNG FLOURISH  She only laugh'd and said"She told me at first she'd do any thing but cross the water with me"  HARCOURT  You must throw yourself on your father's mercy at last and the sooner you do it the better  Servant  brings in a Letter  YOUNG FLOURISH  For me  SERVANT  No Sirfor Mr Harcourt  YOUNG FLOURISH  Ah nobody writes to me  HARCOURT  Reads  "I am led to believe the enclos'd notes will liberate you They are sent for that purpose"AstonishingNo nameDoes any body wait  SERVANT  No Sir  Exit  HARCOURT  This must be from my dear girl  YOUNG FLOURISH  Ah you are a happy fellow Your dear girl writes to you Though Poll would not cross the water she might send me a letter now and then It is damn'd unkindBut no no poor girl I shou'dn't scold her for what she can't help I ought to remember Poll can't write  HARCOURT  This must be my Harriot's generosity Charming girl How could she discover my situationBut what will not Love discover  YOUNG FLOURISH  So you're going to leave me 'Tis devillsh hard to be cut by every body  HARCOURT  Depend on it my dear fellow I will be with you soon  YOUNG FLOURISH  Ah do come and see me Don't be like Poll afraid of crossing the water  HARCOURT  No Jackdepend upon it AdieuNow to my charming girl  Exit  YOUNG FLOURISH  Ah your's is a charming girl indeed to send you moneyIf Poll had a million I dare say she wou'dn't think of sending me a shilling and yet she us'd to say she lov'd me vastly  SONG  YOUNG FLOURISH  WHEN to my pretty Poll I went  And I to travel sought her  "Ah stay at home dear Jack" says she  "I cannot cross the water"  What could I do Away I flew  A curricle I bought her  Six smoaking bays all Hyde Park's gaze  From Tattersall's I brought her  "Dear Jack" says she "how kind you  be  She'd coax like Eve's own daughter  "With you will I both live and die  "Do all but cross the water"  Then splashing dashing through the town  She drove the stare of all  The echo of her rattling wheels  Was "There goes pretty Poll"  "Oh pretty pretty Poll"  From ev'ry tongue the echo rung  "See there goes pretty Poll"  What a lad then was I  All to dress at me try  And my praise to withhold none so currish  With a girl so divine  Such dinners such wine  What a damn'd clever dog was Jack Flourish  But an end to my cash  And my fame goes to smash  No friends my good qualities nourish  For they once so kind  Now agree in one mind  What a damn'd stupid flat is Jack Flourish  Thus cut by my friends by bailiffs seiz'd  And this vile limbo near  Yet with one hope I still was pleas'd  That Poll my cage wou'd cheer  To Poll I told where I must go  And not to leave me sought her  She laughing cried "Dear Jack you know  "I cannot cross the water"  ACT II  SCENE I  A Garden belonging to Sir Simon's House  HARRIOT  discovered alone  How distressing is my Harcourt's absence and the mysterious concealment of his residence encreases my anxiety Can he think so meanly of me as to suppose his loss of fortune will lesson my affection  AIR  MISS HARTLEY  NOT mine the narrow soul assur'd  In riches joy to find  Not mine by title's glare allur'd  To genuine merit blind  In wealth and rank who seek for bliss  Contempt or pity move  They never chuse so much amiss  Whose hearts were form'd for love  Enter  HARCOURT  HARCOURT  My life  HARRIOT  Oh Charles  HARCOURT  My angel what a tedious absence  HARRIOT  If my Charles thought it so why not sooner fly to his adoring Harriot  HARCOURT  I follow'd you to Bath but unluckily you had left it the day before I arriv'd and what then happen'd I could not prevail on myself to disclose to you I was resolv'd to bear my misfortunes alone but your kindness has dispell'd them and now I fly with gratitude to thank my deliverer  HARRIOT  Your deliverer  HARCOURT  Yes my Harriot attempt not to conceal your generous conduct But for you a prison wou'd have been my habitation for life  HARRIOT  A prison Charles Has such been your distress and yet conceal it from me  HARCOURT  Can it be possible that I am not indebted to you for my deliverance  HARRIOT  By concealing from me your situation you prevented me from being your deliverer Oh Charles that was a false pride which avoided the assistance of her who loves you True affection shou'd seek occasions for receiving kindness conscious it bestows most delight when it affords the power of obliging  HARCOURT  Pardon me Harriot▪ Poverty will be proud But what am I to think See here my love this cover enclosed notes sufficient to discharge my debts  HARRIOT  Whoever has had the pleasure of releasing you claims my gratitude yet excites my envy  HARCOURT  Generous girl To avoid suspicion I had better leave you now my Harriot  DUET  HARCOURT  and  MISS HARTLEY  MISS HARTLEY  AH must you

desperate dog indeed▪  Exit  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Alone  I have been very unlucky I am afraid I have not acted quite like a Man of Fashion In the first place to interrupt a Gentleman's making love to my wife was not at all like a Man of Fashionnothat was very low breeding indeed As to getting a beatingthat will happen to Men of Fashion now and then But one part of my behaviour I hope sets all to rightsI behav'd very ill and I ask'd pardon If that is not like a Man of Fashion the devil's in't  Exit  SCENE III  Inside of the King's Bench with a View of the High Wall Enter  Young FLOURISH  YOUNG FLOURISH  I have been puzzling over maps these two hours to find out where I have been or rather where I ought to have been and 'tis a great deal more troublesome to travel in imagination than in reality for I must keep my eyes open while I am tracing my journey on paper but if I had gone it in earnest I might have slept comfortably from post to post as most Travellers do  Enter  HARCOURT  and  Captain O'NEIL  Ah Charles my boy coming to see me so soon is kind indeed  HARCOURT  And I have brought a friend to see you  CAPT O'NEIL  What a mighty queer world we live in This is a gentleman I am proud to hear call me friendand yet half an hour ago I was ready to cut his throat  YOUNG FLOURISH  Cut your friend's throat  CAPT O'NEIL  Why it happens every daydon't it Your making a wonder of that proves you live out of the world  YOUNG FLOURISH  By your account to live out of the world seems the only chance one has to live at all  CAPT O'NEIL  You are pretty right there for between those who having too little courage want to be thought to have enough and those who have so much 'tis always boiling overa quiet man's life is in a constant state of requisition  YOUNG FLOURISH  But how came you two to quarrel  CAPT O'NEIL  The only way that two honest men can quarrelby mistakeHowever before we troubled our pistols to speak for us we thought it no dishonour to speak a little for ourselves by which means we found out that though we met to settle a dispute devil a dispute we had to settle  YOUNG FLOURISH  How was that  CAPT O'NEIL  Why it appears that this same good looking  countenance of mine is unlucky enough to resemble the phiz of a Gentleman Blacklegs who by a little trick or two in the way of his trade disburthen'd our friend of his cash He thought when he met me in the Rooms at Bath and the place to be sure▪ was not much in my favour that he had nick'd his man and accosted me accordingly We lost one another in the croud and he departed in his error I learnt his name and follow'd him to London where if I hadn't had wisdom enough to ask an explanation I might have been sent out of the world for the misfortune of resembling a scoundrel  HARCOURT  How much I must ever feel bound to you  CAPT O'NEIL  Ah Harcourt appearances are very deceitful and he who forms his opinions from them will blunder on in the dark let the sun shine ever so bright  YOUNG FLOURISH  And that is blundering indeed  HARCOURT  Captain O'Neilmy friend Jack Flourish is a very whimsical fellowIf he had been out of Limbo you wou'd have seen him earlier for I shou'd have brought him for my Second  YOUNG FLOURISH  No you would not for to be Second in a Duel is in my mind an employment pretty nearly as honourable as to be Jack Ketch's Deputy  CAPT O'NEIL  All the Flourishes are not of that opinion I presume you are no relation to that little gamecock Sir Simon  YOUNG FLOURISH  My father a little gamecock  CAPT O'NEIL  Sir Simon your father Why Sir Simon's son is on his travels  YOUNG FLOURISH  Yes Sir Simon's son travels like a millhorse a great deal in a small space But here he is here's Jack Flourish and if he had not had the wisdom to stay at home he wou'd have lost the good fortune of becoming acquainted with you He is a fool who quits Old Englandfor damme if he'll find such fellows any where as he leaves behind him  CAPT O'NEIL  I should be jealous of your praise if Old England and Old Ireland were not exactly the same spot of ground So you are really and truly the fine travell'd young Gentleman Mr Flourish Oh you are a hopeful boy I assure you your father believes you have been seen and admir'd in every Court in Europe  YOUNG FLOURISH  So I ought to have been seen and admir'd in every Court in Europe but I was unluckily introduc'd at the Court of King's Bench and am not likely to visit any other Court in a hurry  HARCOURT  You must contrive to be on terms with your father to assist me in obtaining his sanction to my passion for his Ward Miss Hartley  CAPTAIN O'NEIL  What you have a passion for Miss Hartley So have I tooThat is unlucky  HARCOURT  A passion for Miss Hartley  CAPT O'NEIL  Yes but I am by no means sure she has a passion for me so if you can prove she has for you there are two to one against me  YOUNG FLOURISH  I'll lay the odds  CAPT O'NEIL  Is it so Enough said then He that can't make sport never let him spoil it 'Tis true I had a liking for the young Lady but the first principle of my liking wasto makeher happy and as long as that is brought about whether by you or me is the same thing among friends Ha ha ha ha my young Traveller I can't help laughing to think that this very morning I was dusting the coat of a relation of your's  YOUNG FLOURISH  That was very kind of you and while your hand is in I'll thank you to dust minefor I'm sure it wants it  CAPT O'NEIL  Farewel my young Travellerevery assistance I can give you may depend onWell Charles you are a lucky dog to get such a sweet girl as Miss Hartley Oh the dear creatures how I love them  SONG  CAPT O'NEIL  IN the smiles of the fair  Is the best cure for care  If ruffled our bosom they charm it to ease  Or with eye sweetly glancing  Our hearts they set dancing  They calm us and rouse us e'en just as they please  The wise prop of a state  Or the warrior so great  Oft bows down to kiss Beauty's rod on his knees  'Tis the province of Beauty  To teach men their duty  For women can do with us just what they please  E'en the miser quits gold  Their bright charms to behold  And gives them his soul for he yields them his keys  The dear rogues are so clever  Oh bless 'em for ever  And may they rule over us just as they please  HARCOURT  Jack I've been thinking how you are to get at liberty  YOUNG FLOURISH  Have you Well how  HARCOURT  Acquaint your father that you are return'd from abroad then get a Rule for the day and see him his joy at the sight of you may soften his heart and pave the way for your forgiveness  YOUNG FLOURISH  Well said

pulse proclaim thy sight  The bounding heart's tumultuous beat  Swelling its kindred heart to meet  Are joys for which all pain I'd prove  And never never cease to love  HARRIOT  Here comes Sir Simon

sword ne'er to raise  In ravage and plunder's fell cause  But to guard sacred honour's pure laws  And the pride of the base to bring down  Still o'er the fall'n foe  Let pity's tear flow  Not sound forth the triumph of blood  No Britain thou art great and good  Let this thy glory be  This let admiring nations see  That with thee  Dwells sweet Humanity  Sir I must now take my leave  SIR SIMON

surebut Jack is come home and I will think no more of them  Exit  HARRIOT  comes forward  HARRIOT  I will endeavour to repress every anxious thought and dwell only on the prospect of future happiness

 KITTY  I don't know Sir as to marrying but I have a little bit of paper here which  OLD TESTY  Hold your tongueSay no more I believe you are quite good enough for the blockhead you have got and so he

I might have the satisfaction of sending you out of the world But Sir Simon this gentleman in fortune is equal to the Lady he has wedded  HARCOURT  Captain O'Neil I am not conscious of what you are asserting  CAPTAIN O'NEIL  But I am or I wou'd not assert it Understanding that your Uncle had taken it into his head to be angry with you for nothing at all I called on the old gentleman to talk with him a little about it"If your Nephew had been  guilty of a dishonourable action" said I "devil a word wou'd O'Neil offer in his behalf but as he has been a dupe to the villainy of others restore him to your favour and launch him into the world again with experience for his Pilot"So the old gentleman shook hands with me and swore he was ready to do the same with you as soon as you pleased  HARCOURT  Thanks are too poor for such nobleness of soul  CAPTAIN O'NEIL  Nobleness of soul for walking a few steps out of my common road for the pleasure of reconciling a discarded Nephew to a rich old Uncle Oh if people wou'd but just lengthen their morning's walk to do a few good natur'd actions they can scarcely conceive what health and spirits such exercise wou'd give them and how much

I don't think keeping Terms here absolutely necessary for the finish of every young gentleman's education yet as a school of adversity it has taught me this lessonNever by folly and extravagance to run the chance of returning when once you do me the honour to take my name out of the books  CAPTAIN O'NEIL  Come you must forgive him You know the brave are always compassionate  SIR SIMON FLOURISH  Very true besides it is useless to repine at  what is past especially as you acknowledge you have learn'd some good which I am not quite sure you wou d have done by travellingAnd if your friends here
