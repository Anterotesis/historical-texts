 VERSES HUMBLY ADDRESS'D TO Sir THOMAS HANMER On his EDITION of Shakespear's WORKS  By a GENTLEMAN of OXFORD  LONDON  Printed for M COOPER in  PaternosterRow  Price Six Pence  TO Sir  Thomas Hanmer  SIR  _WHILE own'd by You with Smiles the Muse surveys  Th' expected Triumph of her sweetest Lays  While stretch'd at Ease she boasts your Guardian Aid  Secure and happy in her sylvan Shade  Excuse her Fears who scarce a Verse bestows  In just Remembrance of the Debt she owes  With conscious Awe she hears the Critic's Fame  And blushing hides her Wreath at  Shakespear  's Name  Long slighted  Fancy  with a Mother's Care  Wept o'er his Works and felt the last Despair  Torn from her Head she saw the Roses fall  By all deserted tho' admir'd by all  " And oh she cry'd shall Science still resign  " Whate'er is Nature's and whate'er is mine  " Shall  Taste  and  Art  but shew a cold Regard  " And scornful Pride reject th' unletter'd Bard  " Ye myrtled Nymphs who own my gentle Reign  " Tune the sweet Lyre and grace my airy Train  " If where ye rove your searching Eyes have known  " One perfect Mind which Judgment calls its own  " There ev'ry Breast its fondest Hopes must bond  " And ev'ry Muse with Tears await her Friend  'Twas then fair  Isis  from her Stream arose  In kind Compassion of her Sister's Woes  'Twas then she promis'd to the mourning Maid  Th' immortal Honours which thy Hands have paid  " My bestlov'd Son she said shall yet restore  " Thy ruin'd Sweets and Fancy weep no more  Each rising Art by slow Gradation moves  Toil builds on Toil and Age on Age improves  The Muse alone unequal dealt her Rage  And grac'd with noblest Pomp her earliest Stage  Preserv'd thro' Time the speaking Scenes impart  Each changeful Wish of  Phaedra  's tortur'd Heart  Or paint the Curse that mark'd the  The  Oedipus  of  Sophocles  Theban  's Reign  A Bed incestuous and a Father slain  Line after Line our pitying Eyes o'erflow  Trace the sad Tale and own another's Woe  To  Rome  remov'd with equal Pow'r to please  The  Comic  Sisters kept their native Ease  With jealous Fear declining  Greece  beheld  Her own  Menander  's Art almost excell'd  But ev'ry Muse essay'd to raise in vain  Some labour'd Rival of her  Tragic  Strain  Ilissus'  Laurels tho' transferr'd with Toil  Droop'd their fair Leaves nor knew th' unfriendly Soil  When  Rome  herself her envy'd Glories dead  No more Imperial stoop'd her conquer'd Head  Luxuriant  Florence  chose a softer Theme  While all was Peace by  Arno  's silver Stream  With sweeter Notes th'  Etrurian  Vales complain'd  And Arts reviving tolda  Cosmo  reign'd  Their wanton Lyres the Bards of  Provence  strung  Sweet flow'd the Lays but Love was all they sung  The gay Description could not fail to move  For led by Nature all are Friends to Love  But Heav'n still rising in its Works decreed  The perfect Boast of Time should last succeed  The beauteous Union must appear at length  Of  Tuscan  Fancy and  Athenian  Strength  One greater Muse  Eliza  's Reign adorn  And ev'n a  Shakespear  to her Fame be born  Yet ah so bright her Morning's op'ning Ray  In vain our  Britain  hop'd an equal Day  No second Growth the Western Isle could bear  At once exhausted with too rich a Year  Too nicely  Johnson  knew the Critic's Part  Nature in him was almost lost in Art  Of softer Mold the gentle  Fletcher  came  The next in Order as the next in Name  With pleas'd Attention 'midst his Scenes we find  Each glowing Thought that warms the Female Mind  Each melting Sigh and ev'ry tender Tear  The Lover's Wishes and the Virgin's Fear  His  Their Characters are thus distinguish'd by Mr  Dryden  ev'ry Strain the Loves and Graces own  But stronger  Shakespear  felt for  Man  alone  Drawn by his Pen our ruder Passions stand  Th' unrivall'd Picture of his early Hand  With gradual Steps and slow exacter  France  Saw Art's fair Empire o'er her Shores advance  By length of Toil a bright Perfection knew  Correctly bold and just in all she drew  Till late  Corneille  from Epick  The favourite Author of the Elder  Corneille  Lucan  brought  The full Expression and the  Roman  Thought  And classic Judgment gain'd to sweet  Racine  The temp'rate Strength of  Maro's  chaster Line  But wilder far the  British  Laurel spread  And Wreaths less artful crown our Poet's Head  Yet He alone to ev'ry Scene could give  Th' Historian's Truth and bid the Manners live  Wak'd at his Call I view with glad Surprize  Majestic Forms of mighty Monarchs rise  There  Henry  's Trumpets spread their loud Alarms  And laurel'd Conquest waits her Hero's Arms  Here gentler  Edward  claims a pitying Sigh  Scarce born to Honours and so soon to die  Yet shall thy Throne unhappy Infant bring  No Beam of Comfort to the guilty King  The  Tempus erit Turno magno cum optaverit emptum Intactum Pallanta  c  Time shall come when  Glo'ster  's Heart shall bleed  In Life's last Hours with Horror of the Deed  When dreary Visions shall at last present  Thy vengeful Image in the midnight Tent  Thy Hand unseen the secret Death shall bear  Blunt the weak Sword and break th' oppressive Spear  Where'er we turn by Fancy charm'd we find  Some sweet Illusion of the cheated Mind  Oft wild of Wing she calls the Soul to rove  With humbler Nature in the rural Grove  Where Swains contented own the quiet Scene  And twilight Fairies tread the circled Green  Drest by her Hand the Woods and Vallies smile  And Spring diffusive decks th'  enchanted Isle  O blest in all that Genius gives to charm  Whose Morals mend us and whose Passions warm  Oft let my Youth attend thy various Page  Where rich Invention rules th' unbounded Stage  There ev'ry Scene the Poet's Warmth may raise  And melting Music find the softest Lays  O might the Muse with equal Ease persuade  Expressive Picture to adopt thine Aid  Some pow'rful  Raphael  shou'd again appear  And Arts consenting fix their Empire here  Methinks ev'n now I view some fair Design  Where breathing Nature lives in ev'ry Line  Chaste and subdu'd the modest Colours lie  In fair Proportion to th' approving Eye  And see where  See the Tragedy of  Julius Caesar  Antony  lamenting stands  In fixt Distress and spreads his pleading Hands  O'er the pale Corse the Warrior seems to bend  Deep sunk in Grief and mourns his murther'd Friend  Still as they press he calls on all around  Lifts the torn Robe and points the bleeding Wound  But  Coriolanus  See Mr  Spence  's Dialogues on the  Odyssey  who is he whose Brows exalted bear  A Rage impatient and a fiercer Air  Ev'n now his Thoughts with eager Vengeance doom  The last sad Ruin of ungrateful  Rome  Till slowadvancing o'er the tented Plain  In sable Weeds appear the Kindredtrain  The frantic Mother leads their wild Despair  Beats her swoln Breast and rends her silver Hair  And see he yieldsthe Tears unbidden start  And conscious Nature claims th' unwilling Heart  O'er all the Man conflicting Passions rise  Rage  grasps the Sword while  Pity  melts the Eyes  Thus gen'rous Critic as thy Bard inspires  The Sister Arts shall nurse their drooping Fires  Each from his Scenes her Stores alternate bring  Spread the fair Tints or wake the vocal String  Those  Sibyl  Leaves the Sport of ev'ry Wind  For Poets ever were a careless Kind  By thee dispos'd no farther Toil demand  But just to Nature own thy forming Hand  So spread o'er  Greece  th' harmonious Whole unknown  Ev'n  Homer  's Numbers charm'd by Parts alone  Their own  Ulysses  scarce had wander'd more  By Winds and Waters cast on ev'ry Shore  When rais'd by Fate some former  Hanmer  join'd  Each beauteous Image of the tuneful Mind  And bad like Thee his  Athens  ever claim  A fond Alliance with the Poet's Name  Oxford  Dec  FINIS
