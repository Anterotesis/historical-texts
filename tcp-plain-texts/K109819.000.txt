compiling of it that when but a few of them are mentioned I hope for a candid and favourable Judgment  AFTER I had collected in private what Materials I could I was then obliged to go publickly in Quest of more Upon this I publish'd an  Advertisement  desiring the Assistance of such as had ancient Writings or Deeds or any other Things that might contribute to the helping of the Work  THIS immediately occasioned the following Reflecti∣ons that it might be of dangerous Consequence to shew ancient Writings that He was but a Curate that under∣took the Work that his Abilities therefore of Pocket and  Mind must be vastly unequal to such a Task in short above Months before the Publication of it some have made it their Business so great has been their Illnature and Prejudice as to take all Ways and Methods of decry∣ing it by Print by Manuscript lessening it in all Com∣panies to hinder it's Publication and speaking as freely of of it as if they were acquainted with every Line of it's Composition and by a Prophetick Spirit knew it to be as they talk'd of it  BY these Means I am certain I have been hindred of many Materials  BUT there are two grand Disappointments I met with in the Compiling of this Performance which must not be untaken Notice of The One is my not being so happy as to see Dr  Ellison  's Collection of the Antiquities of this Town A few indeed were sent me but having the same Copy from Mr  Douglas  they were of no Service and excepting these I saw no more 'Tis to be hoped as the Dr must have made a large Collection having been about it as is said for many Years that the present Possessor of them will oblige the Town with the Publication of Them and cure the Imperfections of the present Performance  THE other Disappointment is the not Meeting with those large Collections of Sir  Robert Shaftoe  taken No∣tice of by Bishop  Nicholson  in his  English Historical Library  I endeavoured after a Sight of them but they were then either lost or so mislaid that there was no coming at them  AND if I add to all this an Illness of many Months and which it pleases God still to continue  The Author did live but few Months after he wrote this Preface dying  Feb  which too fre∣quently obliges me to trust the Copies of others and de∣pend upon them I hope a few Errours and Failings will fall gently to my Share  HOWEVER in the midst of all this Malice and Illnature and these Disappointments there were some so communicative and generously assisting as to give all the Help they could They are the Gentlemen following  MR JOSUAH DOUGLAS who assisted me with a great Number of Materials  JOHN MILBANK  Esq  who sent me a Manuscript which is frequently mentioned  CHRSTOPHER HUNTER of  Durham  M D who has obliged me in the kindest Manner with several curious Manuscripts which are acknowledged in their proper Pla∣ces  The Rev Mr SMITH of  Melsonby  who sent me a Book of antient Deeds and Charters copy'd from one in  Ʋniver∣sity College  in  Oxford  relating to some Lands in this Town  JOHN THORNTON  Esq  of  Netherwitton  who o∣bliged me with a Sight of some ancient Writings parti∣cularly the Will of his famous Ancestor  Roger de Thornton  ROBERT SHAFTO of  Benwall  Esq  who contribu∣ted some ancient Writings particularly One relating to the Chanteries of the Churches of this Town  The following Gentlemen have also been very kind and ready in assisting me with Books Transactions Modern Papers  c  The Rev Dr THOMLINSON Rector of  Whickham  The Rev Mr DOCKWRAY Lecturer of St  Nicholas  The Rev Mr LODGE Master of the FreeSchool  The

that as in my Health I laid out all my Endeavours in the Collecting of Materials from all Quarters I could pos∣sibly come at any so I have now finish'd it according to the best of my Abilities and

Walls in the Country of the  OTTADINI  particularly the Walls of  HADRIAN  and  SEVERUS  which went through this TOWN The most ancient Name of this TOWN  I  T was about an hundred Years after the Landing of  Julius Caesar  in  this Island  when the  Brigantes  a popu∣lous and warlike Nation of the  Britains  whose Coun∣try extended from the North of  Humber  to the River  Tyne  containing the present Counties of  Yorkshire Dur∣ham Lancashire Westmoreland  and  Cumberland  were first assaulted by the  Romans  The  Britains  behaved themselves in the War with great Courage and Reso∣lution 'till at last in the Reign of  Vespasian  the great∣est Part of them were conquered After this in the Reign of  Titus Julius A∣gricola  the Lieutenant of  Britain  who was at least equally Famous for his Conquests over the Customs and Manners of the  Britains  as for his many Victories over them in Battle did in the third Year of his Lieutenancy make a Discovery of other Parts of this Island which were not brought under the  Roman  Yoke Upon which he marched Northward into the Country of the  Ottadini  which extends from the North of  Tyne  to the River  Taus  wa∣sting and destroying all before him 'till he came to the  Tay  it self And now according to some was the first Wall made in  Britain  But it was not pro∣perly  a Wall it was only a Line of Garrisons placed upon that Slip of Land between  EdinburghFrith  and  DunBritainFrith  for the Security of what they had already gain'd and if the Valour of  Agricola  's Army and the Renown of the  Roman  Name could have suffer'd it there was no Need of a further Search after the Bounds and Limits of  Britain  The  Friths  abovementioned called then  Glota  and  Bodotria  might have been very sufficient being the Arms of two opposite Seas and only separated by a small Space of Land which was well fortified with the  Roman  Garrisons so that the  Romans  were Lords of the whole South and had cast the Enemy as it were into another Island  Tacit in vit Agricol  But what could ever bound the Roman Glory and limit their ne∣ver satisfied Ambition It was not enough that they had intirely secured them∣selves for any Attempts of the  Caledonians  but  They  also were to be subdued This was effected in the th Year of  Agricola  's Lieutenancy in the reign of  Domitian  HOWEVER after this  Cambd  that further Part of the Island was left to the  The inha∣bitants went naked had no Houses to live in nei∣ther did they Till the Ground As one writeth  de praeda venatione Frondibus{que} Arborum vi∣vant degent in Tentoriis Nudi sine calceis  Grey ex Xiphilin'  Barbarians  as neither Pleasant nor Fruitful but this nether Part was fairly reduc'd to a  Roman  Province which was not governed by Consular or Pro∣consular Deputies but was counted Praesidial and appropriate to the  Cae∣sars  as being a Province annex'd to the Empire after the Division of Pro∣vinces made by  Augustus  and having  Propraetors  of its own  HADRIAN  who was made Emperor about the Year of our Lord made the second Wall  Cambd  He drew a Wall says  Spartian  of eighty Miles in Length to divide the Barbarians from the  Romans  which one may gather from what follows in  Spartian  to have been in the Fashion of a  Mural Hedge  of large Stakes fix'd deep in the Ground and fastned together with Wattles The same Authority from the Scotch Historian who wrote the  Rota Temporum  tells us that  Hadrian  did first of all draw a Wall of a prodigious Bigness made of Turf of that Height that it look'd like a Mountain and with a deep Ditch before it From the Mouth of the  Tyne  to the River  Eske  i e from the  German  to the  Irish  Ocean This is supposed to have been done about the Year  THE  Cambd  Third Wall was built by  Lollius Urbicus  Lieutenant of Britain un∣der  Antoninus Pius  about the Year who by his great Success removed back the Bounds to where  Julius Agricola  had set them and raised a Wall there  THE  Cambd  Fourth Wall was that of  This Empe∣ror died at  York  about the Year    Feb th  Severus  which was built about the Year of Christ which extended from Sea to Sea quite cross the Island This was a Wall of Stone built much about the same Place where the Wall of  Hadrian  was It had it's Beginning at  Bulness  on the  Irish  Sea and crossing the Island went as far as  WallsEnd  a Village about Miles East of  Newcastle  A  Cambd  Fifth Wall was built between the two Arms or Bosoms of the Seas for many Miles together that where the Waters did not defend them the Wall might be a Security against the Incursions of the Enemy This Wall was made by  Carausius  Governour of  Britain  in the Reign of  Dioclesian  and stood in the same Place where  Lollius Urbicus  had built his  THIS being finished the  Romans  left the  Britains  to their own Valour and Conduct being called away for the Defence of  Gaul  But no sooner were they gone than their Enemies returned and slew all before them Up∣on this they sent Ambassadors to  Rome  to sollicite the Assistance of the  Ro∣mans  which was granted them For  Valentinian  sent three Companies under the Conduct of  Gallio  of  Ravenua  who routed the Enemy and relieved the Province After this  Cambd p  ex Gild'  they made a Wall of Stone not raised at the pub∣lick and private Costs as the other was with the Help of the poor Natives built after the usual Manner quite cross the Country from one Sea to ano∣ther by those Cities which were perhaps built there for fear of the Enemy They exhorted them to be couragious and left them Patterns to make their Weapons by Upon the Southren Shore of  Britain  also where their Ships  lay because the barbarous Enemy might enter there they built  Turrets  at some Distance from one another that lookt a long Way to the Sea And so the  Romans  intending never to return more about the Four Hundred Seventy Sixth Year from the coming of  Julius Caesar  took their last Farewell  THIS last Wall according to  Bede  was eight Foot broad and twelve Foot high and stood in the Place where the Walls of  Hadrian  and  Severus  had stood  Cambd  It had great Number of Towers or little  Castles  a Mile one from another called now  Castlesteeds  and on the Inside a Sort of  fortified little Towns  call'd  Chesters  The Inhabitants tell you there was also a  Brazen Trum∣pet  or  Pipe  whereof they now and then find Pieces so artificially laid in the Wall between each  Castle  and Tower that upon the Apprehension of Dan∣ger at any single Place by the sounding of it Notice might be given to the next then to the Third and so on  THESE are all the Walls of the  Romans  and that three of them went through this Town is something more than probable For  Severus  's Wall was in the Place of  Hadrian  's and the last Wall mentioned in the Place of  Severus  's and that last Wall went through this Town Mr  Camden  is so sure of this that he declares  'Tis most certain that the Rampier and afterward the Wall passed through this Town and that at  PandonGate  there still remains as 'tis Thought one of the little  Turrets  of that very Wall  There is indeed to this very Day a Part of that  Turret  in being above  PandonGate  which as the same Authority justly observed is different from the Rest both in Fashon and Masonry and undoubtedly carrys along with it a very great Age  NEAR this  Turret  is the  WallKnoll  a very ancient Place which our Hi∣storian  Grey  says positively  Was a Part of the PictsWall  and indeed the very Name of it speaks as much For the Word  Wall  upon the  Knoll  which signifies an  Hill  or  Eminence  cannot be understood of any other than the  Ro∣manWall  Because it had this Name from very ancient Times long before the Building of the  TownWall  to which it almost adjoins  A little above this Place is a  Tower  commonly call'd the  Vide  Wallknoll Tower  CarpentersTower  This was one of the  RomanTowers  as was very Visible before the taking down of the Upperpart of it  Lib de rebus Novo∣cast'  For it was of the same Size Model and Stone with the Tower of  This Village is now in the Possession of  John Ro∣gers  Esq  of  Newcastle  who has tur∣ned the inner Part of the Tower into Modern Rooms but left the Walls of it still intire  Rutchester  in  Northumberland  which was undoub∣tedly one of the  Roman Towers  by the  PictsWall  IT must also not be omitted that there is an ancient Tradition among the Inhabitants of this Town that the  RomanWall  went through the  WestGate  and the  Vicar's Garden  along that Ground where St  NicholasChurch  now stands along  NetherDeanBridge  by the  WallKnoll SallyPort  and so on to  WallsEnd  NOW to these Reasons and Authorities let us add what  Hollins De∣scrip of  Brit p  Hollinshead  says where he gives an Account of the Course of the  RomanWall  It begins he says at  Bolness upon Burgh  and so he brings it from Place to Place 'till he brings it to  Rutchester  then to  Heddon  then to  Wallbottle  then to  A small Vil∣lage about    Miles  West  from  Newca∣stle  belonging to  John Ro∣gers  Esq  Denton  and to  Newcastle  where it is thought St  Nicholas Church standeth  on the same  TO this I shall add the Authority of a Manuscript I am obliged to a very worthy  JohnMil∣bank  Esq  Gentleman for  Hadrian  built a Wall of Turff or Sods from the SeaSide beyond  Carlisle  unto  Tinmouth  It was demolished after he was gone and after him  Severus  built near the same a Wall of Stone and made Towers and Watching Places at every Miles End and a Passage all along by the Help of an  Horn  or such an Instrument that they might speak through the Wall and tell where the Enemy was This ended at the River of  Tyne  near  WallsEnd  This Authority goes on I my self have seen it at  Thirlwall  and it cometh by  Portgate  near  Stanchebank  by  Halton  near the  LongLane  where both the  Walls  are Apparent as also at  Denton  over  BonwellHill  down to  the  Westgate  And he also adds you may see it down the Hill by Mr  This House was in  Pil∣grimstreet  on the Westside a little before you come to  Sil∣verstreet  Leonard Carr  's House and over  WalkerMoor  to  It has been a Vulgar Er∣ror in many who from the Name  Walls∣end  have i∣magined that the Wall did actually end at that Vil∣lage but it could never have been so because that Place is half a Mile from the River Side It is therefore not presuma∣ble that the  Romans  would have begun or end∣ed the Wall but at the Side of the said River seeing all to the East∣ward of this Place the Ri∣ver was the Continuation of the  Prae∣tentura  or Fence from hindring the northerly In∣cursions The first Track is half a Mile South from  Wallsend  near  Cou∣sins  's House beginning a little to the East of it at the Side of the River  Tyne  and here certainly the st Station of  Segedunum  was originally placed For    Paces a saint Track of the Wall appears running North twelve Degrees and a half Westerly then forms an Angle Pointing south westerly for    Paces to the above∣mention'd Mansion of  Cousins  's House About    Paces West of this the  Fossa  begins to appear pretty distinct measuring about    Foot in Breadth and a little beyond it is the Foundation of the Stone Wall from hence it passes by a few Houses called the BeeHouses next through a small Village called  Walker  Here the  Fosta  is    Foot broad beyond which the Foundation of the  StoneWall  appears plain then it ascends the  BykerHill  run∣ing betwixt the Village of  Byker  and the Windmill thence going down the Hill passes through the  Euesburn  crossing the Rivulet there then I found it ascend the high Ground to the Westward of it passing by the Mansion House and through the Garden to the  RedBarnes  from thence it is visible through the Fields going Streight to the  SallyPort Gate  of  Newcastle Gordon Itiner Septent p  This Place where the End of the  Wall  is belongs to Mr  Henry Waters  of  Newcastle  WallsEnd  THUS I think it very clear that these  RomanWalls  went through this Town Let us now see what this Town was in these ancient Times  p  Mr  Cambden  gives his Opinion thus  Gateside  is commonly believed to be of grea∣ter Antiquity than  Newcastle  it self And if I should say further that this and  Newcastle  for they seem formerly to have been only one Town parted by the River were that FrontierGarrison which in the Times of the later Emperors was called  Gabrosentum  and defended by the  second Cohort of  the  Thraces  and that it retained it's old Name in a due Sense and Signification notwithstanding  this Newcastle  has changed it's Name once or twice I hope it will be no ways inconsistent with Truth For  Gaffr  is used by the  Britains  for a  Goat  and  Hen  in Composition for  Pen  which signifies an  Head  And in this very Sense and Meaning it is plainly called  Caprae Caput  or  GoatsHead  by our old Latin Historians  THUS far this learned Antiquary But notwithstanding this his Judgment and that no tollerable Reason can be brought against the two Places having been but one yet some will still have it that  Gateside  exclusive of  Newcastle  is the ancient  Gabrosentum  because of it's Name For my Part I cannot help being of Mr  Cambden  's Opinion and for this among other Reasons that if the Name of  Caprae Caput  discovers the  Gabrosentum  then it is more probable that the principal Part of it lay on the Northside of the River than on the South Because  Gabrosentum  was one of these  Frontier Garrisons  which lay  ad Lineam Valli  within the very Range of the Wall For all these Garrisons  ad Lineam Valli  were placed on the same Side of the River with the Wall it self consequently  Gateside  could but at most have been a Part of  Gabrosentum  and the meanest Part of it too a Sort of Suburbs to it as it actually was to this Town of  Newcastle  in the Reign of  Edward the Sixth  as shall be shown hereafter  BUT if this is not allowed and yet it must be allowed if  Gateside  has it's Name from the  Gabrosentum  yet most certainly it was a  Vide Chap  of the upper Parts of the Town  garrison'd Fort  in these very Times For still there is the Remains of a  Roman Turret  and the under Part of one of the  Roman  Towers to be seen and the Name of  Pandon  is no small Corroboration of the Truth of it as may be seen in our Account of that Place  THUS I think whatever is boasted of the Antiquity of  Gateside  it plainly appears that if  Caprae Caput  or  Gateside  Points out the ancient  Gabrosentum Newcastle  must be her elder Sister forasmuch as a Town must be earlier than it's Suburbs And if it does not  Newcastle  is by Mr  Cambden  called the old  Gabrocentum  where the d Cohort of the  Thracians  lay but according to the Course of the Forts in the  Notitia Imperii Gabrocentum  is the seventeenth Station on the Wall if therefore we follow the  Noticia  strictly  Newcastle  would rather seem to be the  PonsAelii  the d Station on the Wall where the  Cohort  of the  Cornovii  lay In this I have the concurring Opinion of the learned and judicious Antiquary Dr  Hunter  of  Durham Gord Itin Septent pag  The ancient  Orrhea  mentioned by  Ptolomy  has been thought by some to have been the Original of this Town but for what Reason I know not  Point it out it will then be a certain Con∣clusion that there is an indisputable Account of  this Town  in these very Times of the  Romans  which was some Hundreds of Years before  Caprae Ca∣put  or  Gateside  is mentioned by the most early of our Latin Historians  CHAP II  Of this TOWN after the Time of the  ROMANS  A  FTER the Departure of the  Romans  it seems to have chan∣ged it's Name as I shall shew immediately and probably by the latter Part of it's after Name  Monkchester  it was a Place of Defence or  Garrison'd Fort  during the Times of the  Saxons  and  Danes  This Name of  Monkchester  it retain∣ed 'till after the Conquest Thus we are told from  Simeon Dunelmensis  a Monk of the Church of  Durham  that  New∣castle  upon  Tyne  was anciently called  Monkchester civitas Monachorum  or the Town of the Monks not because it belong'd to the Monks but because the Monks of those Parts dwelt there  Ex Collect Mr  J Dou∣glas  SOME are of Opinion that  Newcastle  got it's Name of  Monkchester  because the Monks in Time of Danger came for Protection to it and not from their inhabiting it This is quite contrary to the Authority abovementioned and all others that I have met with Mr  Eachard  in his History of  England  says that  Monkchester  was so called from certain Monks who  lived there  in great  Austerity and Retirement and the  Monasticon  gives us the following Account In the Year there was a certain Man in the Province of the  Mercians  a Presbyter and Prior of the Monastery of  Winchelescumbe  who was a Monk whose Name was  Aldwin  This Man preferr'd a voluntary Poverty and Con∣tempt of the World to all it's Honours and Riches and having learned from the History of the  Northumbers  that that Land was formerly famous for Mul∣titudes of Monks and religious Men who tho' in the Flesh lived not accor∣ding to the Flesh but whilst they were on Earth had their Conversation in Heaven He desired greatly to visit the Monasteries of these Places tho' He knew they were forsaken and left desolate and there to lead a poor Life in Imitation of them Coming therefore as far as the Monastery of  Evesham  he made known his Purpose to certain of the Brethren upon which two of them associated with him one of them was named

and committed to him the Care of their Souls After this they set forward on their Journey a Foot having an Ass to carry their Books Necessaries and their Sacerdotal Vestments to celebrate divine Service in At length they came to  York  desiring of  Hugh  the Son of  Bal∣drick  who was then Sheriff  Ut eis du∣cem itineris inveniret us∣que locum qui Monkce∣ster i e Monacho∣rum civitas

procure them a Guide to  Monk∣chester  that is the City of the Monks which is now called  Newcastle  whi∣ther being brought by their Guide they staid awhile but found not any Remains of it's former Sanctity no Footsteps of the Religious People who had formerly  dwelt there Walcher  Bishop of  Durham  hearing of this sent for them and gave them the Monastery of  Jarray  which at that Time was unroof'd and had scarce any Thing remaining of it's ancient Grandeur  AND now how long it had been in this desolate Condition we may gather from  Mag Brit Nov An∣tiq ex  Hol∣bius  Hollingshead  By the Invasion of the  Danes  says he the Churches and Monasteries throughout  Northumberland  were so waisted and ruined that a Man could scarcely find a Church standing at this Time in all that Country and as for those that remained they were all covered with Broom or Thatch And as for any  Abby  or  Monastery  there was not one left in all the Country neither did any Man for the Space of  Two hundred Years  take Care for the repairing or building up of any Thing in Decay so that the People of this County knew not what a Monk meant And if they saw any they wonder∣ed at the Strangeness of the Sight One Place there was in this County fa∣mous for being the Habitation of Monks from whence it was called  Monk∣chester  but that also was so ruinated and destroy'd that when the Monks of  Mercia  the Monks mentioned before came to it they found no Token or Remnant of any Religions Persons who had had an Habitation there all was defaced and gone  NOW with respect to  Monkchester  this seems to be punctually true For as  Hollingshead  observes that it was about Years from the Ruin of the Mo∣nasteries to this Time after the Conquest  Anno  so it must be taken Notice of that the  Danes  in the Year  Hollin  which was the th of the Reign of King  Alured  divided themselves So that King  Haldon  with one Part there∣of went into  Northumberland  and lay in the Winter Season near  He sat down with his Men at  Tames∣mouth  which is be∣tween  Gate∣side  and  Whickham Sim Dunel'  to the River of  Tyne  where he divided the Country amongst his Men and remained there for the Space of two Years and oftentimes fetched thither Booties and Preys out of the Country of the  Scots  and  Picts  IT appears then from this that the Monasteries of  Monkchester  had been in Ruins about Years that is to say from the Year to the Year the Time of the Coming of the  Mercian  Monk  LET us now see if we can form any probable Conjecture when it was first inhabited by  Monks  and got the Name of  Monkchester  And this I imagine happen'd towards the later End of the th Century For in the Year the Monastical Life was brought in among the  Northumbers  by  Aidan  who was  that Year made Bishop of  Northumberland  and had his Seat at  Lindisfern  is a small I∣sland on the Northern Shore of  England  made only by swelling Tides for at Ebb it is joined to the main Land of  England  by a Ridge of sandy Earth It is as we are inform'd called the  HolyIsland  from it's first Bishop living in an Holy Society with his Clergy He dy'd  Aug  st  Anno  and was buried in the Church of  Lindisfern  He was succeeded by  Finan  a Monk of the Monastery of  Hy  who died  Feb  in the Year  Coleman  succeeded him and was Bishop about    Years But being worsted in the Controversy about the keeping of  Easter  he gave up his Bishoprick and left  Lindisfern Tuda  suc∣ceeded him and dy'd the same Year he was made After this the See was vacant fourteen Years and then fill'd up by  Eata  in the Year    who continued 'till the Year    being then chosen to the See of  Hagustald  He was succeeded by St  Cuthbert  who was consecrated at  York  by  Theodore  Archbishop of  Canterbury  upon  EasterDay  which happened  March  The Archbishop was assisted by seven other Bishops and King  Egfrid  and many of his Nobles were present When he had been Bishop about two Years he gave up his Charge and foreseeing his Death approaching he resigned his Bishoprick and re∣tired to his former Solitude the Island of  Fern  where he died in two Months Time viz  March  the th    and was buried at  Lindisfern Eadbert  was chosen after him he governed the See about ten Years and dy'd in the Year  Eadfrith  or  Egfrith  succeeded him who is said to have wrote a very fine Book with his own Hand containing the Gospels in Latin which  Ethelwold  his Successor adorned with Gilding and Jewels  Bilfrid  the Anchorite painted and  Aldred  the Priest enlarged with an interlineary Version in the Saxon Tongue My Authority says further that this very Book is still preserved in the  CottonLibrary  This famous Library had the Misfortune this last Year    to be set on Fire and part of it and its Manuscripts were burnt but we hope this valuable Piece of Antiquity has escape  This Bishop died  Anno  and was succeeded by  Ethelwold  after the See had been vacant near three Years He died in the Year  Keneuif  or  Kenulf  succeeded him the same Year who died in the Year  Henulf  was succeeded by  Higbaldus  who died  May  the twenty fifth  Ecgbert  succeeded him who was consecrated by

was in the Year    and there the See continu'd    Years This Bishop died in the Year    He was the first of the Bishops of  Lindisfern  that exercised Episcopal Authority over the See of  Hex∣am  which he did in the first Year that he settled at  Chester  The See of  Hexam  continued 'till the Reign of King  Henry  the first under the Jurisdiction of the Bishops of  Lindisfern  Eardulph  was succeeded by  Cutheard  who died in the Year  Tilred  succeeded him and died in the Year  Tilred  was succeeded by  Wigred  who died in the Year  Wigred  was succeeded by  Uhtred  who sat above    Years  Senhelm  succeeded him who seems to have been removed from his Bishoprick in the year    He was succeeded by  Aldred  who died in the year  Aldred  was succeeded by  Elffig  who is also call'd  Ellfinus  who died in the year  Aldwin  succeeded him and in the year    was obliged to remove the Body of St  Cuthbert  and the Clergy that were with him from  Chester  to  Rippon  because of the  Danes  But Things becoming peaceable again they left that Place about four Months after their coming thither In their Return they passed through  Durham  which at this Time was a Place wild and not habitable being all a Wood full of thick Bushes and Trees saving only a little Plain upon the Top of the Hill which was wont to be sowed and is the very Place where now the  Church  standeth and were mightily taken with the Situation of it Here  Aldwinus  first deposited the Body of St  Cuthbert  and resolved to make this Place his Episcopal Seat Having therefore grubb'd up the Wood he began to build a Church of Stone  Mag Britt p ex Godwin  and Houses about it for his Company The  Governour  of  Northumberland  then named  Uthred  and the People from the River  Coqued  to the  Tees  came in so rea∣dily to his Assistance and continued their Help so long that the Wood was soon grubbed up and the Church and Houses finished insomuch that  Aldwin  dedicated the Church in the d year after he began the Work upon  Sept  the th This was the Beginning of the Church and City of  Durham  or  Dunhelm  more properly which takes it Name from  Dun  which signifies a Mountain and  Holm  a

Honour no great while for in    Months time he died He was succeeded by  Egelric Anno  who built a Church at  Chester  upon the Street in Me∣mory that the Bishops of  Lindisfern  had rested themselves there together with the Body of St  Cuthbert  years during the Time of the  Danish  Wars He resign'd in the year    and was succeeded by  Egelwyn  who died in the year  Walter  or  Walcher  succeeded

Porches and Allies leading round it  afterwards in the Time of Bishop  Acca  that Bi∣shop superadded to the Buildings of his Church many Decorations and curious Works he got from all Parts some Relicks of the  Apostles  and  Martyrs  and erected several  Altars  in Reverence to them and for that End made distinct  Porches  in the Walls of the Church He also with great Diligence and no small Charge gathered the Histories of of their Sufferings with many Volumes of Ecclesiastical Writers and of them he made a very large Library He also provided several sacred Utensils as  Flaggons Cups Pattens Candlesticks  and other Vessels of the like Nature which belong to the Service of God He also brought a  famous Chorister  who had been taught to sing in the Church of  Canterbury  whose Name was  Maban  to instruct those of his Church of  Hexam Mag Brit ex Bed lib c  He is also said to have gilded the Walls with Gold and Silver and covered the Altars with Purple and Silk  That Part of this Church which is now standing for the West End of it is intirely demolished is still grand and noble and speaks what it was in ancient Days About    years ago it was repair'd by Contribution no

Churches gives us the following Account That Privilege which I read to have been granted unto the Church of the once eminent Monastery of  Hagulstad  is very re∣markable That is there were  Crosses  set up at a certain Distance from the Church in the four Ways leading thereto Now if any Malefactor flying for Refuge to that Church was taken or Ap∣prehended within the  Crosses  the Party that took or laid hold on him there did forfeit  Two hun∣dredh in Hundredh viii Librae continentur  If he took him within the Town then he forfeited  Four Hundredh  if within the Walls of the Church Yard then  Six Hundredh  if within the Church then  Twelve Hundredh  if with∣in the Doors of the Quire then  Eighteen Hundredh  besides Penance as in case of Sacriledge but if he presum'd to take him out of the  Stone Chair  near the Altar called  Fridstol  or from amongst the Holy Relicks behind the  Altar  the Of∣fence was not redeemable with any Sum but was then become  sine emendatione Botolos  i e

stately and magnificent and by far exceeding any Thing in that Town It is now inhabited by Sir  Edward Blacket  Bart but is the Property of  Walter Blacket  Esq  Among the eminent Persons of this Place I meet with two in particular  Stephen ad∣dit Vol p  The st is  John  of  Hexam  born in that Place and first Monk then Prior of the Monastery there He was a Man grave modest meek courteous assable yet severe and rigid in punishing the Faults of those under his Charge learned and eloquent and a diligent Searcher of History and Antiquities and tho' he taught Philosophy and Divi∣nity publickly in his Monastery yet in private He as much as Time would permit read Historians and particularly venerable  Bede  He made an Addition of    Years to the History of  Simeon  of  Durham  beginning at the th Year of King  Henry  the d and proceeding to the first of King  Richard  calling it an History of    Years He also writ of Signs and Comets A Discription of the  Scottish  War Sermons and some other Things and flourish'd in    The other is  Richard  of  Hexam  first Monk and then Prior of that Monastery educated there in Monastical and School Learning and in all Sorts of Piety so diligently imitated his Master  John  Prior of that Place that he suc∣ceeded him in that Employment and in Teaching When made Prior he in all Things most exactly copy'd after his said Master for tho' he in publick taught his Brethren Philosophy and Divinity yet in private he read History and accu∣rately writ the Affairs of his Time especially in  England  by the Titles  The Actions of King Stephen The Acti∣ons of King Henry the d and proceeding to the st of King Richard The War of the Standard A short Chro∣nicle from Adam to Henry the Emperor Of the State and Bishops of the Church of Hexam  He died and was buried in his Monastery about the year    Hexam  was made a Bishoprick in the Year and had  Eata  for its first Bishop Churches and Monasteries were built in several Places and Religion  flourished in this whole Kingdom This Account  Hollingshead  gives in the following Words Great Numbers of Persons daily offered themselves to be baptized insomuch that within the Space of Days as is left in Writing  Aidan  christned Thousand Persons of the which no small Part forsaking the World betook themselves to a Solitary kind of Life Thus by continual Preaching the Gospel in that Country it came to pass in the End that the Faith was generally received of all the People and such Zeal to advance the Christian Religion daily increased amongst them that no where could be found greater Hereupon were no small Number of Churches built in all Pla∣ces abroad in those Parts by Procurement of King  Oswold  all Men liberally consenting according to the rated Substance to be Contributors towards the Charges By this Means the Kingdom of the  Northumbers  flourish'd as well in Fame of Increase of Religion as also in civil Policy and prudent Ordinances  When now it is considered that the Business of Religion went on so Brisk∣ly throughout the whole Kingdom of the  Northumbers  it is rational to sup∣pose that this Place as it was not only convenient for the monastical Life as to Retirement but also a Security to it too being at that Time a garrison'd Fort was certainly as early inhabited by the Monks as the abovementioned Time and besides if we consider the Veneration it is mention'd with by many Historians for the severe rigid Lives of it's Monks how it was the most emi∣nent Place in the North for the monastical Life so very famous on that ac∣count as to change it's former Name to that of  Monkchester  There can scarce be allowed it a later Time to arrive at such a Pitch of Eminency and Glory Before the Name of  Monkchester  I imagine from it's being a Place of For∣tification that it had the Name of  Chester  as  Weremuth  was the original Name of that Place but was afterwards called  Monkweremuth  from the Monks inha∣biting there It seems all along to have been a Place of Defence and Fortifi∣cation It was the Ancient  Gabrosentum  according to Mr  Cambden  or as o∣thers more justly imagine the  Pons Aelii  of the  Romans  was a garrison'd Fort 'till inhabited by the Monks and was such from the Time of the Monks 'till the Conquest  THE Name of  Monkchester  continued 'till the Building of the Castle and after that from the Building of it it got the Name of  Newcastle  The Oc∣casion of which was this  Malcolme  King of  Scotland  having entred with his Army into the Confines of  England  came with it into  Northumberland  and waisted and plundered the whole Country as far as the River  Tyne  the Con∣queror being all the while in  Normandy  and also his Son  Robert Curtois  But no sooner were the King and his Son come into  England  than  Robert  was sent with an Army against  Malcolme  to drive him out of the Country The  Scots  being appriz'd of this retir'd into their own Country and  Robert  with his Army encamp'd upon the Banks of the  Tyne  where he built the  Castle  to de∣fend these Northern Parts from the Incursions of the  Scots  for the  Mag Brit p Poly virg c  Future The Chronicle of  Mailros  says that the Conqueror sent his Son  Robert  into  Scotland  against  Malcolme  in the Year who having done nothing up∣on his return built the  Newcastle  From hence it is easy to conclude that the Castle was founded the same Year towards the latter End of it For  Dugdale  tells us in his  Monasticon  that  Anno Do∣mini MLXXX Rex Williel∣mus Autum∣nali Tempo∣re Rober∣tum Fillium suum contra Malcomum misit sed cum perve∣nisset ad Eg∣glesbreth nullo conse∣cto negotio reversus Ca∣stellum No∣vum super flumen Ty∣nae condidit  Dug Mon Tom    p    King  William  in the Year about the Time of Autumn sent his Son  Robert  into  Scotland  against  Malcolme  But having got as far as  Egglesbreth  he returned having done no Exploit and built the  Newcastle  upon the River  Tyne  THUS the Town lost it's Name of  Monkchester  for that of  Newcastle  which it retains to this Day But however by the building of the Castle it lost nothing else for the Building of the said Castle did not destroy or take away the Right or Interest which the Townsmen had before but that still remained as before  AFTER this the Town grew more populous and increas'd in Trade and Wealth had great Privileges granted them by the Kings built Churches Monasteries Walls Bridges  c  as shall be seen in the following Treatise  CHAP III  Of the  WALLS  of this TOWN  N  EW CASTLE  is seated on the Northern Bank of the Ri∣ver  Tyne  and is bounded on the East by the Land of  By∣ker  on the West by the Lands belonging formerly to the  Prior of Tinemouth  on the North by the Lands of  Kenton  and  Coxlodge  and on the South by the County of  Durham  IT is surrounded with a  StoneWall  which at the Time it was built and for many Ages after was undoubtedly of very great Strength This has several Gates belonging to it  Round Towers  and  Square Turrets  which shall by and by be considered On the Outside of it is a Ditch or Trench and on the Inside it is ramper'd with Earth  Grey  THE Cause of Building this great Wall was the often Invasion of the  Scots  into this Place and Country they continually infested it and the rich Monasteries in these Northern Parts the religious Houses of this Town and the adiacent Places being above Forty  SOME are of Opinion that the Walls were begun in the Reign of  King Henry the Third  But the Author just now mentioned imagines Them to have been earlier King  John  he says gave great Priviledges to this Town and probably the  Newgate  and Walls thereabout were built in his Time the North Part of the Wall being the oldest and of another Fashion than the other Walls  IN the Reign of King  Henry  the d the same Author says the West part of the Wall was built but I am rather inclined to believe that that Part of the Wall was not built 'till the Reign of  Edward the st  The Wall from  the Time it was begun went on but slowly 'till this Reign when an Acci∣dent hapned which revived the former Fears of the TownsMen and put them in Mind of the neglected Wall which 'till that Time had got no far∣ther than  EverTower  as appears by the old Part of the Wall ending there∣abouts The Accident was this  Cambden  in the Reign of  Edward  the st a very  rich Burgher  being carried off a Prisoner by the  Scots  out of the Middle of the Town first paid a round Ransom himself and afterwards began the st For∣tifications of the Place  IT is true that this Accident was the Occasion of carrying on the Wall but Mr  Cambden  is mistaken in saying it occasioned the Beginning of it For it was begun some Years before the Reign of  Edward the st  For from  New∣gate  to the  EverTower  as has just now been observed is a Work older and vastly different from what the Wall is from  EverTower  towards the  Westgate  This Wall leading to the  Westgate  was it which was begun in the Reign of  Edward  the st for in this Reign it was when Leave was granted to the preaching Friers to break out that  Little Gate  which now leads into the  WardensClose  then their Garden that this Wall was called the  Vid Dur∣hamTower  and  BlackFriers  NewWall  and surely a NewWall will imply that there was an Old one before was the thing itself not still a Matter of Fact as it really is to any Observer  HOW long the Walls were a Building or who they were in particular that contributed towards the Building of them is a Matter pretty much in the Dark However 'tis  Gardiner chap  This Au∣thor whose Name was  Ralph Gar∣diner  liv'd at  Chirton  a Village East of  Newca∣stle  near the Town of  Shields  which Village is now in the Possession of  Rob  t  Law∣son  and  Ed∣ward Col∣lingwood  Esqrs He was a bitter Enemy to this Town and did all the Mischief to it that lay in his Power as appears in every Page of his Book In which are Numbers of Falsities  supposed that King  Edward the st  was a Contri∣butor to them The Names of some of the RoundTowers also give us some Light which to this Day do seemingly bear the Names of their ancient Foun∣ders which may in some Measure occasion a Guess at the Time of their Buil∣ding  THE Town after the compleating of the Walls was divided into  Wards  according to the Number of the Gates and round Towers in the Wall which Towers and Gates were wont be defended in Times of Hostili∣ty with the  Scots  by the particular Wards appropriated to them  THE st Gate I shall begin with is the  Closegate  which is so called be∣cause it stands in a narrow Street called the Close it had in Ward from the  Closegate  upon the  Southrawe  so going Eastward unto the  Javilgrippe  but nothing of  Javilgrippe  then going Westward upon the North unto the  Closegate  FROM the  Closegate  there are Stairs leading up to a  RoundTower  called the  WhiteFryerTower  This Tower had in Ward from the Eastend of  Bailiffgate  opposite to the  Javilgrippe  with all that dwell upon the  HighStairs  in the  Close  unto and with the Westside of these  Stairs  that lead unto the  SouthPostern  of the  Castle  with all  Javilgrippe  Eastward and from the  Javilgrippe  to the Southrawe of the Close and with all the  BridgeEnd  THIS Tower with the Wall leading to the  little Gate  commonly called the  Posterngate  but originally the Gate of the  WhiteFryers  or  WhiteFryergate  were together with the Gate itself probably built by the  WhiteFryers  for the  WhiteFryers  were situated in the Southwestend of the Street of  Westgate  in the same Grounds were are now the Houses of Mr  Anderson George Grey  Esq  and others And as it is reasonable to believe that what∣ever  Religious House  or  Nobleman  built a Tower or Piece of the Wall that it would be built chiefly for their own Security so the Buildings now mentioned being so situated as I have just now observed are a Proof that the  WhiteFryers  were the Founders And if it be considered that the  WhiteFryers  were  See  WhiteFryers  founded by King  Edward  the st in whose Reign the abovementioned Accident happened which occasioned a fresh Beginning of Building of the Wall it will appear still more probable that these  Fryers  were the Builders It may indeed be said that as they were sounded in this  Reign it can't be imagin'd they had sufficient Riches for such an Un∣dertaking This is readily granted but when it is considered that these  Fry∣ers  were newly founded by King  Edward  the st that they were the first of that Order that had been in this Place that they were  Carmelites  or original∣ly coming from Mount  Carmel  in  Syria  and that the Prayers of all Monaste∣ries were thought more particularly available for the Souls in Purgatory it will follow I think rationally that they were more able  then  to do such a Thing by getting the Contributions of others than they could have been of themselves Years after The Name given to these Walls is also another Argument it is more probable that the  WhiteFryerTower  the  Wall  and  Gate  now mentioned were so called as other Towers were from their Foun∣ders than from their bare Situation For the Walls behind the  BlackFryers  are not called after their Name because they were not built by them but by King  Edward  the st as shall be shewn below  THIS Tower is now the  MeetingHouse  or  Hall  of the Company of Ma∣sons  GREY  in mentioning the Ports or Gates of  Newcastle  says there were be∣sides  These PosternGates  belonging to the  Religious Houses  I have met with no more than three and this  WhiteFriersgate  is undoubtedly one of them It seems to be much of the same Kind with that which leads into the  Warden'sClose  It has been an Outlet to the Fryers that they might walk to the  Forth  and the  neighbouring Fields  and that it might be of Use and Service to the  Castle  in Times of Hostility with the  Scots  I imagine it was out at this Gate that the  Townsmen  made that famous Sally mention'd by  Grey  who says that in the Reign of  Edward  the d  See a more perfect Ac∣count in the Year of the Mayors    Three hundred valiant Men issued out of the Town through a  Posterngate  and came suddenly in the Night up∣on a great Army of the  Scots  which lay in the West Part of the Town and raised the Army put them to flight and took Earl  Murray  Prisoner in his Tent and others  THE next Round Tower to  WhiteFryergate  is  DentonTower  or  NevilTower  which had in Ward all the  HairyHugh  on the South Side of the  WhiteFryers  with all the Houses standing there upon the  Burnbank  betwixt the  FryerKirk  and a Burne unto the Stone Bridge in  Bailiffgate  with all  Bailiffgate  upward that same Rawe unto  DentonChare  with  DentonChare  WHY it was called  DentonTower  I can give no Reason unless it was from it's having in Ward the Lane called  DentonChare  but it has the Name of  NevilTower  from the  Nevil  Family of  Raby  who built it which Family was honoured with the Title of  Earl  in the Reign of  Richard  the d  Ralph Nevil  Lord of  Raby  being created  Earl  of  Westmoreland  in the st of that Reign His House in  Westgate  called  Westmorelandplace  which shall be con∣sidered when we treat of that Street had this Tower built behind it for it's Security and Defence The Tower is now the Hall of the  Wallers Bricklayers  and  Plaisterers  and was repair'd by them  Anno Dom'    Richard Flet∣cher  and  William Johnson  Wardens  THE next Round Tower is  WestspittleTower  which had in Ward the  Side

ancient Custom And the Ordinance therein was to be devised by Their  Wardens  when the Hour was assigned upon Pain to lose and forfeit one  Pound of Wax  to be applied to the Use of the whole Fellowship of the said Occupations The best Account I have met with of these kind of Plays is of one that was play'd in the City of  Coventry  Step st V p  Before the Suppression of Monasteries the City of  Coventry  was very famous for the Pageants that were played therein upon  Corpus Christi  Day which occasioning very great Confluence of People to it from far and near was of no small Benefit thereto which Pageants being acted with migh∣ty State and Reverence by the  FranciscanFryers  had Theatres for the several Scenes very large and high placed upon Wheels and drawn to all the emi∣nent  Parts of the City for the better Advantage of Spectators and contain'd the Story of the old and new Testament compos'd into old English Rhimes as appears by an ancient Manuscript entitl'd  Ludus

FicketTower  Eastward  THE Tower next to this Gate is that in the Corner of the  Carliol Croft  now the Hall of the  Weavers  who repair'd it  Anno  It got it's Name very probably from it's Founder For the  Carlills  or  Carliols  were seve∣ral  of them Magistrates of  Newcastle  and as this appears probable from the Name so it is also equally probable that the Founder of this Tower had his House somewhere at the Head of  Pilgrimstreet  nigh his own Tower as  Ne∣vel  's Tower was behind his House and that the Field called vulgarly  Carling Croft  had it's Name of  Carliol Croft  being at that Time of Day the Property of this Founder The last Mayor of this Town of that Name before the Completion of the Walls was  Nicholas de Carliol  in the d Year of  Edward  the d so that this Tower could not be much later in Building to say the least of it's Antiquity imaginable but it is rather probable it was built a good while earlier It has to Ward all the East Raw of  Pilgrimstreet  within

Perambulation called the  ShieldsField  and a Way to a Village called  Wallsend  is a Village Fast from  Newcastle  about three Miles nigh it was the Station of the st Cohort of the  Fraxagi  as the  Liber notitiarum  says which calls the Place itself  Vindobola  or as  Antoninus  names it  Vindomora  which last seems in the Pro∣vincial Language of the  Britons  to have signified the  Wallsend  as the later does the  Rampier'send  For they anci∣ently named a Wall  Mur  and a Ditch or Rampier  Gual  or  Val  or  Bal  Cambden  But with this a late ingenious Author cannot agree because Mr  Cambden  brings no Proof from Inscriptions and also because  Pancirolus  in the same  Notitia  places  Vindomora  at the ninth Station  per Lineam Valli  where the fourth Cohort of the  Galli  lay and which appears by Inscriptions to have been the  Little Chesters upon the Wall  He con∣cludes therefore that where the Wall begun which has already been shown the first Station of  Segedunum  was cer∣tainly placed  Gord Irinerar Septontion p  The present  Walsend  is a very agreeable Place having about it very good Grounds and in it some beautiful Houses and Gardens Some of the Possessors of which are Mr  Henry Waters  of  Newcastle  Hoastman Mr  Charles Atkin∣son  of  Newcastle  Hoastman Mr  Thomas Waters  of  Newcastle  Merchant Mr  James Monkcaster  of  New∣castle  Merchant Mr  William Dixon  of  Newcastle  Brewer  c  There is a Chapel belonging to this Village which is very inconveniently situated on the Top of an Hill the present Incumbent is the Reverend Mr  Thomas Dockwray  Lecturer of St  Nicholas  in  Newcastle  Walsend  by  Bede Villa ad Murum  This is cer∣tainly a Mi∣stake For according to Mr  Camb∣den  that was  Walltown  which from the a∣greeableness of the Name and as he goes on it's    Miles Dist∣ance from the Eastern Sea was the  Roy∣al Burrow  which  Bede  calls  ad mu∣rum  But the learned Dr  Smith  upon this Passage of  Bede  is of another Opi∣nion He says it is commonly supposed to be  Walton  but this he adds can't be true For it answers not the Di∣stance at which  Bede  places the  ad murum  from the Sea But  Wallbottle  both as to it's Name and as to it's Di∣stance which is not far from  New∣castle  and from the Sea about    Mi∣les will an∣swer exactly well  But be this is it will certain it is that the  ad murum  is fa∣mous on Ac∣count that  Si∣gebert  King of the  EastSaxons  and  Penda  King of the  Mer∣cians  toge∣ther with his whole Train of Courtiers and Atten∣dants were baptised in it by the Bishop  Finanus  One  Matilda  of this Village of Wallsend had some Lands in  Pampeden  confirmed to her at a Court held at  Byker Anno  In a Charter of  William de Carilepho  Bishop of  Durham  which he granted to the Monks we have menti∣on made of this Place For the Bishop is said to have given this and  Willington  to the Monks  Ultra ampnem Ti∣nam duas villas  Wyllynton    Walleshend  cum suis Appendiciis  and so into  Tinemouthshire  This

unto  Pandon  Burn from  Pandonyate  to the  Sandgate  either in  Pandon  or  Fishergate  or in other Places from the said Burn Eastward with the Wards with all that dwell upon North Rawe in  Sandgate  THIS Tower commonly called the  Carpenters  Tower because the Com∣pany of Carpenters or Shipwrights meet in it was one of the Towers of the  Old Romans  This Company in the Year built upon the under Part of it a very grand and stately  SquareTower  adorn'd at the Top Cor∣ners with  fair Turrets  built in the form of a Lanthorn  Lib de Reb Novocast'  BUT before the taking down the Top of the old Tower it was much of the same Size Model and Stone with the Tower of  Routchester  in  Northum∣berland  which was certainly one of the Towers belonging to the  PictsWall  THERE is under it an ancient Posterngate which leads into the Field called the  GarthHeads  the most part of which was last Year enclosed and turned into Gardenground by  Richard Ridley  Esq  the Owner of it  FROM  Sandgate  which is so called because it was built upon the Sand or the Riverside is a Wall having many little Gates in it extending itself as far as the  Merchant  's Hall along the Street called the  Keyside  IT must not be forgot what is mentioned in the Manuscript of Mr  John Milbank  that between every one of these Towers there were for the most Part  WatchTowers  made square with the Effigies of Men cut in Stone up∣on the Tops of them as tho' they were  watching  and they were called  Gar∣ret  which had Square Holes over the Walls to through Sones down  WHEN these Walls were finished is not exactly found  Grey  Grey  seems to think they were finished some little Time before the Reign of  Henry  the th  BUT this I imagine is a Date too late for the finishing of them for  Henry  the th in the th Year of his Reign  Aug  granted at the Castle of  Porttefract  that all Fines Redemptions Amerciaments Issues Forfeitures and Profits as well of Pleas as that of Justices of the Peace  c  be received by the  Mayor  and  Burgesses  of this  Town  and their  Officers  for supporting amending and repairing the  Walls Bridges  and  Gates of the Town  The Walls then in this Reign must have been compleated forasmuch as they then probably wan∣ted Repairs  BUT further had  Grey  remembered his own Story abovemention'd of the  valiant Men  that issued out at the  Whitefryergate  and put the  Scottish Army  to flight he would surely have concluded that the Walls were finished before that Accident which hapned in the Reign of  Edward  the d Certain∣ly the  Scottish  Army which is said to have been a great one would not have  lodged without the Town if they could have lodged in it and what should hinder their lodging in it but the Walls of the Town well guarded I con∣clude therefore that the Walls of the Town at the latest were compleated in the Reign of King  Edward  the d before the Year for it was in this Year that this Transaction hapned  AFTER they were finished it  Grey  was famous for being a Bullwark against the  Scots  all the Power of  Scotland  could never win it but of late  viz  in the Time of the Civil Wars being assisted by the  English  it was stormed and our Churches and Houses defaced and the Ornaments of both taken away  IT is now going fast into Ruins several of the  Turrets  and some of the  round Towers  being fallen but the Towers which stand together with some lit∣tle Parts of the Wall adjoining to them are kept in good Repair by their respective Companies  THE Circumference of this Wall from the  Closegate  to the same is two Miles and Yards  CHAP IV  WESTGATE  T  HIS Street has it's Name from it's being on the West Part of the Town  FROM the Gate Eastward is a Little Street called  RattenRawe  at the End of which is a narrow Passage turning up to the North which leads to the Monastery of the  BlackFryers  Sect I  Of the  BLACKFRYERS  THE  Dominicans  commonly called  BlackFryers PreachingFryers  and  Ja∣cobine Fryers  came over into  England  in the Year of our Lord  Fuller C Hist  or as others say and had their first Residence in  Oxford  they were a  Prior  and  Brethren  their Prior's Name was  Gilbert de Fraxineto  the Name of the Order was taken from St  Dominick  born at  Cologona  in  Spain  Of this Order were no sewer than fourscore famous English Writers  De reb Novocast'  This Monastery was founded by Sir  Peter Scott  who was the first Mayor of  Newcastle Anno  and Sir  Nicholas Scott  his Son who was one of the Bailiffs of the Town and  Capital Bailiff  but the Site of it was given by Sisters whose Names have long since been ingratefully buried in Oblivion  WHEN was the particular Time of it's Building I have met with no Ac∣count but it is not difficult to give a probable Guess the Order itself of the  Dominicans  or  BlackFryes  came into  England  as is mentioned above in the Year consequently it must have been founded after that Time And that it must have been founded some Years before the Year is plain to a Demonstration For in that Year which was the Eight of  Edward  the First the  BlackFryers  had Licence from the King to break a Door through this  New Wall  Vid  Town Wall  into their Garden which proves them a regular settled Body at that Time and therefore that their Priory was built some Years before that Licence  BlackFryers  Grey  WE are told that this Monastery was in old Time called the  GreyFryers  which in my Opinion is a Thing highly Improbable for the  GreyFryers  or  Franciscans  came not into  England  'till about the Year and if as I have proved above the  Blackfryers  were a Settled Body some Years before the Year how is it possible to have been called of old Time the  GreyFryers  This is therefore a Mistake and beside the  Dominicans  came into  England  be∣fore the  Franciscans  or  GreyFryers  and therefore more probably were sooner in this Place  IT has been a very stately and Beautiful Building as appears by the present Remains of it The  Area  or  Grassplat  is about Foot in Length and as many in Breadth on the East Side of it was the  Chapel  which is now the  Hall  of the Company of  Smiths  in this Town On the Westside of it is a curious  Old Well  which served the Monastery with Water called our  Lady's Well  On the South may still be seen the Ruins of a curious Front on which Side is the  Hall  of the  Cordwainers  in which I saw a Pair of winding Stairs which they told me before they were walled up led by a Vault as far as the Nunnery of St  Bartholomew  On the North of it were their  Gardens  a Part of which was the  Warden  's  Close  before the Building of that Part of the  Townswall  This appears by the Charter granted to this Monastery in the Reign of  Edward the first  about breaking out that  NarrowGate  in the Wall between  Westgate  and  Newgate  in which Grant it is said that the Wall went through the Middle of their Garden This Monastery was dependant upon the Priory of  Tinmouth  IN the Reign of  Edward  the d the Brethren of this Monastery had Li∣cense granted them for the Building of a  Drawbridge  beyond the  New Ditch  of the  Castle  WHO were the  Priors  of this Monastery what eminent Men belonged to them or what Things were transacted by them from their Beginning 'till their Dissolution were Things undoubtedly preserved among themselves whilst they were a Body but after their Surrender were either destroy'd or have not yet come to Light  ONE of the Priors of this Monastery was one  Richard Marshall  I take this Gentleman to have been the last  Prior  of this Monastery for in the th of  Henry  the th a Grant of a Tenement nigh the WhiteCross signed by Fryer  Richard Marshal  Dr and Prior and Fryer  David Simpson  and Fryer  John Sowrby  was given to  Anthony Godsave  upon his paying to the said Pri∣ory or Monastery  s  per Ann This Grant is now in the Possession of Mr  Thomas Marshal  of  Newcastle  Joyner who purchased this Tenement and has lately rebuilt it He pays the same Rent to the Town of  Newcastle  which the Tenement pay'd to the Monastery  ABOUT Years after the Signing of this Deed in  January  the th of this Reign this Monastery surrendered it consisted of a  Prior  and  Twelve Fryers  THE Nature of surrendering was this according to Bishop  Burnet  who says  Burnet  's Records p  at the surrendring of Monasteries and Abbies  c  there was generally a Confession along with the Surrender Few of them are remaining the fol∣lowing one is one of the Six the Bishop had seen and is a Copy from him  Pag    Coll Rec  FORASMUCH as we the  Prior  and  Fryers  of this House of  Carmelites  in  Stamford  commonly called the  WhiteFryers  in  Stamford  in the Coun∣ty of  Lincoln  do profoundly consider that the Perfection of Christian living doth not consist in same Ceremonies wearing of a  White Coat  disguising of our selves after strange Fashions Dockying and Becking wearing Scapulars and Hoods  and other like papistical Ceremonies wherein we have been most principally practised and Noseled in Time past but the very true Way to please God and to live a true Chri∣stian Man without all Hypocrysie and feigned Dissimulation is sincerely declared to us by our Master Christ his Evangelists and Apostles being minded hereafter to follow the same conforming ourselves to the Will and Pleasure of our Supreamehead under God on Earth the King's Majesty and are not to follow henceforth the superstitious Traditions of any Forensecal Potentate or Power with mutual Assent and Consent do submit ourselves unto our said Sovereign Lord and with the like Assent and Con∣sent do surrender  c Sign'd by the  Prior  and  Six Fryers  WHAT became of the Brethren of this our Fryery after their Surrender what they had allowed them annually for a Maintenance or whether they had any Thing allowed at all I have no where met with Some Account indeed I meet with afterwards of the  Prior  himself but none of the  Fryers  It is this which follows  Collier Eccl Hist Vol II p  RICHARD Marshal  Prior of the  BlackFryers  in  Newcastle  about the Year went into  Scotland  and preach'd at St  Andrews  that the  Pater Noster  should be addressed to God and not to the Saints Some Doctors of the  University  being disgusted at this Assertion prevailed with one  Tofts  a  GreyFryer  to undertake to prove that the  PaterNoster  might be said to the  Saints  whose Ignorance in doing the same was so manifest that he became the common Jest and quitted the Town  AFTER the Surrender of the Monastery on  Jan  the th th of  Henry  the th the  BlackFryers  was granted to the Town of  Newcastle  in Conside∣ration of  l    s    d  The annual Value of it was  l    s    d  The King says in the Grant that He gives to the  Mayor  and  Burgesses  of  Newcastle  the whole House and Site lately a  Priory  or a  House of Bre∣thren  called vulgarly the  BlackFryers  in  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  The  Chapel Houses Edifices Gardens  c the  Hall  two  Chambers  a Chamber called the  CrossChamber  and the two  Gardens  with their Appurtenances and the whole Close within the  Westgate  and another Close near the Site of the said Priory on the North And a Close containing Acres and a House in the same Close without the Walls of the said Town and a House called the  Gatehouse  situated near the Street  IT also appears from the Grant that the King reserved to himself and Suc∣cessors the  Bells  and  Lead  that was upon the Church belonging to this Fryery and the other Buildings of it the Lead in the Gutters together with the Stones and Iron of the Church  c  THE Nine Crafts of this Town had their  Meetinghouses  or  Halls  in it and still have except two of them the  Taylors  and the  Cordwainers  who have be∣stowed these upon some poor Widows and got themselves others in other Places These Halls are of great Service to this ancient Building in preserv∣ing it from an entire Ruin Such is the Hall of the  Smiths

Harrison Thomas Dixon William Slaiter  then Wardens  BY Means of these Halls there is still some Visage of the Fryery remain∣ing which had otherwise been intirely in the Dust 'Tis a Pity that those People who are permitted by the Companies to reside in some of those Rooms are not threatned into more Cleanliness and that the Companies themselves are not at the Expence of repairing the Area were these Things done it would be a Beautiful Piece of Antiquity and an Entertainment to the Cu∣rious from whencesoever they came  Sect II  The  VICARAGE  IN coming back by the narrow Lane which led to the  Blackfryers  we face a little Street called  Fennel Street  which leads into  Westgate  a Street more retired than any other in this Town there being no Artificers or Me∣chanicks in this Street nor any Market It is chiefly inhabited by the  Clergy  and  Gentry  and indeed it seems all along to have been inhabited by such more than by others In some Writings above Years old we meet with the Names of some  Clergymen  who lived in this Street  viz Robertus de Gonwerton Thomas Abelot c  not to mention those who belonged to the Monasteries and Hospitals and  Grey  tells us that the Men who lived in this Street in his Time had Employment for both Town and Country he says also that in old Time the Earl of  Westmoreland  had his House in this Street  AT present several of the Houses in it are large and beautiful such are the Houses of the Lady  Clavering  of  Utrick Whitfield  Esq  Thomas Ord  Esq  Mr  Abraham Dixon  c in the Upper Part of it and of  George Grey  Esq  and others adjoining to him in the lower Parts of it  ON the North Side of this Street a little above St  John  's Church is the  Vicarage  House the Dwelling of the  Vicars  of  Newcastle  It stands at least e∣qually pleasant with the other Houses in this Place being situated in the mid∣dle of Fields and Gardens and more retir'd being at some Distance from the Street  WHO it was that built this House I have not been able to learn but 'tis not improbable that it was the Town of  Newcastle  who has been al∣ways famous for it's Generosity to it's Clergy as the Vicarage itself in par∣ticular must always acknowledge It is at present more beautiful and conve∣nient than it was wont to be having been repair'd and enlarged in the Year by the Rev and Worthy Dr  Ellison  the then  Vicar  THERE is a  Hall  belonging to this House built in a very grand and state∣ly Manner according to the Hospitality of the Times it was built in In particular it was the Place where the  Vicars  of  Newcastle  were wont to en∣tertain the inferiour Officers of Churches the  Clarks Sextons c  at the Season of  Christmas  If I am not very much mistaken there are many still living who remember this laudable Custom  The  Garden  belonging to this House tho' beneath some others in this Street for Art and Curiosity and Beauty of Flowers yet in this it glories above all the others that the  RomanWall  which was undoubtedly one of the great Works of the  Roman Empire  is said to have passed through the middle of it  Sect III  Of St  JOHN's CHURCH  THIS Church is situated almost close to the Vicarage It is dedicated to St  John the Baptist  but who was the Founder I never met with I am inclinable to believe it was founded by the  Townspeople  notwithstanding a Conjecture of an  Anonymous Gentleman  which is that  Robert Rhodes  was the Builder of this Church But this I think is impossible for the earliest he can be supposed to have lived is about the Year in the Reign of  Henry  the th when  John Rhodes  who was perhaps his Father was Mayor whereas it is certain this Church was built at least an Hundred Years before For the Grant of  Adam  of  Durham  to the the Priest of St  Thomas  the Martyr's  Chan∣tery  in this Church bears Date the th of  March  in the Reign of  Edward  the d consequently then the Church must have been in being at this Time and so could not have been built by  Robert Rhodes  Nay in a Charter dated belonging to the Rev Mr  Smith  of  Melsomby  to whom I have been obliged for a Sight of a great many Writings I meet with these Words  Venellum quo itur ad Ecclesiam Sancti Joannis  So that this Church was still earlier in Being  viz  in the th of  Edward  the st However it is supposed that the  Steeple  of this Church was either built or at least beautified by him as also the  SouthCross  of the Church for his  Coat of Arms  as also these Words  Orate pro Anima Roberti Rhodes  are upon both of them which indeed makes it somewhat probable  THIS Church as  Grey  informs us was commended by an  ArchPrelate  of this Kingdom because it resembleth much a  Churches were usually built in form of the Cross to represent and comme∣morate the Cross on which our Lord died  Cross  which indeed it does more than any other in this Town  THERE were three  Chanteries consisted of Salaries al∣lowed to one or more Priests to say daily Masses for the Souls of their deceased Founders and their Friends These were Adject∣ives not able to stand of themselves and therefore united for their better Support to some parochial Collegiate or Cathedral Church  Ful

Service every Day at the  Altar  of St  Thomas  the Martyr in  this Church  I take this Chantry to have been situated on the North Side of the said Church extending as far as and adjoining close to the  NorthCross  of the Church  WHEN this Priest of the Chantry dyed another was to be chosen after the Decease of the Benefactor  Adam  by the  Mayor  and  Bailiffs  of this Town for the Time being together with four of the most discreet and judicious Men of the Parish of St  John  elected for that Purpose The  Mayor c  had  also the Power of turning out the Priest of this Chantry  St  JOHN's  Church  and putting another in his stead if he neglected his Duty upon any Canonical Impediment be∣yond Days If he was taken with a Fit of Sickness he was obliged to provide another at his own Expence to wait upon the Altar They had a Power also of turning him out and putting another in his Stead if any Scan∣dalous Crime was proved upon him  THIS Writing was sealed by the Seal of the Benefactor and

out of Tenements in  Westgate Side  without  Westgate  and a Close without  Westgate  I have been told that the  Painted Glass  on one of the South Windows of the Quire of this Church had on it the Representation of the  Trinity  It does indeed still resemble some such Thing but if the Knowledge of it was need∣ful it might be Queried whether it ever was any such Representation  THERE is another Thing at the Top of this Quire which tho' little known is yet of greater Certainty and that is the  Funnel  or  Wood Box  in the Form of a  Spout  which hangs from the Top of this Quire This was a Conveyance for an Artificial  Dove  on the Day of  Pentecost  in the Times of Popery to represent the  Descent of the Holy Ghost  That there were such Things in Churches tho' in none that I know of in this Town but this is Matter of Fact For thus we are told that  BeeHive of the Romish Church  Geo Geld∣ing  p    on  Whitsunday  the Papists be∣gin to play a new interlude For then they sent down  a Dove  out of an  Owl  's  Nest  devised in the  Roof  of the Church But first they cast out  Rosin  and  Gunpowder  with  Wildfire  to make the Children afraid and that must needs be the Holy Ghost which cometh with Thunder and Lightning  THERE was formerly an  Organ  in this Church This appears from the last Will and Testament of Mr  John Wilkinson  Merchant of this Town who was one of the Ancestors of the present Mr  John Wilkinson  Merchant to whom I am obliged for a Sight of this Will It bears Date  Feb  and has these Words  I Iohn Wylkinson  c  commend my Soule unto Almyghtie God

said they were Papistry and Supestition they began with the Spoon of this Church's Font and broke it all to Pieces It had been given by one  John Bertram  For there was written about it  For the Honour of God and St  John John Bertram  gave this Font Stone Cuthbert Maxwell  a  Mason observing the Barbarity of the  Scots  came in Haste to St  Nicholas  and saved the Spoon of that Font in it's

New one as they were call'd upon the Founding of the latter The old one must have been founded not many Years after the  Nunnery  of St  Bartholomew  which was founded by King  Henry  the First For in a Char∣ter granted by King  Henry  the Second to the  Nuns  of St  Bartholomew  there is mention made of St  Mary  's in this Town as may be seen in our Account of  these Nuns  But this Conjecture will be more confirm'd if it be consider'd that a Charity was bestow'd on  this Hospital  by the Lord  Walter de Bolbeck  as is mention'd below who  Gib Camb p  as we are told in a Charter dated the first Year of King  Stephen  convey'd some Lands to the Church of  Winchester  If this was the same  Walter  with him below and there appears nothing to the con∣trary then it is a strong Reason that  this Hospital  was founded in King  Henry  the First's Reign The latter  Hospital  and  Chapel  were founded by one  Ego Ase∣lack de Kil∣lynghowe fundavi Ho∣spitale San∣cta' Mariae Virginis Capellam super Ter∣ram meam in  Novo Ca∣stello  super Tynam ibi posui duos fratres regulares unum Capellanum ad serviandum Deo pauperibus reddidi meipsum Deo Beatae Mariae Fratribus eju  dem Hospitalis ibidem Deo serventibus ad Hospitandum Pauperes egenos Clericos Peregrinos transeuntes pro Salute animae Patris mei Matris meae omnium per∣tinentium pro salute animarum Omnium Hospitalis Benefactorum  Lib Cart  Aselack  of  Killinghow  or  Killingworth  as he himself acknowledges in his Char∣ter for that Purpose I  Aselack  of  Killinghowe  have founded the  Hospital  and  Chapel  of St  Mary  the  Virgin  upon my own Land for  Two Brethren  to be  Regulars  and one  Chaplain  to serve God and take Care of the Poor  WE learn also from the same Charter that the Founder devoted himself to God and Religion as he himself says according to the Way of that Age I render my self to God and the Blessed Virgin  Mary  and the Brethren of the same Hospital there serving God to do Works of Hospitality to the Poor  the  Needy Clergy  and  Pilgrims  And this he says he does for his own Soul  St  MARY  's Hospital  for the Soul of his Father and Mother and his other Relations together with the Souls of all the  Benefactors  of the Hospital  SOME of the Witnesses to this Foundation Charter were  Gilbert  Parson of  Eland Richard  Parson of  Standfordham Waldon  Parson of  Newburne Eusta∣chius  Parson of  Benton  THE particular Time when it was founded can't be exactly learned there being no Date at the Charter But it is probable from a Charter of King  Richard  the First that it was founded some little while before he began to Reign for when he confirms the  Sciatis me dedisle concessisse Domino Sanctae Ma∣riae San∣ctimoniali∣bus de  Novo Castello  pro salute Ani∣mae meae antecesso∣rum meo∣rum  Aselack Burgeum me∣um de Novo Castello  c Lib Cart  Foundation of  Aselack  he speaks of him as then living otherwise he would not call him  his Burgess  of  Newcastle  as he does in the Charter  WE meet also with an Account of a Third Foundation belonging to this  Hospital  which Account is this The  Hospital  of our  Lady  called  Westgate Spittle  was founded by the Inhabitants of  Newcastle  for a  Master  and  Chaplain  to say Divine Service for  Bede Folks  in the  Almshouse  and to lodge  Poor  and  wayfaring People  and to  bury  such as hapned to die there and to distribute yearly  Nine Chaldron  of  Coals  among poor People The yearly Value of this was  l    s De Rebus Novocast'  AFTER the founding of this  Hospital  and  Chapel  there were several Dona∣tions and Charities bestowed upon it as had been before upon the old one some of the  Benefactors  of both which and Masters among a large Number which might be mentioned are these following  Benefactors  Mayors  Other Witnesses  Masters  Robert de Heddon  Clerk gave by the Will and Con∣sent of his Lord  Walter de Bolbec  a yearly Sum on Condition that the  Frater∣nity  would pray for the Souls of his Lord and his Ance∣stors and also for his own Soul and his Ancestors This was confirmed by the said Lord to this  Hospital  It is no small Confir∣mation of the Conjecture abovementioned the An∣tiquity of this Hospital from the Donation of  Wal∣ter de Bolbeck  that there is no mention made here of the Mayor of  Newcastle  which is a Proof that this Donation was before the Time of  Mayors  and con∣sequently that this  Hospital  was founded at the Time supposed  Reginold de Benwell John Morress  And several others     Julian  Daughter of  Ag∣nes Blanch  gave a Charity to this  Hospital  that her Soul and the Souls of her Ancestors might be pray'd for and that she might be entit'led to a Lodging in the said Hospital when she came to Town  Henry de Carliol  Mayor about the Year in the Reign of  Hen  d  Adam Clerious Thomas de Carliol John Flemmynge John Sante  Bailiffs of the Town  Robert Lacy  was now Rector of the Hospital  Martin Corman  gave a Messuage to it for the Sake of Charity as he himself says in his Grant and for the Sake of his Soul  To this Writing was an∣nexed the  Seal of the Town of  Newcastle Henry  of  Car∣liol  being Mayor that Year  which probably was the Year the th Year of his Mayoralty for he was Mayor years toge∣ther  Robert de Mitford  who was probably one of the  Northumberland  Family of that Name was Witness to this Deed as was also  Adam de

Adams  and  James Woodshaw  under the yearly Rent of  s    d  IN the th of King  James  the First a Charter was granted for the Hospi∣tal of St  Mary  the Virgin  THE  GrammarSchool  of this Town which is now at  Westspittle  was ori∣ginally founded by  Thomas Horsly  who was  Mayor  of  Newcastle  in the Year of our Lord By his last Will he devised all his Lands in  Newcastle  af∣ter the Death of him and his Wife to erect a  GrammarSchool  which was to be free for any one within and without the Town in the Manner directed by the said Will  BUT in the Year it was removed from St  Nicholas  's Churchyard from that House which is on the North Side of the Church over that Place where the  Privy  now is  M S  Mil∣bank  where it had been from the Time of it's Institution to the  Westspittle  The Reason of which was this Queen  Elizabeth  ordain∣ed and granted that within this Town of  Newcastle  and the Liberties there∣of there should be erected and for ever there be one  Free Grammar School  which should be a  Free GrammarSchool  of Queen  Elizabeth  in  Newcastle  and should consist of one  Master  and  Scholars  to be instructed in the same and that they the  Master  and  Scholars  of the same should for ever be  one Body Corporate in Law Fact  and  Name  by the  Master  and  Scholars  of the  Free Gram∣marSchool  of Queen  Elizabeth  in  Newcastle  upon  Tyne c  and by that Name should have perpetual Succession and should be in perpetual Times to come able and capable in the Law of having purchasing  c  Lands Tenements  c  to them and their Successors in Feesimple or for Term of Years so they exceed not the yearly Value of  l  and so they were not holden of the  said Queen  her Heirs and Successors in chief nor by  KnightService  And that the  Mayor  and  Burgesses  of  Newcastle  and their Successors or the greater Part of them  c  should have Power to make an honest learned and discreet Man to be the First and  Modern Usher  in the said School there to continue during the good Pleasure of the said  Mayor  and  Burgesses c  and that if the said  Ma∣ster  and  Usher  should die or leave the said School  c  then they might chuse other Men to be  Master  and  Usher c  IT is very probable that the Town of  Newcastle  who always presented a  Master  to this  Hospital  as it did to St  Mary Magdalen  's and St  Thomas  the  Martyr  upon  TyneBridge  did at this Time make the Master of the  GrammarSchool  Master also of the Hospital  Grey  tells us that the  first Master  of the  head School  was the Rev Master  Robert Fowberry  a learned and painfull Man to indoctrinate Youth in Greek and Latin To be sure he was the first Ma∣ster after the Removing of the  School  to the  Westspittle  For undoubtedly there were Masters before that as the School was so much earlier founded And accordingly in the Manuscript abovementioned 'tis said that when Mr  Burras  gave over the the  FreeSchool  in St  Nicholas  Churchyard the Mayor and more sent for Mr  Fowberry  to  Hull  and he came and first taught in the  WritingSchool  until the  Chapel  of St  Mary  's  Hospital  was made into a  Schoolhouse  and the  Electionhouse  was at the Eastend of it which had been the  Vestry  But Sir  George Selby  who was then  Mayor  set up his Arms on the  EastWindow  made a  Traverse  over it and sent to  London  for  Chairs  of  Mustinie Leather  and there is the Election tho' the Mayor lays down his Staff in the  old School  THE Masters of this  Hospital  and  School  since  Robert Fowberry  M A are  EDWARD Wigham  Clerk  FRANCIS

Son upon her Knees at the Eastend of it is now the Place of  Electing Mayors Aldermen Sheriffs  and the o∣ther Officers of the Town and is therefore now called the  ElectionHouse  but formerly the Mayor was chosen in the  WritingSchool  This is constant∣ly done the  Monday after Michaelmas Day  which is therefore in this Town called  Michaelmas Monday  Sect V EARL  of  WESTMORELAND  's House  NEXT to St  Mary  's on the same Side of this Street is a very old Buil∣ding which was lately the Dwellinghouse of Sir  Robert Shaftoe  K  t    Recorder of this Town  now the Property and Dwellinghouse of Mr  Charles Clark  Jun  r  It has the Magnificence and Grandure of Antiquity in it's Looks but what it has been formerly I could never find out  Grey  tells us That in this Street the Earl of  Westmoreland  had his House which indeed is true It was built by the Baron of  Bywell  and  Bolbeck  about the th of  Edward  the Third Much about the same Time he built a House within the Bounds of the  Castle  for the Defence of it as may be seen in our Account of the  Castle  This House in  Westgate  was called  BolbeckHall  but afterwards upon it's Founder's being created  Earl  which was in the Reign of  Richard  the Second in the Year when  Ralph Nevil  Lord of  Raby  was created  Earl Mar∣shall  it got the Name of  WestmorelandPlace  in  Wesgate  Some have conje∣ctured that Sir  Robert Shafto  's House abovementioned was part of it and  indeed it looks much liker a Part of such a Building  E Westmor∣land  's house  than any other Thing remaining thereabouts I am sure much more so than the House which is supposed to have been it which I am told was the House opposite to the West End of  DentonChair  which the Rev Mr  Cowling  lately lived in and which belongs to Mr  Ord  HOWEVER be this as it will whether it was this House now mention∣ed or whether  WestmorelandPlace  reached from this House to Sir  Robert Shafto  's including it which some have conjectured yet this is certain that it must have been hereabouts for  Nevil Tower  is directly behind this Piece of Ground we are speaking of which is a sure Token this must be the very Place because whoever in the Town built a Tower at their own Expence it was generally nigh them for their own Security Thus the  WhiteFryers  the Brethren of St  Mary  's Hospital the Brethren of St  Austin  c Built their Towers over against their  Monasteries  for their own Safeguard and Se∣curity But what I think puts it out of Dispute that Sir  Robert Shafto  's House was no Part of it is that in the Eleventh of Queen  Elizabeth  upon the Attainder of  Charles  Earl of  Westmoreland  this House where Mr  Cow∣ling  lived was in Charge which the other never was before the Auditors and in the Third of  Charles  the First was sold to the Citizens of  London  Lib de re∣bus Novo∣cast  IT was afterwards in the Tenure of  James Bertram  and after that in the Tenure of  Robert Bertram  OPPOSITE to this House is a Chair or Lane called  Denton  Chair which leads into the  GroatMarket Middlestreet  c  THIS Street is continued 'till you come to the Street leading Westward to the  Postern  and Eastward to the  Backraw  From thence the Street changes it's Name and is called  Tuthill  'till you come to the  Tuthill Stairs  which lead into the  Close  Sect VI BAILIFF GATE  ON the EastSide of this Street is a Street facing the Westside of the  Castle  called  Bailiff Gate  which is said to have got it's Name from the Coming of the  Fellons  of the County of  Northumberland  along that Street at∣tended by the County Bailiffs They came as is said to the  Westgate  then down an old Way close by the Outside of the  TownWall  and so in at the  WhiteFryer Gate  from whence they went along  Bailiff Gate  and so were conveyed in at the  PosternGate  on the WestSide of the  Castle  opposite to this Street of  Bailiff Gate  This is only Traditional and has been therefore deny'd by the Town of  Newcastle Grey  's Account is That at this Gate the Prisoners were brought in who were taken in Times of Hostility with  Scot∣land  and carry'd from thence privately into the Castle where the Goal for the County is now  THE same Author also tells us that this Street of  Bailiff Gate  formerly belonged to the  Castle  and County of  Northumberland  But I imagine had this been true the  King  would long ago have had his Right The Town of  Newcastle  indeed has sometimes been made uneasy about that  Bailiffgate  but still had it surer fixed to her as her undoubted property  IN the Year the Year after the King was beheaded there was a Sur∣vey taken of  Bailiff Gate  c  IN the Year following  April  th an Order was sent down for an∣nulling and vacating the Survey made  c  which was as follows  th  April  At the Committee of Parliament in removing Obstructions in the Sale of the Honours  c  of the late  King Queen  and  Prince  WHEREAS  the Mayor Burgesses and other the Inhabitants of the Town of  Newcastle  upon  Tyne did prefer their Petition unto this Committee complaining that certain Persons employed for the Common Wealth have returned a Survey to their Trustees for Sale of the late King's Lands of and concerning di∣vers Lands Tenements and Hereditaments within the said Town of  Newcastle  and Precincts thereof to the Value of  l s d per Annum  for which they have paid only a Fee Farm Rent to the Crown and in which the Petitioners declare they had an indoubted Inheritance Further complaining that the Premisses in Question were  not in the Possession of the Crown  Anno    neither was there returned any special Matter in the Survey whereby to entitle the late King to the same The Petitioners being the  undoubted Proprietors and Owners of the Things in Question  And whereas upon reading of the said Petition and the Certificate of the Trustees and Survey made in pursuance of an Order of this Com∣mittee grounded upon the said Petition and the hearing of this Cause this Day be∣fore the Committee concerning the Premisses in Question in the Presence of Council for the Common Wealth as also the Council in behalf of the said Town The Coun∣cil in behalf of the Common Wealth did acknowledge  that the said Survey was returned without any just Grounds  And forasmuch as  the Council for the said Town of  Newcastle  were ready to produce their Charters and Evidences  whereby to make it evidently appear that the Inheritance of the Premisses in Que∣stion  have been for Years and upwards in the Possession of the Petitioners and their Predecessors  It is therefore this Day order'd by the Committee that the Original Survey returned of divers Messuages Lands and Tenements and Here∣ditaments within the Town of  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  and Precincts thereof held by the said Town now remaining with the Trustees Surveyor and Register for Sale of the said Lands  be annull'd and void  and is hereby vacated and that no fur∣ther Sale or other Proceedings he had or made thereupon and that an Entrance of this Order be made upon the said Survey and a Memorandum be made thereupon That the said Survey is vacated to the Intent that the  Mayor Burgesses  and o∣ther Inhabitants of the said Town of  Newcastle  may not for the Future be questi∣oned or molested concerning the Premisses mentioned in the said Survey and the Transcript of this Order be likewise entred with the said Trustees and Contracters for Sales of the said Lands  JAMES CHALONER  NATH RICH  JOHN GARLAND  THO LISTER  JO JONES  AT the EastEnd of this Street upon the Right Hand is a Way to the  Long Stairs  which lead into the  Close  and on the left you go to the  Side  and St  Nicholas  Church  c  THE South Side of this Street is mostly the Property of Mr  Joshua Douglas  Whitefryers  Sect VII  LOWER down a little almost at the End of the Street on that same Side of the Street where are the Houses of  George Grey  Esq  Mr  An∣derson c  was the House of the  Carmelites  or  White Fryers  THE  Carmelites  are so named from Mount  Carmel  in  Syria  They were first brought into  England  by  Ralph Freeborne  and by him placed near  Alnwick  at a Place called  Holm  in a Wilderness which was in his Opinion likest to Mount  Carmel  in  Syria  the Place they came from The first Provincial of this Order was  Ralph Freeborne  himself who began his Rule in the Year and ruled Years He lies buried at  Alnwick  Fuller's  Hist  of Ab∣bies  Speed  THis Monastery was founded by King  Edward  the First and dedicated to St  Mary  I have met with little else relating to them except that they were a Prior seven Fryers and two Novices and that they surrendred  Jan  th th of  Henry  the Eighth It was valued at  l    s    d  THERE are not now the least remains of this  Priory  to be seen except a small Part of the ancient Building facing the  WhiteFryer Tower Walls  KING  Henry  the Third by his Letters Patents dated the th of  No∣vember  in the st

was supposed by Sir  John Fenwick  to be in the Close of the  WhiteFryers  late in the Holding of Sir  Ralph Delaval  then called by the Name of  Domus Fratrum de Penetentia I Christi  P de Reb Nov  FROM the  WhiteFryery  this Street leads to the  Tuthill Stairs  which is a Passage into the Street called the  Close  CHAP V  NEWGATESTREET Of the upper and higher Parts of this Street towards the  North  T  HE old Part of  Newgate  together with that Part of the  Wall  leading as far as  EverTower  being visibly older than the other Towers and the Rest of the Wall is a sure Sign that when the Walls were began this Part of the Town was then inhabited  IT is probable that hereabouts was the ancient  Monkche∣ster  where the  Monks  and religious Men inhabited This appears from a Place in this Street  viz That Row of Houses  which stands almost in the Middle of the Street called to this Day the  Huckster  's  Booths  For the People who dwelt in these Houses were  Hucksters  and supplied the Religious Houses with Provisions There is a Tradition still among the Inha∣bitants of this Part of the Town That in old Times there were many Mar∣kets between the  Newgate  and the  WhiteCross  nay some of them according to the Tradition they have received will Point out the  very Ground  where such and such  Markets  were  NOW this I think is a sufficient Proof that these Upper Parts of the Town were first inhabited by the  Monks  the Lower Parts as far as the  Ca∣stle Yard  were the Habitations of the  Town's People  The  Castellum  or For∣tification having been thereabouts from the Beginning of  Hadrian  's Wall as we are inform'd by a  Mr  Horse∣ly  of  Mor∣peth  who dy'd a few Months ago a little before the publishing of his  Roma∣na Britannia  the Book re∣ferr'd to  This Gentle∣man was of he was of the Publick  GrammarSchool  of this town and afterwards studied in one of the Scotch Colleges He was Ma∣ster of Arts there and Fellow of the  Royal Society  He is supposed to have been equally Knowing with any in his Time in the  British Roman Antiquities Rom Britt  late ingenious Author  He says there must have been a  Station in this Town  for these Reasons If we consider the Importance of this Place it's Distance from the first Station at the End of the Wall and the Turns the Wall makes especially at the East Side of the Town in Or∣der to it's passing through the Heart of it we can scarce Question but there has been a Station here And it's old Name of  MonkChester  seems to put it out of Doubt The former Part of the Name is taken from the Settlement of the  Monks  in this Place and the latter Part from the Word  Castra  which is a pretty sure Mark of a Station Besides the Name  Newcastle  given first  to the Castle it self and then to the Town has been thought to imply as in other Instances that there was an old  Vid Chap  of the  Castle  Castle or Fort there before and near the Place where the  new One  was erected And as this  Newcastle  was built by  Robert  Son of  William  the Conqueror the  old Castle  must have been undoubtedly  Roman  And some Years ago a Coin of  Vespasian  was found near the Castle as I was told by the Person himfelf that found it  THE same learned Author goes on thus The next Thing is to determine the Boundaries and Situation of this Station which I persuade my self may be done I hinted before that there was a Traditionary Account of the Walls passing through St  George  's Porch near the North West Corner of St  Ni∣cholas  Church But it is certain that the Line of the Wall lies a little to the North of this End of the Church and I think has not touched this Porch tho' it comes near it And therefore I conjecture that the Wall which has passed through this Porch must have been the East Rampart of the Station for the Supposition will reconcile these seemingly differing Accounts And if a Line be erected Perpendicular to that of  Severius  's Wall so as to pass thro' that Porch and be continued along the Brow of the Hill at the Head of the Side 'till it meet the Line of  Hadrian  's  Vallum  near the East End of  Balygate  and not far from the Castle This Line seems to answer so well in Respects that I cannot much Doubt it's having been the Eastern Limits of the ancient Station For this brings the Station near to the Castle which probably has been built a little more to the South East in order to bring it nearer to the Top of a Steep Hill And fixing the Eastern Boundary of the Station here leaves a Plain and Level Area for the Station it self and with∣out it a Descent towards the South and the River for the Town to stand upon which might extend it self to the Bridge supposing the ancient Bridge to be near the same Place where the present one stands From which Bridge the ancient Town and Station might probably take the Name of  PonsAelii  This Eastern Boundary of the Station must at that Time have been near∣er the River than it is now now since 'tis certain that the River formerly flowed farther up towards this Part of the Town The Position of the Ea∣stern Rampart of the Station being thus determined the other Boundaries may be also defined for the Distance here between the Lines of the Walls seems to be about six Chains and it is not much to be questioned but the two Walls here as in other Cases they frequently did have fallen in with the Northern and Southern Ramparts of the Station so that these six Chains have been the Breadth of the Station And if we suppose the Station to have been of a middle Size we must make it a Square and allow six Chains for the length of it If at this Distance another Line be drawn equal and Parallel to the former and between the Lines of the Wall it will be the Western Boun∣dary of the Station as the two respective Parts of the two Walls make the Northern and Southern Limits And upon this Supposition a Line drawn from the Foot of the  Fleshmarket  to  Bailygate  near the east End of it will be the Eastern Limits of the ancient Station That Part of the  Vallum  which reaches from  Bailygate  to Mr  Ord  's House will be the Southern Limit and a Line drawn from hence to that Part of the Line of  Severus  's Wall which is about thirty Yards East from the End of  Rosemarylane  must be the We∣stern Boundary and the Part of  Severus  's Wall included between this and the Foot of the  Fleshmarket  remains for the Line of the Northern Rampart  Sect I  Of  St ANDREW'S CHURCH  NIGH to  Newgate  on the Westside of the Street is St  Andrews Church  This is questionless the oldest Church of this Town not only from it's  Situation which is that Part where was principally the ancient  Monkchester  St  Andrew  's Church  but also from the Model and Fashion of it's building it appearing in these Things older than the others  De Reb Novocast'  IT is supposed to have been built by one of the Kings of  Scotland David  King of  Scots  is mention'd in particular as it's Founder but for what Rea∣son I know not Indeed that  David  who dy'd in the Year was a great Benefactor to  Churches  and  Religious Houses  and he is said in particular to have founded in this Town  Collier Ec∣cles  two  Religious Houses  but there is not a Word of his being the Founder of St  Andrew  's which in all Probability would as soon have been taken Notice of and handed down to Posterity had it been true as the Building of two  Religious Houses  But besides if St  Andrew  's be the oldest Church in this Town and this I think ought to be allowed for the Reasons already given as also from the constant Tradition of it's being so then it is undoubtedly older than St  Nicholas  's and if so it must have been built before the Time of  Henry  the First for St  Nicholas  's was built in that Reign at latest and therefore it will follow that this Church of St  Andrew  's was built before  David  King of  Scots  was born  I am therefore rather inclinable to believe that it was founded by the  Town's People  and the  Religious Houses  which at that Time of Day were chiefly in those higher Parts of the Town  THERE were three  Chanteries  belonging to this Church one of which was dedicated to our  Lady  which was of the Yearly Value of  l    s    d  No Deed of Foundation is shewed but however it must at least have been founded in the Reign of  Edward  the First for in the latter End of that Reign in a Charter which one  Roger Amyas  granted to one  Stephen  it is order∣ed that he shall have such a particular  Booth  for the Term of Years Pro∣vided he pay so much to the  Tyne Bridge  and to the  Altar  of St  Mary  in the  Church  of St  Andrew  's in  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  IT had a House of  Seven Shillings  per Annum belonging to it it abutted on the North next to the  Newgate  and on the East on the  Highstreet  on the West on St  Andrew  's Churchyard and on the South on a Tenement which in the Nineteenth Year of the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  belonged to  Robert Hallyman  THERE belonged also to this  Chantery  a House and a Rig lying in the Croft value  s    d  ANOTHER was the Chantery of the  Trinity  which was of the yearly Va∣lue of  l    s    d  There is no Deed of Foundation to be seen of it But however to give some Account of it's Founder it may not be amiss to Copy what I writ a few Years ago on Parchment and presented to the Church of St  Andrew  's  To the Rev Mr  John Ellison  Minister  And  To the ChurchWardens of St  ANDREW's  in  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  Mr  Christopher Rutter  Mr  Fenwick Lambert  Mr  Thomas Shevil  Mr  Percival Bell  GENTLEMEN  I Had the Curiosity lately to search among the Old Writings in your Vestry for that famous  Indulgence  which is said to have been  Vid Grey p  granted to your Church by the Pope for  Nine thousand Years to come  but found no such Thing  THERE is however another Indulgence which discovers a Piece of Anti∣quity relating to your Church which I chused to acquaint you with in this Manner that the ancient Name of a Part of your Church now worn out of the Memories of our  Townsmen  and almost intirely lost might again be brought to light  THIS Indulgence was granted in the Reign of King  Richard  the Second in the Year an Age in which Indulgencies were common and when they were of Particular Service towards the Building or repairing of Chur∣ches For at that Time of Day when the Building or repairing or adorn∣ing of a Church was requisite an Indulgence was granted for such a Term of Years or Days to all such as would be assisting in the Things aforesaid by which Means many Churches have been built repair'd and beautified and accordingly this Indulgence of yours was granted partly for the same End that the Church of St  Andrew  's might be kept in sufficient Repair For it promi∣ses an Indulgence or Pardon for  Qui ad re∣parationem seu orna∣mentum sive emendatio∣nem Eccle∣siae Sancti Andreae vil∣lae Novoca∣stri super Tynam lin    Indul Quadraginta dies Indul∣gentiae con∣cedimus  Days to every one who shall con∣tribute towards the repairing or beautifying of the Church of St  Andrews  in  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  and then follows the Antiquity design'd  THAT whoever  Ac Capellae Sanctae Tri∣nitatis in parte Aqui∣lonari ejus∣dem Eccle∣siae aurum argentum c Lin    Indulg'  offers or sends or Causes to be sent to the  Chapel of the Holy Trinity in the Northern Part of the same Church  either Gold Silver Vest∣ments Books Chalices or any other Ornaments which are wanting to the aforesaid  Chapel  or  Altar  or Image of the  Holy Trinity  which is in the same Chapel Or who shall fall down upon their Knees before the  Image  of the  Holy Trinity  aforesaid and pray for the Health of Sir  Adam de Athol  Kn  t  as long as he lives and for his Soul after his Decease and for the Soul of the Lady  Mary  his Wife whose Body lies buried in the same  Chapel  of the  Holy Trinity  shall as often as they perform those Things or any of the Things beforemention'd have the Benefit of a  Forty Days Indulgence  NOW from this it is observable that that waste Place in the  Northern Isle  which opens into the Quire must be the  Chapel  here spoken of For there lies the Body of Sir  Adam  's  Wife  which is said in the Indulgence to be buried in the  Et pro Anima Do∣minae Mariae sponsae suae cu∣jus Corpus in eadem Capel∣la sanctae Tri∣nitatis Qutes∣cit  Lin Indulg  Chapel of the Holy Trinity  as also the Body of Sir  Adam  himself The Building itself is after the Manner of Chapels which were added to parish Chur∣ches and it is still observable that at the Top of the North Window in the Chapel there seems to be a Picture of the Holy Trinity represented according to the Superstition of these Times by the face of  an old Man our Saviour upon the Cross  and the Figure of a  Dove  it having been always Customary in these Times not only to have the  Image of the Saint  set up to whom the Church was dedicated but also to adorn the Windows with it  I am of Opinion that Sir  Adam de Athol  himself was the Founder of this Chapel and my Reasons for it are these  st It was customary formerly for People of better Figure to build a small Chapel at a convenient Part of their parish Church that they might have a convenient Place to Worship God in or that it might be a burial Place for them and their Families Now it is evident that this Chapel of the  Holy Trinity  is such a one For if you suppose the Chapel away the Church it∣self will appear exactly uniform which shews the  Chapel  has been added to the Church and as Sir  Adam  and his  Lady  are buried in it is pretty clear that They were the Founders It may also be presumed that  He  built it be∣cause it seems to have been built when Sir  Adam  liv'd For it is said in the Indulgence to want Books Chalices Vestments  c  which implies it at that Time to have been  a new Chapel  And besides Indulgences were gran∣ted towards the adorning of Churches or Chapels immediately after they were built This Chapel was therefore built a little before the granting of this In∣dulgence which was when Sir  Adam  was living And as his Wife was then  dead and buried in this Chapel so she seems to have been the first that was buried in it and consequently her Husband must have built it  BUT my last Reason I think makes it amount to a Demonstration It may be observed in all Indulgences of this Kind that it was not only requir'd of the People to offer Church Ornaments but also to put up Prayers for the Founder Thus for Instance in an Indulgence granted in the Reign of King  Henry the Eighth  for the Repairing and Maintaining of the Church and Convent at  Kirby Belers  in the County of  Leicester  it was not only required that Money should be given but that they should also say a  Stavely  Ch Hist  pa  Pater Noster  with an  Ave  for the Souls of Sir  Roger Beler  and  Alyce  his Wife Founder and Foundress  NOW from hence it is plain that Sir  Adam  and his  Lady  must have been the Founder and Foundress of this Chapel because they alone are men∣tioned in this Indulgence and Prayers were to be put up for them as they were for Sir  Roger  and his Lady just now mentioned  THUS I think I have found out the ancient Name of your Chapel and who was the Founder it It may perhaps be somewhat Satisfactory to those who are curious in those Things may retrieve the antient Name of your Cha∣pel and establish the deserved Remembrance of it's Founder But be this as it will as I have only these Things in View in making these Observations so I hope you'll be so good as to accept of them and allow them a Place a∣mong the Parchments of your Church  I am Gentlemen Your most humble Servant  Henry Bourne  Silverstreet  Oct  THE Indulgence on which these Observations are founded are granted by  Oswald  the Bishop of  Candida casa  which is in  Gallaway  in  Scotland  it is dated at  York  the th Year of his Consecration  THE d  Chantery  belonging to this Church was dedicated to St  Thomas  This I learn from an Account I have met with of a House in this Street which is said to have belonged to the  Chantery  of St  Thomas  in the Church of St  Andrew  's  IT bounder'd on the West by St  Andrew  's Church end and on the North by a  House  which in the Reign of Q  Elizabeth  was in the Possession of  Richard Atkinson  and on the East by the  Highstreet  and on the South against the  ChurchStyle  It was valued at ten Shillings per Annum  THAT there was such a Chantery in St  Andrew  's notwithstanding the two former are supposed to be all belonging to this Church is further evident because I meet also with an Account which says that the Chantery of St  Thomas  in St  Andrew  's had an Orchard belonging to it which paid a yearly Rent of Three Shillings and Four Pence to it but where it stood is not men∣tioned It was occupied by Sir  Robert Brandlin  THAT there were Lands belonging to the Chantery of St  Mary  in this Church which were situated in this Street is certain But where to fix them at this Time of Day is pretty Difficult But wherever they were situa∣ted  there was an House situated near them which paid to the  Priory  of  Hex∣ham  Six Shillings per Annum  THIS is mention'd when  Rowland  was Prior in the Year in the Reign of  Henry  the th  De Reb Novocast'  I meet with no account of the Lands belonging to the Chantery of the  Tri∣nity  except that of an House situated in a Place called  le Cowgarth  in this  Newgatestreet  which paid one Shilling per Annum to this Chantery and a Tenement in  Westgate  which paid  s    d  THE Altar of this Church is very pretty and decent it was beautified a few Years ago at the Charge of the Parish  THERE is at the  Westend  of this Church a  Beautiful  Gallery which was built in the Year at the Charge

Belaysys  to  UniversityCollege  in  Oxford  The Site of it is thus describ'd  Situatum est infra praedictam villam juxta Novam Portam ejusdem villae in quo quidem Tenement'  Thomas Gray Lidster  modo inha∣bitat viz Inter Tenementum  Roberti Daunt  ex parte Boreali vicum Ducen∣tem ad fratres minores ab Ecclesia Sancti  Andreae  ex parte australi  But the same Writing goes further  ac Tria Tenementa duo Tofta inde in simul situantur in eodem vico ducente a dicta Ecclesia Sancti  Andreae  usque Fratres praedictos c  OPPOSITE to St  Andrew  's Church is a Lane which leads to  Pilgrim∣street  Gate called the  Highfryerchare  because of a Fryer which was in it and because it is higher up in the Town than the other Fryer Chare  IN coming down this Street Southward from the Church of St  Andrew  's on the Righthand is an ancient Street called  Darncrook  in which Street were some Wastes and House belonging to the Nuns of St  Bartholomew  as there were in almost every Street in the Town Opposite to this Place on the Eastside of this Street of  Newgate  is a little running Water which goes into  Lorkburne  This little  Bourn  is taken Notice of in the Account of the Ward belonging to  FicketTower  and is called there  a Bourn beside Lamplace that runneth towards Lorkburne  To this Bourn it is that the Prisoners belonging to  Newgate  have Liberty to walk during the Time they are not confin'd to the Goal  FROM thence going still Southward the Street changes it's Name from  Newgate  to  Huxter  's  Booths  for thereabouts it was that the  Huxters  lived as has been observed above who supply'd the  Religioushouses  and the other Peo∣ple of this Part of the Town with Provisions A Part of these Houses are still to be seen they stand by themselves almost in the  middle of the Street  nigh the  Whitecross Grey  says That this Part of the Town was in his Time called the  HuxtersBooths  that is as I understand him from the  Bourn  above∣mentioned to those Houses  OPPOSITE to the  Booths  was a great Gate that led into the  Blackfryers  It was situated between the House of  William Wilkinson  Smith and the House of  Elizabeth Bell  Widow The Place now is the Entrance of a Garden be∣longing to Mr  Nicholas Baily  of  Newcastle  This I think is evident from a Grant of a Tenement from the  Blackfryers  now in the Hands of Mr  Tho Mar∣shall  of this Town wherein in describing the Situation of the Tenement are these Words  Sicut jacet in villa antedicta prope crucem vulgariter vocatam  Whytt∣cross  inter magnam portam praedictorum Fratrum e Regione praedictae crucis ex parte Boreali  c The Tenement described is the House lately rebuilt by Mr  Mar∣shall  aforesaid Since this Conjecture from the Writing abovementioned I have met with the Manuscript of Mr  Milbank  which very much corroborates it The Words are these the Gateway to this House was from the White∣cross and was called when our Author liv'd  Wind  's  hole  The way was a narrow Lane to the Fryery which in his Time was joining to Mr  Brandling  's Ground whereupon there was and still is a Mill  THE Business and Trade of this upper Part of the Street is chiefly that of the  Tanners  WHITECROSS  FROM the  Huxters Booths  to almost the  Nungate  the Street changes it's Name again for the Name of the  WhiteCross  because of a  Cross  which stood there to which from the  Huxster  's  Booths  was the ancient Market of this Town as there is at this Day at the  CaleCross  This  Cross  was pulled down that very Night after Sir  George Selby  dyed and King  James  of Sacred Memory  March    Milbank  M S  ON the Place where the Cross stood was a Cistern for receiving of that Water which goes by the Name of the  NewWater  This was lately pulled down and there is now in the Place where the Cross was a Pillar of Stone∣work The Street hereabouts is wide and spacious and having in it several good Buildings such are the Houses of  William Carr  Esq  Thomas Clennell  Esq  c  There are four Fairs kept in this Street in the Year one at  Lammas  for Horses and another at St  Lukesmass  for Horses The other two are for  BlackCattle  the one on  AllSouls Day  and the other at  Martinmas  NEAR the Cross is a Lane called the  Lowfryerchare  it got the Name of  Fryerchare  from it's being situated near the  Blackfryers  and of the  Lowfryerchare  because it is not so high up the Town as the other  Fryerchare  IT was also called formerly  Shodfryerchare  because the  Blackfryers  were also called  Shodfryers  Sect III NUNNGATE  FROM the  Whitecross  Southward the Street leads to the  Nungate  which gives Name to a small Part of the Street thereabouts  THIS Gate was not the  Greatgate  of the  Nunnery  but a back Passage to it for  Nunnery  was situated lower down as may still be seen by the Ruins of some old Walls in their Garden Probably it was situated about the Place where Mr  Hebdon  a few Years ago built a large House which is built upon the same Ground where the  old stone House  stood inhabited by Mr  Green  which seem'd to have been built out of the Ruins of this  Nunnery  Here it was that King  Speed  Hist  Henry  the First founded the Hospital of St  Bartholomew  the  Apostle  for the  Nuns  of  Newcastle  In  H Rex c Sciatis me concessisse Charta confirmasse monialibus Sancti Bartholomei de Novo Castello super Tynam omnes Donationes quae

Richard Gosfard  a Charter granted them some Time  after they were founded  Nuns of St  Bartholo  w    which I take to be a Charter of King  Henry  the Second's they had all the Things bestowed upon them confirmed The  Acres  mentioned in the Charter I have not been able to find out A Manu∣script of Mr  Joshua Douglas  's says that probably all that Side of the Street from the  Nuns  to  Newgate  belonged to these  Nuns  for their Garden reaches to  Highfryerchare  This indeed is highly propable for the nine Tofts or Crofts confirmed to them in this Charter seem to be a good Proof of the Truth of it  IN the Garden which belong'd to them call'd still the  Nun  's  Garden  is a  low Square Vale  at the South West Corner of which Tradition says there is a  Vault  which leads to the  Blackfryers  Mr  Richmond  the present Stew∣ard of Mr  Blackett  told me he had seen the Entrance into it but that now it was fill'd up with Earth  De rebus Novocast'  STELLA  an ancient Village situated on the South of the River  Tyne  belonged to the  Nuns  of this Hospital  ON  September  the th d of  Charles  the Second after the Death of Sir  Nicholas Tempest  of  Stella  of the County of  Durham  Knight and Baronet it was found that he dyed possessed of the Manour of  Stella  in the Parish of  Ryton  in the County of  Durham  which had been Part of the Lands of the  House  or  Monastery  of St  Bartholomew  in  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  The following Writing for which I am obliged to the worthy Dr  Hunter  of  Durham  and from which I had this Confirmation is as follows      Die  Septemb  Anno      Caroli  Regis Compertum post Mortem  Nicholai Tempest  de  Stelley  in Com'  Dunelm'  Milit' Baronet' Quod fuit Seissatus de in Manerio de  Stellingley  al's Vocat'  Stelley

in  Pilgrimstreet  in the  Fleshmarket Oatmarket Darncrook  and almost all the Town over which belonged to the  Nuns  The Piece of Ground above the  Townmoor  called from them the  Nunmoor  belonged to them Mr  Riddle  's House and Chapel in  Gateside  commonly called  Gatesidehouse  was according to some a Sort of Infirmary for the  Nuns  of this Hospital  DR  Smith  in his Ecclesiastical History of  Bede  Ubi nulla remanent antiqui mo∣nasterii Ut∣tani vestigia Resentio∣ris quidem Pulcherri∣niam vide∣mus Capel∣lum vix ad∣huc Ruinis Succumben∣tem Tra∣ditio est cel∣lam fuisse sanctimoni∣alium No∣vocast rentium licet ejus Historiam apud Autores vix inveneris Smith in Not' Bed lib C  says that in  Gateside  there are no Footsteps remaining of the ancient  Monastery  of  Uttanus  but of a more Modern one we see a most beautiful Chapel which is not as yet in Ruins There is a Tradition that this was a Cell of the  Nuns  of  Newcastle  tho' we cannot readily Quote any Authority for it  THE Tradition mention'd by these Gentlemen appears somewhat probable for in the Charter beforemetioned the  Nuns  of St  Bartholomew  received two Shillings annually from this Cell  IT is also not improbable but St  Mary  's Hospital in  Westgate  was also a Cell to this Nunnery It appearing plainly from the Charter above that St  Mary  's was dependant on it  AND it's said in  Leland  that the Hospital of St  Mary  in  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  was given to the Use of  these Nuns  Lel Vol p  IT appears also from the Charter just abovementioned that among the other Things confirmed to this  Hospital  the Church of St  Bartholomew  was one I may be ask'd therefore where this Church was Situated In answer to this I dare venture to say that there never was any such Church in this Town I mean a Parish Church And therefore it must have been the Church or  Chapel  belonging to this Hospital and consequently must have been seated where the Hospital was And this appears to be the rather true because we have no other mention made of their  Chapel  and because when it is mention'd in the Charter it is said to be given them that they may serve God in it  IN the Year  Thomas Hatfield  Bishop of  Durham  confirmed to the Nuns of this House the Abbess they had elected her Name was  Alice Davill  She had been not duly elected and therefore he made the Election void but however as she was a Person the  Convent  very much approv'd of the Bishop of his special Favour order'd her to preside over them  THIS was granted at  Aukland May  the th in the Tenth Year of his Consecration  DR  Hunter  of  Durham  obliged me with the following Copy of the Bishop's Grant  THOMAS  permissione divina  Dunelm'  Episcopus Religiosae mulieri Dominae  Aliciae Davill  salutem

Houses therein it being a Recep∣ticle for Scots and Unfreemen and he bought it on Purpose to dislodge them He also bought the Garden and after having raised the Dean that went thro' it he made it a very pleasant Place it was from Corner to Corner Eleven Score Yards  Milbank M S  IT is now the Property of  Walter Blackett  Esq  and is a very delightful Meadow  Sect IV SCOTCH INN  OPPOSITE to this  Nunnery  on the Westside of the Street is an  an∣cient Building  with a large  Gate  which has formerly been a Piece of stately Workmanship  De rebus Novocast'  This Sir  Robert Shaftoe  Recorder of this Town was of Opinion was the House of the Earls of  Northumberland  and was cal∣led the  Earls Inn Grey  says it was called the  Scotch Inn  because it was there that the  Kings Nobility  and  Lards  of  Scotland  lodged in Time of Truce or League with  England  THIS Street from the  Scotch Inn  or thereabouts takes the Name of the  Bigg  and  Oatmarket  because in the Middle of it is kept a  Market  of  Bigg  and  Oats  every Tuesday and Saturday Here the Street is broader than almost a∣ny Street in the whole Town and adorn'd with good Houses At the End of it Southward is a very great  Market  for  Poultry  which gives the Name of the  Pullenmarket  to this Part of the Street  CHAP VI  Of the Division of this Street  H  AVING now got as far as the End of the broad Part of this Street we have the Breadth of it divided into  Three Streets  The first  Street  or that on the Right Hand is called the  Mealmarket  the  Oatmealmarket  or  Groatmar∣ket  because of the  Oatmeal  which is sold there every Day of the Week but more especially on the  Saturday  's What Name it had formerly or whether it ever had any other I cannot say but this is certain that it has re∣tained it's present Name above  two hundred Years  AT the Upperend of this Street or the Northend of it is the  Posthouse  of this Town which is adorned with a pretty  Area  of a  Quadrangular Figure  together with a good Garden It belongs to Mr  James Bell  the present PostMaster  AS you descend from this End of the Street you turn the Corner of this House upon the Right Hand into a Lane called the  Puddingchare  or as I have seen it in some ancient Writings  Buddingchare  which leads into  West∣gate  There were three Houses in this Lane which paid an Annual Rent to the Chantry of the  Holy Trinity  in St  John  's Church one paid  d per Ann  another  d  and the third  d  The Lane called  Rosemarylane  which turns upon the Right Hand as you go down this Chare into  Westgate  was former∣ly called St  John  's  Chare  because it led from the  Puddingchare  to St  John  's Church  IN this Lane there is a  Waste  which belong'd to the Nuns of St  Bartholo∣mew  boundering on the West on the Common Gutter and on the North on the Chantery Lands  THIS Waste is the Ground where are now the Gardens of Mr  James Bell  Postmaster and the old Houses on the North of these Gardens now the Property of Mr  Ralph Trotter  are the  Chantery Lands  here mentioned  OVER against the Southend of this Lane which so leads to St  John  's Church is an ancient Almshouse in which live seven poor People who have a small Allowance at Christmas from the Town  HAVING past the Eastend of the  Puddingchare  we go Southward which leads into the Body of the  Mealmarket  aforesaid  THERE is little in this Street worth taking Notice of the Houses ge∣nerally are very ancient and mean the few good ones are one which was built the last Year by Mr  Prior  of this Town Cooper an ancient Inhabitant in this Street and another the House below it which belongs to Mr  William Harrison  Dyer which was formerly the Dwellinghouse of  Timothy Robson  Esq  Alderman of this Town and sometime Mayor and some few others  IN the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  a House in this Street belonging to one  William Penrith  whose Site is now lost paid an annual Rent to the Chante∣ry of our Lady in the Parish Church of  Longbenton  Rom Bri∣tann p  THE late Mr  Horsely  tells us of another House in this Street in the laying of the Foundation of which about or Years since the Masons struck upon the Roman Wall at each of the Side Walls so that the Building stands cross the Roman Wall But where the Site of it is he does not say  TOWARDS the lower end of this Street is a large open where is a  Mar∣ket  every Saturday for  Wool  below this again a Lane leading into  Westgate  called  Dentonchare  PASSING by the Eastend of this Chare we come to the ancient  IronMar∣ket  which was opposite to St  Nicholas Church  in that Piece of Ground lead∣ing to the Side from the House of Mr  Charles Clark  and from below the Shop of the late Mr  John Kellot  Smith  ANOTHER Street which the broad Street of the  Bigmarket  is divided in∣to is the  Middlestreet  so called because it stands in the Middle of the Streets in this Part of the Town for it has on the Eastside of it the  Fleshmarket  and  Pilgrimstreet  and on the West the  OatmealMarket  and  Westgate  THIS Street bore anciently three Names the upper Part of it was called  Skinnergate  the lower Part of it  Spurriergate  and  Sadlergate  IT is a Street as it was in  Grey  's Time where all Sorts of Artificers have Shops and Houses  WE come now to the d Street  viz  the  Fleshmarket  at the upperend of which is the  Upperdeanbridge  so called because of the two Bridges which cross this Dean or Rivulet which runs into  Lorkburne  this is that which is the higher or upper one  HAVING passed by the Westend of this Bridge we go Southward into the  Fleshmarket  GREY  tells us  that when the Goodmen of this Town began to trade and venture beyond the Seas they built many Ships and procured a Char∣ter from the Kings of  England  to carry Fells beyond Seas and to bring in foreign Commodities The Staple was then at  Antwerp  in  Brabant  called  Commune totius Europae Emporium  The  Charter  of the  Merchant Adventurers  was the first Charter that was granted by any King to any Town  AFTER this Grant this Town flourished in trading built many fair Houses in the  Fleshmarket  then called  Clothmarket  The Merchants had  their Shops and Warehouses there in the Backparts of their Houses The River of  Tyne  flowed and ebbed where Boats came up with Commodities which Trade of Merchandizes continued many Years  IN this Street the Mayors Aldermen and richest Men of the Town lived  PART of the present  Fleshmarket  was called the  Clothmarket  and part of it the  Fleshmarket  and  Fishmarket  An Anonymous Authority says that in  Pil∣grimstreet  was the Market for  Fish  that came up to the  Netherdeanbridge  But this in my Opinion is a Mistake For in the Ward belonging to  Mor∣denTower  part of it is over the  Fleshshambles  from the North West Church Stile of St  Nicholas  unto the  Fishshambles  Consequently the  Fish  that came up to the  Netherdeanbridge  must have been sold in the  Fleshmarket  not in  Pilgrimstreet  The Shops of this Street are at present the Shops of Artificers and the Houses either chiefly Coffeehouses or Taverns or Alehouses  IN some ancient Writings belonging to that worthy Gentleman  The Rev Mr  Smith  of  Melsonby I find that several Houses in this Street paid an an∣nual Rent to  University College  in  Oxford  one of them in particular nigh the Church Yard paid  s  in the Year and so did many Houses in the o∣ther Streets of this Town to the same  College  Several of these were the Gift of the Lady  Ann Bellasys  to this College  An    THE  Fleshmarket  in this Street which is held every Saturday is a very great Market not only as it supplies the Town in a great Measure but as it also furnishes the Country for several Miles round Besides there are several Thousands of People belonging to the  CoalWorks  such as  StaithMen Wag∣goners PitMen Wrights KeelMen  c all which for the most part have their Provisions from this Market  THE Provision also for  Ships  is got from this Market And this indeed must be very considerable when there will be sometimes or hundred Sail in at a Time  THERE are  Fairs  kept in this Market every Year for Days together the one begins upon  Lammas  Day or the First of  August  which  Grey  calls  a remarkable Time of the Year  but why he calls it so he gives no Account This Fair is in some Measure of an ancient standing For we meet with some Account of it in the Reign of King  John  mentioned in a Charter of another of our Kings The Words are these  Insuper cum Dicti Burgenses per Chartam praefati Joannis Regis habeant in dicto Burgo unam feriam singulis annis per duos dies duraturam  viz  in vigilia in die Sancti Petri ad Vincula c  NOW from this it appears that King  John  granted to the Town of  New∣castle Lammas  Fair which he order'd should be held on the Eve of St  Peter ad Vincula  and upon the Day it self  Blount in Verb  I suppose  Grey  calls it a remark∣able Time of the Year as well because it is called  Lammas  Day as because it is called St  Peter advincula  As it is  Lammas  Day it is a remarkable Time of the Year for it is called  Lambmas  because  Lambs  were not then fit to eat they were grown too big  aliter  from the  Sax  III  asmaesse  q d Loaf∣mas  because on that Day the English made an Offering of Bread made with  new Wheat  On this Day it was that Tenants that held Lands of the Cathe∣dral Church of  York  which is dedicated to St  Peter ad Vincula  were bound by their Tenure to bring a  Live Lamb  into the Church at  Highmass  on that Day  IT is also a remarkable Time as it is St  Peter ad vincula  and as it is called the  Gule  of  August  from the Latin  Gula  a Throat The Reason is set down in  Durand  's  Rationale    Lib    c  who says that one  Quirinus  a  Tribune  hav∣ing a Daughter that had a Disease in her Throat went to  Alexander  then Pope  of  Rome  the th from St  Peter  and desired of him to borrow or to see the  Chains  that St  Peter  was chained with under  Nero  which being obtained the said Daughter kissing the Chains was cured of her Desease and  Quirinus  with his Family baptized  Tunc dictus  Alexander  Papa hoc Festum in Calendis augusti celebrandum instituit in honorem beati  Petri  Ecclesiam in Urbe Fabrica∣vit ubi vincula ipsa reposuit ad Vincula nominavit in calendis augusti dedi∣cavit In qua Festivitate Populus illic ipsa vincula hodie Osculatur  So that this Day being before called only the Calends of  August  was upon this Occasion termed indifferently either St  Peter  's Day  ad Vincula  from the Instrument that wrought the Miracle or the Gule of  August  from that Part of the Virgin whereon the Miracle was wrought  Blount in verb  AFTER this Fair granted by King  John  it was by a succeeding King or∣dered to begin at the same Time and to continue Days When it was reduced to the Time abovementioned I have not met with  THE other Fair held in this Market is at St  Lukesmas  it was granted to the Town in the Reign of  Henry  the th During the Time of these Fairs there is a Court of  Pyepowder  All the Privileges and Power that a Court Leet can have is granted to this Court  Grey    TOWARDS the Southend of this was a large  Cross  with a lead Cistern at the Top of it to hold the Water called the  Newwater  which was pulled down about Years ago Beyond this at the End of this Street is the  Cor∣diners Meetinghouse  CHAP VII  Of St  NICHOLAS  Church  A  T the End of the  Fleshmarket  on the Southside of the  Cordiners  Meetinghouse just now mentioned stands the Church of St  Nicholas  It is a very grand and magnifi∣cent Building being in length Yards two Foot three Quarters in breadth Yards two Foot three Quarters and of an Height equal and proportionable Who it was founded by I have no where met with but if a Conjecture may be made it was perhaps founded by  Henry  the First But be this as it will it is certain it is as old as his

Newburn  IN a Book belonging to the Vestry of St  Nicholas  it is said to be founded in the Year but what Authority this Account depends upon I know not however it is somewhat probable  THE ordering of the  Vicarage  was not 'till some Years after The King indeed in his Charter makes a general Provision of what is necessary for the  Minister  of this Church but does not say what that is This was done by  Hugh Pudsey  Bishop of  Durham  as  Thomas Hatfield  one of his Successors gave it under his Episcopal Seal at  Auckland June  th For having searched the Register of  Hugh  his Predecessor he found that he with the Con∣sent of the  Prior  and Convent of  Carlisle  order'd the  Vicarage  of St  Nicholas  in  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  on the Day before the Conversion of St  Paul  or  January

Auckland  Sexto Die Mensis  Junii  Anno Dom'    Nostrae Consecrationis quinto decimo  THE  Steeple  of this Church is in Height Yards one Foot three Quar∣ters It is supposed as to it's Model to be the most curious in the whole Kingdom It is adorned with  Pinacles  and a large and beautiful  Lanthorn  which stands upon two very bold Arches of Stone and at the Top of the said  Lanthorn  stands the tall  Spire  by much the largest belonging to the  Stee∣ple  On the Corners of the old  Tower  upon which stands the said beautiful Structure are four  Images  one at each Corner cut at length in Stone 'Tis said that  Ben Johnson  the Poet made the following Lines upon it  My  Ex Grey  Altitude High my Body four Square  My Foot in the Grave my Head in the Air  My Eyes in my Sides five Tongues in my Womb  Thirteen Heads upon my Body four Images alone  I can direct you where the Wind doth stay  And I tune God's Precepts twice aDay  I am seen where I am not I am heard where I is not  Tell me now what I am and see that you miss not  IT is said and indeed confessed that  Robert Rhodes  was more probably the Builder of this  Steeple  than any other Person His Name being at the Bottom of the  Belsry  Orate pro anima  Roberti Rhodes  BUT who this  Robert Rhodes  was is more uncertain  Grey  tells us that  Ro∣bert de Rhodes  was the Lord Prior of  Tinmouth  in  Henry  the th Days And an  Anoymous Authority  seems to suggest that this  Robert Rhodes  was one of the Bishop of  Durham  's Justices because in a Register at  Durham  there is mention made of  Robert Rhodes ab Anno    ad An'  and  Agnes  his Wife  BUT neither of these seem to me to be the true one I am rather inclina∣ble to believe that one  Robert Rhodes  Esq  who lived in this Town in the Reign of  Henry  the th was the true Person We meet with this Gentleman's Name in an Inquisition that was taken at the Castle of  Newcastle  in the th of  Henry  the th for two of the Gentlemen present were  Roger Thorn∣ton  the Son of the famous Benefactor of that Name and  Robert Rhodes  and they were also first mentioned after the Mayor  Lib de Reb  IN the Year we meet again with the same Person who together with the said  Roger Thornton  by an Instrument bearing the same Date con∣veyed some Houses for the Use of a  Chantery Priest  to pray for the Soul of  William Johnson  We have also a further Account of this Gentleman in the Year for an Instrument bearing that Date informs us that the  Mayor  and Inhabitants of  Newcastle  gave a Tenement to a Priest to live in who was to pray for the Soul of  Robert Rhodes  and  Agnes  his Wife at the Altar of St  John  the Baptist and  John  the Evangelist in St  Nicholas  Church  NOW when it is considered that this  Robert Rhodes  I am speaking of was so great a Man in this Town that he lived in the same Reign in which  Grey  acknowledges the  Lanthorne  to have been built namely in the Reign of  Hen  the th and that he was so commemorated by the  Mayor  and Inhabitants af∣ter his Decease I dare say it will appear much more probable that he was the Builder than either of the others  THERE might indeed be and probably there was a  Robert Rhodes  Prior of  Tinmouth  in the Reign of  Hen  the th but I never met with any Bene∣factions of the Priors of  Tinmouth  to the Town of  Newcastle  They were on the contrary mortal Enemies to this Place and always jealous of it's encreas∣ing Glory As to the other  Robert Rhodes  one of the  Bishop  's  Justices  he was alive in the Year which was the th of  Henry  the th and so comes too late to build a Steeple in the Reign of  Henry  the th I have been told by a worthy Gentleman and one who is curious in these Things that this  Robert Rhodes  so taken Notice of by this Town was  Escheator  THERE is a traditional Story of this Building I am now treating of which may not be improper to be here taken Notice of In the Time of the Civil Wars when the  Scots  had besieg'd the Town for several Weeks and were still as far as at first from taking it the General sent a Messenger to the May∣or or of the Town and demanded the Keys and the Delivering up of the Town or he would immediately demolish the  Steeple  of St  Nicholas  The Mayor and Aldermen upon hearing this immediately ordered a certain Number of the chiefest of the Scottish Prisoners to be carried up to the Top of the old  Tower  the Place below the  Lanthorne  and there confined after this they returned the  General  an Answer to this Purpose That they would upon no Terms de∣liver up the Town but would to the last Moment defend it That the  Steeple  of St  Nicholas  was indeed a beautiful and magnificent Piece of Architecture and one of the great Ornaments of their Town but yet should be blown into Attoms before ransom'd at such a Rate That however if it was to fall it should not fall alone that the same Moment he destroyed the beautiful Structure he should Bath his Hands in the Blood of his Countrymen who were placed there on Purpose either to preserve it from Ruin or to die along with it This Message had the desired Effect The Men were there kept Prisoners during the whole Time of the Siege and not so much as one Gun fired against it  THERE were only five Bells originally belonging to this Church but of late Years the Number is encreas'd to Eight The great Bell call'd the com∣mon Bell was sent to  Colchester  to be new cast in the Year it weighed lb They are very large ones have a bold and noble Sound and yet exceedingly sweet and Harmonious The three latter Bells were given to this Church by the  Corporation  IN the Year  William Ellison  Esq  Mayor and  Robert Sowersby  Esq  Sheriff the  Steeple  was repaired at the Expence of the  Corporation  AT the North Door of this Church it is observable that the  large Flagg  which is the first Step into the Church is cut all along the Surface with  un∣even Lines  in Imitation of the Waves of the Sea This is a silent Remem∣brancer of the  Saint  the Church is dedicated to for St  Nicholas  the Bishop of  Myra  who lived in the Time of  Constantine  the Great is so famous among some for his Miracles and Apparitions by Sea that he has merited the Title of the  Patron of the Sailors  THERE were no fewer than  Chanteries  belonging to this Church which are valued at  l    s    d per Annum  THE Chantery of St  John  the Baptist and St  John  the Apostle was on the  In Eccle∣sia Sancti  Nich  de di∣cta villa No∣vicastri ad altare Bore∣ale Joannis Baptistae Joannis A∣post E∣vangel lib Cart p  Northside of the Church It is said to have been founded by  Robert Rhodes  and  Agnes  his Wife and licensed by King  Henry  the th If there be any Truth in this it is that he was a third Founder He allowed a Priest  l    s    d per Annum  to pray for his Soul and the Soul of his Wife and the Town of  Newcastle  as it is said above out of Respect to his Memory gave the Priest a House to live in but it's a Mistake that this  Chantery  was not founded before for  Richard de Emeldon  who had been above Times Mayor of  Newcastle  was permitted by Letters Patents from King  Edward  the d to build upon a Piece of vacant Ground over against the Chapel of St  Thomas  the Martyr that he might present it to  Three Chaplains  to procure their Prayers for him whilst he was living and after he was dead and also for the Souls of his Wives and his Father and Mother  c  every Day at the Al∣tar in St  Nicholas  which was dedicated to  John  the Baptist and  John  the Apostle and Evangelist This Gentleman died about the th or th of the Reign now mentioned as is clearly gathered from the Authority above and the Letters in which this Chantery is mentioned bear Date the th of this Reign and therefore it is a Mistake to suppose this Chantery founded in the Reign of  Henry  the th which was almost an hundred Years after  THE Priests set apart to attend this Altar were every Day to pray for his Soul and the others abovementioned and by an Order from the Then  Ri∣chard  Lord Bishop of  Durham  the Chaplains for the Time being were obli∣ged on the  Anniversary Day  of his Death every Year for Ever to celebrate his Memory with a  Solemn tolling of the Bells  and  devoutly singing by Note  in the  Evening of the Anniversary  and on the  Anniversary itself  and solemnly to sing Mass for the Soul of  Richard  himself and the Souls abovementioned and the Souls of all the Faithful departed And after Mass one of the Chaplains was to distribute among  an hundred and sixty poor People  the Sum of Six Shillings and Eightpence and this annually for ever This together with several o∣ther Things was ordered by  Richard  Bishop of  Durham  in the d Year of his Consecration  Anno  which was with all other Things mentioned in the Charter confirmed by  Edward  the d in the th Year of his Reign  THUS then it appears that this Chantery is of a much older Date than the Reign of  Henry  the Sixth But this is not all  Richard de Emeldon  was but a second Founder of this Chantery It boasts still an higher Antiquity and is said to have been founded by  Laurence  of  Durham  who was Prior of  Durham  in the Year which by the way is a further Proof of our Conjecture of this Church's being founded by King  Henry  the First or in that Reign at latest  THE Chantery of St  Catherine  was founded by  William Johnson  and  I∣sabel  his Wife in the Reign of  Edward  the Third it's yearly Value was  l    s Roger Thornton  the Son of  Roger  the great Benefactor in a Deed dated  December  the th is made together with some others a

Thomas Ireland  late Incumbent there But however we may give some Guess at the Time of it For  Lib Cart p  there is mention made of it and of two Shillings a Year given to it in a Charter which was signed by  Nicholas de Carleol  then Capital Bailiff of the Town in the Year and in the Year  Peter Graper  then Mayor of the Town gave  Et cuidam Capellano celebranti divina ad al∣tare Beatae Mariae

St  Nicholas  So that it must at latest have been founded in the Reign of King  Edward  the First That large  Porch  on the Southside of the Church or the SouthCross of the Church as it is called is the Chantery of St  Mary  's the yearly Value of it was  l    s    STEPHEN Whitgray  and  Mary  his Wife founded the Chantery of St  Margaret  in the Southside of the Church of St  Nicholas  in the

constituted  John de Etell  Chaplain of this Chantery to pray for their Souls and the Souls of the faithful departed The Value of this Chan∣tery was Marks yearly which was raised out of certain Tenements  viz  out of one near the  Calecross  and from a Tenement which paid somewhat to the  Chantery  of St  Eligie  in the Church of  AllHallows  in this Town and from another Tenement near the  CaleCross  which lay near  Grundonchare  and from another Tenement overagainst St  Nicholas  Church and from ano∣ther Tenement in  Hackergate  near the Chapel of  AllSaints  and from a Te∣nement near

Rhodes  the Builder of the upper Part of the Steeple for his Coat of Arms and probably his Wife's too is quartered on the Basis of it  ON the  NorthIsle  answering to the Nave or Body of this Church is a large Gallery which is chiefly for the Use of the Boys of the Grammar School At the Eastend of which an Addition was made to it by the Rev Dr  Tom∣linson  for the Use of his Successor the Lecturer of St  Nicholas  and his own Family  IN the  Roodloft  or the Gallery which seperates the Chancel from the Nave of the Church now called the Organloft is a  Double Organ  ON the Northside of this Organ is a Porch called  Saint George  's  Porch  which was built as  Grey  informs us by  one of the Kings of this Land  It has undoubtedly been one of the ancient Chanteries for several of them were si∣tuated thereabouts between the Gallery and this Porch as some others of them were in  St Mary  's  Porch  or the South Cross of the Church It hath under it a Vault and there is on the North Windows the  Head of the King  the Father of the Lady which  St George  delivered from the  Dragon  ON the East Windows is still remaining some of the painted Glass There is particularly the Picture of  Saint Laurence  and some  Skinmarks  and  Coats of Arms  It has been a beautiful little Place It is ceiled at the Top and has been surrounded with carv'd Work in Wood some of which still remains to speak the Curious Art and commendable Expence of the Days of old  THE  Chancel  of this Church is a very noble and stately one The Altar was in the Year very sumptuously and yet decently adorn'd At the  Top is the Word  Jehovah  and under that in a Glory a Part of the Name of Lord which he himself proclaimed before  Moses The Lord God merciful and gracious  What is below that again see in the Altar of  Allhallows  The PLATE for the Altar  TWO Flaggons Three Challices and Covers Three Salvers A small Spoon Drainer  ON the  South  Side of the  Chancel  is the  Vestry  above which is the  Library  The Keeper of which is the Rev Mr  Stoddard  Assistant Curate of this Church  IN this are several good Books and some  Manuscripts  But it is not at pre∣sent any way comparable to what it will be hereafter either for Variety or Number of Books of all Kinds of Learning The worthy and learned Dr  Tomlinson  being expected to leave at his Death to this Library his whole Study which is perhaps considering the vast Number of Books their be∣ing so well chosen so neatly and curiously Bound their great Variety being of all Manner of Subjects treating of all Arts and Sciences a Library out∣done by few private Gentlemen in the Kingdom  Grey  IN this Church are many sumptuous Windows but that in the East sur∣passeth all the Rest in Height Largeness and Beauty This Author says that there were in this Window the Twelve  Apostles  and the seven Deeds of  Charity  I suppose he Means painted upon the Glass He tells us also that this Window was built by the Beneficent  Roger Thornton  the Elder and that there was this Inscription on it  Orate pro anima  Rogeri  de  Thornton  pro animabus Filiorum Filiarum  At present there is nothing remaining of these Pictures but two Heads which if we may Judge of the Rest by them will speak them to have been very Tall and curiously done The Inscription is intirely gone  AN Indulgence of Days was granted by twelve Foreign  Bishops  and confirmed by  Thomas Hatfield  Bishop of  Durham  to all such having re∣pented and confessed their Sins as performed the following Things  viz  If  they came to this Church to  Mass  to  Prayers

from the Country to carry on the War of  Britany  the Vulgar conceiving him to be the Cause of that Task tumultuously murdered him at  Cockledge  near  Threske  eighteen Miles north of  York  upon the Day of St  Vitalis  the Martyr whereupon he was buried at  Beverley  where he hath a stately Monument but much defaced This is Shrine at present much more so being no where to be met with bul  Grey  tells us that in this Part of the Church there was such a Monument in his Time that was made in Memory of him in his own Country he having a House in this Town and Parish and that Part of the Inscription upon it was  Orate pro anima Hemici Percy    Northumbriae qui per Rebbelium Manus occabuit  c  THE  Milbank  Manuscript says it was in the north Corner of the Church That it was a Monument of Wood on which was painted an  old Man  our  Saviour  on his right Hand and the  Virgin Mary  on his Left There came a Labil from her Mouth but what it was this Authority had forgot but that from our  Saviour  's was  Quaeso Patri sac qued rog it mea Mater  THEN followed some Latin Verses done in the rhiming Way of the Monks but they are so dark and obscure that little can be made of them the Manuscript goes on When Mr  William Selby  was buried this Monu∣ment was removed out of that Corner and Sir  George Selby  did set his mag∣nificent Tomb there Alter that it was placed against the Wall next to Sir  George  's Tomb and so continued 'till Mr  Lane Hodshon  got leave of Vicar  Nailor  to remove it and place his Father Where it is now I know not  Grey  tells us that the  Parson  of the Town is the Bishop of  Carlisle  who hath his  Vicar  or  Substitute  How this Bishop came to have this Living in his Gift I have shewed in the Beginning of our Account of this Church  UPON this Church depend the other Churches for the  Vicar  has Dues from them all And yet they are each of them a distinct Parish from St  Ni∣cholas  THIS  Vicarage  is reckoned  l per Ann  and the Corporation

he was a Man of great Piety and Worth Industry and Ability a great Master of the Fathers and profoundly read in Theology as appears from his many learned Treatises  YEILDARD Alvey  Vicar was buried at St  Nicholas  he succeeded in the Vicarage of  Newcastle  in the Year when the most learned Dr  Jackson  was elected President of  Corpus Christi  College in  Oxford  his Suf∣ferings began very early in the Troubles  Vide Ann  as I find by a Letter of his writ∣ten to his Grace the Archbishop of  Canterbury  and dated from  York Oct  wherein he sets forth what he then had suffer'd in the following Manner  I am for the present outed of all my spiritual Promotions to the yearly Value of  l  and have most of my moveable Goods seized upon by the Rebels be∣ing forc'd upon some threatning Speeches given out by them that they would deal more rigourously with me than others suddenly to desert all and to provide for the Safety of my self Wife and seven Children by a speedy Flight in the Nighttime how they would have dealt with me they have since made evident by their harsh dealing with two of my Curates whom I left to officiate for me in my Absence who have not only been interrupted in reading Divine Service but threatn'd to be Pistol'd if they would not desist from the Execution of their Office And whereas I had lately purchased    Pounds  per Annum  in  Northumberland  and hoped to have been supplied that Way in these calamitous Times 'till I might with Safety re∣turn they have since I presented my Petition to his Majesty seized upon that also and commanded my Servant to be accountable to them for it This is my Case at this Time  Afterwards as might be expected it was far worse for as I am otherwise inform'd he was not only pull'd out of this Pulpit by two Holy Sisters but imprison'd at  Newcastle  at  HolyIsland  and at  Norwich  his Fa∣mily increas'd under his Troubles if I mistake not to ten Children for so many I find his Wife bore him in all which were reduced to great Streights and subsisted in good measure by Charity I perceive by the Letter above∣mentioned that he had been active as well as passive in the Service of his Ma∣jesty by both which Means he had so far recommended himself to the Fa∣vour and Esteem of that Prince that he had design'd some Reward for him which in all Probability the Rebellion prevented the King from bestowing Nor did Mr  Alvey  live to receive it from his royal Son on the Restoration for his Death happened in the Year and was hastened as 'tis thought by his Sufferings He was a very Honest Good Man and a true Son of

is the  Netherdeanbridge  which you descend into by some Stairs that lead from the  Churchyard  IT is called so because it goes over the  Dean  or  Syke  lower down the Town than the other Bridge for as the  Higherbridge  has the Name of the  Upperdeanbridge  because it is higher in the Town so this being lower in the Town has the Name of the  Netherdeanbridge  It is a little narrow Lane which leads into  Pilgrimstreet  Formerly when the Merchants had their Shops and Warehouses in the  Fleshmarket  the River ebb'd and flow'd above this Bridge and the Boats came under it with the Wares and Commodities of the Mer∣chants But it is chiefly Famous because the  Roman Wall  went along it It came from the Vicar's Garden through the Body of St  Nicholas  Church then along this Street and so on into  Pandon  As you descend the Stairs aforemention'd into this Lane there is an  Almshouse  on the left Hand for two or three poor Women but it has no Allow∣ance  CHAP VIII  Of PILGRIMSTREET  T  HIS Street got it's Name from the  Pilgrims  who came from all parts of this Kingdom to worship at our  Lady  's  Chapel  at  Gesmond  or  Jesu∣munde  or as it is called in some ancient Writings  Je∣sumuth  is it pleasant Vil∣lage on the NorthEast of  Newca∣stle  Distant from it about    Miles it appertained to the Barony of  Robert de Gaugy  as appears by a Certificate given in the Third of  Hen  the d of such Manours as his Barony did consist of for which he was obliged to the Service of  Three Knights Fees  Mag Brit Vol  Adamus de Athol  who lies buried in the Chapel of the  Holy Trinity  in St  Andrew  's Church lived in this Village and is called  Dominus de Jesmond  The  Orde  's Family was also in Possession of it  There are still to be seen the Ruins of the  Chapel  and  Hospital  of our  Lady  in this Village The  Hospital  is now a Dwellinghouse but the Chapel is chang'd into something worse being turn'd into a Stable  I am told and it is very probable that this  Chapel  and  Hospital  are at present the Property of Mr  Robert Andrew  of  Gateshead  Gesmond  THERE was an Inn in this Street which the  Pilgrims  in their Journey were wont to call at which occasioned their constant coming up this Street and so it got it's Name of  Pilgrimstreet  as the  Inn  did that of the  Pilgrims Inn  As you descend this Street you have on the left Hand a Passage to the  Carliolcroft  which is a large Field formerly the Property of the  Carliols  now of  John Rogers  Esq  bounded on one Side with the Town's Walls and on the other by the  Gardens  on this Side of  Pilgrimstreet  ON that Side of it next the  TownWall  is a very agreeable Walk gene∣rally frequented in a Summer's Evening by the  Gentry  of this Part of the Town The Prospect of the Gardens some of which are exceeding Curious afford∣ing a good deal of Pleasure  THERE is a Passage from this Field into the  ManourChare  In the Year    Sir  In the d th and th of  Edward  the  First Robert de Hilton  of  Hilton  in the County Palatine of  Durham  had Summons to Parliament amongst the Ba∣rons of this Realm and in the th of  Edward  the d was in that Expedition then made into  Scotland  This  Robert  married  Margaret  one of the Three Coheitesses to  Marmaduke de Thwenge  and left issue Two Daugh∣ters his Heirs  viz Isabel  married to  Walter de Pen∣wardyn  and  Maud  to  Hotham  After this there is mention made of  Alexander de Hilton  who in the th of  Edward  the  Third  served in the Scottish Wars with  Ralph  Lord  Nevil  and had Sum∣mons to Parliament in the th and th of  Edward  the  Third  but no longer  This is in all Probability the same  Alexander  with him above mentioned  The present Gentlemen  John Hilton  Esq  a regular Descendant of this ancient Family lives in the Place of his Ancestors which he has adorned and Beautified beyond what was done in past Ages in particular the  Chapel  famous in this Country for it's  IrishWood  is so furnished with  Place  and  Books  and  other Necessaries  that it Merits the Character of a very beautiful  Cha∣pel  This Family is the ancientest in  England  that bears a Coat of Arms  Alexander  of  Hilton  and  Matilda  his Wife the two Patrons of the  Chapel  of  Ges∣monde  presented to it one Sir  William  of  Heighington  to be Chap∣lain who was accordingly instituted by  Thomas Hatfield  Bishop of  Durham  and after that inducted as was attested at  Auckland June  the  th  But on the th of the Month following he gave it up declaring he had no right or Title to it The Copy of the Original of this Account I had from Dr  Hunter  of  Durham  and is as follows  UNiversis S Matris filiis ad quos praesentes Literae pervene∣rint Thomas permissione Divina  Dunelm'  Episcopus salu∣tem in amplexibus Salvatoris

headed by some of the  Aldermen  and principal Men of the Town came to kill the  Prior  of  Tinmouth  in the first of the Reign of King  Henry  the Eighth as may be seen in that Year  In the d of  Edw  th the Town got a Grant of the  Chapel  of the Blessed  Mary  of  Jesmond  and some Messuages and Lands in  Jesmond  under an annual Rent of  s d  payable out of some Lands in old  Heaton  and the  Chapel  or  Chantery  of St  Laurence  with the Messuages called St  Laurence  and  Little St Anne's Close  and Lands in  Byker  then in the Possession of  Henry Winklive  and Lands in  Killingworth  then in the Possession of  John Humley  an annual Rent  s  payable oat of the Lands of the then  Christopher Mitford  in  OldHeaton  These were granted in Consideration of  l s d  In the same Year the Mayor and Burgesses granted the Hospital of the Blessed  Mary  of  Jesmond  with the Lands and Grounds belonging to it to Sir  John Brandling  his Heirs and Assigns for ever  The Gentleman of this Place at present is  William Coulson  Esq  who lately built a very pretty House and accommodated it with Gardens  St  Mary  's Well in this Village which is said to have had as many Steps down to it as there are  Articles  in the  Creed  was lately inclos'd by Mr  Coulson  for a BathingPlace which was no sooner done than the Water left it This occasioned strange Whispers in the Village and the adjacent Place The Well was always esteemed of more Sanctity than common Wells and therefore the Failing of the Water could be looked upon its nothing less than a just Revenge for so great a Prophanation But alas the Miracle's at an End for the Water returned awhile ago in as great Abundance as ever  Sect I  ON the Righthand as you descend from this Gate of  Pilgrimstreet  is the  HighFrierChare  which leads into  Newgatestreet  There was in this Lane a  Fryery  which occasioned it's Name  IT was situated somewhere about  FicketTower  which is the next round Tower to  Pilgrimgate  THIS appears from the Account of the Ward belonging to this Tower a Part of which is as follows  It shall have to Ward  c  with all  GreyFryerChare  from the  Barras  opposite to the  FicketTower  and the North Kirk Door of the said Fryery Westward and no farther Eastward in that Lane  GREY  in this Part of the Town says that in the Upperpart of this Street is a Princely House built out of the Ruins of the BlackFryers  THIS is contrary to the Authority above where it is called the  GreyFryerChare  AND besides it is contrary to several ancient Writings which call this Chare  Vicus qui ducit ad Fratres minores  or the Chare of the  Vide  Newgate  GreyFryers  so that it is as great a Mistake to place the  BlackFryers  here as to say the  GreyFryers  were placed in  Westgate  Their Situation according to the Authority above must have been in the Garden of  Walter Blacket  Esq  in that Part of it which is opposite to  FicketTower  and the rest of that Garden must have been the Garden and other Conveniencies of this Monastery This House was founded by the Family of the  Carliols  in the Reign of King  Henry  the d for they were as appears from ancient Writings a Regular and well settled Body in the Year  THEY were originally Merchants of this Town and afterwards landed Men  TWO of this Family succeeded  Peter Scott  who was the First Mayor of  Newcastle  and Mayor for three Years from the Year to the Year  THIS Situation is also confirmed by the  Milbank  Manuscript which says that this Fryery was near to  Pilgrimstreetgate  and that there is a little Lane be∣tween it and the Walls wherein there is an  Almshouse  but now both the Fryery and it are converted to private Uses  THIS  Almshouse  flourished as late as Queen  Mary  's Days for 'tis said in a Writing belonging to Mr  Richard Wall  of this Town the Proprietor of these Houses that in the Year in the Reign of  Philip  and  Mary  it was inha∣bited by poor Religious Women  Inhabitant nunc    Pauperes mulieres Deo servientes  THE  GreyFryers  or as they are properly called the  Franciscans  received their Name from St  Francis  born in the Dutchy of  Spoletum  in  Italy  who was canonized by Pope  Gregory  the  Ninth  about two Years after whose Death the  Franciscans  came into  England  and one  Diggs  Ancestor of Sir  Dudley Diggs  bought for them their first Seat in  Canterbury

WHILST this Order flourish'd in  England  this  Province  was divided into  Pacts  or  Districts  called  Custodies  because each of them was governed by the  Provincial  who had charge of them all by a particular superior called  Custos  or  Keeper  who had the Power over all the Convents within his  District  or  Custody  The  Custodies  are as follows The Custody or Wardenship of  London  had

Wit made for Learning and wonderful Subtle and Sharp When he had studied some Years with great Advantage at  Oxford  he returned into  Northumberland  his native Country as some will have it and took upon him the Habit of St  Francis  at  Newcastle  Being afterwards sent to  Oxford  he again fell to his Studies with great Vehemency 'till he ar∣rived to be Doctor and Professor of Divinity Thus he st expounded the Master of Sentences at  Oxford  and afterwards in the Year being ap∣pointed Professor at  Paris  by the General of the Order in the Chapter in  Toulouse  he there taught a Course of Divinity Thirdly he did the same at  Cologne  with wonderful Applause at which Time there arose at  Cologne  the Controversy about the Conception of the Blessed Virgin  Mary  whether she was conceived in original Sin or not All the followers of  Albertus Magnus  af∣firm'd that she was  Scotus  and his Adherents positively asserted the contrary Here it was that he gained the Title of Dr  Subtilis  he publish'd a Lecture on  Genesis Commentaries on the Gospels  in Books Several Books on the Epi∣stles of St  Paul  Sermons of Saints and of Particular Times Two or three Pieces on the Master of

were built by Sir  Wm Blacket  Bart the Grand Father of the present Possessor  Walter Blacket  Esq  THE Authority above says also that it is a Princely House and indeed it is no less than very stately and magnificent being supposed the most so of any House in the whole Kingdom within a walled Town It is surrounded with a vast Quantity of Ground that Part of it which Faces the Street is thrown into Walks and Grass Plats beautified with Images and beset with Trees which afford a very pleasing Shade The other Part of the Ground on the West Side of it is all a Garden exceedingly neat and curious adorned with many and the most beautiful Statues and several other Curiosities  BUT this House is not more remarkable or memorable upon any Account than for it's having been the Lodgings of King  Charles  the First whilst he was Prisoner at this Town  ON this same Side of the Street a little below the House now mentioned is the  UpperDeanBridge  which leads into the  Middlestreet Pullenmarket Fleshmarket  c From hence downwards is the most beautiful Part of the Street the Houses on each Side of it being most of them very pretty neat and regular such are the Houses of Mr  Edward Harl  Mr  Thomas Biggs John Rogers  Esq  Thomas Clennell  Esq  Nicholas Fenwick  Esq  Nathaniel Clay∣ton  Esq  Edward Collingwood  Esq  Mr  Perith  Mr  John White John Ogle  Esq  Mr  Thomas Waters Matthew White  Esq  c But there is one House in particular which must be distinguished from the others for it's great Anti∣quity and that is the House abovementioned called the  Pilgrim  's  Inn  It is on the West Side of the Street and adjoins to the North Side of the House  of Mr  Edward Callingwood  just now mentioned and is exactly Yards one Foot from the Southmost Corner of  UpperDeanBridge  It is holden of the Dean and Chapter of  Durham  and belongs at present to Mr  James Hargrave  Sect III  BELOW this House on the other Side of the Street is a Lane called  Manour Chare  which leads from  Pilgrimstreet  to St  Austin Fryers  A little below the Eastend of this  Chare  on the Right Hand is the  Tay∣lors Meetinghouse  It was formerly at the very End of the  Chare  in that House which Fronts  Pilgrimstreet  which by the Marks still remaining of a large  Window  seems to have been a  Chapel  as well as by the Tradition of the People thereabouts There is a Writing in the Custody of this ancient Fraternity which I have copied for the Curiosity of it and is as follows  TO THE WORSHIP OF GOD  and the Sustentation of the Procession of  Corpus Christi  Plays in the Town of  Newcastle

likewise the said Alderman to this Ordinance have set their  Seals and written their own Names with their own Hand the last Day of  Janu∣ary  and in the Twenty Eighth Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord King  Henry  after the Conquest of  England  the Eighth  A little below this Hall of the Taylors and the Appurtenances thereof was probably the House of  Laurentius Acton  which border'd on the  South  upon the House of the present Mr  Thomas Waters  This  Laurentius  was Mayor of  Newcastle  in the Reign of  Henry  the th Opposite to this House of  Laurentius Action  is the Market for Wheat and Rye every  Tuesday  and  Saturday  BELOW this again are  three narrow Lanes  two on the Westside of the Street and one on the East Those on the West are the  NetherDeanBridge  leading into St  Nicholas  Churchyard which has been spoken of before and the  PainterHugh  or as it is called in a Writing as old as  Edward  the Third's Reign  Payntourhogh  which leads into the Street called the  Side  It is from  Pilgrimstreet  a very great Descent into the  Side  but it is made tollerably easy by having  Stairs  on one Side of it It seems to have got it's Name from the River flowing by the Bottom of it up to the  NetherDeanBridge  c For  Hugh  signifies a  SteepHill  or  Bank  and  Painter  is a Term made use of by the  Sailors  for a  Rope  which they fasten the Boat with This Street therefore was called the  PainterHugh  because it was the  Hugh  which the  Painters  were made fast to  ONE  William Porter  had a House at the End of this Street which he granted to  John de Chambers  a Burgess of this Town in the Reign of King  Edward  the Third  Anno  on Condition that he paid to the  Prioress  and Convent of  Lambly  eighteen Shillings  per Annum  THE other Lane or Street on the East of this Street is  Silverstreet  close by the Northside of  Allhallows Churchyard  it leads into  Pandon  It is said but very improbably to have got it's Name of  Silverstreet  because of the  Fishmarket  which was kept a little below it at the  StockBridge  It was anciently called  AllHallowgate  for  AllHallowgate  is said to be  Ex parte Boreali Ecclesiae omnium Sanctorum  it was also called  Templegate  Mr  Nicholas Lamb  whose House is in this Street finds it called  Jewgate  in his Writings but when or for what Reason it bore that Name I know not  WE come now to the  Church  of  AllHallows  which stands a little below  Silverstreet  and on the same Side of the Street with it  viz  at the very Bot∣tom of this  Pilgrimstreet  Sect IV  Of  ALLHALLOWS CHURCH  WHO this Church was founded by I have met with no Account nor any of the Time it was built in only this is certain it must have been built before the Year but how long before I know not For in that Year I meet with an Account of  Mr  Smith  P  the  Churchyard  of  AllHallows  which is a plain Proof that the Church was then in Being  GREY  is of Opinion that it was dedicated to  AllHallows  or  AllSaints  from the ancient Name of that Part of the  Town Pampedon  which he says was so called from  imagining I suppose that it was so cal∣led  of the  Romans  AllHallows  Church  who inhabited this Part of the Town after the  Temple  at  Rome  the  Pantheon  which was dedicated to  all the Gods  THIS Church is seated upon a Hill which is much about the same Height with the Situation of St  Mary  's in  Gateshead  and upon the same Line with it  IT is not so long as St  Nicholas  being only Yards one Foot a Quar∣ter long but it is broader as being Yards two Foot broad The  Steeple  is but or a mean Height being a Square Tower with only one  Spire  arising from it The Bells belonging to this Church were founded in the Year They were cast out of the Metal of that famous  Statue  of King  James  the Second which stood on the  SandHill  They were founded in the Ground belonging to St  Austin Fryers  in that Part of it which is in the Backside of the  Hospital  of the  Holy Jesus  Their Sound is not so Melodious as the o∣thers in this Town but the Note is exceedingly exact and more tuneful than the others  WHATEVER  Robert Rhodes  did to this  Steeple  his Name is under the Bel∣fry of it as at St  Nicholas  In one of the Registers belonging to this Church of  AllHallows  we have the following Account About the  Round  where the Bells are drawn up into the Bellhouse in the  Steeple  there is written  Orate pro anima Roberti Rhodes  His  Arms  are also without at the Eastend of the Church on the  Breast  of an  Angel  which as I take it is a  Tyger  or  Greyhound  on a  Chief  and  three Annulets  on the  Escutcheon  The like is in St  Nicholas  Church  c  In St  John  's also on the Outside of the  South Porch  overagainst the  Almshouse  there is on a Square  Orate pro anima Roberti Rhodes  I have also seen the same in  Tinmouth Castle  in a  Round  on the Northside after you are within the Gate upon the  Wall  which belike was in some Part of that great  Church  when it was a  Cell  of St  Alban  's  UPON the Eastend of the  Chancel  in the Southeast Window there was the Picture of our Saviour at large but in the Time of the  Rebellion  it was wholly taken away  NEXT to it as you go up the Southside there was the Picture of a  Boy  standing upon chequer'd Pavement as it seemed and on the Glass under him  Like as the  Jamen  moist and cold  Is full of Tempest Day by Day  So is one Child of ten Years old  Hath no Understanding but all on Play  THE same Authority adds I suppose the rest of the Months were also in this Window in former Times but I have seen it only and it was taken a∣way also in the Time of the Rebellion  IN the Window above the South Door which leads into the Quire to∣wards the Porch were the Pictures of  Roger Thornton  's Children  Two Men  and  Three Women  Kneeling at Altars There remain now only  Two  of the Women  THERE are higher up this Isle in the Windows towards the Porch some Characters one is like an I with an S through it and other  Three Chara∣cters  which are the Merchants  Skinmark  for they are but a little Different from the  Skinmark  which is upon the Stone of  Christopher Elmer  It is a Token that some Merchant was a Benefactor to the Church and perhaps some Part of the South Wall of the Church I take it to be the  Skinmark  of  Roger Thornton  for the very same is in the  Chantery  of St  Peter  overagainst his Tomb  TRADITION says that from the Westend of the Vestry to the Porch the old South Wall was taken away and rebuilt further into the Churchyard  by  Roger de Thornton  That the old Wall was farther into the Church than the Wall now is is plain from the Piece of it now remaining which is on the Eastend of the  Vestry  and I think the Pictures in the Windows a∣bovementioned is a good Confirmation of the Truth of the Tradition of the Builder In that Window next the Porch Door but one there have been the Pictures of the  Twelve Apostles  There are now only remaining St  Matthew  St  James  the Less St  Andrew  St  Philip  St  James  Major and another  THERE are three Galleries in this Church one on the Westend and another on the Eastend of the Nave and the other in the NorthIsle That on the Westend was built in the Year The  Organ  which was plac'd in the middle of it was built at the same Time It is a very long Gallery and by much the most beautiful in the Church On the Northend of it are the Seats of the Children belonging to the  CharitySchool  The Gallery on the Westend is called the  Butchers Gallery  THE other Gallery on the NorthIsle is the  Sailors Gallery  It is said in a Memorandum made at the Bottom of it to have been  built and finished by the  Trinityhouse  in  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  in the Year  John Holbourne  then Master  It was beautified in the Year  Robert Bailiff  being then Ma∣ster with three or four Devices on the Southside of it One Pannel has the Picture of  St  Paul  's Shipwreck  another our  Saviour's being asleep in the Storm  then there is the Arms of the  Trinityhouse  another Draught is that of our Saviour's taking  Peter by the Hand when he was sinking in the Waves  and the other is that of  Jonah vomited up upon the dry Land  THE  Chancel  of this Church stands upon a large  Vault  which consists of a  pretty long Entrance arched at the Top  and of a  pretty large Square Room with a curious Pillar in it  which is the grand Support of eight large  Stone Arches  The Entrance into this  vault  is in the  Churchyard  on the  Northside  of it  AS you enter into the  Chancel  from the  Nave  of the Church you have on the left Hand of you an  old Pair of Stairs  to which are adjoining the  Stairs  of the  Butchers Gallery  These  Stairs  formerly led into the same Place but then it was into a  Gallery  different from what the  Butchers Gallery  is now They led into a  Loft  or  Gallery  called the  Rood Loft  THE  Rood  was an Image of our Saviour upon the Cross made generally of  Wood  and placed on a  Loft  made for that Purpose just over the Passage out of the  Church  into the  Chancel  out of this Mystery they say that the  Church  represents the  Church Militant  and the  Chancel  the  Church Triumphant  and who will pass out of the Former into the Latter must go under the  Rood Loft  that is they must go under the  Cross and suffer Affliction  This  Image  was wont to have the  Virgin Mary  on one Side of it and St  John  on the o∣ther  Stavely C Hist P    A few Years ago the  Chancel  was beautifyed It is pannel'd round with Wainscot The Table is a large curious  Marble Stone  which was given to the Church for that Use by an unknown Hand On the large Pannel im∣mediately above the  Altar  is this Figure  I  H  S  or  Jesus Hominum Salvator  Above that again is the Picture of a  Dove  cu∣riously carved in  Wood  and above that again in a  Golden Glory  is the great Name of God  which signifies his most absolute self Existence  He was and is and is to come  THIS is to point out by way of Emblem the Persons of the  Trinity  God the Father by the Word  JEHOVAH  he having order'd  Moses  when  he went to the  Israelites  to bring them out of  Egypt  to say  I  Exod iii  AM hath sent thee  or the Lord  Jehovah  who exists eternally or always is The  Dove  is the Emblem of the  Holy Ghost  for he is said to have descended  in a bodily Shape like a  Mark iii  Dove  And the Letters with the Cross in the Middle of them Point out the second Person of the  glorious Trinity  who dyed upon the Cross for the Sins of the World  ON the Top

is indeed impossible for any Man living to tell But as for the CatherineWheels it is easy to conclude that they are plac'd on the SouthEast end of the Church to signify that St  Catherine  's Chantery

Mari∣ners  became a Body and their House was called the  Trinityhouse  we find an Altar in it dedicated to the  Trinity  for in one of their Writings 'tis said that  Thomas Hebborne  should be Partaker of all  Masses GoodPrayers  and  Suffrage  which should afterwards be celebrated said and done by the  Chaplain  and  Priest  of the said Fraternity within the  Trinityhouse  and at the  TrinityAltar  within the Church of  AllHallows  for evermore  I know not where to fix the Place of this Altar any more than I can fix particularly the Places of some of the ancient Chanteries except it was as some will naturally Conjecture in the  Porch  behind their  Gallery  And yet there are some Reasons against this Supposition For this  Porch  was a  Chan∣tery  they had only an  Altar  and as a  Chantery  it must have been filled with a  Priest  who had an  Altar  to himself and consequently their  Altar  must have been some where else If it be said that they perhaps built this  Porch  I an∣swer that if they had done so it would have been called a  Chantery  not on∣ly an  Altar  Besides the Building is visibly older than their  Chapel  their  Priest  or their  Altar  For they can scarce be supposed to have had any one of the  Three  before the Beginning of the Reign of King  Henry  the Eighth and that's a Date too late for so old a Piece of Building  Of the  Burial Places  and

like that of  Roger Thornton  all the Difference is that the Gown of this Picture is not so deep as that of  Thornton  's He conjectures it to be the burial Place of  Robert Rhodes  because of the Words  Promotor Ecclesiarum  lib  AllHall'  The Words  Promotor Ecclesiarum  are not now to be found How∣ever had they been there still I think they are but a weak Argument to prove that  Robert Rhodes  was buried here when it is considered that he founded a Chantery in St  Nicholas  that his own Soul and his Wife's might be prayed for For People were generally buried in the same Church and near the very Place where they erected a Chantery or an Altar  BUT whoever it is this I think may be safely concluded from the Gran∣deur of the  Grave Stone  that he was some wealthy Person and from his be∣ing  Promotor Ecclesiarum  that he was also Religious  THE  Effigies  is very Tall and is surrounded with very curious Pictures of the Saints and some other Things but the Brass is now tearing off and going very fast into Ruin It is a pity it should not have more care taken of it as it is an Ornament to the Church and the Monument of it's Benefactor The  Promoters  of  Churches  should be

Church every Day at o'Clock in the Mor∣ning and in the Afternoon The Sacrament is administred at this Church every second Sunday in the Month It was formerly usual for the Town to present this Church at the  High Festival of Easter  with twenty one Gallons of Wine  OPPOSITE to the  West Stairs  of this Church is an  AlmsHouse  which was in good Repair as we are informed by the  Milbank  Manuscript about Years ago at which Time the  ChurchWardens  allowed them  s per Annum  for Coals for four Women It is now in very bad Repair and go∣ing fast into Ruins At present the People in it are allowed eight Chaldron of Coals  per Annum  and three Shillings  per  Quarter by the Churchwardens  ON the  Southside  of this Church are two Pair of Stairs those opposite to the  QuireDoor  lead into a narrow Street called the  Dogbank  but former∣ly as appears by some ancient Writings  Silverstreet  The other Pair lead into the  ButcherBank  which is a narrow Street and a great Descent It is mostly inhabited by  Butchers  who have their Shops and Houses there In this are many narrow Lanes called  Chares  which lead into the  Keyside  This leads into the Street called the  Side  and into the  Sandhill  It was called formerly  AllHallows Bank  CHAP IX  Of the CASTLEYARD  I  N order now to go regularly down into the lower Parts of the Town let us set off from the Southside of the Steeple of St  Nicholas  which leads dire∣ctly to the Top of the Street called the  Side  Whilst I am here I can't help observing that were the Hou∣ses belonging to Mr  Partis  c which are situated from the Porch Door of St  Nicholas  to the said Street taken away the Belfry and Steeple would look much more grand and magnificent and whereas this  Great Ornament  of the Town is now almost hid as a Traveller comes up this Street it would then be wholly expos'd and strike the Beholders with Awe and Wonder  AFTER you have crossed the upper Part of this Street there is a Passage leading to  BailiffGate  which has a Turn upon the Lefthand that goes into the  Castleyard  the Place where is situated the  Castle  of this Town  BEFORE the Conquest the old  Round Tower  was probably in Being and was the  old Castle  or  Fort  of  Monkchester  and after the Conquest when the other Castle was built it was called to distinguish it from the  old Castle  the  NewCastle  which in a small Time after gave Name to the whole Place Some∣thing to this Purpose are these two or three Words about it in the Manu∣script of  John Milbank  Esq  That this new Castle may be distinguished from the old one  The Use of this Tower as the same Authority informs us was made to secure the  Pass  to the  Bridge  in former Times  THIS  new Castle  was built by  Robert Curthois  the Son of  William  the Con∣queror in the Year as has been before observed But notwithstanding this and that it gives a new Name to the Place yet whatever Priviledges be∣longed to  Monkchester  for so the Town was then called continued with it nor did the  Castle  impair them in the least  De reb Novocast  IT has been a Building of very great Strength and very fit for what it was design'd and yet in the Reign of King  John  we have an Account of it's being repair'd by that King and that he was obliged in the making of a  Ditch  to destroy divers Houses for which he satisfied the Owners as may be seen in our Account of that King's Charter to this Town  THE first Account we meet with of it after it was built is of it's being be∣sieged by  William Rufus  For  Robert Mowbray  Earl of  Northumberland  having opposed him he came down and laid Siege to the Castle and con∣quer'd  Newcastle  upon which  Robert  fled and absconded in  BamburghCastle  but was afterwards taken by the King's Party and carried Prisoner to  Windsor  AMONG several Rents and Revenues arising to this Castle the following were some  THE Barony of the  William Herron Hen I eum Feost  Herons  which contain'd  One  Wil∣liam  regular∣ly descended from this  William  died in the th of  Edward  the st and left no Male Issue so that  Emelin  his only Daughter was the Heir of the Barony She married into the Family of  John  Lord  D' Arcy  and transferr'd this Manour of  Haddeston  and divers others into that Family Lord  D' Arcy  abovementioned dy'd possess'd of this Manour at  Nor∣ton  in  Lincolnshire  th  Edward  the d In the st of  Hen IV Thomas  Lord  Lumley  died pos∣sess'd of it and left it to Sir  John Lumley  his Brother This Family is so named from  Lomley  a Town situated on the Bank of the River  Were  where their Seat was They are descended from  Liulph  a Person of great Nobility in the Time of King  Edward  the Confessor who married  Algitha  the Daugh∣ter of  Aldred  Earl of  Northumberland  Sir  George Lumley  Knight he that married the Granddaughter of  Roger Thornton  of this Town was in great repute in the County of  Durham  in the Reign of  Edward  the th being High Sheriff in the d of that Reign in the th Knight of the Shire in the Year    High Sheriff again in which Office he continued three Years more  But none of this great and ancient Family was ever higher in the Esteem of his Prince none in greater Repute in his Country than is the present noble Successor  Richard  Earl of  Scarborough  who is also Viscount  Lumley  and  Waterford  Baron  Lumley  of  Lumley  Master of the Horse to his Majesty Lord Lieutenant of the Counties of  Durham  and  Northumberland  Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter one of his Majesty's most honourable PrivyCouncil  c  Haddeston Chirton  This Village is about two short Miles distant from the Town of  Newcastle  How it came out of the Hands of this Family of the  Herons  is not known But in the th of  Edward  the d it was the Lordship of  Jeffrey de Scrope  of  Masham  in  Yorkshire  After him  Ralph  Lord  Graystake  was Lord of it In the Reign of K  Henry  the th this Manour was in the Possession of  William Fitz Hugh  who dy'd and left it to his Son  Henry  It is now in the Possession of Mr  Tho Bigg  and Mrs  Jane Sanderson  who have there a House and Garden at which they reside in the Summer Season  Lit∣tleBenton Coldwell  This Place in latter Ages was the Seat of the  Wodrington  's who in the Reigns of  Henry  th  Edward  th and  Henry  th were High Sheriff's of  Northumberland  Swinburne  and  Flatford  paid for Castleward and Cor∣nage     l  s  d  For Castleward        For Cornage        THE  Hen I Simonem de Devilstone Feof  Barony of  Dilstone  containing  Dilston  a small Vil∣lage stand∣ing on the Southside of the  Tyne  call'd in old Books and ancient Records  Devilstone  from a small Brook running on the Westside of it whose Name  Bede  says was  Devilsburn  and emptying itself into  Tyne  The Barony in which it stands takes it's Name from it and is at this Day called the Barony of  Devilstone  We have not yet met with the Origi∣nal Barons of it We observe a Family in our ancient Histories bearing the Surname of  Deivill  or  Deiville  which might probably be Owners of the Manour of  Devilstone  i e the Town of  Devils  for  John Deiville  was Governour of  Scarborough  Castle in  Yorkshire  and built a Castle of his own at a certain Place called the  Hode  in that County but having no ground for this Conjecture in History we shall leave it to the Reader to accept or reject it tho' the Name being a little Unusual and looking as if its Original were derived from the Evil Spirit that bears that Name we thought fit to give some Account of it  Bede  in the same Place viz  lib c  tells us that here it was that  S Oswald  armed with the Chri∣stian Edith slew in a fair Field  Cedwell  the  Briton  a wretched Tyrant who had before slain Two Kings of  Northumberland Osrick  King of the  Deirans  and  Eanfrid  of the  Bernicians  and miserably wasted their Coun∣try But the Author of the Additions of  Cambden  contradicts Mr  Cambden  and tells us that all the Latin Copies of  Bede  that he had seen say That  Oswald  's Victory was obtain'd  in loco qui Lingua Anglorum Denisesburn vocatur i e  in the Place called by the English  Deniesburn  and the  Saxon  Copies of King  Al∣fred  's Paraphrase have  Denisses Deni ces  and  Denises burna  And the Saxon Chronicle hath not made any Mention of this Story  Sir  Francis Ratcliffe  or  Radelive  Bart descended of the ancient Family of  Ratcliff  's Earls of  Sussex  who was made a Baron of this Realm  March  did bear the Title of Baron of  Dilston  Viscount  Ratcliff  and  Langley  and Earl of  Derwentwater  in  Cumberland  He died  anno  and was buried in the Church of this Place The last Earl of this Family was  James Ratcliffe  He was beheaded on TowerHill  Anno  for being concerned in the Rebellion of that Year  Devil  or  Dilstone  Corbidge  a Town situated upon the North Bank of the River  Tine  which takes it's Name from the Bridge laid there over that River for Traffick into the Southern Parts of the County and the rest of  England  and the ancient  Roman  Name found in  Antonine  's  Itinerary  called  Corstopitum  or rather  Corstopilum  as it is read in the Edition of  H Surita  which as  Henry  of  Huntington  testifies was for Brevity Sake called  Cure  or  Cor  Here according to the Description of  Ptolomy  was the  Curia Ottodinorum  i e The Court of the  Ottodini  or  Northumbrians  The Manour of this Town  Ed  or soon after was purchased by  Henry Percy  a weal∣thy  Northumbrian  who was then in great favour with that Prince He making a Settlement of his Great Estate in the th of  Edw  the d gave two Parts of this Manour to his Son and Heir  Henry Percy  which he then was in Possession of and the third Part after the Death of  Hawise  the Widow of  John Clavering  who held it then in Dower but this  Henry  died seized of the whole Manour  Feb Edw  and left it with other great Estates to his Son and Heir of the same Name who accordingly soon after the Livery of his Lands saving to his Mother  Idonea  her reasonable Dower who had assigned her for it among other Lordships this of  Corbridge  which was not long come into his Possession but it was settled upon his Death upon his secured Wife  Joan  for her Dower How this Manour was alienated in the same Reign we cannot discover but do find  Rich  d that  Alice  the Widow of  Ralph  Lord  Nevil  of  Raby  had for her Dowry among other Manours and Rents Twenty Pounds  per ann  out of his Manour of  Corbrigge  At this Day there is nothing remarkable in this Town but the  Church  and a little  Towerhouse  fitted up and inhabited by the  Vicars  of the Place yet there are so many  Ruins of ancient Buildings  as prove it once to have been a large and spacious Town King  John  supposing that either an Earthquake or some sudden Invasion might be the Cause of so great Desolations and the Inhabitants had no Time or Way to remove their Wealth did not doubt but he might find a great Deal of Treasure upon a diligent Search but Fortune fauoured his Attempt no more than it did  Nero  's in his Enquiries after the concealed Riches of  Dido  at  Carthage  for he found nothing but Stones mark'd with Brass Iron and Lead The  Vicarage  of this Town being  all a Value as not to be a suitable Maintenance for the Minister the Dean and Chapter of  Carlisle  since the Re∣storation of King

Bank of a small Torrent which comes down from the  Wall's Side  by this Town being worn away by some impetuous Land floods the  Skeleton  of a Man appeared of a very extraordi∣nary and prodigious Size

Lordship not having Notice of it 'till it was in a great Measure squandred away and lost by the careless Discoverers he could not by all his Inquiries make it so compleat as any that have a Regard to such Curiosities could hearti∣ly wish it were But since there was not found here an intire Skeleton but Great Numbers or  Strata  of Teeth and Bones of a very extraordinary Size and withal a Sort of Pavement or Foundation of Stone running along with these  Strata  and since here hath an Altar inscribed to  Hercules  been digged up what if we should affirm that these are the Teeth and Bones of

BENWALL  Mr  Cambden  speaking of  Chester on the Street  says he supposes it to have been the  Condercum  where  upon the Line of the Wall  the first Win  of the Astures kept Garrison in the  Roman  Times as the  Notitia  tells us And this he conjestures because in the  Saxon Chestre  is called  Concester  and because it is but a few Miles from the Wall But others are of Opinion that  Benwall  a Village about two Miles West of  New∣castle  was the ancient  Condercum  because of the Antiquity of the Place and its Nearness to the Wall the  Notitia  described the  Condercum  as upon the  Line of the Wall  This indeed seems rather probable For if a Place is said to be situated  ad lineam valli  one would think it should not be far from the Wall however not in the wrong Side of  Tine  The Places of the  Roman  Garrisons  ad lineam Valli  as far as I can iudge have always been in these Counties which the  Roman  Wall past through but no Body seen yet found out the least Footsteps of it

the Manour and Estate of  Robert de Gaugi  a great Man in the Reign of King  John  and by him entrusted with the Government of divers Castles at Times to defend them against the rebellious  Barons  which he did faithfully and to his own Advantage for d  Henry III  it was certified that the Barony of this  Robert  now as we conceive called the Barony of  Caugif  for  Gaugi  in this County consisted of this and divers other Manours which he held of the King by the Service of three Knights Fees This Manour is now the Property of  Robert Lawson  Esq  of  Chirton  Crawlington  Heaton  is a small Village distant from  Newcastle  about a Mile and a Half Eastward It has been handed down by Tradition to the present Day that it was a Place of Retreat for King  John  when he came into this Country and there are still to be seen the Ruines of an  ancient Building  now in the possession of  Richard Ridley  Esq  which carries the Name of  King  John  's Palace  Whatever Truth there may be in this Tradition this is certain that there is in the said  Gentleman  's Ground on the  Northside  of this old Building the Remains of a Fortification which 'tis natural to conjecture was built for the Safety and Security of this House and con∣sequently this House must have been of some great Distinction And when it is further considered that this Village of  Heaton  is a Part of the  Barony of  Robert de  Gaugy  it may not be improbable to conclude that this ancient Building has in some Measure been what Tradition says it was For  Robert de Gaugy  was a great Man in the Reign of King  John  and was entrusted by him as has just now been observed with the Government of divers Castles at Times to defend them against the  rebellious Barons  which he did faithfully and to his own Advantage for in the d of  Henry III  it was certified that the Barony of this  Robert  in this Coun∣ty consisted of this and the other Manours which he held of the King by the Service of  Three Knights Fees  This  Robert  therefore might have had his own House here upon this Part of his Barony and as he was so faithful a servant to King  John  and entrusted by him with Matters of such great Concern it is not impro∣bable but when the King came to these Parts he lodged at this House and this perhaps was the Reason of its getting the Name it hears at this Day  This is its ancient Grandeur its present is the House and Family of the worthy Gentleman above mentioned it was built in the Year    it is a beautiful House and so situated that on the  West  it overlooks the  TownMoor Fenham  and Part of the Lands of the Prior of  Tinmouth  on the  East  it faces the  Sheilds Road  on the  North  it has a most agreeable Prospect to the Windings of the  OuseBurn  of its Woods and Banks and of the Villages situated on it On the South it faces the River  Tine  Its Conveniencies and Beauties a∣bout it are on the Westside a  FishPond Groves Wilderness Gardens Avenues  and Numbers of Plan∣tations On the  East  a very large and beauteous Quadrangle whose Walls are shaded with the choicest FruitTrees and whose  Area  is adorn'd with Variety of  Knots  and  Flowers  In this  Area  at a due Distance are two  Images  tall as the Life which declare the Hand of a curious  Statuary  On the  North  are Gardens and Plantations and on the  South  an  Area  Adorned with Images and a pleasing GravelWalk beset

Family of the  Ridleys  where is still to be seen above one of the old Doors the Date of the Year of its Building which was earlier than the Conquest and the initial Letters of the Name of the Builder  N R  This  Nicholas  was of the younger Branch of the  Ridleys  of  WilmotesWike  the Seat as Mr  Cambden  says of the  worshipful Family of the Ridleys  which is a pretty large  Castle  on the Southside of  Tine  and very ancient as appears from several Things about it  A little above this upon the Banks of the  Tine  is the Estate of Mr  Nicholas Ridley  the younger Son of the said Gentleman  This  Nicholas  Senior was  twice Mayor of  Newcastle in the Year    and in the Year    and was esteemed a Man of great Honour and Integrity and an excellent Magistrare By his last Will and Testament dated th  December  he gave and bequeathed to the Poor of the Parish of  Haltwhistle  s  per annum  out of a little Farm or Tenement called  Waggtail  Hall He also gave a RentCharge of  l

Charles I  Besides the Gentlemen of this Family already mentioned we shall only take Notice of the two Persons following  Nicholas Ridley  first Bishop of  Rochester  and then Bishop of  London  He

Service of two Knights Fees as his Father and Predecessors had done This Barony had many Towns and wordships belonging to it  This  Robert  being constituted Chief Justice of the King's Forests in  Derby Cumberland  this County  c  had free Warren granted him in all his Demesne Lands here and divers others of his Manours in this County  Hen III  But th  Hen III  he delivered up this Castle into the King's Hands who being advancing with an Ar∣my against the  Scots  did not think it safe to suffer so strong a Fort out of his own Power but upon the King's Return it was yielded up to him again the next year Afterwards the King began a Suit against him for the Title of his Castle of  Werke  but he in his Defence producing his elder Brother  William  for Warranty the King upon mature Advice with such Noblemen as were of his Council discerning that he had a good Right to it quitted his Claim to him This  Robert  not long after this fell in Love with a  Scotch  Woman and having a Mind to get her for his Wife not only joined himself with the  Scots  but endeavoured to engage his Kinsman on their Side viz  William de Ros  of  Hemlake  who detesting such Treachery dissuaded him from it

upon an Allegation that he had before his Death come to an Accord with  John Comin  of  Badenagh  for himself and all his Arms with him to be safe as to Life Liberty and Estate How she married we find

Bywell  the Baron of  Bothal  and  Lastly  the Baron of  Delaval  should build each of them a House within the Liberties of the Castle for the Defence of it The House of the Baron of  Werk  was built over the  Postern  THERE were two great strong Walls which surrounded the Castle The interior Wall was of no great Distance from the Castle itself as may be still seen in several Places The exterior Wall surrounds the Verge of the  Castle  Bounders From this  outer Wall  were four Gates the  Great Gate  and three Posterns The Northside of the  Castle  is the  main Gate  called now the  Black Gate  It has had two PortCullicesses one without the Gate as may be still seen and another within it at a little Distance from it the Ruins of which were to be seen a few Years ago There still remains a Piece of the old Wall which shews its Situation to have been where that House is which was lately purchased by Mr  Jasper Harrison  the Shop belonging to this House was dugg as I was informed out of the Wall just now mentioned On the Eastside of the  Castle  there was a  Postern  which led down to the Street called the  Side  which is still to be seen it was once called but ma∣ny Years after it was in Decay the  Waist of  Laurentius Acton On the Southside of the  Castle  is another Gate which leads down the  Castlestairs  to the Street called the  Close  This was called the  South Postern  There is an old Building upon it which was the CountyGoaler's House On the West∣side was the Postern facing  Bailiff  Gate now the Dwellinghouse of  James Lidster  THERE is an House in the Yard where

CastleGarth  as in other Parts of the Town of  Newcastle  AN Inquisition in the Reign of  James  I says that the ancient  Castle  be∣longing to the King situated within the Walls of  Newcastle  upon  Tine  be∣longs to the County of  Northumberland  and is surrounded with a great StoneWall That below the Castle there is a great  Hall  where the County of  Northumberland  holds their Assizes There is also a great  Tower  full of Chinks under which are two Vaults which are the Places where the Pri∣soners of the County of  Northumberland  are kept which are within the Circuit of the Castle itself  AND that there is in Being the exterior Wall of the Castle which begins North of the Castle about six Yards from the  Great Gate  which leads into the  Castleyard  and so goes on eastward and southward by the Back of some Houses in the  Side  Then it goes westward by the Back of some Houses in the  Sandhill  then it crosses the  Castlestairs  which lead to the Street called the  Close  and from thence behind the Houses even to the upper  PinionGa∣vel  of the House of  James Clavering  Alderman which is about nine Yards distant from the long Stairs where the said ancient Wall on account of its Decay does no farther appear but yet the Bounds and Limits of the Castle go through the middle Part of a House extending itself even to the Channel in the long Stairs Then it goes along the Channel upwards on the Outside of the new Wall which was built to enclose the  The high and great Heap  viz  the Dunghill on the West∣side of the Castle was taken away by Sir  John Marley  Mayor and his Adhe∣rents to ram∣part the TownWalls against the Parliament and Com∣monwealth  Dunghill From thence it goes to the Corner of the House of  and thence by the Backpart of the House of  where the ancient outward Wall begins This ancient outward Wall of the Castle contains by Measure three Acres of Ground and one Rood  IN the th of this King's Reign another Inquisition was held at  New∣castle  about the Castle wherein Complaint was made of the  Dunghill  men∣tioned in the Bounds of the Castle that it had increased to such a Bigness that it was in Length Yards the Depth of it was Yards and the Breadth of it Yards which being such a prodigious Weight upon the Wall on the Westside of the Castle which Wall was in Length Yards in Height Yards in Breadth Yards that a great Part of it is intirely thrown down and subverted to the great Detriment of the Strength of the Castle The Damage was computed at  l  IT was also by this same Inquisition complained of that the great square Tower was full of Chinks and Crannies and that one Third of it was almost taken away That all the Lead and Covering which it had of old was im∣bezled and carried of insomuch that the Prisoners of the County of  Northum∣berland  were most miserably lodged by reason of the Showers of Rain falling upon them They computed the Charge of repairing it would be  l    s    d  IT has been a Building of great Strength and no little Beauty the vast Thickness of the Walls speaks the one and the Ruines of some curious Workmanship speaks the other The grand Entrance into the Castle was at the Gate facing the South which leads up a Pair of Stairs which still shew the Magnificence of the Builder to a very stately Door of curious Masonry The Room this leads into has its Floor broken down close to the CastleWall as indeed all the other Floors are to the Top of the Castle so that ex∣cepting the Floor above the CountyGoal there is not one left tho' there have been five Divisions or Stories of the Castle besides this This floored Room which I was told was lately flagg'd by the Order of  William Ellison  Esq  Alderman when he was last Mayor in the Year seems to me without any Doubt to have been the  common Hall  of the Castle because on the Northside of the same Room there is an Entrance by a Descent of some Steps into a Room where is the largest Fireplace I saw in the Castle which plainly speaks it to have been the Kitchen At the End of this there are se∣veral  Stairs which lead into a Place under the Kitchen which I think goes down as low as the Bottom of the Castle This I take to have been a Cel∣lar as I do also that little  dark Place  on the right Hand coming up again to have been a Sort of a Pauntry  THE Door I mentioned just now on the East of the Castle which leads to the first broken down Floor is because of it's Grandeur and Beauty an Argument that this Room has been the most stately one in the whole Castle another Reason for it's being so is because of the Windows which gave Light into it Those of them that face the East are the most beautiful of the whole Castle besides on the South of this Room there is an Entrance into a Sort of a Parlour or withdrawingRoom which has a Fire Place in it which has been a Piece of curious Workmanship as is visible to this Day and this Place has no Communication with any Part of the Castle but this Room On the Northside of this Room is a Door leading into an Apartment where stands a Well of a considerable Depth it was Yards before we touch'd the Surface of the Water which seems to have been placed there on purpose for the more immediate Service of  this Room  There are some little Basons on the Top of the  Well  with Pipes leading from them which conveyed Water to different Appartments of the Castle This is plain from what may be obser∣ved in the  County Goal  at the Bottom of the Castle the round stone Pillar in it having an Hollow in the Middle of a Foot wide with a lead Spout in the Side of it  IN the Inquisition made in the th of  Edward  d abovementioned among other Things that were complained of for being neglected one was  Capella Do∣mini Regis infra Castrum  This Chapel I have been told stood on that Part of the Castle Yard where the Moothall is but upon Searching I found it in the Castle itself according to the Account of it just now mentioned The Door of it is at the Bottom of the South Wall of the Castle adjoining to the Stairs which lead into the State Chamber It has been a Work of great Beau∣ty and Ornament and is still in the midst of Dust and Darkness by far the most beautiful Place in the whole Building the Inside of it being curiously adorned with Arches and Pillars It is easy to observe the different Parts of it the  Entrance  the  Body of it  and the  Chancel  on the left Side of the En∣trance you go into a dark little Room which undoubtedly was the Vestry The full Length of it is Yards the Breadth of it is Yards and half It had or Windows towards the East which are now all filled up nor is there any Light but what comes in at a little Cranny in the Wall  Nicholas de Byker  Tenet terras suas ut faciat districtiones ad Ward' Novi Ca∣stelli super Tynam faciend' pro deb' Domini Regis inter Tynam Cocket c  And then my Authority goes on to say that the Manour of  Byker  was Sir  Ralph Lawson  's Knight deceased after of  Henry Lawson  Esq  his Son and now of his eldest Son who without all Question is Bailiff by Inheritance of the said Castle and is to levy these Castleward Cornage and other Rents Issues Fines and Amerciaments belonging to the said Castle And as he goes on the Constable of the Castle when that Office is settled may ap∣point the learned Stewards to keep Courts and then the Officers for the said Castle will be compleat Besides the Rents abovementioned a great Num∣ber of Houses Yards and Gardens paid to it  IN the th of  James  I a Grant was made of the Scite and De∣mesnes of the Castle to  Alexander Stephenson  Esq  who was succeeded by one  Patrick Black  who died and left it in the Possession of his Wife After that one  James Langton  Gent claimed  Patrick Black  's Right but by Virtue of what is not known  THE Liberties and Privileges of the Castle extends Northwards to the Ri∣ver of  Tweed  and Southward to the River of  Tees  IT is reported that underneath that House which was anciently the Coun∣ty Goal is a  Vault  which leads to the Castle There is indeed a large Door still to be seen which perhaps was the Entrance into it and Mr  George Grey  the present Possessor of the House told me that it was certainly so be∣cause he had put down thro' his own Floor a Bailiff's Rod to the very End and could find no Bottom  A Manuscript I have often had Occasion to mention gives us the following Account of the CastleYard  THE Way thro' the Yard begins at the  CastleYate  and when I was young there was no Houses in it but the House of one  Thomas Southern  and the House of one  Green  these Houses were near the Gate before you came into the Ca∣stleyard and there was in the Garth a House wherein the  Goaler  of the Ca∣stle dwelt and a House wherein  William Robinson  dwelt who was Deputy Herrald under  Norroy King at Arms  This Man wrote in a Book the Arms of all the Mayors of this Town from  Laurentius Acton  until his Time And when I was Chamberlain of the Town which was about the Time of Sir  Nicholas Cole  's being Mayor in the Year it was then in the Town's Chamber when  Trollop  built the  TownCourt  he borrow'd it but would ne∣ver restore it  THESE were all the Houses at that Time but since then Mr  Bulmer  he took a Garth behind his House in the  Side  and built a Stable in it and had a Garden in it and also  George Hayroy  took from thence to the  Moathall  and built Houses upon it He was a Butcher but not a Freeman and these took their Lands and Houses of  Alexander Stephenson  a Scottish Man who came in with King  James  for he begg'd the Castle of the King He was one of his CloseStool This Man began to build the CastleGate but it was finished by one  John Pickle  who made it in the Fashion it is now and kept a Tavern in it and then one  Jordan  a Scotsman and  SwordKipper  built the House on the Southside of the Gate and lived in it and  Thomas Reed  a Scotch Pedlar took a Shop in the Northside of the Gate  AT present there are a good many Shops and Houses belonging to it in and about it  CHAP X  Of the lower Parts of the  TOWN  HAVING now considered the  Castle  and what belongs to it we return back to the  Side  the Street from which we entred the  Castleyard  Sect I  The  SIDE  T  HIS Street is from the Head of it to the  Stairs  on the left Hand a very great descent and lies narrow untill you come to the middle of it from which Place it opens in a spacious Breadth and so continues to the  Sandhill  It is from the one end to the other fill'd with Shops of  Merchants Goldsmiths Milliners Uphol∣sters  c The Eastside of this Street from the Upper Part of it to  Allhallow Pant  was called  Cordiner  or  Cordwainer Rawe  ABOVE the middle of the Street are Stairs leading up to the Castleyard which was the EasternPostern of the Castle and after called the Waste of  Laurentius Acton  as appears from the Account of  Gunner Tower  and our Townsman  Grey  says that in the Middle of this Street is an antient  StoneHouse  an Appendix to the Castle which in former Times belonged to the Lord  Lumley  before the Castle was built or at least coetany with the Castle  ON the other Side of this Street opposite to the Waste now mentioned is a  Corner Shop  which formerly belong'd to a Chantery in St  John  's Church On the same Side of this Street almost opposite to this EasternPostern of the Castle is a short narrow Lane which formerly seems to have gone by the Name of  Vide Gun∣nerTower  Swinburnplace  which leads by Stairs into a dark narrow Lane which faces the  Painter Heugh  that leads into  Pilgrimstreet  On the North∣end of this Lane there was a Place called  Vide Gun∣nerTower  Pencher Place  perhaps the whole Lane was called so It goes as far as the  Netherdeanbridge  under which is now a Warehouse of Mr  James Moncaster  Merchant Under this I am  told the  Rings  are still to be seen that the  Boats  were fastned to which brought up the Merchant Goods when the Merchants had their Shops in the  Fleshmarket  On the South it leads to the Side  THE Pant standing near the Shop of Mr  Robert Makepeice  is undoubted∣ly that which went by the Name of  AllHallowPant  The other Side of the Street from  AllHallowPant  to the  CaleCross  was formerly divided by the coming up of the River which was called  Lorkburn  and the East of it had the Name of  FlesherRaw  because I suppose the Butchers had their Shops there as well as on the  ButcherBank  The West bore the Name of the  Side  Af∣ter that  Lorkburn  was cover'd with Flags at the Top and made one Street which all goes by the Name of the Side In the Year  Lorkburn  was arch'd at the Top and pav'd over  WE come now to the  CaleCross  so called because of the  Cale  or  Broth  which was sold there in former Times This seems to have been it's original Name for I meet with it in the Reign of King  Richard  the Second as may be seen in the Account of  St Margaret  's Chantery in  St Nicholas  and also in a Writing dated  Edward  the Third What  Grey  says of it is still just that it is a fair Cross with Columns of Stone Hewn covered with Lead There is at the Top of it a Cistern which holds the  NewWater  Here is sold Milk Eggs Cheese Butter  c  FROM the  Cross  the Street has the Name of  CaleCross  'till you come to the  Sandhill  which leaving the  ButcherBank  that leads to  AllHallow  's Church on the left Hand you come immediately to  Sect II SANDHILL  THE  Sandhill  is so called because it was formerly a  Hill  of  naked Sand  when the Tide was out For formerly the  Tyne  overflowed all this Place After it was taken in it became Part of the Town That Part of it on the Westside of  Lorkburn  was a Place of Pleasure and Recreation for the TownsPeople For in the Reign of  Richard  the d a Proclamation was made com∣manding to remove all Merchandise from a certain  Common Place  in  Newcastle  called  Sandhill  where the Inhabitants were wont to assemble for their Recrea∣tion  IT is a spacious Place and adorned with Buildings very high and state∣ly whose Rooms speak the  Ancient Grandeur  being very large and Magni∣ficent It is now that Part of the Town where the chief Affairs of Trade and Business are transacted The Shops in this Street are almost altogether those of  Merchants  which have many of them great Conveniencies of Lofts Garners and Cellars  HERE is the Market for  Fish Herbs Bread Cloth Leather  c which for the one Part of Things  viz  those to be wore is kept every  Tuesday  and  Saturday  for Things to be eat every Day  ON the Southside of the Street is the ancient Hospital

Wife  c  This Priest was called the  Guardian  or  Keeper  of the said Hospital because of the Care he had over  nine poor Men  and  four poor Women  who resided there These poor People were called

their Friends for at that Time Houses were not large 'Tis true indeed the Houses in the  Fleshmarket  which were built many Years before this up∣on  the  Sandhill  had most of them Rooms near as stately if not altogether as stately as this Room is but then they were the Houses of the  Great Mer∣chants and Aldermen of the Town  So that the Tradition of this Room may be true enough  THIS Hall is adorn'd with the Arms of several  generous Benefactors  and some of the most curious carv'd Work in Wood Here it is that for some Years by past the annual Feast of the Sons of the Clergy has been

and more for finishing them and making the  Conduit  on the  Sandhill  THIS Building as to its Form and Model is of great Beauty and withal very sumptuous That Part of it which is the  Court  itself is a very stately  Hall  whose lofty Cicling is adorn'd with various Painting and its Floor laid with checker'd Marble On the  East end  of it is a Dial and the Entrance into the  Merchants Court  On the West are the  Benches  where the Magi∣strates sit raised considerably above the Floor of the  Court  above which are the Pictures of King  Charles  II and King  James  II large as the Life On the North a Gallery for Spectators and on the South the Windows which are very pretty particularly that Window which is a  KatharineWheel  in which is a large Sundial of painted Glass with this Motto  Eheu Fugaces  Under this is a large  Balcony  which overlooks the River Here it is that the  Mayor  and  Sheriff  keep their Courts and the Judges at  Lammas  hold the Assize Here is kept the  Guilds  the Court of  Admiralty  c  ON the Northside of this  Hall  is a magnificent Entrance into a Passage which leads into a large Room called the  Town's Chamber  Here it is that the  Mayor  transacts the common Business of the Town Here the Common Council is held where the  Mayor  sits on a Bench distinguishable from the others the Aldermen on each Side of him the Common Council below upon Chairs placed on each Side the Room and separated from the Benches as the Court itself is separated from the Benches there And here upon the Days of  Rejoicing  the  State Holidays  the Mayor not long ago entertained the  Ma∣gistrates  and  Burgesses  with a Banquet of Wine  c  to which they were wont to come from the  Mayor  's  House  with great Pomp and Solemnity At the Westend of the Room is a small Apartment or withdrawing Room where the Magistrates upon Occasion retire where the ancient Records of the Town are kept  c  Under this Court and Chambers are the  Weighhouse  and  Townhouse  The former is for weighing all Sorts of Commodities for in the Reign of King  Henry  VI Brass Weights according to the Stand∣art were sent to this Town The latter is the Place where the Clerk of the Chamber and the Chamberlain are to receive the Revenues of the Town for  Coal Salt Ballast GrindStone  c  Grey  BEFORE I leave this Street I must by no Means omit the Effigies of King  James  II which stood here as I have been told on that Side of the Bullring next the Courtstairs By the Account I have had for I never saw the Statue itself nor the Picture of it it must have been a very curious Work The King's Picture on Horseback was cast in  Copper  large as the Life the Horse stood upon his HindFeet raised upon a Pedestal of  white Marble  which was surrounded with  IronPales  It cost the Town  l  and was confess'd the most beautiful and curious of its Kind that was in the whole Kingdom Certainly it was a great Ornament to the Town and 'tis therefore great Pity it is not still in Being tho' it was the Statue of an un∣fortunate King But there is no Bounds to the heady Proceedings of a fu∣rious Mob it drives all before it without either Reason or Reflection and bears no Regard to Things either Civil or religious Such a one I am told was this that pull'd down the  noble Statue  a few Soldiers as drunk with Loyalty as with Liquor assisted by the busy hotheaded Genius of  Sandgate  having provided Ropes for that Purpose pull'd it down dragg'd it from thence to the  Key  and threw it into the  River  This was in the Year it was afterwards taken up again and Part of it cast into a Set of Bells which now belong to  AllHallows  in this Town  Sect III  The  CLOSE  ON the East of this Street is the Entrance to the  Keyside  which shall be spoken hereafter On the  West  is the  Close  to which as you go along you pass by the  Northside of the Chapel of St  Thomas  the Martyr  and on the other Side opposite to this  Chapel  an ancient House which is said to be built by  Richard de Emmeldon  Mayor of  Newcastle  for three Priests to pray for his Soul I take it to be nigh those Stairs which lead up to the  HalfMoon  the ancient outward Fortification  FROM hence going on still Westward you cross over the Northend of the  Tinebridge  and so pass into the Street called the  Closs  It answers its Name exactly well for it is but narrow and close too It was formerly that Part of the Town where the principal Inhabitants liv'd Sir  John Marly  Sir  William Blacket  Sir  Mark Milbank  and the Houses of many other Gentle∣men of Figure are still remembred by the ancient Inhabitants And indeed however the Street itself may be however mean the Fronts of the Houses are within they speak Magnificence and Grandeur the Rooms being very large and stately and for the most Part adorn'd with curious  Carving  The Earl of  Northumberland  's House was in this Street it was that House which has at its Entrance a  great Gate  besides which there is a large round Ball of Stone the House on this Side Mr  Thorp Stewart  's In the lower Part of this Building towards the Water are very manifest Tokens of its Antiquity  OF late Years these Houses have been forsaken and their wealthier Inha∣bitants have chosen the higher Parts of the Town  ON the right Hand as you enter the Street from the  TineBridge  are Stairs which lead into the  Castleyard  which were the  Southern Postern  of the Castle and are called the  Castlestairs  On the same Side a little further along are  other Stairs  which are called the  Long Stairs  which lead up to the  BailiffGate Backraw Castleyard Side  c almost opposite to which is a small  Key  called  JavelGripp  Somewhat further along are  other Stairs  on the same Side of the Street leading to  Westgate  which are called  TudhillStairs  Perhaps it is not amiss to tell you what I have been somewhere inform'd of that the pro∣per Name of it should be  Touthill  from the touting or winding of a Horn upon it when an Enemy was at Hand What makes me the more incline∣able to believe this Tradition to be true is that Cornage was paid to the Castle as may be seen in our Account of it Now  Cornage  comes from the Word  Cornagium  from  Cornu  a Horn and was a Kind of grand Serjeanty The Service of which Tenure was to blow a Horn when any Invasion of the  Scots  was perceived and by this many Men held their Land Northward a∣bout the  Picts Wall Cambd Britan  Pag and  Littleton  Fol  ALMOST opposite to these Stairs is the House of the Mayors of  New∣castle  where they reside during the Year of their Mayoralty It is a Build∣ing grand and stately and considering the Place it stands in is very orna∣mental As the Mayors of  Newcastle  have such continual Business at Court tho' the Situation is not so pleasing as that of the upper Part of the Town it is yet more advantageous as it is nigher the Court  BEYOND this House a little Way still going on Westward is the Gate belonging to this Street called the  CloseGate  The Townwall descends from the  WestFriar Tower  down a dangerous Pair of Stairs upon a very steep Bank to this Gate from which it goes Southward to the Waterside where is an old Tower now the Hall of the Sailmakers  WITHOUT this  Close  Gate is a Way to the  Forth  a Place of Recreation  IN the  Close  were many Houses which pay an annual Rent to the Master and Brethren of St  Mary  the Virgin  THIS Street is commemorated in many ancient Writings for a Mill which in ancient Times long before these were drawn was wont to stand upon the  Hoga  that is upon the  Bank  without the  CloseGate  In a Grant from the Master and Brethren of St  Mary  's in  Westgate  it is permitted to the Parties concern'd that they have  quandam placeam terrae in Vico quoe voca∣tur  le Closs  sicut se extendit in longitudine de Hoga ubi  antiquum molidinum  solebat stare usque ad aquam  Tinae  quantum de  Tina  acquirere poterit  Sect IV TINEBridge  IN coming into the  Close  we cross'd the End of the  The Bridge is of great Antiquity undoubtedly as old as the Times of the  Romans  There must have been a Communication between this and the other Side of the River and therefore there was a Necessity for it The ingenious Mr  Horsley  p    says  I think there are some certain and visible Remains of a military Way on  Gateshead  Fell pointing directly towards the Part where I suppose the Station has been at  Newcastle  and coming as I apprehend from  Chester le Street  Dr  Hunter  as∣sured me he had also observ'd visible Remains of such a Way And it is the common Opinion that there has been a military Way from  Chester  to  Newcastle  this Way tends towards the Place where the Bridge now is There must then have been a Bridge in the  Roman  Times over the River  Tine  near the Place where the present Bridge stands  Tine  Bridge let us now return and consider it a little It has been a Query whether the Bridge was originally of Wood or Stone but I think it is altogether need∣less all the Bridges in  England  were originally of Wood In the Reign of  Richard  I  Philip  Bishop of  Durham  sent to the Burgesses of  GateSide  a Grant of  Forestage  in which are these Words  And it shall be lawful for every Bur∣gess to give Wood to whomsoever he will to be spent about the River of  Tine  without any Licence  This I imagine has been for the building of Keys and especially for the repairing of the  Bishop  's Part of the Bridge which is a fur∣ther Proof that this Bridge which was the original one was  Wood  But what I think puts it beyond Dispute is that according to  Matthew Paris  it was burnt in the Year together with a great Part of the Town  AFTER this Misfortune hapned the Town who repairs two Thirds of the Bridge and the  Thomas Ruthall  Bi∣shop of  Dur∣ham  in the Reign of  Henry VII  built or re∣pair'd the third Part of the Bridge o∣ver the River  Tine  to∣ward the South  Good∣win  Bishop the other laid out their Endeavours to raise up another Bridge of  Stone  Accordingly the Bishop of  Durham  sent out Indul∣gences and the Town procured other Bishops to do the same to all those that would assist either with Money or Labour in the erecting of it By which Means they got such a Sum as was sufficient  THE Archdeacon of  Northumberland  wrote to the Clergy of his Archdea∣conry and desired them to assist the Work of the  Bridge  as much as they could telling them their venerable Father the Lord Bishop of  Durham  by his Letters Patents had commanded them without any Let or Delay to go about the Affair of  Indulgences  and that they were to prefer the Episcopal Indulgences to others And what arose from them was to be given to the  Master of the Bridge  who was then  Laurentius  for the Use of the Bridge  Lib Cart  IN like Manner the Official of  Carlisle  promised an Indulgence of Days to any one that would assist the repairing of  Tine  Bridge  WALTER  Bishop of  Rochester  on the th of the Ides of  September  in the Year of our Lord granted an  Indulgence of    Days  to all that bestowed Part of the Substance GOD had given them to the repairing of the  Tine  Bridge or would assist the repairing of it by working at it with their own Hands  IT is supposed by some that  William  St  Barbara  sent the following Indul∣gence but that can't be for he liv'd a great while before the Bridge was built It was therefore  Walter  Bishop of  Durham  who in the th Year of his Pontificate sent it dated at  Weremouth  Walte∣rus Dei gra∣tia Dunelm Epis dilectis in Christo Filiis Archi∣diacon Of∣ficialibus Decan

Because he that sowes in Peace shall reap in Peace and he that  soweth in Blessings shall of Blessings also reap and shall reap eternal Life Seeing then that the  Tine  Bridge wants Abundance of Repairs and cannot be sustained without large Alms we command to admonish those that are under you and efficaciously bring them to give Alms of the Things which GOD hath bestowed on them and that for the Sake of Charity they would bestow on the Work what they can that by their own Aid and Assistance a Work of this Kind may be restored And relying on the Mercy of the Omnipotent God and on the Merits and Intercession of the blessed Apostles  Peter  and  Paul  we release all those our Parishioners truly repenting and confessing who shall piously contribute of the Things GOD hath sent them to

Grant to col∣lect Alms throughout his whole Diocess for the repairing of the  Tyne  Bridge  THE Bishop of  Waterford  in  Ireland  granted also to those that would assist the repairing of the  Tyne

him Who the Founder of it was I have never been able to learn nor the Time of it's Building but it must have been after the Year the Year when the  Martyr  suffer'd and it must have been built before

th of  September  the whole Body of the Magistrates coming to it with the usual Solemnities and Formalities was set apart by the Corporation for a Chapel of Ease to the Church of St  Nicholas  The Sermon in the Morning was preached by the Rev Mr Vicar that in the Afternoon by the Rev Mr  Clayton  The officiating Ministers are the Rev Mr  Cowling  who preaches on the Sunday Morning and the Rev Mr  Cuthberts  and the Rev Mr  Clay∣ton  on the Sunday Afternoon alternately  A little beyond this is a large and strong Building which  Grey  informs us was built a little before the Writing of his History upon an Arch of the Bridge and used for a  Magazine  for the Town Under this are the Shops of  Francis Rudston  Esq  Alderman and Mr  William Sorsby  There is very visible above this Gateway the Remains of a Port Cullice After the  Restoration  the Picture of King  Charles  the d was set up on the South side of this Buil∣ding with this Motto under it  Adventus Regis Solamen Gregis The coming of the King is the Comfort of the People  It was wont to look exceedingly beautiful and in coming along the Bridge from the South was a very wor∣thy and conspicuous Ornament to the Town but of late it is pretty much obscur'd with Dust if not defac'd with the Weather through the Want of being put into a little Order and Regularity  ON the Northside of this Building is an Account of it's being repair'd in the Year  Henry Reay  Esq  Mayor  Joseph Green  Esq  Sheriff  AFTER you come from under the Gateway of the  Magazine  there is an  open  on the Bridge on either Side Over the one of these it was that surpri∣zing Accident happened to Mr  Anderson  a Merchant and Alderman this  Town As he was looking over the Bridge talking with a Friend he finger'd a Ring he had on as People frequently do when they are thoughtful which before he was aware fell into the River and was given entirely over for lost Sometime after one of his Servants having bought a Salmon in the Market found the very Ring in the Belly of the Fish and restored it to his Master  Herodotus  gives the like Account in the d Book of  Polycrates  King of  Samos  who was at that Time esteem'd one of the Favourites of Fortune which as my Authority observes may satisfy us of the Truth of  Solomon  's saying  There is no new Thing under the Sun  THIS Gentleman was Mayor of  Newcastle  and was Ancestor of the present Mr  Abraham Anderson  Merchant on the  Sandhill  The said  Fran∣cis Anderson  made his Estate to his Son  Henry Anderson  who was the Father of the said  Abraham  's Grandfather The Estate and Ring have been in the Family ever since and are now in the Possession of the said  Abraham  I my self saw this  Ring  about Months ago The Impression the Seal gives is that of  Soloman  and the Queen of  Sheba  On the Inside of the Ring just under the Signet is the Picture of a  Salmon  in Commemoration of the Fish and the Transaction on the one Side of which is the Letter  F  and on the other the Letter  R  in Commemoration of the  Person  It is a Curiosity so great that not only the whole Kingdom can't show the like of it but the whole World beside nay the World itself never that we know of had the like Transaction but once before  viz  that beforementioned The Gentleman therefore who has this valuable Jewel in his Possession ought to have the ut∣most Care of it upon many Accounts and as none of the least that it is a Credit to his Family as well as to the Town  A little further about the middle of the Bridge is a large old Tower which they call the Tower of the Bridge where leud and disorderly Persons are kept 'till they are examined by the Mayor and brought to due Punishment ex∣cept the Crime be of a very gross Nature and then are removed to  Newgate  and there continue 'till the Assizes Beyond this a little is the  BlueStone  which gives the Name of the  BlueStone  to that Part of the Bridge Here is the Bounds of  Newcastle  Southwards Beyond this the other Part of the Bridge belongs to the County Palatine of  Durham  and is repaired by the  Bishop  At the End of the Bridge which leads into  Gateside  is another  Tower  where has been a  Drawbridge  Sect V  Of the  KEYSIDE  ABOVE when I mentioned the  Sandhill  I took Notice that on the East it leads to the  Keyside  which is a long  Wharf  or  Key  for Ships and other Vessels It is built upon the  Sand  as indeed all the lower Parts of the Town have been Through this Street goes the remaining Part of the  Townwall  which is continued from the Eastend of the  Merchants Court  to  Sand∣gate Gate  which make in some Manner  two Streets  the Inside and Outside of the  Key  On the Top of this  Wall  is a  Walk  along it as is along the  other Walls  of the  Town  and at the Bottom of it are a great many  Gates  which are called  Watergates  These in the Reign of King  James  I  Anno  were ordered to be locked up every Night except one or two to stand open for the Masters and Seamen to go to and fro to their Ships This was done to prevent Servants casting Ashes and other Rubbish into the River and those two Gates were watched all Night long  THIS Key extends in Length from East to West Rods  THIS Street is chiefly inhabited by such as have their Living by Shipping such as Merchants  Hostmen Brewars  c As it is the great Place of Re∣sort for the Business of the  Coaltrade  the grand Support of this Town and Country and many other Places also and likewise for many other Things it is not much to be wondred at if in going along it you see almost no∣thing but a whole Street of Signposts of Taverns Alehouses Coffeehouses  c  AFTER you pass the  Customhouse  where the King's Customs are received which is at the  Westend  of this Street as you go along eastward you meet with a great many narrow  Chairs  or  Lanes  These have so many Times changed their Names and in all Probability will so often do it that it is to little Purpose at present to mention them There is however  GrundonChair  which I meet with in a Writing of several hundred Years old as also the Name of the  Broad Chair  of a very ancient Standing and the Name of ano∣ther in a Writing drawn in the Reign of  Henry  VI which had it been worth remembring would in all Probability have been forgot long before now But which of the others went formerly by the Names of  BrownChair  the Chair of  Nicholas de Salicibus Tod's Chair Norham Chair Philip's Chair Shipman Chair Oliver Chair Galway Chair  we are altogether in the dark There is one more ancient Name of a  Chair  in this Street which is the  KirkChair  or the Way or Lane they generally went to Church by from the  Key∣side  This I take to be that Chair which now goes by the Name of  Fen∣wick  's Entry because its Situation answers so exactly to the  Churchyard  the Top of this Chair being almost upon a Line with the Stairs that lead up to the Church This Lane is much the neatest of the whole Street having in it several  good Houses  which are kept in a different Order from the Generality of the House in those narrow Lanes In the upper Part of it is the Dwel∣linghouse of  Cuthbert Fenwick  Esq  Alderman of this Town who is the Proprietor of the whole Entry  AT the  Key  itself is a very safe Station for Ships where they lye free and secure from the greatest Dangers of Wind and Water where they unload their Wares and Commodities their  Wood Deal  and by a  Crane  their  Wines Flax  and all heavier Commodities  CHAP XI  Of  Pandon  or  Pampedon  H  AVING done with what was anciently called  Newcastle  we come now to describe the ancient Town of  Pampedon  which was a Town of itself distinct from  Newcastle  but was united to it in the Reign of  Edward  I  Vide anno  There is some Doubt about the Reason of the Name some imagining it came from  Pandana  one of the Gates of  Rome  which was so called  quia semper paterit  because  it stood always open  But I dare say this could ne∣ver give Name to the Town of  Pandon  which being in all Probability a  Roman  Place of Defence was rather obliged to be always shut Others imagine it came from  Pandara  a  Scottish Virgin Saint  but for what Reason they know best For my Part I never saw one yet and perhaps for good Reason For if I mistake not this Town had the Name of  Pandon  before there ever was  a Saint in that Kingdom  I am therefore in∣clinable to believe that it got its Name from the  Romans  who lived in it who as  Grey  agrees called it  Pampedon  or  Pantheon  because perhaps some Building was erected here in this Place in Imitation of the  Pantheon  at  Rome  this Wall being the utmost Confines of the  Roman  Empire which was built in Honour of all the Gods And as this Wall was the utmost Bounds of the  Roman Empire  therefore there might be such a  Temple  in this Place to remind the  Romans  of the necessary Assistance of all the Gods to preserve the Bounds of the  Roman Empire  The late  Rom Brit  p    Mr  Horsley  will have the latter Syllable of this Word to come from the Word  Deen  which signifies a  Hollow  or a  Brook  because such is the Place But with this I cannot agree the  Deen  could not have that Weight with it as to give Name to the whole Place or should that be allowed how is the former Part of the Name accounted for It retains therefore as  Grey  justly observes its Name without much Alteration since the  Romans  resided in it After the Departure of the Ro∣mans as the same Authority gives out the Kings of  Northumberland  kept their Residence in it and had their House now called  PandonHall  It was a safe Bulwark having the  Picls Wall  on the Northside and the River  Time  on the South This Place of  Pandon  is of such Antiquity that if a Man would express an ancient Thing it is a common  Proverb As old as  Pandon  Gate  Thus far this Author  Sect I  Of the  MANOURCHARE  BUT to treat of some Particulars of this ancient Town we shall begin then at the  ManourChare  which leads from  Pilgrimstreet  to St  Austin Fryers  This Chare which leads from  Pilgrimstreet  to  Jesus Hospital  and from thence to the Head of the  BroadChare  was in ancient Times called  Cowgate  This is plain from an ancient Writing in the Possession of Mr  Tho∣mas Waters  in  Pilgrimstreet  dated  Feb  in the th Year of  Edward  the th where are these Words describing the Situation of the House he pos∣sesses at present  Prout jacet in vico Peregrinorum infra villam Novicastri super Tynam inter Tenementum nuper Laurentii de Acton ex parte Boreali Tenementum nuper Thomae Clerk ex parte Australi extendit in Longitudine a via Regia ante usque vicum quondam vocatum  Cowgate  modo vocatum  AustynChare  retro  In the Reign of  Edward  the th it had the Name of  AustynChare  as appears al∣so from this Writing Now it has the Name of  ManourChare  which some imagine to be given from the Word Minor or Minorites or Franciscans but unless they can prove that the  Fryery  of the  Franciscans  was situated here they never can prove that the Chare was so called from them and this is scarce possible to be done For we have already shewn that the  Minorites  or  Franciscans  had their House in another Part of the Town  viz  in the  HighFryarChare  this is also clearly proved from the several Writings of the Com∣pany of Taylors that this Place was formerly called  Cowgate  and afterwards called the  FrearChare  or St  Austin FrearChare  These Writings of theirs also mention an Almshouse which went by the Name of  Ward  's Almshouse situated in this Chare I supposed it was situated at the Bottom of Mr  Wa∣ter  's Garden for I have heard some old People say they remember thereabouts the Ruins of an Almshouse  Cowgate  the ancient Name of the Street is still continued in one Part of it  viz  from the Foot of  Silverstreet  to the Head of the  BroadChare  HAVING come down this Lane from  Pilgrimstreet  we come to three different Ways that on the Right leads down into  Pandon  that on the Front leads into the  Town  's  Hospital  and that on the Left into St  AustinFryers  and  CarliolCroft  Sect II  Of St  AUSTINFRYERS  THE lefthand Passage has still the Remains of a large Gate which has been one of the Gates leading to St  AustinFryers  which having past this Gate is a little above upon the Right Hand There is still a compleat Quadrangle to be seen the Southside of which has undoubtedly been the Chapel This seems to have been the ancient Building for  Grey  seems to  speak of some sumptuous Additions that were made to it In succeeding A∣ges says he it was inlarged and beautified with stately Buildings Cloysters and a Fair Church The Kings of  England  since the Conquest kept House in it whence they came with an Army Royal against  Scotland  and since the Suppression of Monasteries made a Magazine and Storehouse for the North Parts Now of late that Princely Fabrick is demolished and laid level with the Ground The Pride Covetousness Luxury and Idolatry of these Hou∣ses brought a sudden Ruin upon themselves and Houses  THE same Authority tells us also that there was an antient Religious House founded by the Kings of  Northumberland  and that several of them were bu∣ried here but it cannot be true that they built any Thing for the St  Au∣stin  Fryers for they came not into  England  'till long after the Conquest in the Year Then it was that  Lanfrank  of  Milan  the first General of the  Eremites  of St  Austin  sent some of them into  England  to seek a Dwelling for themselves The  Augustin  Fryers held their first House given them in  Wales  at a Place called  Woodhouse  which before had belonged to the Family of the noble Family of the  Turburvills  Afterward  Humphry Bohun  Earl of  Here∣ford  and  Essex  in the Year of our Lord gave them a House and beau∣tiful Church remarkable for a Spire of wonderful Workmanship in  Lon∣don  which is now partly a Meetinghouse for the German Protestants who have settled in  London  Anno  the  Augustin  Fryers obtained Leave to eat Flesh upon Condi∣tion that they should keep the Fast of the Fryers Minors before Christmas  Stephen ad Vol  d  WHAT Year this House was founded in or this Order came to this House I have no where met with but the  Augustines  are said to have been founded by the Lord  Ross  De rebus Novocast'  the Baron of  Werk  which I am inclinable to believe very true for in the th of  Edward  the Second I find mention made of some Lands in  Cowgate  belonging to the Brethren of St  Austin  which were given them by  William Ross  who was Baron of  Werk  How much earlier than this King's Reign this Monastery was founded I have not been able to learn But it's probable it was sometime in the Reign of  Edward  the st and this I think is out of Dispute now for since this Conjecture of my own I received a Letter from the Rev Mr  Wearing  of  Bampton  in  Westmoreland  with the following  Account  King  Edward  the First in the th Year of his Reign gave Leave to one  John de Capella  to give and assign a Messuage of his in  Penrith  to the Prior and Fryers of the Order of St  Augustine  in the Town of  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  THEY surrendred on the th of  Jan    Hen    THE inclosed Ground all round it where is now the Pasture of  Nathaniel Clayton  Esq  Alderman the SurgeonsHall the Hospitals  c  did undoubt∣edly belong to them and were their Gardens  THIS House is now turned partly into a Workhouse for the Employment of the Poor Part of it is turned into a House of Correction a Dunghill  c  Here is the CharitySchool of the Parish of  All Hallows  which was built  Anno  and an House for the Master to live in which was built the same Year  THE Bells of  All Hallows  were cast in this Place which since the Decay of the  Monastery  was called rhe  Artilleryyard  from the Townsmens perform∣ing there the Exercise of the  Pike  and  Gun  BEFORE I have done with this Monastery it may not be amiss to men∣tion a Passage in  Milbank  's Manuscript which came to my Hands since the compiling of this Antiquity The Author of it says "When I was young  which was as I take it about the First of King  James  I Reign  there were  Cloysters  in this Monastery and a  fair Church  A  Scot  did beg it of King  James  after that took the  Lead  off it and sold it but it was cast a∣way before it came to its Market He sold also some  Stones  to Sir  Peter Riddel  who with them built the SouthEnd of his fine House but now it belongs to Captain  Dykes  and his Posterity hath no right  Sect III  Of  JESUS HOSPITAL  HAVING thus done with what relates to the Passage above mentioned on the  left Hand  let us enter that on the  Front  And this is what the People call the  Town's Hospital  but its true Name is  Jesus Hospital  for it was dedicated to the  Holy Jesus  You ascend to it by Stairs from the high Street and then enter into a  pleasing Field  on the Northside of which is the  said Hospital  It is three Story high and the Understory is adorned with Piazza's which are about Yards in Length and make a very agreeable Walk About the Middle of the Piazza's is the Entrance into the second and third Stories and over against this Entrance is a Fountain very much beautified for the Use of the  Hospital  THIS  new Hospital  commonly called the  Town's Hospital  in the Manours dedicated to the  Holy Jesus  was founded erected and endowed at the Charge of this  Corporation  Anno T Robson  Mayor  for a Master and thirty nine poor Freemen or Freemens Widows  THE Town allows them quarterly  s  and the Master  s  TOWARDS the Bottom of this Field is  another Hospital  erected for six poor Widows of  Clergymen  and  Merchants  which was endowed by the Cha∣rity of Mrs  Anne Davison  Widow of Mr  Benjamin Davison  Merchant and erected by the Corporation of  Newcastle Nathaniel Clayton  Esq  Mayor  Thomas Wasse  Esq  Sheriff  Anno    THEY have to subsist on  s per  Quarter each  Sect IV  Of the  BARBERSURGEONS  Hall  ON the East of this same Field is the Hall of the  BarberSurgeons  which was rebuilt by them in the Year  IT is a very beautiful one and not a little sumptuous it stands upon tall  Piazza's  under which is a very spacious Walk There is before it a fine Square divided into four Areas or GrassPlats surrounded with GravelWalks each of which is adorned with a Statue The First of the two next the  Hall is the Figure of  Aesculapius  placed upon a tall Pedestal upon one Side of which is the Motto  In the Area oppposite to this is the Figure of  Hippocrates  who bears an open Book with these Words in it  and on the one Side of the Pedestal  These were set up in the Year  John Shaw  and  Robert Golightly  Stewards  ON the other two GrassPlatts are the Figures of  Medicus Pergameus  or  Galen  and  Medicus Spagyricus  or  Paracelsus  which were erected  Robert Golightly  and  William Handby  Stewards I am inform'd by one of this Com∣pany that in a little Time the Wall at the Foot of the Garden will be taken away and instead thereof will be IronRails It will shew the Hall and Gardens to some Advantage but be rather too great an Ornament for such a dirty Part of the Town  THERE are besides this Square two other Gardens for Herbs which to∣gether with the  Hall  and  Garden  we have been speaking of are attended by a Gardner who lives there for that Purpose  Sect V  Of  WARD  's Almshouse  ALVEY  's Island  PANDON  Hall  WE now turn to the right Hand and descend the Chair towards  Pan∣don  and pass by Mr  Waters  's Garden at the End of which was  Ward  's Almshouse above mentioned of which I have lately met with the following Account from the  Milbank  Manuscript  The chief  Almshouse  in the Town is the  Ward  's near the  Manour  the  Mills  at  Pandongate  should give them as I remember  s per annum  to buy them  Coals  but old Mr  Brandling  pulled off the Lead on purpose to expel the poor People which he did The  Mills  are now fallen into one  Homers  's Hand and so is lost for ever I have seen the Writings and know it  Below this is a narrow Passage which leads into the  Carliol Croft  Below this again is a Place which was formerly called the  Island  as says Tradition It was so called because in former Times when the Tide flow'd up to the  Stockbridge  there was thereabout a  Hill of Sand  which at the Tide's leav∣ing of it appeared like an Island They call it at present  Alvey  's Island be∣cause it belong'd to one of that Name It is the very Place on which stands the  House Cellars  and  Malting  of Mr  George Hinkster  which are bounded on the West North and South by the King's Street and on the East by a waste Piece of Ground of the Lady  Goldsburgh  which was formerly called  the Stones  OPPOSITE to the South Front of this House was the ancient Building  viz Pandonhall  above mentioned but now rebuilt in some Measure There are still remaining many ancient Walls and Parts of this Building it was of con∣siderable Bigness having been according to Tradition on its Northfront in Length from the  Stockbridge  to  Cowgate  and on its Westfront in Length from its  Northwest Corner  beyond that Lane that leads into  Blyth's Nook  IT is of great Antiquity being built in the Times of the  Heptarchy  for it was the House of the Kings of  Northumberland  who liv'd in it for which Reason it was call'd  Pandonhall  Sect VI  Of  FISHERGATE  and  WALLKNOWL  FROM hence we go Eastward unto  PandonBridge  which is called the  StockBridge  It was undoubtedly of Wood in ancient Times tho' we meet with an Account of its being Stone when  Thomas de Carliol  was Mayor which was in  Edward  I Time at latest To this Place it was that the  Fishermen  brought up their Fish and sold them here as  Grey  observes from Tradition But to confirm this beyond the Force of Tradition it must cer∣tainly have been true that the  Fishmarket  was here because the Street you go into when you have past  PandonBridge  was formerly called  Fishergate  Now this is plain from an ancient Writing which was drawn when  Henry le Scot  was Mayor of this Town about the Year I shall give my Au∣thority at large because there depends upon it some other Things besides this  THE Writing is a Conveyance of some Land which is thus described  QUAE extendit in longitudine à communi via super le WallKnoll in australem Partem domûs Fratrum de monte Carmel usque ad communem viam quae solebat du∣cere versus  Fishergate  i e  WHICH Land extends itself from the Street of the  WallKnoll  to the Southside of the Monastery of the  Carmelites  even to the Highway which formerly led to  Fishergate  NOW it is certain this Monastery was at the Top of the  WallKnoll  the Remains of it are still in Being and shall be by and by further consider'd It is also certain from this ancient Writing that a Way led from the  Southside  of the said  Monastery  to  Fishergate  therefore this Street must be  Fishergate  because the common Way here spoken of could lead to no other Place I take this common Way to have been those  Stairs  beside Mr  Green  's House at the  Stockbridge  which lead up to the  Gardens  there and which were it not a  Wall  would lead directly from this Street to the Remains of this  Mo∣nastery  AS we go along from the  Stockbridge  we meet two Streets one on the left Hand and the other on the right That on the left Hand is called the  WallKnoll  which as it is a very great Ascent and high Hill from  Fishergate  so it seems to me to have this Name from the  Roman Wall  going along it for the Word  Knoll  signifies an  Hill  or  Eminence  as I gather from the Lord Bishop of  London  's Note in  Cambden  upon  Sevenoke  in  Kent  who says On the Eastside of it standeth  Knowll  so called because it is seated upon a  Hill  And  Grey  says also positively that it was Part of the  Picts  Wall  AT the upper End of the Street above mentioned towards the  Carpenters  The fol∣lowing Play coming too late to my Hands to be inserted in its proper Place I am obliged to mention it here It is intituled  NOAH  's ARK or The SHIPWRIGHTS ancient PLAY or DIRGE  Deus incipitur  ERE was this World that I have wrought  No

his Lead  That never a one of you thrive nor thee  FINIS Amen  Tower  are still to be seen the Remains of the Hospital of the  Carmelites  or  White Fryers  The East of their Church is still standing to the repairing of which  Roger Thornton  left in his Will two fother of Lead this Hospital be∣ing dedicated to St  Michael  gave the Name to it of St  Michael  's on the Mount  IT is said by  Dugdale  in his Baron  Lumley  that the  Roger Thornton  he is there speaking of was the Founder of the House of the  White Fryars  in  New∣castle  But this  Roger  can scarce be the Founder of it for I have proved him to be the younger  Roger  and it was taken Notice of above that  Roger  the Elder left Two Fother of Lead to it when he died so that if either of them be the Founder it must be the Elder rather than the Younger that  Dugdale  speaks of  BUT I believe it will be a difficult Matter upon Examination to prove either the Father or the Son the Founder of it for it boasts a greater Anti∣quity For this  Domus Fratrum de Monte Carmel  is mentioned in an ancient Writing which was drawn when  Henry le Scot  was Mayor about the Year in the Reign of  Edward  the st as is said above and therefore it must at that Time have been in being but the Elder of them was not Mayor of  Newcastle  'till Years after this so that it is impossible he should be the Founder and therefore much less his Son They might and probably they  both of them were  great Benefactors  or  second Founders  to it and so have been esteemed each of them  Founders  themselves  THEY surrender'd at the same Time with the Rest Sometime after they surrender'd King  Henry  the th made a present of this  Priory  and its Re∣venues together with some other Lands belonging to other religious Houses lying in  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  to Sir  John Gresham  Alderman of the City of  London  and  Richard Billing ford  Gent who st of  February  d  Edward  the th conveyed them to  William Dent  of this Town Gentleman What they conveyed was as follows  THE House or Priory of St  Michael de Wall Knoll  with the Things fol∣lowing belonging to it  This Or∣chard and Garden were undoubtedly the Gardens of  Swaddle Green Grey c  all that Ground which de∣scends into  Fishergate  a  Garden  and Orchard about an Acre of Ground a  Close  about Acres near the  Walls  of the Town  Messuages  three  Gar∣dens  and one  Close  also a  Close  called  Colerigges  and four  Les Rigges  in the  Sheild Field  also more  Messuages  in the  Town  and  Suburbs  belonging to the Monastry of  Tinmouth  also four  Tenements  and a  Garden  in this Town belonging to the Monastry of  Alnwick  also three Houses belonging to the  Nuns  of  Halystone  or  Holy∣stone  a Vil∣lage in  Nor∣thumberland  where in the Infancy of the English Church  Pau∣linus  is said to have bap∣tized many thousands  Halystone  also six Houses in this Town belonging to  Newminster  also a House in this Town belonging to the Monastry of  Blanchland  toge∣ther with every Thing belonging to the said Monastries in this Town of  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  IN the th of Queen  Elizabeth  this  William Dent  Alderman and  Wil∣liam  his Son conveyed this  Priory  together with an  House  and  Orchard  and a  Garden  containing an Acre of Ground to  William Jenison  then Mayor of  Newcastle  and  Richard Hodgshon  Alderman  Sect VIII  Of  CROSSWELLGATE BYKERCHARE  ABOVE when we went from  Fishergatestreet  we met two Streets that on the Left Hand we have already treated of The other I imagine is that which formerly went by the Name of  Crosswellgate  which is often mentioned in ancient Writings It is reported that the Dwellinghouse of  Roger Thornton  was in this Street Whatever Truth is in this it is certain that many Houses in this Street pay an Annual Rent to the Lord  Scarborough  to this Day into whose Family the Granddaughter of  Roger Thornton  was mar∣ryed There are in this Street several  Lanes  or  Allies  the first we meet with in going along from  Fishergate  is a Place called at present  Blyth  's  Nook  It is built over  Pandon Burne  The next is a narrow Lane leading to the  Burne Bank  a Place by which  Pandon Burne  runs into the  Tyne  It lies very low and before the Heightning of the Ground with Ballast and the Building of the  Wall  and  Key  was often of great Hazard to the Inhabitants once in particular a most melancholy accident happen'd in this Place in the Year the th of  Edward  the d the  River  of  Tyne  overflowed so much that  Laymen  and several  Priests  besides Women were drowned and as  Grey  says Houses were destroyed  Compleat Hist Eng Vol st P  BEYOND this again is a Chare called  Byker Chare  which seems by the a∣ged Look of several of the Buildings those especially at the  Northend  of the Chare where is the House of Mr  Henry Atkinson  Hoastman to be of great Antiquity Perhaps it got the Name of  BykerChare  from one  Robert  de Byker  and  Laderine  his Wife who had Lands in  Pandon c  See  Anno    BEYOND this again is  Cocks Chare Lovelane  c where are some Houses which deserve a better Situation  Sect IX COWGATE TRINITYHOUSE BROADCHARE  WHEN we came to  PandonHall  we went Eastward into  Pandon  it remains now that we go Southward from the same Place Leaving then  Silverstreet  on the Right Hand we come into  Cowgate  which has been a Part of the Town where some eminent Men have lived in such as  Gilbert de Cowgate Walter de Cowgate  c who were Men of Fortune and Estate Going forward we pass by  Blythe Nook  on the Left Hand and the  DogBank  on the Right and then we come to the  Broad Chare  a little below the En∣trance of which is the  Trinity House  which according to some was a  Mo∣nastry  dedicated to the  Holy Trinity  This Order of the  Trinity House  was founded by St  John de Matha  and St  John de Valois  in the Year in the Popedom of  Innocent  III The End of its Institution was the Redemp∣tion of Captives In the Year a Monastry was founded for this Order in  Kent  What Time this Monastry of the  Trinity  if there was such a one was founded in this Town we are intirely in the Dark Only it was said by some that  Laurentius  of  Newcastle  was its Founder If this be true it is not improbable but it was  Laurentius Acton  who was Mayor of this Town in and  c  WE are also equally at a loss as to its Situation For Bishop  Burnet  in his Collection of Records  P  says It was on the  Wallknoll  in  Newcastle  and that they surrender'd  January  th th of  Henry  the th If it was here I know of no Place to fix it in but where the  Carmelites  were and this could never be I am therefore inclinable to believe that this Monastry means that of the  Carmelites  and through a Mistake is called that of the  Trinity  BUT be that as it will it is certain that this Place called the  Trinity House  was no  Religious House  For it is said in our Account below to have been called of old Time  Dalton  's  Place  And besides had it been this  Religious House  the Mariners could not have got Possession of it 'till its Suppression which was on the th of  January  th of  Henry  the th whereas it was conveyed to them the th of  Henry  the th as the following Account testi∣fies  A Writing in the Custody of the Brethren of the  TrinityHouse  dated the th Day of  January  the th of the Reign of  Henry  the th which gives an Account of a Messuage and Garden which was convey'd by one  Ralph Heb∣borne  of  Hebborne  of  Northumberland  Esq  to the Fraternity of the Mariners It is the Place where is now the  Trinity House  which was in old Time called  Dalton  's  Place  IN the same Writing it is order'd that the aforesaid Messuage  c  shall be repair'd for Ever by the common Purse of the Brotherhood that in some convenient Part of it should be an  Hall  for the  Fellowship  to meet in at all  Times convenient for the observing of their Rules  c  and that in the Re∣sidue of the same there should be certain Lodgings order'd for such of the said  Fellowship  as afterwards should fall into Poverty or be not able to sustain themselves Those they held during the Term of their Lives and then were succeeded by others in the like necessitous Circumstances It was also order∣ed in this Writing that within the said Messuage there should be a Chappel and a Priest to sing and say Mass and other Divine Service therein as should be appointed by the Aldermen and Wardens of the said  Fraternity  for the Time being That the Priest and the said poor Persons so admitted should pray for the good Estate of the said  Ralph Hebborne  Master  John Hebborne George Hebborne  and for the Masters Souls and for the good Estate of the said  Fellowship  and for the Souls of such of the same  Fellowship  as be depar∣ted or hereafter should depart to the Mercy of God and also for the Souls of  John Dalton  sometime Owner of the said Messuage his Ancestors Souls and all Christian Souls  ONE Part of this Writing was to be put in a Chest belonging to the  Fellowship  and kept by them the other was to be kept in a Chest for that purpose in the Vestry of  AllHallows  in this Town in the Custody of the ChurchWardens for the Time being for Ever  THIS was further confirm'd to the  Fraternity  of the  Trinity House  by  Tho∣mas Hebborne  Son of the said  Ralph Hebborne  on the th of  September  in the th of the Reign of King  Henry  the th upon the Conditions following  viz  That the  Fellowship  should pay to the said  Thomas Hebborne  his Heirs or Assigns within the Town of  Newcastle  on the Vigil of the Apostles  Peter  and  Paul  in the Month of  June a Pottle of Wine  if it be demanded yearly for Evermore That the said  Thomas Hebborne  should be made a Brother of the  Fraternity  and Partaker of all Masses good Prayers and Suffrage which should afterwards be celebrated said and done by the Chaplain and Priest of the  Fraternity  within the  Trinity House  and at the  Trinity  Altar within the Church of  AllHallows  for Evermore with such Obsequies and Funeral Ce∣remonies as usually were done at the Burial of any Brother of the same  Fra∣ternity  if the said  Thomas  departs within this Town of  Newcastle  The Priest of the  Trinity House  at this Time was one Sir  Robert Ellison  TO this Writing was annex'd the Seal of the Town of  Newcastle  and the Names of the Mayor Sheriff and Aldermen  On  Oct  the th  Hen  Lighthouses were permitted to be built by the  Trinityhouse  to found edify make and build  two Towers  that is to say one on the North Part of  Shields  in the Entrance of the Har∣bour and a∣nother upon the Hill  KING  James  the st in the third Year of his Reign granted to the  Ma∣ster Pylots  and  Seamen  of  Newcastle  a Charter  SEVENTEENTH of  October  King  Charles  the d granted them an∣other Charter  AND a Third was granted them th of  July  by King  James  the d  IN a Manuscript I have frequently mentioned it is said that the  Trinity House  in the  Broad Chare  was held by the  Masters  and  Mariners  of this Town of the  Andersons  by giving them a red Rose at  Christmas  which  Bartram Anderson  turned to Wine and then sold it to Sir  Ralph Jenison  and it adds how they agree I know not It is at present a very pretty Building consist∣ing of a handsome Square very Monastick in it's Aspect having it's Appart∣ments or Lodgings for the Inhabitants a very neat  Chappel  and a magnificent  Hall  It maintains Persons allowing every one a  Chamber  eight Shillings  per  Month  Coals  and  Cloathing  There are also  extra  Persons which have allowed them some more some less  LEAVING this House of the  Marriners  we go down the  Broad Chare  without any Thing remarkable 'till you come to the  Keyside  about the Middle of it is a  Square  which goes by the Name of  Stonyhill  nigh it a Lane called  Spicerlane  which also leads on to the  Key  CHAP XII  Of the Suburbs and other out Places  Sect I  Of the  FORTH  W  ITHOUT the  CloseGate  is a pretty long Street with Houses on each Side which goes as far as a  Dike  called  SkinnerBourne  where are of late Years a Factory belonging to Mr  Thomlinson  a PotHouse to Mr  Joseph Blenkinsop  and  Ralph Harl  and a GlassHouse to Mr  Dagney  and Company from thence Northward at the Top of the Hill is the Place called the  Forth  anciently called the  Frith  which lies without the Walls of the Town and abutts on the South on a certain little Close called  GoosegreenClose  then it extends it∣self to a Close called  DovecoteClose  and from thence Westward by the fur∣thest Ditch of the  Close  which lies contiguous to the Corner of the Hedge which is next to the Common Way which leads into the  Forth  Then by and over the Common Way to the little Rivulet or Syke of Water in the Bottom of the Valley and so passing the Syke you go upwards to the Close called  GoosegreenClose  The Forth contains Acres of Ground It was surveyed by Order of the Parliament in the Year and valued at l per Annum  IT was valued Tythefree The Town pay'd l per Annum to the King for it  HOW it comes to be called  Forth  or  Frith  I can only conjecture The Word  Blount Law Dictio∣nary in verb  Frith  Forth  or  Frith  as it is anciently called comes from the  Saxon  Word  Frith  which signifies  Peace  For the English  Saxons  held several Woods to be sacred and made them  Sanctuaries  From this Definition of the Word it may be no improbable Conjecture that the ancient  Saxons  inhabiting about the Parts of the Wall where the Town now is gave the Name of  Frith  to  this Place as it was perhaps endowed with gloomier Shades and darker Re∣cesses the awful Excitors of Heathen Superstition than other Places about the Town were  IN the Reign of King  Henry  III a Licence was granted to the Townsmen of  Newcastle  bearing Date  Dec  d of his Reign to dig Coals and Stones  c  in this Place called the  Forth  And here it was as some think or rather as others in the  Castle Leases  that the first  Newcastle  Coals were wrought  IT seems to have been all along a Place of Pleasure and Recreation For it was an ancient Custom for the Mayor Aldermen and Sheriff of this Town accompanied with great Numbers of the Burgesses to go every Year at the Feasts of  Easter  and  Whitsuntide  to the  Forth  with the Maces Sword and Cap of Maintenance carried before them Undoubtedly the vast Concourse of both young and old at this Place at these Seasons of the Year rather than at any other about this Town is the remains of this ancient Custom  AFTER the building of the  Castle  it is said but without any just Autho∣rity that the  Forth  was anciently a  Fort  belonging to the  Castle  IN the Year  Part of it was turned into a pretty large BowlingGreen which was adorn'd with a broad Gravel Walk and a double Row of Trees around it It is at present a mighty pretty Place exceeding by much any Common Place of Pleasure about the Town On the Eastside of it you have a Prospect of Part of the Town's Wall through which is the Common Passage to and from this Place under a shady Walk of Trees on the West you View the Grounds of the Village of  Elswick  which have a gentle ascent to the Village itself a Place at the proper Season of the Year much frequen∣ted by the Town's People for its pleasing Walk and rural Entertainment  FROM this Quarter we view also as we do from the South the Banks of the River  Tyne  together with their Villages On the North is an House of Accommodation  GREY  says that it was given to the Townsmen for their Services by  Edward  III Whereas it seems to have been theirs in the Reign of  Hen  III However if the other Conjecture be true I verily believe it was given to the Town for that memorable Victory obtain'd by the Townsmen when the Earl of  Murray  was taken Prisoner which is commemorated in  Anno Christi    Sect II  Of  WARDENCLOSE  FROM hence we proceed to the Westgate which gives Name to a little Village within the Bounds of the County of  Northumberland  from whence still going on by the Outside of the Town's Wall we come to the  Warden'sclose  It seems to be called the  Warden'sclose  because it belong'd to the Wardens of the Priory of  Tinmouth  For  Grey  tells us he had his House Garden and FishPond c here This indeed is not improbable for the Monastery of the  BlackFryers  was dependant upon the Priory of  Tinmouth  And we are sure that this  Close  was Part of the Garden belonging to the  BlackFryers  in former Times And there are still the seeming Remains of FishPonds Gar∣dens  c  AT the Top of this Field towards the North is a Field call'd the  Shoulder of Mutton Close  because it is in the Shape of a  Shoulder of Mutton  which must formerly have been Part of the  Warden'sclose  In this is a Cistern of Water which a curious Friend of mine imagines supplyed the  BlackFryers  This perhaps may be true enough The Well belonging to this Monastry may pro∣ceed from it But I take its grand Use to have been to supply with Water the FishPonds and Gardens just now mentioned  Sect III  Of  NEWGATE Suburbs  THE Suburbs out of Newgate  Grey  informs us were ruined in the late Civil Wars However the Street  Gallowgate  so called because of the Way that the Malefactors of the Town of  Newcastle  go to the Gallows which is situated in a very low Place called the  Gallowshole  Is become again a very tollerable Street and a very pleasant Place having in it some good Houses which are situated in Gardens and Fields At the Top of this Street is a Lane which leads to the Westgate Quarryhouse  c  it borders upon a Field called the  Shoulder of Mutton Close  Sect IV  Of the  CASTLE LEASES TOWN MOOR  c  OPPOSITE to this Lane is the  Castle Leases  called anciently the  Castle Field  a large Piece of Ground belonging to the Town containing Acres Perches  Grey  informs us that Tradition said it was the Gift of King  John  to the good Men of  Newcastle  However this be it is certain that it had been the Town's immemorially or Time out of Mind in the Reign of King  Edward  III For in the st of that Reign the Town of  Newcastle  took an Inquisition in the  Castle Field  on a  Palm  Sunday Eve the st Year of King  Edward  III desiring the Confirmation of the Castle Moor and Field and the Privileges belonging to them And the King by his Letters Patents dated at  Westminster  confirmed to the Burgesses of  Newcastle  the other Charters they had obtain'd and also confirmed to them the Possession of the Castle Moor  Concessi∣mus pro no∣bis here∣dibus nostris quod predi∣cti Burgenses eorum he∣redes habe∣ant te∣neant mo∣ram ter∣ras predictas  Lib Cart p  and Castle Field they having belong'd to this Town immemorially at this Time He also as appears by the said Charters confirmed to the Burgesses of this Town and their Heirs the Liberty of digging Coals Stone and all other Advantages arising from the said Castle Moor  THIS Place was formerly the Inheritance of divers Persons Owners there∣of who were accustomed from ancient Time to take the fore Crop thereof yearly at or before  LammasDay  and after that by an ancient Custom all the Burgesses of this Town used to put in their Kine and used the same in pa∣sturing of them 'till  Ladyday  in  Lent  yearly and then to lay the same for Meadow again 'till  Lammas  IN the Year when  George Morton  was Mayor the Town purchased the Sweepage of the Castle Leases for the Benefit of the Burgesses  IN the d of  Charles  II a Licence was granted the Mayor and Burgesses to purchase the Sweepage of the  Castle Leases  THE Grounds of it abut on the said Castle Moor on the East and North Parts upon the Highway leading to  Kenton  on the West and on the other Way leading to the said Castle Moor on the South  WHEN the Parliament took an Inquisition of it the Forth and Town Moor in the Year were valued at l per Annum  THE Mill in the  Castle Leases  commonly called  Chimley Mill  upon the Syke or Rivulet called  BailiffBurn  and the other Mill called  Little Mill  were at the same Time valued at l per Annum each  THIS Ground was always valued Tythefree  ON the West and North of the  Castle Leases  lies the  TownMoor  It is a very spacious Piece of Ground containing Acres one Rood two Per∣ches It was originally a Wood very famous for Oak Trees out of which have been built many hundred of Ships and all the Houses of the old Town of  Newcastle  THIS  Moor  together with the  Castle Leases  or  Castle Lizards  called an∣ciently the  Castle Moor  and  Castle Field  were the Right of the Town of  Newcastle  and had been so Time out of Mind as has been just now observed in the Reign of King  Edward  III who in his Charter of the Town dated the Tenth of  May  in the st Year of his Reign confirmed the Holding and Possessing of it and the Working of Coals Stones  c  in it together with all the Profits arising from it in the same Manner he had confirmed all the Immunities and Privileges which had been granted by the Kings his Predecessors to the Burgesses of  Newcastle  THE ancient Bounds of the  TownMoor  which are the same to this Day and answer still in every Particular are thus described in the Charter abovementioned  ET quia ex parte Dilectorum Nobis Burgensium ejusdem Villae Nobis est Suppli∣catum ut cum Mora Terra Vocatae

Substance of which is it Bounders on a certain Street or Causeway called  GinglerDyke  and Bounders to a Street or Causeway called  Thorn∣busk  besides the Cross and from thence to the Bounders set towards the Town of  Newcastle  unto a Gallows set between the Trees or Posts of the  Gallhouse  so that one Post is placed and set in the Marches between the Fields and Lands of the Prior of  Tinmouth  and the Fields and Grounds of  Newcastle  and so extendeth unto the  QuarrelDyke  and from thence unto the  King'sStreet  and so on unto the said Village  IT is the Opinion of  Grey  some that this large Piece of Ground was the Gift of  Adam de Athol  of  Gesmond  to the Town But if the Town of  Newcastle  had an Immemorial Right to the TownMoor in the Days of  Edward  III and this is proved from his Charter abovementioned then it is very impro∣bable that  Adamarus de Athol  of  Gesmunde  should be the Donor of it For this  De reb Novicast p  Adam  was High Sheriff of the County of  Northumberland  in the Fifth of  Richard  II and was living in the Year of our Lord as appears by an Indulgence of Days granted to the Church of St  Andrew  's which was in the Proceedings upon a Dispute about Years after relating to the  TownMoor  It is declared that the  TownMoor  had belonged to the Town of  Newcastle  immemorially or Time out of Mind But how can it be said to be in the Possession of the Town for so long a Time when he himself who gave it lived thirty Years after this Declaration And if he did so no doubt but several others liv'd so long too Either then the Town was not at the Time of this Dispute immemorially in the Possession of this Ground or this  Adamarus de Athol  was not the Donor of it Again had he been the Donor of it he must have been Years old at his Death that is to say he liv'd thirty Years after this Dispute and Ninety before to make it immemorial which is the least Time that can be allow'd to make any Thing so so that these two put together will make that Number of Years at his Death It is not indeed in this Age of the World impossible for a Man to live so long but yet it is highly improbable There are few come to this Age and when they do they are look'd upon as so many great Exceptions to the general Rule of the Ages of Men and then their Ages stand upon Record to succceed∣ing Generations and no doubt had this been true of  Adam de Athol  it wou'd at least have been mention'd upon his  TombStone  but we find no such Thing Nay should we allow for the Sake of making him the Donor that he really lived Years yet after all this grand Absurdity would fol∣low that if the  Town  when this Dispute happen'd had had it immemorially he must have made a Present of it on the very Day he was born  FOR these Reasons therefore it's impossible he should be the Donor of it but some of his  Ancestors  of the same Name might And this is the rather to be imagin'd because Tradition says it was  Adam de Athol  of  Jesumund  hand∣ing down the Name to this Day As then he was of the same Name and undoubtedly a great Benefactor to this Town so the good Deeds of some of his Ancestors might have been ascribed to him through Mistake and so be handed down to this present Day There was one  Adam de Jesumuthia  or  Gesmund  who order'd that one  GoodPlank  or  SixShillings  should be given annually as may be seen in the Account of the  TyneBridge  for the Repara∣tion of the  Bridge  Perhaps it was him for the Bridge was burnt in the Reign of  Henry  III in the Year and immediately they set about the Repair of it and this  Adam  was one of the Benefactors to it If then Tra∣dition says true that  Adam de Jesmund  was the Donor of the  TownMoor  to the Town this is probably the very Man and whether he gave it before the Burning of the  Bridge  or at the Time of his Benefaction to the  Bridge  yet in the Thirty first of  Edward  III it would undoubtedly have been the Town's immemorially which is a good presumptive Proof of this Conjun∣cture that this was the very Man Be this as it will it is certain that it had been the Town of  Newcastle  's Time out of Mind in the Thirty first Year of  Edward  III and was then confirm'd to them as has been observed above in our Account of the  Castle Leases  TWO Fairs are kept upon this Moor on the First of  August  and Eigh∣teenth of  October  of which the  Tolls Booths Stallage Pickage  and Courts of  Picpowder  to each of the Fairs were reckoned worth  communibus Annis  l in  Oliver  's Time  IN the Survey made of the  TownMoor  in the troublesome Times it was reported that the  Coal Mine  or  Colliery  in the  TownMoor  extended it self under the Superficies of the  TownMoor one hundred Acres  and that the Value of it was to the Town  l per Annum  IT is the  Pasture  for the Cows belonging to the Freemen of  Newcastle  IT is much frequented by the Gentry of this Town and others for Exer∣cise and Health it being that Part of it especially call'd the  Cowhill  a Place of the most wholesome Air about the Town  Of the  NUNMOOR  THE  NunMoor  is that large Piece of Ground that lies on the West of the  TownMoor  between the  ThornBush  and the  Hedge  that separates from it the Grounds of  Kenton  RICHARD  I confirm'd to St  Mary  's and the  Nuns  of  Newcastle  what∣soever had been given them by  Asalack  the Founder of that  Hospital  as is observable in his Charter of the Founding of St  Mary  's whatever belonged to him as well in Land as in Money or Houses whatever he had acquired and obtained both within and without the Town of  Newcastle  all these he confirmed and he himself also gave them two  Carucates  of Land of his own that they might pray for his Soul This is supposed to be the Charter for the Confirmation of  Nunfield  or as it seems to have been otherwise called  Nunhouse  in the  TownMoor  And if this Conjecture be true it is clear that this  Asalack  gave the  NunMoor  to the  Nuns  of St  Bartholomew  and not as is commonly reported  Adam de Athol  These  Nuns  were the  Occasion  of it's being intituled  Nunfield  or  Nunhouse  or the  NunMoor  as it is called at this Day  IN the Fourth of the Reign of  Henry  VII Dame  Joan  Prioress of the Monastry of St  Bartholomew  the Apostle in  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  and Con∣vent of the same granted a Lease of the  NunMoor  for an hundred Years to the  Mayor Sheriff Aldermen  and  Commonality  of this Town under the year∣ly Rent of one Pound three Shillings and four Pence Hence it is plain that this Moor belonged to those  Nuns  and took it's Name from them  IN the Eleventh of  Henry  VIII there was an award between the said  Priory  and  Convent  and  William Bennet  Esq  Owner of  Kenton  about the Bounders of it  IN the Thirty sixth of the same Reign it was granted to  John Broxholm  in Consideration of  l    s    d  and was conveyed by those claiming un∣der him to the  Mayor  and  Burgesses  of  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  THIRTY Seventh  Hen  VIII upon an Inquisition then taken and returned into the  Exchequer  of Lands belonging to Religious Houses  Nunmoor  is cer∣tified to be within the County of  Northumberland  THE other Parts of the Suburbs out of  Newgate  is a Street that reaches as far as the  Barrasbridge  called  Sidgate  which consists of Houses very indiffe∣rent most of which are inhabited by poor People but very sweetly situated having the  Leases  or Gardens behind them  Sect V  Of the Suburbs of  PILGRIMSTREET  WE come now to the Suburbs of  Pilgrimstreet  gate which were also ruinated in the late Civil Wars But at present it is a very well built Street having in it some very pretty Houses such as are the Houses of Mr  John Stephenson  Merchant Mr  John Morris  Hoastman and several be∣longing to Mr  William Graham  c  THIS Street is the most Pleasant Situation of any within or without the Town  IT stands as it were in the middle of Gardens and Shady Fields which make it a delicious Place in the Summer Season  IN the upper Part of it nigh the  Barrasbridge  are to be seen the Remains of the Hospital dedicated to St  Mary Magdalen  which was vulgarly called the  Maidlein  's It was seated at the Summit of an Hill beneath which is the Well called St  Mary Magdalen  's Well so named from the Hospital as are al∣so several Fields which to this Day are called the  Maidlin  Meadows  IT was founded by King  Henry  I for a Master Brethren and Sisters to re∣ceive  Leprous Folks  and since that Sickness abated for the poor of the Town in Time of Pestilence Fourteen within the House were allowed every one a Room  s per  Month Coals and Fifteen without some  s per  Month some  s  some  s    d  ONE  Johannes de bland obiit die mensis proximo ante festum Sancti Mi∣chaelis arch∣angeli hora nona illius diei

was the Master of this Hospital in the Reign of  Edward  III he was a Man of a fair Character and good Reputation It is recorded of him that he died the Day before the Feast of St  Michael  the Archangel or on the th of  September  in the ninth Hour of that Day in the Year of our Lord His Body was buried nigh the HighAltar on the North side of the Chancel in St  Mary Magdalen  's Chapel  HE was a great Benefactor to this Hospital as appears from his Charity and Generosity in the first Year of his Mastership For whereas  Laurentius Acton  had the said Hospital in perpetuum for himself his Heirs and Assigns this worthy Man paid for his own Right Marks to the said  Laurentius  and the said  Laurentius  had the first Fruits belonging to the said Hospital which yearly amounted to the Sum of Marks  ONE  Richard Sperman  had an annual Pension from the said Hospital of Marks which Pension the abovementioned Gentleman in the d Year of his Mastership bought out for the said Hospital  HE also the same Year freed the said Hospital from an annual Pension which was payable to  Hugo de Mitford  THE same Master of this Hospital in this same Year following built in the said Hospital a Consistory a Stable and a Bier and made in the Quire two New Windows facing the South of the said Chapel besides a Number of other good and generous Charities which he bestowed upon this Hospital  THE same Gentleman proves judicially in the King's Court that the Mayor and Commonalty of  Newcastle  upon  Tine  did assign present and in∣duct the Master of the said Hospital He was Master of the said Hospital about five Years  IN the Reign of our Lord in the th of Queen  Elizabeth  one  Edmund Wiseman  Servant to the right Honourable Sir  Nicholas Bacon  Knight and Keeper of the Great Seal of  England  obtained by the Procurement of one  Cuthbert Bewick  a Burgess and Merchant of this Town of  Newcastle  a Pre∣sentation from the Queen of the Hospital of St  Mary Magdalen  lying with∣out the Wall of  Newcastle  of which Hospital the Mayor and Burgesses of this Town were the true and very Patrons and had till then presented Time out of  The WestSpittle the Hospital cal∣led the  Mag∣dalens  and the Chapel of St  Thomas  the Martyr have been given by the Mayor and Burgesses of  Newcastle  Time out of Mind  Mind By Virtue of this Presentation from the Queen  James  Bi∣shop of  Durham  would have inducted the said  Wiseman  in the Year afore∣said betwixt  Lammas  and  Martinmas  into the Possession of the said Hospi∣tal but the  Mayor  and  Aldermen  of the Town having Respect to the Defence of their Patronage would in no wise permit the said Bishop to give Induction therein For the Hospital of St  Mary Magdalen  was a Donative and not a Benefice inductible by any Bishop  IN the Year th  February  the Mayor and Burgesses of  Newcastle  granted the next Presentation of St  Mary Magdalen  commonly called the  Maid  enes  to  Henry Anderson Robert Mitford  and  Christopher Mitford  IN the Account of  FicketTower  there is Mention made of a  Great Cross  standing within  MaudlinBarras  and in the  Milbank  Manuscript it is said  At the End of the  Barras  Bridge before the Chapel stood a stately Cross firm and compleat  and  This  Pigg  was a Rebel a very great  Enthusiast  a Monument of his whimsi∣cal Head is that  StonePillar  a lit∣tle North of the three  Mile Bridge  which every deservedly to this Day bears the Title of  Pig  's Folly  John Pigg  in the Time of the Rebellion took it down and called it Idolatry and thought to make his own Use of it but it was broke by some who hated it should be prophaned This Hospital at the Suppres∣sion was valued at  l    s    d  LEAVING St  Mary Magdalens  we go forward to the End of this Street which together with the End of the Street leading from  Newgate  meets at the  BarrasBridge  HOW it comes by the Name of  BarrasBridge Grey  gives us no Account Others have imagined it to be so called from a Person of that Name who was its Builder or Benefactor This Conjecture in my Opinion is a grand Mistake for we have just now mentioned the  MaudlinBarras  and therefore the Word  Barras  must imply something else The Manuscript above men∣tioned speaking of the Antiquity of St  Andrew  's Church gives this as a Reason of its being the oldest in Town because it is next the  Barras  which hath been the ancient  Barracado  of the Town So then according to this Ac∣count it got its Name from the Word  Barracado  This also in my Opinion is a Mistake For the Word  Barrows  for so it should be spell'd signifies the same as  Tinnuli  Hillocks and sometimes  Graves  and  Sepulchres  And when it is considered that the Hospital of St  Mary Magdalen  was founded for the Reception of  Leprous Folks  it is easy to see that the  MaudlinBorrows  are the  Tombs  or  BurialPlaces  of those that died of the  Leprosy  in that  Hospi∣tal  and since the Burialplace it self was nigh to the Bridge the Bridge got thence the Name of the  BarrowsBridge  The  Barras  mentioned in the Ac∣count of  FicketTower  are the same Thing nothing else but the Burialplace of the  Franciscan Friars  THE Place of the  Maudlin Barrows  I take to be the sick Man's Close for as after the abating of the Leprosy this Hospital was obliged to take the Poor of the Town in during the Time of the Pestilence so I question not but those that died were buried in the ancient Burialplace or Barrows of the Hospital And since we are certain they were buried in the  sick Man  's  Close  we may  be therefore almost certain that the  sick Man  's  Close  was the  Barrows  of this  Hospital  THE  BarrowsMill  belong'd to the  black Friars  and in the Year paid a Rent to the Town of  Newcastle  of  s per annum Lib Cart p    THE Chapel on the other Side the  BarrowsBridge  was dedicated to St  James  the Apostle and was anciently called St  See  An∣drew  Tower  James  's Kirk I suppose it was a  Chapel  of Ease to St  Andrew  for  Jesmond  and  Sandiford  and other Outparts of that Parish  Sect VI  Of the Suburbs of  PANDON  THE Suburbs out of  PandonGate  are but very few Houses but there are  Gardens  all the Way up the Causeway two of them are those of Mr  John Simpson  and Mr  Charles Atkinson  This Way was within these four Years the pleasantest Entrance into the Town of  Newcastle  having Gardens on each Side beset with  Trees  of so large a Size and Shade that they covered the Street itself in several Places These were cut down for a little unpossest Money and the greatest Beauty of the Street lost  THERE are in this Street two or three Passages leading to different Places which it may not be amiss to mention After you are out of  Pandongate  there is one on the left Hand leading to  PandonDean  a very  Romantick Place  full of Hills and Vales through which runs  PandonBurn  It is a very entertaining Walk in the Summer to  Magdalen  Well A little above this is another very narrow Passage on the right Hand bordering upon Mr  Harrison  's Garden which leads to a Place called the  GarthHeads  which was a Place of Pleasure and Recreation but of late it was taken in and made a  common Gar∣den  of by  Richard Ridley  Esq  the Proprietor of it  HAVING past this Lane we proceed till we come to the Top of this great Ascent for such indeed is this Street and there we meet with two Ways the one leads to the  ShieldField  the Property of Mr  Charles Clark  of  New∣castle  which has been already mentioned and the other to  OwseBurn  which is at present a large Village occasioned by the Coalworks of  Richard Ridley  and  Matthew White  Esqs  c  IT takes its Name from the Burn that runs through it The Banks of this Burn are in many Places terribly high in all Places beautifully Roman∣tick  BEFORE we come to the Suburbs of  Sandgate  we must not omit to men∣tion the  Keelmens Hospital  it is situated some Distance East of the  Town's Wall  between the  Carpenters Tower  and  Sandgate  It is a square Building done in the Form of  Monasteries  and  Colleges  having its low Walk round it in Imitation of  Cloysters  The Area in the Middle of it is about Foot broad and about ½ Foot long There are upwards of fifty Chambers in it Who it was built by may be learned from the Inscription above the En∣trance of it which is as follows  The Keelmens Hospital built at their own Charge  Anno Domini Matthew White  Esq  Governour Mr  Edward Grey  Mr  Edward Carr  Stewards of the Hoastmens Company for the Time be∣ing  and Trustees for this Hospital  I have been told that Dr  Moor  one of the late Bishops of  Ely  upon going down the River in the Town's Barge with the Magistrates observed it and made Enquiry after it And being told that it was built by the  Keelmen  themselves every one allowing towards it a  Penny a Tide  he said that he had heard of and seen many Hospitals the Works of  rich Men  but that was the first he ever saw or heard of which had been built by the Poor 'Tis a great Pity that the Design of its Building is not throughly answer'd but there are some Miscreants who would rather starve in Sickness or old Age than not guzzle a Penny in their Health and Youth  Sect VI  Of the  Suburbs  of  SANDGATE  THE Suburbs of  Sandgate  excepting some Houses nigh the Walls of the Town we are informed escap'd the Fury of the Civil Wars This Street has it's Name from it's Situation which is upon the Sand For this whole Street as well as the  Sandhill  and all the lower Parts of the Town in ancient Times was the Common Sand or Shore of the River  THIS Street has in it a vast Number of narrow Lanes on each Side of it which are crouded with Houses It is chiefly inhabited by People that work upon the  Water  particularly the  Keelmen  The Number of Souls in this Street and the Lanes belonging to it is computed to several Thousands  ABOUT the middle of this Street is an open Place called the  Squirrel  from a little Brook of that Name which runs through it into the River  Tyne  which was the ancient Bounds of the Town of  Newcastle  From this as far as the House of Mr  Jeremiah Cook  Shipwright is the Street of  Sandgate  then we enter St  Ann  's Street so called from the neighbouring Chapel which leads us on to the  Ropery  which is a long and pleasant Walk giving an agreeable Prospect of the River and a great Part of the Town and Neighbouring Places What this Ropery was formerly  Grey  gives us the best Account Below East says he is the BallastHill where Women upon their Heads car∣ried Ballast which was taken forth of the small Ships which came empty for Coals which Place was the first Ballast Shore out of the Town since which Time the Trade increasing there are many Ballast Shores below the Water on both Sides of the River much the same Account is given of this in the Manuscript so frequently mentioned the Hoastmen got Leave at first to lead Coals above the  Bourn  and that occasioned their Delivery of Ballast upon the  LimeKiln  Road and the Women bore the Ballast upon their Heads and made the BallastHills for the Town had procured all that Shore of the Lords of  Byker  for that Use and to build LimeKilns upon  ON the North of this Ropery stands the Chapel of St  Ann  which is a a Chapel of East to the Church of  Allhallows  which tho' pretty large is yet much too little for the Parish it being perhaps one of the largest Parishes in the whole Kingdom  WHEN it was originally built I have met with nothing that gives any Ac∣count after the Reformation it was neglected and came into Decay but the Town in the Year repair'd it and settled a Lecturer there to preach in the Morning and to expound the  Catechism  every Sunday Afternoon which the Town allow'd  l  per Annum for at the Opening of it after it was repaired the Rev Mr  March  then Vicar of the Town preached the first  Sermon in it which was Printed and Intitled  Th'  Encaenia  of St  Ann  's Cha∣pel in  Sandgate  IT has at present two Lecturers which are paid by the Town the Rev Mr  Clayton  and the Rev Mr  Maddison  to the former the Town pays  l per Annum  and to the latter  l  BELOW this to the Glasshousebridge are the Houses of ShipWrights and MasterBuilders such as Mr  Thomas Wallas  Mr  Roger Durham  Mr  John Lattany  Mr  Cuthbert Preston  c  THE  Glasshousebridge  so called because of the  Glasshouses  which are al∣most contiguous to it was originally a WoodBridge as the Bridge higher up the  Bourn  was 'till within these or Years but in the Year when  Ralph Jenison  Esq  was Mayor it was made of Stone by  Thomas Wrang∣ham  ShipWright on Account of Lands which the Town let him The Passage however over it was very difficult and uneven 'till the Year When  Stephen Coulson  Esq  was Mayor it was made level and commodious both for Horse and Foot  ON the other Side of the Bridge are the  Glasshouses  which in  Grey  's Time served most Part of the Kingdom with WindowGlass  SOMETIME in the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  came over to  England  from  Lorrain  the  Henzels Tyzacks  and  Tytorys  The Reason of their coming hither was the Persecution of the Protestants in their own Country of whose Per∣suasion they were They were by Occupation Glassmakers At their first coming to this Town they wrought in their Trade at the Closegate after that they removed into  Staffordshire  from whence they removed again and settled upon the River Side at the Place called from their abiding in it the  Glasshouses  Deservedly therefore have so many of these Families been named  Peregrines  from the Latin Word  Peregrinus  which signifies a Pilgrim or a Stranger  HAVING at last settled here they became very numerous and generally married into each others Families to preserve the three Names of  Henzel Ty∣zack  and  Tytory  But the latter of them within this Few Years became ex∣tinct There are of the  Tyzacks  several remaining but the  Henzels  are most numerous  AS you go from the Glasshouse you come now to the  Glasshouses  a large Village and pass by the Western Glasshouse then to the CrownGlasshouse then to the middle Bottlehouse then to the middle Broadhouse then to the castern Glasshouse Nigh this last is the House of the late Mr  Peregrine Henzel  the principal Person then remaining of his Family and one of the Chief Owners of these Works  FROM hence we pass over the Grounds of St  Laurence  to a Place consi∣sting of several Houses which from a Chapel here situated dedicated to St  Laurence  is called St  Laurence  's Glasshouse or MushroomGlasshouse there is also here a Bottle Glasshouse now held under the Town by Mrs  Middle∣ton  of which  Richard Ridley  Esq  is an Owner  ST  Laurence  's Chapel or Chantery as it is called is said to have been built by one of the Earls of  Northumberland  No Doubt that Prayers might be put up for his Soul and the Souls of his Family  AT the Reformation it had Fate of many Chapels of the like Kind to have its Revenues disposed of and itself left to fall into Ruins  IT was dependant upon the Priory of St  John  's of  Jerusalem  It was gran∣ted  to the Town in the d of  Edward  VI among other Things in Conside∣ration of  l    s

called the  Swerle  in Time past in the County of  Northumberland  and now in the Town of  Newcastle  on the Westside of the aforesaid Town along by the Shore of the Water of  Tyne  unto the Fields of the Town of  Elswick  in the aforesaid County of  Northumberland  by and along the Fields of the Town of  Elswick  aforesaid unto the Fields of the Town of  Fenham  was hereto∣fore a Village very pleasant and beautiful on Account of it's much Wood but now much more so be∣cause of the very fine House and Gardens of  Thomas Ord  Esq  This Village or the Royalty of it belong∣ed to the Pri∣ory of St  John  of  Je∣rusalem  for we meet with a Receipt from the Prior to the Town of  Newcastle  for the Coal Mines of  Fenham  Fenham  in the afore∣said County of  Northumberland  and so toward the North unto the Fields of the Town of  Kenton  in the aforesaid County of  Northumberland  and along by those Fields unto the Town of  The Estate of  William Carr  Esq  Coxlodge  in the aforesaid County of  North∣umberland  and so towards the East of the Fields of the Town of  Jesmund  in the aforesaid County and by and along the same Fields of  Jesmund  towards the South unto a certain Bridge called  Barrasbridge  in the aforesaid County of  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  and from the same Bridge in and through a certain Lane in the aforesaid County of  Northumberland  and  Newcastle  leading towards the East to another Bridge called  Sandiver  Bridge in the aforesaid County of  Northumberland  and from the same Bridge towards the South in and through a certain Field called  ShieldField  in the aforesaid County of  Northumberland  and  Newcastle  unto a certain Lane or Street in the same County leading to the aforesaid Water or River of  Tyne  THE additional Bounders are mention'd in the second and third Years of King  Edward  VI  THE Circumference of the Town's Bounders is Miles and Yards  CHAP XIII  Of the River  TYNE  I  T remains now that we speak of the River  The  Tyne  seems to have been original∣ly as to the Name of it  Vedra  For the River  Ve∣dra  is the only River taken Notice of by  Ptolo∣my  in these Parts and we all know that in these Parts the Ri∣ver  Tyne  is the most con∣siderable  There is in∣deed a  Tyne  mentioned by  Ptolomy  but that is situated between the  Tay  and  Forth  in  Scotland  but neither can that be it it is too inconsiderable Nor lastly can it be the  River Were  tho' there is a nigher Affinity in Sound between  Vedra  and  Were  than between  Vedra  and  Tyne  For the  Vedra  is mention'd by  Ptolomy  as the most considerable River and 'tis confessed that the  Tyne  is more so than the  Were  or if the  Were  has any Claim to the Name of  Vedra  it is only in Conjunction with the River  Tyne  Perhaps says Mr  Horsley  p  Vedra  has been the Name of the  Tyne  and  Were  The Tract that now has between the two Rivers and is bounded on each Side by them is now called  Werewickshire  Tyne  which is indeed a River to be outdone by few in the whole Kingdom whether you respect it's Haven it's Com∣modities it's Privileges which have been frequently mentioned the Prospect of it's Fields it's Woods and Villages  c  As to the Haven it is so deep as to carry Vessels of a considerable Burthen and of that Security that they are not in Danger either of Storms or Shallows save that within a little of the Bar of  Tinmouth  which are called by the  Sailors  the  BlackMiddens  which are very dangerous but to prevent any Mischiefs which may happen to Ships in the Night Time from them there are two Lighthouses maintain'd by the TrinityHouse in  New∣castle  and near them in the Year was built a Fort called  Clifford  's Fort which effectually commands all the Vessels that enter the River  Mag Brit Vol p  MR  Cambden  observes that this Town of  Newcastle  for it's Situation and plenty of SeaCoal so useful in itself and to which so great a Part of  Eng∣land  and the low Countries are indebted for their good Fires is thus com∣mended by  Johnson  in his Poems on the Cities of  Britain  Novum Castrum  Rupe sedens Celsâ rerum aut miracula spectat  Naturae aut solers distrahit illa aliis  Sedibus Aethereis quid

Place when the Coal Trade is brisk that all other Business is so too and when it is otherwise through the Contracts of the Coal Owners or of the Masters that there is a certain Deadness in all Tra∣fick It is the Money arising from the Coal Trade that almost entirely Cir∣culates in this great Town and adjacent Country  IT has been observed by  Fleetwood Preciosum Chronicon p  some that Sea Coal has not been in Use above Years at least not in  London  and that when we meet with Coals in old Accounts it is meant of Charcoal I can scarce be of this Opinion if it was but for what the said Authority himself acknowledgeth  viz  that  Carbo Ma∣rinus  or Sea Coal is mentioned in  Matthew Paris  And in the st of  Edward  III there is mention made  de Carbonibus marithnis  of Sea Coals and the Mea∣sure of them  HOWEVER this be nigh this Town of  Newcastle  Coals were work'd very early in a Charter of King  Hen  III dated  Dec  d of that King's Reign Licence was granted to the Town of  Newcastle  to dig Coals in the  CastleField  and the  Frith  IN the Year the th of  Hen  V Twopence per Chaldron being paid to the King for all Coals sold at the Port of  Newcastle  to People not enfran∣chised it was enacted that the Keels should be of the Burthen of Chal∣drons and no more according to Custom some being of the Burthen of and some of Chaldrons built to defraud the King of his Customs and that the Keels should be sealed by the King's Officers  De reb    QUEEN  Elizabeth  demanding of the Town the Arrear of  d  per Chaldron which had been neglected for many Years the Town begg'd her Majesty that these Arrears might be forgiven and to grant them a  Gardner  Queen  Eliz  Charter  Charter to incor∣porate a new Fraternity or Brotherhood to be called  Free Hoastmen  for the selling and vending of all Coals to Shipping And in Consideration thereof they would pay to her Majesty and her Successors  d  for every Chaldron exported from thenceforth to the free People of this Nation this was taken into Consideration and granted  IN the Year in the Time of the Civil War the City of  London  re∣ceived a great Advantage by this Town's being taken for almost two Years bypast the poorer Sort of People had been almost starved Coals hav∣ing risen to the Price of  l  per Chaldron a Price never known before that Time  THIS Place is generally computed to vend upwards of Chaldrons aYear There are likewise vast Exportations of Lead Salt Salmon and Grindstones which last Commodity as  Grey  says and is still true are con∣veyed to most Parts of the World according to the Proverb  A Scott a Rat and a Newcastle Grindstone you may find all the World over  IT is not in my Power to describe the Number of Arts and curious Ma∣chineries that are used in this Affair of the Coal Business the sinking of Pits Winning of Coals FireEngines WaggonWays the Waggons their ma∣naging of them the Staiths  c  deserve a more skilful Pen Thus much however I may venture to say that those WaggonWays a small Part of the whole Coal Works may vie with some of the great Works of the  Roman  Empire  The Right and Title of the Mayor and Burgesses of the Town and County of the Town of  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  to the Soil and also to the Conservation of the River of  Tyne  st By  Prescription  THE said Mayor and Burgesses have time out of Mind enjoyed the Soil of the said River or

Conservation of the said River of  Tyne  AND for Conservation and Preservation thereof there has also time out of Mind been holden before the Mayor and Aldermen of the said Town every Monday a Court in which Court Enquiry is made after the due Conser∣vation and Preservation of the said River of  Tyne  by a Jury sworn to present all Nusances done therein who make Presentments thereof in Writing whereupon the Offenders are summoned and if Guilty are punished by Fine or Imprisonment  BUT formerly there has been another Custom for punishing such Offenders as appears by the following Testimonial  A Testimonial of  John Philips  's and  William Goodwin  's cutting each a Purse in the Town's Chamber for casting Ballast in the River of  Tyne  Villa  Novicastri  super  Tynam  WHEREAS Information upon Oath was given that  John Philips  Master of the  Mary  of  Hull  and  William Goodwin  Master of the  Elizabeth  of  Wisebidge  did the th of this Instant cast Ballast within the Fathom deep

the Town Chamber and did there acknowledge and confess the said offence and did lay down  l  a Piece which was put into two Purses which they cut ac∣cording to the ancient Custom of this Corporation

Thomas Welsh  Thomas Young  Christopher Ellison  Thomas Goftyn  THIS ancient Custom of cutting a Purse  c  was confirmed  Anno  by an Order of the King and Council  THEY the said Mayor and Burgesses have also Time out of Mind had a Water Bailiff who is a sworn Officer and other Officers whose offices are to search out offences done in and upon the said River of  Tyne  and to exe∣cute the Orders of the said Court  AND they the said Mayor and Burgesses have also always cleansed the Port from Rubbish Ballast and Sand either brought in by Storms or otherwise into the said River of  Tyne  THE

Places in the said River Buoys and Lights are set and Persons employed and paid by the said  TrinityHouse  for looking to and taking Care of them  dly  By  Acts of  Parliament  IN an Act of Parliament made in the st  Hen  VIII Chap there is an Express Clause which gives the Mayor and Burgesses Authority to pull down all Wears Gores and Engines in the River of  Tyne  between  Spar∣rowHawk  and  HedwinStreams  and in the Preamble of the said Act it is de∣clared that the Soil of the River of  Tyne  c has been Time out of Mind enjoyed by the Town of  Newcastle  in their Demesne as of Fee in Right of the Crown  AND also in another Act of Parliament made the d of  Edward  VI not printed It is declared that for the Maintenance of the said Town of  New∣castle  upon  Tyne  and for the Preservation of the Port and said River of  Tyne  all the Sands called Shores are settled on the Town  AND also by Letters Patents  Eliz  which confirm to the Mayor and Burgesses of the said Town of  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  their Customs which they had by Prescription or otherwise It is in particular granted to them to have Jurisdiction of a great many Statutes mention'd in that Charter and amongst other Statutes the Statute  Hen  VIII chap which concerns the Con∣servation and Preservation of Rivers  dly By  Judgments Records Inquisitions Judgment in Quo Warranto Verdicts at Law Decrees in the Court of  Exchequer  and  UPON one Decree there is a perpetual Injunction which was afterwards confirmed in the House of Lords on an Appeal  JUDGMENT in Parliament  Ed  I where the Prior of  Tinmouth  having Lands adjoyning to the said River of  Tyne  at  NorthShields  and having built a Shoar there within the Flood Mark it was adjudged that it should be re∣moved at the Cost of the Prior It may not be amiss to give some Account of this Trial  The Contents mentioned In a Plea at  Westminster  in the th Year of  Edward I  Between the  King  and the  Burgesses  of  Newcastle  and The  Prior  of  Tinmouth  Quod Do∣minus Rex habere de∣beat totum Portum in aqua de  Tyne  a mari usque ad locum qui dicitur  Hed∣winstreams  c  st The whole Port in the Water of  Tyne  d His Ovens at  Newcastle  The King Dues  d For every Quarter of Corn there baked th of Custom th the King looseth at  NorthShields  for the Issues of Baking  per Annum    l  and by the Forestalling of the Market there  l  The said Prior also taketh the Wreck of the Sea which specially belongs to the King  THE King could also take two Tunn of Wine to be chosen behind and before and every Tunn of Wine for  s  of every Ship of Herrings Her∣rings  c  all which the said Prior takes at  Shields  and else where by which Means the King lost his Prises and Customs due to him because the same Merchandizes came not intirely to his due Port of  Newcastle  THE Prior also built Ovens at  Tinmouth  which were rented at  l    s    d  per Ann and kept a Market on the Lord's Day at  Tinmouth  It was also ob∣jected to him that the whole Country and the Mariners applied themselves and sold their Goods and Merchandizes at  Shields  to the King's great Detri∣ment he receiving no Toll nor other Profits for the same  THE King ought to have the Towage of Ships and Boats greater and smaller in the River of  Tyne  in going up to  Newcastle  and down to the Sea freely over any Lord's Land  c  The King ought to have in his Port  d  for every Boat that has an Oar and  d  for every lesser one that has none  In  Answer  THE Prior said the Premises did only touch his free Tenement and he answered that as for the Wreck of the Sea the Forestalling of Merchandi∣zes  c  He and his Predecessors had them by Charter of King  John  Grand∣father of King  Edward  I and so he proceeds to his new Town of  Shields  HE said also that he had no Market or Oven at  Shields  But as to the Fish∣ers and buying of Fish he saith that his Predecessors in their Times have al∣ways had their own Fishers fishing in the same Water for the Maintenance of their House Toll free  c  because the Port of the Water of  Tyne  doth especially and entirely belong to the King and that they meaning the Prior and Convent of  Tinmouth  have had certain their Tenants of  Shields  with their Boats within their Demesnes  AND as for the Market at  Tinmouth  he said he claimed none there but he had a Tumbrel and had hired Fishers Brewers and Bakers and also Sham∣bles there  AS to the Charge of Towage he said that he never hindered those that exercised any such Office in the Water of  Tyne  adjacent to his Land save only at  Elstwick  or  Astwick  HE said moreover that before and at the Time of making King  Richard  's Charter which was before any Liberties granted to  Newcastle  by King  John  the Priors of this House took and had all the Premises freely and quietly  c  by virtue of Custom of Liberties granted to them by their said Charter by Land and Water whereof he found his Church seized  c  WHEREUPON he demanded Judgment  THOSE who prosecuted for the King said that the Charter was worth nothing As to the Wreck of the Sea they said no sooner had the Ships applied themselves out of the great Sea into the said Port and there had the Misfortune to break then the said Prior taketh the Goods of such broken Ships both swimming and therein abiding and Converts them to his own Use and that the then Prior was seized of ten Tuns of Wine out of a cer∣tain Ship of  Peter  of  Appleby  Burgess of  York  wrecked in the said Water  AND as to the charging or discharging of Ships and of Merchandizes  c  they said that whereas the said Port of  Tyne  is only the King's as often as the Prior should do so the King was manifestly injured being then and al∣ways before in Seizin and Possession of the said Port  AS to the Town of  Shields  they said that whatsoever small dwelling Houses there had been there  c  the said Prior that then was caused there to be made Houses upon the King's Soil because they are comprehended within the flowing and Inundation of the Sea and they demanded the Record of Ju∣stice that the said then Prior alledged that the King therein hath no soil  c  but that it merely belong'd to him even to the  This is sup∣posed to be the LowWater Mark  Fill of the Water  THEY also said that in those Houses at  Shields  there were Fishers and Brewers and Victuallers  c  so rich that they were able to give Loading and Victuals for or Ships which ought to apply themselves at  New∣castle  upon  Tyne  and there buy their Victuals for the bettering the said Town Whereupon they said that the said Prior is the only Occupier of the King's Soil and the only Taker away of the said King's Town of  Newcastle  and that he the said Prior had Fishers or more with great Boats fishing in the Sea yearly for Traffick's Sake only and not for Maintenance of his House where∣of the King received neither Toll nor Custom  THEY said also that the said Prior and his Men come out with their Hor∣ses and Carriages and out of such Ships as came thither got Necessaries for themselves so that most Times Ships and Boats return empty and half laden to other Ports than to  Newcastle  aforesaid whereby the King cannot receive his due Prises and Customs  AND after they said that  John  of the  Vale  I suppose  De le Val  being Judge Itinerant  Edw  I It was then reported by the Jury that the Prior of  Tin∣mouth  built a Town upon the Bank of the Water of  Tyne  on one side and the Prior of  Durham  levied or built another on the other Side where no Towns ought to be unless Lodges only for Fishermen and that the Fishermen have there sold their Fishes which ought to have been sold at  Newcastle  to the great Hurt of the said Town and Loss of the King's Prises And that both the said Priors of  Tinmouth  and  Durham  have caused to be made Brewers and Fishers having great Ships whereas they ought to have but Boats and have caused Bread to be baked there which ought to have been baked at  New∣castle  IT is inhibited and forbidden the said Prior of  Tinmouth  that from thence∣forth he should not hold or cause to be held a Market or Fair in the afore∣said Places and was determined that the Port within the Water of  Tyne  from the Sea to  Heddon Streams  is the free Port of the King and his Heirs with it's Prises Customs Towages Tonages with all other Profits and Commodities incident and belonging to the same  c  and that neither at  Tinmouth  nor at  Shields  Ships are to be laden or unladen  IT was also ordered that Ovens at  Tinmouth  should pay Damages Marks and those that took Tonnage and make Forestal  c  and as to the Wrecks of the Sea  c  that the King and his Heirs should have them for ever here∣after as to the Markets and Fairs that there be not at  Tinmouth  or  Shields  any Market or Fair and that neither at  Tinmouth  or  Shields  there be any Sale of Things saleable as in Meats Drinks or any other Things whatsoever whereby the King his Heirs and Successors may be made the Worse  IT was also ordered that the Keys and other Things levied and raised by the said Prior within the Flood Mark on the King's Soil should be removed at the Costs of the said Prior  Close Roll  Ed II  Membran  It is recited that the King had given Power and Authority to  John  Earl of  Hamstead  to examine and remove Nu∣sances done to the River of  Tyne  and was pleased to recal it because it was a Prejudice to what the Mayor of  Newcastle  claimed and enjoyed in the Time of his Predecessors  BY an Inquisition th  Jan    Hen  VI the Jury upon their Oath found that beyond the Memory of Man the Town of  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  had and held of our Sovereign Lord the King and all his Predecessors as Bur∣gesses of the said Town when there was no Mayor and as Mayor and Bur∣gesses of the said Town when there was a Mayor the said Town and Wa∣ter of  Tyne  and the Soil of the said Water of  Tyne  wherever it was covered from a Place called  Sparrow Hawk  in the Sea unto a Place called  Hedwin

of this Place to be small and not able to maintain a Minister made an Augmentation of  l  a Year to it since the Restoration of King  Charles  II  Magn Britan Vol    p    THIS Manour is now Part of the Estate of his most noble Grace  Charles  Duke of  Somerset  THE next Village to it is  Stella  a little below  Newburn  on the other Side the Water Here is a magnificent House and Gardens which belonged to the Lord  Widdrington  which became forfeited to the Crown in the Year for his entring into the  Northumberland  Rebellion This Place origi∣nally belonged to the Nuns of  Newcastle  it is now chiefly inhabited by CoalWorkers and has Staiths in it  THERE are many other Villages on the Sides of this River such as  Blaiden Lemmington Swalwel Delaval Redheugh  c Several of them have Staiths belonging to them such are the Staiths of the Lady  Clavering  Sir  Henry Liddel  Baronet  Richard Ridley  Esq  George Liddel  Esq  Edward Wortley Montague  Esq  George Bowes  Esq  George Pitt  Esq  George Malliber  Esq  Mr  John Simpson  and Mr  Joseph Ledger  THERE is a little Island in the Midst of the River called  The King's Meadows  which is a delicious Place and a great Ornament to the Ri∣ver  LET us now come below Bridge to take Notice of a few Things there  Gateshead  presents itself first a Town in the Bishoprick of  Durham  it stands on the Southside of the  Tyne  opposite to  Newcastle  and is a Place of great Antiquity Mr  Cambden  thinks it a Place of equal Antiquity with  Newcastle  because of it's ancient Name  Gabrosentum  but I have already proved it more rational to believe it to have been only it's Suburbs  THERE was an ancient Monastry here in the Time of  Bede  which was the Monastry of  Utanus  it was where Mr  Riddle  's House or  Gateshead  House is as it now stands  ON the of  May    Walter  Bishop of  Durham  was murdered at this Place The Occasion of it was this  Walter  attending more wordly Affairs than the Charge of his Flock gave himself altogether to Temporal Business wherein he wholly occupied himself He bought of the King the Earldom of  Northumberland  and then making himself a secular Judge took upon him to sit in the Court and to determine all Causes at his Pleasure dealing withal very corruptly and taking still the Course that might be most for his own  Gain Hereupon he greatly enriched his own Coffers but purchased unto him∣self extreme Hatred amongst the Common People which was his Destruction in the End There was a certain Gentleman of great Account named  Leul∣fus  that married  Algitha  the Daughter of  Aldred  sometime Earl of  Nor∣thumberland  from whom the Lord  Lumley  that now liveth is lineally descend∣ed This  Leulfus  to the end he might live near the Church in his latter Time and for very Devotion came to  Durham  to dwell there and kept Company very much with the Bishop who loved him entirely for many good Parts he saw in him as namely his Wisdom in discerning his Equity in deciding and his Discretion in ordering and handling such Causes as he committed unto him in which Respect also he used him very familiarly employed him often and gave him what Countenance he could Now you shall understand that unto the same Bishop belonged two Men unto whom for the most Part he committed the ordering of all his Affairs  Leofwyn  or  Leobwyn  his Chaplain whom he trusted with all HousholdMatters and  Gil∣bert  a Kinsman of his own that dealt in his Causes of Temporal Govern∣ment In their Offices they behaved themselves so as the Bishop had Cause to commend their Diligence but to blame their Rashness and Wilfulness in many Things which notwithstanding he bore withal either because their Industry and Care of his Affairs so blinded his Eyes as he could not espy their Misbehaviour otherwise or else being loath to detest them whom he had once advanced These Men and especially  Leofwyn  did greatly envy the Credit that  Leulfus  had gotten with the Bishop and every where opposed themselves against him not only in Words traducing his Actions but in Deeds also thwarting and crossing his Endeavours whereby it came to pass that many Jars fell out between them One Day amongst the rest a Court being held in the Presence of the Bishop  Leofwyn  or  Leobwyn  for so also I find him called according to his wonted Manner gave  Leulfus  ill Speeches which he not enduring to bear as heretofore he had done  furor fit saepius lae∣sa patientia  answered this sawcy Chaplain somewhat more roundly than he had been accustomed Whereupon he rose straight from the Court in great Indignation  Leofwyn  I mean and calling  Gilbert  aside with little ado per∣suaded him to carry a certain Number of armed Men to the House where  Leulfus  lay and in a Night to kill him which indeed he performed with great Cruelty murdering not only the innocent Gentleman himself but also his Servants and whole Houshold The News of this horrible and outragi∣ous Cruelty coming unto the Ears of the Bishop amazed him very much and suspecting it was done by the Advice of  Leofwyn  turning about unto him  O  Leofwyn saith he  thou hast already slain me by thy Tongue  So not doubting it would breed much Danger unto him he got into his Castle and presently dispatched Messengers unto the Friends and Kindred of  Leulfus  that was slain protesting that the Fact was committed without his Knowledge that he was marvellous sorry for it and if any Man suspected him would be ready to submit himself to any Order of Law whereby he might clear him∣self Herewith they seemed to be satisfied but for Conclusion of a firm Peace amongst them it was thought fit they should meet and consider of the Matter They met at a Place called  GoatsHead  the Bishop for his better Safeguard betook himself unto the Church with his Company the People whereof an infinite Number were gathered together abode without Mes∣sages a while past between them but the more the Matter was debated be∣ing very odious of itself the more the People were incensed At last it was told them how not only  Leofwyn  but also  Gilbert  had been harboured in the Bishop's House and afforded Countenance by him since the Murder which being once heard and it was true enough they all cried out it was mani∣fest that the Bishop was the Author of this Fact It is furthermore delivered by  Matthew Paris  that the Bishop not only before this amongst many intol∣lerable Exactions laid upon the Country by him had commanded the Sum of  l  to be levied at this Time That being also remembred while as all the People stood in a murmuring doubting what Course to take one of some special Regard amongst them slept up using these Words  Short read Good read slay ye the Bishop  Hereupon without more ado they ran all unto the  Church killed so many of the  Bishop  's Retinue as they found without Doors and with horrible Noise and Outcries bid him and his Company to come out unto them Too late then he repented that he had committed himself unto the Fury of a discontented Multitude with whom he knew himself before that Time nothing gracious But to make the best of a bad Match and to try all Means of ridding himself from the Danger imminent he persuaded his Kinsman  Gilbert  there present to go forth unto them if happily his Death which doubtless he had deserved might satisfy their Fury and purchase Safety unto his Lord and Master  Gilbert  was content and issuing out with divers of the Bishop's Company were all slain except only two  Englishmen  Servants unto the  Bishop  all the rest were  Normans  They being not yet satisfied he besought  Leofwyn  whose Life he knew well was principally sought to go out also But he utterly refused so to do The Bishop there∣fore going unto the Churchdoor entreated them not to take his Life from him protesting himself to be utterly guiltless of the Blood of  Leulfus  and shewed them at large how dangerous it would be to them in particular and what Inconvenience would follow to the whole Country in general if they should defile their Hands in shedding his Blood an unarmed Priest a sacred and consecrated Bishop their Ruler their Governor their Magistrate Hoping  Lastly  That his very Countenance his Gravity his Age and the Sight of his Person might move them to Compassion for he was indeed a very reve∣rend Man to see to very tall of Stature Head and Beard as white as Snow his Face fresh and well coloured and every Way very personable he went out carrying a green Branch in his Hand that so he might testify his Desire of Peace When he saw that all this availed not and the People ran furiously upon him he cast his Gown over his own Head in like Sort as we read  Ju∣lius Caesar  did in the like Case and permitting himself to their Fury with in∣numerable Wounds was pitifully massacred together with all his People and Retinue to the Number of an hundred only  Leofwyn  yet remained within the Church and being often called would not come forth so they set the Church on Fire Not enduring the Fire he leaped out of a Window and was immediately hewn into a thousand Pieces The Monks of  Yarrow  came and fetched away the Bishop's Body which they found stark naked and could hardly know it for the Multitude of Wounds they carried it to their Monastery from whence it was conveyed to  Durham  and there buried on the Southside of the Chapterhouse but secretly for Fear of the Murderers that roved up and down the Town and once assaulted the Castle When they found that they could not prevail there they dispersed themselves and for the most Part came to evil and unhappy Ends The King in the mean Time hearing of this Tumult sent his Brother  Odo  Bishop of  Bayan  with many of his Nobles and a great Army to take Punishment of this Murder which while they sought to revenge they brought the whole Country to Desolation Those that were guilty prevented the Danger toward them by Flight so as few of them could be taken of the rest that stayed at Home some were unjustly executed and the rest compelled to ransom themselves to their utter impoverishing and undoing The chiefest Doer in this Outrage was one  Eadulsus  sirnamed  Rus  descended of the Earls of  Northumberland  who as some say slew the Bishop with his own Hands and afterwards by the just Judgment of God was himself slain by a Woman and his Body tho' once buried in the Church of  Godworth  was taken up by the Command∣ment of  Turgost  Prior of  Durham  and forbidden Christian Burial At this Time  Odo  took away from the Church of  Durham  certain Ornaments of great Value amongst which is especially remembred a certain Crosier of inestimable Price In this Bishop's Days and by his Endeavour secular Clerks were dis∣placed and the Church of  Durham  replenished with Monks the Pope the King and the Archbishop allowing this Alteration  Goodwyn Fol    AFTERWARDS this Church was new built and placed where it now stands For according to Tradition it stood before in the Field below where BrickKilns now are  THIS Church of St  Mary  's  Gateshead  is in the Gift of the Bishop of  Durham  but once during the Vacancy of the See it was given to  Robert de Plesuys  the Value of it then was Marks  per Annum  IT is at present a very neat pretty Church being exceeding well pew'd having a small Organ and a Ring of eight Bells which were last Year

as appears by what follows  PHILIP  by the Grace of God Bishop of  Durham  to all Men of the whole Bishoprick and of his Brotherhood in all  England  he saluteth  Know ye that we have granted and by his present Deed have granted to our Burgesses of  Gatesheved  full Liberty of Forestage yielding in every half Year from  Pentecost  to the Feast of St  Martin  for a Wheye or Ox the which goes to Grass  d  and for a Horse  d  and for every Hog  d  in re∣spect of all Things that they have to proper and necessary Uses saving these prohibited Neither shall it be lawful for any Forester within the Meats that are appointed within our Forest and Burrough to Tax Lands upon any Burgess or upon any Manner of Thing of the said Borough or upon any Oxen or any other their Cattle or by any Ways to hinder them either of their Wood Tim∣ber or any other Things And if any Suit or Trouble shall be between the Foresters and Burgesses it shall be determined in the said Burrough if it may be if not then in our Presence it shall be determined And the Cattle of any Burgess shall not be carried out of the said Burrough but there shall be reple∣vied if the same may be replevied To the same Burgesses it shall be lawful to have Herbage and lying Turfs and Bruery to their own proper Uses where∣soever they are accustomed to have the same so that they sell us Part thereof And if any Burgess do dig Turfs for his Chimney not having Oxen if for the Leading of Turfs they shall be forced to have Oxen nevertheless in giving for all or every Ox which they shall need  d  of Forestage they shall be freed And it shall be lawful for every Burgess to give Wood to whomsoever he will  to be spent about the River of  Tyne  without any Licence but not to sell any without Licence of the Foresters And no Forester shall disturb any Mer∣chandize that cometh within the said Meat And every Burgess of  Gatesheved  shall have of his Burgage the same Liberty which the Burgesses of  Newcastle  have of their

which they ought to have of  Subtwell Meadows  as they were wont to have as in Deeds of good Memory of our Predecessors reasonably is contain'd  IN the th of  Edward  VI the Mayor and Burgesses of  Newcastle  peti∣tioned the King that the Town of  Gatesheved  in the County of  Durham  ad∣joining to their Corporation only the River of  Tyne  between being popu∣lous and without Government and often committing many Outrages in their Town and then got over the Water into the Town of  Gatesheved  unpunished and that often they cast Rubbish into the River and also that the Bridge went to Decay very much which belonged to that Town humbly beseech∣ing That his Majesty would be graciously pleased to incorporate that Town with them under their Government with all its Members and Saltmea∣dows and Park and that it might be quite taken from the County of  Dur∣ham  and all the People therein to become subordinate to their Laws  WHEREUPON it was enacted the whole Town of  Gatesheved  with the SaltMeadows the whole Water and Bridge with all the Liberties there∣unto belonging except the Common which should remain to the Inhabi∣tants should be incorporated with  Newcastle  and disjoined from the County of  Durham  as  Newcastle  was from  Northumberland  by Charter  Gardener  p  FIRST  Mary  so soon as Bishop  Tunstal  was created Bishop of  Durham  he petitioned her Majesty to restore  Gatesheved  to the County of  Durham  again and that the said Act th  Edward  VI might be repealed and it was repealed accordingly and enacted that the Town of  Gatesheved  should be free from the Corporation of  Newcastle c Gardener  p  ON the same Side of the  Tyne  a little below are the Fields called the  SaltMeadows  IN going down the Water we meet with several Staiths such are the Staith of  Richard Ridley  Esq  and  Matthew White  Esq  at the GlassHouse Bridge the Staiths of  Richard Ridley  Esq  at St  Lawrence  and St  Peter  's Keys of  Walter Blacket  Esq  and Mr  John Wilkinson  of  Francis Rudston  Esq  and of  Edward Wortley Montague  Esq  We meet also with several Keys such are  Winkemley BillKey WillingtonKey HebbournKey  c  WE meet also with several Villages such are  DentsHole  St  Anthon  's  Snowdon  's  Hole Howdon Panns Jarroiv  c  WHEN the Hoastmen renewed their Charter they had Licence to send Coals above the Bill and Mr  Coal  procured a Shore at  FriarGoose  Mr  Hen∣ry Chapman  procured a Shore upon  Hewith  Grounds and Mr  Robert Brand∣ling  with much ado got Leave to build a Shore upon his own Ground at  Fel∣lin  In the mean time the Tenants of the Dean and Chapter at  Durham  took Liberty to throw their Ashes into the River which did much Damage to the Bar Upon this Mr  Leonard Carr  and Mr  Cuthbert Bewick  com∣plained and the Town caused them to lay them upon the Land of which they have made mighty Heaps  WHEN King  James  I came to the Crown he was pleased to be bounti∣ful to his Countrymen amongst the rest Sir  Henry Gibb  being one of his Officers he bestowed upon him the Lordship of  Jarrow  and he would have procured a Shore there to cast Ballast but altho' he had the Favour of the King yet the Town used such Means and gave such Reasons to his Majesty and the Council that they found it detrimental to the Town and espe∣cially to the River so that he was utterly hindred and disappointed  BUT after the Death of King  Charles  I  Thomas Bonner  and  Robert Elli∣son  got in to be Magistrates and these Men having gotten Wealth and Increase by the Rebellion did purchase  Jarrow  and what could not be done before in a lawful Time they did bring to pass at this unlawful Juncture building a Shore and casting Ballast to the great Detriment of the River And hav∣ing the Town at Command Mr  Bonner  bought St  Anthony  's and  Robert Ellison  bought  Hebbourn  and there they both built Shores and got the Allowance of the Common Council when they were beyond Resisting And since that Mr  Carr  a Man that deserved well of his present Maje∣sty  CHARLES  II and the Town hath procured that his Brother  Ellison  for old  Ellison  's Son married his Sister should have Liberty to e∣rect his Shore to a great Length which in Time will utterly overthrow our Navigation for they will damn out the Indraught which maketh Rivers far off the Sea be walled out it will go by and not come in And some ancient and discreet Masters of Ships have said  They have not left a Birth to save their Ships in when any Landstood or Storm happens in the River  Mil∣bank  THE next Place  Jarrow  or  Girwy  as it was anciently called which is a small Village on the South Side of  Tyne  about Miles distant from  Newca∣stle  famous for a Monastery of learned Men but more so for the Birth Life and Death of  venerable BEDE  so named for his singular Sanctity who was born of mean Parents and at seven Years of Age deliver'd to the holy Abbot St  Benedict  to be educated in his Rule and being come to Age he professed a Monastick Life in the Abbies of  Weremouth  and  Girwy  where he became by his constant Application to his Studies so compleat a Scholar that few in that Age which bred many very learned Men were to compare to him for he was perfectly knowing in the Greek and Latin Tongues and no less perfect in Poetry Rhetorick Logick Physicks Metaphysikcs Astronomy Arithmetick all Ecclesiastical Calculations Musick Geometry Cosmogra∣phy History Philosophy and Divinity In short he had an exact Know∣ledge of all commendable Sciences insomuch that  William of Malmsbury  thus describes him He was a Man that may more worthily be admired than com∣mended for he was born in an extream Corner of the World yet the Light of his Learning spread over all Parts of the Earth he continued a most dili∣gent Learner 'till he was thirty Years of Age after which being ordained Priest he betook himself to Teaching and Writing All the Hours he had to spare from the Monastical Excerises of Prayer and Singing in the Choirs by Day and Night in which he was constant and very devout he most dili∣gently spent in his Studies so that his Life was a continual Intercourse be∣tween Devotion and Study he never repairing to his Study 'till he had been at Prayers nor ever went to Prayers but from his Studies by which continual Application he penetrated into all Sciences In his continual Deportment he was so grave and serious that the Title of  Venerable  was bestowed on him while he lived and ever continued to him after his Death It appears from History that he had at one Time those great Lights of the Church  Alcuinus  Preceptor to the Emperor  Charlemaign  and  Claudius  and  Clemens  the Foun∣ders of the Universities of  Paris  and  Pavia  for his Scholars  THIS Character is fully verified by the Books of all Sorts of Learning writ by him At the End of his Works he gives us a modest account of his own  Life together with a Catalogue of his Principal Works  Henry  of  Hunting∣ton  gives us also a large Catalogue of his Writings too long to be set down here Yet we cannot omit some of the Principal Works  viz  AN incredible Number of Treatises upon all Parts of the Old and New Testament many of which are still to be found in the  Bodleian  Library at  Oxford  ABOVE an hundred Homilies and many Pieces of Divinity and Devotion  A Small Book of the HolyLand  A Chronicle from the Creation  A Book of the Writers of the Church  A Martyrology  AN Epitome of the English History  OF the Scituation and wonderful Things of  Great Britain  THE Lives of many holy Men and Abbots with many others of all Sorts of Learning  THIS most excellent Person being grown old in the Study of Learning and all Christian Virtues grew weak and decripit for a Time and at length on the Tuesday before  Ascension  his Distemper grew so heavy upon him that Nature yielded to it and he died on  Ascension  Day in the seventy second Year of his Age But others say the Ninetieth  Anno  and was buried in his Monastery but afterwards his Body was translated to  Durham Magn' Brit' vol d  p  NOR is it to be admired that he should become so learned in his Monastery for in former Ages the greater Monasteries were like Universities wherein not only Humanity but all the Liberal Sciences Philosophy and Divinity were taught in the Year he received Deacons Orders from the Hands of  John  Bishop of  Hexham  afterwards called St  John  of  Beverley  and in the Year he was ordained Priest by the same Bishop  AMONG the several Ways of accounting for his Epithet of  Venerable  it has always been esteemed the most pleasing though perhaps not the most true Account of what is said to have happened after his Death  viz  that one of his Scholars designing to make his Epitaph in Hexameter Verse which began thus  Hac

Ecfridi Reg  Ceofridi A BB Ejusdem{que}  Eccles Deo Auctore  Conditoris Anno IIII  NOW the great Churches when the saving Light of the Gospel began to Shine abroad in the World for it is not impertinent to note thus much were called  Basilicae  because the  Basilicae  of the Gentiles namely those state∣ly Buildings where the Magistrates held the Courts of Justice were converted to Churches by the Christians whence  Ausonius Basilica olim negotiis plena nunc votis  i e the  Basilica  full of Business heretofore but now of De∣votion or else because they were built in an oblong Form as the  Basilicae  were  IN the Inscription the XUI should be XU for King  Elfrid  reigned no more than Years and so indeed Sir  James Ware  has given it in his Notes upon  Bede  's History of the  Abbots  of  Weremouth  But it ought not from this Inscription to be inferred that  Ceolfrid  was the Founder of this Monastry since it appears from  Bede  's Account that he was only constituted first Abbot of the Place by  Benedictus Biscopus  who sent him hither with a Colony of Se∣venteen Monks from  Weremouth Cambden  's  Britan'  p and  IN this Church is to be seen a very ancient Chair which Tradition says was the Chair of  venerable Bede  THE present Vicar of  Jarrow  is the Rev Mr  Robert Wilson  SOME Years ago upon the Banks of the  Tyne  was discovered a Roman Altar the Figure and Description whereof take here as it was delivered to the Royal Society by the ingenious and learned Dr  Lister  Fig  Fig  Fig  Fig  Fig  I have says he in his Letter to the Royal Society with much Trouble got into my Hands a Piece of  Roman  Antiquity which was but a very few Years ago discovered upon the Southbank of the River  Tyne  near  Sheilds  in the Bishoprick it is a very large and fair  Roman  Altar of one intire Stone but after all my Cost and Pains I am very sorry to find the Inscription very ill defaced and much of it is not legible and I believe it has been also much mishandled by those who have endeavoured to read it whereas if the Remain∣der of the Letters had been exactly measured and the Face blacked and light∣ly washed off again as in Prints some Things more might have been spelled  As to the Nature of the Stone itself it is of a coarse Rag the same with that of the Pyramids at  BurrowBriggs  it is four Foot high and was ascended to by Steps which appeareth in all the Sides but the Front has two Squareholes near the Bottom which let in the Irons that joined it to the Steps  I have carefully designed it on all its Sides and given the Plan of the Top also which if you please we will survey in Order  THE Backside opposite to the Inscription on which is engraven in BassRelief a FlowerPot furnished I suppose with what best pleased the  StoneCutter for these Men needed not be more curious than the Priests themselves who were wont to make Use of Herbs next Hand to adorn the Altars and therefore  Verbenae  is put for any Kind of Herb yet if we will have it resemble any Thing with us I think it is most like if not truly  Nym∣phaea  a known and common River Plant  ONE of the Sides which is somewhat narrower than the Front or Back On this are engraved in BassRelief the cutting Knife  Cecespita  and the Ax  securis  the Knife is exactly the same with that on the other Altar formerly by me mentioned in the Philosophical Collections of Mr  Hook  but the Ax is different for here it is headed with a long and crooked Point and there the Head of the Ax is divided into three Points  The other Side on which are engraved after the same Manner an Eure  Urceolus  and a Ladle which serves for a  Sympullum  This I call rather a Laddle than a Mallet it being perfectly Dishwife and hollow in the Middle altho'  Cambden  is of another Opinion in that elegant Sculpt of the  Cumberland  Altar and the very same Utensil I have seen and noted on the  Ickley  Altar which is yet extant at  MiddletonGrange  near that Town but the Stone which  Cambden  says supports a Pair of Stairs there as at this Day it does in the very Road is but an ill Copy of it and not the Original  THE Plan of the Top which is cut in the Figure of a Bason  Disons  or  Lana  with  Ansae  on each Side consisting of a Pair of Links of a Chain which rest upon and fall over two Rowles and this was the Hearth  THE Front which hath an Inscription in nine Lines in  Roman  Letters each Letter a little more than two Inches deep of our Measure now remain∣ing as in the prefixed Sculpture Fig which I would read thus  Dis De∣abusque Matribus pro Salute M Aurelii Antonii Augusti Imperatoris votum sol∣vit lubens merito ob reditum  The  Deae Matres  are well interpreted by  Seldon  It is much his Safety and Return both vowed should be so separated in the Inscription but I have not  Gruter  by me to compare this with the like  Caracalla  say the Histo∣rians  Ziphilinus Herodianus c  after his Father's Death at  York  took upon him the Command of the Army alone and the whole Empire he went alone against the Enemy who were the  Caledonii  inhabiting beyond the Wall which his Father had built he made Peace with them received their Hostages slighted their fortified Places and returned And this seems to be confirmed by the Inscription for undoubtedly upon this last Expedition alone without his Brother  Gera  and Mother was this Altar erected to him alone at a Place about two Sta∣tions on this Side the Wall so that the Vow might be as well understood of his Return from this Expedition as for his Sasety and Return to  Rome  which methinks should be true or his Mother and Brother  Geta  would scarce have been left out at least so early for yet the Army declared for them both according to their Father's Will  FURTHER it seems also to have been erected by those who flattered him and who were afterwards killed by him and for this Reason the Per∣sons who dedicated it seem to me to be Purposely defaced the sixth and seventh Lines of the Inscription being designedly cut away by the Hollowness of them and there not being the least Sign of any Letter remaining And this I sup∣pose might be Part of their Disgrace as it was usual to deface and break the Statues and Monuments of Persons executed of which this Monster made strange Havock and since worn Inscriptions admit of various Readings be∣cause some Letters are worn out and some more legible whereby unpreju∣diced People may conceive them diversly I will therefore tell you another reading Part of these two first Lines which I do not disallow but that it will agree well enough with the History of  Severus  tho' his  Apotheosis  or so∣lemn  Dedication was not performed till he came to  Rome  in the Manner of which funeral Pomp  Herodian  is very large it was of that excellent Antiqua∣ry Dr  Johnson  of  Pomfret  CONSERVATO RI B PRO SAL  c  Which shews the Height of Flattery of those Times so that they paid their Vows to the lately dead Father the Conservator of  Britain  for the Safety of the Son And the Story tells us how gladly he would have had him made a God long before even with his own Hands  Cambden Britan  in the Addi∣tions to  Durham  p  BELOW this are the Towns of  Shields  one on the  North  Side of the Ri∣ver and the other on the South That on the  North  Side in the Reign of  Ed∣ward  the st when the Contest was between the Town of  Newcastle  and the Prior of  Tinmouth  was a Place where only or Fisherman had their Cottages and it's but of late Years that it became a large Town and so popu∣lous The Churchbelonging to this Place was begun to be built in  SOUTH  Shields  is more famous for making Salt than North  Shields  there being much the greater Number of Salt Pans it is also a pretty large Town and has a Church which going to decay is about to be rebuilt It is a Cha∣pelry to  Jarrow  and dedicated to St  Hilda  WE come now to the Mouth of the River  Tyne  which is a Haven so deep as to carry Vessels of a considerable Burthen and of that Security that they are not in Danger either of Storms or Shallows save that within less than half a Mile of the Bar of  Tinmouth  which is a Sand that lies cross the River's Mouth not above Foot deep at LowWater you meet with many Rocks which are called by the Sailors the  Black Middens  which are very dangerous but to prevent any Mischiefs which may happen to them in the Night Time there are two Lighthouses maintained by the  Trinityhouse  in  Newcastle  and near them in the Year was built a Fort called  Clifford  's  Fort  which effe∣ctually commands all the Vessels that enter the River  LELAND  in the th Volume of his Collections gives us the following most valuable Remark of a Roman Station on the South Side of the  Tyne  the Place of the Birth of King  Oswyn  for says he  E Regione Tinemuthae suit Urbs vastata a  Danis  Ursa nomine Ubi natus erat  Oswinus  Rex  TINMOUTH  called by the  Britains Pen Ball Cragg i e  the Head of the Rampire upon the Rock from whence some maintain that the Ditch reached as far as this Place if the Wall did not Mr  Cambden  says that he will not gainsay this Opinion but adds that he dares confidently Affirm that this Place in the Time of the  Romans  was called  Tunacellum  which signifies as much as the Promontory of  Tuna  or  Tina  where the first Cohort called  Aelia Classica  because it was first raised by  Aelius Hadrianus  as the Name seems to import was in pay for Sea Service for the  Romans  had their  Naves Lusoriae  or light Frigates in their border Rivers both for the suppressing the Excursions of the neighbouring Enemy and making Incursions upon him as may be seen in the  Codex Theodosii  under the Title  De Lusoriis Danubii i e  Light Vessels on the  Danube  UNDER the  Saxon  Heptarchy this Place was called  Tunaceltep  not as  Bede  affirms from the Abbot  Tunna  a mere romantick Story which if we recommend to the Reader it must be only for his Diversion and not for any Truth in it but from it's Situation on the River  Tyne  Here was anciently  a little Monastery which was frequently plundered by the  Danes  while the  Saxons  ruled  Magn Britan p    AFTER the Decease of  Oswyn  those that had killed him brought his Bo∣dy to the Mouth of the River  Tyne  and there buried it in the Oratory of St  Mary  's in the Year  IN this Place a Number of illustrious Persons had gathered together who in a regular Order attended divine Worship who thereby acquired such Ho∣nour and Esteem that when any one died of more than ordinary Reputation whose Funeral was to be solemnized with more than common Honour he was usually buried here  THIS Monastery was destroyed by  Hinguar  and  Hubba  The Monks through Fear of Persecution fled to a certain little Church of their own which St  Cuthbert  had dedicated but the  Danes  finding them out burnt it and all that were in it  AFTER that  William  the Conqueror had given to  Robert Mowbray  the County of  Northumberland  the Earl shewed a deal of Respect to St  Oswyn  and the Church he was buried in for the Church was founded within the Precincts of his Castle He gifted it with a Number of Lands and placed in it Monks which came from St  Albans  and yet it is said by some that  Tosti  Earl of  Northumberland  laid the Foundation of this Monastery but it's much more probable it was the former because he brought the Monks from St  Albans  but it will appear a great deal more likely when we come to the following Grant or Charter of  William Rufus  for making of it a Cell to  Willielmus Rex Anglo∣rum T Ar∣chiepiscopo W

fortified and turned into a strong Hold was called  Tinmouth  Castle which Name it still bears and as such glories both of its Stateliness and Strength for as an ancient Author speaks it is inaccessibly seated upon a very high Rock towards the Ocean on the East and North and elsewhere so well mounted that a slender Garrison may make it good For this Reason  Robert Mowbray  Earl of  Northumberland  when he practised with certain Noblemen to dethrone  William Rufus  because he had not rewarded him according to his Expectation for slaying  Malcom  King of  Scots  and his Son but was set upon by the King before Things were ripe for Rebellion chose this Castle for his chief Hold and maintained it for some Time against the King and his Forces but being at length brought into great Straits by the Besiegers as Rebels seldom meet with Success he fled and betook himself to the adjoining Monastery which was accordingly com∣monly reputed an holy and inviolable Sanctuary nevertheless he was carried off thence and afterwards in a long and noisome Imprisonment justly suf∣fered Death for his Treason  Magn Britan  Vol p  JOHN of  Whethamstede  thirty third Abbot of St  Albans  was so called from the Place of his Birth a Village near St  Albans  but the Name of his Fa∣mily was  Bostock  he was a Monk of the Priory of  Tinmouth  and gave after he came to be Abbot a Chalice of pure Gold and of great Weight to that Priory his Character can't be better drawn up than in  Stephen  's Monasti∣con from whence we have this Account  Contegit iste lapis venerabilis ossa  Joannis  Wethamstede  Abbas hic qui fuit ejus in annis  Ter doctus doctos amans c  That is  This Stone covers the Bones of the Venerable  John Wethamstede  who was Abbot here in his Time most learned a Lover of learned Men and kind to them  He did not connive at any Faults in the Clergy he was as zealous as  Phineas  against lewd Persons and as  John  against Adulterers and even as  Pe∣ter  against Simoniacks He was so great a Repairer of old tatter'd Houses and Marks that none past exceeded him in that Particular or is there any equal to him He is recorded to have left behind him Ten thousand Marks clear Do you the Convent of St  Albans  hourly pray for the Soul of him that loved you  THIS famous Monastery which was of the  Benedictines  Order and con∣sisted of a Prior and fifteen Monks was suppress'd  Jan  th in the th  Henry  VIII It was valued at  l    s    d per annum  KING  Henry  VIII converted the Castle into a Defence and Fortification against foreign Invasions  THE Ruins of the Monastery are still to be seen in the Castle near which also was the ParishChurch but that being gone much to Decay and the Parishioners in the late Civil Wars being often debarred of the Liberty of a free Resort to it another was begun to be rebuilt in the Year and be∣ing afterwards finished was consecrated by Bishop  Cosins  in the Year In the former Church we may suppose it was where  Malcom  King of  Scots  slain with his Son  Edward  Prince of  Scotland  by  Robert Mowbray  Earl of  Northumberland  was buried This King  Malcom  had barbarously plundered and ravaged these Northern Parts five Times once in  Edward  the Confes∣sor's Days twice in the Conqueror's and twice in  William Rufus  's in the last of which Invasions he met with his Fate by that just Providence who often retaliates Wrongs in the Place they are done as he found for he was killed in this Country where he had slain and destroyed many But King  William  did not prosecute his Revenge further as he might have done with Success but established his Son on his Throne notwithstanding the Endea∣vours and Design of his Uncle  Donald  to deprive him of it which he had done had not King  William  aided him to obtain it  JOHN  of  Tinmouth  was born in this Town and is said to have been the Vicar of it but afterwards became a  Benedictine Monk  in the Abbey of St  Albans  he was a most virtuous Person and excellently learned entirely ad∣dicted to the Study of the Holy Scriptures and of sacred History He ga∣thered the Lives and Actions of the Saints of  England Wales Scotland  and  Ireland  with great Judgment and indefatigable Labour which Work he en∣tituled  Sanctilogium servorum Dei  i e  The sacred History of the Servants of GOD  Nor did he deserve less Commendation for his Expositions of the Holy Scripture in which he not only explains the literal Sense but the mo∣ral allegorical and tropological his Commentaries were upon all the Books from  Genesis  to the  Kings  inclusive He wrote also other Books as  ChurchLessons The Golden History  and a  Supplement  to the same an  Appendix  to his  Martyrology  c He flourished about the Year  THE Church has perhaps been a Building of as much Art and Curiosity as any one in the whole Kingdom nay when we behold it at present in the Midst of Ruins we are struck with Aw and the utmost Veneration whether it is a Reflection on the extensive Charity of ancient Days the sur∣prizing Fineness of the Masonry or whether there is something naturally moving in those ancient Remains but so it is that it never fails to command a solemn Aw and a silent Commiseration  TINMOUTH  at present is a pretty large Village and is much resorted to in the SummerSeason it having the Prior's Haven in it which is a most convenient retired Place for Bathing  CHAP XIV  Of the Government of the Town  W  HATEVER Government was in this Town in the Times of the  Saxons  and  Danes  it is certain after the Conquest it was governed by Bailiffs for tho' the Ca∣stle had Privileges of its own yet it left those of the Town as they were and without any Damage as shall by and by be shewn In the mean Time let us consider a few Things relating to this Place    TOSTON  Earl of  Northumberland  Son of the great Earl  Godwin  and Brother of  Harold  having by his great Cruelties and many Acts of Injustice highly exasperated the  Northumbrians  they took up Arms against him and expelled him  Northumberland  in in the Reign of  Edward  the Confessor  Harold  being ordered to go and chastize them and restore his Brother and understanding that they had no design of withdrawing their O∣bedience from the King but only from an unjust and cruel Governour who exercised over them a Tyrannical Power he not only interceeded for their Pardon but procur'd them  Morkard  Son of  Alfgar  Duke of  Mercia  for their Governour  Toston  highly incensed at his Brother's Proceedings and not having it in his Power to vent his Fury on him he turned it on some of his Domesticks whom he caused to be cut in Pieces then to be barrel'd up and sent to his Brother for a Present After so barbarous an Action not da∣ring to stay any longer in  England  he retired into  Flanders  to Earl  Baldwin  his Fatherinlaw Upon  Harold  's being made King after the Death of  Ed∣ward Toston  in with some Ships probably given him by the Earl of  Flanders  infested the  English  Coasts and plunder'd the Isle of  Wight  From whence he went and landed some Troops at  Sandwich  but being inform'd the King was marching towards him he set sail for the  North  and entring the  Humber  with his little Fleet he made a descent on  Yorkshire  and committed vast Ravages But  Morkard  coming upon him unawares being then got into  Lincolnshire  put his little Army to Flight and compelled him to betake him∣self to his Ships Being drove by contrary Winds on the Coasts of  Norway  he applied himself to  Harold Harfager  King of that Country and by many Arguments represented to him how easy it was to conquer  England  and add that Crown to his own The King of  Norway  whose Ambition was easily persuaded by the other's Arguments accompanied with Earl  Toston  put to  Sea with a Fleet of Sail and entered the  Tyne  After having sack'd the Countries on both Sides the  Tyne  they put to Sea and entring the  Humber  landed their Forces on the North Side and ravag'd the Country with iriex∣pressible Cruelties  Harold  march'd against them with all the Expedition pos∣sible and came up with them at  Stanfordbridge  on the River  Derwent  a lit∣tle below  York  Here a most bloody Battle was sought which lasted from seven in the Morning 'till three in the Afternoon wherein  Harfager  and  Toston  were both slain and  Harold  obtain'd a compleat Victory This Battle was fought  October  th but nine Days before the Battle at  Hastings Vide Malmsbury  and  M Paris  WILLIAM  the Conqueror laid waste the whole Province of  Northumber∣land Sax Chron  p    MALCOLME  King of  Scots  came into  England  with a great Army    and laid waste the Land of the  Northumbrians  as far as the River  Tyne  and slew many Hundreds of Men and carried of them to their Own Country a great deal of Riches and Treasure beside Captives  Gib Sax Chron  p  THE Castle was founded as has been before observed by  Robert  the Son of the Conqueror    ROBERT Mowbray  Earl of  Northumberland  revolting against King  Wil∣liam Rufus  the King went and besieged him in  Banborrough  Castle    Some∣time after  Mowbray  going out upon a false Information had the Misfortune to fall into the  Hands  of the Besiegers  Odericus Vitalis  says Some  Soldiers  belonging to  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  promis'd to give him Entrance into that Town if he would come thither privately with a few Followers Upon which he went out one Night with  Soldiers  but being betrayed by his own Men was pursued and taken by the Garrison of  Malvoisin  i e  bad Neighbour  be∣ing a Fortress built by the King near  Banborrough  and so called by him be∣cause it took away all Possibility of throwing any Succours into the Castle  IN this King's Reign  Malcolme  III King of  Scotland  came to  Gloucester  to the King to commune with him about sundry Matters that related to the Peace of both Realms but not being received and entertained in the pom∣pous Manner he expected he returned into his own Nation in Displeasure and immediately getting his Army together entred  England  and destroyed the Country as far as  Alnwick  Castle which he besieged and so straightned that it was upon the very Point of Surrendering a Soldier having promi∣sed to deliver up the Keys upon the Top of his Spear which while he pre∣tended to do he stabbed the King with it At the same Time  Robert Mow∣bray  Earl of  Northumberland  lay in Ambush for the Return of the  Scots  who upon the Loss of their King lest the Siege and being going home∣ward fell into the Ambush and were many of them slain and amongst them  Edward  Prince of  Scotland  Thus did Providence revenge upon King  Mal∣colme  the many Ravages and Cruelties he had exercised upon the  English  in this King's his Father's and the Confessor's Reign He was buried at  Tin∣mouth  and his Son by the Aid of  William Rufus  obtained his Throne  Magn' Britan Vol  III  p    AGAS  Mother to  Margaret  Queen of  Scotland  and  Christian

him secretly invited  David  King of  Scotland  to revenge the Injuries done to the Empress  Matilda  who was his Neice and to whose Succession both  Ste∣phen  himself and he had sworn in the Reign of her Father  Henry  the first upon which  David  suddenly invaded the Frontiers and as the Chronicle of  Mailross  acquaints us miserably waisted all  Northumberland  and took both  Car∣lisle  and  Newcastle  which he filled with Garrisons Against those King  Stephen  marched with a powerful Army and concerning this War there are divers Reports yet all agree that in no long Time a Peace was concluded by which  David  still enjoy'd  Carlisle  and his Son  Henry  the Earldom of  Huntington  for which he did Homage to King  Stephen  but his Father refused to do the same alledging that he had already given his Faith to the Empress  Matilda Eachard  Oct  th the King dy'd and was succeeded by  Hen  II    THIS King made at  Chester  a very Advantageous Treaty with  Malcolm  King of  Scotland  who yielded up to him  Carlisle Newcastle  upon  Tyne  and  Bamborough  Castle resting satisfied with the Earldom of  Huntington  which Prince  Henry  his Father had held  Paris Hovden  The Restitution of these Places says  Rapin  was doubtless no more than what was just since  David  Grandfather to  Malcolme  had caused them to be adjudg'd to him by Treaties at a Time when  Stephen  minded more his own private Interest than the pub∣lick Good of the Kingdom but in all Appearance  Henry  's great Power con∣tributed more than any Thing else to the bringing the King of  Scotland  to this Temper  AFTER these Things we meet with some Accounts of this Place for we are told that King  Henry  II confirm'd their Estates to them and ex∣empted them from Tolls and Duties It is therefore a Mistake in some who say the Town had no Privileges till the Reign of King  John  And besides in the third of King  John  's Reign which was above ten Years before the Town had a Charter from that King the Town had great Privileges for the Men of  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  as is mentioned in that Year in the great Roll of  Northumberland  paid Marks and Palfreys So having the Town in their Hands by the

Surties  Samps  de  Carleolo  William  de  Ogle  Walter  de  Cowgate  After King  Edward  had declared War against  Scotland  he advanced to  Newcastle  and made it the chief Rendezvous of his Forces  Rapin  The Story at large is this King  John  of  Scotland  having in Contempt of King  Edward  disseised  Magdulph  Earl of  Fife  and imprison'd him  Magdulph  complain'd to King  Edward  who order'd King  John  to appear before him but upon this Summons he appeared not Upon this the King sent out a second Writ ordering him to appear before him    Days after  Michaelmas  which was obey'd Being come before him he seem'd not so sensible of the King's Su∣periority as he had been before which was judged a Contempt and Disobedience and that three of his principal Castles in  Scotland  should be seized But before the Pronunciation of the Sentence He came before the King and his Council and made Supplication to the King with his own Mouth the King receiving this with the Advice of his Council and the Consent of  Magdulph  granted his Prayer and gave him Day untill his Parliament af∣ter Easter But that Parliament was not holden that Day however the Suit between the King of  Scots  and  Magdulph  was continued and prorogued to the next Parliament which was summoned to be holden at St  Ed∣mund  's  Bury  on the Feast of St  Martin  in the Winter in the year    The Day being come the King was present and  Magdulph  strenuously prosecuted his Plea But the King of  Scot∣land  instead of appearing in Person sent the Abbot of  Abirbrothock  and other Noblemen of that Kingdom with not only frivolous excuses but to demand Satisfaction of King  Edward  for many and great Injuries Oppressions and Grievances sustained by the  Scots  from his Subjects King  Edward  's Answer was That for certain Cau∣ses he was coming toward the  North Parts  and that the King of  Scots  should then have sufficient Recompence to his own Content And then appointed him a Day to meet him at  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  viz The st day of  March  next following and ordered the Abbot and those with him to give Notice to their King that he should then personally appear In the mean Time the King had certain Intelligence that the King of  Scots  with his Pre∣lates Earls Barons  c  had entred into a Confederacy with  France  so that the King of  England  upon this Account also toward the Time appointed prepared for his Journey to  Newcastle  and sent before him the Abbot of  Newminster  and  Wellebeck  to the King of  Scots  to give him Notice of the Adjournment and Time of his coming  On the st of  March  the King was at  Newcastle  and staid there many Days expecting the King of  Scots  he came not the King of  England  removed nearer to  Scotland  and came to  Bamburgh  where he also summon'd him and expected him He neither came nor sent to excuse himself but returned the Homage and Fealty for Himself and all his Kingdom to King  Edward  by an Instrument or Writing and defied him After this he summon'd him again but he would not appear nay instead of that they proceed to Arms enter  England  plunder burn waste kill and destroy wherever they come  To obviate these Insolencies and chastise them according to their Deserts King  Edward  entred  Scotland  on Wednesday in  Easter  Week besieged and took  Berwick Castle  with a great Slaughter of the  Scots  from thence he sent Part of his Army to reduce the Castle of  Dunbarr  lately revolted which was done by the Death and Destruction of a great many  Scots  Ten thousands  says my Author  seven Barons an hundred Knights and thirty one Esquires were taken in the Castle the Army coming to relieve it Twenty two thousand of them were slain From thence King  Edward  marched to  Edinburgh  which Castle he took in eight Days From thence he marched to  Sterlin  where the King of  Scots  and many of his great Men sent to beg his Mercy He order'd them to meet him some few Days after at  Brechin  where they submitted to his Mercy and Favour without making any Terms or Conditions whatever  This done King  Edward  caused the Stone used by the Kings of  Scotland  as a Throne to be brought to  West∣minster  appointed  John Warren  Earl of  Surrey  and  Sussex  Governour of  Scotland Hugh de Cressingham  Treasurer and  William Ormsby  Justiciary sent King  John Baliol  to the Tower of  London  where he

Confederacy to remove him from the King's Person and banish him the Kingdom The great Earl of  Lancaster  Son of Prince  Edmund  and Grandson of  Henry III  was chosen their General who by common Consent sent to the King then at  York  petitioning him either to deliver Earl  Gaveston  to them or oblige him to quit the Kingdom according to the Late Ordinances The King took small Notice of their Supplications left  York  and repaired to  Newcastle  where he continued for a considerable Space Upon which the Lords with what Forces they could raise march'd with all Speed towards  Newcastle  not that they would offer Injury or create Trouble to their Sovereign but only Earl  Gaveston  and judge him according to the Laws they made by common Agreement Upon their Approach the King and  Gaveston  immediately fled to  Tinmouth  and tho' tne Queen then great with Child with Flood of Tears begg'd of him not to leave her in that Place he without any Pity took Shipping and salt'd with his Favourite

for her Sake he should incut the King's Indignation  The Barons who had enter'd  Newcastle  the same Day the King went from thence had seized all that he and his Favourite had left there the Hurry wherein they went off not having given them leave to take any Thing with them In  Gaveston's  Baggage were sound a great many Jewels which for the most part belonged to the Crown and of which an exact Inventory was taken that an Account might be given of them hereafter They were accordingly restored to the King after  Gaveston  was beheaded  Rapin  It appears by several Records that there has been

William Acton  Jo  de  Durham  Robt Musgrave  Tho Fleaminge  David  King of  Scots  en∣ter'd  North∣umberland  exercising all Manner of Hostility and wasting and Ravaging all before him for about    Miles in length 'till he came to  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  which he resolved to Besiege and so sat down with all his Forces before it The Captain of the Castle was the Lord  John Nevil  of  Hornby  a Person of great Conduct and Bra∣very who resolving to give the young King of  Scotland  a Taste of the  English  Valour as soon as might be com∣manded    Lances to make a Sally very early next Morning These dashing suddenly with great Fury into the  Scottish  Hoast on that Part where the Earl of  Murray  was who as they say was chief General for the Time the King himself keeping private took the Earl himself naked in Bed dragg'd him away naked out of his Tent  and so having slain several of his Men and won much Booty they return'd all safe into the Town with great Joy and delivered the Earl of  Murray  Prisoner to their Captain The Earl was a chief Prince of the Blood in  Scotland  next of Quality to Prince  Robert Stuart  and the Earl of  Southerland  but for Valour and Conduct he yielded to None This daring Enterprize having alarmed the whole Camp the  Scots  ran like Madmen to the Barriers of the Town and began a fierce Assault which they continued a great while with much Pertinency But they gain'd little and lost much For there were many good Men of War within who defended themselves with much Resolution and Discretion so that the  Scots  were at last fain to leave off their attac and the Hopes of suddenly revenging their Dishonour in that Place Wherefore that bold and lucky Attempt of the Besieged being thus well back'd by a vigorous Defence was sufficient to persuade King  David  and his Council that to dally about  Newcastle  was dangerous whereupon about Noon they decamp'd and went for  Durham  Assoon as the Lord  Nevil  had seen for certain the Departure of the  Scots  he guess'd their Design Upon which he mounted a very swift Gelding and coasting wide of the  Scots  rode Post Day and Night 'till on the th Night he rode more than    Miles to  Chertsey  in  Surry  where at that Time King  Edward  lay to whom he exactly related all he knew of the  Scots  whereupon the  King  made all the Haste he could Northward  In the mean Time the  Scots  assaulted  Durham  with all the Fury imaginable for they were even stark mad for the former Affront they had received at  Newcastle  when they lost the Earl of  Murray  so dishonourably They rear'd their Engines to cast Stones and other Devices they had whereby to approach the Walls under the Shelter of certain Machines resembling the ancient  Testudo  of the  Romans  or the  Synospismus  of the  Greeks  and withall they had other Engines running upon Wheels wherein on Lofts as high as the  Walls  at least there were  CrossBows  and others who kept the Besieged from the Defences So that after the Assault had been continual∣ly renewed with all the Vigour imaginable and on the other Hand maintained with incredible Obstinacy for    or    Days the  Scots  entred the City by Force at which Time King  David  in revenge of all his Losses for so many years preceding especially being urged beyond his Nature by the importunate Instigations of his  French  Auxiliaries then with him commanded his Captains to put all to Fire and Sword There were Men Women and Children old and young Men of the Church as  Monks Priests Canons  and others holy and prophane all without Pity or Distinction put to Death neither  Churches Monasteries  nor  Shrines  no not that of St  Cuthbert  him∣self after it had reposed there for more than    years could reconcile the incens'd Mind of the Soldiers to Pi∣ty not so much as one Soul was left alive within the Place So implacable and unmerciful is the Sword of War when sharpen'd with unchristian Cruelty  Before the  Scottish  Army got back to its own Country the King of  England  was upon their Heels but there were certain  Noblemen  on both Parts who earnestly labour'd to compose the Matters between the two  Kings  which at last took such Effect that a Truce was concluded for two years  Barns Hist Ed III  p      Rich Galleway  William Acton  Tho Fleaminge  Jo    Robt Musgrave    Rob Shilvington  Robt Musgrave  Jo Woodman  Robt Halliwell  William  de

Opportunity to ravage the Borders of  England  and penetrated as far as  Durham  which he took sacked and burnt but the  English  coming short∣ly after to an Engagement with him he had the Mortification not only to lose the Day but also to be taken a Priso∣ner  Rapin  The  Scotch  King tho' he had two Spears hanging in his Body his Leg almost incurably wounded and his Sword beat out of his Hand disdaining Captivity provok'd the  English  by opprobrious Language to kill him and when  John Copeland  Governour of  Roxborough  Castle advised him to yield he struck him on the Fate with his Gauntlet so fiercely that he knock'd out two of his Teeth But however  Copeland  Conveyed him a∣way out of the Field a Prisoner Upon his refusing to deliver him up to the Queen who stayed at  Newcastle  during the Battle the King sent for him to  Calais  where he excus'd his Refusal so handsomely that the King sent him back with a Reward of  l  aYear in Land where he himself should chuse it near his own Dwelling and made him a Knight Banneret  Act Publ V p as quoted by  Tyndal Rapin  's Translator  This Battle is said by  Hollingshead  in his History of  Scotland  p    to have been sought  October  the th the year before  The following Letter I am obliged to Mr Alderman  REAY  of this Town for  SIR  PUrsuant to your Request and my Promise I've been with Mr  Harle  and have met with the Passage you mentioned relating to  Newcastle  in the th Page of the first Vol of  Ha  luyt's English Voya∣ges  c printed at  London  Fol by which it appears that the Town of  Newcastle  assisted K  Edw  III with Ships and Men against the  French  a most authentic and convincing Proof of the great Naval Strength of that Town in those Days  Another earlier Instance of its being a Town famous for Trade in  Edward  II  's  Time is to be found in p and of the said Vol where we meet with an Order of the King and Council for the Sta∣ple to be holden at a certain Place This Order relating to the Exportation of Wool is directed to the Collectors of Custom for Wool and Woolen Fells in the Port of  London  The Title of it runs thus  De Stapula tenenda in certo loco ordinatio Anno  Edwardi  secundi  and the Order itself thus  Rex col∣lectoribus custumae canarum pellium canutarum in portu  London  salutem  ending with these Words  Teste Rege apud  Doveram  decimo octavo die  Junii  per ipsum Regem consilium  and immediately after is subjoin'd as follows  Et postmodum per breve de privato sigillo eodem modo mandatum est collectoribus Custu∣mae praedictae in Portubus subscriptis videlicet  In Portu Villae  Southampton  In Portu Villae  Weymouth  In Portu Villae  Sancti Botolphi  In Portu Villae  Kingstone super Hull  In Portu Villae de  Novo Castro  In Portu Villae de magna  Iernemutha  In Portu Villae de  Lenne  In Portu Villae de  Gypwico  where you see  Newcastle  is number'd among the greatest PORTS of the Nation at that Time  It would be as fatiguing as 'tis unnecessary to transcribe at length the said Order which must there∣fore be omitted as well as the long Roll of the English Fleet contain'd in the and Pages of the said Book I shall only tell you that the Account of the Fleet is thus inscrib'd  The Roll of the huge Fleet of  Edward III  before  Calice  extant in the King's great Wardrobe in  London  whereby the wonderful Strength of  England  by Sea in those Days may appear  This List is divided into the South and North Fleet the Beginning and End of both which I'll give you in the Author's own Words  The  South  Fleet  The King's Ships  The King's Mariners  London Ships  London Mariners  c  Sum of the South Fleet Ships  Sum of the South Fleet Mariners  The  North  Fleet  Bamburgh Ships  Bamburgh Mariners  Newcastle Ships  Newcastle Mariners  c  Sum of the  North  Fleet Ships  Sum of the  North  Fleet Mariners  I cannot leave this List without observing to the great Honour of that loyal and brave Town that  Newcastle  is not exceeded in its Number of Ships by any one of all the Ports nam'd in the said En∣rolment of the North Fleet  Yarmouth  alone excepted And how can it possibly detract from the Glory of  Newcastle  to be then outdone by  Yarmouth  when which is very surprizing that same great  Yar∣mouth  in  Norfolk  fitted out a vastly greater Number both of Men and Ships than  London  itself the great Metropolis of the Kingdom furnish'd his Grace with for the memorable Siege of  Calais  where he I mean King  Edward  III and his Son the Black Prince acquir'd such Renown to the English as will render themselves and the English Nation famous to succeeding Ages  There is one Thing more I must take Notice of before I conclude which is that the aforemention∣ed Fleet Roll has no Date I think it was about the Year when the English laid Siege to Calais tho' I can't certainly tell not having an English History by me at present This is all I can find upon a cursory View of the Book that has any Relation to  Newcastle  begging Leave in the mean Time to subscribe myself  SIR  Your very much oblig'd Humble Servant  JOHN WILSON  Alnwick  Dec    An' Christi  Mayors  Bailiffs    Peter Graper

Prior of  Durham  against the Mayor and Bailiffs of  Newcastle  for the yearly Rent of the House of  Farneland  AN Assise taken at  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  before  Thomas  de  Fencotes Thomas  de  Seton  and  Roger  de  Blaykeston  Justices of our Lord the King at the Assises to be held in the County of  Northumberland  as∣signed on Wednesday in the third Week of  Lent  in the twenty fifth year of the Reign of King  Edward  in  Eng∣land  the Third from the Conquest and the twelfth of his Reign in  France  by virtue of a certain Commission di∣rected to them and  William Bassep  the Presence of the said  William  not being expected by virtue of a certain Brief of our Lord the King But of not all  c  The Assises came to consider and know if  Peter Graper  Mayor of the Town of  Newcastle  upon  Tyne John  de  Emeldon Hugh  de  Angerton Hugh  de  Carlel  and  William  de  Acton  Bailiffs of the said Town of  New∣castle  had unjustly disseised  John  Prior of  Durham  from his free Tenement in the said Town of  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  after Possession  c  And it is enquired why they disseised him from thirteen Marks and ten Shillings the Rent with the Appurtenances  c  And  Peter  and the others did not come And the Sheriff declared that the foresaid  Hugh  de  Angerton  and  Hugh  de  Carlel  are dead And the foresaid  Peter  is attached by  Henry Glassen Wright  and  Thomas  de  Newbigging  and the foresaid  John  de  Emeldon  by  Thomas  de  Newbigging  and  Thomas Stele  and the foresaid  Wiliam  by  Thomas  de  Newbigging  and  Henry Glassen Wright  Therefore they are in Mercy and let the aforesaid Assise be taken against them by Default  c  And upon this the aforesaid Prior by his Attorney says That our Lord the King now reigning by his Charter because he heard from the Testimony of those whom he credits That our Lord  Edward  lately King of  England  his Father had in his Life by Word of Mouth granted to the Monks dwelling in the Island of  Farneland  near  Bamburgh  which Island is a Cell of the Priory of  Durham  ten Quarters of Corn and two Tuns of Wine to be received every Year by the Hands of the Mayor and Bailiffs of  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  as an Alms of his said Fa∣ther for ever And that this Grant was not duly put in Execution in the Lifetime of his said Father nor con∣firmed by any of his Letters Our present Lord the King for the Health of the Soul of his Father being willing to fulfil and continue his Will in this Part hath granted to the aforesaid Monks as a Compensation of the afore∣said Corn and Wine thirteen Marks and ten Shillings to be received every year at the Feast of St  Michael  by the Hands of the Mayor and Bailiffs of the said Town of  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  then being from the Fee of the said Town namely Five Marks for every Tun of Wine and five Shillings for every Quarter of Corn to be paid to the said Monks and their Successors dwelling in the foresaid Island as his Alms for ever and he produces in Court the foresaid Charter of our present Lord the King which testifies this  c  And he prays Assise Let an Assise therefore be taken  c  By a Recognition of the aforesaid Assise they say upon their Oath that the aforesaid Prior was seised of the foresaid Rent with the Appurtenances 'till the foresaid  Peter  and others disseised him to the Loss of the said Prior forty one Pounds thirteen Shillings and four Pence It follows therefore that the aforesaid Prior may thence re∣cover his Seisine against those by a Sight of the Recognition of the Assise aforesaid and his Losses aforesaid and the said  Peter  and others are in the Injury And let not the Sheriff be omitted because of the Liberty of the afore∣said Town because that otherwise  c  An' Christi  Mayors  Bailiffs    Gilbert Duxfield

thereof was in the King's Pleasure and the Compass of it being so large extending to so many Shires so far distant that it could not be sufficiently served by one Bishop and the King being willing to have two Bishopricks for that Diocese the one at  Durham  which should have    Marks Revenue and another at  Newcastle  which should have    MarksRevenue and also to found a Cathedral Church at  Newcastle  with a Deanry and Chapter out of the Revenues of the said Bishoprick Therefore the Bishoprick is utterly extinguished and dissolved and Authority given by Letters Patents to erect the two

transcribe from  Scrype  's Life of Archbishop  Parker  pag    and    In this Year came one of these Dissenting Preachers in Appearance but in Truth a  Dominican  Friar to  Maidstone  to the  Maidenhead  Inn there with divers others his Followers where as Guests they bespa e a Dinner Divers others resorted hither enquiring for this Man whose Name was  Faithful Cummin  These were his Congregation Being thus met in the Room they had taken up  Cummin  exercised extemporary Prayer for about two Hours groaning and weeping much The Exercise being over most of the Company departed some few carried and partook with the Exerciser of the Dinner provided  Of this Meeting  John Clarkson  the Archbishop's Chaplain being informed acquainted his Grace and be the Queen and Council Before whom at length this Man was convened the next Year as a Sower of Sedition among the Queen's Subjects Here the Archbishop examined him he acknowledged he was ordained by Cardi∣nal  Pole  but said that he was fallen off from  Rome  and that he was a Preacher of the Gospel but that he had no Licence to preach from any of the Bishops since the Reformation And when the Archbishop asked him if he had no such Licence how any could be assured that he was not of the  Romish  Church He would prove that by his Prayers and Sermons wherein he had spoken against  Rome  and the  Pope  as much as any of the Clergy And he pretented that it was Licence enough to preach to have the Spirit which he said he had When the Archbishop again demanded whether that could be the Spirit that complied not with the Or∣ders  of the Church lately purged and cleansed from Idolatry He replied he endeavoured to make the Church purer than it was This Man had a Congregation that followed him which he termed Men of tender Con∣sciences And with them he prayed and preached and administred the Sacrament When he preached in pub∣lick he would be absent till the Divine Service were over for the  English  Liturgy he could not away with and then he could come into the Church and preach  After his former Examination and giving Bail for his farther Appearance he found Opportunity to escape beyond Sea telling his Congregation that he was warned of God to travel abroad to instruct Protestants in the other Parts of the World and would come again to them Leaving these as his last Words to them That spiritual Prayer was the chief Testimony of a true Protestant and that the Set Form of Prayer was but the Mass translated and so praying with them and getting Money from them to bear his Expences in many Tears he parted from them and was afterwards seen in the  Low Countries  went to  Rome  and upon de∣claring his Services to the Pope who after commending him gave him a Reward of Two Thousand Ducati  This

several Questions  viz  Whether the Pope be Judge  in Spiri∣tualibus  over his Majesty and whether  in Temporalibus  if it be in  Ordine ad Spiritualia  Whereto he answers in Writing to the first Part affirmatively  in Spiritualibus  but whether  in Temporalibus  he is not obliged to answer to any but a Judge of Controversies in Religion the Pope or one of his Authority    Whether the Pope has a Power to depose Kings after their Excommunication and in particular his Majesty To this he answer'd He will not declare but to a lawful Judge of Religion    Whether the Pope hath Power to excommunicate Kings such as are not of his Church as his Majesty To this he answer'd affirmatively and that all People baptiz'd are under the Pope's Power    Whether it be no Murder to kill the King so deposed    Whether he hath Power to assoil Subjects from the Oath of their Allegiance to his Majesty To these he answers  ut supra  He railed at the Oath of Allegiance as damnable and treasonable against God so became unworthy of Mercy and order'd to prepare for his Trial and the Evening before it began was told that he was not to be tried for any thing relating to his Religion but for his former Answers to the Questions which he may recal and crave Mercy This he utterly refused Upon his Trial he protests not to acknowledge the Judges nor Judgment lawful The King to have no Authority but derivative from his Predecessors who acknowledged the Pope's Jurisdiction If the King will be to me as they were to mine he shall be my King if otherwise I value him not And that I repent only for not having been so busy as I should in that which you call perverting of Subjects and I call saving of Souls I do decline the King's Authority and will do it still in Matters of Religion most of your Ministers maintain it and if they be wise will continue in that Mind His insolent Speech was shortned by the Jurors quick Return who found him guilty and he had Sentence of Treason and to stop his Raillery he was after Noon the same Day hanged at  Glasgow  He was a desperate second  Ravillae  and ready in that Devilish Doctrine of Deposing and Dethroning Kings which he urged the more he said as consonant to the Kir  Ministers Tenets and that nothing troubled him but to be taken away 'ere he had done That which all  Scotland  and  England  should not have prevented and had it been performed

to his Castle at  Stockton  and thence into the  South  Dr  Balcanqual  their Countryman the Dean made haste to secure himself the  Scots  threatning to treat him as an Incendiary for Penning the King's large Declara∣tion The next Day the  Scots  were attended by Commissiners from  Newcastle  Sir  Jacob Ashley  their Gover∣nor judging the Town not tenable and sinking his Ordinance in the River thought fit to desert it to treat for the Surrender of that important Town On  Sunday  the th of August the  Scotch  Army enter'd  Newcastle  where they took Possession of the King's Magazines of Arms Ammunitions and Victuals and an Opportunity of enlarging Mr  Colvil  who had been sent by the Covenanters into  France  with Letters to the  French  King and Cardinal  Richlieu  The same Day Mr  Henderson  preach'd in St  Nicholas  Church and after Sermon the Ge∣neral and Nobility was treated by the Mayor The Earl of  Lothian  was made Governor of the Place with a Garrison of    Men Which Trust they thought he well deserved such was his Zeal to the Cause that tho' both his Father and himself owed all their Wealth and Greatness to the King's Bounty yet he was one of the first that engaged against him At the same Time a more dismal Fate attended the Lord  Haddington  who having a vowedly fallen from the King's Side and listed under  Lesley  was left at home with his Regiment to attend the Motions of the Garrison of  Berwick  For that purpose he kept his Quarters at  Dunglass  where standing at Noonday in the Courtyard with about sixty Gentlemen the Castle having a Magazine of Powder which sud∣denly taking Fire was blown up and in a Moment buried him and all his Company so that they were never more seen This Tragical Event being reported at Court the Royalists were not so moderate in their Consures as the King himself who only said that he had been very ungrateful to him yet he was sorry he had not Time to repent  Under these discouraging Circumstances the Earl of  Strafford  met the  English  Army at  Durham  where he highly blamed the Lord  Conway  for the late  Dishonour  After that he found it necessary to retire to the skirts of  Yorkshire  leaving all  Northumberland  and the Bishoprick of  Durham  to the Pleasure of the Conquerors who besides Provisions of Coals and Forage sessed these Parts at a Contribution of  l per  Day that is  l  to be paid

Country which cost the Town a vast Sum of Money for they continued too long a Time before the People were rightly safed of them Besides the  l  a Day they seized the Rents of the Bishop Dean and Chapter and Papists as Enemies to their Designs and  Lesley  suffered his Soldiers to rifle and break open Shops and Houses and likewise seized on four great  English  Ships laden with Corn as lawful

Upon which Master Treasurer made a Report that there as an Arrear to the  Scots  of  l  besides the  l  In the Afternoon the Commons voted it and it was confirm'd by the Lords that both Ar∣mies should be satisfied and disbanded by the second of the next Month  June  There was a great Debate about the Payment of the  l  allowed the  Scots  at length it was concluded that they should have  l  of it paid at  Michaelmas  come Twelvemonths and the other  l  at  Midsummer  Twoyears after  June  It was voted that eight of the Lords and six of the Commons should be appointed as Commissioners to pay the  Scots  the Money of Assistance allowed them  July  At a Conference betwixt both Houses there was a Debate about disbanding the Armies and it was concluded on that there should be  l  presently sent down for the disbanding the  English  Army and the  Scots  to have  l  to disband theirs to be paid by the Earl of  Warwick  August  At a Conference the Lord  Lowdon  made a Report from the rest of the Lords in  Scotland  that they had ac∣cepted the Articles of Pacification with much Thankfulness and had agreed for the speedy disbanding of their Army and given Publick Faith upon it  August  There came Letters this Day of the  Scots  marching away and that his Majesty had prevailed with the Par∣liament of  Scotland  that their Ordnance and Ammunition should be left at  Newcastle  to be conveyed to  London    Sir  John Marley  Kt  Henry Maddison  In this Year just before the breaking out of the Civil Wars King  Charles I  ordered the Earl of  Newcastle William Cavendish  to securce the Town of  Newcastle  which was done tho' with much Difficulty and then he caused  Tinmouth  Castle to be seized also  Rapin  In this Year also  Leonard Carr  Esq  an Alderman of this Place had the following Articles exhibited against him by the CommonWealth to each of which my Authority has made a marginal Remark which take as follows  I  He the said  Leonard Carr  joined with Sir  John Marley  and others  This first Article is really true that he and about thirty more raised  l  amongst them but they could not get one Man to prove it  in  Newcastle  in lending Money to the late King  Charles  after he had left and deserted the Parliament in the Year  II  The said Mr  Carr  joined with Sir  John  Marley and other Alder∣men  The Truth of his Article may appear under his Hand in the CommonCouncil Chamber  in disposing of  l  out of the Town's Treasury which was lent and sent to the King accordingly at his first raising War against the Parliament  III  He the said Mr  Carr  did join with Sir  John Marley  in laying an Imposition of Threepence upon every Ch  ldron of Goals  This Article also may be proved his Hand in the Towns's Books at this Day  for maintaining of the Garrison of  Newcastle  and for satisfying of the Sums of Money taken up by Sir  John Marley  and others for the Maintenance of the War against the Parliament  IV  The said Mr  Carr  being Governor of the Merchants Company  This may be proved under his Hand in the Merchants Company's Books  The severall Subscriptions were shown to the Committee appointed by the Council  acquainted them with the King's great Want of Money and pressed them to a Contribution and thereupon a considerable Sum of Mo∣ney was raised and sent away to his Majesty  V  He the said Mr  Carr  was appointed by Sir  John Marley  and others  This is known to all the Town and Country  as chief Surveyor for the building of a Fort in  Newcastle  against the Parliament's Forces which he performed so well that for his Merit they call'd it by his Name  CARR's BATTERY  VI  He the said Mr  Carr  did  This is certainly true and I can give Oath of it the Writing being his own Hand  by a Writing under his own Hand which was found at the Storming of  Newcastle  among the Go∣vernor's Papers subscribe the Earl of  Essex  and the Parliament of  England  Traytors for taking up Arms against the King  VII  He the said Mr  Carr  upon the Parliament's Forces approaching  Newcastle  This will be proved upon Oath by the Persons who owed the Houses Informations being given in already  caused to be pulled down some Houses in a Place called  Sandgate  to the utter undoing of the poor Inhabitants  VIII  The said Mr  Carr  did join with Sir  John Marley  and others  This Mr  Carr  confess'd before Ma∣jorGeneral  Hammond  and I saw his Hand to a peremptory Letter  in writing a Letter to General  Lesley  and the  English  Commissioners positively refusing to deliver up the Town when they in the Par∣liament's Name and for their Use made Demand thereof in Writing  IX  And further  The Answer he gave himself before his Highness's Council to these Articles I have seen Courage failed him in the day of Battle he was like Man sinking who will catch at the smallest sinking Reed to save his life However set aside a Frailty too common still be looked upon as a Lover of his King and Country  he the said Mr  Carr  was summoned before the Committee for Sequestration for his Delinquency where he was upon his Examination of the Articles against him declared a Delin∣quent and since that Time before the Committee confessed him∣self a Delinquent and craved the honourable Respects to him  This Year in  July  the Lord  Grey  of  Wark  and others were sent by the Parliament to invite the  Scots  once more to invade  England  who the following Month sent the Solemn League and Covenant to them which was readily read in Parliament and taken by the House of Commons  Sept  in St  Margaret  's and  Oct  by the Lords in  WestminsterAbbey  A sit Prelude to their sanctify'd Reformation and a proper Imitation of that at  Munster    The same  Cuthbert Carr    The same  Henry Warmouth  James Cole  Robert Ellison  On the th of  January  this year in a dismal snowy Season the  Scots  contrary to all Faith and Loyalty passed the River  Tweed  at  Berwick  ac∣company'd by a select Committee of their own and there met another from  England  who were to conduct and supply them in the most loving Manner Upon their Conjunction was framed the General Committee of both Kingdoms and in Effect became a united CampParliament Before the Advance of the Army by a Trumpeter they sent a Letter to Sir  Thomas Glenham  and the rest of the Commanders and Gentlemen of  Northumber∣land  at  Alnwick  in which they insisted upon the Solemn League and Covenant and declared their wellweighed Resolutions to prevent that imminent Danger not only of Corruption but of Ruin which they saw evidently in∣tended to the true Protestant Religion by the Popish and Prelatical Faction and to rescue his Majesty's Person and Honour from the Counsels of those whose Ends are little better than Popery and Tyranny Therefore they expected the Concurrence of them and all others and if they met with any Opposition the Law of Nature and their own Reason would tell them what they are to expect With this Letter they sent also a Copy of the  Scotch  Declaration to give it the greater Force and Authority among the Vulgar  The brave Sir  Thomas Glenham  after a serious Consultation with the Officers and Gentry how most to in∣commode the Enemy's March returned a sharp Answer in which he and the rest declare That without the Sight of that Letter they could not have believed that the  Scottish  Nation or the present prevailing Party in that Nation would have attempted an Invasion of  England  so contrary to the Laws of God of Nations and of both Kingdoms but especially to the late Act of Pacification so opposite to their Allegiance and Gratitude to his Ma∣jesty to that neighbourly Love they pretend to that discreet Care they should have of their own Safety They declare that no Order of Committees whatsoever of Men or Angels could give Power to make War against their natural Sovereign upon the empty Pretence of nameless evil Counsellors and for the  English  Agents they could not believe them any Commissioners lawfully authorized by the Two Houses of Parliament or yet by the House of Commons whence so many Members were expell'd by partial Voting so many banished by seditious Tumults so many voluntarily absent out of Conscience where Desperation Want of Opportunity to depart or Fear of certain Plunder were the chief Bonds which held the little Remnant together from Dissipation where the venerable Name of  Parliament  was made a State to countenance the pernicious Counsels and Acts of a close Committee  As to the  Scots  they declare that no Covenant whatsoever could justify such Proceedings begun without any Necessity or so much as Provocation After answering their Pretensions they desire them to consider that there must be an Account given to God of all the Blood which should be shed in this Quarrel And since their Insults  were such that a vanquished Nation could scarce endure from their Conquerors they could not think they were grown so same as to desert ther Religion Laws Liberties and Estates upon Command of Foreigners and to suffer themselves to be made Beggars and Slaves without Opposition  These PaperSkirmishes had no other Effect than to gain some little Time for Sir  Thomas Glenham  to draw his Forces and Artillery to  Newcastle  for  Alnwick  was not tenable besides he found several of the Gentlemen of  Northumberland  especially such as were allied to the Lord  Grey  of  Wark  either for fear of the  Scotch  or Affection to their Cause were very backward in opposing the Enemy The  Scotch  marched after him by slow and difficult Marches by Reason of the Snow and Floods and on the d of  February  summoned the Town of  Newcastle  but finding they were not able to take the Place after three Weeks Stay and some Skirmishes they passed the River  Tyne  on the th of  February  and on the th of  March  entred  Sunderland  The Marquis of  Newcastle  Ge∣neral for the King in these  Northern  Parts having reinforced his Army to about    Horse and Foot attended so near the  Scotch  Army and so intercepted their Supplies that sometimes they had neither Meat nor Drink and were never possessed of above twentyfour Hours Provision but they coloured over their necessity by keeping a so∣lemn Fast and pressing on towards  Durham  for better Quarters to stop their advancing on the Twentythird of  March  the Marquis drew up his Army at  Hilton  on the  North  of the River  Were  the  Scots  were drawn up on  Whitburn Lizard  a Hill  East  from them adjoining to the Sea So the Armies faced each other and skir∣mished in Parties the FieldWord given by the Marquis being prophetically enough  Now or Never  and by the  Scots  in their assuming Way  The Lord of Hosts is with us  The Marquis not being able to force the  Scots  to a Battle retreated towards his Quarters at  Durham  and the  Scots  followed slowly but could make no conside∣rable Advance till the Lord  Fairfax  and the rest of the Parliament Forces by a new Diversion gave them Op∣portunity to descend into  Yorkshire Echard  In the same Year after the City of  York  had surrender'd to the Parliament the three Armies thought sit to separate the  Scottish  Army was order'd to march  Northwards  and joining with the Earl of  Calander  who had enter'd  England  with  Scots  laid Siege to  Newcastle  on the th of  August  the Siege lasted above two Months and proved one of the most resolute in the Kingdom all Sorts of Policy of Peace and War by Treaty by Mines by Assaults having been used to little Effect the Inhabitants resolving if possible never to fall into the Hands of the  Scots  But on  Saturday  the th of  October  the whole  Scotch  Army furiously set upon the Town and having made three Breaches after a tedious and bloody Storm they at last master'd it Sir  John Marley  Sir  Nicholas Cole  and Sir  George Barker  got into the Castle where being forced by Necessity they came to a Capitulation and surrender'd on the th of the same Month The Town being taken by Assault was sufficiently plunder'd but the Surrendry proved of great Importance to the City of  London  where the poorer Sort of People for the two last Years were almost starved for want of Fewel Coals having been risen to the Price of  l  a Chaldron a Price never known before that Time  Echard  In this Year the round Tower under the  MootHall  towards the  SandHill  called the  HalfMoon  which was the old Castle of  Monkchester  was by Sir  John Marley  made use of to secure the River and Keyside against the  Scots  and the other Castle he put into good Repair which was very ruinous On the former he laid great Guns for the Use abovementioned and on the latter he laid great Ordnance to beat off those Guns which the  Scots  had laid upon the Banks of  Gateshead  against the Town And this he managed bravely for a long time for the  Scots  began the siege about  July  and it was the th of  October  before they could take it which they did by Storm upon the Day after St  Luke  's Day and it was  by the  White Fryer Tower  and  Sand∣gate  where the Colliers of  Elswick  and  Benwell  were employed under one  John Osbourn  a false rebellious  Scot  to undermine the Walls which they did and blew them up and so got and plunder'd the Town And no marvel for they were accounted    Men and the Townsmen were but in all    Men wearied with continual Watch and Duty tho' Men of great Courage and sought it gallantly to the last for the  Newgate  Ward which was under Capt  Cuthbert Carr  was taken by the Enemy who entered at the asoresaid Places and en∣compassed them before and behind and  Pilgrimstreet  Gate was maintained by Capt  George Errington  Lieu∣tenant  William Robson  and Ensign  Thomas Swan  who sought and killed very many they themselves not having one hurt until they were encompassed by the Enemy before and behind And even then they would not parley with the  Scots  who fought against them without but did capitulate with LieutenantColonel  Sinclair  who loved and honoured them and kept his Agreement so well with them that not one of them was robbed of his Cloaths or Money nor were any of his Men suffered to give any evil Word and it was the great Blessing of God that in all that Time there was not one Man slain nor hurt altho' that Company consisted of Ninescore Men all TradesMen and there were divers Sallies made out at that Gate for it was the longest of all the Gates of the Town it being barrocaded and shut up And after they had surrender'd and the Enemy was called over at that Breach they durst not approach but shot at their Friends that called them and would not believe that the Town was taken MS  Milbank  It is not improper to place here the Lord  Hume  's Relation of the Conclusion of this Siege in his Letter to the Lord Chancellor of  Scotland  with the rest of the Commissioners at  London  Right Honourable  I Should have gone into  Newcastle  on  Thursday  but was put off till  Friday  by these obstinate Miscreants especially the Mayor of that Town Sir  David Hume John Rutherford  and I my self went in on  Friday  at Nine in the Morning we had Commission from General  Lesley  and Committees if we found real Dealings to yield to honourable Conditions  The Mayor Sir  Nicholas Cole  and Sir  George Baker  were treating with us they gave us big Words do what we could they would not so much as come to speak of Conditions of rendring up the Town and after three or four Hours Debate all that we could draw from them was that they would think upon our Propositions and return them within three or four Days and that when all Conditions were agreed upon they would give Hostages to surrender in case Relief came not in twenty Days nor would they so much as write to the General their own Propositions So that after our Return we sent to the Town these Conditions forthwith to be accepted  That all Officers should have Liberty to stay or to march out in all Honour with Arms Bagg and Baggage to any Garrison with a Convoy within sixty Miles and all others not Soldiers shall have the like Li∣berty The Town to enjoy all their former Liberties and Charter with all manner of Protection to the In∣habitants from Plunder Freedom as any Town subject to the Parliament No free Billeting imposed  None to enter the Town but only a competent Garrison signed by the General with this Caveat that they should send out Hostages by Eight of the Clock the next Morning for Surrender of the Town before  Monday  the    of  October  Instead of which they sent out to us a bitter Invective Letter tho' they knew all our Batteries and Mines were ready yet they boldly drew from us these Enforcements Therefore this Morning the  Scots  make three Breaches and to spring four Mines and so to fall on The Breaches were made reasonable low before Three a Clock Afternoon All Mines played well and yet the Town stood out obstinate My Lord Chancellour's Regiment and  Backelough  's enter'd a Breach at  Closegate  The General of the Artillery his Regiment and that other of  Edinburgh  's enter'd at Nine under the  White Tower  Col  Stuart  's and  Gask  's Regiments enter'd at a Mine but with hot Dispute at  Westgate  this was our Quarter LieutenantGeneral  Bally  had another Quarter at  Newgate  with five Regiments his own  Waughton  's  Cowper  's  Dunferling  's and  Dudhop  's who enter'd by a Breach many of our Officers kill'd Major  Robert Hepburn  much lamented  Castles Kelhead Wedderburn Marshall  and the Master of  Yesters  they had the third Quarter  Sinclaire Alton Niddery  the Master of  Cranston  and the Lord  Niddery  had the fourth Quarter who enter'd at two Mines They within made their utmost Opposition with great Execution on us but we forced them and the Mayor with others Gentlemen of Quality got to the Castle More you shall have within a Day or two  October    Your Lordship's Humble Servant  A HUME  And presently upon this Letter Thanksgiving was made at  London  with hearty Thanks to God for his great Mercy in giving up the Town of  NewCastle  in  England  to our Brethren of  Scotland  and the th  October  the Castle likewise surrendered with three hundred Persons the Lords  Crawford Rea  and  Maxwell  were sent to  Edinburgh  to be executed and the Town being taken by a great Slaughter was plundered to the full and the  Scots  excused themselves that therein the Parliament of  England  would be the better pleased Thus was the Town taken from the King after an obstinate and gallant Defence and well may assume the Motto Be∣stowed upon it  FORTITER DEFENDENDO TRIUMPHANS  Newcastle  the th of  Nov  The  COMMITTEE  'S  DECLARATION  THE Committees of both Kingdoms after many Meetings and serious Debates amongst themselves and the hearing of sundry Persons well experienced in the Collieries and CoalWorks about the Town of  Newcastle  and having taken into their serious Consideration sundry Propositions for the Good of those Works and the driving on of that Trade for the Benefit of the Parliament and the Pay of the Army have at length concluded and agreed amongst themselves that some of the most notorious Delinquents and Ma∣lignants late CoalOwners in the Town of  Newcastle  should be wholly excluded from intermeddling with any Shares or Parts of Collieries or Interest in any Coals whatsomever that formerly they have laid Claim unto and that the rest of the said Delinquents deserve not to have any Benefit of the said Coals or Col∣lieries But in regard the Delinquents and Malignants belonging to those Collieries were very many in Number they did not conceive it for the Service of the Parliament or the Army to put them all out at once and so to hazard the retarding of the present setting on of the Works and ruining of the same in regard they were furnished with Materials and Utensils and had Things ready at hand and did best know where to find Workmen which Strangers would have had Difficulty to find and could not possibly on the sudden sufficiently provide themselves to set on the Works and having made Trial to lett some Delin∣quents Collieries and for this Purpose having treated with some wellaffected Persons what Profit might be raised and how they might be lett for the most Benefit to the Parliament were constrain'd for the present rather to make Use of those Delinquents in working their own Collieries as Tenants and Servants to the Parliament than to engage our Friends upon Incertainties and hazard their Loss as our own Hindrance in setting forward the Works for the Use and Benefit of the Parliament Wherefore the Com∣mittees of both Kingdoms seeing the Necessity of dispatching away the Ships that every Day call upon us for their Lading and lie at Charges in Expectation of getting Coals for their Money have thought fit to make the following Declaration to all but such as are expected as beforementioned and whose Names are hereafter written  st  That for the present Time there be allowed on the behalf of the rest of the late CoalOwners  s  Sterling upon every Chaldron of ShipCoals for desraying the Charges in the Works underground Carri∣age thereof to the Staiths and from thence in Keels to the Ships paying the TownDues as was formerly paid  viz d  for the Town and  d  for the Garrison  per  Chalder and the usual and accustomed Rents for the Pits and as a competent Consideration for the Support of the said late Owners themselves and this Allowance is made as well for the Coals at the Staiths and Pits ready wrought as those to be wrought the said Owners Collieries and Workmen being always obliged to set on Foot with all Dili∣gence and maintain their CoalWorks make ready their Keels and all other Necessaries sit for the same and the CoalWorkers who are to receive the Benefit of Payment as abovesaid for their Work out of the Coals already above ground are obliged to continue in working the said Coals at the ordinary Rate and Conditions as was formerly accustomed And whatsoover more Price the said Chalders of Coals being sold to Merchants or Masters of ships shall yield above the said  s per  Chalder together with what Custom and impost is or shall be put upon the same and the old Custom of  s  upon the Chalder for∣merly paid by the Owners to his Majesty to be employed for the Pay and Maintenance of the Army upon Account to the Parliament of  England  or their Committes  dly  That the Coals already wrought aboveground either at Pits or Staiths Belonging to Friends have like Allowance of  s  upon the Chalder they paying the said Town's Duties  viz d  to the Town  and  d  to the Garrison  per  Chalder And the Surplus of the Price which they shall yield  eing sold to Merchants or Ship Masters to be employed for the said public Use by Way of Loan and that they have the publick Faith for the same The Owners Taxmen and Workers being always tied to put on Foot and maintain the said Works remitting to the Determination of the Parliament what other Con∣ditions they will be pleased to grant them for the Coals henceforth to be wrought  dly  It is thought fit that the Price of Coals be  s per  Chalder with the Assess of  s  upon the Chal∣der and the ancient  d  to the King is  s  for every Chalder to Merchant or Skipper for all Coals vended in this Port of  Newcastle  and for those exported to pay the same Rate and such further Cus∣tom as is ordained by the Book of CustomRates  thly  That Certification be made to the several Owners of which we doubt not our Friends will take spe∣cial Notice and instantly apply themselves to set on their Works that if presently they use not all possible Diligence in getting on Foot their several CoalWorks and in maintaining thereof in that Case to be de∣clared uncapable of any future Benefit which they might expect out of their said Collieries and that other Persons shall be employed forworking the same for the publick Use and Benefit of the Parliament and Army  The Parties Names excepted out of this Declaration and Agreement as beforementioned  Sir  JOHN MARLEY  Knight  Sir  THOMAS RIDDELL  Knight  Sir

Christopher Nicholson    Henry Dawson  Henry Rawling  In this year when King  Charles I  by his ill Success was reduced to the lowest Ebb he upon some Assurances of Protection from the  Scots  then besieging  Newark  repaired to their Army and immediately gave Orders to the Lord  Bellasis  to sur∣render  Newark  which might have held out several Months longer which done the  Scots  Army before they could have received any Orders from the Parliament with uncommon Expedition marched with him to  New∣castle  where they arrived May the  th  About the Middle of  July  the Parliament sent their Commissioners the Earls of  Pembroke  and  Suffolk  of the Peers and Sir  Walter Earl  Sir  John Hippisley Robert Goodwin  and  Luke Robinson  Esqrs for the Commons with    Propositions for his Majesty to assent to  See  Rushworth Demands of such a horrid and destructive Nature as would if granted have render'd the King and his Me∣mory inglorious and despicable both at home and abroad The King perceiving all Things tending to his Ruin he seemed to hearken most to his old false Friend  William Murray  of the BedChamber who privately proposed an Escape and offered to make his Way and to have a ship in Readiness to transport his Majesty beyond Sea The Project appeared plausible and the King had disguised himself for it but was discovered in the Attempt Whether he was faithful to his Majesty in this Point is uncertain since Sir  Robert Murray  was concerned in it but Bishop  Guthry  says it was divulged before the set Time so that there was no Discourse throughout the Army but of  Murray  's Plot to carry away the King Thereupon a Guard of Soldiers was immediately planted at his Cham∣ber Door both within and without by which his Majesty was not only deprived of Liberty but also of Quiet and Retirement and having an Antipathy against Tobacco was much disturbed by their bold and continual smoaking in his Presence A military Presage of the same heathenish Barbarity at going to the Block before  Whitehall  Upon his Majesty's Entry into  Newcastle  he was caressed with Bonfires and Ringing of Bells Drums and Trumpets and Peals of Ordnance but guarded by    of the  Scottish  Horse these near him bareheaded He lodged at General  Levin  's Quarters who proclaims that Papists or Delinquents should not come near his Person  And that altho' his Majesty was present yet all Men whatsoever should yield Obedience to the Ordinance of Parliament  The  Scotch  Army are now they imagine Masters of all by their Power of the King's Person and levy into∣lerable Taxes and Assessments upon all  Northern  Counties which very coursely resent them and complain to the Parliament at  Westminsters  not without some Rising of the People standing upon their Guard And all the  Scotch  Hors formerly sent into  Scotland  are return'd into  Yorkshire  which makes the House of Common debate and vote That this Kingdom had no further Need of the Army of our Brethren the  Scots  in this Kingdom and that the Sum of  l  should be advanced and paid to that Army as followeth  viz l  thereof after their surrendring of  Newcastle Carlisle  and other  English  Garrisons possessed by them in  England  and the other  l  after they are advanced into  Scotland  and Order shall be taken for Payment of their Arrears  And forthwith Mr  Alexander Henderson  the  Scots  Apostolick Minister and one of their Commissioners was sent from  Westminster  to  Newcastle  to dispute with the King and to convince him to the Covenant where after several Discourse and Meetings the King is pleased to descend so low as to argue Reasons by Wri∣tings which continued several Encounters by Papers till the th of  July  concerning ChurchMatters by Auth  rity of the Fathers and Practice of the Church which  Henderson  would avoid by Texts of  Scripture  and from thence his own Opinion should guide him beyond all universal Consent or Practice of the Primitive Church which were erroneous which was not contradicted by orthodox learned Men in the Times of the first Practice as is easily percieved That these Desections were some of them justly called Rebellions which  Henderson  mentions And lastly that alleit he never esteem'd any Authority equal to the Scripture yet he thanks the numerous Con∣sent of the Fathers and the universal Practice of the Primitive Church to be the best and Authentical Inter∣preters of God's Word and consequently the purest Judges between him and  Henderson  until better may be sound  as for Example he says  I think Mr  Henderson  the best Preacher in  Newcastle  yet I believe you may err and possibly a better Preacher may come but till then I must retain my Opinion  CR  These Disputes are in Print which shews his Majesty's Temper and Knowledge to treat so long with a peevish Presbyter  Only the King was rid of one troublesome Guest Mr  Henderson  who had been disputed into so much Reason and Understanding that being convinced by the King he fell into some Distemper at  Newcastle  and therefore was sent home to  Scotland  where he died perfectly reconciled to the King's Affairs and an Apostate from the  Scots  Army and their Proceedings  Sanderson's  Hist of K  Charles I p  The King gives Earnest of his sincere Intentions of holding a personal Treaty with the Parliament of  London  by sending the following Warrant  Having designed to comply with the Designs of our Parliament in every thing that may be for the Good of our Subjects and leave no Means unattempted for removing of Differences between us therefore we have thought the more to evidence the Reality of our Intention of settling a happy Peace to require you upon Honourable Conditions to quit the Towns Castles and Forts intrusted to you by us and to disband all the Forces under your several Commands Given at  Newcastle  the th of  June    To our Trusty and Wellbeloved Sir  Thomas Glenham  Sir  Thomas Tisby  Colonel  Washington  Colonel  Blague  Governors of our Cities and Towns of  Oxford Wor∣cester Litchfield  and  Wallingford  and to all other Commanders of any other Towns Castles or Forts within the Kingdom of  England  or Dominion of  Wales  The  Scots  now in some Jealousy how mightily the King complies with his Parliament and that they should not be able perhaps to effect their Designs by Force endeavour it by Fraud and Cunning by insinuating to the Parliament that their Conscience bears them Witness of their constant Endeavours to preserve the Union of both Kingdoms yet never more than since the King's coming to their Army by effecting such Messages from his Ma∣jesty as might be a sure Ground of Peace to his People and Happiness to himself And although we have not as yet prevailed over his Principles deeply rooted in him as to obtain the utmost of our Desires which we hope in a short Time to effect and we hope that accordingly the Parliament will be pleased to send their Propositions of Peace to him upon whose Answer we shall clearly know how to proceed in the intendedPacification and to satisfy the Parliament in disbanding our Armies delivering up the Garrisons Possessed by us and retiring home for the Good of both Kingdoms  This

Aldermen and Commonalty of this Town did most freely and unanimously joyne in a Petition to the House of Commons for speedy and impartial Justice upon the great Incendiaries be∣twixt these two Kingdoms and the chief Promoters of this Election who have already confess'd them∣selves guilty of all the Blood which hath been shed by this unnatural Warr who have been twice con∣quered by Us and this we ground upon our  Solemn League and Covenant  to which we have always ad∣hered and by which all Delinquents ought to be brought to condign Punishment without Exception though our Treaties have upon what Grounds wee know not nor are not yet satisfyed admitted of a Personal Treaty with the Cheife of Them as if after twice conquered he or his Party was sensible there∣of and of whom as wee yet hear of any Conviction of Conscience or Judgment but only for an Op∣portunity to cut the Throats of Us and all others that have ingaged against them in this Nation and be∣ing so unhappy that wee could not by any Means obtain their Judgment thereof or Intentions thereupon it hath added many sad Fears and Thoughts to our former Perplexities and even astonshed Us to consi∣der how our Bondage and Ruine is by this Treaty since our Petition so just rational and in Prosecution of our Covenant and their own Proceedings should appear unworthy of the least Respects or Conside∣ration and therefore Wee must still endeavour to keep our first Integrity without Spott and Blemish for if wee would never bow the Knee to  Baal  at the King's Command wee will never do it at the Par∣liament's and if they act against the Truth reposed in them by the People the People are bound in Con∣science and Duty to act against them  Salus Populi  being  Suprema Lex  The Lord direct Us for his Glory and the Good of the poor Commons of  England  who are like to be bought and sold because they are ignorant of their own Freedom and Birthright which they are willing to sell for a Mease of Pottage so they may injoy a

to our Magistrates much concurrent with the Intelligence you received from Court and desired me to press Mr Mayor Sir  James Clavering  and Sir  Fracis Anderson  with this necessary Duty of suppressing these illegal riotous schisma∣tical and as near as may be conjectured seditious Assemblies And this to be done with the Concurrence of the rest of the Ministers I have had little Time

Conventicles in Execution so for as we had any Information and have convicted se∣veral Persons upon the late Act against Conventicles and taken Care to prevent these Meetings under Pretence of Worship by employing the ChurchWardens to give Information in Case they could discover any We do take the late Statute against Conventicles to be in Force and shall be always ready to pro∣ceed to punish Offenders against it and if any Offenders have not been punished it was for Want of Evi∣dence to convict them and if those Persons that informed your Lordship would have been pleased to have acquainted us we would have taken away all Cause of Complaint  We desire your Lordship would please to take Care of the Inclosed and acquaint the King with our Pro∣ceedings herein We should not have

in that Town whereinto both you and my self are in this Case intrusted to have a particular and diligent Inspection But on the other Side I am sorry to hear from you that you have had neither any Information nor any Evi∣dence given you against such unlawful Assemblies in your Town when the Notoriety of the Fact by their numerous Meeting at your BarberChirurgeon  's  Hall upon  AllSaints  Day last being  Sunday  the st of  No∣vember  was such that it was voic'd and made known to all the Town and Country about Notice being also taken what special  Psalm  or  New Rejoicing Song  they then chose and applied to themselves as  Holy Saints  of  Bearing a doubleedged Sword in their Hands to bind kings in Chains and Lords in Iron Bands  of which notorious and unlawful Meeting both my self and divers others here at this Distance were shortly  after informed and I took the best Care I could thereupon to have an Address made unto you Mr Mayor by a special Person under my Episcopal Jurisdiction to desire you that you would not suffer any such scan∣dalous and offensive Meetings to be held among you contrary to the known Laws of this Church and Realm of  England  and greatly endangering the Publick Peace thereof And this I did before I acquainted his Majesty or his Principal Secretaries with it neither was there any Letter sent to you and the Alder∣men from his Majesty concerning this Matter before a second Information came both to my self and Mr  Brabant  one of your own Society of another numerous and unlawful Meeting at one of the Ringleader's Houses upon the th

chief Leaders and Abettors Mr  Gilpine  Mr  Durant  Mr  Leaver  and Mr  Pringle  Of all which surely you had or might have had Knowledge and if you had not you will give me Leave to say without Offence that many of your Townsmen are very backward in discovering to you and arresting their Knowledge of such disorderly Assemblies and that you are very great Strangers to the Affairs and Disturbances of your own Town the Government whereof under his Majesty is committed to your Care  It is well taken that as you write you have proceeded and convicted several of these disobedient Per∣sons already and that you will take Care to prevent their Meetings against Law for Time to come which good Resolution being observed by you will highly please his Majesty and express the Duty that we owe to his Laws and the good Government of this Realm Otherwise if we any ways neglect to do herein what belongs to us we shall deservedly suffer the Blame of it and incur the King's Displeasure

William Christian  The CASE of  Gosforth  CHAPPEL and the Repairs thereof  Dr  BASIRE  Archdeacon of  Northumberland  's Letter to Dr  THO SMITH  Dean of  Carlisle  dated  Durham Sept  Reverend and Honoured  SIR  I Did purposely delay my Answer to your last of the d past till at my last Visitation I had enquired after and examined the Reparation of the Chappel of  Gosforth  within the Vicarage of  Newcastle  the Result whereof is The said Chappel is not a Chappel of Ease but a Parochial Chappel which the Mo∣therChurch is not bound to repair but belongs to themselves You know very well the Episcopal Sentence at the Dedication of such Chappels the Body whereof lies upon the Parishioners of the Chappel and the Chancel upon the Impropriators or Appropriators That by Order of Mr  George Willoughby  Tenant to the Lord Bishop of  Carlisle  for his Part of the Tythes Mr  Carr  Alderman of  Newcastle  his SubTenant hath configned  l  about the th Instant into the Hands of Capt  Fenwick  and Mr  William Musgrave  Cu∣rate of  Gosforth  for the Repair of the same and I am confident the Dean and Chapter will be as forward to follow that Example You were mi  nformed concerning the Obligation of the poor Vicar of St  Nicholas  to repair the Chappel upon a Supposition that the Benefit of the Mortuaries and of the Burials there belongs to him which you say are  s    d  for each Burial whereof the Vicar receives but  s    d  but the Burthen of repairing the Chappels would 'tis siad surcharge the Vicarage in Value thrice over  Having no more to trouble you withal at this Time but to commend my self to your good Prayers I remain  Reverend  SIR  Your very Affectionate Friend and Faithful Servant  ISAAC BASIRE  Pray present my humble Service to my Lord your Bishop  A  CASE  touching the Chancel of the Church of  South Gosforth  and some Proceedings concerning the same truly Stated  IT is clear Law that when no Person or Persons appear who are liable to the Repair of either Church or Chancol that in such Case the Tythes or other Profits within that Parish are to be sequester'd for the said Repaire after Notice given to the Parties concerned in such Profits  Constitut D Othon  p  c  De Facto  Notice was frequently given to the Lord Bishop and Dean and Chapter of  Carlisle  who are Impropriators of the Tythan within the Parish of  Gosforth  and to their Farmers likewise who should have appeared and showed something in Discharge of the  Onus Reparandi  for  Gosforth  Church is neither Chap∣pel of Ease nonParochial Chappel within the Rectory of St  Nicholas  as the Case was mistated to Dr  Exton  Because  Gosforth  is reputed and taken to be a Church and Parish distinct The Parish of St  Nicholas  is no Rectory but a Vicarage and in Cast two Churches Parochial be united as probably these may be the Reparation shall be severall as before  Hob  The Case was mistated to Dr  Exton  in a ma∣terial and essential Part thereof being put of an Impropriator who repairs a MotherChurch for first  non Consent  in the Case of  Gosforth  Church that St  Nicholas  is the MotherChurch but rather the contrary as above Secondly it is notorious that the Do  and Chapter of  Carlisle  have refused to repair the Chancel of St  Nicholas  and particularly to allow the late Dean's Accounts who  de facto  once repaired it so that the Case put to Dr  Exton  differing essentially from this his Opinion which is allowed to be good Law cannot reach this  The Impropriators of the Parish of  Gosforth  may be soon satisfied tho' it was once denied them from the Authorities formerly sent that Impropriators as well as the Parson  de Communi Jure  ought to repair the Chancel unless they can prove contrary by Custom or Composition  Dr  SMITH  Dean of  Carlisle  's Letter to Dr  BASIRE  Reverend  SIR  Cockermouth  Jan    UPON reading of your Paper which you sent inclosed to my Lord our Bishop touching the Repairs of  Gosforth  Chappel I presently observed that the Authorities therein quoted are indeed very clear and full as to the repairing of the MotherChurch but reach not at all to Chappels the Burthen whereof I have always been told did lie wholly upon the Inhabitants within each such Chapplery the Parson or Impropriators being no Way liable thereunto However for my better Satisfaction I wrote to a Friend of mine in  London  and requested him to consult some able Civilian about it and send me down his Opi∣nion The Quaere which I sent up was expressed in these very Words  Whether an Impropriator be obliged of common Right to repair and uphold the Chancels not only of the MotherChurch but of all the Chappels likewise within the Rectory and whether the Di∣stinction of Chappels Parochial and Chappels of Ease make any Difference in the Case  The Person consulted was Dr  Exton  Chancellor to the Bishop of  London  whose Opinion under his own Hand I here send you inclosed hoping it will give you Satisfaction or if
