learned in all ages have given a sanction to biographical history and concurred to recommend that precept of the wise son of Sirach in which we are exhorted to  'praise famous men such as by their counsels and by their knowledge of learning were meet for the peopleand were wise and eloquent in their instructionsand such as recited verses in writing  Ecclus Chap XLIV Verse et seqq  '  In each of these faculties did the person whose history I am about to write so greatly excel that except for my presumption in the attempt to display his worth the undertaking may be thought to need no apology especially if we contemplate together with his mental endowments those moral qualities which distinguished him and reflect that in an age when literary acquisitions and  scientific improvements are rated at their utmost value he rested not in the applause which these procured him but adorned the character of a scholar and a philosopher with that of a christian  Justified as I trust thus far in the opinion of the reader I may nevertheless stand in need of his excuse for that in the narration of facts that respect others I have oftener spoke of myself and in my own person than the practice of some writers will warrant To this objection if any shall please to make it I answer that the reverse of wrong is not always right By the office I have undertaken I stand engaged to relate facts to which I was a witness conversations in which I was a party and to record memorable sayings uttered only to myself Whoever attends to these circumstances must besides the disgust which such an affectation of humility would excite be convinced that in some instances the avoiding of egotisms had been extremely difficult and in many impossible  SAMUEL JOHNSON the subject of the following memoirs was the elder of the two sons of Michael Johnson of the city of Lichfield bookseller and of Sarah his wife a sister of Dr Joseph Ford a physician of great eminence and father of the famous Cornelius otherwise called Parson Ford  Of this person who yet lives in the remembrance of a few of his associates little can be related but from oral tradition He was as I have heard Johnson say a man of great wit and stupendous parts but of very profligate manners He was chaplain to Lord Chesterfield during his residence at the Hague but as his lordship was used to tell him precluded all hope of preferment by the want of a vice namely hypocrisy It was supposed that the parson in Hogarth's modern midnight conversation was intended to represent him in his hour of festivity four in the morning  He was born as I  find it noted in his diary on the seventh day of September his brother named Nathanael was born some years after Mr Johnson was a man of eminence in his trade and of such reputation in the city abovementioned that he more than once bore for a year the office of bailiff or chief magistrate thereof and discharged the duties of that exalted station with honour and applause It may here be proper as it will account for some particulars respecting the character of his son Samuel to mention that his political principles led him to favour the pretensions of the exiled family and that though a very honest and sensible man he like many others inhabiting the county of Stafford was a Jacobite  It may farther be supposed that he was possessed of some amiable qualities either moral or personal from a circumstance in his early life of which evidence is yet remaining While he was an apprentice at Leek in Staffordshire a young woman of the same town fell in love with him and upon his removal to Lichfield followed him and took lodgings opposite his house Her passion was not unknown to Mr Johnson but he had no inclination to return it till he heard that it so affected her mind that her life was in danger when he visited her and made her a tender of his hand but feeling the approach of death she declined it and shortly after died and was interred in Lichfield cathedral In pity  to her sufferings Mr Johnson caused a stone to be placed over her grave with this inscription  Here lies the body of  Mrs ELIZABETH BLANEY a stranger  She departed this life  d of September  The first born child of Mr Johnson and his wife their son Samuel had the misfortune to receive together with its nutriment derived from a hired nurse the seeds of that disease which troubled him through life the struma or as it is called the king'sevil for the cure whereof his mother agreeable to the opinion then entertained of the efficacy of the royal touch presented him to Queen Anne who for the last time as it is said that she ever performed that office with her accustomed grace and benignity administered to the child as much of that healing quality as it was in her power to dispense and hung about his neck the usual amulet of an angel of gold with the impress of St Michael the archangel on the one side and a ship under full sail on the other  This healing gift is said to have been derived to our princes from Edward the Confessor and is recorded by his historian Alured Rivallensis In Stow's annals we have a relation of the first cure of this kind which Edward performed but as it is rather disgusting to read it I chuse to give it in the words of the author from whence it is apparently taken with this remark that the kings of France lay claim to the same miraculous power  'Adolescentula quaedam tradita nuptiis duplici laborabat incommodo Nam faciem ejus morbus deformaverat amorem viri sterilitas prolis ademerat sub faucibus quippe quasi glandes ei succreverant quae totam faciem deformi tumore foedantes putrefactis sub cute humoribus sanguinem in saniem verterant inde nati vermes odorem teterrimum exhalabant Ita viro incutiebat morbus

obducta vulneribus cicatrice incolumis rediret ad propria Verum ut nichil deesset regi ad gloriam pauperculae nichil ad gratiam donatur sterili inopina foecunditas ventrisque sui desiderato fructu ditata facile sibi mariti gratiam conciliavit'  The reader will find much curious matter relating to the royal touch in Mr Barrington's observations on ancient statutes and in Chambers's dictionary art EVIL to which I shall add that the vindication of this power as inherent in the pretender by Mr Carte destroyed the credit of his intended history of England and put a stop to the completion of it  The ritual for this is to be found in Bishop Sparrow's collection of articles canons c and also in all or most of the impressions of the Common Prayer Book printed in Queen Anne's reign but in these latter with great variations  It was probably  thisdisease that deprived him of the sight of his left eye for he has been heard to say that he never remembered to have enjoyed the use of it  It may seem a ridiculous attempt to trace the dawn of his poetical faculty so far back as to his very infancy but the following incident I am compelled to mention as it is well attested and therefore makes part of his history When he was about three years old his mother had a brood of eleven ducklings which she permitted him to call his own It happened that in playing about he trod on and killed one of them upon which running to his mother he in great emotion bid her write Write child said she what must I write Why write answered he so  Here lies good Master Duck  That Samuel Johnson trod on  If't had liv'd 'twould have been good luck  For then there'd been an odd one  and she wrote accordingly  Being arrived at a proper age for grammatical instruction he was placed in the free school of Lichfield of which Mr Hunter was then master The progress he made in his learning soon attracted the notice of his teachers and among other discernible qualities that distinguished him from the rest of the school he was bold active and enterprising so that without affecting it the seniors in the school looked on him as their head and leader and readily acquiesced in whatever he proposed or did There dwelt at Lichfield a gentleman of the name of Butt the father of the reverend Mr Butt now a King's Chaplain to whose house on holidays and in schoolvacations he was ever welcome The children in the family perhaps offended with the rudeness of his behaviour would frequently call him the great boy which the father once overhearing said  'you call him the great boy but take my word for it he will one day prove a great man'  A more particular character of him while a schoolboy and of his behaviour at school I find in a paper now before me written by a person yet living and of which the following is a copy  'Johnson and I were early in life schoolfellows at Lichfield and for many years in the same class As his uncommon abilities for learning far exceeded us we endeavoured by every boyish piece of flattery to gain his assistance and three of us by turns used to call on him in a morning on one of whose backs supported by the other two he rode triumphantly to school He never associated with us in any of our diversions except in the winter when the ice was firm to be drawn along by a boy barefooted His ambition to excel was great though his application to books as far as it appeared was very trifling I could not oblige him more than by sauntering away every vacation that occurred in the fields during which time he was more engaged in talking to himself than his companion Verses or themes he would dictate to his favourites but he would never be at the trouble of writing them His dislike to business was so great that he would procrastinate his exercises to the last hour I have known him after a long vacation in which we were rather severely tasked return to school an hour earlier in the morning and begin one of his exercises in which he purposely left some faults in order to gain time to finish the rest  'I never knew him corrected at school unless it was for talking and diverting other boys from their  business by which perhaps he might hope to keep his ascendancy He was uncommonly inquisitive and his memory so tenacious that whatever he read or heard he never forgot I remember rehearsing to him eighteen verses which after a little pause he repeated verbatim except one epithet which improved the line  'After a long absence from Lichfield when he returned I was apprehensive of something wrong in his constitution which might either impair his intellect or endanger his life but thanks to Almighty God my fears have proved false'  In the autumn of the year he received an invitation from his uncle Cornelius Ford to spend a few days with him at his house which I conjecture to have been on a living of his in one of the counties bordering upon Staffordshire but it seems that the uncle discovering that the boy was possessed of uncommon parts was unwilling to let him return and to make up for the loss he might sustain by his absence from school became his instructor in the classics and farther assisted him in his studies so that it was not till the Whitfuntide following that Johnson went back to Lichfield Whether Mr Hunter was displeased to find a visit of a few days protracted into a vacation of many months or that he resented the interference of another person in the tuition of one of his scholars and he one of the most promising of any under his care cannot now be known but it seems that at Johnson's return to Lichfield he was not received into the school of that city on the contrary I am informed by a person who was his schoolfellow there that he was placed in one at Stourbridge in Worcestershire under the care of a master named Winkworth  but who affecting to be thought allied to the Strafford family assumed the name of Wentworth  When his school education was finished his father whose circumstances were far from affluent was for some time at a loss how to dispose of him he took him home probably with a view to bring him up to his own trade for I have heard Johnson say that he himself was able to bind a book This suspense continued about two years at the end whereof a neighbouring gentleman Mr Andrew Corbet having a son who had been educated in the same school with Johnson whom he was about to send to Pembroke college in Oxford a proposal was made and accepted that Johnson should attend this son thither in quality of assistant in his studies and accordingly on the st day of October they were both entered Corbet as a gentlemancommoner and Johnson as a commoner  The college tutor at that time was a man named Jordan whom Johnson though he loved him for the goodness of his nature so contemned for the meanness of his abilities that he would oftener risque the payment of a small fine than attend his lectures nor was he studious to conceal the reason of his absence Upon occasion of one such imposition he said to Jordan  'Sir you have sconced me twopence for non'attendance at a lecture not worth a penny'  Whether it was this discouragement in the outset of their studies or any other ground of disinclination that moved him to it is not known but this is certain that young Corbet could not brook submission to a man who seemed to be little more learned than himself and  that having a father living who was able to dispose of him in various other ways he after about two years stay left the college and went home  But the case of Johnson was far different his fortunes were at sea his title to a stipend was gone and all that he could obtain from the father of Mr Corbet was an agreement during his continuance at college to pay for his commons With no exhibition or other means of support in the prosecution of his studies he had nothing to depend on save the assistance of a kind and indulgent parent At that time the trade of a country bookseller even in a city where was a cathedral and an incorporation of ecclesiastics was less profitable than it is now for though it may be said that during the reign of Queen Anne multitudes of controversial books and pamphlets were publishing yet these yielded but small advantage to the mere venders of them there were then no such publications for the mere amusement of young readers or idle persons as the press now daily sends forth nor had any bookseller entertained in his mind the project of a circulating library from hence it is evident that his father having no other means of subsisting himself and his children than the ordinary income of his shop was but little able to afford him any other than a scanty maintenance  The want of that assistance which scholars in general derive from their parents relations and friends soon became visible in the garb and appearance of Johnson which though in some degree concealed by a scholar's gown and that we know is never deemed the less honourable for being old was so apparent as to  excite pity in some that saw and noticed him Shall I be particular and relate a circumstance of his distress that cannot be imputed to him as an effect of his own extravagance or irregularity and consequently reflects no disgrace on his memory He had scarce any change of raiment and in a short time after Corbet left him but one pair of shoes and those so old that his feet were seen through them a gentleman of his college the father of an eminent clergyman now living directed a servitor one morning to place a new pair at the door of Johnson's chamber who seeing them upon his first going out so far forgot himself and the spirit that must have actuated his unknown benefactor that with all the indignation of an insulted man he threw them away  He may be supposed to have been under the age of twenty when this imaginary indignity was offered him a period of life at which so far as concerns the knowledge of mankind and the means of improving adverse circumstances every one has much to learn he had doubtless before this time experienced  'the proud man's contumely'  and in this school of affliction might have first had reason to say  Slow rises worth by poverty deprest  his spirit was nevertheless too great to sink under this depression His tutor Jordan in about a year's space went off to a living which he had been presented to upon giving a bond to resign it in favour of a minor and Johnson became the pupil of Mr Adams a person of far superior endowments who afterwards attained a doctor's degree and is at this time head of his college Encouraged by a change so propitious to his  studies he prosecuted them with diligence attended both public and private lectures performed his exercises with alacrity and in short neglected no means or opportunities of improvement He had at this time a great emulation to call it by no worse a name to excel his competitors in literature There was a young gentleman of his college named Meekes whose exercises he could not bear to hear commended and whenever he declaimed or disputed in the hall Johnson would retire to the farthest corner thereof that he might be out of the reach of his voice  In this course of learning his favourite objects were classical literature ethics and theology in the latter whereof he laid the foundation by studying the Fathers If we may judge from the magnitude of his Adversaria which I have now by me his plan for study was a very extensive one The heads of science to the extent of six folio volumes are copiously branched throughout it but as is generally the case with young students the blank far exceed in number the written leaves  To say the truth the course of his studies was far from regular he read by fits and starts and in the intervals digested his reading by meditation to which he was ever prone Neither did he regard the hours of study farther than the discipline of the college compelled him It was the practice in his time for a servitor by order of the master to go round to the rooms of the young men and knocking at the door to enquire if they were within and if no answer was returned to report them absent Johnson could not endure this intrusion and would frequently be silent when the utterance of a word would have insured him from censure  and farther to be revenged for being disturbed when he was as profitably employed as perhaps he could be would join with others of the young men in the college in hunting as they called it the servitor who was thus diligent in his duty and this they did with the noise of pots and candlesticks singing to the tune of Chevychace the words in that old ballad  To drive the deer with hound and horn c  not seldom to the endangering the life and limbs of the unfortunate victim  These and other such levities marked his behaviour for a short time after his coming to college but he soon convinced those about him that he came thither for other purposes than to make sport either for himself or them His exercises were applauded and his tutor was not so shallow a man but that he could discover in Johnson great skill in the classics and also a talent for Latin versification by such compositions as few of his standing could equal Mr Jordan taking advantage therefore of a transgression of this his pupil the absenting himself from early prayers imposed on him for a vacation exercise the task of translating into Latin verse the Messiah of Mr Pope which being shewn to the author of the original by a son of Dr Arbuthnot then a gentlemancommoner of Christchurch and brother of the late Mr Arbuthnot of the Exchequeroffice was read and returned with this encomium  'The writer of this poem will leave it a question for posterity whether his or mine be the original'  Mr Pope in another instance gave a proof of his candor and disposition to encourage the essays of young men of genius When Smart published his Latin translation of Mr Pope's ode on St Cecilia's day Mr Pope having read it in a letter to Newbery the publisher of it returned his thanks to the author with an assurance that it exceeded his own original This fact Newbery himself told me and offered to shew me the letter in Mr Pope's handwriting  This  translation found its way into a miscellany published by subscription at Oxford in the year under the name of J Husbands  He had but little relish for mathematical learning and was content with such a degree of knowledge in physics as he could not but acquire in the ordinary exercises of the place his fortunes and circumstances had determined him to no particular course of study and were such as seemed to exclude him from every one of the learned professions He more than once signified to a friend who had been educated at the same school with him then at Christchurch and intended for the bar an inclination to the practice of the civil or the common law the former of these required a long course of academical institution and how to succeed in the latter he had not learned  In the two professions of the civil and common law a notable difference is discernible the former admits such only as have had the previous qualification of an university education the latter receives all whose broken fortunes drive or a confidence in their abilities tempts to seek a maintenance in it Men of low extraction domestic servants and clerks to eminent lawyers have become special pleaders and advocates and by an unrestrained abuse of the liberty of speech have acquired popularity and wealth A remarkable instance of this kind occurs in the account of a famous lawyer of the last century lord chief justice Saunders as exhibited in the life of the lord keeper Guilford Page  'He was at first no better than a poor beggar boy if not a parish foundling without known parents or relations He had found a way to live by obsequiousness in  Clement'sInn  as I remember and courting the attornies clerks for scraps The extraordinary observance and diligence of the boy made the society willing to do him good He appeared very ambitious to learn to write and one of the attornies got a board knocked up at a window on the top of a staircase and that was his desk where he sat and wrote after copies of court and other hands the clerks gave him He made himself so expert a writer that he took in business and earned some pence by hackneywriting And thus by degrees he pushed his faculties and fell to forms and by books that were lent him became an exquisite enteringclerk and by the same course of improvement of himself an able counsel first in special pleading then at large And after he was called to the bar had practice in the  King's Bench  court equal with any there'  He succeeded Pemberton in the office of chief justice of the king's bench and died of an apoplexy and palsy a short time before the revolution A curious delineation of his person and character may be seen in the volume above cited  but his father's inability to support him  checked these wishes and left him to seek the means of a future subsistence If nature could be said to have pointed out a profession for him that of the bar seems to have been it in that faculty his acuteness and penetration and above all his nervous and manly elocution could scarcely have failed to distinguish him and to have raised him to the highest honours of that lucrative profession but whatever nature might have intended for him fortune seems to have been the arbiter of his destiny and by shutting up the avenues to wealth and civil honours to have left him to display his talents in the several characters of a moralist a philosopher and a poet  The time of his continuance at Oxford is divisible into two periods the former whereof commenced on the st day of October and determined in December  when as appears by a note in his diary in these words  ' Dec S J Oxonio rediir'  he left that place the reason whereof was a failure of pecuniary supplies from his father but meeting with another source the bounty as it is supposed of some one or more of the members of the cathedral he returned and made up the whole of his residence in the university about three years during all which time his academical studies though not orderly were to an astonishing degree intense Whoever has perused Mr Spence's life of Antonio Magliabechi may discern a near resemblance in their manner of reading between that person and Johnson the former says his author  'seems never to have applied himself to any particular study A passion for reading was his ruling passion and a prodigious memory his great talent he read every book almost indifferently as they happened to come into his hands he read them with a surprising quickness and yet retained not only the sense of what he read but often all the words and the very manner of spelling them if there was any thing peculiar of that kind in any author'  A like propensity to reading and an equal celerity in the practice thereof were observable in Johnson it was wonderful to see when he took up a book with what eagerness he perused and with what haste his eye for it has been related that he had the use of only one travelled over it he has been known to read a volume and that not a small one at a sitting nor was he inferior in the power of memory to him with whom he is compared whatever he read became his own for ever with all the advantages that a penetrating judgment and deep reflection could add to it I  have heard him repeat with scarce a mistake of a word passages from favourite authors of three or four octavo pages in length One instance of the greatness of his retentive faculty himself has thought fit to give in his life of the Earl of Rochester where may be seen a Latin poem upon Nothing written by Passerat for the infertion whereof he had as it is said no other aid than his own recollection How far he approved that method of reading which he is above said to have pursued and what value he set on the powers of memory may be inferred from his character of the former of those persons in his lives of the poets of whom he thus speaks  'He was remarkable for the power of reading with great rapidity and of retaining with great fidelity what he so easily collected He therefore always knew what the present question required and when his friends expressed their wonder at his acquisitions made in a state of apparent negligence and drunkenness he never discovered his hours of reading or method of study but involved himself in affected silence and fed his own vanity with their admiration and conjectures'  It is little less than certain that his own indigence and the inability of his father to help him called Johnson from the university sooner than he meant to quit it his father either during his continuance there or possibly before had been by misfortunes rendered insolvent if not as Johnson told me an actual bankrupt The nonattainment of a degree which after a certain standing is conferred almost of course he regretted not it is true he soon felt the want of one but ample amends were afterwards made him by  the voluntary grant of the highest academical honours that two of the most learned seminaries in Europe could bestow  The advantages he derived from an university education small as they may hitherto seem went a great way towards fixing as well his moral as his literary character the order and discipline of a college life the reading the best authors the attendance on public exercises the early calls to prayer the frequent instructions from the pulpit with all the other means of religious and moral improvement had their proper effect and though they left his natural temper much as they found it they begat in his mind those sentiments of piety which were the rule of his conduct throughout his future life and made so conspicuous a part of his character  He could not at this early period of his life divest himself of an opinion that poverty was disgraceful and was very severe in his censures of that oeconomy in both our universities which exacted at meals the attendance of poor scholars under the several denominations of servitors in the one and sizers in the other he thought that the scholar's like the christian life levelled all distinctions of rank and worldly preeminence but in this he was mistaken civil policy had long before his coming into the world reduced the several classes of men to a regular subordination and given servitude its sanction The feudal system of government throughout Europe had so arranged the several orders of subjects that the lower were uniformly dependent on the higher and in the history of the peerage of our own country we find the retinues of the higher nobility made up of the sons and daughters  of those of the lower Wolsey had in his train earls barons and knights and the founder of the present Cavendish family was his gentlemanusher at a salary of ten pounds a year and to justify the practice of personal servitude at meals we have an example of a child waiting on his parents while at dinner in the Pietas Puerilis among the colloquies of Erasmus  Adornatâ parentibus mensâ recito consecrationem deinde prandentibus ministro donec jubeor et ipse prandium sumere    Upon his leaving the university he went home to the house of his father which he found so nearly filled with relations that is to say the maiden sisters of his mother and uncle Cornelius Ford whom his father on the decease of their brother in the summer of had taken in to board that it would scarce receive him  He brought with him a deep sense of religion a due reverence for the national church and a respect for its ministers and these he retained though he had been a witness to the profligacy of his uncle Ford which was nearly enough to have effaced all such impressions from a young mind Having not then seen as we now do ecclesiastical benefices advertised for sale and considered by the purchasers as layfees nor beheld many of the beneficed clergy abandoning the duties of the clerical function to the lowest of their order themselves becoming gentlemen at large mixing in all public recreations and amusements  While this is the case there can be very little hope of mending the situation of the inserior clergy An increase of income would raise them to a condition of employing substitutes whom mere necessity would compel to the performance of their duty and these would have the same reason to complain as those who at present are the objects of our compassion In a word were the gradations of the clergy to be multiplied the most essential offices of their function would continue as they now are to be the employment of the lowest of them  neglecting their studies  for cards preaching the sermons of others and affecting in many particulars of their dress the garb of the laity in disobedience to the canon which enjoins decency of apparel to ministers  The th of  I say not having been a witness to these late refinements in manners he notwithstanding the ferocity of his temper reverenced the clergy as a body of men who have been the greatest improvers of learning and to whom mankind have the highest obligations but lamented that the race was nearly extinct  As Johnson's stay at the university was not long enough for him to complete his studies it is natural to suppose that at his return to Lichfield he devoted his time to the improvement of them and that having no call from thence he continued there till the death of his father which as he has noted it was in the month of December  Being thus bereft of the little support his father was able to afford him and having not only a profession but the means of subsistence to seek he in the month of March accepted of an invitation to the office of undermaster or usher of a free grammarschool at MarketBosworth in Leicestershire founded and endowed by Sir Wolstan Dixie lord mayor of London in the upper master whereof was the reverend Anthony Blackwall the author of a wellknown book on the sacred classics The patron of this seminary was Sir Wolstan Dixie baronet a descendant of the original founder and the endowment being very small Johnson's residence was in the mansionhouse of Sir Wolstan adjacent thereto but the treatment he received from this person who in the pride of wealth shewed no regard for learning or parts nor respected  any man for his mental endowments was such that preferring the chance of the wide world to his patronage Johnson in the month of July in the same year in which he went to Bosworth resigned his office and took leave of a place which he could never after speak of but in terms of the utmost dislike and even of abhorrence  By the middle of June in the year he was able to estimate that slender pittance which devolved to him upon the decease of his father the amount whereof I find ascertained by a memorandum in his diary which as it is descriptive of his circumstances at the time I here translate and at the bottom of the page have inserted verbatim  June I laid by eleven guineas on which day I received all of my father's effects which I can hope for till the death of my mother which I pray may be late that is to say twenty pounds so that I have my fortune to make and care must be taken that in the mean time the powers of my mind may not grow languid through poverty nor want drive me into wickedness  ' Junii Undecim aureos deposui quo die quicquid ante matris funus quod serum sit precor de paternis bonis sperare licet viginti scilicet libras accepi Usque adeo mihi mea fortuna fingenda est interea ne paupertate vires animi languescant ne in flagitia egestas adigat cavendum    In the month of June in the following year I find him resident in the house of a person named Jarvis at Birmingham where as he has noted in his diary he rendered into English from the French a voyage to Abyssinia which has since appeared to be that of Padre Jerome Lobo a Portuguese Jesuit with  the additions of Mons l'Abbé Le Grand very curious and entertaining of which the following is a character  It contains a narration of the endeavours of a company of missionaries of the author's country to unite the Abyssins to the church of Rome It was translated from the original Portuguese into French by l'Abbé Le Grand who as Lobo had extended it no farther than his own concern in the mission continued it down to the time when the Jesuits were finally driven out of Aethiopia with the addition of fifteen dissertations on subjects relating to the history antiquities government religion manners and natural history of Abyssinia and other countries mentioned by the original author  The preface which bears stronger marks of Johnson's hand than any part of the work is calculated to attract attention and credit it commends the unaffected simplicity of the original narrative and the learning of M Le Grand it acknowledges the omissions and deviations which the translator thought it prudent to make and it apologizes for any defects that may be discovered Johnson's disquisitive propensity just dawns in an observation on the erroneous method of the Roman church in making converts but there is nothing striking in the composition  Were we to rest our judgment on internal evidence Johnson's claim to the title of translator of this work would be disputable it has scarce a feature resembling him the language is as simple and unornamented as John Bunyan's the style is far from elegant and sometimes it is not even correct These circumstances together with frequent mistakes and various orthography would almost stagger our belief but  that we have the authority of Johnson himself to rely on who often acknowledged it for his own  As this voyage to Abyssinia notwithstanding the country and manners it describes are wonderful and interesting has not been so much noticed as Johnson's later and original productions it may not be thought impertinent to give the outline of the relation  About the beginning of the seventeenth century the then reigning emperor of Abyssinia for considerations that favoured more of good policy than of religion became a convert to the church of Rome many of his subjects had followed his example and the missionaries already in the country were in want of coadjutors to extend their progress Padre Jerome Lobo who was then employed in the EastIndian mission at Goa was one deputed to this enterprise which at length proved too much for Romish zeal and Jesuitical dexterity  With much difficulty he and his companions reached and got footing in the empire where they had to endure a climate rendered by excessive heats and rains pestiferous and to engage in perilous journies across desarts infested by banditti in perpetual fear of them and of wild beasts the tokens of whose depredations marked their way When they arrived at the habitations of the people their dangers were changed but not diminished sometimes they could not obtain provisions and at others were confined to their houses by the dread of assassination Those who were to be their disciples professed it is true a superstitious religion in some parts Judaical in many others resembling that of the church of Rome but it had had little effect on their minds moral virtues they had  scarcely any in social affections they were miserably deficient and their approaches to civilization and elegance were on a level with those of their southern neighbours at the Cape of Good Hope  But labour and patience produced in time a hope that the mission would not be fruitless the number of their proselytes was at one period so great that the corporal strength of the fathers was exhausted in the exhortations previous to baptism  'We erected our tent' says Lobo 'and placed our altar under some great trees for the benefit of the shade and every day before sunrising my companion and I began to catechise and instruct these new catholics and used our utmost endeavours to make them abjure their errors When we were weary with speaking we placed in ranks those who were sufficiently instructed and passing through them with great vessels of water baptized them according to the form prescribed by the church As their number was very great we cried aloud  those of this rank are named  Anthony  those of that rank  Peterand did the same among the women whom we separated from among the men We then confessed them and admitted them to the communion After mass we applied ourselves again to catechise to instruct and receive the renunciation of their errors scarce allowing ourselves time to make a scanty meal which we never did more than once a day'  Zeal equal to this and rising in proportion to the opposition it met with did these pious fathers exercise during nine years that they remained in Abyssinia Their success was various and fluctuating sometimes it gave them ground to hope that all would be converted  and sometimes their patrons and proselytes became their most inveterate persecutors their hardships were increased by civil commotions and all their expectations were clouded by the death of the Emperor whose successor was a bigot in the religion of the country They then put themselves under the protection of a prince who had emancipated himself from the power of Abyssinia and thought that as he had afforded them succour they should be safe in his dominions but they were soon convinced of their error by receiving orders to prepare to serve or in other words become slaves to the Turks  'a message' says Lobo 'which filled us with surprise it having never been known that one of these lords had ever abandoned any whom he had taken under his protection and it is on the contrary one of the highest points of honour amongst them to risque their lives and their fortunes in the defence of their dependents who have implored their protection but neither law nor justice were of any advantage to us and the customs of the country were doomed to be broken when they would have contributed to our security'  From M Le Grand's information it appears that the conduct of these missionaries in Abyssinia had been such as tended rather to exasperate than conciliate they considered themselves not only figuratively as the generals of Christ's church militant and propagated their faith by measures that rendered them and their doctrine odious The peace of the country and their residence in it were become incompatible they were accordingly delivered into the hands of the Turks and experienced from a little troop sent to convoy them greater humanity than the Abyssins had  shewn them at Suaquem an island in the Red Sea terms of ransom were proposed to them which though exorbitant they were forced to accept and after surmounting many obstacles and perils that part of the mission with which Lobo was engaged returned to Goa  The revenge which it was reported in Abyssinia the court of Portugal meditated rendered a people naturally inhuman ferocious the remaining missionaries experienced still harder fate than Lobo and his companions many were put to death and the whole fraternity so completely extirpated that after many efforts all attempts to make a catholic people of the Abyssins were abandoned as chimerical and impracticable  The dissertations at the end of this work and which Johnson seems to estimate highly contain variety of information and controversial learning particularly respecting the difference between the church that sent the mission and that which received it and point out very clearly the inutility of endeavours founded on the principles of the Jesuits  Having completed this translation which I conjecture he was paid for by some bookseller of Birmingham who published it in an octavo volume Johnson in February left that place and returned to Lichfield from whence in the month of August following he issued a proposal soliciting a subscription to an edition of Politian's Poems  The proposal notifies that subscriptions would be taken in by N Nathanael Johnson who had succeeded to his father's business  with this title  'Angeli Politiani Poemata Latina quibus notas cum  Historia Latinae Poeseos a Petrarchae aevo ad Politiani tempora deducta et Vita Politiani fusius quam antehac enarrata addidit Sam Johnson'  The book was to be contained and printed in thirty octavo sheets and delivered at the price of five shillings but not meeting with sufficient encouragement Johnson dropped the design  From the above particulars it evidently appears that he had entertained a resolution to depend for a livelihood upon what he should be able either in the way of original composition or translation or in editing the works of celebrated authors to procure by his studies and in short to become an author by profession an occupation which though it may in some views of it be deemed mercenary as adapting itself to particular occasions and conjunctures nay to the interests passions and prejudices and even humours of mankind has yet some illustrious examples at least in our times to justify it It is true that many persons distinguish between those writings which are the effect of a natural impulse of genius and those other that owe their existence to interested motives and being the offspring of another parent may in some sense be said to be illegitimate but Johnson knew of no such distinction and would never acquiesce in it when made by others on the contrary I have more than once heard him assert that he knew of no genuine motive for writing other than necessity  In the prosecution of this his design he in the year made a tender of assistance to Cave the editor printer and publisher of the Gentleman's Magazine a man of whom I shall hereafter have  frequent occasion to speak The letter of Johnson to Cave on this occasion is yet extant and is here given as a literary curiosity  Nov  SIR  As you appear no less sensible than your readers of the defect of your poetical article you will not be displeased if in order to the improvement of it I communicate to you the sentiments of a person who will undertake on reasonable terms sometimes to fill a column  His opinion is that the public would not give you a bad reception if beside the current wit of the month which a critical examination would generally reduce to a narrow compass you admitted not only poems inscriptions c never printed before which he will sometimes supply you with but likewise short literary dissertations in Latin or English critical remarks on authors ancient or modern forgotten poems that deserve revival or loose pieces like Floyer's worth preserving By this method your Literary Article for so it might be called will he thinks be better recommended to the public than by low jests aukward buffoonery or the dull scurrilities of either party  If such a correspondence will be agreeable to you be pleased to inform me in two posts what the conditions are on which you shall expect it Your late offer  A prize of fifty pounds for the best poem  'on Life Death Judgment Heaven and Hell'  gives me no reason to distrust your generosity If you engage in any literary projects besides this  paper I have other designs to impart if I could be secure from having others reap the advantage of what I should hint  Your letter by being directed to S Smith to be left at the Castle in Birmingham Warwickshire will reach  Your humble servant  This letter and Cave's answer to it may serve to refute an assertion in an anonymous account of Johnson's life that he was introduced to the acquaintance of Cave by Savage  To this letter Cave returned an answer dated d December following wherein he accepted the services of Johnson and retained him as a correspondent and a contributor to his Magazine  This correspondence exhibits a view of the Gentleman's Magazine in its rudiments and may excite a curiosity in the patrons thereof to trace back to its origin the publication of a miscellany the fame whereof has extended itself to the most remote parts of the literary world Histories of the learned men of modern times and short abridgments of their works as also such pieces as for their brevity required some vehicle to convey them to posterity it has been the practice of foreign countries in their memoirs and of universities and academies in their acts and transactions to give The historical and memorable diurnal events of the passing times have also been recorded in publications variously denominated particularly in a work entitled the Political State of Great Britain beginning with the year and compiled by the well known Abel Boyer In this are contained debates and speeches in parliament and also abstracts of political  pamphlets but of a work that should comprehend intelligence of both these kinds we know of no exemplar in this country earlier than the year when an essay towards such a one was made in the publication of a book entitled The Historical Register containing an impartial relation of all transactions foreign and domestic by a body of men from whom few would have expected any thing of the kind In short the editors of the Historical Register were the members of a society associated about the year abovementioned for the purpose of insurance from fire which from the badge assumed by them obtained the denomination of the SunfireOffice and is still subsisting in a flourishing state One of the managing persons in this society was if my information misleads me not a man of the name of Povey who by the way was a great improver of that useful project the Penny Post  The original inventor thereof was one Mr Dockwra a citizen of such eminence that he stood for the office of Chamberlain against Sir Wm Fazakerley  and died within my memory Having a scheming head a plausible tongue and a ready pen he prevailed on his fellowmembers to undertake the above publication foreign as it was to the nature of their institution In Strype's continuation of Stow's Survey I find the following article respecting this society  'All persons taking out policies for insurance must pay two shillings and sixpence per quarter and besides their insurance shall have a book called the Historical Register left every quarter at their house'  The Historical Register gave also an account of the proceedings of Parliament the first volume contains  the speeches in both houses on the debate on the Septennial Bill but so great is the caution observed in drawing them up that none of those in the House of Lords are appropriated otherwise than by such words as these  'A noble Duke stood up and said' 'This speech was answered by a Northern Peer'  and other such vague designations In those in the House of Commons the names of the speakers Mr Shippen Mr Hampden Sir Richard Steele and others are given without any artifices of concealment  This publication was continued to the year inclusive and may be supposed to have been superseded by the Gentleman's Magazine which was then rising very fast in its reputation  From the Historical Register the hint was taken of a publication entitled The Grubstreet Journal  Mention is often made in the Dunciad and other modern books of Grubstreet writers and Grubstreet publications but the terms are little understood the following historical fact will explain them During the usurpation a prodigious number of seditions and libellous pamphlets and papers tending to exasperate the people and encrease the confusion in which the nation was involved were from time to time published The authors of these were for the most part men whose indigent circumstances compelled them to live in the suburbs and most obscure parts of the town Grubstreet then abounded with mean and old houses which were let out in lodgings at low rents to persons of this description whose occupation was the publishing anonymous treason and slander One of the original inhabitants of this street was Fox the Martyrologist who during his abode there wrote his Acts and Monuments It was also rendered famous by having been the dwellingplace of Mr Henry Welby a gentleman of whom it is related in a printed narrative that he lived there forty years without being seen of any  which besides a brief account of public occurrences contained criticisms and censures of dull and profane  or immoral books and pamphlets as also original essays and letters to the editors The chief conductors of it were Dr John Martyn then a young physician afterwards professor of botany in the university of Cambridge and Dr Russel also a physician the former assumed the name Bavius and the latter Maevius Its first publication was in January and it meeting with encouragement Cave projected an improvement thereon in a pamphlet of his own and in the following year gave to the world the first number of the Gentleman's Magazine with a notification that the same would be continued monthly incurring thereby a charge of plagiarism which as he is said to have confessed it we may suppose he did not look upon as criminal  Memoirs of the society of Grubstreet Preface page xii et seqq    Johnson had not by his letter herein before inserted so attached himself to Cave as not to be at liberty to enter into a closer engagement with any other person he therefore in made overtures to the Rev Mr Budworth then master of the grammar school at Brerewood in Staffordshire and who had been bred under Mr Blackwall at Market Bosworth to become his assistant but Mr Budworth thought himself under a necessity of declining them from an apprehension that those convulsive motions to which Johnson through life was subject might render him an object of imitation and possibly of ridicule with his pupils  It may be remembered that in a preceding page Johnson is said to have resided for some months in the year in the house of a person named  Jarvis at Birmingham To this circumstance by a conjecture not improbable may be referred an important event of his life At that time there dwelt at Birmingham a widow the relict of Mr Porter a mercer who dying left her if not well jointured so provided for as made a match with her to a man in Johnson's circumstances desirable report says she was rather advanced in years it is certain that she had a son and daughter grown up the former was in the last war a captain in the navy and his sister lately dead inherited from him a handsome fortune acquired in the course of a long service Of her personal charms little can now be remembered Johnson has celebrated them in an inscription on her tomb at Bromley but considering his infirmity and admitting the truth of a confession said to have been made by him that he never saw  'the human face divine'  it may be questioned whether himself was ever an eyewitness to them The inscription further declares her to have been of the family of Jarvis and gives colour to a supposition that she was either a sister or other relation of the Jarvis abovementioned  With this person he married his age being then about twentyseven Her fortune which is conjectured to have been about eight hundred pounds placed him in a state of affluence to which before he had been a stranger He was not so imprudent as to think it an inexhaustable mine on the contrary he reflected on the means of improving it His acquisitions at school and at the university and the improvement he had made of his talents in the study of the French and Italian languages qualified him in an eminent degree for an instructor of youth in classical literature  and the reputation of his father  d the connections he had formed in and about Lichfield pointed out to him a fair prospect of succeeding in that useful profession  There dwelt in the abovementioned city a very respectable gentleman Mr Gilbert Walmsley register of the ecclesiastical court of the bishop thereof to whose house in his school and also in his university vacations Johnson was a welcome guest the same person was also a friend of captain Garrick who had for some time been resident at Lichfield and by consequence of Mr David Garrick his son His character is so well pourtrayed by Johnson and represents in such lively colours his friendship for him that it would be injustice to omit the insertion of it as given in the life of Edmund Smith  'Of Gilbert Walmsley thus presented to my mind let me indulge myself in the remembrance I knew him very early he was one of the first friends that literature procured me and I hope that at least my gratitude made me worthy of his notice  'He was of an advanced age and I was only not a boy yet he never received my notions with contempt He was a whig with all the virulence and malevolence of his party yet difference of opinion did not keep us apart I honoured him and he endured me  'He had mingled with the gay world without exemption from its vices or its follies but had never neglected the cultivation of his mind his belie  of revelation was unshaken his learning preserved his principles he grew first regular and then pious  'His studies had been so various that I am not able to name a man of equal knowledge His acquaintance with books was great and what he did not immediately know he could at least tell where to find Such was his amplitude of learning and such his copiousness of communication that it may be doubted whether a day now passes in which I have not some advantage from his friendship  'At this man's table I enjoyed many chearful and instructive hours with companions such as are not often found with one who has lengthened and one who has gladdened life with Dr James whose skill in physic will be long remembered and with David Garrick whom I hoped to have gratified with this character of our common friend but what are the hopes of man I am disappointed by that stroke of death which has eclipsed the gaiety of nations and impoverished the public stock of harmless pleasure'  The benevolent person so gratefully remembered in the above encomium knowing the abilities of Johnson encouraged him in his design of becoming a teacher of literature he suggested to him the taking a large house situate in a place adjacent to Lichfield which however the name of it be spelt the common people call Edjal thither Johnson went and with him young Garrick who though he had been educated in Lichfield school and was then near eighteen years old having been diverted in the course of his studies by a call to Lisbon stood in need of improvement in the Latin and French languages  The placing Garrick under the tuition of Johnson was an act of Mr Walmsley's and resembles that  politic device of country housewives the placing one egg in the nest of a hen to induce her to lay more it succeeded so far as to draw from the families of the neighbouring gentry a few pupils and among the rest a son of Mr Offley of Staffordshire a name that for centuries past may be traced in the history and records of that county But so adverse were his fortunes in this early period that this wellplanned scheme of a settlement disappointed the hopes of Johnson and his friends for neither his own abilities nor the patronage of Mr Walmsley nor the exertions of Mrs Johnson and her relations succeeded farther than to produce an accession of about five or six pupils so that his number at no time exceeded eight and of those not all were boarders  After waiting a reasonable time in hopes of more pupils Johnson finding they came in but slowly had recourse to the usual method of raising a school In the year he advertised the instructing young gentlemen in the Greek and Latin languages by himself at his house describing it near Lichfield  The following is the advertisement which he published upon the occasion  'At Edial near Lichfield in Staffordshire young gentlemen are boarded and taught the Latin and Greek languages by SAMUEL JOHNSON'  Vide Gent Mag for Page  That this notification failed of its end we can scarce wonder if we reflect that he was little more than twentyseven years of age when he published it and that he had not the vanity to profess teaching all sciences nor the effrontery of those who in these more modern times undertake in private boardingschools to qualify young men for holy orders  By means of a paper which I have now before me I am able to furnish what I take to have been his method or plan of institution and as it may be deemed a curiosity and may serve the purpose of future instructors of youth I here insert it  When the introduction or formation of nouns and verbs is perfectly mastered the pupils learn  Corderius by Mr Clarke beginning at the same time to translate out of his introduction They then proceed to  Erasmus reading him with Clarke's translation These books form the first class  Class II  Read Eutropius and Cornelius Nepos or Justin with the translation The first class to repeat by memory in the morning the rules they had learned before and in the afternoon the Latin rules of the nouns and verbs They are also on Thursdays and Saturdays to be examined in the rules they have learned  The second class does the same while in Eutropius afterwards they are to get and repeat the irregular nouns and verbs and also the rules for making and scanning verses in which they are to be examined as the first class  Class III  Read Ovid's Metamorphoses in the morning and Caesar's Commentaries in the afternoon Continue the Latin rules till they are perfect in them Proceed then to Leeds's Greek Grammar and are examined as before  They then proceed to Virgil beginning at the same time to compose themes and verses  Johnson had through his life a propensity to Latin composition he shewed it very early at school and while there made some Latin verses for which the Earl of Berkshire who was a good scholar and had always a Horace in his pocket gave him a guinea  and learn Greek and from thence pass on to Horace Terence and Sallust The Greek authors afterwards read are first those in the Attic dialect which are Cebes Aelian Lucian by Leeds and Xenophon next Homer in the Ionic Theocritus Doric Euripides Attic and Doric  From two letters first inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine and since in sundry other publications from Mr Walmsley to his friend the reverend Mr Colson a mathematician and in his later years Lucasian professor at Cambridge little is to be learnt respecting the history of Johnson and Garrick at this period the one wants the date of the month the other that of the year and though in the order of their publication the one immediately follows the other there must have been some interval between the times of writing the first and the last The first is dated in and as it contains a recommendation of Garrick to Mr Colson for instruction in mathematics philosophy and human learning leads us to suppose that before the time of writing it Johnson's scheme of taking in boarders had proved abortive The latter written in what year we know not and inserted below recommends both Johnson and Garrick to his notice the former as a good scholar and one that gave hopes  of turning out a fine tragedywriter and we are from good authority assured that in March in the year last abovementioned they on horseback arrived in town together  Lichfield  March  Dear Sir  I had the favour of yours and am extremely obliged to you but cannot say I had a greater affection for you upon it than I had before being long since so much endeared to you as well by an early friendship as by your many excellent and valuable qualifications And had I a son of my own it would be my ambition instead of sending him to the university to dispose of him as this young gentleman is  He and another neighbour of mine one Mr S Johnson set out this morning for London together Davy Garrick is to be with you early the next week and Mr Johnson to try his fate with a tragedy and to see to get himself employed in some translation either from the Latin or the French Johnson is a very good scholar and a poet and I have great hopes will turn out a fine tragedywriter If it should any ways lay in your way doubt not but you would be ready to recommend and assist your countryman  G WALMSLEY  The hope suggested in this letter is grounded on a circumstance which will lead us back to about the year before he quitted his school at Edial It must be imagined the instruction of so small a number of scholars as were under his care left him at leisure to pursue his  private studies and amusements which for the most part consisted in desultory reading Let it not excite wonder in any that shall peruse these memoirs to be told that Burton on Melancholy was a book that he frequently resorted to for the purpose of exhilaration or that at times he should find entertainment in turning over Knolles's voluminous and neglected history of the Turks In the many hours of leisure which he may be said rather to have endured than enjoyed we must suppose some employed in the contemplation of his fortunes the means of improving them and of resisting the adverse accidents to which human life is exposed and of which he had already had some experience The stage holds forth temptations to men of genius which many have been glad to embrace the profits arising from a tragedy including the representation and printing of it and the connections it sometimes enables the author to form were in Johnson's idea inestimable and it is not impossible but that Garrick who before this time had manifested a propensity towards the stage had suggested to him the thought of writing one certain it is that during his residence at Edial and under the eye of his friend Mr Walmsley he planned and completed that poem which gave this gentleman occasion to say he was likely to become a fine tragedywriter  He chose for his story an action related by Knolles in his history abovementioned with all the powers of the most affecting eloquence to give it at large would be to transgress the limits I have prescribed myself and to abridge it would injure it I will do neither but referring the reader to the historian himself will relate it as a bare historical fact  Mahomet the Great first emperor of the Turks in the year laid siege to the city of Constantinople then possessed by the Greeks and after an obstinate resistance took and sacked it Among the many young women whom his commanders thought fit to lay hands on and present to him was one named Irene a Greek of incomparable beauty and such rare perfection of body and mind that the emperor becoming enamoured of her neglected the care of his government and empire for two whole years and thereby so exasperated the Janizaries and other of his warlike subjects that they mutinied and threatened to dethrone him To prevent this mischief Mustapha Bassa a person of great credit with him undertook to represent to him the great danger to which he lay exposed by the indulgence of his passion he called to his remembrance the characters actions and atchievements of many of his predecessors and the state of his government and in short so roused him from his lethargy that he took a horrible resolution to silence the clamours of his people by the sacrifice of this admirable creature accordingly on a future day he commanded her to be dressed and adorned in the richest manner that she and her attendants could devise and against a certain hour issued orders for the nobility and leaders of his army to attend him in the great hall of his palace When they were all assembled himself appeared with great pomp and magnificence leading his late captive but now absolute mistress by the hand unconscious of guilt and ignorant of his design With a furious and menacing look he gave the beholders to understand that he knew the cause of their discontent and that he meant  to remove it but bade them first view that lady whom he still held with his left hand and say whether any of them being possessed of a jewel so rare and precious a woman so lovely and fair would for any cause forego her to which they answered that he had great reason for his affection towards her  To this the emperor replied that this being their opinion he would convince them that his actions were in his own power and that he was yet master of himself  'And having so said' says my author 'presently with one of his hands catching the fair Greek by the hair of the head and drawing his falchion with the other he at one blow struck off her head to the great terror of them all and having so done said unto them  "Now by this judge whether your emperor is able to bridle his affections or not"  Two tragedies founded on this story had already appeared before Johnson conceived his intention of producing a third The former of these was written by Gilbert Swinhoe  Esq  a native of Northumberland who lived temp Car I Car II and was published in to with the title of Unhappy Fair Irene her Tragedy See Langbaine's Account of Dramatic Poets edit p Of the latter entitled Irene or the Fair Greek to one Charles Goring  Esq  supposed to be the same person with one of that name who was of Magdalen college Oxford and in took the degree of Master of Arts was the author See Biographia Dramatica art Goring Charles  Esq  It no where appears that in this journey to London Mrs Johnson was one of the company it is rather to be conjectured that her husband having abandoned the hope of succeeding in his attempt to raise a school left to her the care of the house and the management of the small part of her fortune which after the fitting  up and furnishing the same together with two years' expenditure must be supposed to be left and that this could be no other than small may be inferred from her natural temper which it is said was as little disposed to parsimony as that of her husband  It is not my intention to pursue the history of Mr Garrick's progress in life both because I have not taken upon me to be his biographer and because the principal events of it occur in the memoirs of him written with great candour and I dare say truth by Mr Thomas Davies and by him published in two volumes octavo but the course of this narration requires me occasionally to mention such particulars concerning him as in any manner connect him with the subject I am engaged in and this leads me to mention a fact concerning them both that I had from a person now living who was a witness to it and of whose veracity the least doubt cannot be entertained They had been but a short time in London before the stock of money that each set out with was nearly exhausted and though they had not like the prodigal son  'wasted their substance in riotous living'  they began like him  'to be in want'  In this extremity Garrick suggested the thought of obtaining credit from a tradesman whom he had a slight knowledge of Mr Wilcox a bookseller in the Strand to him they applied and representing themselves to him as they really were two young men friends and travellers from the same place and just arrived with a view to settle here he was so moved with their artless tale that on their joint note he advanced them all that their modesty would permit them to ask five pounds which was soon after punctually repaid  It has been before related that Johnson had engaged his pen in the service of Cave as it seems under some fictitious name perhaps that common one of Smith which he directs Cave to address him by in his letter of th Nov Being now come to town and determined or rather constrained to rely on the labour of his brain for support he to improve the correspondence he had formed thought proper to discover himself and in his real name to communicate to Cave a project which he had formed and which the following letter will explain  Greenwich next door to the GoldenHeart Churchstreet  July  SIR  Having observed in your papers very uncommon offers of encouragement to men of letters I have chosen being a stranger in London to communicate to you the following design which I hope if you join in it will be of advantage to both of us  The history of the Council of Trent having been lately translated into French and published with large notes by Dr Le Courayer the reputation of that book is so much revived in England that it is presumed a new translation of it from the Italian together with Le Courayer's notes from the French could not fail of a favourable reception  If it be answered that the history is already in English it must be remembered that there was the same objection against Le Courayer's undertaking with this disadvantage that the French had a version by one of their best translators whereas  you cannot read three pages of the English history without discovering that the style is capable of great improvements but whether those improvements are to be expected from this attempt you must judge from the specimen which if you approve the proposal I shall submit to your examination  Suppose the merit of the versions equal we may hope that the addition of the notes will turn the balance in our favour considering the reputation of the Annotator  Be pleased to favour me with a speedy answer if you are not willing to engage in this scheme and appoint me a day to wait on you if you are  I am Sir your humble servant SAM JOHNSON  Cave's acquiescence in the above proposal drew Johnson into a close intimacy with him he was much at St John's Gate and taught Garrick the way thither Cave had no great relish for mirth but he could bear it and having been told by Johnson that his friend had talents for the theatre and was come to London with a view to the profession of an actor expressed a wish to see him in some comic character Garrick readily complied and as Cave himself told me with a little preparation of the room over the great arch of St John's gate and with the assistance of a few journeymen printers who were called together for the purpose of reading the other parts represented with all the graces of comic humor the principal character in Fielding's farce of the MockDoctor  Cave's temper was phlegmatic though he assumed as the publisher of the Magazine the name of Sylvanus Urban he had few of those qualities that constitute the character of urbanity Judge of his want of them by this question which he once put to an author  'Mr I hear you have just published a pamphlet and am told there is a very good paragraph in it upon the subject of music did you write that yourself'  His discernment was also slow and as he had already at his command some writers of prose and verse who in the language of booksellers are called good hands  Mr Moses Browne originally a pencutter was so far as concerned the poetical part of it the chief support of the Magazine which he fed with many a nourishing morsel This person being a lover of angling wrote piscatory eclogues and was a candidate for the fifty pound prize mentioned in Johnson's first letter to Cave and for other prizes which Cave engaged to pay him who should write the best poem on certain subjects in all or most of which competitions Mr Browne had the good fortune to succeed He published these and other poems of his writing in an octavo volume Lond and has therein given proofs of an exuberant fancy and a happy invention Some years after he entered into holy orders A farther account of him may be seen in the Biographia Dramatica to a place in which work he seems to have acquired a title by some juvenile compositions for the stage Being a person of a religious turn he also published in verse a series of devout contemplations called Sunday Thoughts Johnson who often expressed his dislike of religious poetry and who for the purpose of religious meditation seemed to think one day as proper as another read them with cold approbation and said he had a great mind to write and publish Monday Thoughts  To the proofs above adduced of the coarseness of Cave's manners let me add the following he had undertaken at his own risque to publish a translation of Du Halde's History of China in which were contained sundry geographical and other plates Each of these he inscribed to one or other of his friends and among the rest one  '  To Moses Browne  '  With this blunt and familiar designation of his person Mr Browne was justly offended to appease him Cave directed an engraver to introduce with a caret under the line  Mr  and thought that in so doing he had made ample amends to Mr Browne for the indignity done him  Mr John Duick also a pencutter and a near neighbour of Cave was a frequent contributor to the Magazine of short poems written with spirit and ease He was a kinsman of Browne and the author of a good copy of encomiastic verses prefixed to the collection of Browne's poems abovementioned  Mr Foster Webb a young man who had received his education in Mr Watkins's academy in Spitalsquare and afterwards became clerk to a merchant in the city was at first a contributor to the Magazine of enigmas a species of poetry in which he then delighted but was dissuaded from it by the following lines which appeared in the Magazine for October after a few successful essays in that kind of writing  Too modest bard with enigmatic veil  No longer let thy muse her charms conceal  Though oft the Sun in clouds his face disguise  Still he looks nobler when he gilds the skies  Do thou like him avow thy native flame  Burst thro' the gloom and brighten into fame  After this friendly exhortation Mr Webb in those hours of leisure which business afforded amused himself with translating from the Latin classics particularly Ovid and Horace from the latter of these he rendered into English verse with better success than any that had before attempted it the odes  'Quis multa gracilis te puer in rosa' 'Solvitur acris hyems grata vice veris Favoni' 'Parcus Deorum cultor infrequens' and 'Diffugêre nives redeunt jam gramina campis'  all which are inserted in Cave's Magazine His signature was sometimes Telarius at others Vedastus He was a modest ingenious and sober young man but a consumption defeated the hopes of his friends and took him off in the twentysecond year of his age  Mr John Smith another of Mr Watkins's pupils was a writer in the Magazine of prose essays chiefly on religious and moral subjects and died of a decline about the same time  Mr John Canton apprentice to the abovenamed Mr Watkius and also his successor in his academy was a contributor to the Magazine of verses and afterwards of papers on philosophical and mathematical subjects The discoveries he made in electricity and magnetism are well known and are recorded in the transactions of the Royal Society of which he afterwards became a member  Mr William Rider bred in the same prolific seminary was a writer in the Magazine of verses signed Philargyrus He went from school to Jesus college Oxford and some years after his leaving the same entered into holy orders and became surmaster of St Paul's school in which office he continued many years but at length was obliged to quit that employment by reason of his deafness  Mr Adam Calamy a son of Dr Edmund Calamy an eminent nonconformist divine and author of the Abridgment of Mr Baxter's History of his Life and Times was another of Mr Watkins's pupils that wrote in the Magazine the subjects on which he chiefly exercised his pen were essays in polemical theology and republican politics and he distinguished them by the assumed signature of  '  A consistent protestant  '  He was bred to the profession of an attorney and was brother to Mr Edmund Calamy a dissenting teacher of eminence for his worth and learning  A seminary of a higher order than that abovementioned viz the academy of Mr John Eames in Moorfields furnished the Magazine with a number of other correspondents in mathematics and other branches of science and polite literature This was an institution supported by the Dissenters the design whereof was to qualify young men for their ministry Mr Eames was formerly the continuator of the abridgement of the Philosophical Transactions begun by Jones and Lowthorp and was a man of great knowledge and a very able tutor Under him were bred many young men who afterwards became eminently distinguished for learning and abilities among them were the late Mr Parry of Cirencester the late Dr Furneaux and Dr Gibbons and if I mistake not the present Dr Price The pupils of this academy had heads that teemed with knowledge which as fast as they acquired it they were prompted by a juvenile and laudable ambition to communicate in letters to Mr Urban  To this account of Cave's correspondents might be added the celebrated names of Dr Birch who will be spoken of hereafter Mrs Carter Dr Akenside the Rev Mr Samuel Pegge who by an ingenious transposition of the letters of his name formed the plausible signature of Paul Gemsege Mr Luck of Barnstaple in Devonshire Mr Henry Price of Pool in Dorsetshire Mr Richard Yate of Chively in Shropshire Mr John Bancks and that industrious and prolific genius Mr John Lockman  he was the backwarder in making  advances or courting an intimacy with Johnson Upon the first approach of a stranger his practice was to continue sitting a posture in which he was ever to be found and for a few minutes to continue silent  if at any time he was inclined to begin the discourse it was generally by putting a leaf of the Magazine then in the press into the hand of his visitor and asking his opinion of it I remember that calling in on  him once he gave me to read the beautiful poem of Collins written for Shakespeare's Cymbeline  'To fair Fidele's grassy tomb'  which though adapted to a particular circumstance in the play Cave was for inserting in his Magazine without any reference to the subject I told him it would lose of its beauty if it were so published this he could not see nor could he be convinced of the propriety of the name Fidele he thought Pastora a better and so printed it  He was so incompetent a judge of Johnson's abilities that meaning at one time to dazzle him with the splendor of some of those luminaries in literature who favoured him with their correspondence he told him that if he would in the evening be at a certain alehouse in the neighbourhood of Clerkenwell he might have a chance of seeing Mr Browne and another or  two of the persons mentioned in the preceding note Johnson accepted the invitation and being introduced by Cave dressed in a loose horseman's coat and such a great bushy uncombed wig as he constantly wore to the sight of Mr Browne whom he found sitting at the upper end of a long table in a cloud of tobaccosmoke had his curiosity gratified  Johnson saw very clearly those offensive particulars that made a part of Cave's character but as he was one of the most quicksighted men I ever knew in discovering the good and amiable qualities of others a faculty which he has displayed as well in the life of Cave as in that of Savage printed among his works so was he ever inclined to palliate their defects and though he was above courting the patronage of a man whom for many reasons he could not but hold cheap he disdained not to accept it when tendered with any degree of complacency  And this was the general tenor of Johnson's behaviour for though his character through life was marked with a roughness that approached to ferocity it was in the power of almost every one to charm him into mildness and to render him gentle and placid and even courteous by such a patient and respectful attention as is due to every one who in his discourse signifies a desire either to instruct or delight Bred to no profession without relations friends or interest Johnson was an adventurer in the wide world and had his fortunes to make the arts of insinuation and address were in his opinion too slow in their operation to answer his purpose and he rather chose to display his parts to all the world at the risque of being thought arrogant than to wait for the assistance  of such friends as he could make or the patronage of some individual that had power or influence and who might have the kindness to take him by the hand and lift him into notice With all that asperity of manners with which he has been charged and which kept at a distance many who to my knowledge would have been glad of an intimacy with him he possessed the affections of pity and compassion in a most eminent degree In a mixed company of which I was one the conversation turned on the pestilence which raged in London in the year and gave occasion to Johnson to speak of Dr Nathanael Hodges who in the height of that calamity continued in the city and was almost the only one of his profession that had the courage to oppose the endeavours of his art to the spreading of the contagion It was the hard fate of this person a short time after to die a prisoner for debt in Ludgate Johnson related this circumstance to us with the tears ready to start from his eyes and with great energy said  'Such a man would not have been suffered to perish in these times'  It seems by the event of this first expedition that Johnson came to London for little else than to look about him it affored him no opportunity of forming connections either valuable in themselves or available to any future purpose of his life Mr Pope had seen and commended his translation of the Messiah but Johnson had not the means of access to him and being a stranger to his person his spirit would not permit him to solicit so great a favour from one who must be supposed to have been troubled with such kind of applications With one person however he commenced an intimacy the motives to which at first  view may probably seem harder to be accounted for than any one particular in his life This person was Mr Richard Savage whose misfortunes together with his vices had driven him to St John's gate and thereby introduced him to the acquaintance of Johnson which founded on his part in compassion soon improved into friendship and a mutual communication of sentiments and counsels The history of this man is well known by the life of him written by Johnson which if in no other respect valuable is curious in that it gives to view a character selfformed as owing nothing to parental nurture and scarce any thing to moral tuition and describes a mind in which as in a neglected garden weeds without the least obstruction were suffered to grow into luxuriance nature had endowed him with fine parts and those he cultivated as well as he was able but his mind had received no moral culture and for want thereof we find him to have been a stranger to humility gratitude and those other virtues that tend to conciliate the affections of men and insure the continuance of friendship  It may be conjectured that Johnson was captivated by the address and demeanour of Savage at his first approach for it must be noted of him that though he was always an admirer of genteel manners he a  this time had not been accustomed to the conversation of gentlemen and Savage as to his exterior was to a remarkable degree accomplished he was a handsome wellmade man and very courteous in the modes o  salutation I have been told that in the taking off hi  hat and disposing it under his arm and in his bow h  displayed as much grace as those actions were capabl  of and that he understood the exercise of a gentle+man's  weapon may be inferred from the use he made of it in that rash encounter which is related in his life and to which his greatest misfortunes were owing These accomplishments and the ease and pleasantry of his conversation were probably the charms that wrought on Johnson and hid from his view those baser qualities of Savage with which as his historian he has nevertheless been necessitated to mark his character The similarity of their circumstances might farther conduce to beget an unreserved confidence in each other they had both felt the pangs of poverty and the want of patronage Savage had let loose his resentment against the possessors of wealth in a collection of poems printed about the year and Johnson was ripe for an avowal of the same sentiments they seemed both to agree in the vulgar opinion that the world is divided into two classes of men of merit without riches and men of wealth without merit never considering the possibility that both might concenter in the same person just as when in the comparison of women we say that virtue is of more value than beauty we forget that many are possessed of both  In speculations of this kind and a mutual condolence of their fortunes they passed many a melancholy hour and those at a time when it might be supposed the reflection on them had made repose desirable on the contrary that very reflection is known to have interrupted it Johnson has told me that whole nights have been spent by him and Savage in conversations of this kind not under the hospitable roof of a tavern where warmth might have invigorated their spirits and wine dispelled their care but in a perambulation round the squares of Westminster St James's in  particular when all the money they could both raise was less than sufficient to purchase for them the shelter and fordid comforts of a night cellar  Of the result of their conversations little can now be known save that they gave rise to those principles of patriotism that both for some years after avowed they both with the same eye saw or believed they saw that the then minister meditated the ruin of this country that excise laws standing armies and penal statutes were the means by which he meant to effect it and at the risque of their liberty they were bent to oppose his measures but Savage's spirit was broken by the sense of his indigence and the pressure of those misfortunes which his imprudence had brought on him and Johnson was left alone to maintain the contest  The character and manners of Savage were such as leave us little room to think that Johnson could profit by his conversation whatever were his parts and accomplishments he had no reading and could furnish no intelligence to such a mind as Johnson's his vagrant course of life had made him acquainted with the town and its vices and though I am not warranted to say that Johnson was infected with them I have reason to think that he reflected with as little approbation on the hours he spent with Savage as on any period of his life  Doubtless there is in the example and conversation of some men a power that fascinates and suspends the operation of our own will to this power in Savage which consisted in the gentleness of his manners the elegance of his discourse and the vivacity of his imagination we must attribute the ascendant which he maintained over the affections of  Johnson and the inability of the latter to pursue the suggestions of his own superior understanding To the purpose of this sentiment I am tempted to relate a fact which Mr Garrick once communicated to me in conversation who speaking of the irresistible charm of engaging manners told me that being an actor at Drurylane theatre under Mr Fleetwood the patentee thereof whose extravagances rendered him incapable of fulfilling his engagements his salary became deeply in arrear and he began to feel the want of money in answer to his many applications for payment he had obtained promises and even oaths but these had been so often broken that pressed by necessity and provoked by ill usage he was determined to have recourse to law for payment he however thought it but right to declare his intention and for that purpose invited himself to breakfast with Fleetwood  'It was on a Sunday' said Mr Garrick 'that he appointed to see me he received me with great courtesy and affability and entertained me for some hours with discourse foreign to the subject of our meeting but so bewitching in its kind that it deprived me of the power of telling him that he owed me six hundred pounds and that my necessities compelled me to demand it'  The intimacy between Savage and Johnson continued till the beginning of the year when the distresses of the former and the cessation by the death of Queen Caroline of a pension which for some years she had directed to be paid him moved some of his friends to a subscription for his support in a place so far distant from the metropolis as to be out of the reach of its temptations where he might beget  new habits and indulge himself in those exercises of his imagination which had been the employment of his happiest hours The place fixed on for his residence was Swansea in Wales but as it was some time before the subscription could be completed his retirement thither was retarded  In this suspense of Savage's fortunes Johnson seems to have confirmed himself in a resolution of quarrelling with the administration of public affairs and becoming a satirist on the manners of the times and because he thought he saw a resemblance between his own and those of Rome in its decline he chose to express his sense of modern depravity by an imitation of the third satire of Juvenal in which with great judgment and no less asperity he drew a parallel between the corruptions of each and exemplified it by characters then subsisting In it he anticipated the departure of his friend Thales i e Savage whom he describes as  resolv'd from vice and London far  To breathe in distant fields a purer air  And fix'd in Cambria's solitary shore  Give to St David one true Briton more  To this exercise of his talent he was probably excited by the success of Mr Pope who had done the same by some of the satires of Horace and had vindicated by the example of Dr Donne a divine that species of writing even in Christian times from the imputation of malevolence and the want of that charity  'which is not easily provoked and endureth all things'  The poem was finished as appears by a manuscript note of the author in his own corrected copy in While he was writing it he lodged in an upper room of a house in Exeter street behind Exeter 'change inhabited by one Norris a staymaker a particular which would have been hardly worth noticing but that it in some measure bespeaks his circumstances at the time and accounts for his having more than once mentioned in the poem and that with seeming abhorrence the dungeons of the Strand It is not unlikely that his aversion to such an abode was increased by the reflection on that distress which by this time had brought his wife to town and obliged her to participate in the inconveniences of a dwelling too obscure to invite resort and to be a witness of the difficulties with which he was struggling  Having completed his poem he looked round for a bookseller to whom with a likelihood of obtaining the value of it he might treat for the sale of it His friend Cave in respect of publications was a haberdasher of small wares the greatest of his undertakings being a translation of Du Halde's History of China which was never completed  Johnson thinking him a man for his purpose made him an offer of his poem in a letter in which with great art but without the least violation of truth he conceals that himself was the author of it The letter I here insert as also another of his on the same subject  SIR  When I took the liberty of writing to you a few days ago I did not expect a repetition of the same  pleasure so soon for a pleasure I shall always think it to converse in any manner with an ingenious and candid man but having the inclosed poem in my hands to dispose of for the benefit of the author of whose abilities I shall say nothing since I send you his performance I believed I could not procure more advantageous terms from any person than from you who have so much distinguished yourself by your generous encouragement of poetry and whose judgment of that art nothing but your commendation of my trifle can give me any occasion to call in question I do not doubt but you will look over this poem with another eye and reward it in a different manner from a mercenary bookseller who counts the lines he is to purchase and considers nothing but the bulk I cannot help taking notice that besides what the author may hope for on account of his abilities he has likewise another claim to your regard as he lies at present under very disadvantageous circumstances of fortune I beg therefore that you will favour me with a letter tomorrow that I may know what you can afford to allow him that he may either part with it to you or find out which I do not expect some other way more to his satisfaction  I have only to add that I am sensible I have transcribed it very coarsely which after having altered it I was obliged to do I will if you please to transmit the sheets from the press correct it for you and will take the trouble of altering any stroke of satire which you may dislike  By exerting on this occasion your usual generosity you will not only encourage learning and relieve  distress but though it be in comparison of the other motives of very small account oblige in a very sensible manner Sir  Your very humble servant SAM JOHNSON  Monday No Castlestreet  SIR  I am to return you thanks for the present you were so kind to send me and to intreat that you will be pleased to inform me by the PennyPost whether you resolve to print the poem If you please to send it me by the post with a note to Dodsley I will go and read the lines to him that we may have his consent to put his name in the title page As to the printing if it can be set immediately about I will be so much the author's friend as not to content myself with mere solicitations in his favour I propose if my calculation be near the truth to engage for the reimbursement of all that you shall lose by an impression of provided as you very generously propose that the profit if any be set aside for the author's use excepting the present you made which if he be a gainer it is fit he should repay I beg you will let one of your servants write an exact account of the expence of such an impression and send it with the poem that I may know what I engage for I am very sensible from your generosity on this occasion of your regard to learning even in its unhappiest state and cannot but think such a temper deserving of the gratitude of those who suffer so often from a contrary disposition  I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON  Johnson and Dodsley were soon agreed the price asked by the one and assented to by the other was as I have been informed fifty pounds a reward for his labour and ingenuity that induced Johnson ever after to call Dodsley his patron It is pretty certain that in his offer of the poem to Dodsley Cave stipulated for the printing of it for it came abroad in the year abovementioned with the name of Cave as the printer though without that of the author Lord Lyttelton the instant it was published carried it in rapture to Mr Pope who having read it commended it highly and was very importunate with Dodsley to know the author's name but that being a secret the latter was bound not to reveal Pope assured him that he could not long be unknown recollecting perhaps a passage recorded of Milton who seeing a beautiful young lady pass him whom he never had seen before turned to look at her and said  'Whoever thou art thou canst not long be concealed'  The topics of this spirited poem so far as it respects this country or the time when it was written are evidently drawn from those weekly publications which to answer the view of a malevolent faction first created and for some years supported a distinction between the interests of the government and the people under the several denominations of the court and the country parties these publications were carried on under the direction of men professing themselves to be whigs and friends of the people in a paper intitled  'The Country Journal or the Craftsman'  now deservedly forgotten the end whereof was to blow the flame of national discontent to delude the honest and wellmeaning people of this country into a belief that the minister  was its greatest enemy and that his opponents only meant its welfare To this end it was necessary to furnish them with subjects of complaint and these were plentifully disseminated among them the chief of them were that science was unrewarded and the arts neglected that the objects of our politics were peace and the extension of commerce that the wealth of the nation was unequally divided for that while some were poor others were able to raise palaces and purchase manors that restraints were laid on the stage that the land was plundered and the nation cheated our senators hirelings and our nobility venal and lastly that in his visits to his native country the king drained this of its wealth  That Johnson has adopted these vulgar complaints his poem must witness I shall not take upon me to demonstrate the fallacy of most of the charges contained in it nor animadvert on the wickedness of those who to effect their own ambitious designs scruple not to oppose the best endeavours of the person in power nor shall I mark the folly of those who suffer themselves to be so deluded the succession of knave to knave and fool to fool is hereditary and interminable our fathers were deceived by the pretensions of false patriots the delusion stopped not with their children nor will it with our's  The publication of this poem was of little advantage to Johnson other than the relief of his immediate wants it procured him fame but no patronage He was therefore disposed to embrace any other prospect of advantage that might offer for a short time after viz in August hearing that the mastership  of Appleby school in Leicestershire was become vacant he by the advice of Sir Thomas Griesly a Derbyshire baronet and other friends went to Appleby and offered himself as a candidate for that employment but the statutes of the school requiring that the person chosen should be a Master of Arts his application was checked To get over this difficulty he found means to obtain from the late Lord Gower a letter to a friend of his soliciting his interest with Dean Swift towards procuring him a master's degree from the university of Dublin the letter has appeared in print but with a mistaken date of the year viz for it mentions Johnson's being the author of the poem of  'London'  which as I have above fixed it was written in It is as follows  SIR  Mr Samuel Johnson author of London a satire and some other poetical pieces is a native of this country and much respected by some worthy gentlemen in his neighbourhood who are trustees of a charity school now vacant the certain salary of which is l per year of which they are desirous to make him master but unfortunately he is not capable of receiving their bounty which would make him happy for life by not being a Master of Arts which by the statutes of this school the master of it must be  Now these gentlemen do me the honour to think that I have interest enough in you to prevail upon you to write to Dean Swift to persuade the university of Dublin to send a diploma to me constituting this poor man Master of Arts in their university They  highly extol the man's learning and probity and will not be persuaded that the university will make any difficulty of conferring such a favour upon a stranger if he is recommended by the Dean They say he is not afraid of the strictest examination though he is of so long a journey and will venture it if the Dean thinks it necessary choosing rather to die upon the road than to be starved to death in translating for booksellers which has been his only subsistence for some time past  I fear there is more difficulty in this affair than these goodnatured gentlemen apprehend especially as their election cannot be delayed longer than the th of next month If you see this matter in the same light that it appears to me I hope you will burn this and pardon me for giving you so much trouble about an impracticable thing but if you think there is a probability of obtaining the favour asked I am sure your humanity and propensity to relieve merit in distress will incline you to serve the poor man without my adding any more to the trouble I have already given you than assuring you that I am with great truth  Sir  Your faithful humble servant GOWER  Trentham  August  If ever Johnson had reason to lament the shortness of his stay at the university it was now The want of an honour which after a short efflux of years is conferred almost of course was at this crisis his greatest misfortune it stood between him and the acquisition of an income of l a year in a country and at a  time that made it equivalent to a much larger sum at present  The letter of Lord Gower failing of its effect Johnson returned to London resolving on a vigorous effort to supply his wants this was a translation into English of Father Paul's History of the Council of Trent  Vide Gent Mag for Jan page  the former by Sir Nathaniel Brent though a faithful one being in the judgment of some persons rather obsolete Johnson was well enough skilled in the Italian language for the undertaking and was encouraged to it by many of his friends as namely Mr Walmsley Mr Caslon the letterfounder Mr afterwards Dr Birch and others but he chose to make it a joint project and take Cave into the adventure who as the work proceeded advanced him small sums at two or three guineas a week amounting together to near fifty pounds  Proposals for publishing it were advertised in the Weekly Miscellany of st Oct in the following terms  'Just published proposals for printing the History of the Council of Trent translated from the Italian of Father Paul Sarpi with the author's life and notes Theological Historical and Critical from the French edition of Dr Le Courayer To which are added observations on the history and notes and illustrations from various authors both printed and manuscript by S Johnson in two volumes quarto'  It happened at this time that another person of the same christian and surname the then keeper of Dr Tenison's library in St Martin's parish had engaged in the like design and was supported therein by Dr Zachary Pearce and also by most of the bishops and by many of the dignified clergy which being the case the solicitations in behalf of the two versions crossed  each other and rendered both abortive Twelve quarto sheets of Johnson's were printed off but what became of the other is not known This disappointment however mortifying did not hinder Johnson from prosecuting a part of his original design and writing the life of the author which with the assistance of a life of him written by an Italian nobleman whose name I could never learn and published in a closely printed duodecimo he was enabled to complete and in an abridgment to insert in Cave's Magazine  Various other projects about this time did he form of publications on literary subjects which in a subsequent page by the help of a list in his own handwriting I have enumerated but they were either blasted by other publications of a similar nature or abandoned for want of encouragement  However that he might not be totally unemployed Cave engaged him to undertake a translation of an Examen of Pope's Essay on Man written by Mr Crousaz a professor in Switzerland who had acquired some eminence by a treatise on Logic of his writing and also by his Examen de Pyrrhonisme and of whom Johnson after observing that he was no mean antagonist has given this character  'His mind was one of those in which philosophy and piety are happily united He was accustomed to argument and disquisition and perhaps was grown too desirous of detecting faults but his intention was always right his opinions were solid and his religion pure His incessant vigilance for the promotion of piety disposed him to look with distrust upon all metaphysical systems of Theology and all schemes of virtue and happiness purely rational and therefore it was not long  before he was persuaded that the positions of Pope as they terminated for the most part in natural religion were intended to draw mankind away from Revelation and to represent the whole course of things as a necessary concatenation of indissoluble fatality and it is undeniable that in many passages a religious eye may easily discover expressions not very favourable to morals or to liberty'  Life of Pope among the poets  The reputation of the Essay on Man soon after its publication invited a translation of it into French which was undertaken and completed by the Abbé Resnel and falling into the hands of Crousaz drew from him first a general censure of the principles maintained in the poem and afterwards a commentary thereon containing particular remarks on every paragraph The former of these it was that Johnson translated as appears by the following letter of his to Cave which is rendered somewhat remarkable by his stiling himself  Impransus  Dear SIR  I am pretty much of your opinion that the Commentary cannot be prosecuted with any appearance of success for as the names of the authors concerned are of more weight in the performance than its own intrinsic merit the public will be soon satisfied with it And I think the Examen should be pushed forward with the utmost expedition Thus This day c An Examen of Mr Pope's essay c containing a succinct account of the philosophy of Mr Leibnitz on the system of the Fatalists with a  confutation of their opinions and an illustration of the doctrine of Freewill with what else you think proper  It will above all be necessary to take notice that it is a thing distinct from the Commentary  I was so far from imagining they the compositors stood still that I conceived them to have a good deal beforehand and therefore was less anxious in providing them more But if ever they stand still on my account it must doubtless be charged to me and whatever else will be reasonable I shall not oppose but beg a suspense of judgment till morning when I must intreat you to send me a dozen proposals and you shall then have copy to spare  I am Sir your's  impransus  SAM JOHNSON  Johnson's translation of the Examen was printed by Cave and came abroad but without a name in November bearing the title of  'An Examination of Mr Pope's Essay on Man containing a succinct view of the system of the Fatalists and a confutation of their opinions with an illustration of the doctrine of FreeWill and an enquiry what view Mr Pope might have in touching upon the Leibnitzian Philosophy and Fatalism By Mr Crousaz professor of Philosophy and Mathematics at Lausanne c'  All the world knows that the Essay on Man was composed from the dictamen of Lord Bolingbroke and it is little less notorious that Pope was but meanly skilled in that sort of learning to which the subject of his poem related he had not been conversant with the writings or opinions of the different sects of philosophers  of whom some maintained and others denied the freedom of the will and knew little more of the arguments for and against human liberty in opposition to what is called Necessity than he was able to gather from the controversy between Anthony Collins and his opponents or that between Dr Clarke and Leibnitz He was therefore unable to defend what he had written and stood a dead mark for his adversaries to shoot at Fortunate for him it was that at this crisis there was living such a person as Mr Warburton and Pope had for all the remainder of his life reason to reflect with pleasure on the accident that brought them acquainted and which I will presently relate  Warburton's origin and rise into literary reputation are pretty well known He had served a clerkship to an attorney the townclerk of Newark upon Trent and for a short time was himself a practiser in that profession but having a strong propensity to learning he determined to quit it and pursue a course of study such as was necessary to qualify him for the ministerial function and having completed it got admitted into holy orders and settled in London where upon his arrival he became acquainted with some of the inferior wits Concannen Theobald and others the enemies of Pope and adopted many of their sentiments In a letter to the former of these he writes  'Dryden I observe borrows for want of leisure and Pope for want of genius Milton out of pride and Addison out of modesty'  further he assisted Theobald with notes on many passages in his edition of Shakespeare which charge Mr Pope with ignorance and incapacity for the office of an editor  But leaving literal criticism to these his first associates Warburton betook himself to studies of greater importance and before the publication of the Examen of the Essay on Man had made himself known as an original thinker by his Divine Legation of Moses a work which as it met with great opposition gave him occasion to display a singular talent in controversy As there was nothing congenial in the minds of him and Pope they neither of them sought the acquaintance of the other but mere chance brought them together a chance so propitious to Warburton's fortunes that it became an epoch in his life and was the leading circumstance to his becoming the owner of a fair estate and his promotion to a bishopric  The friendship of these two persons had its commencement in that bookseller's shop which is situate on the West side of the gateway leading down the Inner Templelane Warburton had some dealings with Jacob Robinson the publisher to whom the shop belonged and may be supposed to have been drawn there on business Pope might have a call of the like kind however that be there they met and entering into a conversation which was not soon ended conceived a mutual liking and as we may suppose plighted their faith to each other The fruit of this interview and the subsequent communications of the parties was the publication in November of a pamphlet with this title  'A Vindication of Mr Pope's Essay on Man By the author of the Divine Legation of Moses Printed for J Robinson'  Whether or not Crousaz ever replied to this vindication I am not at leisure to enquire I incline to  think he did not and that the controversy rested on the foot of the Examen and the Commentary on the one part and the Vindication on the other In the year Johnson took it into his head to review the argument and became a moderator in a dispute which on the side of Warburton had been conducted with a great degree of that indignation and contempt of his adversary which is visible in most of his writings This he did in two letters severally published in the Gentleman's Magazine for the months of March and November in the above year with a promise of more but proceeded no farther than to state the sentiments of Mr Crousaz respecting the poem from a seeming conviction that he was discussing an uninteresting question  Johnson had already tried his hand at political satire and had succeeded in it and though no new occasion offered he was either urged by distress or prompted by that clamour against the minister which in the year was become very loud to join in the popular cry and as it were to carry war into his own quarters This he did in a pamphlet intitled  'Marmor Norfolciense or an essay on an ancient prophetical inscription in Monkish rhyme lately discovered near Lynn in Norfolk by Probus Britannicus'  This mode of satire the publication of prophecies adapted to the incidents of the time when written and not so genuine as that of Nixon the Cheshire seer which some thought was fulfilled in is not an invention so new as many may think In some instances it has been a mere exercise of wit in others it has been used as a means to excite a people to  sedition Under the first class is noted that mentioned by Lord Bacon  When Hempe is spun  England's done  whereby as his lordship says it was generally conceived that after the princes had reigned which had the principal letters of that word Hempe which were Henry Edward Mary Philip and Elizabeth England should come to utter confusion which adds he thanks be to God is verified only in the change of name for the king's stile is now no more of England but of Britain Of the latter class of feigned prophecies many have within these few years been published by authors who had not wit enough to put them into verse  The inscription mentioned in the titlepage of the Marmor Norfolciense as also the relation of the manner of finding it are as will be readily supposed equally fictitious as the sole end of writing and publishing it was to give occasion for a comment which should concentrate all the topics of popular discontent accordingly it is insinuated because an act of parliament had then lately passed by which it was enacted that all law proceedings should be in English that therefore few lawyers understood Latin and the people are taught to look on the descendants of the Princess Sophia as intruders of yesterday receiving an estate by voluntary grant and erecting thereon a claim of hereditary right The explanation of the prophecy which is all ironical resolves itself into an invective against a standing army a ridicule of the balance of power complaints of the inactivity of the British lion and that the Hanover horse was suffered to suck his blood  A publication so inflammatory as this could hardly escape the notice of any government under which the legal idea of a libel might be supposed to exist The principles it contained were such as the Jacobites of the time openly avowed and warrants were issued and messengers employed to apprehend the author who though he had forborne to subscribe his name to the pamphlet the vigilance of those in pursuit of him had discovered To elude the search after him he together with his wife took an obscure lodging in a house in Lambeth marsh and lay there concealed till the scent after him was grown cold  In the same year an event arose that gave occasion to Johnson again to exercise his talent of satire viz the refusal of a licence for acting a tragedy intitled  'Gustavus Vasa or the deliverer of his country'  written by Henry Brooke to account for which seeming injury some previous information such as I am now about to give appears necessary  The places for theatrical representations in this country were anciently the king's palace and the mansions of the nobility but as the love of them increased taverns and other public houses in different parts of the city and suburbs were fitted up for the purpose and called playhouses The usurpation and the principles of the times put a stop to stage entertainments at the restoration they were revived and the places for representation constructed in the form of theatres their number at no time after that period exceeded four and in the year and long before it was reduced to three namely Drury lane Lincoln'sinn fields and the French playhouse in the Haymarket In that  year a man of the name of Odell took a throwster's shop in Ayliffe street Goodman's fields and collecting together a number of strolling players of both sexes opened it as a theatre Its contiguity to the city soon made it a place of great resort and what was apprehended from the advertisement of plays to be exhibited in that quarter of the town soon followed the adjacent houses became taverns in name but in truth they were houses of lewd resort  I once while I was chairman of the Middlesex sessions tried an indictment for a riot committed in one of these coffeehouses and in the course of the evidence discovered that it was kept by a woman a stiff quaker and was strangely puzzled to reconcile in my mind such a solecism in manners as the profession of purity with the practice of lewdness She appeared in court in the plain and neat garb of the people of that persuasion and was the wife of a seafaring man who being abroad had left her to pursue this lawless occupation I reproved her for her course of life but could not make her sensible that it was scandalons  and the former occupiers of them useful manufacturers and industrious artificers were driven to seek elsewhere for a residence In the course of the entertainments of this place the manager ventured to exhibit some few new plays among the rest a tragedy intitled  'King Charles the First'  containing sentiments suited to the characters of republicans sectaries and enthusiasts and a scenical representation of the events of that prince's disastrous reign better forgotten than remembered Sober persons thought that the revival of the memory of past transactions of such a kind as these were would serve no good purpose but on the contrary perpetuate that enmity between the friends to and opponents of our ecclesiastical and civil establishment which they  had heretofore excited and for suffering such representations as these they execrated not so much the author as the manager In this instance the indignation of the public was illdirected the arguments arising from this supposed abuse of histrionical liberty were not local they proved too much and rather applied to stage entertainments in general than to the conduct of a particular manager  But others looked on this newerected theatre with an eye more penetrating the merchants of London then a grave sagacious body of men found that it was a temptation to idleness and to pleasure that their clerks could not resist they regretted to see the corruptions of Coventgarden extended and the seats of industry hold forth allurements to vice and debauchery The principal of these was Sir John Barnard a wise and venerable man and a good citizen he as a magistrate had for some time been watching for such information as would bring the actors at Goodman'sfields playhouse within the reach of the vagrant laws but none was laid before him that he could with prudence act upon At length however an opportunity offered which he not only embraced but made an admirable use of Mr Henry Fielding then a young barrister without practice a dramatic poet and a patriot under the extreme pressure of necessity had in the year written a comedy or a farce we may call it either or both intitled  'Pasquin'  a dramatic satire on the times and brought it on the stage of the little playhouse in the Haymarket which being calculated to encourage popular clamour and containing in it many reflections on the public councils furnished reasons for bringing a bill into the house of commons for prohibiting  the acting of any interlude tragedy comedy opera play farce c without the authority of his Majesty's letterspatent or a licence from the lordchamberlain In this bill a clause was inserted on the motion of Sir John Barnard and a very judicious one it was by which it was made penal even with any such patent or licence to act or represent any such interlude c in any part of Great Britain except in the city of Westminster and such other places as his Majesty in person should reside in  Before the year in which this bill was brought in the property of Goodman'sfields playhouse had passed into the hands of Mr Henry Giffard who encouraged by a subscription pulled it down and under the direction of Shephard the architect the same that afterwards built Coventgarden theatre had erected a new one This man while the bill was depending petitioned against it and in his printed case represented the injury he was likely to sustain all the specious arguments of the great sums he had expended on the purchase of the house and rebuilding it in scenes cloaths c were urged with their utmost force and his right to an equivalent stated but all to no effect the bill passed and the statute is now part of the law of the land It is true an evasion of it was afterwards contrived by an advertisement of a concert with a play given gratis but that subterfuge was soon abandoned  The operation of this statute was twofold it subjected theatrical representations to a licence and suppressed a nuisance And here let me observe that although of plays it is said that they teach morality and  of the stage that it is the mirror of human life these assertions are mere declamation and have no foundation in truth or experience on the contrary a playhouse and the regions about it are the very hotbeds of vice how else comes it to pass that no sooner is a playhouse opened in any part of the kingdom than it becomes surrounded by an halo of brothels Of this truth the neighbourhood of the place I am now speaking of has had experience one parish alone adjacent thereto having to my knowledge expended the sum of l in prosecutions for the purpose of removing those inhabitants whom for instruction in the science of human life the playhouse had drawn thither  Mr Brooke the author abovementioned having with his eyes open and the statute of the tenth of George the second staring him in the face written a tragedy in which as will be presently shewn under pretence of a laudable zeal for the cause of liberty he inculcates principles not only antimonarchical but scarcely consistent with any system of civil subordination what wonder is it that under a monarchical government a licence for such a theatrical representation should be refused or that such a refusal should be followed by a prohibition of the acting it  This interposition of legal authority was looked upon by the author's friends in which number were included all the Jacobites in the kingdom as an infraction of a natural right and as affecting the cause of liberty To express their resentment of this injury they advised him to send it to the press and by a subscription to the publication of near a thousand persons encouraged others to the like attempts By means of the printed copy any one is enabled to judge of its  general tendency and by reflecting on the sentiments inculcated in the following speeches therein to be found to measure the injustice done him  Is it of fate that he who assumes a crown  Throws off humanity  Beyond the sweeping of the proudest train  That shades a monarch's heel I prize these weeds  our Dalecarlians  Have oft been known to give a law to kings  Divide and conquer is the sum of politics  if thou think'st  That empire is of titled birth or blood  That nature in the proud behalf of one  Shall disenfranchise all her lordly race  And bow her general issue to the yoke  Of private domination c  thou art the minister  The reverend monitor of vice  The fence of virtue is a chief's best caution  And the firm surety of my people's hearts  Is all the guard that e'er shall wait Gustavus  The dedication to the play addressed to the subscribers gives the reader to understand that the author had  'studied the ancient laws of his country though not conversant with her present political state' that he is 'a friend to national liberty and personal freedom' meaning by the first 'a state resulting from virtue or reason ruling in a breast superior to appetite and passion' and by the last 'a security arising from the nature of a wellordered constitution for those advantages  and privileges that each man has a right to by contributing as a member to the weal of that community'  these declarations are interspersed with reflections on the lordchamberlain and a complaint that his treatment of the author  'was singular and unprecedented'  after which follows an effusion of patriotic sentiments serving to shew that a monarch or head of such a constitution as he above has described is  'sceptered in the hearts of his people'  Upon occasion of this publication Johnson was employed by one Corbet a bookseller of small note to take up the cause of this injured author and he did it in a pamphlet intitled  'A Compleat Vindication of the Licensers of the Stage from the malicious and scandalous aspersions of Mr Brooke author of Gustavus Vasa'  to  Criticism would be ill employed in a minute examination of the Marmor Norfolciense and the Vindication of the Licensers in general it may suffice to say that they are both ironical that they display neither learning nor wit and that in neither of them is there to be discovered a single ray of that brightness which beams so strongly in the author's moral and political essays Did it become a man of his discernment endowed with such powers of reasoning and eloquence as he possessed to adopt vulgar prejudices or in the cant of the opposition to clamor against placemen and pensioners and standing armies to ridicule the apprehension of that invasion in favour of the pretender which himself but a few years after became a witness to or to compare the improbability of such an event with that of a general insurrection of all who were prohibited the use of gin  Of all the modes of satire I know none so feeble as that of uninterrupted irony The reason of this seems to be that in that kind of writing the author is compelled to advance positions which no reader can think he believes and to put questions that can be answered in but one way and that such an one as thwarts the sense of the propounder Of this kind of interrogatories the pamphlet I am speaking of seems to be an example  'Is the man without pension or place to suspect the impartiality or the judgment of those who are entrusted with the administration of public affairs Is he when the law is not strictly observed in regard to him to think himself aggrieved to tell his sentiments in print to assert his claim to better usage and fly for redress to another tribunal'  Who does not see that to these several queries the answer must be in the affirmative and if so the point of the writer's wit is in this instance blunted and his argument baffled  In the course of this mock vindication of power Johnson has taken a wide scope and adopted all the vulgar topics of complaint as they were vented weekly in the public papers and in the writings of Bolingbroke flimsy and malignant as they are And here let me note a curious sophism of that superficial thinker which I remember to have seen in his celebrated Dissertation on Parties but which not having the book by me I cite by memory it is to this purpose  'The advocates of the minister' says his Lordship 'defy us to shew that under his administration any infraction had been made of the original contract'  To this we answer that between such an infraction and the loss of  our liberties there can no point of time intervene such a cause and such an effect being so closely connected that we cannot see the one till we feel the other  Such was the conduct of opposition at this time and by such futile arguments as the above were the silly people of three kingdoms deluded into a belief that their liberties were in danger and that nothing could save this country from impending ruin and that the most formidable of all the evils they had to dread was the continuance of the then administration of which they had nothing worse to say than that they hated it  The truth is that Johnson's political prejudices were a mist that the eye of his judgment could not penetrate in all the measures of government he could see nothing right nor could he be convinced in his invectives against a standing army as the Jacobites affected to call it that the peasantry of a country was not an adequate defence against an invasion of it by an armed force He almost asserted in terms that the succession to the crown had been illegally interrupted and that from whigpolitics none of the benefits of government could be expected He could but just endure the opposition to the minister because conducted on whig principles and I have heard him say that during the whole course of it the two parties were bidding for the people At other times and in the heat of his resentment I have heard him assert that since the death of Queen Anne it had been the policy of the administration to promote to ecclesiastical dignities none but the most worthless and undeserving men nor would he then exclude from this bigotted censure those illustrious divines Wake Gibson Sherlock Butler Herring Pearce and least of all Hoadly  in competition with whom he would set Hickes Brett Leslie and others of the nonjurors whose names are scarcely now remembered From hence it appears and to his honour be it said that his principles cooperated with his necessities and that the prostitution of his talents taking the term in one and that its worst sense could not in justice be imputed to him  But there is another and a less criminal sense of the word prostitution in which in common with all who are called authors by profession he may be said to stand in need of an excuse When Milton wrote the Paradise Lost the sum he received for the copy was not his motive but was an adventitious benefit that resulted from the exercise of his poetical faculty In Johnson's case as well in the instances above given as almost all the others that occurred during the course of his life the impulse of genius was wanting had that alone operated in his choice of subjects to write on mankind would have been indebted to him for a variety of original interesting and useful compositions and translations of some and new editions of others of the ancient authors The truth of which assertion I think I may safely ground on a catalogue of publications projected by him

allow on the contrary to the astonishment of myself who have heard him and many others he has frequently declared that the  only true and genuine motive to the writing of books was the assurance of pecuniary profit Notwithstanding the boldness of this assertion there are but few that can be persuaded to yield to it and after all the best apology for Johnson will be found to consist in his want of a profession the pressure of his necessities and the example of such men as Castalio Gesner and Salmasius among foreigners and Fuller Howel L'Estrange Dryden Chambers and Hume not to mention others now living among ourselves  The principle here noted was not only in the above instance avowed by Johnson but seems to have been wrought by him into a habit He was never greedy of money but without money could not be stimulated to write I have been told by a clergyman of some eminence with whom he had been long acquainted that being to preach on a particular occasion he applied as others under a like necessity had frequently done to Johnson for help  'I will write a  sermon for thee' said Johnson 'but thou must pay me for it'  Yet was he not so indifferent to the subjects that he was requested to write on as at any time to abandon either his religious or political principles He would no more have put his name to an Arian or Socinian tract than to a defence of Atheism At the time when  'Faction Detected'  came out a pamphlet of which the late lord Egmont is now generally understood to have been the author Osborne the bookseller held out to him a strong temptation to answer it which he refused being convinced as he assured me that the charge contained in it was made good and that the argument grounded thereon was unanswerable  Indeed whoever peruses that masterly performance must be convinced that a spirit similar to that which induced the Israelites when under the conduct of their wise legislator to cry out  'Ye take too much upon ye'  is the most frequent motive to opposition and that whoever hopes to govern a free people by reason is mistaken in his judgment of human nature  'He' says Hooker 'that goeth about to persuade a people that they are not well governed shall never want attentive and favourable hearers'  and the same author speaking of legislation in general delivers this as his sentiment  'Laws politic ordained for external order and regimen amongst men are never framed as they should be unless presuming the will of man to be obstinate rebellious and averse from all obedience unto the sacred laws of his nature In a word unless presuming man in regard of his depraved mind little better than a wild beast they do accordingly provide notwithstanding so to frame his outward actions as that they be no hindrance unto the common good for which societies  were instituted Unless they do this they are not perfect'  Eccles Pol Lib I Sect Ibid Sect  That these were the sentiments of Johnson also I am warranted to say by frequent declarations to the same purpose which I have heard him make and to these I attribute it that he ever after acquiesced in the measures of government through the succession of administrations  It has already been mentioned in the account above given of Savage that the friends of that illstarred man had set on foot a subscription for his support and that Swansea was the place they had fixed on for his residence the same was completed at the end of the year Johnson at that time lodged at Greenwich and there parted with that friend and companion of his midnight rambles whom it was never his fortune again to see The event is antedated in the poem of  'London'  but in every particular except the difference of a year what is there said of the departure of Thales must be understood of Savage and looked upon as true history In his life of Savage Johnson has mentioned the circumstances that attended it and deplored this separation as he would have done a greater misfortune than it proved that it was in reality none may be inferred from Savage's inability arising from his circumstances his course of life and the laxity of his mind to do good to any one it is rather to be suspected that his example was contagious and tended to confirm Johnson in his indolence and those other evil habits which it was the labour of his life to conquer They who were witnesses of Johnson's persevering temperance in the article of drinking for at least the latter half of his life will scarcely believe that during part of the former he was a lover of wine that he not  only indulged himself in the use of it when he could procure it but with a reflex delight contemplated the act of drinking it with all the circumstances that render it grateful to the palate or pleasing to the eye in the language of Solomon  'he looked upon the wine when it was red when it gave his colour in the cup and when it moved itself aright  Proverbs chap xxiii v  '  In contradiction to those who having a wife and children prefer domestic enjoyments to those which a tavern affords I have heard him assert that a tavernchair was the throne of human felicity  'As soon' said he 'as I enter the door of a tavern I experience an oblivion of care and a freedom from solicitude  It is worthy of remark by those who are curious in observing customs and modes of living how little these houses of entertainment are now frequented and what a diminution in their number has been experienced in London and Westminster in a period of about forty years backward The history of taverns in this country may be traced back to the time of Hen IV for so ancient is that of the Boar's Head in Eastcheap the rendezvous of Prince Henry and his lewd companions as we learn from Shakespeare Of little less antiquity is the White Hart without Bishop'sgate which now bears in the front of it the date of its erection  Anciently there stood in Old Palaceyard Westminster a tavern known by the sign of the White Rose the symbol of the York faction It was near the chapel of our Lady behind the high altar of the abbeychurch Together with that chapel it was in pulled down and on the scite of both was erected the chapel of Henry the Seventh At the restoration the Cavaliers and other adherents to the royal party for joy of that event were for a time incessantly drunk and from a picture of their manners in Cowley's comedy Cutter of Colemanstreet must be supposed to have greatly contributed to the increase of taverns When the frenzy of the times was abated taverns especially those about the Exchange became places for the transaction of almost all manner of business there accounts were settled conveyances executed and there attornies sat as at inns in the country on market days to receive their clients In that space near the Royal Exchange which is encompassed by Lombard Gracechurch part of Bishop'sgate and Threadneedle streets the number of taverns was not so few as twenty and on the scite of the Bank there stood four At the Crown which was one of them it was not unusual in a morning to draw a butt of mountain a hundred and twenty gallons in gills  when I am seated I find the master courteous and the servants obsequious to my call anxious to know and ready to supply my wants wine there exhilarates my spirits and prompts me to free conversation and an interchange of discourse with those whom I most love I dogmatise and am contradicted and in this conflict of opinions and sentiments I find delight'  How far his conversations with Savage might induce him thus to delight in tavernsociety which is often a temptation to greater enormities than excessive drinking cannot now be known nor would it answer any good purpose to enquire It may nevertheless be conjectured that whatever habits he had contracted of idleness neglect of his person or indifference in the choice of his company received no correction or check from such an example as Savage's conduct held forth and farther it is conjectured that he would have been less troubled with those reflections which in his latest hours are known to have given him uneasiness had he never become acquainted with one so loose in his morals and so well acquainted with the vices of the town as this man appears to have been We are to remember that Johnson was at this time a husband can it therefore be supposed that the society of such a man as Savage had any tendency to improve him in the exercise of the domestic virtues nay rather we must doubt it and  ascribe to an indifference in the discharge of them arising from their nocturnal excursions the incident of a temporary separation of Johnson from his wife which soon took place and that while he was in a lodging in Fleet street she was harboured by a friend near the Tower It is true that this separation continued but a short time and that if indeed his affection at that instant was alienated from her it soon returned for his attachment to her appears by a variety of notes and memorandums concerning her in books that she was accustomed to read in now in my custody to have been equal to what it ought to be nay Garrick would often risque offending them both by mimicking his mode of gallantry and his uxorious behaviour towards her  The little profit or indeed reputation that accrued to Johnson by the writing of political pamphlets led him to think of other exercises for his pen He had so early as solicited employment of Cave but Cave's correspondents were so numerous that he had little for him till the beginning of the year when Johnson conceived a thought of enriching the Magazine with a biographical article and wrote for it the Life of Father Paul an abridgement as it seems to be of that life of him which Johnson intended to have prefixed to his translation of the History of the Council of Trent The motive to this and other exertions of the same talent in the lives of Boerhaave Blake Barretier and other eminent persons was his wants which at one time were so pressing as to induce him in a letter to Cave hereinbefore inserted to intimate to him that he wanted a dinner  Johnson who was never deficient in gratitude for the assistance which he received from Cave became his friend and what was more in Cave's estimation than any personal attachment whatever a friend to his Magazine for he being at this time engaged in a controversy with a knot of booksellers the proprietors of a rival publication the London Magazine Johnson wrote and addressed to him the following Ode  AD URBANUM  Urbane nullis fesse laboribus  Urbane nullis victe calumniis  Cui fronte sertum in erudita  Perpetuo viret et virebit  Quid moliatur gens imitantium  Quid et minetur sollicitus parum  Vacare solis perge musis  Juxta animo studiisque felix  Linguae

sic viola adjuvat  Immista sic Iris refulget  Aethereis variata fucis  It was published in the Magazine for March and imitated in the following stanzas in that for the month of May following  Hail Urban indefatigable man  Unwearied yet by all thy useful toil  Whom num'rous slanderers assault in vain  Whom no base calumny can put to foil  But still the laurel on thy learned brow  Flourishes fair and shall for ever grow  What mean the servile imitating crew  What their vain blust'ring and their empty noise  Ne'er seek but still thy noble ends pursue  Unconquer'd by the rabble's venal voice  Still to the muse thy studious mind apply  Happy in temper as in industry  The senseless sneerings of an haughty tongue  Unworthy thy attention to engage  Unheeded pass and tho' they mean thee wrong  By manly silence disappoint their rage  Assiduous diligence confounds its foes  Resistless tho' malicious crouds oppose  Exert thy powers nor slacken in the course  Thy spotless fame shall quash all false reports  Exert thy powers nor fear a rival's force  But thou shalt smile at all his vain efforts  Thy labours shall be crown'd with large success  The muse's aid thy magazine shall bless  No page more grateful to th' harmonious nine  Than that wherein thy labours we survey  Where solemn themes in fuller splendor shine  Delightful mixture blended with the gay  Where in improving various joys we find  A welcome respite to the wearied mind  Thus when the nymphs in some fair verdant mead  Of various flow'rs a beauteous wreath compose  The lovely violet's azurepainted head  Adds lustre to the crimsonblushing rose  Thus splendid Iris with her varied dye  Shines in the aether and adorns the sky  May  BRITON  The provocation that gave rise to this furious contest as it will presently appear to have been was the increasing demand for Cave's publication and the check it gave to the sale of its rival which at one time was so great as to throw back no fewer than seventy thousand copies on the hands of the proprietors To revenge this injury the confederate booksellers gave out that Sylvanus Urban whom for no conceivable reason they dignified with the appellation of Doctor was become mad assigning as the cause of his insanity his publication in the Magazine of sundry mathematical problems essays and questions on abstruse subjects sent him by many of his learned correspondents Cave who for some months had been rebutting the calumnies of his adversaries and that with such success as provoked them to the outrage abovementioned now felt that he had them at mercy With that sagacity which we frequently observe but wonder at in men of slow parts he seemed to anticipate  the advice contained in the second and third stanzas of Johnson's ode and forbore a reply though not his revenge which he gratified in such a manner as seems to absolve him from the guilt imputable in most cases to that passion this he did by inserting as an article of public intelligence in his Historical Chronicle for the month of February the following paragraph  "Monday About o'clock the famous Dr Urban having some time past been possessed with a violent frenzy broke loose from his nurse and run all through the streets of London and Westminster distributing quack bills swearing he would go visit his beautiful  Garden of Eden  raving against  Common Sense  A party paper so intitled  and the London Magazine and singing a mad song set to music by Peter the Wild Youth but being at last secured was conveyed to his lodgings in Moorfields where he continues uttering horrid imprecations against several booksellers and printers 'Tis thought this  poor  man's misfortune is owing to his having lately perplexed himself with  biblical questions mathematical problems astronomical equations and  methods to find the longitude"  '  This silly paragraph and such like buffoonery inserted in the newspapers at the charge of the proprietors of the  London Magazine  is all the answer given to the remarks on their inimitable preface some passages of which are quoted in the beginning of this magazine  In the course of many years observation I am able to recollect one and only one instance of this method of treating a scurrilous adversary An ingenious mechanic of the name of Newsham who with the assistance of the late Dr Defaguliers had made many considerable improvements in the construction of engines for extinguishing fires had obtained a patent for one in particular which conjoined in one and the same machine the active powers of both the hands and feet an ignorant and impudent pretender invaded his right and the more to exasperate him wrote with his own hand and subscribed a letter to Mr Newsham made up of the foulest abuse and a discussion of the principles of mechanics in language which for its nonsense and bad spelling conveyed no ideas Mr Newsham printed and dispersed some thousand copies verbatim et literatim of this letter and without a single remark thereon sunk the reputation of his adversary so low as ever after to be irretrieyable  '  The publication in the manner abovementioned of this senseless and malignant fiction and the care and attention of Cave in the compilation of his magazine together with the assistance he received from a variety of ingenious and learned correspondents enabled him in a short time to triumph over his rivals and increased the sale thereof to a number that no other could ever equal  It was no part of Cave's original design to give the debates in either house of parliament but the opposition to the minister and the spirit that conducted it had excited in the people a great eagerness to know what was going forward in both and he knew that to gratify that desire was to encrease the demand for his pamphlet Indeed the experiment had already been made for the speeches in parliament had for some time been given in the Political State of Great Britain a publication above spoken of and though drawn up by persons no way equal to such an undertaking were well received These for the most part were taken by stealth and were compiled from the information of listeners and the underofficers and doorkeepers of either house but Cave had an interest  with some of the members of both arising from an employment he held in the postoffice that of inspector of the franks which not only gave him the privilege of sending his letters free of postage but an acquaintance with and occasions of access to many of them  Of this advantage he was too good a judge of his own interest not to avail himself He therefore determined to gratify his readers with as much of this kind of intelligence as he could procure and it was safe to communicate his resolution was to frequent the two houses whenever an important debate was likely to come on and from such expressions and particulars in the course thereof as could be collected and retained in memory to give the arguments on either side This resolution he put into practice in July His method of proceeding is variously reported but I have been informed by some who were much about him that taking with him a friend or two he found means to procure for them and himself admission into the gallery of the house of commons or to some concealed station in the other and that then they privately took down notes of the several speeches and the general tendency and substance of the arguments Thus furnished Cave and his associates would adjourn to a neighbouring tavern and compare and adjust their notes by means whereof and the help of their memories they became enabled to fix at least the substance of what they had so lately heard and remarked  The reducing this crude matter into form was the work of a future day and of an abler hand viz Guthrie the historian a writer for the booksellers whom Cave retained for the purpose the speeches thus composed were given monthly to the public  and perused and red with great eagerness those who contemplated them thought they discovered in them not merely the political principles but the stile and manner of the speaker the fact is that there was little discrimination of the latter between the speeches of the best and the worst orators in either assembly and in most instances the persons to whom they were ascribed were here made to speak with more eloquence and even propriety of diction than in the place of debate they were able to do Sir John Barnard for instance a man of no learning or reading and who by the way had been bred a quaker had a stile little better than an ordinary mechanic and which abounded with such phrases as if so beset caseandnobody more soand other such vulgarisms yet was he made in the magazine to debate in language as correct and polished as that of Sir William Wyndham or Mr Pulteney though it must be confessed that so weighty was his matter on subjects of commerce that Sir Robert Walpole as I have been credibly informed was used to say that when he had answered Sir John Barnard he looked upon that day's business in the house of commons to be as good as over  The vigorous opposition to the minister and the motion in both houses of the thirteenth of February to remove him were a new aera in politics and as the debates on that occasion were warmer than had ever then been known the drawing them up required in Cave's opinion the pen of a more nervous writer than he who had hitherto conducted them Johnson who in his former publications in prose had given no very favorable specimens of stile had by this time by the study of the best of our old English  writers such as Sir Thomas More Ascham Hooker Spenser archbishop Sandys Jewel Chillingworth Hales of Eton and others formed a new one consisting in original phrases and new combinations of the integral parts of sentences which with the infusion of words derived from the Latin and accommodated to our idiom were such an improvement of the language as greatly tended to enrich it Cave therefore thought him a fit person to conduct this part of his monthly publication and dismissing Guthrie committed the care of it to Johnson  Before this change of hands Cave had been checked by some intimations from the clerks of the house of commons that his printing the debates had given offence to the speaker and might subject him to censure this he for some time regarded but little relying possibly upon the indulgence that had been shewn as well to the publishers of the Political State of Great Britain who were the first that ventured on this practice as to himself but a resolution of the house at length gave him to understand that it would be prudence in him to desist from it The thought of putting his readers on short allowance was very unpleasing to him and this with the apprehension that the sale of his Magazine might be affected by the omission of a kind of intelligence which they had been accustomed to drove him to many contrivances to evade the prohibition out of which he chose one that scarce any man but himself would have thought of it was the giving to the public the debates in the British senate under a fictitious designation Every one he knew was acquainted with Gulliver's Travels he therefore in his magazine  for June begins the month by feigning that the debates in the senate of Magna Lilliputia were then extant and referring to the resolution of the house of commons abovementioned whereby he was forbidden to insert any account of the proceedings of the British parliament he pretends to doubt not but his readers will be pleased with the insertion of what he calls the appendix to captain Gulliver's account of Lilliput in their room A change of fictitious for real names of persons countries and provinces was absolutely necessary for the carrying on this design and accordingly by transposing the letters and otherwise anagrammatizing proper names he has through the medium of nonsense given light to that which he would be thought to conceal  Farther to aid his reader as to the names of countries c he published at the end of his magazine for a fictitious proposal for printing by subscription a work intitled Anagrammata Rediviva or the art of composing and resolving anagrams with a reference to the booksellers agents and masters of ships in the cities countries and provinces therein described by barbarous names opposed to those which they are meant to signify he also at the end of the magazines for and gave a list of christian and surnames pretendedly synonimous forming thereby a key to that otherwise unintelligible jargon which Cave by this subterfuge had introduced into the debates  The proprietors of the London Magazine who also gave the debates but from documents less authentic than those of C  ve compelled by the same necessity  that forced him to this artifice took another course they feigned to give the debates in the Roman senate and by adapting Roman names to the several speeches rendered them more plausible than they appear under Cave's management  The artifice however succeeded in both instances the resolution of the commons was never enforced and the debates were published with impunity I will not disgrace my page by the insertion of any of those barbarous appellations which Cave had invented and which I dare say were music to his ear but content myself with saying that Guthrie acquiesced in Cave's fiction and the nonsense which it involved and as it was found to answer its end Johnson scrupled not to adopt it  The debates penned by Johnson were not only more methodical and better connected than those of Guthrie but in all the ornaments of stile superior they were written at those seasons when he was able to raise his imagination to such a pitch of servour as bordered upon enthusiasm which that he might the better do his practice was to shut himself up in a room assigned him at St John's gate to which he would not suffer any one to approach except the compositor or Cave's boy for matter which as fast as he composed it he tumbled out at the door  Never were the force of reasoning or the powers of popular eloquence more evidently displayed or the arts of sophistry more clearly detected than in these animated compositions Nor are they more worthy of admiration for these their excellencies than for that peculiarity of language which discriminates  the debates of each assembly from the other and the various colouring which he has found the art of giving to particular speeches The characteristic of the one assembly we know is Dignity the privilege of the other Freedom of Expression To speak of the first when a member thereof endowed with wisdom gravity and experience is made to rise the stile which Johnson gives him is nervous his matter weighty and his arguments convincing and when a mere popular orator takes up a debate his eloquence is by him represented in a glare of false rhetoric specious reasoning an affectation of wit and a disposition to trifle with subjects the most interesting With great judgment also does Johnson adopt the unrestrained oratory of the other house and with equal facility imitate the deepmouthed rancour of Pulteney and the yelping pertinacity of Pitt  As an illustration of the former part of this position I shall here give two speeches the one of the lordchancellor Hardwicke on the motion of lord Carteret for an address to his Majesty beseeching him to remove Sir Robert Walpole from his presence and councils for ever and the other of lord Chesterfield on a bill intitled  'An act for repealing certain duties on spirituous liquors and on licences for retailing the same and for laying other duties on spirituous liquors and on licenses for retailing the said liquors'  That of lord Hardwicke is as follows  'My Lords  'Though I very readily admit that crimes ought to be punished that a treacherous administration of public affairs is in a very high degree criminal that even ignorance where it is the consequence of neglect deserves the severest animadversion and that it is the privilege and duty of this house to watch over the state of the nation and inform his Majesty of any errors committed by his ministers yet I am far from being convinced either of the justice or necessity of the motion now under consideration  'The most flagrant and invidious part of the charge against the right honourable gentleman appears to consist in this that he has engrossed an exorbitant degree of power and usurped an unlimited influence over the whole system of government that he disposes of all honours and preferments and that he is not only first but sole minister  'But of this boundless usurpation my lords what proof has been laid before you what beyond loud exaggerations pompous rhetoric and specious appeals to common fame common fame which at least may sometimes err and which though it may afford sufficient ground for suspicion and enquiry was never yet admitted as conclusive evidence where the immediate necessities of the public did not preclude the common forms of examination where the power of the offender did not make it dangerous to attack him by a legal prosecution or where the conduct of the accuser did not plainly  discover that they were more eager of blood than of justice and more solicitous to destroy than to convict  'I hope none of these circumstances my lords can at present obstruct a candid and deliberate enquiry with regard to the public I am not able to discover any pressing exigences that demand a more compendious method of proceeding than the established laws of the land and the wisdom of our ancestors have prescribed I know not any calamity that will be aggravated nor any danger that will become more formidable by suffering this question to be legally tried  'Nor is there my lords in the circumstances of the person accused any thing that can incite us to a hasty process for if what is alledged by the noble lords is not exaggerated beyond the truth if he is universally detested by the whole nation and loaded with execrations by the public voice if he is considered as the author of all our miseries and the source of all our corruptions if he has ruined our trade and depressed our power impoverished the people and attempted to enslave them there is at least no danger of an insurrection in his favour or any probability that his party will grow stronger by delays For my lords to find friends in adversity and assertors in distress is only the prerogative of innocence and virtue  'The gentleman against whom this formidable charge is drawn up is I think not suspected of any intention to have recourse either to force or flight he has always appeared willing to be tried by the laws of his country and to stand an impartial examination  he neither opposes nor eludes enquiry neither flies from justice nor defies it  'And yet less my lords can I suspect that those by whom he is accused act from any motive that may influence them to desire a sentence not supported by evidence or conformable to truth or that they can wish the ruin of any man whose crimes are not notorious and flagrant that they persecute from private malice or endeavour to exalt themselves by the fall of another  'Let us therefore my lords enquire before we determine and suffer evidence to precede our sentence The charge if it is just must be by its own nature easily proved and that no proof is brought may perhaps be sufficient to make us suspect that it is not just  'For my lords what is the evidence of common fame which has been so much exalted and so confidently produced Does not every man see that on such occasions two questions may be asked of which perhaps neither can easily be answered and which yet must both be resolved before common fame can be admitted as a proof of facts  'It is first to be enquired my lords whether the reports of fame are necessarily or even probably true A question very intricate and diffusive entangled with a thousand and involving a thousand distinctionsa question of which it may be said that a man may very plausibly maintain either side and of which perhaps after months or years wasted in disputation no other decision can be obtained than what is obvious at the first view that they are often true and often false and therefore can only  be grounds of enquiry not reasons of determination  'But if it appear my lords that this oracle cannot be deceived we are then to enquire after another difficulty we are to enquire What is fame  'Is fame my lords that fame which cannot err a report that flies on a sudden through a nation of which no man can discover the original a sudden blast of rumour that inflames or intimidates a people and obtains without authority a general credit No man versed in history can enquire whether such reports may not deceive Is fame rather a settled opinion prevailing by degrees and for some time established How long then my lords and in what degree must it have been established to obtain undoubted credit and when does it commence infallible If the people are divided in their opinions as in all public questions it has hitherto happened fame is I suppose the voice of the majority For if the two parties are equal in their numbers fame will be equal then how great must be the majority before it can lay claim to this powerful auxiliary and how shall that majority be numbered  'These questions my lords may be thought perhaps with justice too ludicrous in this place but in my opinion they contribute to shew the precarious and uncertain nature of the evidence so much confided in  'Common fame my lords is to every man only what he himself commonly hears and it is in the power of any man's acquaintance to vitiate the evidence which they report and to stun him with clamours and terrify him with apprehensions of miseries never felt and dangers invisible  'But without such a combination we are to remember that most men associate with those of their own opinions and that the rank of those that compose this assembly naturally disposes such as are admitted to their company to relate or to invent such reports as may be favourably received so that what appears to one lord the general voice of common fame may by another be thought only the murmur of a petty faction despicable with regard to their numbers and detestable if we consider their principles  'So difficult is it my lords to form any solid judgment concerning the extent and prevalence of any particular report and the degree of credit to be given to it The industry of a party may supply the defect of numbers and some concurrent circumstances may contribute to give credit to a false report  'But my lords we are ourselves appealed to as witnesses of the truth of facts which prove him to be sole minister of the number of his dependants the advancement of his friends the disappointments of his opponents and the declarations made by his followers of adherence and fidelity  'If it should be granted my lords that there is nothing in these representations exaggerated beyond the truth and that nothing is represented in an improper light what consequence can we draw but that the followers of this gentleman make use of those arts which have always been practised by the candidates of preferment that they endeavour to gain their patron's smile by flattery and panegyric and to keep it by assiduity and an appearance of gratitude And if such applications exalted any man to the authority and title of first minister the nation has never in my  memory been without some man in that station for there is always some one to whom ambition and avarice have paid their court and whose regards have been purchased at the expence of truth  'Nor is it to be wondered at my lords that posts of honour and profit have been bestowed upon the friends of the administration for who enriches or exalts his enemies Who will encrease the influence that is to be exerted against him or add strength to the blow that is levelled at himself  'That the right honourable gentleman is the only disposer of honours has never yet appeared it is not pretended my lords that he distributes them without the consent of his Majesty nor even that his recommendation is absolutely necessary to the success of any man's applications If he has gained more of his Majesty's confidence and esteem than any other of his servants he has done only what every man endeavours and what therefore is not to be imputed to him as a crime  'It is impossible my lords that Kings like other men should not have particular motions of inclination or dislike it is possible that they may fix their affection upon objects not in the highest degree worthy of their regard and overlook others that may boast of greater excellencies and more shining merit but this is not to be supposed without proof and the regard of the King as of any other man is one argument of desert more than he can produce who has endeavoured after it without effect  'This imputed usurpation must be proved upon him either by his own confession or by the evidence of others and it has not yet been pretended that he  assumes the title of Prime Minister or indeed that it is applied to him by any but his enemies and it may easily be conceived how weakly the most uncorrupted innocence would be supported if all the aspersions of its enemies were to be received as proofs against it  'Nor does it appear my lords that any other evidence can be brought against him on this head or that any man will stand forth and affirm that either he has been injured himself by this gentleman or known any injury done by him to another by the exertion of authority with which he was not lawfully invested such evidence my lords the laws of our country require to be produced before any man can be punished censured or disgraced No man is obliged to prove his innocence but may call upon his prosecutors to support their accusation and why this honourable gentleman whatever may have been his conduct should be treated in a different manner than any other criminal I am by no means able to discover  'Though there has been no evidence offered of his guilt your lordships have heard an attestation of his innocence from the noble Nardac  Duke  who spoke first against the motion of whom it cannot be suspected that he would voluntarily engage to answer for measures which he pursued in blind compliance with the direction of another The same testimony my lords can I produce and affirm with equal truth that in the administration of my province I am independent and left entirely to the decisions of my own judgment  'In every government my lords as in every family some either by accident or a natural industry or a superior capacity or some other cause will be engaged in more business and treated with more confidence than others but if every man is willing to answer for the conduct of his own province there is all the security against corruption that can possibly be obtained for if every man's regard to his own safety and reputation will prevent him from betraying his trust or abusing his power much more will it incite him to prevent any misconduct in another for which he must himself be accountable Men are usually sufficiently tenacious of power and ready to vindicate their separate rights when nothing but their pride is affected by the usurpation but surely no man will patiently suffer his province to be invaded when he may himself be ruined by the conduct of the invader  'Thus my lords it appears to me to be not only without proof but without probability and the first minister can in my opinion be nothing more than a formidable illusion which when one man thinks he has seen it he shews to another as easily frighted as himself who joins with him in propagating the notion and in spreading terror and resentment over the nation till at last the panic becomes general and what was at first only whispered by malice or prejudice in the ears of ignorance or credulity is adopted by common fame and echoed back from the people to the senate  'I have hitherto my lords confined myself to the consideration of one single article of this complicated charge because it appears to me to be the only part  of it necessary to be examined for if once it be acknowledged that the affairs of the nation are transacted not by the minister but the administration by the council in which every man who sits there has an equal voice and equal authority the blame or praise of all the measures must be transferred from him to the council and every man that has advised or concurred in them will deserve the same censure or the same applause as it is unjust to punish one man for the crimes of another it is unjust to chuse one man out for punishment from among many others equally guilty  'But I doubt not my lords when all those measures are equitably considered there will be no punishnishment to be dreaded because neither negligence nor treachery will be discovered For my lords with regard to the treaty of Vinena  Vienna  let us suppose our ministers deceived by ignorant or corrupt intelligence let us admit that they were cautious where there was no danger and neglected some opportunities which if they had received better information they might have improved to the advantage and security of the nation what have they done even under all these disadvantageous suppositions but followed the lights which they judged most clear and by which they hoped to be conducted to honour and to safety  'Policy my lords is very different from prescience the utmost that can be attained is probability and that for the most part in a low degree It is observed that no man is wise but as you take into consideration the weakness of another a maxim more eminently true of political wisdom which  consists very often only in discovering designs which could never be known but by the folly or treachery of those to whom they are trusted If our enemies were wise enough to keep their own secrets neither our ministers nor our patriots would be able to know or prevent their designs nor would it be any reproach to their sagacity that they did not know what nobody would tell them  'If therefore my lords the princes whose interest is contrary to our own have been at any time served by honest and wise men there was a time when our ministers could act only by conjecture and might be mistaken without a crime  'If it was always in our power to penetrate into the intentions of our enemies they must necessarily have the same means of making themselves acquainted with our projects and yet when any of them are discovered we think it just to impute it to the negligence of the minister  'Thus my lords every man is inclined to judge with prejudice and partiality When we suffer by the prudence of our enemies we charge our ministers with want of vigilance without considering that very often nothing is necessary to clude the most penetrating sagacity but obstinate silence  'If we enquire into the transactions of past times shall we find any man however renowned for his abilities not sometimes imposed upon by falshoods and sometimes betrayed by his own reasonings into measures destructive of the purposes which he endeavoured to promore There is no man of whose penetration higher ideas have been justly formed or who gave more frequent proofs of an uncommon penetration into futurity  than Clewmro  Cromwell  and yet succeeding times have sufficiently discovered the weakness of aggrandizing Blefuscu  France  by depressing Iberia  Spain  and we wonder now how so much policy could fall into so gross an error as not rather to suffer power to remain in the distant enemy than transfer it to another equally divided from us by interest and sar more formidable by the situation of his dominions  'Clewmro my lords suffered himself to be hurried away by the near prospect of present advantages and the apprehension of present dangers and every other man has been in the same manner sometimes deluded into a preference of smaller present advantage to a greater which was more remote  'Let it not be urged my lords that politics are advanced since the time of Clewmro and that errors which might then be committed by the wisest administration are now gross and reproachful we are to remember that every part of policy has been equally improved and that if more methods of discovery have been struck out there have been likewise more arts invented of eluding it  'When therefore we enquire into the conduct or examine the abilities of a minister we are not to expect that he should appear never to have been deceived but that he should never be found to have neglected any proper means of information nor ever to have willingly given up the interest of his country but we are not to impute to his weakness what is only to be ascribed to the wisdom of those whom he opposed  'If this plea my lords is reasonable it will be  necessary for those who support the motion to prove not only that the treaty of Vinena was never made but that the falshood of the report either was or might have been known by our ministers otherwise those who are inclined to retain a favourable opinion of their integrity and abilities may conclude that they were either not mistaken or were led into error by such delusions as would no less easily have imposed on their accusers and that by exalting their enemies to their stations they shall not much consult the advantage of their country  'This motion therefore my lords founded upon no acknowledged no indisputable facts nor supported by legal evidence this motion which by appealing to common fame as the ultimate judge of every man's actions may bring every man's life or fortune into danger this motion which condemns without hearing and decides without examining I cannot but reject and hope your lordships will concur with me  Gent Mag page    This nervous speech was occasioned by one of the earl of Abingdon in support of the motion which he grounded on the evidence of common fame The drift of lord Hardwicke's speech is to invalidate that kind of testimony and in this he displays the talents of a sound lawyer and an eloquent orator but the private virtues of Sir Robert Walpole were such that few of his enemies wished for a greater punishment on him than the divesting him of power and accordingly the motion contained no specific charge of crimes that called for public justice it tended to shew that the minister had been inattentive to the complaints of the  merchants averse to the prosecution of the war and unskilful in the conduct of it and that the councils of the nation had not prospered under his influence and that these facts were notorious these were surely reasons for his removal and superseded the necessity of legal forms and that kind of evidence which is required to support a bill of attainder or an impeachment Lord Hardwicke's argument may therefore seem fallacious but it was admirably calculated to elude the charge he wilfully mistook the design of the motion and set himself to invalidate the kind of evidence on which it was grounded and to shew its insufficiency to support a legal prosecution and succeeding therein his opponents thought their arguments refuted when in truth they were not  The speech of Lord Chesterfield on a different subject and against a measure of a succeeding and as it was pretended a purer administration is as follows  'My Lords  'The bill now under our consideration appears to me to deserve a much closer regard than seems to have been paid to it in the other house through which it was hurried with the utmost precipitation and where it passed almost without the formality of a debate nor can I think that earnestness with which some lords seem inclined to press it forward here consistent with the importance of the consequences which may be with great reason expected from it  'It has been urged that where so great a number have formed expectations of a national benefit from any bill so much deference at least is due to their judgment as that the bill should be considered in a committee This my lords I admit to be in other cases a just and reasonable demand and will readily  allow that the proposal not only of a considerable number but even of any single lord ought to be fully examined and regularly debated according to the usual forms of this assembly But in the present case my lords and in all cases like the present the demand is improper because it is useless and it is useless because we can do now all that we can do hereafter in a committee For the bill before us is a moneybill which according to the present opinion of the clinabs  Commons  we have no right to amend and which therefore we have no need of considering in a committee since the event of all our deliberations must be that we are either to reject or pass it in its present state for I suppose no lord will think this a proper time to enter into a controversy with the clinabs for the revival of those privileges to which I believe we have a right and such a controversy the least attempt to amend a moneybill will certainly produce  'To desire therefore my lords that this bill may be considered in a committee is only to desire that it may gain one step without opposition that it may proceed through the forms of the house by stealth and that the consideration of it may be delayed till the exigencies of the government shall be so great as not to allow time for raising the supplies by any other method  'By this artifice gross as it is the patrons of this wonderful bill hope to obstruct a plain and open detection of its tendency They hope my lords that the bill shall operate in the same manner with the liquor which it is intended to bring into more general use and that as those that drink spirits are  drunk before they are well aware that they are drinking the effects of this law shall be perceived before we know that we have made it Their intent is to give us a dram of policy which is to be swallowed before it is tasted and which when once it is swallowed will turn our heads  'But my lords I hope we shall be so cautious as to examine the draught which these stateempirics have thought proper to offer us and I am confident that a very little examination will convince us of the pernicious qualities of their new preparation and shew that it can have no other effect than that of poisoning the public  'The law before us my lords seems to be the effect of that practice of which it is intended likewise to be the cause and to be dictated by the liquor of which it so effectually promotes the use for surely it never before was conceived by any man intrusted with the administration of public affairs to raise taxes by the destruction of the people  'Nothing my lords but the destruction of all the most laborious and useful part of the nation can be expected from the license which is now proposed to be given not only to drunkenness but to drunkenness of the most detestable and dangerous kind to the abuse not only of intoxicating but of poisonous liquors  'Nothing my lords is more absurd than to assert that the use of spirits will be hindered by the bill now before us or indeed that it will not be in a very great degree promoted by it For what produces all kind of wickedness but the prospect of impunity on one part or the solicitation of opportunity on  the other Either of these have too frequently been sufficient to overpower the sense of morality and even of religion and what is not to be feared from them when they shall unite their force and operate together when temptations shall be increased and terror taken away  'It is allowed by thosed who have hitherto disputed on either side of this question that the people appear obstinately enamoured of this new liquor it is allowed on both parts that this liquor corrupts the mind and enervates the body and destroys vigour and virtue at the same time that it makes those who drink it too idle and too feeble for work and while it impoverishes them by the present expence disables them from retrieving its ill consequences by subsequent industry  'It might be imagined my lords that those who had thus far agreed would not easily find any occasion of dispute nor would any man unacquainted with the motives by which senatorial debates are too often influenced suspect that after the pernicious qualities of this liquor and the general inclination among the people to the immoderate use of it had been generally admitted it could be afterwards enquired whether it ought to be made more common whether this universal thirst for poison ought to be encouraged by the legislature and whether a new statute ought to be made to secure drunkards in the gratification of their appetites  'To pretend my lords that the design of this bill is to prevent or diminish the use of spirits is to  trample upon common sense and to violate the rules of decency as well as of reason For when did any man hear that a commodity was prohibited by licensing its sale or that to offer and refuse is the same action  'It is indeed pleaded that it will be made dearer by the tax which is proposed and that the increase of the price will diminish the numbers of the purchasers but it is at the same time expected that this tax shall supply the expence of a war on the Continent It is asserted therefore that the consumption of spirits will be hindered and yet that it will be such as may be expected to furnish from a very small tax a revenue sufficient for the support of armies for the reestablishment of the Auristan  Austrian  family and the repression of the attempts of Blefuscu  France    'Surely my lords these expectations are not very consistent nor can it be imagined that they are both formed in the same head though they may be expressed by the same mouth It is however some recommendation of a statesman when of his assertions one can be found reasonable or true and in this praise cannot be denied to our present ministers for though it is undoubtedly false that this tax will lessen the consumption of spirits it is certainly true that it will produce a very large revenue a revenue that will not fail but with the people from whose debaucheries it arises  'Our ministers will therefore have the same honour with their predecessors of having given rise to a new fund not indeed for the payment of our debts  but for much more valuable purposes for the exaltation of our hearts under oppression for the elevation of our spirits amidst miscarriages and disappointments and for the chearful support of those debts which we have lost hopes of paying They are resolved my lords that the nation which nothing can make wise shall while they are at its head at least be merry and since public happiness is the end of government they seem to imagine that they shall deserve applause by an expedient which will enable every man to lay his cares asleep to drown sorrow and lose in the delights of drunkenness both the public miseries and his own  'Surely my lords men of this unbounded benevolence and this exalted genius deserve such honours as were never paid before they deserve to bestride a butt upon every signpost in the metropolis or to have their countenances exhibited as tokens where this liquor is to be sold by the license which they have procured They must be at least remembered to future ages as the happy politicians who after all expedients for raising taxes had been employed discovered a new method of draining the last reliques of the public wealth and added a new revenue to the government nor will those who shall hereafter enumerate the several funds now established among us forget among the benefactors to their country the illustrious authors of the drinking fund  'May I be allowed my lords to congratulate my countrymen and fellowsubjects upon the happy times which are now approaching in which no  man will be disqualified for the privilege of being drunk when all discontent and disloyalty shall be forgotten and the people though now considered by the ministry as their enemies shall acknowledge the lenity of that government under which all restraints are taken away  'But to a bill for such desirable purposes it would be proper my lords to prefix a preamble in which the kindness of our intentions should be more fully explained that the nation may not mistake our indulgence for cruelty nor consider their benenefactors as their persecutors If therefore this bill be considered and amended for why else should it be considered in a committee I shall humbly propose that it shall be introduced in this manner Whereas the designs of the present ministry whatever they are cannot be executed without a great number of mercenaries which mercenaries cannot be hired without money and whereas the present disposition of this nation to drunkenness inclines us to believe that they will pay more chearfully for the undisturbed enjoyment of distilled liquors than for any other concession that can be made by the government be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty that no man shall hereafter be denied the right of being drunk on the following conditions  'This my lords to trifle no longer is the proper preamble to this bill which contains only the conditions on which the people of this kingdom are to be allowed henceforward to riot in debauchery in debauchery licensed by law and countenanced by the magistrates for there is no doubt but those on whom  the inventors of this tax shall confer authority will be directed to assist their masters in their design to encourage the consumption of that liquor from which such large revenues are expected and to multiply without end those licenses which are to pay an yearly tribute to the crown  'By this unbounded license my lords that price will be lessened from the increase of which the expectations of the efficacy of this law are pretended for the number of retailers will lessen the value as in all other cases and lessen it more than this tax will increase it Besides it is to be considered that at present the retailer expects to be paid for the danger which he incurs by an unlawful trade and will not trust his reputation or his purse to the mercy of his customer without a profit proportioned to the hazard but when once the restraint shall be taken away he will sell for common gain and it can hardly be imagined that at present he subjects himself to informations and penalties for less than sixpence a gallon  'The specious pretence on which this bill is founded and indeed the only pretence that deserves to be termed specious is the propriety of taxing vice but this maxim of government has on this occasion been either mistaken or perverted Vice my lords is not properly to be taxed but suppressed and heavy taxes are sometimes the only means by which that suppression can be attained Luxury my lords or the excess of that which is pernicious only by its excess may very properly be taxed that such excess though not strictly unlawful may be made more difficult but the use of those things which  are simply hurtful hurtful in their own nature and in every degree is to be prohibited None my lords ever heard in any nation of a tax upon theft or adultery because a tax implies a license granted for the use of that which is taxed to all who shall be willing to pay it  'Drunkenness my lords is universally and in all circumstances an evil and therefore ought not to be taxed but punished and the means of it not to be made easy by a slight impost which none can feel but to be removed out of the reach of the people and secured by the heaviest taxes levied with the utmost rigour I hope those to whose care the religion of the nation is particularly consigned will unanimously join with me in maintaining the necessity not of taxing vice but suppressing it and unite for the rejection of a bill by which the future as well as the present happiness of thousands must be destroyed  Gent Mag page  '  This speech is a contrast to that of lord Hardwicke and to him who uttered it may be applied the character which bishop Burnet gives of Waller viz  'That he was only concerned to say that which should make him applauded he never laid the business of the house to heart being a vain and empty though a witty man'  The subject of this important debate was a bill to restrain the use of spirituous liquors founded on evidence that no less a quantity than seven millions of gallons thereof were yearly distilled and consumed in this country and that in many parishes within the  bills of mortality exclusive of London and Southwark every sixth house retailed them The bill under the influence of the duke of Newcastle lord Carteret Mr Sandys and others the then ministry passed the commons with little or no opposition and money was immediately raised on the tax thereby imposed In the house of lords it was vehemently opposed by the bishops and many of the lay lords with great force of reasoning and by lord Chesterfield in the above speech which has little of argument in it though it goes to prove that the practice ought to have been suppressed rather than tolerated It however passed and notwithstanding the subsequent laws since made to palliate it the evil to a great degree subsists at this day  In the perusal of these debates as written we cannot but wonder at the powers that produced them The author had never passed those gradations that lead to the knowledge of men and business born to a narrow fortune of no profession conversant chiefly with books and if we believe some so deficient in the formalities of discourse and the practices of ceremony as in conversation to be scarce tolerable unacquainted with the stile of any other than academical disputation and so great a stranger to senatorial manners that he never was within the walls of either house of parliament That a man under these disadvantages should be able to frame a system of debate to compose speeches of such excellence both in matter and form as scarcely to be equalled by those of the most able and experienced statesmen is I say matter of astonishment and a proof of talents that qualified him for a speaker in the most august assembly on earth  Cave who had no idea of the powers of eloquence over the human mind became sensible of its effects in the profits it brought him he had long thought that the success of his Magazine proceeded from those parts of it that were conducted by himself which were the abridgement of weekly papers written against the ministry such as the Craftsman Fog's Journal Common Sense the Weekly Miscellany the Westminster Journal and others and also marshalling the pastorals the elegies and the songs the epigrams and the rebuses that were sent him by various correspondents and was scarcely able to see the causes that at this time increased the sale of his pamphlet from ten to fifteen thousand copies a month But if he saw not he felt them and manifested his good fortune by buying an old coach and a pair of older horses and that he might avoid the suspicion of pride in setting up an equipage he displayed to the world the source of his affluence by a representation of St John's gate instead of his arms on the doorpannel This he told me himself was the reason of distinguishing his carriage from others by what some might think a whimsical device and also for causing it to be engraven on all his plate  Johnson had his reward over and above the pecuniary recompence vouchsafed him by Cave in the general applause of his labours which the increased demand for the Magazine implied but this as his performances fell short of his powers gratified him but little on the contrary he disapproved the deceit he was compelled to practice his notions of morality were so strict that he would scarcely allow the violation of truth in the most trivial instances and saw in falshood  of all kinds a turpitude that the could never be thoroughly reconciled to and though the fraud was perhaps not greater than the fictitious relations in Sir Thomas More's Utopia lord Bacon's Nova Atlantis and bishop Hall's Mundus alter et idem Johnson was not easy till he had disclosed the deception  In the mean time it was curious to observe how the deceit operated It has above been remarked that Johnson had the art to give different colours to the several speeches so that some appear to be declamatory and energetic resembling the orations of Demosthenes others like those of Cicero calm persuasive others more particularly those attributed to such countrygentlemen merchants and seamen as had seats in parliament bear the characteristic of plainness bluntness and an affected honesty as opposed to the plausibility of such as were understood or suspected to be courtiers the artifice had its effect Voltaire was betrayed by it into a declaration that the eloquence of ancient Greece and Rome was revived in the British senate and a speech of the late earl of Chatham when Mr Pitt in opposition to one of Mr Horatio Walpole received the highest applause and was by all that red it taken for genuine  The speech here aliuded to taking it to have been spoken as it is printed was uttered in a debate on a bill for the encouragement and encrease of seamen containing a clause for a register of seamen and was intended to take away the necessity of impressing for the seaservice which bill as being a ministerial measure was vehemently opposed It is a reply void of argument and loaded with abuse to a sober reproof of a grave and experienced senator To judge of its merits and as a specimen of the speaker's method of debating at that early period of his life it is necessary to compare it with that to which it pretends to be an answer and for that purpose both are here inserted and first that of Mr Walpole  'SIR  'I was unwilling to interrupt the course of this debate while it was carried on with calmness and decency by men who do not suffer the ardour of opposition to cloud their reason or transport them to such expressions as the dignity of this assembly does not admit I have hitherto deferred to answer the gentleman who declaimed against the bill with such fluency of rhetoric and such vehemence of gesture who charged the advocates for the expedients now proposed with having no regard to any interest but their own and with making laws only to consume paper and threatened them with the defection of their adherents and the loss of their influence upon this new discovery of their folly and their ignorance  'Nor Sir do I now answer him for any other purpose than to remind him how little the clamours of rage and petulancy of invectives contribute to the purposes for which this assembly is called together how little the discovery of truth is promoted and the security of the nation established by pompous diction and theatrical emotions  'Formidable sounds and furious declamations confident assertions and lofty periods may affect the young and unexperienced and perhaps the gentleman may have contracted his habits of oratory by conversing more with those of his own age than with such as have had more opportunities of acquiring knowledge and more successful methods of communicating their sentiments  'If the heat of his temper Sir would suffer him to attend to those whose age and long acquaintance with business give them an indisputable right to deference and superiority he would learn in time to reason rather than declaim and to prefer justness of argument and an accurate knowledge of facts to sounding epithets and splendid superlatives which may disturb the imagination for a moment but leave no lasting impression on the mind  'He will learn Sir that to accuse and prove are very different and that reproaches unsupported by evidence affect only the character of him that utters them Excursions of fancy and flights of oratory are indeed pardonable in young men but in no other and it would surely contribute more even to the purpose for which some gentlemen appear to speak that of depreciating the conduct of the administration to prove the inconveniences and injustice of this bill than barely to assert them with whatever magnificence of language or appearance of zeal honesty or compassion  To this sober and temperate speech uttered by a grave senator who had served his country in various capacities and whose moral character was irreproachable the following was the answer of Mr William Pitt  'SIR  'The atrocious crime of being a young man which the honourable gentleman has with such spirit and decency charged upon me I shall neither attempt to palliate nor deny but content myself with wishing that I may be one of those whose follies may cease with their youth and not of that number who are ignorant in spite of experience  'Whether youth can be imputed to any man as a reproach I will not Sir assume the province of determining but surely age may become justly contemptible if the opportunities which it brings have passed away without improvement and vice appears to prevail when the passions have subsided The wretch that after having seen the consequences of a thousand errors continues still to blunder and whose age has only added obstinacy to stupidity is surely the object of either abhorrence or contempt and deserves not that his grey head should secure him from insults  'Much more Sir is he to be abhorred who as he has advanced in age has receded from virtue and becomes more wicked with less temptation who prostitutes himself for money which he cannot enjoy and spends the remains of his life in the ruin of his country  'But youth Sir is not my only crime I have been accused of acting a theatrical part A theatrical part may either imply some peculiarities of gesture or a dissimulation of my real sentiments and an adoption of the opinions and language of another man  'In the first sense Sir the charge is too trifling to be confuted and deserves only to be mentioned that it may be despised I am at liberty like every other man to use my own language and though I may perhaps have some ambition to please this gentleman I shall not lay myself under any restraint nor very solicitously copy his diction or his mien however matured by age or modelled by experience  'If any man shall by charging me with theatrical behaviour imply that I utter any sentiments but my own I shall treat him as a calumniator and a villain nor shall any protection shelter him from the treatment which he deserves I shall on such an occasion without scruple trample upon all those forms with which wealth and dignity intrench themselves nor shall any thing but age restrain my resentment Age which always brings one privilege that of being insolent and supercilious without punishment  'But with regard Sir to those whom I have offended I am of opinion that if I had acted a borrowed part I should have avoided their censure the heat that offended them is the ardour of conviction and that zeal for the service of my country which neither hope nor fear shall influence me to suppress I will not sit unconcerned while my liberty is invaded nor look in silence upon public robbery I will exert my endeavours at whatever hazard to repel the aggressor and drag the thief to justice whoever may protect them in their villany and whoever may partake of their plunder And if the honourable gentlemanAt these words Mr Winnington rose up and calling Mr Pitt to order made a short speech to which Mr Pitt made this answer  'If this be to preserve order there is no danger of indecency from the most licentious tongue for what calumny can be more atrocious or what reproach more severe than that of speaking with regard to any thing but truth Order may sometimes be broken by passion or inadvertency but will hardly be reestablished by monitors like this who cannot govern his own passion whilst he is restraining the impetuosity of others  'Happy Sir would it be for mankind if every one knew his own province we should not then see the same man at once a criminal and a judge nor would this gentleman assume the right of dictating to others what he has not learned himself  'That I may return in some degree the favour which he intends me I will advise him never hereafter to exert himself on the subject of order but whenever he finds himself inclined to speak on such occasions to remember how he has now succeeded and condemn in silence what his censures will never reform  Gent Mag page et seqq  '  and we are further  told of a person in a high office under the government who being at breakfast at a gentleman's chambers in  Gray's inn Johnson being also there declared that by the style alone of the speeches in the debates he  could severally assign them to the persons by whom they were delivered Johnson upon hearing this could  not refrain from undeceiving him by confessing that himself was the author of them all  It must be owned that with respect to the general principles avowed in the speeches and the sentiments therein contained they agree with the characters of the persons to whom they are ascribed Thus to instance in those of the upper house the speeches of the duke of Newcastle the lords Carteret and Ilay are calm temperate and persuasive those of the duke of Argyle and lord Talbot furious and declamatory and lord Chesterfield's and lord Hervey's florid but flimsy In the other house the speeches may be thus characterised the minister's mild and conciliatory Mr Pulteney's  nervous methodical and weighty Mr Shippen's blunt and dogmatical Sir John Barnard's clear especially on commercial subjects Lyttelton's stiff and imitative of the Roman oratory and Pitt's void of argument but rhapsodically and diffusively eloquent  Mr Pitt professed himself to be no reasoner In the meetings of his party to settle the method of conducting a debate in opposition to the minister he declined the enforcing particular charges of maladministration and always chose what he called the peroration  In other particulars the debates of Johnson are liable to the same objections but in a greater degree as those of Guthrie the language of them is too good and the style such as none of the persons to whom the speeches are assigned were able to discourse in  The confession of Johnson abovementioned was the first that revealed the secret that the debates inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine were fictitious and composed by himself After that he was free and indeed industrious in the communication of it for being informed that Dr Smollet was writing a history of England and had brought it down to the last reign he cautioned him not to rely on the debates as given in the Magazine for that they were not authentic but excepting as to their general import the work of his own imagination  As the subjects of these debates are at this time become very little interesting I shall not attempt farther than I have already done to embellish these memoirs by a selection of any of those nervous arguments or eloquent passages with which they abound and the rather as it is impossible in the relation of a conflict between two contending parties to determine the merits of their several pretensions or distinguish between  specious and sound reasoning In the attempts to remove the minister experience has however convinced us that ambition and personal resentment were the motives that actuated his opponents for neither when they attained to power did they manifest greater integrity nor did they cease to practise those methods for the maintaining their influence over the public councils which were imputed to him as criminal  It is beside my purpose to enter into a formal defence of the administration of this servant of the public or to attempt a detection of the arts that were practised to render him odious I will nevertheless mention a few facts respecting him that have come to my own knowledge and may serve to exculpate him in some degree from the charge of being an enemy to the constitution or the interests of this country  When he first came into power he found it his duty to undertake the arduous task of reconciling the people to the dominion of a prince born in a foreign country and securing the succession to his descendants and this he lived to see effected War he hated as much as some of his successors did peace and from a war with Spain he foresaw that no good could follow the settlements abroad of that power are very remote and in a climate destructive to Englishmen so that what we were ever able to take from them we never could hold The extension of empire was never his wish but the encouragement of commerce and the improvement of the revenue in both which subjects his skill was unrivalled engrossed his attention To effect the one a greater number of laws in its favour were framed and  passed under his sanction than had ever been enacted in any known period of equal duration with his ministry and to carry the other into practice he projected a scheme for an extension of the excise as the only means of putting a stop to the frauds of merchants and illicit traders and making the receipts of that branch of the public income equal to what they were computed at This scheme it is true subjected him to much obloquy and he was necessitated to abandon it but in a succeeding administration it was partly carried into execution at the express solicitation of the principal persons concerned in that article of trade which it was suggested would have been most affected had the scheme passed into a law and afterwards the most popular minister that ever directed the councils of this country scrupled not to declare in full senate that if ever a time should arrive that was likely to render the project feasible himself would recommend an extension of the exciselaws as a measure big with advantage to commerce to the revenue and to the general interests of the kingdom  The question whether he was in principle an enemy to his country or not will possibly be decided by the following fact which the best authority warrants me in relating When he was seized with the disorder that put a period to his days and from its violence he had abandoned the hope of living much longer he called one of his sons to him gave him his blessing and with tears in his eyes told him that from intelligence he had obtained he would assure him that within a twelvemonth's time the crown of England would be fought for upon English ground the subsequent  rebellion in and the irruptions of the enemy beyond the borders of the north verified this prediction  As I shall have but little occasion to say more of the debates in parliament as they appear in the Magazine I shall close the account above given of them with saying that Johnson continued to write them till the passing the bill for restraining the sale of spirituous liquors which was about the end of the year After that they were written by Dr Hawkesworth and by him continued to about within which period the plan of the Magazine was enlarged by a review of new publications In this Mr Owen Ruffhead was first employed but he being in about two years invited to superinted a republication of the Statutes at large the office of reviewer dropped into the hands of Dr Hawkesworth who though he was thought to exercise it with some asperity continued in it till about the year when he was employed to digest the papers of sundry late navigators and to become the editor of that collection of voyages which in the catalogues of booksellers is distinguished by his name  About this time Johnson was solicited to undertake an employment of a kind very different from any he had ever been accustomed to it was to compile a catalogue of books a task which at first view seems to be not above the capacity of almost the lowest of literary artificers but on a nearer was found to require the abilities of one of the highest Osborne the bookseller had ventured on the purchase of the earl of Oxford's library of printed books at the price of l and meaning to dispose of them by sale  at his shop in the ordinary way projected a catalogue thereof distributed into commonplaces in five octavo volumes which being sold for five shillings each would pay itself and circulate throughout the kingdom and also abroad  It is probable that Osborne had consulted Maittaire then one of the masters of Westminster school and who had formerly assisted in making out the Catalogus librorum manuscriptorum Angliae Hiberniae on the subject of his intended catalogue and that Maittaire might have furnished the general heads or classes under which the several books are arranged a work of some labour and that required no small stock of erudition This at least is certain that he drew up a Latin dedication of the whole to Lord Carteret then secretary of state and subscribed it with his name but the underworkmen were as I conjecture first Oldys and afterwards Johnson who while he was engaged in so servile an employment resembled a lion in harness The former of these persons was a natural son of Dr Oldys a civilian of some eminence and subsisted by writing for the booksellers Having a general knowledge of books he had been long retained in the service of Edward earl of Oxford and was therefore by Osborne thought a fit person for his purpose but whether they disagreed or that Oldys was hindered by the restraint of his person in the Fleet a misfortune that he laboured under some time about that period he desisted after having proceeded to the end of the second volume The third and fourth I conceive to be the work of Johnson  At what part of the catalogue Oldys's labours ended and Johnson's begin I have no express authority for saying It is related of Johnson by a person who was very likely to know the fact that he was employed by Osborne to make  'a catalogue of the Harleian Library'  and if not to make such remarks on the books as are above inserted an ordinary hand would have done as well but it required the learning of a scholar to furnish such intelligence as the catalogue contains This is one of the facts on which I ground my assertion that Johnson worked on the catalogue to discriminate between his notes and those of Oldys is not easy as literary curiosities and as a specimen of a great work they nevertheless deserve attention  the fifth is nothing more than a catalogue of Osborne's old stock  The catalogue of the Harleian printed books for of the manuscripts there is another in being drawn up by an able hand is of that kind which philologists call Bibliotheque Raisonée in which besides the title and the colophon containing the place and year of publication a description of each article is given serving to shew both its intrinsic and extrinsic worth the hands through which it has passed and various other particulars that tend to recommend it I will select a few examples of this kind from the third volume and leave the reader to applaud the judgment of Osborne in appointing so able a man as Johnson to this laborious task and the industry and perseverance of the latter in the performance of it  'No The Antiquities of StoneHenge on Salisbury plain restored by Inigo Jones architectgeneral to the King published by J Webb  'This book has its margins sides tops and bottoms in many leaves almost written throughout with some of the strangest notes perhaps to be met with no ways relating to the subjectmatter nor to one another  except in one or two places The book is inscribed by  J Webb  to  Philip  earl of  Pembroke  and  Montgomery  some time lordchamberlain to King  Charles  I and chancellor of  Oxford  And it had been his own copy for the said earl has in the next leaf writ his own name which is apparently the same hand with that in which all those marginal eruptions of his memory and imagination were written Some following possessor or reader of this book discovering the said writing to be his lordship's has written in the margin against his name  "This  Philip  earl of  Pembroke  and  Montgomery  was the writer of these wild notes  A Wood  would have less belied him in calling him a madman than in saying he was illiterate and could not write his name"  The notes are written in  Latin French  and  English  in prose and verse containing truth fiction trifles matters of useful intelligence some enough to make you merry others melancholy He seems to have been under the displeasure of  Cromwell  and his daughters Of the former he says  "  Ravilliac Cromuell  is to be pulled a pieces with wild horses upon  London  streets and then to be hanged drawn c not decapited in jest" p  In the same page where he has writ his name he has these words  "If he be mad as my lady  Harwood  sais whose tongue is no slaunder it is rather for wanting the pounds a year his father promised to give  him than that he thinks pounds a year too much for him to manage with Wilton and Ramsbury for he is very learnedly proud and proudly learned"  In several places he has mentioned  Inigo Jones  the King's surveyor affirming in one place  "He had for years together sixteen thousand pounds a year for keeping the King's houses in repair and yet they lay worse than any house in  Turnball  street" P  But in one place he augments his salary very much when he says  "  Hinnico Jones  alias  Iniquity Jones  a justice of peace and of the  Quorum  i and  Custos Rotulorum  hath for keeping the King's houses in repair  deux cens mil escu per an  threescore thousand pounds sterling a year i and well paid He is fourscore years ould" P  c c'  'No Glossarium Archaiologicum Authore Henrico Spelmanno Equite  'Because it had been intimated as if the latter part of this famous work now first published with the former and makes it complete was not that learned author's own to whom it is ascribed Dr  Robert Brady  has satisfied the world of this particular in the following curious anecdote  "The first part of the  Glossary  to the letter N was published in the year the whole being then finished and offered by Sir  Henry Spelman  to Mr  Bill  the King's printer for the value of five pounds in books only but  he refusing to give him that small rate for the copy he ventured to print the first part of it at his own charge and most of the books lay upon his hands until the latter end of the year when Mr  Stephens  and Mr  Meredith  booksellers in St  Paul's  churchyard took them off The next year viz Sir  William Dugdale  being with Sir  Henry Spelman  and telling him that many learned men were very desirous to see the remaining part of that work Sir  Henry  then told him what is here related and produced  both parts  of the  Glossary  the first whereof was printed and interleaved with blank leaves as also was the second which was in manuscript wherein he had added and altered much After his Majesty's  restauration  the earl of  Clarendon  then lordchancellor and Dr  Sheldon  then bishop of  London  inquired of Sir  William Dugdale  what was become of the remaining part of the  Glossary  or whether ever it was finished He told them it was finished and in the hands of Mr  Charles Spelman  grandchild to Sir  Henry  and youngest son to Sir  John  Whereupon they desired Sir  William  to move him to print it which he did but finding that the booksellers would give  nothing  for the copy and that he was not able to print it at his own charge and returning this answer to the lord chancellor and bishop of  London  they contributed liberally themselves and procuring many  subscriptions to that purpose desired Sir  William Dugdale  to receive the money and deal with a printer to perform the work which he did and caused it to be printed as he received it all under the proper handwriting of Sir  Henry Spelman  without alteration or addition And had it not been for the dreadful fire in  London  wherein both the copy and the greatest part of the impression were consumed it might at this day have been produced to have confirmed what is here reported For the truth whereof Sir  William Dugdale  a person of great learning worth and integrity and now a living testimony without exception may be consulted if any man doubts what is here delivered See  Animadversions upon a book called Jani Anglorum Facies Nova  p annexed to an  Answer to a book written by William Petit  Esq  vo "  'No Missale Mixtum secundum Regulam Beati Isidori dictum Mozarabes Toleti  'This is the scarcest book in the whole  Harleian  collection At the end of it are the following words which deserve to be inserted here  "  Ad laudem omnipotentis Dei nec non Virginis  Mariae  matris ejus omnium sanctorum sanctarum{que} expletum est missale mixtum secundum regulam beati  Isidori  dictum  Mozarabes  Maxima cum diligentia perlectum

supposed to be the ancient missal amended and purged by St  Isidore  archbishop of  Sevil  and ordered by the council of  Toledo  to be used in all churches every one of which before that time had a missal peculiar to itself The  Moors  afterwards committing great ravages in  Spain  destroying the churches and throwing every thing there both civil and sacred into confusion all St  Isidore's  missals excepting those in the city of  Toledo  were lost But those were preserved even after the  Moors  had made themselves masters of that city since they left six of the churches there to the  Christians  and granted them the free exercise of their religion  Alphonsus  the sixth many ages afterwards expelled the  Moors  from  Toledo  and ordered the  Roman  missal to be used in those churches where St  Isidore's  missal had been in vogue ever since the council abovementioned But the people of  Toledo  insisting that their missal was drawn up by the most ancient bishops revised and corrected by St  Isidore  proved to be the best  by the great number of saints who had followed it and been preserved during the whole time of the  Moorish  government in  Spain  he could not bring his project to bear without great difficulty In short the contest between the  Roman  and  Toletan  missals came to that height that according to the genius of the age it was decided by a single combat wherein the champion of the  Toletan  missal proved victorious But King  Alphonso  say some of the  Spanish  writers not being satisfied with this which he considered as the effect of chance only ordered a fast to be proclaimed and a great fire to be then made into which after the King and people had prayed fervently to God for his assistance in this affair both the missals were thrown but the  Toletan  only escaped the violence of the flames This continue the same authors made such an impression upon the King that he permitted the citizens of  Toledo  to use their own missal in those churches that had been granted the  Christians  by the  Moors  However the copies of this missal grew afterwards so scarce thar cardinal  Ximenes  found it extremely difficult to meet with one of them which induced him to order this impression and to build a chapel in which this service was chanted every day as it had at first been by the antient  Christians  But notwithstanding this the copies of the  Toletan  missal are become now so exceeding rare that it  is at present almost in as much danger of being buried in oblivion as it was when committed to the press by cardinal  Ximenes  'No All the workes of John Taylor the water poet being sixty and three in number collected into one volume by the author with sundry new additions corrected revised and newly imprinted  'These works consist of several pieces partly serious but mostly comical in prose as well as verse which the author had published from time to time in single pamphlets He frankly owns himself no scholar but being a man of good natural parts of a ready and copious invention and having travelled much and seen company of all sorts he has in many things made good use especially in the satirical vein of his fancy and observations Several of the nobility c encouraged him and to them he dedicates several of these tracts There are also commendatory verses before many of them by some ingenious writers Among the

the Thames at any place to be fixed on by Taylor himself betwixt London and Richmond Being a waterman by trade he had a mortal hatred to coaches and wrote a bitter but very diverting invective against them and upon a suggestion that the watermen were starving for want of employment preferred a petition to King James I which was referred to certain commissioners of whom Sir Francis Bacon was one the object whereof was to obtain a prohibition of all playhouses but those on the bank side that the greater part of those who were desirous of seeing plays might be compelled to go by water Taylor himself solicited this petition and was prepared to oppose before the commissioners the reasons of the players but the commission was dissolved before it came to a hearing  '  Of this stupendous work the Harleian catalogue it is difficult to give an idea save by such extracts as those above and others in Latin of a like kind Prefixed to it is a Latin dedication to lord Carteret by Mr Michael Maittaire dated February and after that a preface doubtless drawn up by Johnson beginning  'To solicit a subscription for a catalogue of books exposed to sale'  wherein with great learning and no less judgment he points out the excellence and extent of the collection urges those arguments which should induce men of learning to become purchasers and anticipates whatever objections could be made to this uncommon species of catalogue and the method of circulating it  The several articles are distributed in the order of a common place that does honour to Johnson and Maittaire who are supposed to have been jointly the framers of it Here follows a specimen of the subdivision of the first of the heads therein contained viz Theology  Biblia Sacra  Polyglotta  Hebraica  Graeca  Nov Testamentum

for it to this end it was that he directed Johnson to draw up the preface giving an account of the contents of the library and containing a variety of arguments to vindicate a solicitation for a subscription that is to  say a demand of five shillings for each volume of the catalogue to defray the expence of printing it the volume or volumes so purchased to be taken in exchange for any book rated at the same value This paper of which a character has already been given was as I conjecture a precursor to the catalogue and was with great industry circulated throughout the kingdom It answered its end the catalogue was printed in five octavo volumes the collectors and lovers of books bought it and Osborne was reimbursed  While the catalogue was compiling Johnson was further employed by Osborne to select from the many thousand volumes of which the library consisted all such small tracts and fugitive pieces as were of greatest value or were most scarce with a view to the reprinting and publishing them under the title of the Harleian Miscellany To recommend a subscription for printing the collection proposals were published containing an account of the undertaking and an enumeration of its contents penned by Johnson with great art which being very short may itself be deemed a fugitive piece and is therefore here inserted  'It has been for a long time a very just complaint among the learned that a multitude of valuable productions published in small pamphlets or in single sheets are in a short time too often by accidents or negligence destroyed and entirely lost and that those authors whose reverence for the public has hindered them from swelling their works with repetitions or incumbering them with superfluities and who therefore deserve the praise and gratitude of  posterity are forgotten for the very reason for which they might expect to be remembered It has been long lamented that the duration of the monuments of genius and study as well as of wealth and power depends in no small measure on their bulk and that volumes considerable only for their size are handed down from one age to another when compendious treatises of far greater importance are suffered to perish as the compactest bodies sink into the water while those of which the extension bears a greater proportion to the weight float upon the surface  'This observation hath been so often confirmed by experience that in the neighbouring nation the common appellation of small performances is derived from this unfortunate circumstance a  flying sheet  or a  fugitive piece  are the terms by which they are distinguished and distinguished with too great propriety as they are subject after having amused mankind for a while to take their flight and disappear for ever  'What are the losses which the learned have already sustained by having neglected to fix those fugitives in some certain residence it is not easy to say but there is no doubt that many valuable observations have been repeated because they were not preserved and that therefore the progress of knowledge has been retarded by the necessity of doing what had been already done but was done for those who forgot their benefactor  'The obvious method of preventing these losses of preserving to every man the reputation he has merited by long assiduity is to unite these scattered  pieces into volumes that those which are too small to preserve themselves may be secured by their combination with others to consolidate these atoms of learning into systems to collect these disunited rays that their light and their fire may become perceptible  'Of encouraging this useful design the studious and inquisitive have now an opportunity which perhaps was never offered them before and which if it should now be lost there is not any probability that they will ever recover They may now conceive themselves in possession of the lake into which all those rivulets of science have for many years been flowing but which unless its waters are turned into proper channels will soon burst its banks or be dispersed in imperceptible exhalations  'In the Harleian library which I have purchased are treasured a greater number of pamphlets and small treatises than were perhaps ever yet seen in one place productions of the writers of all parties and of every age from the reformation collected with an unbounded and unwearied curiosity without exclusion of any subject  'So great is the variety that it has been no small labour to peruse the titles in order to reduce them to a rude division and range their heaps under general heads of which the number though not yet increased by the subdivision which an accurate survey will necessarily produce cannot but excite the curiosity of all the studious as there is scarcely any part of knowledge which some of these articles do not comprehend  Then follows an enumeration of articles to the amount of more than an hundred and fifty which it is needless here to insert  'As many of these tracts must be obscure by length of time or defective for want of those discoveries which have been made since they were written there will be added some historical explanatory or supplemental notes in which the occasion of the treatise will be shewn or an account given of the author allusions to forgotten facts will be illustrated or the subject farther elucidated from other writers'  We may well conclude that the proposal met with all due encouragement as the pieces recommended in it were in the year published in eight quarto volumes To the first of them was prefixed as an introduction an essay on the origin and importance of small tracts and fugitive pieces  Osborne was an opulent tradesman as may be judged from his ability to make so large a purchase as that abovementioned he was used to boast that he was worth forty thousand pounds but of booksellers he was one of the most ignorant of titlepages or editions he had no knowledge or remembrance but in all the tricks and arts of his trade he was most expert Johnson in his life of Pope says that he was entirely destitute of shame without sense of any disgrace but that of poverty He purchased a number of unsold copies of Mr Pope's Iliad of the folio size printed on an inferior paper and without cuts and cutting off the top and bottom margins which were very large had the impudence to call them the subscription books and  to vend them as such  See a note on the Dunciad Book ii verse in the later editions  His insolence to his customers was also frequently past bearing If one came for a book in his catalogue he would endeavour to force on him some new publication of his own and if he refused would affront him  I mention the above particulars of this worthless fellow as an introduction to a fact respecting his behaviour to Johnson which I have often heard related and which himself confessed to be true Johnson while employed in selecting pieces for the Harleian Miscellany was necessitated not only to peruse the titlepage of each article but frequently to examine its contents in order to form a judgment of its worth and importance in the doing whereof it must be supposed curiosity might sometimes detain him too long and whenever it did Osborne was offended Seeing Johnson one day deeply engaged in perusing a book and the work being for the instant at a stand he reproached him with inattention and delay in such coarse language as few men would use and still fewer could brook the other in his justification asserted somewhat which Osborne answered by giving him the lie Johnson's anger at so soul a charge was not so great as to make him forget that he had weapons at hand he seized a folio that lay near him and with it felled his adversary to the ground with some exclamation which as it is differently related I will not venture to repeat  This transaction which has been seldom urged with any other view than to shew that Johnson was of  an irascible temper is generally related as an entertaining story with me it has always been a subject of melancholy reflection In our estimation of the enjoyments of this life we place wisdom virtue and learning in the first class and riches and other adventitious gifts of fortune in the last The natural subordination of the one to the other we see and approve and when that is disturbed we are sorry How then must it affect a sensible mind to contemplate that misfortune which could subject a man endued with a capacity for the highest offices a philosopher a poet an orator and if fortune had so ordered a chancellor a prelate a statesman to the insolence of a mean worthless ignorant fellow who had nothing to justify the superiority he exercised over a man so endowed but those advantages which Providence indiscriminately dispenses to the worthy and the worthless to see such a man for the supply of food and raiment submitting to the commands of his inferior and as a hireling looking up to him for the reward of his work and receiving it accompanied with reproach and contumely this I say is a subject of melancholy reflection  Having completed the Harleian catalogue and miscellany and thereby disengaged himself from Osborne Johnson was at liberty to pursue some scheme of profit less irksome than that in which he had so lately been employed Biography was a kind of writing that he delighted in it called forth his powers of reflection and gave him occasion to contemplate human life and manners He had made some essays of his talent in the lives of Barretier and Boerhaave men unknown to him and was now prompted to give to the  world that of a friend with whom he had been closely intimate whose singular character and adverse fortunes afforded ample scope for discussion and furnished matter for many admirable lessons of morality  This friend was Savage of whom it has above been related that his friends had undertaken to raise an annual subscription for his support at Swansea in Wales but that his departure for that place was retarded by some difficulties that occurred in the course of their endeavours to raise it these however were overcome and Savage in July took leave of London and also of Johnson who as himself tells us parted from him with tears in his eyes His subsequent history is that taking his way through Bristol he was for some time detained there by an embargo on the shipping After some stay he was enabled to depart and he reached Swansea but not liking the place and resenting the treatment of his contributors who seem to have been slack in the performance of their engagements to support him he returned to Bristol with an intent to come to London a purpose he was hindered from effecting by an arrest of his person on the th of January for the small sum of eight pounds and carried to Newgate in that city where not being able to extricate himself from his confinement he on the st day of July in the same year died  This event and the affection which he had long entertained for the man called forth Johnson to an exercise of his pen which as it is said employed it only thirtysix hours in a narrative of events so singular  as could scarcely fail to gratify the curiosity of every one who wished to be instructed in the science of human life The subject was such an one as is seldom exhibited to view a man dropped into the world as from a cloud committed to the care of those who had little interest in his preservation and none in the forming his temper or the infusing into him those little precepts of morality which might germinate in his mind and be productive of habitual virtue these are advantages which children of the lowest birth enjoy in some degree in common with those of a higher but of these he never participated All the knowledge he attained to from his infancy upwards was selfacquired and bating that he was born in a city where the refinements of civil life presented to his view a rule of moral conduct he may be said to have been little less a miracle than Hai Ebn Yokdhan is feigned to be  It has been observed of those children who owe their nurture and education to a certain benevolent institution in this metropolis that being by their misfortune strangers to those charities that arise from the relations of father son and brother their characters assume a complexion that marks their conduct through life The same may be said of Savage and will perhaps account for that want of gratitude to his benefactors and other defects in his temper with which he seems to have been justly chargeable  The manner in which Johnson has written this life is very judicious it afforded no great actions to celebrate no improvements in science to record nor any variety of events to remark on It was a succession  of disappointments and a complication of miseries and as it was an uniform contradiction to the axiom that human life is chequered with good and evil accidents was alone singular The virtues and vices which like flowers and weeds sprang up together and perhaps with an equal degree of vigour in the mind of this unfortunate man afforded it is true a subject of speculation and Johnson has not failed to avail himself of so extraordinary a moral phenomenon as that of a mind exalted to a high degree of improvement without the aid of culture  But if the events of Savage's life are few the reflections thereon are many so that the work may as well be deemed a series of oeconomical precepts as a narrative of facts In it is contained a character which may be said to be  sui generis  a woman who had proclaimed her crimes and solicited reproach disowning from the instant of his birth and procuring to be illegitimated by parliament her own son dooming him to poverty and obscurity and launching him upon the ocean of life only that he might be swallowed by its quicksands or dashed upon its rocks and lastly endeavouring to rid herself from the danger of being at any time made known to him by secretly sending him to the American plantations  It farther exhibits to view a man of genius destitute of relations and friends and with no one to direct his pursuits becoming an author by necessity and a writer for the stage and forming such connections as that profession leads to sometimes improving and at others slighting them but at all times acting with a spirit that better became his birth than his circumstances  for who that knew how to distinguish between one and the other would like Savage have solicited assistance and spurned at the offer of it or repaid reiterated kindnesses with neglect or oblivious taciturnity  Interspersed in the course of the narrative are a great variety of moral sentiments prudential maxims and miscellaneous observations on men and things but the sentiment that seems to pervade the whole is that idleness whether voluntary or necessitated is productive of the greatest evils that human nature is exposed to and this the author exemplifies in an enumeration of the calamities that a man is subjected to by the want of a profession and by shewing how far less happy such an one must be than he who has only a mere manual occupation to depend on for his support  The concluding paragraph of the book explains the author's intention in writing it and points out the use that may be made of it in such pointed terms that I shall need as I trust no excuse for inserting so fine a specimen of stile and sentiment  'This relation will not be wholly without its use if those who languish under any part of his sufferings shall be enabled to fortify their patience by reflecting that they feel only those afflictions from which the abilities of Savage did not exempt him or if those who in confidence of superior capacities or attainments disregard the common maxims of life shall be reminded that nothing will supply the want of prudence and that negligence and irregularity long continued will make knowledge useless wit ridiculous and genius contemptible'  This celebrated essay in biography was published in the month of February and gave occasion to Henry Fielding the author of a periodical paper intitled  'The Champion'  to commend it in these words  'This pamphlet is without flattery to its author as just and well written a piece as of its kind I ever saw so that at the same time that it highly deserves it stands certainly very little in need of this recommendationAs to the history of the unfortunate person whose memoirs compose this work it is certainly penned with equal accuracy and spirit of which I am so much the better judge as I knew many of the facts mentioned in it to be strictly true and very fairly related Besides it is not only the story of Mr Savage but innumerable incidents relating to other persons and other affairs which render this a very amusing and withal a very instructive and valuable performance The author's observations are short significant and just as his narrative is remarkably smooth and well disposed his reflections open to us all the recesses of the human heart and in a word a more just or pleasant a more engaging or a more improving treatise on the excellencies and defects of human nature is scarce to be found in our own or perhaps in any other language'  The life I am now writing seems to divide itself into two periods the first marked by a series of afflictions the last by some cheering rays of comfort and comparative affluence Johnson at this time had passed nearly the half of his days here therefore let me make a stand and having hitherto represented  him in his literary endeavour to exhibit him in his religious moral and oeconomical character adverting first to such particulars respecting the course of life he had chosen and the evils to which it exposed him as seem properly to belong to the first member of the above division  As the narrowness of his father's circumstances had shut him out of those professions for which an university education is a necessary qualification and his project of an academy had failed he had as to his course of life no choice but idleness or the exercise of his talents in a way that might afford him subsistence and provide for the day that was passing over him so that the profession of an author was the only one in his power to adopt That it was far from an eligible one he had in some degree experienced and his aversion to labour magnified the evils of it by bringing to his recollection the examples of Amhurst of Savage of Boyse  The lives of these three persons as they exhibit an example of the distresses to which idleness and the want of moral principles may expose men of parts may be an useful caveat to young men of the rising generation and prove a more powerful persuasive to industry oeconomy and the right use of great talents than the most laboured argument That of Savage presents itself to view in the works of Johnson those of the other two are elsewhere to be found and an abridgement of each of them is inserted for the same reason that beacons are erected to point out rocks and shoals to ignorant or benighted persons  Nicholas Amhurst was born at Marden in Kent but in what year is uncertain he received his education in MerchantTaylors' school in London and was thence removed to St John's college Oxford but expelled for the libertinism of his principles and the irregularity of his conduct After this expulsion for which very different causes were assigned by him and those who enforced it he satirized the learning and discipline of the university and exposed the characters of its most respectable members in a poem called  'Oculus Britanniae'  and in his  'Terrae Filius'  a work compounded of wit and scurrility He soon after quitted Oxford came to London and published a volume of miscellanies he wrote many satirical and malignant poems and translated some of Mr Addison's Latin pieces but his chief fame arose from his conducting the  'Craftsman'  in which he was made the tool of oppofition For some extraordinarily indiscreet use of his libelling powers the printers of this paper were seized and Mr Amhurst with a view of being considered as the victim of his party and more than indemnified for all he should suffer surrendered himself but the prosecution dropped and he was disappointed Upon the famous compromise of no terms were stipulated by his friends for him who had been the instrument of their success the reflection whereon is thought to have precipitated his end for he died in a few months after as is said of a broken heart and was indebted to the bounty of Franklin the printer for a grave  Samuel Boyse the son of an English dissenting minister was born in and educated at a private school in Dublin At eighteen he was sent to Glasgow and before he had completed his nineteenth year married the daughter of a tradesman there His father for a considerable time supported his natural extravagance which his wife who was dissolute and vicious rendered still more burthensome This resource failing he went to Edinburgh where his poetical abilities procured him many friends particularly the countess of Eglinton and lord Stormont who assisted him in his exigencies and were disposed to continue their bounty but Boyse's character and deportment repelled kindness His talents were great he had a genius for poetry for painting and music yet it was so obscured by a mean and sordid temper that many knew him intimately without discovering his abilities his chosen acquaintances were such as could not serve him he was intoxicated whenever he had the means to avoid starving and was voluptuous luxurious and boundlessly expensive without the least taste for what is elegant The contempt he drew on himself at Edinburgh made him resolve on quitting it for London whither those who had been his patrons gave him very valuable recommendatory letters but he slighted them and preferred subsisting by precarious donations In the year he was reduced to the want of necessary apparel and having pawned whatever he could exist without was confined by his indigence to a bed which had no sheets here to procure food he wrote his posture sitting up in bed his only covering a blanket in which a hole was made to admit of the employment of his arm  In while in a spunginghouse he was driven to solicit Cave for some temporary relief and to procure it wrote the following horrible description of the situation into which his neglect of oeconomy and his want of common prudence had plunged him  Inscription for St LAZARUS'S cave  Hodie teste coelo summo  Sine pane sine nummo  Sorte positus infeste  Scribo tibi dolens moeste  Fame bile tumet jecur  Urbane mitte opem precor  Tibi enim cor humanum  Non a malis alienum  Mihi mens

shocking for me to think of  I am with sincere regard Sir Your unfortunate humble servant S BOYSE  Crown coffeehouse Grocer's alley Poultry  July  Received from Mr Cave the sum of half a guinea by me in confinement S Boyse  The miseries of his confinement did not teach him discretion he was released but his wants were little abated and he made use of the most disgraceful arts to excite charity he sometimes raised subscriptions for nonexistent poems and sometimes employed his wife to give out that he was dying He was afterwards engaged at a very low rate in the compilation of an historical view of the transactions of Europe by Mr Henry of Reading at which place his wife died To signify his sorrow for her death he tied a black ribbon round the neck of a lapdog which to acquire the character of a man of taste he used to carry in his arms After he left Reading he grew more decent in his dress and behaviour but his health was then declining and in May he died in an obscure lodging near Shoelane and was buried at the charge of the parish  and many others  from which he inferred that slavery and indigence were its inseparable concomitants and reflecting on  the lives and conduct of these men might fear that it had a necessary tendency to corrupt the mind and  render the followers of it with respect to religion to politics and even to morality altogether indifferent Nor could he be ignorant of that mortifying dependence which the profession itself exposes men to a profession that leads to no preferment and for its  most laborious exertions confers no greater a reward than a supply of natural wants  Ralph a writer of this class and who had formed some such connections as would have flattered the hopes of any man was the tool of that party of which the late lord Melcombe laboured to be the head To serve the interests of it he wrote a periodical paper and a voluminous history of England fraught with such principles as he was required to disseminate This man in a pamphlet intitled  'The case of authors by profession'  has enumerated all the evils that attend it and shewn it to be the last that a liberal mind would choose  All this Johnson knew and had duly weighed the lesser evils of an author's profession such as a dependence on booksellers and a precarious income he was able to endure and the greater that is to say the prostitution of his talents he averted for whatever sacrifices of their principles such men as Waller Dryden and others have made in their writings or to whatever lengths they may have gone in panegyrics or adulatory addresses his integrity was not to be warped his religious and political opinions he retained and cherished and in a sullen confidence in the strength of his mental powers disdained to solicit patronage by any of the arts in common use with writers of almost every denomination That this firmness was not affected will appear by a retrospect to the methods he took for the attainment of knowledge and the settling his notions as to the great duties of life  His course of study at the university was irregular and desultory and scarcely determined as to its object  Mathematics and physics he had but little relish for from whence it may be inferred that his natural powers had received comparatively but small improvement from an academical education An habitual disposition to thought and reflection enabled him however upon his leaving it to attain to that degree of improvement which in many minds is not effected without intense application and labour and the sentiments of piety which he had imbibed in his youth directed him to those studies which without attending to secular rewards he thought of greatest importance to his future happiness In conformity to this motive he applied himself to the study of the Holy Scriptures and the evidences of religion to the writings of the fathers and of the Greek moralists to ecclesiastical and civil history and to classical literature and philology  The result of these his mental exercises was a thorough conviction of the truth of the Christian religion an adherence to the doctrine and discipline of our established church and to that form of civil government which we number among the blessings derived to us from the wisdom and bravery of our ancestors with this farther advantage that they rooted in his mind those principles of religion morality and I will add loyalty that influenced his conduct during the remainder of his life  To speak of the first his religion it had a tincture o enthusiasm arising as is conjectured from the fervou of his imagination and the perusal of St Augustin and other of the fathers and the writings of Kempi and the ascetics which prompted him to the employ ment of composing meditations and devotional exer  cises It farther produced in him an habitual reverence for the name of God which he was never known to utter but on proper occasions and with due respect and operated on those that were admitted to his conversation as a powerful restraint of all profane discourse and idle discussions of theological questions and lastly it inspired him with that charity meaning thereby a general concern for the welfare of all mankind without which we are told that all pretensions to religion are vain  To enable him at times to review his progress in life and to estimate his improvement in religion he in the year began to note down the transactions of each day recollecting as well as he was able those of his youth and interspersing such reflections and resolutions as under particular circumstances he was induced to make This register which he intitled  'Annales'  does not form an entire volume but is contained in a variety of little books folded and stitched together by himself and which were found mixed with his papers Some specimens of these notanda have been lately printed with his prayers but to warrant what I have said respecting his religious character I have selected from the  'Annales'  and insert in the margin below an earlier extract than any contained in that collection  'Friday August th' ' at night This day I have trifled away except that I have attended the school in the morning I read to night in Rogers's sermons To night I began the breakfast law anew  'Sept th I have this day entered upon my th year Mayest thou O God enable me for Jesus Christ's sake to spend this in such a manner that I may receive comfort from it at the hour of death and in the day of judgment Amen  'I intend tomorrow to review the rules I have at any time laid down in order to practise them'    His moral character displayed itself in the sincerity of his friendships his love of justice and of truth and his placability of all which qualities the testimonies in his favour are innumerable But as the character here proposed to be given him is not intended to palliate his errors in behaviour truth obliges me to say that his outward deportment was in many instances a just subject of censure Before his arrival in town he was but little accustomed to free conversation with his superiors so that that kind of submission he had been used to pay them he seemed to exact from others and when it was refused him he was petulant captious and dogged His discourse which through life was of the didactic kind was replete with original sentiments expressed in the strongest and most correct terms and in such language that whoever could have heard and not seen him would have thought him reading For the pleasure he communicated to his hearers he expected not the tribute of silence on the contrary he encouraged others particularly young men to speak and paid a due attention to what they said but his prejudices were so strong and deeply rooted more especially against Scotchmen and whigs that whoever thwarted him ran the risque of a severe rebuke or at best became entangled in an unpleasant altercation  He was scarce settled in town before this dogmatical behaviour and his impatience of contradiction became  a part of his character and deterred many persons of learning who wished to enjoy the delight of his conversation from seeking his acquaintance There were not wanting those among his friends who would sometimes hint to him that the conditions of free conversation imply an equality among those engaged in it which are violated whenever superiority is assumed their reproofs he took kindly and would in excuse for what they called the pride of learning say that it was of the defensive kind The repetition of these had however a great effect on him they abated his prejudices and produced a change in his temper and manners that rendered him at length a desirable companion in the most polite circles  In the lesser duties of morality he was remiss he slept when he should have studied and watched when he should have been at rest his habits were slovenly and the neglect of his person and garb so great as to render his appearance disgusting He was an ill husband of his time and so regardless of the hours of resection that at two he might be found at breakfast and at dinner at eight In his studies and I may add in his devotional exercises he was both intense and remiss and in the prosecution of his literary employments dilatory and hasty unwilling as himself confessed to work and working with vigour and haste  See his prayers page    His indolence or rather the delight he took in reading and reflection rendered him averse to bodily exertions He was ill made for riding and took so  little pleasure in it that as he once told me he has fallen asleep on his horse Walking he seldom practised perhaps for no better reason than that it required the previous labour of dressing In a word mental occupation was his sole pleasure and the knowledge he acquired in the pursuit of it he was ever ready to communicate in which faculty he was not only excellent but expert for as it is related of lord Bacon by one who knew him  Works of Francis Osborn  Esq  vo page  that  'in all companies he appeared a good proficient if not a master in those arts entertained for the subject of every one's discourse'  and that  'his most casual talk deserved to be written'  so it may be said of Johnson that his conversation was ever suited to the profession condition and capacity of those with whom he talked  Of a mind thus stored it is surely not too much to say that it qualified the possessor of it for many more important employments than the instruction of nonadults in the elements of literature yet so humbly did he seem to think of himself when he published the advertisement of his little academy at Edial that to be able to establish it was the utmost of his ambition but that hope failing his necessities drove him to London and placed him in the station of life in which we are now to contemplate him  It has been mentioned in a preceding page that in the course of his studies he had formed a list of literary undertakings on which when time should serve or occasion invite he meant to exercise his pen but such was the versatility of his temper that of fortynine articles which he had fixed  on not one appears to have engaged his future attention Among the rest he had purposed to give a history of the revival of learning in Europe and also a comparison of philosophical and christian morality by sentences collected from the moralists and fathers  Vide supra page in not  The former of these as it required the labour of deep research and the perusal of a great variety of authors was a work that we may suppose he was deterred from by frequent reflections on the pains it would cost him but that he should abandon a work so easy in the execution and so much to the credit of the religion he professed as the latter is not less to be wondered at than lamented  These projects of Johnson were most of them resolved on in his earlier days but it is not improbable that he was induced to give them up by the prospect of the gain that might arise from the publication of a new edition of Shakespeare which it is certain he meditated about the year To an undertaking of this kind the temptations were very strong for besides that the former editors had fallen short in their endeavours to explain and settle the text he had great reason to hope it would be well received for at that time it was observable that the taste of the public was refining and that the lovers of stage entertainments and dramatic literature had begun to nauseate the tragedies and comedies of the last age which were formed after French models and to discern the beauties and excellencies of this author  That this hope was not illgrounded may reasonably be inferred from the success of those many editions of this author that have appeared since the above time of one whereof above eleven thousand copies have been sold and next from the effects of Mr Garrick's acting which had revived the exhibition of Shakespeare's plays and excited readers of every class to the perusal of them  But perhaps the greatest of Johnson's temptations to this undertaking saving at all times his necessities was a desire to display his skill in English literature and rational criticism in their widest extent in both which requisites the deficiences of the former editions were obvious Of those of the players and others down to the year little in favour can be said the first that made any pretensions to correctness was that of Rowe in and next to that Mr Pope's in to Whatever other were the merits of these two persons it is certain that neither of them was sufficiently qualified for the task he had undertaken not that they wanted the power of discerning the excellences of their author or clearing his page of many corruptions that had long obscured his sense but that they were deficient in that lower kind of literature without which all endeavours to fix or explain the text of an old writer will ever be found to be vain  To this kind of knowledge as far as may be judged from the course of his studies and indeed from the preface to his edition Rowe had not the least pretension Nor does it appear that Pope was at all conversant with or that he understood the phraseology  of the writers contemporary with his author So little was he used to that kind of reading that as himself confessed he had never heard of the Virgidemiarum of bishop Hall a collection of the wittiest and most pointed satires in our language till it was shewn to him and that so late in his life that he could only express his approbation of it by a wish that he had seen it sooner That vernacular erudition contemptible as it has been represented is an indispensable qualification for the restoring or explaining the sense of corrupted or obsolete authors and even of those more recent is most clearly evidenced in one case by the later editions of our great dramatic poet and in the other by Dr Grey's edition of Hudibras without the assistance whereof the many allusions to facts circumstances and situations therein contained must for ever have remained unintelligible Theobald was the first of this class of editors For the purpose of publishing Shakespeare he in the preface to his first edition asserts that he had read no fewer than eight hundred old English plays besides histories and novels to a great amount and the same kind of study has with different degrees of assiduity been pursued by others even to the last of his successors  With these inducements and the aid of two valuable editions then extant Theobald's and that of Sir Thomas Hanmer Johnson projected a new one and as a specimen of his abilities for the undertaking published in the year  'Miscellaneous observations on the tragedy of Macbeth with remarks on Sir Thomas Hanmer's edition of Shakespeare'  with proposals for one by himself These observations as  they go rather to adjust the various readings and settle the text by conjectural notes than explain allusions did not enough attract the notice of the public to induce him actually to engage in the work they were however evidences of great sagacity and drew from Dr Warburton a testimony that set him above all other competitors for thus does he speak of Johnson  'As to all those things which have been published under the tirles of Essays Remarks Observations c on Shakespeare if you except some critical notes on Macbeth given as a specimen of a projected edition and written as appears by a man of parts and genius the rest are absolutely below a serious notice'  and Johnson who never forgot a kindness remembered it by mentioning Warburton in terms of great respect as occasion offered in his edition of Shakespeare which he published many years after  By this and other of Johnson's writings his reputation as a scholar and a philogist was so well established that the booksellers of greatest opulence in the city who had long meditated the publication of a dictionary after the model of those of France and the Academia della Crusca looked upon him as a fit person to be employed in such an undertaking He was at that time in the vigour of his life and by the offer of a liberal reward from men of such known worth as those were who made it was tempted to engage with them and accordingly set himself to compile that work which he living to complete it does him and all concerned in it great honour  Nor can we suppose but that he was in a great measure incited to the prosecution of this laborious work  by a reflection on the state of our language at this time from the imperfection of all English dictionaries then extant and the great distance in point of improvement in this kind of literature between us and some of our neighbours And here let me take occasion by an enumeration of the several authors that had gone before him to point out the sources of that intelligence which Johnson's voluminous work contains  Of Latin dictionaries and such as give the significations of English appellatives with a view only to illustrate the Latin he must be supposed to have made some use and of these the earliest is Sir Thomas Elyot's Bibliotheca Eliotae published in This was improved by Cooper after many years' labor by the addition of words and published in in a large folio and was a reason with Queen Elizabeth for promoting him to the bishopric of Lincoln  The following fact respecting this work remains upon record viz that his wife burnt the notes that he had been eight years gathering and that he was other eight years in gathering the same notes wherewith he composed his dictionary Her pretence was fear that he should kill himself with study but she was a shrew and infamous for lewdness  In was published an Alvearie or quadruple dictionary of four sundry tongues namely English Latin Greek and French by John Baret of Cambridge complied with the assistance of his pupils but arranged and methodized by himself This fact he ingenuously  confessed in his preface which as a literary curiosity is inserted below  'About eighteene yeeres agone hauing pupils at Cambridge studious of the Latine tongue I vsed them often to write epistles and theames together and dailie to translate some peece of English into Latine for the more speedie and easie attaining of the same And after we had a little begun perceiuing what great trouble it was to come running to me for euerie worde they missed knowing then of no other dictionarie to helpe vs but Sir  Thomas Elict  's librarie which was come out a little before I appointed them certaine leaues of the same booke euerie daie to write the English before the Latin and likewise to gather a number of fine phrases out of  Cicero Terence Coesar Liuie  c to set them vnder severall titles for the more readie finding them againe at their neede Thus within a yeere or two they had gathered together a great volume which for the apt similitude betweene the good scholers and diligent bees in gathering their waxe and honie into their hive I called then their  Aluearie  both for a memoriall by whom it was made and also by this name to incourage other to the like diligence for that they should not see their worthie

waies moued me to put it in print for the common profit of others and the publike propagation of the Latine tongue or els to suffer them to get it printed at their proper costes and charges But I both vnwilling and halfe ashamed to haue our rude notes come abroad vnder the view of so manie learned eies especiallie finding no leasure from my prefixed studies for the polishing of the same vtterlie denied their request vntil at length comming to London the right worshipfull maister  Powle  maister  Garth  with other singular sauourers of all good learning and my verie especiall friends with their importunate and earnest exhortations had cleane ouercome my contrarie mind Then immediatelie laieng aside all other studies I was faine to seeke for writers and workemen about the same to make it readie for the presse Therefore I went to diuers of mine old pupils then being at the Innes of Court delivering ech of them some part of their old discontinued worke to see it written faire againe and for other peeces which I thought vnperfect I gat certaine of the best scholers of two or three scholes in London to write after my prescription but in the French tables although I had before trauelled in diuers countries beyond the seas both for language and learning yet not trusting to mine owne skill I vsed the helpe of M  Chaloner  and M  Claudius  Upon this occasion I being much conuersant about the Innes of Court and also some time occupied among scholers in the scholes there came vnto me a printer shewing me  Huloets  dictionarie which before I neuer sawe and told me he intended to print it out of hand augmented with our notes also if I would But this bargaine went not forward with him for diuers causes which here it were to long to reherse And surelie had not the right honourable Sir  Thomas Smith  knight principall secretarie to the Queenes Maiestie that noble  Theseus  of learning and comfortable patrone to all students and the right worshipfull M  Nowell  deane of Pawles manie waies encouraged me in this wearie worke the charges were so great and the losse of my time so much grieued me I had never bene able alone to haue wrestled against so manie troubles but long ere this had cleane broken off our worke begun and cast it by for euer  'Now therefore gentle reader looke not to finde in this booke euerie thing whatsoeuer thou wouldest seeke for as though all things were here so perfect that nothing lacked or were possible to be added hereunto But if thou maiest onelie find here the most wordes that thou needest or at the least so manie as no other dictionarie yet extant or made hath the like take then I saie in good part this our simple  Aluearie  in the meane time and geue God the praise that first moued me to set my pupils on worke thereabout and so mercifullie also hath strengthened vs thus as it is at length to atchieue and finish the same'  To Baret's succeeded John Minsheu's Guide into the tongues first published in in eleven and in in nine languages but with a considerable increase in the number of radical words In this the author undertakes to give the etymologies or derivations of the greater part of the words therein contained but as they amount at the most to no more than the work must be deemed not sufficiently copious  In Thomas Blount a lawyer of the Inner Temple published a small volume intitled  'Glossographia  or a dictionary interpreting such hard words whether Hebrew Greek Latin Italian c that are now used in our refined English tongue c'  in which the articles though few are well explained This book as far as it went was of singular use to Edward Philips a nephew and pupil of Milton in the compilation of a dictionary by him published in folio intitled  'The New World of Words'  which as it is much more copious than that of Blount and comprehends a great quantity of matter must be looked on as the basis of English lexicography  Of technical as also of etymological dictionaries many have long been extant namely The Interpreter  or Law Dictionary of Dr Cowell a civilian a CommonLaw Dictionary of the above Thomas Blount the Etymologicum of Junius and another of Skinner both well known and frequently referred to and of these did Johnson avail himself  The dictionary of Nathan Bailey a schoolmaster was first published in a thick octavo volume so well disposed with respect to the character and method of printing as to contain more matter than could otherwise have been comprized in a volume of that size After it had passed many editions with improvements by the author himself he meditated an enlargement of it and being assisted in the  mathematical part by Mr Gordon in the botanical by the famous gardener Philip Miller and in the etymological by Mr Lediard a professor of the modern languages it was published in a folio size The last improvement of it was by Dr Joseph Nicoll Scott who of a dissenting teacher had become a physician and a writer for the booksellers  Johnson who before this time together with his wife had lived in obscurity lodging at different houses in the courts and alleys in and about the Strand and Fleet street had for the purpose of carrying on this arduous work and being near the printers employed in it taken a handsome house in Gough square and fitted up a room in it with desks and other accommodations for amanuenses who to the number of five or six he kept constantly under his eye An interleaved copy of Bailey's dictionary in folio he made the repository of the several articles and these he collected by incessant reading the best authors in our language in the practice whereof his method was to score with a blacklead pencil the words by him selected and give them over to his assistants to insert in their places The books he used for this purpose were what he had in his own collection a copious but a miserably ragged one and all such as he could borrow which latter if ever they came back to those that lent them were so defaced as to be scarce worth owning and yet some of his friends were glad to receive and entertain them as curiosities  It seems that Johnson had made a considerable progress in his work when he was informed that the earl of Chesterfield had heard and spoken favourably of his design He had never till this time experienced  the patronage of any other than booksellers and though he had but an indistinct idea of that of a nobleman a reputed wit and an accomplished courtier and doubted whether he was to rate it among the happy incidents of his life it might mean a liberal present or an handsome pension to encourage him in the prosecution of the work he therefore resolved not to reject it by a supercilious comparison of his own talents with those of his lordship or to slight a favour which he was not able to estimate Accordingly he in the year drew up and dedicated to lord Chesterfield then a secretary of state a plan of his dictionary the manuscript whereof he delivered to Mr Whitehead the late laureat who undertook to convey it to his lordship but he having communicated it first to another person it passed through other hands before it reached that to which it was immediately directed the result was an invitation from lord Chesterfield to the author  Never could there be a stronger contrast of characters than this interview produced a scholar and a courtier the one ignorant of the forms and modes of address the other to an affected degree accomplished in both the one in a manly and sententious stile directing his discourse to a weighty subject the other dreading to incur the imputation of pedantry and by the interposition of compliments and the introduction of new topics as artfully endeavouring to evade it The acquaintance thus commenced was never improved into friendship What his lordship thought of Johnson we may learn from his letters to an illegitimate son now extant  Letter  Johnson was so little pleased  with his once supposed patron that he forbore not ever after to speak of him in terms of the greatest contempt  How far Johnson was right in his opinion of this popular nobleman or whether he is to be suspected of having resented more than he ought to have done the coldness of his reception or the disappointment of his hopes will best appear by a survey of his character as it arises out of the memoirs of his life prefixed to his miscellaneous works and the sentiments and principles which for the instruction of his son he in a course of letters to him from time to time communicated and with the utmost solicitude laboured to inculcate and enforce  His lordship's descent was from an illustrious though not a very ancient family Being as himself relates rather neglected by his father and in his tender years bereft of his mother the care of his education devolved on his grandmother the marchioness of Halifax a woman of exemplary virtue and discretion who fearing perhaps the contagion of a public seminary kept him in her family and with the best assistance of instructors that she could procure conferred on him all the benefits that could be hoped for in a course of domestic education  At the age of eighteen he was sent to Trinity hall Cambridge where as he informs us he had a great deal of business on his hands for he spent above an hour every day in studying the civil law and as much in philosophy and attended the mathematical lectures of the blind man professor Saunderson so that adds he I am now fully employed But notwithstanding  this intense application to his studies this hopeful young nobleman seems to have brought from the university less of what all such seminaries profess to teach sound learning and good morals than a hatred of that pedantry and illiberality of manners which throughout his writings he reprobates as the inseparable concomitant of all academical institutions  As I have not taken upon me the office of his lordship's biographer I shall content myself with mentioning only those circumstances of his life and conduct that may serve to display his genuine character and enable the world to determine whether it was such a one as a wise man would chuse as a model for imitation or the standard by which he would form his own  After about two years stay at the university lord Stanhope for that was then his only title went abroad to travel and at that enchanting place the Hague began to be acquainted with the world The college rust which if we may believe his panegyrist he contracted in the university during so long a residence there he found means to rub off and exchanged for the polish of gaming which rendered him the dupe of knaves and sharpers almost throughout his life and this not from any real propensity to this pernicious vice arising either from avarice or the exercise of those mental powers that make it a delight to many but to acquire what throughout his life he seems to have above all things been desirous of the insipid character of a man of fashion  Nature it must be owned had endowed him with fine parts and these he cultivated with all the industry usually practised by such as prefer the semblance of  what is really fit just lovely honourable to the qualities themselves thus he had eloquence without learning complaisance without friendship and gallantry without love  Not much to his honour he in the year suffered himself to be chosen for a Cornish borough and took his seat in the house of commons at an age when it was in the power of any single member by the speaking of a very few words to have turned him out of it Upon a hint of his incapacity occasioned by a pert speech of his making he had the prudence to quit the house and retire to Paris glad of an opportunity of finishing his noviciate in a city that abounded with those pleasures and amusements that best suit with a mind to which study and the rational exercise of its faculties are labour  Upon the death of his father in he succeeded to his title and his seat in the house of peers His speeches in that assembly which were though flimsy florid gave him as that species of eloquence will ever do the reputation of a fine orator and in this he was so confident that he has not scrupled to confess that he has spoken with great applause as on the bill for reforming the calendar on subjects that he understood not  'For my own part' says he 'I could just as soon have talked Celtic or Sclavonian to them the lords as astronomy and they would have understood me full as well so I resolved to do better than speak to the purpose and to please instead of informing them'  and for this he gives as a reason what perhaps will be found to be a true one that every numerous  Letters to his son number  merous assembly is a mob and to such a one reason and good sense are never to be talked  In addition to his character of an orator and a statesman he was emulous of that of a poet his pretensions to which were founded on sundry little compositions in verse that from time to time appeared in collections of that kind elegant it must be confessed but generally immoral and oft times profane  His dissimulation deep and refined as it was did not lead him to profess any sincere regard to virtue or religion the grosser immoralities he affects to speak of with abhorrence but such as might be practised without the loss of health and reputation he seemed to think there was no law against He was therefore if secret vain in his amours and though setting aside his mien his person had little to recommend it for he was low of stature had coarse features and a cadaverous complexion  He was also longvisaged and longnecked but from the shoulders to the waist very short which a wit once observing said he was a giant cut down alluding to the practice of cutting down ships of war to render them more active  his confidence in the prosecution of them was such as exposed him to greater risques of personal safety than most men would chuse to run and of this I shall now produce an instance  A lady of high quality and a relation of one who had the story from her own mouth and told it me having been married some few years but never having brought her lord a child was surprised one morning by a visit from lord Chesterfield whom she had frequently seen and conversed with at court After the usual compliments  had passed his lordship in that easy gay style which he so strongly recommends to his son gave her to understand that he should be happy to form such a connection with her ladyship as it was more than probable might give being to an heir to the honours and possessions of that noble family into which she had matched I will not attempt to describe the indignation which the lady felt at such an unexampled instance of impudence as the proposal indicated She rose from her chair and with all the dignity of insulted modesty commanded this wellbred lover this minion of the graces to quit her house with this menace  'Think yourself well off my lord that for this affront I do not order my servants to push you headlong out of doors'  It is a refinement in modern gallantry but an affront to human policy to recognize in public by the unqualified appellation of son those to whom the laws of most civilized countries deny not only that but the privilege of heirs yet this has this slave to forms and usages done in a series of letters to a young gentleman begotten by him out of wedlock and in the lifetime of one to whom we must suppose he once tendered himself his honours his possessions and his heart With a solicitude for his welfare commendable it must be said in its general intention he takes on himself to mold his person to form his manners and to furnish his mind In the first of these particulars his lordship had great difficulties to encounter the clay he had chosen to work upon was stiff and resisted the plastic touch the boy was encumbered with flesh and nature had so carelessly compacted his limbs as scarcely  to leave them the power of flexure In a word in infancy he was shapeless and in youth a looby Never did a shebear with more anxious assiduity labour to lick her cub into shape than this fond parent did to correct the errors of nature in the formation of this his darling the head the shoulders and the hands were by turns the objects of his care but the legs and feet seem to have engaged most of his attention these upon his being sent abroad were committed to the care of a dancingmaster at Paris whose instructions he estimates at a higher rate than the precepts of Aristotle  Letter  He recommends to form his manners les agrémens et les graces  Letter  les manieres la tournure et les usages du beau monde  Letter  and is perpetually reminding him of that trite maxim  'Suaviter in modo fortiter in re'  Letter  The best furniture of a young man's mind are the precepts of religion and sound morality Not a word of either of these do we meet with in two quarto volumes of those letters which I am now citing but in them precepts of a different kind such as respect his pleasures abound Assuming an air of sapience which was not very natural to his lordship he remarks that in the course of the world the qualifications of the cameleon are often necessary nay they must be carried a little farther and exerted a little sooner  'for you should' adds he 'to a certain degree take the hue of either the man or woman that you want and wish to be upon terms with'  Fatherly curiosity then prompts him to an enquiry into certain particulars which these his own words will go near to explain  'Apropos have you yet found out at Paris any friendly and hospitable Madame de Lursay qui veut bien se charger du soin de vous éduquer And have you had any occasion of representing to her qu'elle faisoit donc des noeuds But I ask your pardon Sir for the abruptness of the question and acknowledge that I am meddling with matters that are out of my department However in matters of less importance I desire to be de vos secrets le fidele dépositaire Trust me with the general turn and colour of your amusements at Paris Is it le fracas du grand monde comédies bals opéras cour c Or is it des petites societés moins bruiantes mais pas pour cela moins agréables Where are you the most établi Where are you le petit Stanhope Voyez vous encore jour à quelque arrangement honnête'  Letter  Farther to initiate him into vice he recommends to him the  'turning over men by day and women by night'  for thus it pleases him to render the precept Nocturna versate manu versate diurna  Letter  and with matchless effrontery and total disregard for the personal safety of him whom he is instructing advises him in effect to risque being run through the body or the breaking his neck out of a bedchamber window by commencing an intrigue with a newmarried and virtuous young lady Hear the documents of our Metnor to this purpose  'Go' says he 'among women with the good qualities of your sex and you will acquire from them the softness and the graces of theirs Men will then add affection to the esteem  which they before had for youWomen are the only refiners of the merit of men it is true they cannot add weight but they polish and give lustre to it Apropos I am assured that Madame de Blot although she has no great regularity of features is notwithstanding excessively pretty and that for all that she has as yet been scrupulously constant to her husband though she has now been married above a year Surely she does not reflect that woman wants polishing I would have you polish one another reciprocally Assiduities attentions tender looks and passionate declarations on your side will produce some irresolute wishes at least on hers and when even the slightest wishes arise the rest will soon follow  Letter  '  Finally to attain these and the other ends which his lordship points out as the objects of his son's pursuit he inculcates in the strongest terms the practice of those arts of crooked cunning which as lord Bacon has remarked oftner defeat than effect their purpose and together with these the general exercise of that dissimulation which was one of the most prominent features in his own character  The letters from lord Chesterfield to his son are two hundred and eightyfive in number The precepts contained in them are multifarious and it is to be feared that they have not only been adopted by many ignorant parents and indiscreet tutors but that they have greatly tended to corrupt the morals of the rising generation As an antidote to the poison which they must be supposed to have diffused I shall  here insert a letter of moral instruction from one of the wisest and greatest men that this nation ever had to boast of to his son and leave the reader to make the comparison between it and those of the nobleman of whom I am now speaking It is from Sir Henry Sydney to his son Philip afterwards the famous Sir Philip who when arrived at the age of manhood combining the qualities of a soldier a scholar a poet and a courtier was confessedly one of the most accomplished gentlemen in Europe  I have received two letters from you one written in Latin the other in French which I take in good part and will you to exercise that practice of learning often for that will stand you in most stead in that profession of life that you are born to live in And since this is my first letter that ever I did write to you I will not that it be all empty of some advices which my natural care of you provoketh me to wish you to follow as documents to you in this your tender age Let your first action be the lifting up of your mind to Almighty God by hearty prayer and feelingly digest the words you speak in prayer with continual meditation and thinking of him to whom you pray and of the matter for which you pray and use this as an ordinary at and at an ordinary hour whereby the time itself will put you in remembrance to do that which you are accustomed to do In that time apply your study to such hours as your discreet master doth assign you earnestly and the time I know he will so limit as shall be both sufficient for your learning and safe for your health and mark the sense and  the matter of that you read as well as the words so shall you both enrich your tongue with words and your wit with matter and judgment will grow as years grow in you Be humble and obedient to your master for unless you frame yourself to obey others yea and feel in yourself what obedience is you shall never be able to teach others how to obey you Be courteous of gesture and affable to all men with diversity of reverence according to the dignity of the person there is nothing that winneth so much with so little cost Use moderate diet so as after your meat you may find your wit fresher and not duller and your body more lively and not more heavy Seldom drink wine and yet sometime do lest being inforced to drink upon the sudden you should find yourself inflamed Use exercise of body but such as is without peril of your joints or bones it will increase your force and enlarge your breath Delight to be cleanly as well in all parts of your body as in your garments it shall make you grateful in each company and otherwise loathsome Give yourself to be merry for you degenerate from your father if you find not yourself most able in wit and body to do any thing when you be most merry but let your mirth be ever void of all scurrility and biting words to any man for a wound given by a word is oftentimes harder to be cured than that which is given with the sword Be you rather a hearer and bearer away of other mens' talk than a beginner or procurer of speech otherwise you shall be counted to delight to hear yourself speak If you hear a wise sentence or an apt phrase  commit it to your memory with respect of the circumstances when you shall speak it Let never oath be heard to come out of your mouth nor word of ribaldry detest it in others so shall custom make to yourself a law against it in yourself Be modest in each assembly and rather be rebuked of light fellows for maidenlike shamefacedness than of your sad friends for pert boldness Think upon every word that you will speak before you utter it and remember how nature hath rampired up as it were the tongue with teeth lips yea and hair without the lips and all betokening reins or bridles for the loose use of that member Above all things tell no untruth no not in trifles The custom of it is naught and let it not satisfy you that for a time the hearers take it for a truth for after it will be known as it is to your shame for there cannot be a greater reproach to a gentleman than to be accounted a liar Study and endeavour yourself to be virtuously occupied so shall you make such an habit of welldoing in you that you shall not know how to do evil though you would Remember my son the noble blood you are descended of by your mother's side and think that only by virtuous life and good action you may be an ornament to that illustrious family and otherwise through vice and sloth you shall be counted labes generis one of the greatest curses that can happen to manWell my little Philip this is enough for me and too much I fear for you but if I shall find that this light meal of digestion nourish any thing the weak stomach of your young capacity I will  as I find the same grow stronger feed it with tougher food  Your loving father so long as you live in the fear of God H SYDNEY  Sydney papers vol page  The hopeful documents contained in this institute of politeness lord Chesterfield's letters to his son failed in a great measure of their end His lordship's interest with the ministry founded on a seat in parliament which though a great declaimer against corruption he bought as he would have done a horse procured him the appointment of an envoyextraordinary to the court of Dresden We find not that the young man had any female attachments but that on the contrary he had more grace than his father He married a woman who becoming a widow and provoked by real or imaginary ill treatment of lord Chesterfield published those letters which had he been living he would have given almost any thing to have suppressed as they shew him to have been a man devoted to pleasure and actuated by vanity without religious moral or political principles a smatterer in learning and in manners a coxcomb  Such was the person whom Johnson in the simplicity of his heart chose for a patron and was betrayed to celebrate as the Mecaenas of the age and such was the opinion he had conceived of his skill in literature his love of eloquence and his zeal for the interests of learning that he approached him with the utmost respect and that he might not err in his manner of expressing  it the stile and language of that address which his plan includes are little less than adulatory With a view farther to secure his patronage he waited on him in person and was honoured by him with conversations on the subject of literature in which he found him so deficient as gave him occasion to repent the choice he had made and to say that the labour he had bestowed in his address to lord Chesterfield resembled that of gilding a rotten post that he was a wit among lords and a lord among wits and that his accomplishments were only those of a dancingmaster  It is pretty well understood that as Johnson had chosen this nobleman for his patron he meant to have dedicated to him his work and he might possibly have done so even after he had discovered that he was unworthy of that honour but the earl's behaviour in a particular instance prevented him Johnson one day made him a morning visit and being admitted into an antichamber was told that his lordship was engaged with a gentleman but would see him as soon as the gentleman went It was not till after an hour's waiting that Johnson discovered that this gentleman was Colley Cibber which he had no sooner done than he rushed out of the house with a resolution never to enter it more  What impression Johnson's visits made upon his lordship we are told by the latter in a character of him which as well for the sake of the one as the other I wish to be held forth to the public Speaking as his lordship is ever doing to his son of the engaging manners the pleasing attentions the graces with the rest of that nonsense which was ever floating in his  mind he thus delineates the person who in language the most nervous and elegant had endeavoured to render him respectable in the republic of letters and in that particular to do for him what he was never able to do for himself  'There is a man whose moral character deep learning and superior parts I acknowledge admire and respect but whom it is so impossible for me to love that I am almost in a fever whenever I am in his company His figure without being deformed seems made to disgrace or ridicule the common structure of the human body His legs and arms are never in the position which according to the situation of his body they ought to be in but constantly employed in committing acts of hostility upon the graces He throws any where but down his throat whatever he means to drink and only mangles what he means to carve Inattentive to all the regards of social life he mistimes and misplaces every thing He disputes with heat and indiscriminately mindless of the rank character and situation of them with whom he disputes absolutely ignorant of the several gradations of familiarity and respect he is exactly the same to his superiors his equals and his inferiors and therefore by a necessary consequence absurd to two of the three Is it possible to love such a man No The utmost I can do for him is to consider him as a respectable Hottentor  Letter  '  Had Socrates been living and not learned as we are told he did in his old age to dance lord Chesterfield had passed the same censure on him  Johnson was by this time able to determine on a fact which in his address to this nobleman he expresses  a doubt of viz whether the unexpected distinction his lordship had shewn him was to be rated among the happy incidents of his life he was now convinced that it was not and that far from every thing like encouragement or assistance or what else is included in the idea of patronage his lordship's approbation of his plan was to be the only recompence for the labour of drawing it out and reducing it to form Besides declaring whenever occasion required it his mistake in supposing that lord Chesterfield was either a judge of or a friend to literature he expressed in a letter to his lordship himself his resentment of the affront he had received at his last visit and concluded it with a formal renunciation for ever of his lordship's patronage  If Johnson had reflected a moment on the little effect likely to be produced by a letter in which he professed to reject that which he could not retain he would never have wrote it Those evils which cannot be remedied must be borne with patience and to resent injuries when we cannot enforce redress is to give our adversaries an occasion of triumph lord Chesterfield knew this and made no reply when the dictionary was completed and about to be published he wrote two essays in a periodical paper intitled  'The World'  that contain some forced compliments of the author which being mentioned to Johnson he rejected with scorn  Further to appease him his lordship sent two persons the one a specious but empty man Sir Thomas Robinson more distinguished by the tallness of his  person than for any estimable qualities  This person who is now at rest in Westminsterabbey was when living distinguished by the name of long Sir Thomas Robinson He was a man of the world or rather of the town and a great pest to persons of high rank or in office He was very troublesome to the late duke of Newcastle and when in his visits to him he was told that his Grace was gone out would desire to be admitted to look at the clock or to play with a monkey that was kept in the hall in hopes of being sent for in to the duke This he had so frequently done that all in the house were tired of him At length it was concerted among the servants that he should receive a summary answer to his usual questions and accordingly at his next coming the porter as soon as he had opened the gate and without waiting for what he had to say dismissed him with these words  'Sir his Grace is gone out the clock stands and the monkey is dead'  the other an eminent painter now living These were instructed to apologize for his lordship's treatment of him and to make him tenders of his future friendship and patronage Sir Thomas whose talent was flattery was profuse in his commendations of Johnson and his writings and declared that were his circumstances other than they were himself would settle five hundred pounds a year on him  'And who are you' asked Johnson 'that talk thus liberally' 'I am' said the other 'Sir Thomas Robinson a Yorkshire baronet' 'Sir' replied Johnson 'if the first peer of the realm were to make me such an offer I would shew him the way down stairs'  No one will commend this manner of declining an intentional kindness even where the sincerity of the intention might be doubtful but the rejecting it with a menace was both unnecessary and insolent The pride of independence  was most strong in Johnson at those periods of his life when his wants were greatest and though at other times he would subject himself to great obligations he was uniform except only in one instance in an opinion that an offer of pecuniary assistance was an insult and not seldom rejected it with such indignation that were I to characterise it more particularly I should do it by an allusion to the following apologue A gardener's dog had fallen into a well and was unable to get out his master passing by and seeing his distress put down his arm to save him the dog bit his hand and the gardener left him to drown  The uneasiness which Johnson felt at the time when he wrote the abovementioned letter gave way to a call of his friend Garrick who in the same year was by a series of occurrences become master of Drurylane theatre I was never much conversant with the history of the stage and therefore can give but a slight account of an event which at that time interested many and was deemed a very important one Mr Fleetwood's extravagance had reduced him to the necessity of seeking out for some one or more persons to whom for an adequate consideration he might relinquish his interest in the patent At that time a man of the name of Lacy had attracted the notice of the town by a competition with orator Henley which he began at the great room in York buildings with a satirical discourse of great licence which he advertised by the name of Peter's visitation The liberties he had taken with the clergy and the principal officers of state in this ludicrous discourse gave great  offence he was seized dealt with as a vagrant and in short silenced This man had lived among players and was supposed to understand stagemanagement and had some friends Mr Garrick had many and those opulent men three of them Mr Draper the partner of Mr Tonson the bookseller Mr Clutterbuck a mercer and Mr Samuel Sharpe one of the surgeons of Guy's hospital negociated a partnership between those two persons and by purchasing of them and assisting them to dispose of what are called renters' shares enabled them to buy out Fleetwood and before the commencement of the acting season they were become jointpatentees of the theatre abovementioned  Mr Garrick's province in the management was to appoint the plays and to cast the parts Lacy's was to superintend the workmen and servants to order the scenery and with the assistance of artists to adjust the ornaments and decorations It was their resolution to banish from their stage pantomimes and all grotesque representations and to exhibit such only as a rational and judicious audience might be supposed inclined to approve  To notify this their intention to the town it seemed to them that a prologue was necessary Johnson was easily prevailed upon by Mr Garrick to write one and at the opening of the theatre in it was spoken by the latter in a manner that did equal honour to the author and himself  Prologues are addresses from the stage to the people and either respect merely the drama that is to follow or are of more general import setting forth to the audience the views and designs of managers  their anxiety to please and the methods by which they hope to obtain the favour of the public these latter are for the most part occasional and adapted to such circumstances as the opening a new theatre a change of management or any other of those great theatrical revolutions in which the players affect to think all men as much interested as themselves In the addresses of this kind the powers of wit seem to have been nearly exhausted sometimes the audience has been cajoled at others betrayed into good humour and by the help of allegory the stage has been made to resemble every thing unlike it One poet feigns that the town is a sea the playhouse a ship the manager the captain the players sailors and the orangegirls powdermonkies and Mr Garrick in one of his prologues would make his audience believe that his theatre is a tavern himself the master the players waiters and his entertainment wines suited to all palates one of his liquors in particular he strongly recommends and calls Shakespeare which that he may be constantly able to supply he says it is  his wish his plan  To lose no drop of that immortal man  Prologue to the Winter's Tale and Catherine and Petruchio  And to be more particular that  to delight ye  Bardolph is gin and Pistol aquavitae  Ibid  Johnson's prologue is of a very different cast It is a sober rational and manly appeal to the good  sense and candour of the audience and contains a brief history of theatric representations from the time of Shakespeare and Jonson to their decline when as he says the writers of pantomime and song had confirmed the sway of folly It states the hardships which those lye under whose business it is to furnish entertainment for the public in being obliged to watch the wild vicissitudes of taste and exhorts the hearers to patronize virtue and reviving sense  To justify the above character of this nervous composition I here insert it  When Learning's triumph o'er her barb'rous foes  First rear'd the stage immortal Shakespeare rose  Each change of manycolour'd life he drew  Exhausted worlds and then imagin'd new  Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign  And panting Time toil'd after him in vain  His powerful strokes presiding Truth impress'd  And unresisted Passion storm'd the breast  Then Jonson came instructed from the school  To please in method and invent by rule  His studious patience and laborious art  By regular approach essay'd the heart  Cold approbation gave the lingering bays  For those who durst not censure scarce could praise  A mortal born he met the general doom  But left like Egypt's kings a lasting tomb  The wits of Charles found easier ways to fame  Nor wish'd for Jonson's art or Shakespeare's flame  Themselves they studied as they felt they writ  Intrigue was plot obscenity was wit  Vice always found a sympathetic friend  They pleas'd their age and did not aim to mend  Yet bards like these aspir'd to lasting praise  And proudly hop'd to pimp in future days  Their cause was general their supports were strong  Their slaves were willing and their reign was long  Till Shame regain'd the post that Sense betray'd  And Virtue call'd Oblivion to her aid  Then crush'd by rules and weaken'd as refin'd  For years the pow'r of tragedy declin'd  From bard to bard the frigid caution crept  Till declamation roar'd whilst passion slept  Yet still did Virtue deign the stage to tread  Philosophy remain'd though Nature fled  But forc'd at length her ancient reign to quit  She saw great Faustus lay the ghost of wit  Exulting Folly hail'd the joyous day  And Pantomime and Song confirm'd her sway  But who the coming changes can presage  And mark the future periods of the stage  Perhaps if skill could distant times explore  New Behns new Durfeys yet remain in store  Perhaps where Lear has rav'd and Hamlet dy'd  On flying cars new sorcerers may ride  Perhaps for who can guess the effects of chance  Here Hunt may box or Mahomet  A ropedancer a real or pretended Turk that exhibited on Coventgarden stage a winter or two before  may dance  Hard is his lot that here by fortune plac'd  Must watch the wild vicissitudes of Taste  With every meteor of Caprice must play  And chace the newblown bubbles of the day  Ah let not censure term our fate our choice  The stage but echoes back the public voice  The drama's laws the drama's patrons give  For we that live to please must please to live  Then prompt no more the follies you decry  As tyrants doom their tools of guilt to die  'Tis your's this night to bid the reign commence  Of rescu'd Nature and reviving Sense  To chace the charms of sound the pomp of show  For useful mirth and salutary woe  Bid scenic Virtue form the rising age  And Truth diffuse her radiance from the stage  This masterly and spirited address failed in a great measure of its effect the town it is true submitted to the revival of Shakespeare's plays recommended as they were by the exquisite acting of Mr Garrick but in a few winters they discovered an impatience for pantomimes and balladfarces and were indulged with them From that time Mr Garrick gave up the hope of correcting the public taste and at length became so indifferent about it that he once told me that if the town required him to exhibit the  'Pilgrim's Progress'  in a drama he would do it  Two years after the management of Drurylane theatre being in the hands of his friends Johnson bethought himself of bringing his tragedy on the stage It was not only a juvenile composition but was written before he had become conversant with Shakespeare indeed before he had ever read Othello and having now for more than ten years lain by him in which time his judgment had been growing to maturity he  set himself to revise and polish it taking to his assistance Mr Garrick whose experience of stage decorum and the mechanic operation of incidents and sentiments on the judgment and passions of an audience was by long attention become very great With these advantages and all those others which Mr Garrick's zeal prompted him to supply such as magnificent scenery splendid and wellchosen dresses and a distribution of the principal parts himself taking a very active one to the best performers then living namely Barry Mrs Cibber and Mrs Pritchard it was in the winter of the year presented to a polite a numerous and an unprejudiced audience Never was there such a display of eastern magnificence as this spectacle exhibited nor ever were fine moral sentiments more strongly enforced by correct and energetic utterance and just action than in the representation of this laboured tragedy but the diction of the piece was cold and philosophical it came from the head of the writer and reached not the hearts of the hearers The consequence whereof was that it was received with cold applause and having reached to a ninth night's performance was laid by During the representation Johnson was behind the scenes and thinking his character of an author required upon the occasion some distinction of dress he appeared in a goldlaced waistcoat  The truth of the above assertion as to the language of this tragedy is to be judged of by the perusal of it for notwithstanding its ill success as a dramatic representation Johnson found his account in giving it to the world as a poem Of the fable the characters  and the sentiments it is beside my purpose to speak they are also now open to examination It is nevertheless worthy of a remark that the author has shewn great judgment in deviating from historical verity as will appear by a comparison of the drama with the story as related by Knolles and abridged in a foregoing page for whereas the historian describes Irene as endowed with the perfections as well of the mind as of the body and relates that she was an innocent victim to the ferocity of a tyrant Johnson thought that such a catastrophe was too shocking for representation and has varied the narrative by making the lady renounce her religion and subjecting her to the suspicion of being a joint conspirator in a plot to assassinate the Sultan but of which he is afterwards convinced she is innocent  In thus altering the story it must however be confessed that much of its beauty is destroyed and the character of Mahomet represented with none of those terrible graces that dignify the narrative his public love and command over himself are annihilated and he is exhibited as a tyrant and a voluptuary  The world soon formed an opinion of the merit of Irene which has never fluctuated a representation during nine nights was as much as a tragedy which excited no passion could claim for however excellent its precepts and however correct its language that it wants those indispensable qualities in the drama interest and pathos cannot be denied We read it admit every position it advances commend it lay it by and forget it our attention is not awakened by any eminent beauties for its merit is uniform throughout  all the personages good or bad are philosophers those who execute and those who issue the orders talk the same language the characters cause no anxiety for the virtuous are superior to all mortal calamity and the vicious beneath our care the fate of Irene though deplorable is just notwithstanding she suffers by a false accusation her apostacy and treachery to her friend deserve punishment the morality it is needless to say of Johnson's spontaneous productions is excellent but how were unimpassioned precepts to make their way alone where variety business and plot are always expected where lively nonsense and pathetic imbecillity often succeed against the conviction of reason Or how could it be hoped that frigid virtue could attract those who suffer their pity to be easily moved either by the hero or the villain if he has the address first to engage their passions  Of the expectations that Johnson had entertained of the success of his tragedy no conjecture can now be formed If they are to be judged of by his outward demeanour after the town had consigned it to oblivion they were not very sanguine indeed the receipt of three nights must have afforded him some consolation and we must suppose that he increased the emolument thence arising by the sale of the copy We are therefore not to impute it to the disappointment of a hope that the play would be better received than it was that in the winter of the same year he published another imitation of Juvenal viz of his tenth satire with the title of  'The vanity of human wishes'  the subject whereof as it is an enumeration of the evils to which mankind are exposed could not at any period of his life have been other than a  tempting one Pursuing the track of his author he expatiates on the miseries that await empire grandeur wealth and power and the disappointments that frustrate the hopes of ambition learning eloquence and beauty in all which instances he has been able to point out examples the most striking and apposite  The poem concludes with an answer to an enquiry that must necessarily result from the perusal of the foregoing part of it viz what are the consolations that human life affords or in other words in whom or on what is a virtuous man to rest his hope the resolution of this question is contained in the following lines which for dignity of sentiment for pious instruction and purity of style are hardly to be equalled by any in our language  Where then shall hope and fear their objects find  Must dull suspense corrupt the stagnant mind  Must helpless man in ignorance sedate  Roll darkling down the torrent of his fate  Must no dislike alarm no wishes rise  No cries invoke the genius of the skies  Enquirer cease petitions yet remain  Which Heav'n may hear nor deem religion vain  Still raise for good the supplicating voice  But leave to Heav'n the measure and the choice  Safe in his pow'r whose eyes discern afar  The secret ambush of a specious pray'r  Implore his aid in his decisions rest  Secure whate'er he gives he gives the best  Yet when the sense of sacred presence fires  And strong devotion to the skies aspires  Pour forth thy fervours for a healthful mind  Obedient passions and a will resign'd  For love which scarce collective man can fill  For patience sov'reign o'er transmuted ill  For faith that panting for a happier seat  Counts death kind nature's signal of retreat  These goods for man the laws of Heav'n ordain  These goods he grants who grants the pow'r to gain  With these celestial wisdom calms the mind  And makes the happiness she does not find  In the following year it having been discovered that a granddaughter of Milton was living Mr Garrick was prevailed on to permit the representation of the Masque of Comus at his theatre for her benefit Upon this occasion Johnson forgetting the enmity which he had always borne towards Milton wrote a prologue wherein he calls the attention of the audience to his memory and without imputing to his descendant any other merit than industrious poverty and conjugal fidelity implores them to crown desert beyond the grave  Johnson's beneficence was of the most diffusive kind Distress was the general motive and merit whether in the object or any to whom he claimed relation the particular incentive to it There was living at this time a man of the name of De Groot a painter by profession and no contemptible artist who after having travelled over England and at low prices painted as many persons as could be persuaded to sit to him settled in London and became reduced to poverty him Oldys or some one other of his friends introduced to Johnson who found out  by his conversation that he was a descendant of Grotius and thereupon exerting his interest in his behalf he procured for him an admission into the Charterhouse in which comfortable retreat he died  Johnson was all this while working at the dictionary having to assist him a number of young persons whose employment it was to distribute the articles with sufficient spaces for the definitions which it is easy to discern are of his own composition  Of these his assistants some were young men of parts others mere drudges Among the former was one of the name of Shiells a Scotchman the author of a poem in blank verse intitled  'Beauty'  and also of a collection of the lives of the poets in four volumes which for a gratuity of ten guineas Theophilus Cibber suffered to be printed with his name a book of no authority other than what it derives from Winstanley Langbaine and Jacob and in other respects of little worth but concerning which it is fit that the following fact should be made known Cibber at the time of making this bargain was under confinement for debt in the king'sbench prison and with a view to deceive the public into a belief that the book was of his father's writing it was concerted between the negotiators of it and himself to suppress his christian name and that it should be printed as a work of Mr Cibber  The intense application with which he was obliged to pursue his work deprived Johnson of many of the pleasures he most delighted in as namely reading in his desultory manner and the conversation of his friends It also increased his constitutional melancholy and at times excited in him a loathing of that  employment to which he could not but look upon himself as doomed by his necessities The sum for which he had stipulated with the booksellers was by the terms of the agreement to be paid as the work went on and was indeed his only support Being thus compelled to spend every day like the past he looked on himself as in a state of mental bondage and reflecting that while he was thus employed his best faculties lay dormant was unwillingly willing to work  And here we cannot but reflect on that inertness and laxity of mind which the neglect of order and regularity in living and the observance of stated hours in short the waste of time is apt to lead men to this was the source of Johnson's misery throughout his life all he did was by fits and starts and he had no genuine impulse to action either corporal or mental That the compilation of such a work as he was engaged in was necessarily productive of that languor which in the prosecution of it he manifested is by no means clear all employments all occupations whatever are intrinsically indifferent and excite neither pain nor pleasure but as the mind is disposed towards them Fame mere posthumous fame has engaged men to similar undertakings and they have pursued them with zeal and even delight Canne the editor of a bible printed in spent many years in collecting parallel passages in the Old and New Testament to such a number as to croud the margin of the book and in the preface thereto he declares that it was the most delightful employment of his life and what but a real pleasure in that kind of labour  and the consideration of its benefit to mankind could be the inducement with such a man as Hoffman to compile a lexicon more than twice as voluminous as that of Johnson  And to speak more at large viz of men who have benefited the world by their literary labours avowing as their motive the desire of gain we find not all infected with that disease which as it affected Johnson may almost be said to have converted all his mental nutriment to poison on the contrary there have been many who mixed with the world and by a good use of their time were capable of great application and enjoying the benefits of society and of these I shall mention three persons his contemporaries men of very different characters from each other all authors by profession and of great eminence in literature  The first was the reverend Dr Thomas Birch a divine of the church of England but originally a quaker In his youth he was passionately fond of reading and being indulged in it by his father became successively usher to two schools in which the sons of quakers were educated He married at the age of twentythree but in less than a year became a widower Having had the happiness of a recommendation to Sir Philip Yorke then attorneygeneral and being honoured with his favour and patronage he in entered into holy orders and was presented to a rectory and also to a vicarage in Gloucestershire Soon after this in conjunction with the reverend Mr Bernard the wellknown Mr John Lockman and Mr George Sale the translator of the  Koran he compiled a general biographical dictionary in ten volumes in folio including therein a translation of that of Bayle and collected and published Thurloe's state papers in seven folio volumes and was the editor of lord Bacon's Mr Boyle's and archbishop Tillotson's works as also of the prose writings of Milton and the miscellaneous pieces of Sir Walter Raleigh and the works of Mrs Elizabeth Cockburn He was first a fellow of and afterwards secretary to the royal society and wrote a history thereof In the Marischal college at Aberdeen conferred on him the degree of doctor in divinity and the year after he received the same honour from archbishop Herring The above is but a partial enumeration of his publications for he wrote the lives of Henry prince of Wales of Bacon Boyle Milton and Tillotson and other persons and many tracts not here noticed In the midst of all this employment Dr Birch was to be seen at home at the Royal and Antiquarian societies at Sion college at the academy of ancient music which had long subsisted at the Crown and Anchor in the Strand at Tom's coffeehouse in Devereux court in short in all places where a clergyman might with propriety appear Nor was this all he found time for the exercise of walking before many people were stirring I have been with him at nine in a winter's morning and have found him just returned from an excursion of some miles  I heard him once relate that he had the curiosity to measure the circuit of London by a perambulation thereof the account he gave was to this effect He set out from his house in the Strand towards Chelsea and having reached the bridge beyond the waterworks he directed his course to Marybone from whence pursuing an eastern direction he skirted the town and crossed the Islington road at the Angel There was at the time no cityroad but passing through Hoxton he got to Shoreditch thence to Bethnal green and from thence to Stepney where he recruited his spirits with a glass of brandy From Stepney he passed on to Limehouse and took into his rout the adjacent hamlet of Poplar when he became sensible that to complete his design he must take in Southwark this put him to a stand but he soon determined on his course for taking a boat he landed at the red house at Deptford and made his way to Say's court where the great wetdock is and keeping the houses along Rotherhithe to the right he got to Bermondsey thence by the south end of Kentstreet to Newington and over St George's fields to Lambeth and crossing over to Millbank continued his way to Charing cross and along the Strand to Norfolk street from whence he had set out The whole of this excursion took him up from nine in the morning to three in the afternoon and according to his rate of walking he computed the circuit of London at above twenty miles With the buildings erected since it may be supposed to have increased five miles and if so the present circumference of this great metropolis is about half that of ancient Rome  He held a conversation on Sunday evenings  with his friends who were men of the first eminence for learning and intelligence at his house in Norfolk street in the Strand  Formerly the habitation of the famous William Penn the quaker of whom it is well known that his circumstances at a certain period of his life were so involved that it was not safe for him to go abroad He chose this house it being at the south west corner of the street as one from whence he might upon occasion slip out by water In the entrance to it he had a peepinghole through which he could see any persons that came to him One of these who had sent in his name having been made to wait more than a reasonable time knocked for the servant whom he asked  'Will not thy master see me' 'Friend' answered the servant 'he has seen thee but he does not like thee'  The fact was that Penn had from his station taken a view of him and found him to be a creditor  in which all particularly  the library was neat and elegant without litter or disorder  The mental endowments of Dr Birch were singular he had a great eagerness after knowledge and a memory very retentive of facts but his learning properly so called bore no proportion to his reading for he was in truth neither a mathematician a natural philosopher a classical scholar nor a divine but in a small degree all and though lively in conversation he was but a dullwriter Johnson was used to speak of him in this manner  'Tom is a lively rogue he remembers a great deal and can tell many pleasant stories but a pen is to Tom a torpedo the touch of it benumbs his hand and his brain Tom can talk but he is no writer'  And indeed whoever peruses his writings will be much of the same opinion his life of Tillotson is a mere detail of unconnected facts without the intermixture of sentiment or disquisition and of the style let this citation serve as a specimen Speaking of Wilkins he makes a transition to Tillotson whom he characterizes in these words and meaner he could not have found  'He went into all the very best things that were in that great man but so as he improved every one of them'  In the midst of all his labours and pursuits Dr Birch preserved an even temper of mind and a great chearfulness of spirits Ever desirous to learn and willing to communicate he was uniformly affable courteous and disposed to conversation His life was spent without reproach but terminated by an unhappy accident a fall from his horse on the Hampstead road on the th day of January His  preferments in the church though successively numerous were small and never reached to dignities the last of them were the rectories of St Margaret Pattens London and of Depden in Essex  Dr John Campbell was an eminent writer and a labourer in a voluminous work undertaken at the expence and risque of the booksellers the Universal History Besides many other books he wrote the lives of the English admirals in four octavo volumes He had a considerable hand in the Biographia Britannica and was the author of a valuable work in two quarto volumes intitled  'A political survey of Britain'  being a series of reflections on the situation lands inhabitants revenues colonies and commerce of this island intended to shew that they have not as yet approached to near the summit of improvement but that it will afford employment for many ages before they push to their utmost extent the natural advantages of Great Britain The reputation of this work extended to the most remote parts of Europe and induced the empress of Russia in the year to honour the author with a present of her picture By the exercise of his pen alone and a good use of his time he was for many years enabled to support himself and enjoy the comforts of domestic life in the society of an excellent wife and a numerous offspring In he was appointed his majesty's agent for the province of Georgia in North America and was thereby raised to a state of comparative affluence His residence for some years before his death was the large newbuilt house situate at the northwest corner of Queen square Bloomsbury whither particularly on a Sunday evening great numbers of persons of the  first eminence for science and literature were accusTomed to resort for the enjoyment of conversation He died in having nearly completed the sixtyeighth year of his age leaving behind him the character of a learned an ingenious and a pious man  Dr John Hill was originally an apothecary and a student in botany in which he was encouraged by the late duke of Richmond and lord Petre but finding that an unprofitable pursuit he made two or three attempts as a writer for the stage a failure in them drove him back to his former study in the course whereof he got introduced to Mr Martin Folkes and Mr Henry Baker leading members of the royal society who finding him a young man of parts and well skilled in natural history recommended him among their friends His first publication was a translation from the Greek of a small tract Theophrastus on gems which being printed by subscription produced him some money and such a reputation as induced the booksellers to engage him in writing a general natural history in two volumes in folio and soon after a supplement to Chambers's dictionary He had received no academical education but his ambition prompting him to be a graduate he obtained from one of those universities which would scarce refuse a degree to an apothecary's horse a diploma for that of doctor of physic After this he engaged in a variety of works the greater part whereof were mere compilations which he sent forth with incredible expedition and though his character was never in such estimation with the booksellers as to entitle him to an extraordinary price for his writings he has been  known by such works as those abovementioned by novels pamphlets and a periodical paper called  'The Inspector'  the labour of his own head and hand to have earned in one year the sum of l He was vain conceited and in his writings disposed to satire and licentious scurrility which he indulged without any regard to truth and thereby became engaged in frequent disputes and quarrels that always terminated in his own disgrace For some abuse in his Inspector of a gentleman of the name of Brown he had his head broke in the circus of Ranelagh gardens He insulted Woodward the player in the face of an audience and engaged with him in a pamphletwar in which he was foiled  It was said of Hill that when he met in any botanic garden with a curious plant that was portable he would convey it away and that he was once detected in an attempt of that kind Woodward in a pamphlet written against him alluded to this fact by prefixing to it as a motto this apposite citation from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet  I do remember an apothecary    Culling of simples  He attacked the royal society in a review of their transactions and abused his old friends Mr Folkes and Mr Baker for opposing on account of his infamous character his admission among them as a member In the midst of all this employment he found time and means to drive about the town in his chariot and to appear abroad and at all public places at Batson's coffeehouse at masquerades and at the opera and playhouses splendidly dressed and as often as he could in the front row of  the boxes Towards the end of his life his reputation as an author was so sunk by the slovenliness of his compilations and his disregard to truth in what he related that he was forced to betake himself to the vending a few simple medicines namely essence of waterdock tincture of Valerian balsam of honey and elixir of Bardana and by pamphlets ascribing to them greater virtues than they had imposed on the credulity of the public and thereby got though not an honest a competent livelihood  Two years before his death he had as he gave out received from the king of Sweden the investiture of knight of one of the orders of that kingdom in return for a present to that monarch of his  'Vegetable system'  in twentysix folio volumes With all his folly and malignity he entertained a sense of religion and wrote a vindication of God and nature against the shallow philosophy of lord Bolingbroke  Besides these there was another class of authors who lived by writing that require to be noticed the former were in fact pensioners of the booksellers these vended their compositions when completed to those of that trade who would give most for them They were mostly books of mere entertainment that were the subjects of this kind of commerce and were and still are distinguished by the corrupt appellation of novels and romances Though fictitious and the work of mere invention they pretended to probability to be founded in nature and to delineate social manners The first publication of the kind was the  'Pamela'  of Mr  Richardson  Pamela is the name of a lady one of the principal characters in Sir Philip Sidney's  'Arcadia'  and is thus accented Pamēla So Mr Pope  The Gods to curse Pamēla with her pray'rs  Gave the gilt coach and dappled Flanders mares  But Richardson whether through ignorance or design and also all his female pupils constantly pronounced it Pamēla  which being read with great eagerness by the young people of the time and recommended from the pulpit begat such a craving for more of the same stuff as tempted some men whose necessities and abilities were nearly commensurate to try their success in this new kind of writing  At the head of these we must for many reasons place Henry Fielding one of the most motley of literary characters This man was in his early life a writer of comedies and farces very few of which are now remembered after that a practising barrister with scarce any business then an antiministerial writer and quickly after a creature of the duke of Newcastle who gave him a nominal qualification of l a year and set him up as a tradingjustice in which disreputable station he died He was the author of a romance intitled  'The history of Joseph Andrews'  and of another  'The Foundling or the history of Tom Jones'  a book seemingly intended to sap the foundation of that morality which it is the duty of parents and all public instructors to inculcate in the minds of young people by teaching that virtue upon principle is imposture that generous qualities alone constitute true worth and that a young  man may love and be loved and at the same time associate with the loosest women His morality in respect that it resolves virtue into good affections in contradiction to moral obligation and a sense of duty is that of lord Shaftesbury vulgarised and is a system of excellent use in palliating the vices most injurious to society He was the inventor of that cantphrase goodness of heart which is every day used as a substitute for probity and means little more than the virtue of a horse or a dog in short he has done more towards corrupting the rising generation than any writer we know of  He afterwards wrote a book of the same kind but of a less mischievous tendency his  'Amelia'  For each of these he was well paid by Andrew Millar the bookseller and for the last he got six hundred pounds  Dr Tobias Smollet another writer of familiar romance and a dealer with the booksellers was originally a surgeon's mate and served at the siege of Carthagena His first publication of this kind was  'The adventures of Roderick Random'  and his next those of Peregrine Pickle in which is introduced the history of a wellknown woman of quality written as it is said by herself under the name of lady Frail These and other compositions of the like kind Smollet sold to the booksellers at such rates as enabled him to live without the exercise of his profession He had a hand in  'The universal history'  and translated Gil Blas and also Telemachus The success of the former of these tempted him to translate  'Don Quixote'  which as he understood not the Spanish language he could only do through the medium of the French and  the former English versions none of which do as it is said convey the humour of the original It might seem that Jarvis's translation was one impediment to such an undertaking but that though it gives the sense of the author was performed by persons whose skill in the language was not great The fact is that Jarvis laboured at it many years but could make but little progress for being a painter by profession he had not been accustomed to write and had no style Mr Tonson the bookseller seeing this suggested the thought of employing Mr Broughton the reader at the Temple church the author and editor of sundry publications who as I have been informed by a friend of Tonson sat himself down to study the Spanish language and in a few months acquired as was pretended sufficient knowledge thereof to give to the world a translation of Don Quixote in the true spirit of the original and to which is prefixed the name of Jarvis  I might here speak of Richardson as a writer of fictitious history but that he wrote for amusement and that the profits of his writings though very great were accidental He was a man of no learning nor reading but had a vivid imagination which he let loose in reflections on human life and manners till it became so distended with sentiments that for his own case he was necessitated to vent them on paper In the original plan of his  'Clarissa'  it was his design as his bookseller once told me to continue it to the extent of twentyfour volumes but he was with great difficulty prevailed on to comprise it in six The character of Richardson as a writer is to this day undecided otherwise than by the avidity with which  his publications are by some readers perused and the sale of numerous editions He has been celebrated as a writer similar in genius to Shakespeare as being acquainted with the inmost recesses of the human heart and having an absolute command of the passions so as to be able to affect his readers as himself is affected and to interest them in the successes and disappointments the joys and sorrows of his characters Others there are who think that neither his  'Pamela'  his  'Clarissa'  nor his  'Sir Charles Grandison'  are to be numbered among the books of rational and instructive amusement that they are not to be compared to the novels of Cervantes or the more simple and chaste narrations of Le Sage that they are not just representations of human manners that in them the turpitude of vice is not strongly enough marked and that the allurements to it are represented in the gayest colours that the texture of all his writings is flirnsy and thin and his style mean and feeble that they have a general tendency to inflame the passions of young people and to teach them that which they need not to be taught and that though they pretend to a moral it often turns out a bad one The cant terms of him and his admirers are sentiment and sentimentality  Johnson was inclined as being personally acquainted with Richardson to favour the former opinion of his writings but he seemed not firm in it and could at any time be talked into a disapprobation of all fictitious relations of which he would frequently say they took no hold of the mind  I am tired of adducing instances of men who lived by the profession of writing and thought it  an eligible one and should now proceed to relate the subsequent events of Dr Johnson's life and mark the state of his mind at different periods but that I find myself detained by a character which as it were obtrudes itself to view and is of importance enough to claim notice  Laurence Sterne a clergyman and a dignitary of the cathedral church of York was remarkable for a wild and eccentric genius resembling in many respects that of Rabelais The work that made him first known as a writer was  'The life and opinions of Tristram Shandy'  a whimsical rhapsody but abounding in wit and humour of the licentious kind He too was a sentimentalist and wrote sentimental journies and sentimental letters in abundance by which both he and the booksellers got considerably Of the writers of this class or sect it may be observed that being in general men of loose principles bad oeconomists living without foresight it is their endeavour to commute for their failings by professions of greater love to mankind more tender affections and finer feelings than they will allow men of more regular lives whom they deem formalists to possess Their generous notions supersede all obligation they are a law to themselves and having good hearts and abounding in the milk of human kindness are above those considerations that bind men to that rule of conduct which is founded in a sense of duty Of this new school of morality Fielding Rousseau and Sterne are the principal teachers and great is the mischief they have done by their documents  To these I might add the names of sundry persons of the same occupation the authors of the Universal history in forty folio volumes but that only a few of them are at this distance of time known those are Psalmanaazar George Sale the above Dr Campbell and Mr George Shelvocke who of a boy bred to the sea became a man of learning a travelling tutor and at length attained to the lucrative employment of secretary of the postoffice Of these men it may be said that they were miners in literature they worked though not in darkness under ground their motive was gain their labour silent and incessant  From the above enumeration of characters and particulars it may be inferred that Johnson's indolence and melancholy were diseases of his mind and not the necessary consequence of the profession he had taken up that he saw human life through a false medium and that he voluntarily renounced many comforts gratifications and even pleasures obviously in his power One effort however he made to soothe his mind and palliate the fatigue of his labours which I here relate  The great delight of his life was conversation and mental intercourse That he might be able to indulge himself in this he had in the winter of formed a club that met weekly at the King's head a famous beefsteak house in Ivy lane near St Paul's every Tuesday evening Thither he constantly resorted and with a disposition to please and be pleased would pass those hours in a free and unrestrained interchange of sentiments which otherwise had been  spent at home in painful reflection The persons who composed this little society were nine in number I will mention their names and as well as I am able give a slight sketch of the several characters of such of them as cannot now be affected by either praise or blame they were the reverend Dr Salter father of the late master of the CharterhouseDr HawkesworthMr Ryland a merchant a relation of hisMr John Payne then a bookseller but now or very lately chief accountant of the bankMr Samuel Dyer a learned young man intended for the dissenting ministryDr William M'Ghie a Scots physicianDr Edmund Barker a young physicianDr Richard Bathurst also a young physician and myself  Dr Samuel Salter was a Cambridge divine whom some disagreement between him and his children had driven from his abode at Norwich at the age of seventy to settle in London Being thus far advanced in years he could carry his recollection back to the time when Dr Samuel Clarke was yet a member of that university and would frequently entertain us with particulars respecting him He was a dignitary of the church I think archdeacon of Norfolk a man of general reading but no deep scholar he was wellbred courteous and affable and enlivened conversation by the relation of a variety of curious facts of which his memory was the only register  Dr Hawkesworth is a character well known in the literary world I shall not attempt a delineation of it as I find in the biographic dictionary an article for him in the words following  'John Hawkesworth an English writer of a very  soft and pleasing cast was born about the year though his epitaph as we find it in the Gentleman's Magazine" for August makes him to have been born in He was brought up to a mechanical profession that of a watchmaker as is supposed  This is a mistake He had been taught no art but that of writing and was a hired clerk to one Harwood an attorney in Grocers' alley in the Poultry  He was of the sect of presbyterians and a member of the celebrated Tom Bradbury's meeting from which he was expelled for some irregularities He afterwards devoted himself to literature and became an author of considerable eminence In the early part of his life his circumstances were rather confined He resided some time at Bromley in Kent where his wife kept a boardingschool He afterwards became known to a lady who had great property and interest in the EastIndia company and through her means was chosen a director of that body As an author his  'Adventurer'  is his capital work the merits of which if we mistake not procured him the degree of LLD from Herring archbishop of Canterbury When the design of compiling a narrative of the discoveries in the South seas was on foot he was recommended as a proper person to be employed on the occasion but in truth he was not a proper person nor did the performance answer expectation Works of taste and elegance where imagination and the passions were to be affected were his province not works of dry cold accurate narrative However he executed his task and is said  to have received for it the enormous sum of He died in some say of high living others of chagrin from the ill reception of his  'Narrative'  for he was a man of the keenest sensibility and obnoxious to all the evils of such irritable natures'  Mr Samuel Dyer was the son of a jeweller of eminence in the city who by his ingenuity and industry had acquired a competent fortune He as also his wife were dissenters persons very religiously disposed members of Chandler's congregation in the Old Jewry and this their youngest son was educated by professor Ward at the time when he kept a private school in one of the alleys near Moorfields and from thence being intended by his father for the dissenting ministry was removed to Dr Dodderidge's academy at Northampton After having finished his studies in this seminary he was removed to Glasgow where under Dr Hutcheson he was instructed in the writings of the Greek moralists and went through several courses of ethics and metaphysics To complete this plan of a learned education the elder Mr Dyer by the advice of Dr Chandler sent his son to Leyden with a view to his improvement in the Hebrew literature under Schultens a celebrated professor in that university After two years' stay abroad Mr Dyer returned eminently qualified for the exercise of that profession to which his studies had been directed and great were the hopes of his friends that he would become one of its ornaments To speak of his attainments in knowledge he was an excellent classical scholar a great mathematician and natural philosopher well versed in the Hebrew and  master of the Latin French and Italian languages Added to these endowments he was of a temper so mild and in his conversation and demeanour so modest and unassuming that he engaged the attention and affection of all around him In all questions of science Johnson looked up to him and in his life of Watts among the poets has cited an observation of his that Watts had  'confounded the idea of space with that of empty space and did not consider that though space might be without matter yet matter being extended could not be without space'  It was now expected that Mr Dyer would attach himself to the profession for which so liberal and expensive an education was intended to qualify him and that he would under all the discouragements that attend nonconformity appear as a public teacher and by preaching give a specimen of his talents and this was the more wished as he was a constant attendant on divine worship and the whole of his behaviour suited to such a character But being pressed by myself and other of his friends he discovered an averseness to the undertaking which we conceived to arise from modesty but some time after found to have sprung from another cause  In this seeming state of suspence being master of his time his friend Dr Chandler found out for him an employment exactly suitable to his talents Dr Daniel Williams a dissenting minister who by marriage had become the owner of a very plentiful estate and was the founder of the library for the use of those of his profession in Redcross street by his will had directed that certain controversial and other religious  tracts of his writing should be translated into Latin and printed the second year after his death and five hundred of each given away and this bequest to be repeated when that number was disposed of  This part of his will had remained unexecuted from about the year and Dr Chandler being a trustee for the performance of it and empowered to offer an equivalent to any one that he should think equal to the undertaking proposed it to Mr Dyer and he accepted it but small was his progress in it before it began to grow irksome and the completing of the translation was referred to some one less averse to labour than himself  Having thus got rid of an employment to which no persuasions of his friends nor prospects of future advantage could reconcile him he became as it were emancipated from the bondage of puritanical forms and modes of living Mr Dyer commenced a man of the world and with a sober and temperate deliberation resolved on a participation of its pleasures and enjoyments His company though he was rather a silent than a talkative man was courted by many and he had frequent invitations to dinners to suppers and cardparties By these means he became insensibly a votary of pleasure and to justify this choice had reasoned himself into a persuasion that not only in the moral government of the world but in human manners through all the changes and fluctuations of fashion and caprice whatever is is right With this and other opinions equally tending to corrupt his mind it must be supposed that he began to grow indifferent to the strict practice of religion and  the event shewed itself in a gradual declination from the exercises of it and his easy compliance with invitations to Sunday evening parties in which mere conversation was not the chief amusement  In his discourse he was exceedingly close and reserved it was nevertheless to be remarked of him that he looked upon the restraints on a life of pleasure with an unapproving eye He had an exquisite palate and had improved his relish for meats and drinks up to such a degree of resinement that I once found him in a fit of melancholy occasioned by a discovery that he had lost his taste for olives  He was a man of deep reflection and very able in conversation on most topics and after he had determined on his course of life which was to be of no profession but to become a gentleman at large living much at the houses of his friends he seemed to adopt the sentiments of a man of fashion In a visit that he made with a friend to France he met with a book with the title of  'Les Moeurs'  with which he was greatly delighted and at length became so enamoured of it and that free and liberal spirit which it manifests that after a conflict with his natural indolence in which he came off the victor he formed a resolution to translate it into English but after a small progress in the work the enemy rallied and defeated him Cave was his printer and had worked off only a few sheets when Mr Dyer's stock of copy was exhausted and his bookseller found himself reduced to the necessity of getting the translation finished by another hand which he did employing for the purpose a Mr Collyer the  author of  'Letters from Felicia to Charlotte'  and other innocent and some useful publications The translation was completed but upon its being sent abroad met with a rival one that involved Cave who was interested in the success of the book in an advertisementwar which he was left to conduct as he could  Few who are acquainted with this book will blame or wonder at Mr Dyer's partiality for it It is a work replete with good sense setting forth the excellence and the reasonableness of moral virtue in language so elegant and lively and with such forcible persuasion as cannot but win on a mind open to instruction  The earl of Chesterfield's voluminous exhortations to his son have been by some esteemed a system of education a system which sinks into nothing when compared either in its foundation or tendency to that contained in this concise code of ethics His lordship teaches the baser arts as means to that important end success in the world this writer that the good opinion of mankind is never to be purchased by deviating from the rule of right and that we seek in vain for happiness if we do not exert ourselves in the discharge of our several duties Principles such as these the disciples of the Graces are not likely to relish but it is nevertheless true that the unassuming the benevolent author of  'Les Moeurs'  understood the art of forming the character of a really fine gentleman much better than he who taught that infamy was the road to honour In short this is a work in praise of which there is no danger of being too lavish for those must be wise  indeed who are not informed by it and incorrigible whose tempers are not mended by it  What then shall we say of Mr Dyer who could read it approve it and so far shake off his natural phlegm as to declare himself fascinated by and actually begin a translation of it yet could abandon his work and sink into the very character against which it was an antidote but that sloth had obtained the dominion over him that a paralysis had seized his mental faculties and that rejecting the prudent counsels the moral precepts and the religious instruction contained in this elegant tract he had given himself up to criminal indolence and selfgratification and defeated the hopes of his best friends  In the translation into English much of the spirit of the original has evaporated but it has merit as some particulars which the different manners of the two nations made it fit to alter are properly adapted in it to the genius of our country and indeed the translation even if it had had less claim to our regard must have been acceptable as it extended the benefits of this valuable tract  Dyer's support in the idle way of life which he had made choice of was the produce of a patrimony in the funds that could not be great his father from whom he derived it having left besides himself a widow an elder son and a daughter Johnson and myself that he might be getting something strongly pressed him to write the life of Erasmus but he could not be induced to undertake it A work of less labour but less worthy of him he was however prevailed on  by Mr Samuel Sharp the surgeon to engage in this was a revision of the old translation of Plutarch's lives by several hands He undertook and with heavy complaints of the labour of his task completed it and had for his reward from Mr Draper the partner of Mr Tonson whom Mr Sharp had solicited to find some employment for him the sum of two hundred pounds  While he was a member of the club Johnson suspected that his religious principles for which at first he honoured him were giving way and it was whispered to me by one who seemed pleased that he was in the secret that Mr Dyer's religion was that of Socrates What farther advances he made in Theism I could not learn nor will I venture to assert that which some expressions that I have heard drop from him led me to fear viz that he denied in the philosophical sense of the term the freedom of the human will and settled in materialism and its consequent tenets  As all his determinations were slow and deliberate and seemed to be the result of reason and reflection the change in his principles and conduct here noted was gradual Of this the first symptoms were an imbecillity to resist any temptation abroad on a Sunday evening that should ease him of the trouble of such exercises as he had been accustomed to perform in the family of his mother and an eager curiosity in the perusal of books not merely of entertainment but of such as together with a knowledge of the world furnished his mind with such palliatives of vice as made him half a convert to it  While his mind was in this state of trepidation a young gentleman who had been a fellowstudent with him at Leyden arrived in England disordered in his health of whom and whose conversation he became so enamoured that to entertain him while he was seeking the recovery of it Dyer was almost lost to all the rest of his friends To those with whom he was most intimate he would notwithstanding the closeness of his nature describe him and display his attractions which as he represented them were learning wit politeness elegance particularly in the article of dress free and open manners a genteel figure and other personal charms that rendered him the delight of the female sex It was a question that some of those with whom he was thus open would frequently ask him  'What are the most of these qualifications to you Mr Dyer who are a man of a different character you who know the value of wisdom and have a mind fraught with knowledge which you are capable of applying to many beneficial purposes can never be emulous of those distinctions which discriminate a man of pleasure from a philosopher'  his answers to which served only to shew that his judgment was corrupted The habitation of his friend whom he thus visited was a brothel and his disease such as those seldom escape who frequent houses of lewd resort The solicitude which the females in that place shewed for the recovery of his friend their close attendance on him and assiduity in administering to him his medicines and supplying all his wants he attributed to genuine love and seemed almost to envy in him that power which could interest so many  young persons of the other sex in the restoration of his health  What effect these visits and the blandishments to which as often as he made them he was a witness had upon Dyer I know not save that to defeat the enchantments of these syrens he practised none of the arts of Ulysses on the contrary they seemed to have wrought in him an opinion that those mistook their interest and shewed their ignorance of human life who abstained from any pleasure that disturbed not the quiet of families or the order of society that natural appetites required gratification and were not to be dismissed without it that the indulgence of the irascible passions alone was vice and that to live in peace with all mankind and in a temper to do good offices was the most essential part of our duty  Having admitted these principles into his mind he settled into a sober sensualist in a perfect consistency with which character he was content to eat the bread of idleness laying himself open to the invitations of those that kept the best tables and contracting intimacies with men not only of opposite parties but with some who seemed to have abandoned all principle whether religious political or moral The houses of many such in succession were his home and for the gratifications of a wellspread table choice wines variety of company cardparties and a participation in all domestic amusements and recreations the owners thought themselves recompensed by his conversation and the readiness with which he accommodated himself to all about him Nor was he ever at a loss for reasons to justify this abuse of his parts or  waste of his time he looked upon the practice of the world as the rule of life and thought it did not become an individual to resist it  By the death of his mother his brother and sister all of whom he survived he became possessed of about l in the funds which as he was an oeconomist and inclined to no extravagance it seemed highly improbable he would ever be tempted to dissipate but he had contracted a fatal intimacy with some persons of desperate fortunes who were dealers in India stock at a time when the affairs of the company were in a state of fluctuation and though from his indolent and abstracted temper of mind and ignorance of business the last man to be suspected of yielding to such delusions he first invested all he had in that precarious fund and next became a candidate for the office of a director of the company but failed in his attempt After this he entered into engagements for the purchase or sale of stock and by violating them made shipwreck of his honour Lastly he made other contracts of the like kind to the performance whereof he was strictly bound these turned out against him and swallowed the whole of his fortune About the time of this event he was seized with a quinsey which he was assured was mortal but whether he resigned himself to the slow operation of that disease or precipitated his end by an act of selfviolence was and yet is a question among his friends He left not in money or effects sufficient to defray the expence of a decent funeral and the last office of humanity towards him was performed by one of those who had been accessary to his ruin A portrait  of him was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds and from it a mezzotinto was scraped the print whereof as he was little known sold only to his friends a singular use however was made of it Bell the publisher of the English poets caused an engraving to be made from it and prefixed it to the poems of Mr John Dyer  I have been thus particular in the history of this accomplished and hopeful young man whom I once loved with the affection of a brother with a view to shew the tendency of idleness and to point out at what avenues vice may gain admittance in minds seemingly the most strongly fortified The assailable part of his was laxity of principle at this entered infidelity which was followed by such temptations to pleasure as he could see no reason to resist these led on desires after the means of gratification and the pursuit of them was his destruction  M  c  Ghie was a Scotchman by birth and educated in one of the universities of that country for the profession of physic In the rebellion in he with a party of young men who as volunteers had associated on the side of government bore arms and was engaged in the skirmish at Falkirk which he ever spoke of as an illconducted business When matters were become pretty quiet in Scotland he took a doctor's degree and came to London where trusting to the friendship of his countrymen he hoped to succeed in practice but the town was overstocked with Scotch physicians and he met with small encouragement though by the favour of Dr Benjamin Avery the treasurer of Guy's hospital who had  been a dissenting teacher and at that time was at the head of that interest he got to be elected one of the physicians of that charity He was a learned ingenious and modest man and one of those few of his country whom Johnson could endure To say the truth he treated him with great civility and may almost be said to have loved him He inherited a patrimony too small for his subsistence and failing in his hope of getting forward in his profession died of a broken heart and was buried by a contribution of his friends  Barker being by education a dissenter was sent to study physic at Leyden from whence he returned about the time I am speaking of He was introduced to us by Dyer and had been a fellowstudent with him and with Akenside Askew Munckley Mr Dyson of the house of commons and others few of whom are now living From the conversation of these persons he learned the principles of lord Shaftesbury's philosophy and became as most of them were a favourer of his notions and an acute reasoner on the subject of ethics He was an excellent classical scholar a deep metaphysician and had enriched his fancy by reading the Italian poets but he was a thoughtless young man and in all his habits of dress and appearance so slovenly as made him the jest of all his companions Physicians in his time were used to be full dressed and in his garb of a full suit a brown tyewig with a knot over one shoulder and a long yellowhilted sword and his hat under his arm he was a caricature In his religious principles he professed himself an unitarian for which Johnson so often  snubbed him that his visits to us became less and less frequent After such a description as that above it is needless to add that Barker succeeded ill in his profession Upon his leaving us he went to practise at Trowbridge in Wiltshire but at the end of two years returned to London and became librarian to the college of physicians in the room of Edwards the ornithologist but for some misbehaviour was displaced and died in obscurity  Dr Richard Bathurst was a native of Jamaica and the son of an eminent planter in that island who coming to settle in England placed his son in London in order to qualify him for the practice of physic In the course of his studies he became acquainted with Johnson and was greatly beloved by him for the pregnancy of his parts and the elegance of his manners Besides these he possessed the qualities that were most likely to recommend him in his profession but wanting friends could make no way in it He had just interest enough to be chosen physician to an hospital that was supported by precarious donations and which yielded him little or no recompence for his attendance which as it was only a few hours on certain days in the week left him in a great measure master of his time Of this he was a good manager employing it in the studies relative to his profession and the improvement of himself in polite literature In conjunction with Johnson Hawkesworth and others he wrote  'the Adventurer'  a periodical paper that will hereafter be spoken of pursuing at the same time the most prudent and probable methods for acquiring reputation and advancing himself in his profession but missing of success he embraced the  offer of an appointment of physician to the army that was sent on the expedition against the Havannah where soon after his arrival he was seized with a fever that then raged among the troops and which before he could be a witness of the reduction of the place put a period to an innocent and useful life  The Spaniards have a proverb that he who intends to be pope must think of nothing else Bathurst thought of becoming an eminent London physician and omitted no means to attain that character he studied hard dressed well and associated with those who were likely to bring him forward but he failed in his endeavours and shortly before his leaving England confessed to Johnson that in the course of ten years' exercise of his faculty he had never opened his hand to more than one guinea  The failure of three such persons as those abovementioned in a profession in which very many ignorant men have been known to succeed  So ignorant as to request of the college the indulgence of an examination in English  was matter of wonder to Johnson and all that knew them He obeyed that precept of Scripture which exhorts us to honour the physician and would frequently say of those of this country that they did more good to mankind without a prospect of reward than any profession of men whatever Bathurst's want of encouragement affected him much he often expressed to me his surprize that a young man of his endowments and engaging manners should succeed no better and his disappointment drew from him a reflection which he has inserted in his life of Akenside that by an acute observer who had looked on the transactions of the  medical world for half a century a very curious book might be written on the fortune of physicians Such a book I should be glad to see and if any person hereafter shall be induced to pursue Johnson's hint he may possibly think the following remarks which have occurred to me in the course of a long intimacy with some of the most eminent of the profession not altogether beneath his notice  Of the professors of medicine in cities remote from London and in country rowns I know but little but in the metropolis I am able to say that in my time not only the track of a young physician was pretty plainly pointed out and it is curious to follow it but that the conduct of such an one was reducible to a system Mead was the son of a nonconforming minister the teacher of a numerous congregation who trusting to his influence over them  The interest which the dissenting teachers had with the members of their several congregations though now but little known was formerly very great and in my memory was such that scarcely any member of a separate congregation would dispose of a daughter or make a purchase or advance a sum of money on a mortgage without first consulting his pastor  bred his son a physician with what success is well known  I have heard it said that when Mead began to practise he was a constant frequenter of the meeting at Stepney where his father preached and that when he was sent for out of the assembly which he often was his father would in his prayer insert a petition in behalf of the sick person I once mentioned this to Johnson who said it was too gross for belief but  was not so at Batson's it passed there as a current tradition  He raised the medical character to such a height of dignity as was never seen in this or any other country His example was an inducement with others of the dissenting ministers to make physicians  of their sons Oldfield Clark Nesbit Lobb and Munckley were the sons of dissenting teachers and they generally succeeded The hospital of St Thomas and that of Guy in Southwark were both under the government of dissenters and whigs and as soon as any one became physician of either his fortune was looked upon as made The mention of this circumstance brings to my remembrance a contest that to a degree proves the truth of my assertion Dr asterwards Sir Edward Hulse had been some years physician to St Thomas's hospital and being minded to resign had set his eye upon Dr Joseph Letherland a man of profound erudition for his successor Hoadly bishop of Winchester had about that time a son who having finished his studies in physic at Cambridge had taken his doctor's degree and was about to settle in London Hoadly was ever the idol of the whigs he encouraged his son to offer himself and the interest was divided Every nerve was strained and Hoadly missed his election by fewer than ten votes  It is remarkable of this person that upon this failure he abandoned his profession not so much perhaps because of his disappointment as of his principles To a friend of mine he confessed that he was as to the effects of medicine a sceptic for that upon the principles of philosophy he could not account for the operation of any one medicine on the human body He seemed in this instance to have adopted the sentiments of Montaigne who entertained the same doubt and somewhere in his essays describes a physician putting a pill into a patient's mouth with a commission to follow the circulation and act only on that part the toe for instance to which it is directed Of a different opinion was the father of the person abovementioned Hoadly bishop of Winchester when writing against the freethinkers he put this shrewd question  'Were all the mistakes and errors of physicians from the beginning of the world to this day collected into a volume would they afford a good reason against taking physic'    The same advantage attended the election of a physician to the hospitals of Bethlehem and St Bartholomew which are of royal foundation and have been under tory government By cultivating an interest with either of the two parties the succession of a young physician was almost insured The frequenting Batson's or Child's was a declaration of the side he took and his business was to be indiscriminately courteous and obsequious to all men to appear much abroad and in public places to increase his acquaintance and form good connexions in the doing whereof a wife if he were married that could visit play at cards and tattle was oftentimes very serviceable  The medical character whatever it is now was heretofore a grave one it implies learning and sagacity and therefore notwithstanding lord Shaftesbury's remark that gravity is of the very essence of imposture the candidates for practice though ever so young found it necessary to add to their endeavours a grave and solemn deportment even to affectation The physicians in Hogarth's prints are not caricatures the full dress with a sword and a great tyewig and the hat under the arm and the doctors in consultation each smelling to a goldheaded cane shaped like a parishbeadle's staff are pictures of real life in his time and myself have seen a young physician thus equipped walk the streets of London without attracting the eyes of passengers  A candidate for practice pursuing these methods and exercising the patience of a  settingdog for half a score years in the expectation of deaths resignations or other accidents that occasion vacancies at the end thereof either found himself an hospital physician  To these observations on the profession of physic and the fate of its practitioners I here add an anecdote of no less a person than Dr Mead himself who very early in his life attained to this station of eminence and met with all the subsequent encouragement due to his great merit and who nevertheless died in a state of indigence  The income arising from his practice I have heard estimated at l a year and he had one if not two fortunes left him not by relations but by friends no way allied to him but his munificence was so great and his passion for collecting books paintings and curiosities so strong that he made no savings His manuscripts he parted with in his lifetime to supply his wants which towards his end were become so pressing that he once requested of the late lord Orrery the loan of five guineas on some toys viz pieces of kennelcoal wrought into vases and other elegant forms which he produced from his pocket This story incredible as it may seem lord Orrery told Johnson and from him I had it  and if of Bethlehem a monopolist of one and that a very lucrative branch of practice or doomed to struggle with difficulties for the remainder of his life  Jurin Shaw James and some few others recommended themselves to practice by their writings but in general the methods of acquiring it I speak of the city were such as are above described One and only one of the profession I am able to name who pursued a different conduct and under the greatest disadvantages succeeded  This person was Dr Meyer Schomberg a native of Cologne who being a jew and as I have heard related of him librarian to some person of distinction abroad  left that occupation and came and settled in London Being of no profession and having the means of a livelihood to seek he was at a pause but at length determined on one and took it up in a manner that will be best described by his own words to a friend of mine  'I said I was a physician'  Having thus assumed a profession he cultivated an intimacy with the jews in Duke's place and by their means got introduced to the acquaintance of some of the leading men merchants and others of that religion who employed him and by their interest recommended him to a practice that in a few years amounted as he once told me himself to a thousand pounds a year He was a man of an insinuating address and as he understood mankind very well having renounced the ritual distinctions of his religion he soon found out a method of acquiring popularity which had never been practised by any of his profession he took a large house in the city and kept a public table to which on a certain day in the week all the young surgeons and apothecaries were welcome and at which all that were present were treated with an indiscriminate civility that had very much the appearance of friendship but meant nothing more than that they should recommend him to practice The scheme succeeded in the year Schomberg had outstripped all the cityphysicians and was in the annual receipt of four thousand pounds  To enable him to practice he had at his setting out procured to be admitted a licentiate of the college but that permission had been granted him with so ill a grace or was followed by some circumstances that  provoked his resentment so highly that he seemed resolved on a perpetual enmity against the members of that body who on their part looking on him as little better than a foreign mountebank declined as much as possible meeting him in consultation and thereby for some time checked his practice  He had a son whom he brought up to his own profession who took it into his head that having been admitted a licentiate he was virtually a fellow and claimed to be admitted as such his father encouraged him and instituted a process in his behalf of which there had been no precedent since the time that Jefferies was chancellor It was no less than a petition to the king requesting him in the person of the lordchancellor to exercise his visitatorial power over the college and restore the licentiates to their rights which by their arbitrary proceedings the president and fellows had for a succession of ages deprived them of This petition came on to be heard at Lincoln'sinn hall before the lord chief justice Willes the lord chiefbaron Smythe and Sir John Eardley Wilmot lords commissioners of the great seal but the allegations therein contained not being sufficiently supported the same was dismissed it was nevertheless looked on as the most sormidable attack on the college it had ever sustained and may be said to have shaken its constitution to the very centre  Political associations and religious sects are excellent nurses to young men of professions especially of that of which I am speaking Ratcliffe and Freind owed their fortunes to the support of the tories and jacobites Mead and Hulse to the whigs and Schomberg to the jews The quakers also no contemptible  body of men had power and interest sufficient to introduce into great practice one of their own denomination this was John Fothergill a young man of parts and industry who being bred an apothecary and having obtained a Scotch degree settled in London and attached himself to Schomberg taking him in many parts of his conduct for his exemplar so that upon Schomberg's decease he slid into his practice and became one of the most popular of the city physicians These two persons first one and then the other for full thirty years carried all before them and within that space of time not fewer than twenty of the profession whom I could name lived in great straits some of them leaving at their decease scarce sufficient to bury them  From these and many other instances that might be produced it is evident that neither learning parts nor skill nor even all these united are sufficient to ensure success in the profession I am speaking of and that without the concurrence of adventitious circumstances which no one can pretend to define a physician of the greatest merit may be lost to the world and further it may be said that the fairest hopes may be frustrated by the want of that quality which Swift somewhere calls an aldermanly virtue discretion but is in truth of greater efficacy in our intercourse with mankind than all science put together Had Akenside been possessed of this gift he had probably become the first in his faculty but that he was able to acquire no other kind of celebrity than that of a scholar and a poet is to be accounted for by some particulars in his life and conduct with which few but myself who  knew him well are acquainted and which I here insert as suppletory to those which Johnson has recorded of him Mr Dyson and he were fellow students the one of law and the other of physic at Leyden where being of congenial tempers a friendship commenced between them that lasted through their lives They left the university at the same time and both settled in London Mr Dyson took to the bar and being possessed of a handsome fortune supported his friend while he was endeavouring to make himself known as a physician but in a short time having purchased of Mr Hardinge his place of clerk of the house of commons he quitted Westminster hall and for the purpose of introducing Akenside to acquaintance in an opulent neighbourhood near the town bought a house at NorthEnd Hampstead where they dwelt together during the summer season frequenting the long room and all clubs and assemblies of the inhabitants  At these meetings which as they were not select must be supposed to have consisted of such persons as usually meet for the purpose of gossiping men of wealth but of ordinary endowments and able to talk of little else than news and the occurrences of the day Akenside was for displaying those talents which had acquired him the reputation he enjoyed in other companies but here they were of little use to him on the contrary they tended to engage him in disputes that betrayed him into a contempt of those that differed in opinion from him It was found out that he was a man of low birth and a dependant on Mr Dyson circumstances that furnished those whom he offended with a ground of reproach  that reduced him to the necessity of asserting in terms that he was a gentleman  Little could be done at Hampstead after matters had proceeded to this extremity Mr Dyson parted with his villa at NorthEnd and settled his friend in a small house in Bloomsbury square assigning for his support such a part of his income as enabled him to keep a chariot  In this new situation Akenside used every endeavour to become popular but defeated them all by the high opinion he every where manifested of himself and the little condescension he shewed to men of inferior endowments by his love of political controversy his authoritative censure of the public councils and his bigotted notions respecting government subjects soreign to his profession and with which some of the wisest of it have thought it prudent not to concern themselves In the winter evenings he frequented Tom's coffeehouse in Devereux court then the resort of some of the most eminent men for learning and ingenuity of the time with some of whom he became entangled in disputes and altercations chiefly on subjects of literature and politics that fixed on his character the stamp of haughtiness and selfconceit and drew him into disagreeable situations  There was at that time a man of the name of Ballow who used to pass his evenings in the society abovementioned a lawyer by profession  He was the author of a treatise on equity in folio published without a name  but of no practice he having by the interest of some of the Townshends to whom he had been a kind of law tutor obtained a place in the exchequer which yielded him a handsome  income and exempted him from the necessity of attending Westminsterhall He was a man of deep and extensive learning but of vulgar manners and being of a splenetic temper envied Akenside for that eloquence which he displayed in his conversation and set his own phraseology very low Moreover he hated him for his republican principles and finally being himself a man of solid learning affected to treat him as a pretender to literature and made it his study to provoke him  One evening at the coffeehouse a dispute between these two persons rose so high that for some expression uttered by Ballow Akenside thought himself obliged to demand an apology which not being able to obtain he sent his adversary a challenge in writing Ballow a little deformed man well known as a saunterer in the park about Westminster and in the streets between Charing cross and the houses of parliament though remarkable for a sword of an unusual length which he constantly wore when he went abroad had no inclination for fighting and declined an answer The demand of satisfaction was followed by several attempts on the part of Akenside to see Ballow at his lodgings but he kept close till by the interposition of friends the difference could be adjusted  This method of resenting affronts offered to physicians is not new The grave and placid Dr Mead was once provoked to it by Dr Woodward of Gresham college who in the exercise of his profession had said or done something to offend him he went to Woodward's lodgings to demand satisfaction and meeting him under the arch in the way from the outer court to the greencourt drew his sword and bid him defend himself or beg pardon which it is supposed he did This rencounter is recorded in an engraved view of Gresham college inserted in Dr Ward's lives of the Gresham professors in which Woodward is represented kneeling and laying his sword at the feet of his antagonist and was thus explained to me by Dr Lawrence the physician Mead was the friend and patron of Ward which must be supposed to have been his inducement to perpetuate an event so foreign to the nature of his work  By his conduct in this business  Akenside acquired but little reputation for courage for the accommodation was not brought about by any concessions of his adversary but by a resolution from which neither of them would depart for one would not fight in the morning nor the other in the afternoon all that he got by it was the character of an irascible man and many who admired him for his genius and parts were shy of becoming his intimates Yet where there was no competition for applause or literary reputation he was an easy companion and would bear with such rudeness as would have angered almost any one Saxby of the customhouse who was every evening at Tom's and by the bluntness of his behaviour and the many shrewd sayings he was used to utter had acquired the privilege of Thersites of saying whatever he would was once in my hearing inveighing against the profession of physic which Akenside took upon him to defend This railer after labouring to prove that it was all imposture concluded his discourse with this sentiment  'Doctor' said he 'after all you have said my opinion of the profession of physic is this The ancients endeavoured to make it a science and failed and the moderns to make it a trade and have succeeded'  Akenside took this sarcasm in good part and joined in the laugh which it occasioned  The value of that precept which exhorts us to live peaceably with all men or in other words to avoid creating enemies can only be estimated by the reflection on those many amiable qualities against which the neglect of it will preponderate Akenside was a man of religion and strict virtue a philosopher a scholar and a fine poet His conversation was of the most delightful kind learned instructive and without any affectation of wit chearful and entertaining One of the pleasantest days of my life I passed with him Mr Dyson and another friend at Putney bowlinggreen house where a neat and elegant dinner the enlivening sunshine of a summer's day and the view of an unclouded sky were the least of our gratifications In perfect good humour with himself and all around him he seemed to feel a joy that he lived and poured out his gratulations to the great dispenser of all felicity in expressions that Plato himself might have uttered on such an occasion In conversations with select friends and those whose course of study had been nearly the same with his own it was an usual thing with him in libations to the memory of eminent men among the ancients to bring their characters into view and thereby give occasion to expatiate on those particulars of their lives that had rendered them famous his method was to arrange them into three classes philosophers poets and legislators  That a character thus formed should fail of recommending itself to general esteem and procure to the possessor of it those benefits which it is in the power of  mankind to bestow may seem a wonder but it is often seen that negative qualities are more conducive to this end than positive and that with no higher a character than is attainable by any one who with a studious taciturnity will keep his opinions to himself conform to the practice of others and entertain neither friendship for nor enmity against any one a competitor for the good opinion of the world nay for emoluments and even dignities stands a better chance of success than one of the most established reputation for learning and ingenuity The truth of this observation Akenside himself lived to experience who in a competition for the place of physician to the Charterhouse was unable to prevail against an obscure man devoid of every quality that might serve to recommend him and whose sole merit was that of being distantly related to the late lord Holland  To those persons who have been disappointed in their hopes of success in the medical profession may be added one to whom his failure was so far from being a misfortune that it was the means of placing him in a station where only his worth could be known and of exalting him to dignities in which he rendered more service to mankind than he could have done in any other capacity whatever This was Dr Secker the late archbishop of Canterbury of whom I shall relate a few particulars not generally known  We are told by the reverend authors of his life prefixed to his sermons published by them that he had been destined by his father for orders among the dissenters but that not being able to decide on  some abstruse speculative doctrines nor to determine absolutely what communion he should embrace he applied himself to the study of physic To this fact I add that he was also a candidate for practice and that in order to obtain it he put on the garb of a physician and for a year or somewhat more frequented Batson's coffeehouse in the city but had never any calls from thence  Ex relatione Peter Flood the master of the coffeehouse who remembered his coming there  His biographers abovementioned further say that being recommended by Mr afterwards bishop Butler to Mr Edward Talbot a son of bishop Talbot that gentleman promised in case he chose to take orders in the church to engage his father to provide for him and that foreseeing many obstacles in his pursuit of this profession Mr Secker for he had not then obtained the degree of doctor in his faculty embraced the offer They add that in the summer of he was introduced to Mr Talbot and that with him he cultivated a close acquaintance This I conceive was not till after he had made the experiment abovementioned and determined on the change of his profession Mr Talbot's recommendation of his friend to his father succeeded but he lived not to see the fruit of it for in a few months after he was seized with the smallpox and died which last particular agrees with the following communicated to me by a person of unquestionable veracity viz that upon the first appearance of the disorder the symptoms were very unfavourable and it seemed necessary in order to assist the eruption that some person should sleep in the same bed with the patient Mr Secker  voluntarily undertook this office and though it failed of success gave a convincing proof of his gratitude to one whose friendship was likely to prove as it afterwards did the making of his fortunes  To return from this digression the club in Ivy lane composed of the persons above described was a great relief to Johnson after the fatigue of study and he generally came to it with both a corporal and mental appetite for our conversations seldom began till after a supper so very solid and substantial as led us to think that with him it was a dinner By the help of this refection and no other incentive to hilarity than lemonade Johnson was in a short time after our assembling transformed into a new creature his habitual melancholy and lassitude of spirit gave way his countenance brightened his mind was made to expand and his wit to sparkle he told excellent stories and in his didactic stile of conversation both instructed and delighted us  It required however on the part of us who considered ourselves as his disciples some degree of compliance with his political prejudices the greater number of our company were whigs and I was not a tory and we all saw the prudence of avoiding to call the then late adventurer in Scotland or his adherents by those names which others hesitated not to give them or to bring to remembrance what had passed a few years before on Towerhill But the greatest of all our difficulties was to keep alive in Johnson's mind a sense of the decorum due to the age character and profession of Dr Salter whom he took delight in contradicting and bringing his learning  his judgment and sometimes his veracity to the test And here I must observe that Johnson though a highchurchman and by consequence a friend to the clergy as a body of men was with respect to individuals frequently not to say wanting in civility but to a very great degree splenetic and pertinacious For this behaviour we could but one way account He had been bred in an university and must there have had in prospect those advantages those stations in life or perhaps those dignities which an academic education leads to Missing these by his adverse fortunes he looked on every dignitary under a bishop for to those of that order he was more than sufficiently respectful and to descend lower on every one that possessed the emoluments of his profession as occupying a station to which himself had a better title and if his inferior in learning or mental endowments treated him as little better than an usurper  Dr Salter was too much a man of the world to resent this behaviour  'Study to be quiet'  seemed to be his rule and he might possibly think that a victory over Johnson in any matter of dispute could it have been obtained would have been dearly purchased at the price of peace It was nevertheless a temerarious act in him to venture into a society of which such a man was the head Dean Swift in his character of Corusodes  In his essay on the fates of clergymen  has so developed the arts by which mere men of the world attain to ecclesiastical dignities and preferments as should make such for ever cautious how they risque detection and accordingly we see that  many among them are in general backward in forming connections and associating with scholars and the learned of the laity at least with men of Johnson's temper who where he had reason to expect learning never shewed mercy to ignorance  Hawkesworth was a man of fine parts but no learning his reading had been irregular and desultory the knowledge he had acquired he by the help of a good memory retained so that it was ready at every call but on no subject had he ever formed any system All of ethics that he knew he had got from Pope's  'Essay on Man'  and Epistles he had read the modern French writers and more particularly the poets and with the aid of Keill's Introduction Chambers's Dictionary and other such common books had attained such an insight into physics as enabled him to talk on the subject In the more valuable branches of learning he was deficient His office of curator of the Magazine gave him great opportunities of improvement by an extensive correspondence with men of all professions it increased his little stock of literature and furnished him with more than a competent share of that intelligence which is necessary to qualify a man for conversation He had a good share of wit and a vein of humour With all these talents Hawkesworth could be no other than an instructive and entertaining companion  Of a far more valuable kind were the endowments of Dyer keen penetration and deep erudition were the qualities that so distinguished his character that in some instances Johnson might almost be said to have looked up to him As the purpose of our meetings  was the free communication of sentiments and the enjoyment of social intercourse our conversations were unrestrained and the subjects thereof multifarious Dyer was a divine a linguist a mathematician a metaphysician a natural philosopher a classical scholar and a critic this Johnson saw and felt and never but in defence of some fundamental and important truth would he contradict him The deference thus shewn by Johnson to Dyer may be said to have been involuntary or respect extorted for in their religious and political sentiments their disagreement was so great that less of it would in some minds have engendered hatred Of the fundamental and important truths abovementioned there was one namely the nature of moral obligation of which Johnson was uniformly tenacious Every one versed in studies of this kind knows that there are among the moderns three sects or classes of writers on morality who though perhaps deriving their respective tenets from the Socratic the Academic and other ancient schools are in these times considered at least as the guides of sects these are the characteristic lord Shaftesbury Dr Samuel Clarke and Mr Wollaston the first of these makes virtue to consist in a course of action conformable to what is called the moral sense Wollaston says it is acting in all cases according to truth and treating things as they are Dr Clarke supposes all rational agents as under an obligation to act agreeably to the relations that subsist between such or according to what he calls the fitness of things Johnson was ever an admirer of Clarke and agreed with him in this and most other of his opinions excepting in that of the  Trinity in which he said as Dr Bentley though no very sound believer had done before that Dr Waterland had foiled him He therefore fell in with the scheme of fitness and thereby professed himself an adversary in the mildest sense of the word and an opponent of Dyer who having been a pupil of Hutcheson favoured notwithstanding his suspected infidelity this and many other notions and opinions of lord Shaftesbury  To say of lord Shaftesbury that he was but a suspected infidel is surely treating him mildly and I forbear to tax him with unbelief only because in his  'Letters to a student at the University  A young man named Michael Ainsworth the son as I have been informed of the parish clerk of Winborne St Giles in Dorsetshire the seat of the Shaftesbury family whom his lordship sent to and supported at Oxford with a view of settling him in the church and giving to it a divine of his own forming His lordship however failed of his end the young man if not in his religious in his political principles chose to think for himself he might be as good a christian but was not so good a whig as his patron intended him to be he thereby lost his favour and incurred the censure of ingratitude  '  he has affected to speak of the Christian religion as if half persuaded of its truth Nevertheless throughout his works it may be discerned that he omits no opportunity of branding it with superstition and enthusiasm and of representing the primitive professors of it as provoking by their factious and turbulent behaviour those persecutions from whence they derive the glory of martyrs For these sentiments as also for the invidious comparisons he is ever drawing between the  philosophers Plato Epictetus Seneca and others and the fathers and his many contemptuous sneers at the writers on the side of christianity Johnson bore him no good will neither did he seem at all to relish the cant of the Shaftesburian school nor inclined to admit the pretensions of those who professed to be of it to tastes and perceptions which are not common to all men a taste in morals in poetry and prosewriting in painting in sculpture in music in architecture and in government a taste that censured every production and induced them to reprobate every effort of genius that fell short of their own capricious standard  See lord Shaftesbury's  'Letter on Design'  passim in which these fanciful notions prevail that a taste an ear a judgment are the consequences of freedom or civil liberty and that not having attained to the perfection thereof our ecclesiastical structures particularly the metropolitan retain much of what artists call the Gothic kind and compare with it his own puerile devices invented with great labour to illustrate the characteristics    Little as Johnson liked the notions of lord Shaftesbury he still less approved those of some later writers who have pursued the same train of thinking and reasoning namely Hutcheson Dr Nettleton and Mr Harris of Salisbury of which latter for the many singularities of sentiment and style in his  'Hermes'  he scrupled not to speak very lightly There is a book extant intitled  'Letters concerning Mind'  written by a person of the same school named Petvin which with an arrow taken from the quiver of their great master a stroke of ridicule  shot from one of the Idlers Johnson may be fairly said to have transfixed The passage is in a high degree ludicrous and will I am persuaded justify the insertion of it here at length  'The author begins by declaring that  the sorts of things are things that now are have been and shall be and the things that strictly  ARE In this position except the last clause in which he uses something of the scholastic language there is nothing but what every man has heard and imagines himself to know But who would not believe that some wonderful novelty is presented to his intellect when he is afterwards told in the true  bugbear  style that  the  ares  in the former sense are things that lie between the  havebeens  and  shallbees  The  havebeens  are things that are past the  shallbes  are things that are to come and the things that  ARE in the latter sense  are things that have not been nor shall be nor stand in the midst of such as are before them or shall be after them The things that have been and shall be have respect to present past and future Those likewise that now  ARE  have moreover place that for instance which is here that which is to the east that which is to the west  'All this my dear reader is very strange but though it be strange it is not new survey these wonderful sentences again and they will be found to contain nothing more than very plain truths which till this author arose had always been delivered in plain language'  That Dyer should be a friend to the doctrine of the moral sense and to the other tenets of this school is  not to be wondered at seeing that he was a pupil of Hutcheson and that his were the opinions that prevailed at Glasgow where he taught and also at Leyden whither Dyer and many of his fellowstudents in that university removed Akenside and Dyson who were of the number were deep in this scheme and also abettors of that fanciful notion that ridicule is the test of truth  The topics abovementioned were not unfrequently the subjects of altercation between Johnson and Dyer in which it might be observed as Johnson once did of two disputants that the one had ball without powder and the other powder without ball for Dyer though best skilled in the controversy was inferior to his adversary in the power of reasoning and Johnson who was not always master of the question was seldom at a loss for such sophistical arguments as the other was unable to answer  In these disputations I had opportunities of observing what others have taken occasion to remark viz not only that in conversation Johnson made it a rule to talk his best but that on many subjects he was not uniform in his opinions contending as often for victory as for truth at one time  good  at another  evil  was predominant in the moral constitution of the world Upon one occasion he would deplore the nonobservance of GoodFriday and on another deny that among us of the present age there is any decline of public worship He would sometimes contradict selfevident propositions such as that the luxury of this country has increased with its riches and that the practice of cardplaying is more general than heretofore  At this versatility of temper none however took offence as Alexander and Caesar were born for conquest so was Johnson for the office of a symposiarch to preside in all conversations and I never yet saw the man who would venture to contest his right  Let it not however be imagined that the members of this our club met together with the temper of gladiators or that there was wanting among us a disposition to yield to each other in all diversities of opinion and indeed disputation was not as in many associations of this kind the purpose of our meeting nor were our conversations like those of the Rota club restrained to particular topics On the contrary it may be said that with our gravest discourses was intermingled  Mirth that after no repenting draws  MILTON  for not only in Johnson's melancholy there were lucid intervals but he was a great contributor to the mirth of conversation by the many witty sayings he uttered and the many excellent stories which his memory had treasured up and he would on occasion relate so that those are greatly mistaken who infer either from the general tendency of his writings or that appearance of hebetude which marked his countenance when living and is discernible in the pictures and prints of him that he could only reason and discuss dictate and controul  In the talent of humour there hardly ever was his equal except perhaps among the old comedians  such as Tarleton and a few others mentioned by Cibber By means of this he was enabled to give to any relation that required it the graces and aids of expression and to discriminate with the nicest exactness the characters of those whom it concerned In aping this faculty I have seen Warburton disconcerted and when he would fain have been thought a man of pleasantry not a little out of countenance  I have already mentioned that Johnson's motive for the institution of this society was his love of conversation and the necessity he found himself under of seeking relief from the fatigue of compiling his dictionary the same necessity operated still farther and induced him to undertake what most other men would have thought an additional fatigue the publishing a periodical paper The truth is that not having now for a considerable space committed to writing aught but words and their significations his mind was become tumid and laboured to be delivered of those many and great conceptions which for years it had been forming The study of human life and manners had been the chief employment of his thoughts and to a knowledge of these all his reading all his conversation and all his meditations tended By these exercises and the aid of an imagination that was ever teeming with new ideas he accumulated a fund of moral science that was more than sufficient for such an undertaking and became in a very eminent degree qualified for the office of an instructor of mankind in their greatest and most important concerns  I am sensible of the contempt and ridicule with which those authors are treated by lord Shaftesbury who differing from his favourites the ancients have preferred to their method of writing in soliloquy and dialogue the more authoritative and didactic form of essays but who knows not that the ways by which intelligence and wisdom may be communicated are many and various and that Johnson has followed the best exemplars What are the sapiential books in the Scriptures and all collections of precepts and counsels but moral essays lessons of oeconomical prudence and rules for the conduct of human life  In a full persuasion of the utility of this mode of instruction it undoubtedly was that Montaigne lord Bacon Osborne Cowley Sir William Temple and others in those excellent discourses which they have not scrupled to term essays have laid out their minds and communicated to mankind that skill in worldly and I will add in heavenly prudence which is scarcely attainable but by long experience and an exercise both of the active and contemplative life and to disseminate and recommend the principles and practice of religion and virtue as also to correct the lesser foibles in behaviour and to render human intercourse easy and delightful was the avowed design of those periodical essays which in the beginning of this century contributed to form the manners of the then rising generation  A long space had intervened since the publication of the Tatlers Guardians and Spectators it is true it had been filled up by The Lover and The Reader The Theatre The Laymonastery The Plaindealer  The Freethinker The Speculatist The Censor and other productions of the like kind but of some of these it may be said that they were nearly stillborn and of others that they enjoyed a duration little more extended than that of the ephemeron so that Johnson had no competitors for applause his way was open and he had the choice of many paths Add to this that a period of near forty years in a country where commerce and its concomitant luxury had been increasing had given rise to new modes of living and even to characters that had searcely before been known to exist The clergyman was now become an amphibious being that is to say both an ecclesiastic and a laic the stately stalking fop whose gait as Cibber describes it resembled that of a peacock was succeeded by a coxcomb of another species a fidgetting tripping animal that for agility might be compared to a grasshopper the shopkeeper was transformed into a merchant and the parsimonious stockbroker into a man of gallantry the apron the badge of mechanic occupations in all its varieties of stuff and colour was laid aside physicians and lawyers were no longer distinguishable by their garb the former had laid aside the great wig and the latter ceased to wear black except in the actual exercise of their professions in short a few years of public tranquillity had transformed a whole nation into gentlemen  In female life the refinements were also to be noted In consequence of a better education than it had been usual to bestow on them women were become proficients in literature and a man might read a lady's letter without blushing at the spelling The convenience  of turnpikeroads had destroyed the distinction between town and country manners and the maid of honour and the farmer's wife put on a cap of the latest form almost at the same instant I mention this because it may have escaped the observation of many that a new fashion pervades the whole of this our island almost as instantaneously as a spark of fire illuminates a mass of gunpowder  The townlife had also received great improvements which have since been further extended public entertainments are now enjoyed in an immediate succession from the play the company are generally able to get away be eleven the hour of assembling at other places of amusement from these the hour of retirement is three which gives till noon the next day nine hours for rest and after that sufficient time for a ride auctions or shopping before five or six the dinner hour Nor is this seeming indulgence and immoderate pursuit of pleasure so inconsistent with the attendance on public worship as it may seem methodism or something like it in many instances makes them compatible so that I have known a lady of high rank enjoy the pleasures of a rout that almost barred access to her house on the evening of a Sunday which she had begun with prayer and a participation of the solemnities which at an early hour in that day are constantly celebrated at St James's chapel  For most of these refinements on our public diversions we are indebted to the late Mrs Cornelys to whose elegant taste for pleasure the magistrates of Turin and Brussels were so blind and of her worth so insensible that as I was given to understand by intelligence communicated to me in my judicial capacity they severally drove her out of both those cities this hospitable country however afforded her an asylum and in Westminster she was permitted to improve our manners without any further interruption than a presentment of her house as a nuisance by a grand jury of the county which had it been prosecuted it might have been my lot to try but by the aid of her friends she found means to smother it Soon after she became a prisoner for debts to a large amount but in the riots in found means to escape from confinement and has never since been heard of  These it may be said were but foibles in the manners of the times but there were certain notions and opinions which having been disseminated subsequent  to the publication of the last of the collections of essays abovementioned escaped their censure and were now become principles that had misled many and were likely to affect the moral conduct of the young and unthinking these had for their authors and propagators such men as Collins Mandeville  Mandeville whose christian name was Bernard was a native of Dort in Holland He came to England young and as he says in some of his writings was so pleased with the country that he took up his residence in it and made the language his study He lived in obscure lodgings in London and betook himself to the profession of physic but was never able to acquire much practice He was the author of the book abovementioned as also of  'Free Thoughts on Religion'  and  'a Discourse on Hypochondriac Affections'  which Johnson would often commend and wrote besides sundry papers in the  'London Journal'  and other such publications to favour the custom of drinking spirituous liquors to which employment of his pen it is supposed he was hired by the distillers I once heard a London physician who had married the daughter of one of that trade mention him as a good sort of man and one that he was acquainted with and at the same time assert a fact which I suppose he had learned from Mandeville that the children of women addicted to dramdrinking were never troubled with the rickets He is said to have been coarse and overbearing in his manners where he durst be so yet a great flatterer of some vulgar Dutch merchants who allowed him a pension This last information comes from a clerk of a city attorney through whose hands the money passed  Morgan and Tindal the first pair deists and the latter infidels And to these I might add though I would not brand  them with so harsh an appellation as the last Toland Gordon Trenchard and others of that class of writers men who having drank the lees of the Bangorian controversy were become so intoxicated in their notions of civil and religious liberty as to talk of the majesty of the people and shewed themselves anxious that their zeal for religion might be estimated by their jealousy of all establishments for the support of it  The flimsy arguments contained in Collins's discourse on Freethinking had been refuted with great learning and pleasantry by Bentley before which time as I have been informed a clergyman in his habit walking the streets of London was in danger of being affronted but the poison of Mandeville had affected many His favourite principle is the title to the most noted of all his books  'Private vices public benefits'  throughout which he labours to inculcate as a subordinate position this other that man is a selfish being and that all that we call human beneficence is to be accounted for upon principles that exclude the love of any but ourselves  Lord Macclesfield when chiefjustice was used often to have him at his house and was pleased with his conversation He once got Mr Addison to meet him of whom being asked his opinion by his lordship Mandeville answered he thought him a parson in a tyewig See Johnson's life of Addison among the Lives of the Poets    Johnson has remarked that malevolence to the clergy is seldom at a great distance from irreverence for religion He saw the features of that malevolence  in the writings of these men and the point at which freethinking was likely to terminate and taking up the defence of religion where Mr Addison left it he made it a part of his design as well to adduce new arguments for its support and to enforce the practice of virtue as to correct those errors in the smaller concerns and occupations of life the ridiculing which rendered his paper an amusement  In this situation and state of public manners Johnson formed the plan of his Rambler and with what spirit he entered upon it may be inserred from the following solemn address which he composed and offered up to the divine Being for a blessing on the undertaking  'Almighty God the giver of all good things without whose help all labour is ineffectual and without whose grace all wisdom is folly grant I beseech Thee that in this undertaking thy holy spirit may not be withheld from me but that I may promote thy glory and the salvation of myself and others grant this O Lord for the sake of thy son Jesus Christ Amen'  The work was undertaken without the communication of his design to any of his friends and consequently without any desire of assistance from them it was from the stores of his own mind alone that he hoped to be able to furnish that variety of matter which it would require which that it might at no time fail him he kept up by noting in a commonplace book that he carried about him such incidents sentiments and remarks on familiar life and manners as were for his purpose This method of accumulating  intelligence had been practised by Mr Addison and is humourously described in one of the Spectators wherein he feigns to have dropped his paper of Notanda consisting of a diverting medley of broken sentences and loose hints which he tells us he had collected and had meant to make use of Much of the same kind is Johnson's Adversaria as will appear by the following specimens  'HEREDIPETA born heir presumptive to great fortuneHad two

following on writers for bread from whence we learn his genuine sentiments of that profession  ' Quid expedivit Psittacus  'Reasons of writing benevolence desire of fame vanity hunger curiosity to

small place youth of labour old age of dependence This place often not got Gay    Being thus stored with matter Johnson proceeded to publish his paper and the first number came abroad on Tuesday the twentieth day of March  It was the office of a censor of manners to curb the irregularities into which in these new modes of living the youthful of both sexes were apt to fall and this he endeavoured to effect by gentle exhortation by sober reproof and not seldom by the powers of wit and ridicule but with what success others are as well able to tell as myself however if that is to be judged of by the sale of the paper it was doubtless great for though its reception was at first cool and its progress slow the world were too wise to suffer it to sink into oblivion it was collected into volumes and it would be too much for any one to say that ten impressions of twelve hundred and fifty each of a book fraught with the soundest precepts of oeconomical wisdom have been disseminated in vain  On the first publication of the Rambler it met with a few readers who objected to it for certain particularities in the style which they had not been used to in papers of the like kind new and original combinations of words sentences of an unusual form and words derived from other languages though accommodated to the genius of our own but for these such reasons are assigned in the close of the last paper as not only are a defence of them but shew them to be improvements of our language  Of singularity it may be observed that in general it is originality and therefore not a defect and that all is not tumidity which men of little and confined reading please to call so It is from a servile  imitation of others and the use of whole phrases and sentences and customary combinations of words that the variety of styles is not nearly as great as that of faces The vulgar opinion is that the style of this century is the perfection of our language and that we owe its ultimate and final improvement to Mr Addison and when we make his cold and languid periods the test it is no wonder if we mistake strength and animation for tumidity  And here I cannot but remark the error and misfortune of those who are blind to the excellencies of style that occur in the works of many English prose writers of the last century which are rejected for no better a reason than that in them we sometimes meet with words not now in common use A reader ignorant of the state of our language at different periods and not conversant with the writings of ages long past is an incompetent judge of the subject and his opinion of styles of no weight or value Such a one we may suppose hardly restrained from censuring the style of our liturgy compiled for the most part so long ago as the reign of Edward the sixth and the antiquated phrase of the statepapers in the Cabala the Burleigh Sidney and Strafforde collections notwithstanding they severally contain the most perfect models of precatory eloquence and civil negociation  I find an opinion gaining ground not much to the advantage of Mr Addison's style the characteristics whereof are feebleness and inanity I speak of that alone for his sentiments are excellent and his humour exquisite In some instances he adopts vulgar phrase as when he calls an indiscreet action  a piece  of folly and too often uses the expletive adverb  along  thus  Come  along  with me Yet I am not willing to deprive him of the honour implied in Johnson's testimony  'that his prose is the model of the middle style'  but if he be but a mediocrist he is surely not a subject of imitation it being a rule that of examples the best are always to be selected  That Johnson owed his excellence as a writer to the divines and others of the last century myself can attest who have been the witness of his course of reading and heard him declare his sentiments of their works Hooker he admired for his logical precision Sanderson for his accuteness and Taylor for his amazing erudition Sir Thomas Browne for his penetration and Cowley for the ease and unaffected structure of his periods The tinsel of Sprat disgusted him and he could but just endure the smooth verbosity of Tillotson Hammond and Barrow he thought involved and of the latter that he was unnecessarily prolix  It may perhaps be thought as his literary acquaintance was extensive and the toil of compiling his dictionary very great that Johnson was helped in the publication of the Rambler by the communications of others but this was not the fact he forbore to solicit assistance and few presumed to offer it so that in the whole series of those papers we know with certainty of only four that were not of his own writing Of these No was sent him by Mrs Catherine Talbot daughter of Mr Edward Talbot herein before spoken of No by Mr Richardson the author of Clarissa and numbers and by Mrs Elizabeth Carter of Deal a lady to whose reputation for learning  and the most estimable qualities of her sex no praise of mine can make any addition Hence arises that uniformity of subject and sentiment which distinguishes the Rambler from other papers of the like kind but how great must its merit be when wanting the charm of variety and that diversity of characters which by the writers of them was thought necessary to keep attention awake it could support itself to the end and make instruction a substitute for amusement Nor can this defect if it be any be deemed a deviation from Johnson's original purpose which was not so much to instruct young persons of both sexes in the manners of the town as in that more important science the conduct of human life it being certain that he had it in his power as well to delight as to instruct his readers and this he has in some instances done not only by the introduction of fictitious characters and fancied portraits but by ironical sarcasms and original strokes of wit and humour that have perhaps excited more smiles than the writings of many whose chief purpose it was like that of L'Estrange and others to make their readers merry  And hence we may take occasion to observe the error of those who distinguish so widely between men of study and reflection and such as are hackneyed in the ways of the world as to suppose the latter only qualified to instruct us in the offices of life Lord Chesterfield in his letters to his son takes every occasion to express his hatred of an university education to brand it with pedantry and to declare that it unfits a man for social intercourse Some have asserted that travelling is the only means to attain a  knowledge of mankind and the captain in Swift in a less extensive view of human life swears that  To give a young gentleman right education  The army's the very best school in the nation  To say the truth there are numbers of men who contemn all knowledge derived from books and prefer to it what they call turning over the great volume of the world I had once a gardener that could not endure the mention of Miller's dictionary and would contend with me that  'practice was every thing'  and innumerable are the instances of men who oppose motherwit to acquired intelligence and had rather grope their way through the world than be indebted for instruction to the researches of others Such men as these in situations they have not been accustomed to are ever aukward and diffident and it is for a reason nearly akin to this that few rakes are able to look a modest woman in the face On the contrary the attainments of Johnson were such as notwithstanding his homebreeding gave him confidence and qualified him for the conversation of persons of all ranks conditions characters and professions so that no sooner had the Rambler recommended itself to the favour of the public and the author was known to be of easy access than his acquaintance was sought and even courted by persons of whom many with all the improvement of travel and the refinements of courtmanners thought that somewhat worth knowing was to be learned from the conversation of a man whose fortunes and course of life had precluded him from the like advantages  Johnson's talent for criticism both preceptive and corrective is now known and justly celebrated and had he not displayed it in its utmost lustre in his Lives of the Poets we should have lamented that he was so sparing of it in the Rambler which seemed to be a vehicle of all others the most proper for that kind of communication An eulogium on Knolles's History of the Turks and a severe censure of the  'Samson Agonistes'  of Milton are the only critical essays there to be found to the latter he seems to have been prompted by no better a motive than that hatred of the author for his political principles which he is known to have entertained and was ever ready to avow What he has remarked of Milton in his Lives of the Poets is undoubtedly true he was a political enthusiast and as is evident from his panegyric on Cromwell a base and abject flatterer His style in controversy was sarcastic and bitter and not consistent with christian charity and though his apologists endeavour to defend him by the practice of the times there were in his time better examplars than he chose to follow the writings of Jewel Mede Hooker Dr Jackson and others his predecessors in religious and political controversy nor does he seem in his private character to have possessed many of those qualities that most endear men to each other His friends were few Andrew Marvel Marchmont Needham and the younger Vane and Cyriac Skinner Harrington Henry Nevil John Aubrey and others members of that crackbrained assembly the Rotaclub all republicans and there is reason to suspect from the sternness of his temper and the rigid discipline of his  family that his domestic manners were far from amiable and that he was neither a kind husband nor an indulgent parent But neither these nor those other qualities that rendered him both a bitter enemy and a railing disputant could justify the severity of Johnson's criticism on the abovementioned poem nor apologize for that harsh and groundless censure which closes the first of his discourses on it that it is  'a tragedy which ignorance has admired and bigotry applauded'  The reflection on that enmity of Johnson towards Milton which I have above remarked leads me to mention another instance of it which about this time fell under my observation A man of the name of Lauder a native of Scotland and educated in the university of Edinburgh had for reasons that will hereafter be given conceived a hatred against the memory of Milton and formed a scheme to convict him of plagiarism by shewing that he had inserted in the Paradise Lost whole passages taken from the writings of sundry modern Latin poets namely Masenius the jesuit Taubman a German professor the editor of Virgil and joint editor with Gruter of Plautus Staphorstius a Dutch divine and other writers less known and of this crime he attempted to prove him guilty by publishing instances in forged quotations inserted from time to time in the  'Gentleman's Magazine'  which not being detected he made additions to and again published in a volume intitled  'An Essay on Milton's use of and imitation of the moderns in his Paradise Lost dedicated to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge vo '  While the book was in the  press the proof sheets were submitted to the inspection of our club by a member of it who had an interest in its publication and I could all along observe that Johnson seemed to approve not only of the design but of the argument and seemed to exult in a persuasion that the reputation of Milton was likely to suffer by this discovery That he was not privy to the imposture I am well persuaded but that he wished well to the argument must be inferred from the preface which indubitably was written by Johnson  The charges of plagiarism contained in this production Lauder has attempted to make out by citations to a very great number from a Latin poem of Jacobus Masenius a jesuit intitled  'Palaestra ligatae eloquentiae'  from the  'Adamus exul'  of Grotius the  'Triumphus Pacis'  of Caspar Staphorstius a Dutchman from the Latin poems of Caspar Barlaeus and the works of many other writers For a time the world gave credit to them and Milton's reputation was sinking under them till a clergyman of great worth learning and industry Mr now Dr John Douglas prompted at first by mere curiosity set himself to find out and compare the parallel passages in the doing whereof he discovered that in a quotation from Staphorstius Lauder had interpolated eight lines taken from a Latin translation of the Paradise Lost by a man named Hogaeus or Hog and opposed them to the passage in the original as evidence of Milton's plagiarism Proofs of the like fraud in passages cited from Taubman and many others are produced by Dr Douglas but a single instance of the kind would have been sufficient to blast the credit of his adversary  Having made these discoveries Dr Douglas communicated them to the world in a pamphlet intitled  'Milton vindicated from the charge of plagiarism brought against him by Mr Lauder c vo '  Upon the publication thereof his booksellers called on Lauder for a justification of themselves and a confirmation of the charge but he with a degree of impudence not to be exceeded acknowledged the interpolation of the books by him cited and seemed to wonder at  'the folly of mankind in making such a rout about eighteen or twenty lines'  However being a short time after convinced by Johnson and others that it would be more for his interest to make an ample confession of his guilt than to set mankind at defiance and stigmatize them with folly he did so in a letter addressed to Mr Douglas published in quarto beginning thus  'Candour and tenderness are in any relation and on all occasions eminently amiable but when they are found in an adversary and found so prevalent as to overpower that zeal which his cause excites and that heat which naturally increases in the prosecution of argument and which may be in a great measure justified by the love of truth they certainly appear with particular advantages and it is impossible not to envy those who possess the friendship of him whom it is even some degree of good fortuen to have known as an enemy  'I will not so far dissemble my weakness or my fault as not to confess that my wish was to have passed undetected but since it has been my fortune to fail in my original design to have the suppositious  passages which I have inserted in my quotations made known to the world and the shade which began to gather on the splendour of Milton totally dispersed I cannot but count it an allevation of my pain that I have been defeated by a man who knows how to use advantages with so much moderation and can enjoy the honour of conquest withoutthe insolence of triumph  'It was one of the maxims of the Spartans not to press upon a flying army and therefore their enemies were always ready to quit the field because they knew the danger was only in opposing The civility with which you have thought proper to treat me when you had incontestable superiority has inclined me to make your victory complete without any further struggle and not only publicly to acknowledge the truth of the charge which you have hitherto advanced but to confess without the least dissimulation subterfuge or concealment every other interpolation I have made in those authors which youhave not yet had opportunity to examine  'On the sincerity and punctuality of this confession I am willing to depend for all the future regard of mankind and cannot but indulge some hopes that they whom my offence has alienated from me may by this instance of ingenuity and repentance be propitiated and reconciled Whatever be the event I shall at least have done all that can be done in reparation of my former injuries to Milton to truth and to mankind and entreat that those who shall continue implacable will examine their own hearts whether they have not committed equal crimes without equal proofs of sorrow or equal acts of atonement'  Then follow the citations some of which appear to be gratuitous that is to say such as had escaped the detection of the author's adversary  He then proceeds to assign the motive for his attempt to subvert the reputation of Milton in these words  'About ten years ago I published an edition of Dr Johnston's Translation of the Psalms and having procured from the general assembly of the church of Scotland a recommendation of its use to the lower classes of grammarschools into which I had begun to introduce it though not without much controversy and opposition I thought it likely that I should by annual publications improve my little fortune and be enabled to support myself in freedom from the miseries of indigence But Mr Pope in his malevolence to Mr Benson who had distinguished himself by his fondness for the same version destroyed all my hopes by a distich  On two unequal crutches propt he Benson came  Milton's on this on that one Johnston's name  Dunciad book iv line  in which he places Johnston in a contemptuous comparisonwith the author of Paradise Lost  'From this time all my praises of Johnston became ridiculous and I was censured with great freedom for forcing upon the schools an author whom Mr Pope had mentioned only as a foil to a better poet On this occasion it was natural not to be pleased and my resentment seeking to discharge itself somewhere was unhappily directed against  Milton I resolved to attack his fame and found some passages in cursory reading which gave me hopes of stigmatizing him as a plagiary The farther I carried my search the more eager I grew for the discovery and the more my hypothesis was opposed the more I was heated with rage The consequence of my blind passion I need not relate it has by your detection become apparent to mankind Nor do I mention this provocation as adequate to the fury which I have shewn but as a cause of anger less shameful and reproachful than fractious malice personal envy or national jealousy  The concluding paragraph of this confession carries in it such an appearance of contrition that few who red it at the time could withhold that forgiveness which it implores these are the words of it  'For the violation of truth I offer no excuse because I well know that nothing can excuse it Nor will I aggravate my crime by disingenuous palliations I confess it I repent it and resolve that my first offence shall be my last More I cannot perform and more therefore cannot be required I intreat the pardon of all men whom I have by any means induced to support to countenance or patronize any frauds of which I think myself obliged to declare that not one of my friends was conscious I hope to deserve by better conduct and more useful undertakings that patronage which I have obtained from the most illustrious and venerable names by misrepresentation and delusion and to appear hereafter in such a character as shall give  you no reason to regret that your name is frequently mentioned with that of Reverend Sir Your most humble servant WILLIAM LAUDER'  Notwithstanding this humiliating and abject consession which though it was penned by Johnson  Vide infra the account of a subsequent publication of Lauder's  was subscribed by himself Lauder had the impudence in a postscript thereto in effect to retract it by pretending that the design of his essay was only to try how deeply the prepossession in favour of Milton was rooted in the minds of his admirers and that the stratagem as he calls it was intended to impose only on a few obstinate persons and whether that was so criminal as it has been represented he leaves the impartial mind to determine  After the publication of this letter the perusers of it rested in a conviction of the villainy of its author strengthened by the inconsistency between the reasons assigned in that and those in the postscript Nevertheless in the year resolving to attack Milton in another quarter Lauder published a pamphlet intitled  'King Charles I vindicated from the charge of plagiarism brought against him by Milton and Milton himself convicted of forgery and a gross imposition on the public'  The design of this pamphlet was to ingratiate himself with the friends to the memory of Charles by shewing that the prayer of Pamela in Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia was by an artifice os Milton inserted in an edition of the Eikon Basilike with a view to fix on the king a charge of impiety  With this question I meddle not I have only to observe upon Lauder's pamphlet that the argument is introduced by a defence of his essay and an assertion that his letter which he says was written by Johnson in many respects contained not his sentiments and was more properly than an apology an enormous aggravation of his offence and is pursued with a declaration of the author in the sincerity of his heart that had not Milton with such unparalleled malignity blasted the king he would not upon any consideration have either offered a violence to truth put an imposition on the public though but for a moment or attempted to blast Milton's reputation by a falshood  Behold here a reason far differing from each of the two former the first was a provocation given him by a distich of Mr Pope's the second was a desire by a stratagem as he calls it to try how far the partiality of Milton's admirers would lead them and this last is his resentment of an injury done to the memory of king Charles the first If we ask which of these is the true one the answer must be neither for it appears that Lauder had projected an edition of Masenius and other of the Latin poets referred to in his essay and that in order to obtain subscriptions for the same he had been guilty of the wickedness imputed to and proved upon him  The concluding paragraph of this last pamphlet of Lauder as it is for its impudence matchless I here give and in the doing thereof consign his memory to that insamy which by his complicated wickedness he has incurred  'As for his Milton's plagiarisms I intend shortly God willing to extract such genuine proofs from those authors who held forth the lighted torch to Milton I mean who illustrated the subject of the Paradise Lost long before that prince of plagiaries entered upon it as may be deemed sufficient not only to replace the few interpolations for which I have been so hideously exclaimed against but even to reinforce the charge of plagiarism against the English poet and fix it upon him by irrefragable conviction in the face of the whole world and by the suffrage of all candid and impartial judges while sun and moon shall endure to the everlasting shame and confusion of the whole idolatrous rabble of his numerous partizans particularly my vainglorious adversary who will reap only the goodly harvest of disappointment and disgrace where he expected to gather laurels'  In Dr Douglas published a new edition of his pamphlet with the title of  'Milton no plagiary or a detection of the forgeries contained in Lauder's essay on the imitations of the moderns in the Paradise Lost'  to this is an appendix containing part of an apology of Lauder's booksellers for having been the publishers of his essay in which they give an account of their conduct after the first discovery of his villainy in the following words  'An immediate application to Lauder was necessary as well to justify ourselves as to remove or confirm the charge Accordingly we acquainted him that if he did not instantly put into our hands the books from which he had taken the principal passages we would publicly disclaim  all connexion with him and expose his declining the only step left for his defence This declaration brought him to us the following day when with great confidence he acknowledged the interpolation of all the books and seemed to wonder at mankind in making such a rout about eighteen or twenty lines As this man then has been guilty of such a wicked imposition upon us our friends and the public and is capable of so daring an avowal of it we declare that we will have no farther intercourse with him and that we now sell his book only as a curiosity of fraud and interpolation which all the ages of literature cannot parallel'  With a character thus blasted it was next to impossible for this man to continue in England he therefore left it and went to settle at Barbadoes proposing to set up a school there but upon his arrival on the island he met with small encouragement and is said to have died about the year  As Johnson though not in the least an accessary to the imposture above related had a considerable share in the controversy that it gave rise to it seemed to me necessary to be thus particular in giving such an account thereof as would concentrate into one point all that was written on the subject and convey to posterity the history of a transaction the like whereof is not to be found among the records of literature It is too sad a truth that learning and rectitude of mind are qualities independent of each other and that the world has in all ages abounded with examples of men of great erudition who have been wanting in common honesty We read of men who have corrupted  the Holy Scriptures with a view to favour a particular heresy and of monks who have forged charters to promote the secular interests of their fraternity these though wicked actions must be supposed to have sprung from a principle which having for its object a common benefit had somewhat of generosity in it but the motives of this impostor were all of the selfish kind revenge for a supposed injury done to himself and an impatience to be relieved from his own peculiar and personal wants and distresses and though it was for some time thought that his confession had atoned for his offence we find it was in fact an aggravation of it In as much as it was not sincere it was a repentance to be repented of and indeed in one sense he seems to have thought so for in his last publication he retracts it and that nothing might be wanting to fill up the measure of his iniquity he defies his detector whose endeavours were to beget in him that sense of shame which as it is ever the forerunner of penitence has ever been deemed salutary  Great thanks are due to this learned divine and eminent scholar for the zeal and industry manifested by him in the course of this singular controversy and every judicious reader must rejoice that through his means our great poet has been rescued from an infamous charge and that we may yet read the  'Paradise Lost'  without a suspicion of its originality  To return to Johnson I have already said that he paid no regard to time or the stated hours of refection or even rest and of this his inattention I will here relate a notable instance Mrs Lenox a lady now well known  in the literary world had written a novel intitled  'The life of Harriot Stuart'  which in the spring of was ready for publication One evening at the club Johnson proposed to us the celebrating the birth of Mrs Lenox's first literary child as he called her book by a whole night spent in festivity Upon his mentioning it to me I told him I had never sat up a whole night in my life but he continuing to press me and saying that I should find great delight in it I as did all the rest of our company consented The place appointed was the Devil tavern and there about the hour of eight Mrs Lenox and her husband and a lady of her acquaintance now living as also the club and friends to the number of near twenty assembled Our supper was elegant and Johnson had directed that a magnificent hot applepye should make a part of it and this he would have stuck with bayleaves because forsooth Mrs Lenox was an authoress and had written verses and further he had prepared for her a crown of laurel with which but not till he had invoked the muses by some ceremonies of his own invention he encircled her brows The night passed as must be imagined in pleasant conversation and harmless mirth intermingled at different periods with the refreshments of coffee and tea About five Johnson's face shone with meridian splendour though his drink had been only lemonade but the far greater part of us had deserted the colours of Bacchus and were with difficulty rallied to partake of a second refreshment of coffee which was scarcely ended when the day began to dawn This phenomenon began to put us in mind of our reckoning  but the waiters were all so overcome with sleep that it was two hours before we could get a bill and it was not till near eight that the creaking of the streetdoor gave the signal for our departure  My mirth had been considerably abated by a severe fit of the toothach which had troubled me the greater part of the night and which Bathurst endeavoured to alleviate by all the topical remedies and palliatives he could think of and I well remember at the instant of my going out of the taverndoor the sensation of shame that affected me occasioned not by reflection on any thing evil that had passed in the course of the night's entertainment but on the resemblance it bore to a debauch However a few turns in the Temple and a breakfast at a neighbouring coffeehouse enabled me to overcome it  In the foregoing pages I have assigned the motives that induced Johnson to the institution of the club and the writing of the Rambler and here I may add that his view in both was so far answered as that the amusements they afforded him contributed not only to relieve him from the fatigue of his great work the dictionary but that they served to divert that melancholy which the public now too well knows was the disease of his mind For this morbid affection as he was used to call it no cause can be assigned nor will it gratify curiosity to say it was constituional or that it discovered itself in his early youth and haunted him in his hours of recreation and it is but a surmise that it might be a latent concomitant of that disease which in his infancy had induced his mother to seek relief from the royal touch His  own conjecture was that he derived it from his father of whom he was used to speak as of a man in whose temper and character melancholy was predominant Under this persuasion he at the age of about twenty drew up a state of his case for the opinion of an eminent physician in Staffordshire and from him received an answer  'that from the symptoms therein described he could think nothing better of his disorder than that it had a tendency to insanity and without great care might possibly terminate in the deprivation of his rational faculties'  The dread of so great a calamity was one inducement with him to abstain from wine at certain periods of his life when his fears in this respect were greatest but it was not without some reluctance that he did it for he has often been heard to declare that wine was to him so great a cordial that it required all his resolution to resist the temptations to ebriety  It was fortunate for the public that during a period of two years the depression of his mind was at no time so great as to incapacitate him for sending forth a number of the Rambler on the days on which it became due nor did any of the essays or discourses therein contained either in the choice of subjects or the manner of treating them indicate the least symptom of drooping faculties or lassitude of spirit Nevertheless whether the constant meditation on such topics as most frequently occur therein had not produced in his mind a train of ideas that were now become uneasy to him or whether that intenseness of thought which he must have exerted first in the conception and next in the delivery of such  original and noble sentiments as these papers abound with had not made the relaxation of his mind necessary he thought proper to discontinue the Rambler at a time when its reputation was but in its dawn  The paper in which this his resolution is announced is that of March which concludes the work As he had given his readers no warning of his intention they were unprepared for the shock and had the mortification to receive the tidings and the blow at the same instant with the aggravation of a sympathetic melancholy excited by the mournful expressions with which he takes his leave And though he affects to think the reasons for discontinuing the publication a secret to his readers it is but too apparent that it was written in the hours of dejection and that the want of assistance and encouragement was not the weakest of his motives Of the former of these two he had surely no right to complain for he was so far from being ever known to wish for assistance that his most intimate friends seemed to think it would have been presumption to offer it The want of encouragement indeed might be a justifiable cause of discontent for I have reason to think that the number of papers taken off hardly amounted to five hundred on any of the days of publication Nevertheless the slow circulation of the paper was to be accounted for by other reasons than that the author was never a favourite with the public a reflection that would have been but excusable had his imitations of Juvenal become waste paper or his Irene instead of being suffered to run nine nights been consigned to oblivion on the first  for it must be considered that the merits of the Rambler were of a kind not likely to recommend it to those who read chiefly for amusement and of readers this class will ever be by much the most numerous the subjects therein discussed are chiefly the weightiest and most important respecting more our eternal than temporal happiness and that these were the obstacles to the progress of his paper himself has unawares confessed in his apology for the conduct of it  'I have never' says he 'complied with temporary curiosity nor enabled my readers to discuss the topic of the day I have rarely exemplified my assertions by living characters in my papers no man could look for censures of his enemies or praises of himself and they only were expected to peruse them whose passions left them leisure for abstracted truth and whom virtue could please by its naked dignity'  Towards the close of this last paper he seems to refer to  'the final sentence of mankind'  with a sort of presage that one more deliberate than that to which he was submitting might be more favourable to his labours He little thought at this time to what length the justice of mankind would go that he should be a witness to the publication of the tenth edition of the Rambler or that his heart would ever be dilated as his friends can testify it was with the news of its being translated into the Russian language  Much might be said in commendation of this excellent work but such suffrages as those here mentioned set it almost above praise In the author's own  opinion it was less estimable than in that of his judges some merit indeed he claims for having enriched his native language but in terms so very elegant and modest that they at once hold forth an exemplar and convey an apology  'I have laboured' says he 'to refine our language to grammar and purity and to clear it from colloquial barbarisms licentious idioms and irregular combinations Something perhaps I have added to the elegance of its construction and something to the harmony of its cadence When common words were less pleasing to the ear or less distinct in their signification I have familiarized the terms of philosophy by applying them to popular ideas but have rarely admitted any word not authorized by former writers'  With what success these endeavours of his have been attended is best known to those who have made eloquence their study and it may go far towards the stamping a lasting character of purity elegance and strength on the style of Johnson to say that some of the most popular orators of this country now living have not only proposed it to themselves as a model for speaking but for the purpose of acquiring the cadence and flow of his periods have actually gotten whole essays from the Rambler by heart  The concluding paragraph of his farewel paper is so very awful that I cannot resist the temptation to insert it and the rather for that it seems to have been written under a persuasion that Almighty God had been propitious to his labour and that the solemn address to him which he had composed and offered up on occasion of his engaging in it had been heard and was likely to be accepted  'The essays professedly serious if I have been able to execute my own intentions will be found exactly conformable to the precepts of Christianity without any accommodation to the licentiousness and levity of the present age I therefore look back on this part of my work with pleasure which no praise of man shall diminish or augment I shall never envy the honours which wit and learning obtain in any other cause if I can be numbered among the writers who have given ardour to virtue and confidence to truth  Celestial pow'rs that piety regard  From you my labours wait their last reward  The Rambler thus published in numbers was not suffered to be lost to the world or to sink into oblivion As soon as by the conclusion of it it became a complete work it was collected into volumes and printed in Scotland  In this edition a translation of the mettos by Mr Elphinston is given  and soon after also here and obtained such favour with the public as was an inducement with Dr Hawkesworth to an undertaking of the same kind the publication of a periodical paper called  'The Adventurer'  For the carrying on such a work as this Hawkesworth though he possessed but a small stock of learning was more than meanly qualified He had excellent natural parts and by reading the modern English and French authors had acquired a style which by his acquaintance with Johnson he had improved into a very good one He wrote verses that is to say in English with ease  and fluency and was better acquainted with the world than most men are who have been bred to no profession  The subjects of these papers like those of the Rambler are human life and manners with a mixture of humour and instructive pleasantry criticism and moral and religious exhortation too various it must be supposed for the powers of a single person they are therefore the produce of different pens and may owe their merit in a great measure to that diversity The curiosity of the reader is to a small degree gratified by the last paper which assigns to their author Dr Joseph Warton such as have a certain signature and leaves to Dr Hawkesworth himself the praise of such as are without any To the information there given I add that the papers marked A which are said to have come from a source that soon failed were supplied by Dr Bathurst an original associate in the work and those distinguished by the letter T by Johnson  That Johnson was the writer of the papers signed T I assert on the authority of his Adversaria in which are the original hints of many of them in his own handwriting    The first number of the Adventurer made its appearance on Tuesday November and on that weekday and also on Saturdays it continued to be published till the ninth of March To point out the many excellent essays contained in it is needless as they are now collected into volumes and together with the Rambler form a system of moral and oeconomical institution two of them are to be looked on as curiosities in different ways Dr Warton's remarks on  'King Lear'  and  'the Tempest'  the most  learned and judicious critiques in the English language and the account of a native of Scotland called Admirable Crichton dictated from memory by Johnson to Hawkesworth  As Johnson expected to be believed whenever he either spoke or wrote he has not vouchsafed to cite any authority for the incredible relation which the Adventurer contains of the personal and mental endowments of a man who is described as a monster both of erudition and prowess and in every other view of his character is represented as having passed the limits of humanity That he had no authority for what he has related of him would be too much to say after he has asserted that he had such as was incontestible yet having that he has kept within the bounds of it and cast a veil over that blaze of glory which to gaze on in its naked splendour would not dazzle but blind the beholder  Johnson's account for his I must call it for a reason above given is in these words  'Among the favourites of nature that have from time to time appeared in the world enriched with various endowments and contrarieties of excellence none seems to have been more exalted above the common rate of humanity than the man known about two centuries ago by the appellation of the Admirable Crichton of whose history whatever we may suppress as surpassing credibility yet we shall upon incontestable authority relate enough to rank him among prodigies  "Virtus" says Virgil "is better accepted when it comes in a pleasing form"  the person of Crichton was eminently beautiful but his beauty was  consistent with such activity and strength that in fencing he would spring at one bound the length of twenty feet upon his antagonist and he used his sword in either hand with such force and dexterity that scarce any one had courage to engage him  'Having studied at St Andrew's in Scotland he went to Paris in his twentyfirst year and affixed on the gate of the college of Navarre a kind of challenge to the learned of that university to dispute with him on a certain day offering to his opponents whoever they should be the choice of ten languages and of all the faculties and sciences On the day appointed three thousand auditors assembled when four doctors of the church and fifty masters appeared against him and one of his antagonists confesses that the doctors were defeated that he gave proofs of knowledge above the reach of man and that a hundred years passed without food or sleep would not be sufficient for the attainment of his learning After a disputation of nine hours he was presented by the president and professors with a diamond and a purse of gold and dismissed with repeated acclamations  'From Paris he went away to Rome where he made the same challenge and had in the presence of the pope and cardinals the same success Afterwards he contracted at Venice an acquaintance with Aldus Manutius by whom he was introduced to the learned of that city then visited Padua where he engaged in another public disputation beginning  his performance with an extemporal poem in praise of the city and the assembly then present and concluding with an oration equally unpremeditated in commendation of ignorance  'He afterwards published another challenge in which he declared himself ready to detect the errors of Aristotle and all his commentators either in the common forms of logic or in any which his antagonists should propose of a hundred different kinds of verse  'These acquisitions of learning however stupendous were not gained at the expence of any pleasure which youth generally indulges or by the omission of any accomplishment in which it becomes a gentleman to excel he practised in great perfection the arts of drawing and painting he was an eminent performer in both vocal and instrumental music he danced with uncommon gracefulness and on the day after his disputation at Paris exhibited his skill in horsemanship before the court of France where at a public match of tilting he bore away the ring upon his lance fifteen times together  'He excelled likewise in domestic games of less dignity and reputation and in the interval between his challenge and disputation at Paris he spent so much of his time at cards dice and tennis that a lampoon was fixed upon the gate of the Sorbonne directing those that would see this monster of erudition to look for him at the tavern  'So extensive was his acquaintance with life and manners that in an Italian comedy composed by  himself and exhibited before the court of Mantua he is said to have personated fifteen different characters in all which he might succeed without great difficulty since he had such power of retention that once hearing an oration of an hour he would repeat it exactly and in the recital follow the speaker through all his variety of tone and gesticulation  'Nor was his skill in arms less than in learning or his courage inferior to his skill there was a prizefighter in Mantua who travelling about the world according to the barbarous custom of that age as a general challenger had defeated the most celebrated masters in many parts of Europe and in Mantua where he then resided had killed three that appeared against him The duke repented that he had granted him his protection when Crichton looking on his sanguinary success with indignation offered to stake fifteen hundred pistoles and mount the stage against him The duke with some reluctance consented and on the day fixed the combatants appeared their weapons seem to have been single rapier which was then newly introduced in Italy The prizefighter advanced with great violence and fierceness and Crichton contented himself calmly to ward his passes and suffered him to exhaust his vigour by his own fury Crichton then became the assailant and pressed upon him with such force and agility that he thrust him thrice through the body and saw him expire he then divided the prize he had won among the widows whose husbands had been killed  'The death of this wonderful man I should be willing to conceal did I not know that every reader will enquire curiously after that fatal hour which is common to all human beings however distinguished from each other by nature or by fortune  'The duke of Mantua having received so many proofs of his various merit made him tutor to his son Vincentio di Gonzaga a prince of loose manners and turbulent disposition On this occasion it was that he composed the comedy in which he exhibited so many different characters with exact propriety But his honour was of short continuance for as he was one night in the time of Carnival rambling about the streets with his guitar in his hand he was attacked by six men masked Neither his courage nor skill in this exigence deserted him he opposed them with such activity and spirit that he soon dispersed them and disarmed their leader who throwing off his mask discovered himself to be the prince his pupil Crichton falling on his knees took his own sword by the point and presented it to the prince who immediately seized it and instigated as some say by jealousy according to others only by drunken fury and brutal resentment thrust him through the heart  'Thus was the Admirable Crichton brought into that state in which he could excel the meanest of mankind only by a few empty honours paid to his memory the court of Mantua testified their esteem by a public mourning the contemporary wits were profuse of their encomiums and the  palaces of Italy were adorned with pictures representing him on horseback with a lance in one hand and a book in the other'  The above account is so defective in the evidences of historical verity that it has been by some suspected to be fabulous It is true that in essays of such a kind as that which contains this eulogium it is not usual for that would be to incur the charge of pedantry to cite authorities nevertheless the circumstances of time and place seem so necessary in the relation of every uncommon event and in the description of every extraordinary person that the omission of both in this instance as also the christian name of the person celebrated can hardly be excused  To supply these defects I might refer the reader to authorities that fix the place of his birth at Clunie in the shire of Perth in Scotland the year thereof at and that of his death and that tell us also that Crichton's name of baptism was James and as to the facts enumerated in the Adventurer they seem to be sufficiently authenticated to all the purposes of historical information in a book written in by Sir Thomas Urquhart  This singular person whose name is sometimes written Urchard was a physician of the house of Cromarty in Scotland a man of learning and the first translator into English of the works of Rabelais In the time of the rebellion in Scotland Temp Car he was a fierce opponent of the presbyterian establishment and taking as we may suppose an active part against it was made a prisoner of war and though enlarged on his parole endured many hardships Besides the book abovementioned he wrote sundry tracts which have lately been collected and published in one volume octavo one whereof is intitled  'The true pedigree and lineal descent of the most ancient and honourable family of Urquhart in the house of Cromarty from the creation of the world till the year '  in which we are not more astonished to meet with a long succession of names for the most part purely Greek than to find such minute particulars recorded as neither history nor tradition was ever before known to obtrude upon posterity  For instance speaking of one of his ancestors named Esormun who he says lived AM and married Narfesia he tells this most incredible tale  'He was sovereign prince of Achaia For his fortune in the wars and affability in conversation his subjects and familiars surnamed him  that is fortunate and wellbeloved After which time his posterity ever since hath acknowledged him the father of all that carry the name of URQUHART He had for his arms three banners three ships and three ladies in a field  Or  with the picture of a young lady above the waist holding in her right hand a brandished sword and a branch of myrtle in her left for the crest and for supporters two javanetes after the soldier habit of Achaia with this motto in the scrole of his coatarmour  that is these three are worthy to behold Upon his wife Narfesia who was sovereign of the Amazons he begot Cratynter'  Of Litoborus another pretended ancestor of the Urquhart family who lived AM he says he married two wives Pasena and Emphaneola and adds  'yet had he besides these two ladies several others both wives and concubines as the fashion was over the whole world for the space of above a thousand years thereafter'  And of Phrenedon another who lived about sixty years after he roundly asserts  'that he was in the house of the patriarch Abraham at the time of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah'  bearing this  strange title  'ΕΚΣΚΥΒΑΛΑΥΡΟΝ or the discovery of a most exquisite jewel more precious than diamonds inchased in gold the like whereof was never seen in any age found in the kennel of Worcesterstreets the day after the fight and six before the autumnal equinox '  In this book is contained a memorial of sundry illustrious persons of Scotland serving to vindicate the honour of that nation but written in such a style of learned tumidity and bombast as is not to be paralleled in any book now extant I here cite from it two passages respecting Crichton as specimens thereof and as proofs of Johnson's discretion in veiling the effulgence of a character too bright to be viewed in its genuine lustre  'It happening on a ShroveTuesday at night that this everrenowned  Crichtoun  who in the afternoon  of that day at the desire of my lord duke the whole court striving which should exceed other in foolery and devising of the best sports to

moved he held it going with another new device upon the back of the first and another yet another and another againe succeeding one another for the promoval of what is a stirring into a higher

formerly part of the furniture of a barber's shop and was the amusement of waiting customers See Gen Hist of the Science and Practice of Music Vol III page  and his gloves hanging by a button at his girdle  'Those fifteen several personages he did represent with such excellency of garb and exquisiteness of language that condignely to perpend the subtlety of the invention the method of the disposition the neatness of the elocution the gracefulness of the action and wonderful variety in the so dextrous performance of all you would have taken it for a comedy of five acts consisting of

sorts of men whose carriages he did personate into an inestimable  Ollapodrida  of immaterial morsels of divers kinds futable to the very Ambrosian relish of the Heliconian Nymphs that in the  Peripetia  of this Drammatical exercitation by the inchanted transportation of the eyes and eares of its spectabundal auditorie one would have sworne that they all had looked with multiplying glasses and that like that Angel in the Scripture whose voice was said to be like the voice of a multitude they heard in him alone the promiscuous speech of fifteen several actors by the various ravishments of the excellencies whereof in the frolickness of a jocund straine beyond expectation the logofascinated spirits of the beholding hearers and auricularie spectators were so on a sudden seazed upon in their risible faculties of the soul and all their vital motions so universally affected in this extremitie of agitation that to avoid the inevitable charmes of his intoxicating ejaculations and the accumulative influences of so powerfull a transportation one of my lady Dutchess chief Maids of Honour by the vehemencie of the shock of those incomprehensible raptures burst forth into a laughter to the rupture of a veine in her body and another young lady by the irresistible violence of the pleasure unawares infused where the tender receptibilitie of her too too tickled fancie was least able to hold out so unprovidedly was surprised that with no less impetuositie of ridibundal passion then as hath been told occasioned a fracture in the other young ladie modestie she not able longer to support the wellbeloved burthen of so excessive delight and intransing joys of such Mercurial exhilarations through the ineffable extasie of  an overmastered apprehension fell back in a swown without the appearance of any other life into her then what by the most refined wits of theological speculators is conceived to be exerced by the purest parts of the separated  entelechies  of blessed saints in their sublimest conversations with the celestial hierarchies this accident procured the incoming of an apothecarie with restoratives as the other did that of a surgeon with consolidative medicaments'  Speaking of the manner of Crichton's death and that it followed from a thrust with his own sword by the hand of the prince son of the duke of Mantua the author says  'The whole court wore mourning for him full three quarters of a yeer together his funeral was very stately and on his hearse were stuck more Epitaphs Elegies Threnodies and Epicediums then if digested into one book

Bembo  had been purposely resuscitated to stretch even to the utmost their poetick vein to the honour of this brave man whose picture till this hour is to be seen in the bedchambers or galleries of the most of the great men of that nation representing him on horseback with a lance in one hand and a book in the other and  most of the young ladies likewise that were any thing handsome in a memorial of his worth had his effigies in a little oval tablet of gold hanging 'twixt their breasts and held for many yeers together that  Metamazion  or intermammilary ornament an as necessary outward pendicle for the better setting forth of their accoutrements as either  Fan Watch  or  Stomacher  '  The several exploits of Crichton aboverelated as they appear upon the face of Sir Thomas Urquhart's book are it must be confessed unsupported by any citations from history or the writings of contemporary biographers or other narrators of remarkable transactions and may therefore in the judgment of those who reflect on the hyperbolical style of the author and the extravagancies to which such an enthusiastic spirit as his will lead men stand in need of still farther proof Happily since the publication of the Adventurer such evidence has been laid before the public as must remove all doubt of the existence of such a person as Crichton and of the truth of the facts aboverelated of him  For this information we are indebted to Mr Pennant who in his tour to Scotland vol I page confirms the account of Sir Thomas Urquhart in all its particulars vouching as his authority Aldus Manutius Joannes Imperialis a physician of Vicenza and a writer whom I take to be Estienne Pasquier two of whom were personally acquainted with him and eyewitnesses to the triumphs by them severally recorded From Aldus Manutius we learn that Crichton was a scholar of Buchanan  Mr Pennant has further obliged the public with some Latin verses of Crichton's writing and an engraving of him from an original portrait  From all which testimonies it is but a necessary conclusion that whatever may be suppressed as passing credibility of the person here celebrated enough is upon incontestable authority related to induce us to rank him among prodigies  That Johnson dictated this number of the Adventurer I have already said that he did not himself write it may be thus accounted for he had doubtless red the history of Crichton in Sir Thomas Urquhart's book and retained it with that firmness of memory which held fast almost every thing that he met with in books Supposing him as we may too indolent to recur to one that he had formerly red through and in the hearing of Hawkesworth to have related the transactions of so wonderful a man the latter might catch at it as a fit subject for an essay and give it to the world as he has done in the Adventurer To which we may add that Johnson was seldom a narrator of events his talent was original thinking in conversation he told stories and related historical facts with great precision but rarely sent them abroad in writing  We are not to suppose that that soreness of mind which Johnson seems to have felt at the time of his discontinuing the Rambler was in the short interval of six months so completely healed as to render him a disinterested candidate for praise in this new publication or that he who had declared that he could not compose a sermon gratis would write an Adventurer without being hired to it on the contrary it  is certain that he retained his old maxim that gain was the only genuine stimulative to literary exertion and that the assistance he gave to this publication was purchased at two guineas for every number that he had finished a rate of payment which he had before adjusted in his stipulation for the Rambler and was probably the measure of a reward to his fellowlabourers  The avowed end of the Adventurer being the same with that of the Rambler and the plan and conduct thereof so little different from it the latter may be considered as a continuation of the former nevertheless it may be observed that in the Adventurer the number of entertaining papers of portraits singular characters and essays of wit humour and pleasantry is greater in proportion than in the Rambler and to that diversity it was doubtless owing that the circulation of it was more diffuse On the part of the writers it was carried on with great vigour and together with the Rambler is likely to remain a lasting evidence of the spirit that dictated and the public good sense that encouraged such a series as they both contain of religious instruction oeconomical wisdom and innocent delight  Hawkesworth has almost in terms declared himself the editor of the Adventurer and that the other contributors thereto were merely auxiliaries and his zeal for its success may be inferred from the number of papers written by himself which upon a comparison will be found nearly equal to that of all the rest This zeal was excited by a motive far more strong than any which actuated his coadjutors a desire of advantage in his then profession which ostensibly was  that of a governor of a school for the education of young females by making himself known as a judge of life and manners and capable of qualifying those of riper years for the important relations of domestic society  But while he was indulging a wellgrounded hope to reap this fruit of his studies a reward of a very different kind courted his acceptance The archbishop of Canterbury Dr Herring his diocesan and neighbour having perused his essays and informed himself of his general character made him an offer of a faculty that should raise him above the level of vulgar literati and almost without his being conscious of any such exaltation create him a doctor of both laws and the honour was accepted  Among men of real learning there is but one opinion concerning what are called Lambeth degrees The right of conferring them is a relic of the power anciently exercised in this country by the legates of the pope and is by statute transferred to the archbishop of Canterbury It received a legal sanction in the determination about the year of the case of the warden of Manchester college Degrees of this kind are often convenient for clergymen as they are qualifications for a plurality of livings but as they imply nothing more than favour convey little or no honour  But Hawkesworth was so far mistaken in his notion of this act of kindness of the archbishop that though he had never red Justinian nor perhaps ever seen the Corpus Juris Civilis or Corpus Juris Canonici he conceived himself transmuted by it into a civilian and a canonist and qualified for an advocate in either of those judicatures where the above laws are severally recognised  In consequence of this persuasion he made an effort to be admitted a pleader in the courts of ecclesiastical jurisdiction but met with such an opposition as obliged him to desist Upon this he bent his course another way and recurring to his first design of converting his school into a kind of female academy succeeded not more to his own emolument than the improvement of those who participated in the benefits of his tuition  In this train of events and others that are well enough known it may be discerned that Hawkesworth was a greater gainer by the Adventurer than any of those concerned in it His success however wrought no good effects upon his mind and conduct it elated him too much and betrayed him into a forgetfulness of his origin and a neglect of his early acquaintance and on this I have heard Johnson remark in terms that sufficiently expressed a knowledge of his character and a resentment of his behaviour It is probable that he might use the same language to Hawkesworth himself and also reproach him with the acceptance of an academical honour to which he could have no pretensions and which Johnson conceiving to be irregular as many yet do held in great contempt thus much is certain that soon after the attainment of it the intimacy between them ceased  The expedients abovementioned and the visits of a variety of friends which his writings had procured him afforded Johnson great relief and enabled him to keep at a bay those terrors which were almost incessantly assailing him till the beginning of the year OS when it pleased God to try him by a calamity which was very near realizing all those evils  which for a series of years he had dreaded this was the loss of his wife who on the th day of March and after seventeen years cohabitation left him a childless widower abandoned to sorrow and incapable of consolation  Those who were best acquainted with them both wondered that Johnson could derive no comfort from the usual resources reflections on the conditions of mortality the instability of human happiness resignation to the divine will and other topics and the more when they considered that their marriage was not one of those which inconsiderate young people call lovematches and that she was more than old enough to be his mother that as their union had not been productive of children the medium of a new relation between them was wanting that her inattention to some at least of the duties of a wife were evident in the person of her husband whose negligence of dress seemed never to have received the least correction from her and who in the sordidness of his apparel and the complexion of his linen even shamed her For these reasons I have often been inclined to think that if this fondness of Johnson for his wife was not dissembled it was a lesson that he had learned by rote and that when he practised it he knew not where to stop till he became ridiculous It is true he has celebrated her person in the word formosae which he caused to be inscribed on her gravestone but could he with that imperfection in his sight which made him say in the words of Milton he never saw the human face divine have been a witness of her beauty which we may suppose  had sustained some loss before he married her daughter by her former husband being but little younger than Johnson himself As during her lifetime he invited but few of his friends to his house I never saw her but I have been told by Mr Garrick Dr Hawkesworth and others that there was somewhat crazy in the behaviour of them both profound respect on his part and the airs of an antiquated beauty on her's Johnson had not then been used to the company of women and nothing but his conversation rendered him tolerable among them it was therefore necessary that he should practice his best manners to one whom as she was descended from an ancient family and had brought him a fortune he thought his superior This after all must be said that he laboured to raise his opinion of her to the highest by inserting in many of her books of devotion that I have seen such endearing memorials as these  'This was dear Tetty's book''This was a prayer which dear Tetty was accustomed to say'  not to mention his frequent recollection of her in his meditations and the singularity of his prayers respecting her  To so high a pitch had he worked his remembrance of her that he requested a divine of his acquaintance to preach a sermon at her interment which probably he would have written himself but was dissuaded from so ostentatious a display of the virtues of a woman who though she was his wife was but little known He intended also to have deposited her remains in the chapel in Tothill fields Westminster but altering his mind he committed the disposal of them to his friend  Hawkesworth who buried her in his own parishchurch of Bromley in Kent under a black marble stone on which Johnson himself a few months before his death caused the following memorial to be inscribed  Hic conduntur reliquiae  ELIZABETHAE  Antiqua Jarvisiorum gente  Peatlingae apud Leicestrienses ortae  Formosae cultae ingeniosae piae  Uxoris primis nuptiis HENRICI PORTER  Secundis SAMUELIS JOHNSON  Qui multum amatam diuque defletam  Hoc lapide contexit  Obiit Londini mense Mart  AD MDCCLIII  I have been informed that in his early youth he entertained a romantic passion excited possibly by reading the poets for a young woman of a family and in circumstances far above him but proofs are wanting that Johnson was at any period of his life susceptible of amorous emotions In his intercourse with the world he had become known to many of the female sex who sought his conversation  Posterity will wonder to be told that a celebrated courtezan Kitty Fisher was of the number and that possibly having heard of the attempt of Laïs on Demosthenes she once left her card at his house  but it was never heard that he entertained a passion for any one or was in any other sense a lover than as he was the author of amorous  verses If ever he was in danger of becoming one in reality it was of a young woman whom he used to call Molly Aston of whose wit and of the delight he enjoyed in conversing with her he would speak with rapture  She was a violent whig and by consequence a declaimer for liberty a particular in her character that induced Johnson to compliment her in the following elegant epigram  Liber ut esse velim suasisti pulchra Maria  Ut maneam liberpulchra Maria vale  thus translated by Richard Paul Jodrell  Esq  When fair Maria's soft persuasive strain  Bids universal liberty to reign  Oh how at variance are her lips and eyes  For while the charmer talks the gazer dies  but this was in the lifetime of Mrs Johnson and he was a man too strict in his morals to give any reasonable cause of jealousy to a wife  The melancholy which seized Johnson on the death of his wife was not in degree such as usually follows the deprivation of near relations and friends it was of the blackest and deepest kind That affection which could excite in the mind of Milton the pleasing images described in his sonnet on his deceased wife  Methought I saw my late espoused saint  wrought no such effect on that of Johnson the apparition of his departed wife was altogether of the terrific kind and hardly afforded him a hope that she was in a state of happiness  That these gloomy conceptions were in part owing to the books he had been accustomed to read I have little doubt Sundry passages occur in his writings which induce a suspicion that his notions of the state of departed spirits were such as are now deemed superstitious and I will not attempt to vindicate him from the charge of believing some of the many relations extant that go to prove an intercourse between them and the inhabitants of this earth These as they were fystematical and such as he was able to defend by arguments the most specious I can no better account for than by a supposition that in the course of his studies he had been a dabbler in demonology by which I mean not the writings of those vulgar authors who relate the intrigues and midnight banquets of witches with infernal spirits or that teach the difference between black and white witches and assert the power of them and their agents to harm us but from those more authentic writers namely Mede and others whose proofs that the doctrine of demons made a part of the gentile theology have induced an opinion that in these later times departed spirits have such an existence as the intercourse abovementioned seems to imply  Not to dwell longer on so painful a subject I will dismiss these reflections with an observation that by the unhappiness of his bodily constitution and the defect of his organs of sense he was rendered unsusceptible of almost all those delights which we term pleasures of the imagination and which help to soothe the mind under affliction and this melancholy truth I shall attempt to illustrate by the following observations  With respect to sight it must be noted that he was of that class of men who from a defect in the visual organs are termed myops or nearsighted persons and farther that disease had deprived him of the use of one eye the consequence whereof was that in lieu of those various delightful prospects which the face of nature affords the beautiful and the grand that multiply ideas and administer delight as well in the reflection as the immediate enjoyment of them his mind was presented with an universal blank Nor was his misfortune less with respect to those objects wherein beauty symmetry and harmony of parts and proportions are resident to him a statue was an unshapen mass and a sumptuous edifice a quarry of stone Of the beauties of painting notwithstanding the many eulogiums on that art which after the commencement of his friendship with Sir Joshua Reynolds he inserted in his writings he had not the least conception and this leads me to mention a fact to the purpose which I well remember One evening at the club I came in with a small roll of prints which in the afternoon I had picked up I think they were landscapes of Perelle and laying it down with my hat Johnson's curiosity prompted him to take it up and unroll it he viewed the prints severally with great attention and asked me what sort of pleasure such things could afford me I told him that as representations of nature containing an assemblage of such particulars as render rural scenes delightful they presented to my mind the objects themselves and that my imagination realised the prospect before me he said that was more than his would do for that  in his whole life he was never capable of discerning the least resemblance of any kind between a picture and the subject it was intended to represent  To the delights of music he was equally insensible neither voice nor instrument nor the harmony of concordant sounds had power over his affections or even to engage his attention Of music in general he has been heard to say  'it excites in my mind no ideas and hinders me from contemplating my own'  and of a fine singer or instrumental performer that  'he had the merit of a Canarybird  I have sometimes thought that music was positive pain to him Upon his once hearing a celebrated performer go through a hard composition and hearing it remarked that it was very difficult Johnson said  'I would it had been impossible'  As a science of which he was ignorant he contemned it In the early part of my life I had collected some memoirs of Abbate Steffani Mr Handel's predecessor at the court of Hanover and the composer of those fine duets that go under his name with a view to print them as presents to some musical friends I submitted the manuscript to Johnson's perusal and he returned it with corrections that turned to ridicule all I had said of him and his works  '  Not that his hearing was so defective as to account for this insensibility but he laboured under the misfortune which he has noted in his life of Barretier and is common to more persons than in this musical age are willing to confess it of wanting that additional sense or faculty which renders music grateful to the human ear  From this state of his mental and bodily constitution it must necessarily be inferred that his comforts were very few and that his mind had no counterpoise against those evils of sickness sorrow and want which at different periods of his life he laboured under and in some of his writings pathetically laments Of this misfortune himself was sensible  and the frequent reflection thereon wrought in him a persuasion that the evils of human life preponderated against the enjoyments of it and this opinion he would frequently enforce by an observation on the general use of narcotics in all parts of the world as in the east and southern countries opium in the west and northern spirituous liquors and tobacco  He has been heard to remark that since the disuse of smoaking among the better sort of people suicide has been more frequent in this country than before  and into this principle he resolved most of the temptations to ebriety To the use of the former of these himself had a strong propensity which increased as he advanced in years his first inducement to it was relief against watchfulness but when it became habitual it was the means of positive pleasure and as such was resorted to by him whenever any depression of spirits made it necessary His practice was to take it in substance that is to say half a grain levigated with a spoon against the side of a cup half full of some liquid which as a vehicle carried it down  With so few resources of delight it is not to be wondered at if after the loss of his wife his melancholy was hardly supportable Company and conversation were the only reliefs to it and when these failed him he was miserable At the club in Ivy lane our usual hour of departure was eleven and when that approached he was frequently tempted to wander the streets and join in the conversation of those miserable females who were there to be met with Of these he was very inquisitive as to their course of life the history of their seduction and the chances of reclaiming them The first question he generally  asked was if they could read Of one who was very handsome he asked for what she thought God had given her so much beauty she answered  'To please gentlemen  This story is too well attested for me to omit it but it leaves it a question how with the defect of sight under which he laboured he was capable of discerning beauty He might possibly think it an indispensable requisite for her profession and therefore conclude that she had it  '  In the midst of the distresses which at this period of his life surrounded him he found both inclination and the means to be helpful to others His wife a short time before her death had consigned to his care a friend of her own sex a person of very extraordinary endowments whom for a benevolent purpose that will be shortly mentioned Johnson had invited to a residence in his house This was Mrs Anna Williams whose history is as follows  Her father Zachariah Williams was a surgeon and physician in South Wales a man of parts and great ingenuity he had addicted himself to mathematical studies and having by a kind of intuitive penetration discovered that the variations of the magnetic needle were equal at equal distances east and west he entertained a sanguine hope that he had attained the means of ascertaining the longitude As London was the place where he thought he should best avail himself of his discovery and also turn it to the improvement of his fortunes he in the year with an apparatus of mathematical and nautical instruments of his own invention left his habitation and business and together with his daughter settled in the metropolis His first business was to lay before the commissioners of the longitude the fruits of his  studies but upon a due examination they all proved abortive no proportion whatever of the reward could be assigned him as his due but as a kind of recompence for his disappointment means were found to procure him a maintenance in the Charterhouse and accordingly he was admitted into that asylum of age and poverty With all his ingenuity and scientific wisdom which I have heard his daughter with an excusable partiality magnify beyond credibility he must have been defective in worldly prudence for either by the infraction of oeconomical regulations or some other misconduct respecting the endowment from which he derived his support he rendered himself at first obnoxious to censure from the governors and in the end was obliged to forego all the benefits of it to become an outcast and at the age of seventyfive to suffer shipwreck in the wide ocean of the world In a narrative published in he complains of his expulsion as an act of injustice  What became of him afterwards I could never learn save that in the year he published in Italian and English a book intitled  'An account of an attempt to ascertain the longitude at sea by an exact theory of the magnetical needle'  written as it is supposed by Johnson and translated by Mr Baretti Of his daughter I am able to say more having known her a long time About ten years after her arrival with her father in London she was alarmed by the appearance of a cataract on both her eyes which continued to increase till it totally deprived her of her sight Before this calamity befel her she with the assistance of her father had acquired a knowledge of the French and Italian  languages and had made great improvements in literature which together with the exercise of her needle at which she was very dextrous as well after the loss of her sight as before contributed to support her under her affliction till a time when it was thought by her friends that relief might be obtained from the hand of an operating surgeon At the request of Dr Johnson I went with her to a friend of mine Mr Samuel Sharp senior surgeon of Guy's hospital who before had given me to understand that he would couch her gratis if the cataract was ripe but upon making the experiment it was found otherwise and that the crystalline humour was not sufficiently inspissated for the needle to take effect She had been almost a constant companion of Mrs Johnson for some time before her decease but had never resided in the house afterwards for the convenience of performing the intended operation Johnson took her home and upon the failure of that kept her as the partner of his dwelling till he removed into chambers first in Gray's inn and next in the Temple Afterward in upon his taking a house in Johnson's court in Fleet street he invited her thither and in that and his last house in Bolt court she successively dwelt for the remainder of her life  The loss of her sight made but a small abatement of her chearfulness and was scarce any interruption of her studies With the assistance of two female friends she translated from the French of Pere La Bletrie the life of the emperer Julian  See it mentioned in Nichols's Life of Bowyer  In Mr Garrick ever disposed to help the afflicted indulged  her with a benefitplay that produced her two hundred pounds and in she published by subscription a quarto volume of miscellanies in prose and verse and thereby increased her little fund to three hundred pounds which being prudently invested yielded an income that under such protection as she experienced from Dr Johnson was sufficient for her support  She was a woman of an enlightened understanding plain as the women call it in her person and easily provoked to anger but possessing nevertheless some excellent moral qualities among which no one was more conspicuous than her desire to promote the welfare and happiness of others and of this she gave a signal proof by her solicitude in favour of an institution for the maintenance and education of poor deserted females in the parish of St Sepulchre London supported by the voluntary contributions of ladies and as the foundationstone of a fund for its future subsistence she bequeathed to it the whole of that little which by the means abovementioned she had been able to accumulate To the endowments and qualities here ascribed to her may be added a larger share of experimental prudence than is the lot of most of her sex Johnson in many exigences found her an able counsellor and seldom shewed his wisdom more than when he hearkened to her advice In return she received from his conversation the advantages of religious and moral improvement which she cultivated so as in a great measure to smooth the constitutional asperity of her temper When these particulars are known this intimacy which began with compassion and terminated in a  friendship that subsisted till death dissolved it will be easily accounted for  Johnson had but for a short time enjoyed the relief from solitude and melancholy reflection which this friendly attachment afforded him before he experienced that affliction which in the course of nature is the concomitant of longevity in the loss of his friend Cave who finished a useful and wellspent life in the month of January It might seem that between men so different in their endowments and tempers as Johnson and Cave were little of true friendship could subsist but the contrary was the case Cave though a man of a saturnine disposition had a sagacity which had long been exercised in the discrimination of men in searching into the recesses of their minds and finding out what they were fit for and a liberality of sentiment and action which under proper restrictions inclined him not only to encourage genius and merit but to esteem and even to venerate the possessors of those qualities as often as he met with them it cannot therefore be supposed but that he entertained a high regard for such a man as Johnson and having had a long experience of his abilities and integrity that he had improved this disposition into friendship Johnson on his part sought for other qualities in those with whom he meant to form connections had he determined to make only those his friends whose endowments were equal to his own his life would have been that of a Carthusian he was therefore more solicitous to contract friendships with men of probity and integrity and endued with good moral qualities than with those whose intellectual powers or literary attainments were the  most conspicuous part of their character and of the former Cave had a share sufficient to justify his choice  On this mutual regard for each other as on a solid basis rested the friendship between Johnson and Cave It was therefore with a degree of sorrow proportioned to his feelings towards his friends which were ever tender that Johnson reflected on the loss he had to sustain and became the narrator of the most important incidents of his life In the account which he has given of his death it will be readily believed that what he has related respecting the constancy of his friendship is true and that when as the last act of reason he fondly pressed the hand that was afterwards employed in recording his memory his affection was sincere  By some papers now in my hands it seems that notwithstanding Johnson was paid for writing the Rambler he had a remaining interest in the copyright of that paper which about this time he sold The produce thereof the pay he was receiving for his papers in the Adventurer and the fruits of his other literary labours had now exalted him to such a state of comparative affluence as in his judgment made a manservant necessary Soon after the decease of Mrs Johnson the father of Dr Bathurst arrived in England from Jamaica and brought with him a negroservant a native of that island whom he caused to be baptized and named Francis Barber and sent for instruction to Burton upon Tees in Yorkshire upon the decease of captain Bathurst for so he was called Francis went to live with his son who willingly parted with him to Johnson The uses for which he was intended  to serve this his last master were not very apparent for Diogenes himself never wanted a servant less than he seemed to do the great bushy wig which throughout his life he affected to wear by that closeness of texture which it had contracted and been suffered to retain was ever nearly as impenetrable by a comb as a quickset hedge and little of the dust that had once settled on his outer garments was ever known to have been disturbed by the brush In short his garb and the whole of his external appearance was not to say negligent but slovenly and even squalid to all which and the necessary consequences of it he appeared as insensible as if he had been nurtured at the cape of Good Hope he saw that notwithstanding these offensive peculiarities in his manners his conversation had great attractions and perhaps he might estimate the strength of the one by the degree of the other and thence derive that apathy which after all might have its foundation in pride and afforded him occasion for a triumph over all the solicitudes respecting dress  That he was an habitual sloven his best friends cannot deny When I first knew him he was little less so than Magliabechi of whom it is said that at meals he made a book serve him for a plate and that he very seldom changed his linen or washed himself It is said of other scholars and men eminent in literature of Leibnitz Poiret St Evremond and Pope that they were alike uncleanly Johnson as his acquaintance with persons of condition became more enlarged and his invitations to dinnerparties increased corrected in some degree this failing but could never be said to be neatly dressed or indeed clean he affected to wear cloaths of the darkest and dirtiest colours and in all weathers black stockings His wig never sat even on his head as may be observed in all the pictures of him the reason whereof was that he had a twist in his shoulders and that the motion of his head as soon as he put it on dragged it awry    Of this negroservant much has been said by those who knew little or nothing of him in justification of that partiality which Johnson shewed for him and his neglect of his own necessitous relations The following particulars are all that are worth relating of him He stayed with Johnson about five years that is to say till and then left him but at the end of two years returned and was taken again into his service His first master had in great humanity made him a Christian and his last for no assignable reason nav rather in despight of nature and to unfit him for being useful according to his capacity determined to make him a scholar  He placed him at a school at BishopStortford and kept him there five years and as Mrs Williams was used to say who would frequently reproach him with his indiscretion in this instance expended three hundred pounds in an endeavour to have him taught Latin and Greek  Mrs Wiliams who with a view to the interest of her friend was very attentive to the conduct of this his favourite when she took occasion to complain to his master of his misbehaviour would do it in such terms as these  'This is your scbolar your philosopher upon whom you have spent so many hundred pounds'    The proposal for the dictionary and other of his writings had exhibited Johnson to view in the character of a poet and a philologist to his moral qualities and his concern for the interests of religion and virtue the world were for some time strangers but no sooner were these manifested by the publication of the Rambler and the Adventurer than he was looked up to as a master of human life a practical Christian  and a divine his acquaintance was sought by persons of the first eminence in literature and his house in respect of the conversations there became an academy One person in particular who seems for a great part of his life to have affected the character of a patron of learned and ingenious men in a letter which I have seen made him a tender of his friendship in terms to this effect  'That having perused many of his writings and thence conceived a high opinion of his learning his genius and moral qualities if Mr Johnson was inclined to enlarge the circle of his acquaintance he the letterwriter should be glad to be admitted into the number of his friends and to receive a visit from him'  This person was Mr Dodington afterwards lord Melcombe the value and honour of whose patronage to speak the truth may in some degree be estimated by his diary lately published but better by the account which I mean here to give of his favourites and dependents with some of whom I was personally acquainted How Johnson received this invitation I know not as it was conveyed in very handsome expressions it required some apology for declining it and I cannot but think he framed one  One of the earliest of lord Melcombe's clients was Dr Edward Young the author of the Satires of the Nightthoughts and of the Revenge a tragedy a man who by a strange fatality could never attain to any of those distinctions in his profession which are generally understood to be the rewards of learning and piety and must be supposed to have failed by the ardour with which he solicited and the servile adulation which he practised to come at them of which latter disposition  he has given such instances in the dedications of his fatires to the several persons of high rank to whom they are addressed as also in the exordium to each of the Nightthoughts at their first coming abroad for in the later edition they are omitted as are a disgrace to manhood and must have put the vainest of his patrons to the blush  Mr James Ralph was another of his dependents of whom as a pretender to genius much may be learned from the Dunciad He was the tool of that party of which his lordship laboured in vain to become the leader and to serve its purposes by inflaming the minds of the people wrote a weekly paper called the Remembrancer  Whoever is desirous of being acquainted with the intrigues of contending factions and the methods of exciting popular discontent may receive ample information from the perusal of lord Melcombe's Diary and will there find that to effect this purpose and furnish the unthinking multitude with topics for clamour the publication of a political newspaper was by him and his party thought expedient I have been credibly informed that dean Swift would frequently boast that with liberty allowed him for the free exercise of his pen or the measures of government he was able to write down any ministry whatever  For this and other good deeds of the like kind he is in the diary abovementioned held forth as an exemplar to all writers of his profession and dignified with the character of an honest man  Another of these men of genius who enjoyed the favour of Mr Dodington was Mr Paul Whitehead whose love for his country and knowledge of its interests became first known by a satire of his writing entitled  'The State Dunces'  which as he was a patriot and as all patriots pretend to be a firm friend to what they call the constitution bears this candid motto  I from my soul sincerely hate  Both kings and ministers of state  He also wrote  'Manners'  a satire a libel of a more general tendency as including in it many invectives against some of the nobility and most eminent of the dignified clergy  Of this man who many years was my neighbour in the country I know much to blame and somewhat to commend he may be supposed in his younger days to have imbibed that malevolence against the Hanover succession which was the sentiment of many at the beginning of this century and by an easy transition to which the perusal of such papers as the Craftsman Commonsense and other publications of the time and most of all the conversation of such persons as he chose for his associates might probably lead him to have engendered in his mind a hatred of all whose offices in the state had made the support of government their duty and a resolution to acquiesce in that fallacious discrimination of two classes of men the one whereof was in and the other out of power into the court and country parties  It is not much to the credit of the latter of these two that some of the writers on the fide of it were such avowed enemies to religion as might beget in those acquainted with their characters a suspicion that as in the language of politics there is an alliance between church and state a similar relation subsists between infidelity and patriotism proofs whereof have not been wanting in these our late times for it is evident that as the injunctions to obedience imply religion the want thereof  quoad  the person who is to pay it vacates the obligation and leaves him at liberty to form an alliance with the other side  And that some of the writers on the side of the country party as it was called particularly in the Craftsman were men of this character is certain Amhurst the ostensible author of the paper was expelled his university and was moreover a friend and associate of Strutt an attorney of the temple who wrote several letters or essays in his paper and a treatise with some such title as  'A philosophical enquiry into the nature of human liberty'  wherein the freedom of the human will is denied and the actions of men are made to result from an irresistible necessity This tract I have heard Whitehead commend and assert that it contained a full refutation of all that Dr Clarke in his controversy with Leibnitz has advanced in favour of the contrary opinion and at the same time speak of the author as one whom the greatness of his parts had he lived would have raised to the dignity of lordchancellor but of whose moral and religious principles a judgment may be formed by means of the following letter which for the atheistical expressions contained therein was the ground for the expulsion of the writer of it from the university of Cambridge I forbear remarking on this blasphemous epistle farther than that the regret I have often felt in the perusal of it has been not a little increased by the figure that my friend Paul makes in it and the intimacy between him and Strutt which it discloses  To Mr STEPHEN GBBS  Oct  Dear Stephen  I received yours with the guinea and the partridges for which I return you many thanks and need not say how much I should rejoice in your company at  the eating of them But we not only suffer the loss of that but of P B's too who went to London incog last Monday and it is uncertain when he'll have power to break from the arms of his charmer but V will supply his place at the Tuns today who is as great a hero in the cause of truth  I am very glad to hear W B appears so well in the world again and when you see him beg you would remember my kind respects to him wishing him all joy And as to any farther progress in atheism I was arriv'd at the top the ne plus ultra before I enjoyed the beatifick vision the night I was born in the spirit from you being fixed and immoveable in the knowledge of the truth to which I attained by means of that infallible guide the Philosophical Enquiry and I am glad to hear what I did not at all doubt of that it would equally enlighten your understanding and am persuaded that you see the necessary connection between every proposition and consequently that the points now in debate are strictly demonstrated If any material objection should arise which is barely a possible supposition I beg you will consult me or some other able minister of the word of truth to the quieting of your conscience and avoiding all scruple and doubt  I was inexpressibly happy with the most adorable and omniscient Father Strutt his brother Whitehead W c completely fulfilling the scene proposed in his letter  On Saturday we came to Cambridge where we had the full enjoyment of their's till Tuesday when  they return'd to Bury and last Saturday I went thither again by appointment but they were obliged to set out that day for London and I went with them to Sudbury where we lay You'll imagine I was transported with their company and would not have left them before they got to London but that I was obliged to return to college to pray  I've sent you one song as a taste of our mirth  Supposed to be  'Religion's a politic law'  I receiv'd a letter from the president yesterday which obliges me to return to Horksley next TuesdayI hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you in college about the th of November In the mean time I shall be glad of a line or two from you and am  Your sincere friend and humble servant T DCKT  PS Strutt was the author of the three letters in the last Craftsmen except last Saturday's and will write in defence of them in answer to the ministerial writers I intend myself the pleasure of drinking tea with Polly this afternoon My service to Mr G Miss Nanny and all friends  The political principles of Whitehead recommended him to Mr Dodington whose ostentation was gratified and his ambitious views in a way to be advanced by a connection with a man who had abilities to write and the boldness to publish whatever might serve the purposes of a party and whose zeal for its interests was subject to any direction  Dodington admired the keenness of Whitehead's wit and the spirit of his satires and his commendations were repaid by the latter with encomiums on his patron's political wisdom and qualifications for state employments which as they seemed to have no foundation in principle Paul was as little able to investigate as to delineate the path of a comet In his conversation there was little to praise it was desultory vociferous and profane He had contracted a habit of swearing in his younger years which he retained to his latest At Twickenham he never frequented divine service and when pressed by one of his friends there to shew himself at church excused himself by saying he was not settled He was visited by very few of the inhabitants of the village but his house was open to all his London friends among whom were Mr Hogarth Isaac Ware the architect George Lambert and Hayman the painters and Mr Havard the player men who had spent all their lives in and about Coventgarden and looked upon it as the school of manners and an epitome of the world  Paul was endowed with a great portion of wit but it was altogether of the satyrical kind and served to little purpose other than to expose to ridicule or contempt the objects to which it was directed In concert with one Carey a surgeon he planned and exhibited a procession along the Strand of persons on foot and on horseback dressed for the occasion carrying mock ensigns and the symbols of freemasonry  A print of the procession designed and engraved by Benoist was published about the time  the design of which was to expose to laughter the insignia and ceremonies of that mysterious institution  and it was not till thirty years after that the fraternity recovered the disgrace which so ludicrous a representation had brought on it  After enumerating these his exceptionable qualities it is but justice to say of Whitehead that he was by nature a friendly and kindhearted man well acquainted with vulgar manners and the town but little skilled in the knowledge of the world and by consequence little able to resist the arts of designing men and of this defect he gave a melancholy proof in submitting to be engaged for Fleetwood the patentee of Drurylane theatre in a bond for l for failure in the payment whereof he sustained imprisonment in the Fleet for some of the best years of his life He had married a woman of a good family and fortune whom though homely in her person and little better than an idiot he treated not only with humanity but with tenderness hiding as well as he was able those defects in her understanding which are oftener the subjects of ridicule than of compassion After his enlargement some money fell to him with which and the profits of the place of deputytreasurer of the chamber which he held for some time under lord Le Despenser he purchased a cottage on Twickenham common and from a design and under the inspection of his friend Isaac Ware at a small expence improved it into an elegant dwelling Here he manifested the goodness of his nature in the exercise of kind offices in healing breaches and composing differences between his poor neighbours and living to see as he did at the commencement of his present majesty's reign power lodged in the hands of such as he thought friends of their country and above all temptations to abuse it  he abandoned his factious principles and became a loyal subject In a grateful sense of his obligations to lord Le Despenser he directed that after his decease his heart inclosed in a vessel for the purpose should be presented to him which being done his lordship caused it to be deposited in his church of West Wycomb  Dr Thompson was one of the many physicians who in this country have enjoyed a shortlived reputation acquired by methods unknown to any but themselves The earliest of his practice was among men of eminence Mr Pope and others who deceived by his confidence and a certain contempt with which he ever spoke of the rest of his profession as being bigotted to theories and systems looked upon him as a man of an inventive genius who had reduced the art of healing to an epitome The fact was that affecting to be a freethinker in his faculty he set at nought the discoveries and improvements of others and treated with ridicule that practice which he did not understand He was an everlasting prater on politics and criticism and saw so deep into the councils of the king of Prussia that he could assign the motives of all his actions during the last war in which he was engaged At taverns in coffeehouses at the cydercellar in Maiden lane he was frequently to be found holding forth on these subjects without interruption in a tone of voice which Mr Garrick would say was like the buz of an humblebee in a hallwindow This man enjoyed the favour of lord Melcombe and what was of greater benefit to him an apartment in his house with a protection from arrests founded on the privilege which the law grants  not only to peers but to the lowest of their menial servants  Quin once told me a story of this man which I will relate in as few words as I am ableQuin walking up and down one Sunday evening in the Bedford coffeehouse observed a man in a dark corner leaning his forehead on the table and every now and then sending forth a sigh that seemed to come from his heart Moved with compassion he went up to him and enquiring the cause of his grief was told by him that his name was Thompson that he was a physician rising into practice but that for want of fifty pounds his chariot could not go abroad the next day and his patients must remain unvisited Quin bid him be comforted and stepping to his lodgings in Bedford street returned with a banknote for that sum which he told Thompson he would not expect till he was able to repay it the other answered that a month was as long as he wished to retain it but Quin told him that he could spare it for three or even six months and took his leave Six months elapsed and no apology made for nonpayment of the money Quin in a civil letter reminded Thompson of the terms on which it was lent but receiving no answer to that and others that he wrote he was obliged to send him one by his attorney which produced a notification from the duke of Newcastle's office that the name of Dr Thompson was there entered as of a person privileged from arrests and that it would be at Mr Quin's peril if he proceeded to violate that protection which he claimed and the law granted him Being thus prohibited from the restraint of his person Quin was obliged to wait the repayment of his money  which at the expiration of some months he received but without the least acknowledgment of his kindness in lending it  This was a man whom Whitehead in the simplicity of his heart held in such estimation that I have seen him for hours together listening with his lips unclosed to the torrents of nonsense he was pouring forth he addressed an epistle to him wherein he celebrates his medical abilities and moral qualities and makes the number of persons daily restored by him to health equal to those who were sent to their longhomes by Wilmot and the other eminent physicians his rivals and contemporaries  Notwithstanding the advantages with which he set out and the extravagant encomiums of Fielding and others of him and his practice Thompson sunk into contempt and obscurity Like Paracelsus he performed a few cures that neither himself nor any others were ever able to account for and in a case of surgery he was once known by dint of mere obstinacy to have saved a limb A son of a friend of mine an officer being in the service in Germany and at the head of a skirmishingparty on horseback received a wound with a sabre that separated the tendons and ligaments which connect the foot with the leg at a consultation on his case of two of the most eminent surgeons Thompson as being the family physician was called to assist who in opposition to their opinion that an amputation was inevitable swore that his friend should not undergo it the operation was deferred and by the help of the Malvern waters the patient recovered such an use of the whole limb as enabled him to walk with scarce any variation of his accustomed gait  Had Johnson accepted of Mr Dodington's invitation it cannot be supposed that he would have been much pleased with the company of these and such other persons as it was likely to introduce him to His declining it seems therefore an act of great prudence and indeed he was exempted from the necessity of seeking connections for many persons were of Dodington's mind and were desirous of adding him to the number of their friends Invitations to dine with such of those as he liked he so seldom declined that to a friend of his he said  'I never but once upon a resolution to employ myself in study balked an invitation out to dinner and then I stayed at home and did nothing'  Little however did that laxity of temper which this confession seems to imply retard the progress of the great work in which he was employed the conclusion and also the perfection of his dictionary were objects from which his attention was not to be diverted the avocations he gave way to were such only as when complied with served to invigorate his mind to the performance of his engagements to his employers and the public and hasten the approach of the day that was to reward his labour with applause  That day it was his happiness to see for by the end of the year he had completed his copy not more to his own ease and satisfaction than to the joy of Millar the bookseller the principal proprietor of the work and the guardian or treasurer of the fund out of which the payments were from time to time issued To say the truth his joy on the occasion was so great that he could not refrain from expressing it somewhat intemperately as appears by the following  acknowledgment of the receipt of the last sheet of the manuscript  'Andrew Millar sends his compliments to Mr Samuel Johnson with the money for the last sheet of copy of the Dictionary and thanks God he has done with him'  To which Johnson returned this goodhumoured and brief answer  'Samuel Johnson returns his compliments to Mr Andrew Millar and is very glad to find as he does by his note that Andrew Millar has the grace to thank God for any thing'  The publication of this great work soon followed as may be imagined the interchange of these two very laconic epistles and the month of May put the world in possession of a treasure the value whereof it will require the experience of years to find out To recommend it to the notice of foreigners he was desirous it should appear to come from one who had attained academical honours he therefore applied by his friend Mr Thomas Warton to the university of Oxford for a master's degree and obtained it by a diploma dated the tenth day of February the tenour whereof is that the most learned Samuel Johnson of Pembroke college having distinguished himself in the literary world by his writings tending to form the popular manners and having for the adorning and settling his native language compiled and being about to publish an English dictionary the chancellor masters and scholars of the said University in solemn convocation assembled do therefore constitute and appoint the said Samuel  Johnson Master of Arts and command that he enjoy and exercise all the rights privileges and honours to that degree appertaining  Upon the receipt of this instrument Johnson testified his gratitude for the honour done him in a letter to the vicechancellor which as a specimen of a fine Latin style I here insert  Reverendo admodum viro G Huddesford STP Oxoniensis academiae Vicecancellario dignissimo  'Ingratus plane et tibi et mihi videar nisi quanto me gaudio affecerint quos nuper mihi honores te credo auctore decrevit senatus academicus literarum quo tamen nihil levius officio significem ingratus etiam nisi comitatem qua vir eximius  The Vir eximius abovementioned is Dr King of St Mary hall who delivered the diploma to Johnson in London  mihi vestri testimonium amoris in manus tradidit agnoscam et laudem Siquid est unde rei tam gratae accedat gratia hoc ipso magis mihi placet quod eo tempore in ordines academicos denuo cooptatus sim quo tuam imminuere auctoritatem famamque Oxoniae laedere omnibus modis conantur homines vafri nec tamen acuti quibus ego prout viro umbratico licuit semper restiti semper restiturus Qui enim inter has rerum procellas vel tibi vel academiae defuerit illum virtuti et literis sibique et posteris defuturum existimo  S JOHNSON  So near perfection had the author brought his dictionary that upon a review of it previous to his drawing up the preface he declares he is unable to detect the casual omission of more than one article  the appellative OCEAN Nor has he as I know been charged with any other defect or with any misinterpretation of a word save in an instance or two where being moved by partyprejudice he has imposed significations on a few words that are indefensible Let these be imputed to a mind agonized at various periods during the prosecution of this laborious work with indigence with sorrow and pain and let the piteous description of his circumstances and feelings which the preface contains induce us to bury our resentment of a few petulant expressions in the reflection that this stupendous compilation was undertaken and completed by the care and industry of a single person  Upon occasion of publishing the dictionary Mr Garrick celebrated the author in the following lines  Talk of war with a Briton he'll boldly advance  That one English soldier will beat ten of France  Would we alter the boast from the sword to the pen  Our odds are still greater still greater our men  In the deep mines of science though Frenchmen may toil  Can their strength be compar'd to Locke Newton and Boyle  Let them rally their heroes send forth all their pow'rs  Their versemen and prosemen then match them with ours  First Shakespeare and Milton like Gods in the fight  Have put their whole drame and epic to flight  In satires epistles and odes would they cope  Their numbers retreat before Dryden and Pope  And Johnson wellarm'd like a hero of yore  Has beat forty  The number of the French academy employed in settling their language  French and will beat forty more  It has already been mentioned that Johnson's inducement to this undertaking was the offer of a liberal reward The term liberal is indefinite and after the lapse of twenty years during which such sums as from three to eight thousand pounds have been paid for copies would hardly be allowed to fifteen hundred and seventyfive  From the original contract now in my hand dated th June between Johnson on the one part and the two Knaptons the two Longmans Charles Hitch Andrew Millar and Robert Dodsley on the other  which was the sum stipulated for the dictionary Of this Johnson who was no very accurate accountant thought a great part would be coming to him on the conclusion of the work but upon producing at a tavernmeeting for the purpose of settling receipts for sums advanced to him which were indeed the chief means of his subsistence it was found not only that he had eaten his cake but that the balance of the account was greatly against him His debtors were now become his creditors but they in a perfect consistency with that liberal spirit which in sundry instances the great booksellers are known to have exercised towards authors remitted the difference and consoled him for his disappointment by making his entertainment at the tavern a treat  Mr William Caslon the letterfounder grandfather of the present Mr Caslon once told me that the booksellers with whom Mr Chambers had contracted for his dictionary finding that the work succeeded beyond their expectations made him a voluntary present of I think l Other instances of the like generosity have been known of a profession of men who in the debates of the question of literary property have been described as scandalous monopolizers fattening at the expence of other mens' ingenuity and growing opulent by oppression    The pointing out the utility of such a work as a vernacular lexicon is needless and the displaying the merits of that of which I am speaking is a labour which the suffrage of the public has saved me The learned world had long wished for its appearance and the circulation of the book was proportionate to the impatience which the promise of it had excited Lord Corke being at Florence at the time when it was published presented it in the author's name to the academy della Crusca and that learned body transmitted to him a fine copy of their Vocabulario The French academy also signified their approbation of his labours by a present of their Dictionnaire of which Mr Langton was the bearer To these testimonies of public respect it is a small but Judicrous addition to say that Dr Robertson the Scots historian told Johnson that he had fairly perused his dictionary twice over and that Johnson was pleased at the hearing it The dictionary was a librarybook and not adapted to common use the booksellers knowing this and being encouraged by its success easily prevailed on the author to abridge it in two octavo volumes and made him a liberal recompence  It was doubtless a great satisfaction to Johnson to have completed this great work and though we may  believe him in the declaration at the end of the preface thereto that he dismissed it with frigid tranquility we cannot but suppose that he was pleased with the reception it met with One and only one writer excited by that envy and malice which had been long rankling in his breast attempted to disturb the quiet which possessed him by animadverting on this and other of his writings this was a Dr Kenrick the author of many scurrilous publications now deservedly forgotten who in a small volume intitled  'Lexiphanes'  endeavoured to turn many passages in the Rambler and interpretations in the dictionary into ridicule gratifying his spleen also with a number of malevolent censures of Dr Akenside's  'Pleasures of Imagination'  It was the purpose of this libel to provoke both or one of the persons who were the subjects of it to a controversy from which whatever should be the event he hoped as it is said Ulysses did in his contest with Ajax to derive honour  Iste tulit pretium jam nunc certaminis hujus  Quo cum victus erit mecum certasse feretur  OVID Met lib xiii v  Losing he wins because his name will be  Ennobled by defeat who durst contend with me  DRYDEN  But in this he was disappointed Akenside was too proud to dispute with an inferior and Johnson's silence proceeded not more from his contempt of such an adversary than from a settled resolution he had formed of declining all controversy in defence either of himself or his writings Against personal  abuse he was ever armed by a reflection that I have heard him utter  'Alas reputation would be of little worth were it in the power of every concealed enemy to deprive us of it'  and he defied all attacks on his writings by an answer of Dr Bentley to one who threatened to write him downthat  'no author was ever written down but by himself'  His steady perseverance in this resolution afforded him great satisfaction whenever he reflected on it and he would often selicitate himself that throughout his life he had had firmness enough to treat with contempt the calumny and abuse as well of open as concealed enemies and the malevolence of those anonymous scriblers whose trade is slander and wages infamy  Had Pope pursued the same conduct and forborne his revenge on Theobald Cibber and others who had provoked him he had enjoyed his muse and that philosophical tranquility which he did but affect and lived and died with dignity The younger Richardson once told me that upon the publication of Cibber's second letter he came to his father's house in Lincoln'sinn fields and upon entering the room where he was painting with a countenance that spoke the anguish of his soul exclaimed  'So I find another letter is come out' but continued he 'such things are sport to me'  in which assertion we may suppose him to be as sincere as that poet of whom a story goes that talking with a friend of the critics he said he had a way of dealing with them for whenever they condemned his verses he laughed at it  'Do you so' says his friend 'then let me tell  you you live the merriest life of any man in England'  That Bentley's observation is founded in truth and a knowledge of mankind is proved by the rank which Sir Richard Blackmore now holds among the English poets At the time when he lived the wits were in confederacy against him and so many are the lampoons epigrams and other satirical compositions extant tending to blast his reputation as a poet  See the works of Mr Thomas Brown in vols mo and Pope and Swift's miscellany  that the reader of them would incline to think that in all his works there is scarce a good line or sentiment All this as Johnson relates Blackmore foresaw and with a dignity of mind that merits praise despised the consequence is that his poem intitled  'Creation'  is not written down but yet lives in the esteem of every judicious reader and in that most elegant encomium which Mr Addison has bestowed on it in the Spectator  No  and Dennis one of the severest of critics has given it greater praise than he ever vouchsafed to any modern composition saying that it is  'a philosophical poem which has equalled that of Lucretius in the beauty of its versification and infinitely surpassed it in the solidity and strength of its reasoning'  To be insensible of and undisturbed by the envy and malice of others is one of the strongest proofs of a great mind and as it is the most justifiable so is it the severest revenge we can take for what sight can be more ridiculous than that of a creature  venting its rage on a subject that cannot feel To live in the dread of slander and to regulate our conduct by the opinions the whispers the surmises or threats of either foolish or wicked men is the worst of all slavery of him who cannot defy every attempt of this kind to disturb his peace but must be whining and complaining of that enmity which perhaps does him honour and scribbling to refute those calumnies which no one will believe it may be said as we say of a man labouring under a mortal disease  'He is no man for this world'  If he chooses a contrary course to that aboverecommended he does the work of those that hate him and will be sure to feel the pangs of resentment and forego the enjoyment of a tranquil mind and a conscience void of offence so feelingly described in this sentence of lord Bacon  'Certainly it is heaven upon earth to have a man's mind move in Charity rest in Providence and turn upon the poles of Truth'  If Johnson could ever be said to be idle now was the time He had for nine years been employed in his great work and had finished it he had closed the Rambler and the Adventurer was closed on him He had it now in his choice to reassume some one or other of those various literary projects which he had formed in the early part of his life and are enumerated in a foregoing page of these memoirs but the powers of his mind distended by long and severe exercise became relaxed and required rest to bring them to their tone and it was some time before he could resolve on any employment suited to his abilities that carried with it any prospect of pleasure  or hope of reward This remission of his labour which seemed to be no more than nature herself called for Johnson in those severe audits to which it was his practice to summon himself would frequently condemn styling it a waste of his time and a misapplication of the talents with which he was gratefully conscious that God had endowed him Yet herein was he greatly mistaken for though Milton says of the servants of God  thousands at his bidding speed  And post o'er land and ocean without rest  he adds that  They also serve who only stand and wait  Sonnet on his blindness  Johnson's intellectual faculties could never be unemployed when he was not writing he was thinking and his thoughts had ever a tendency to the good of mankind and that indolence which in his hours of contrition he censured as criminal needed little expiation  This recess from literary occupation continued however no longer than was absolutely necessary It has already been shewn that he was not only a friend to such vehicles of literary intelligence as Magazines and other epitomes of large works but that he was a frequent contributor to them He had occasionally for Cave's Magazine written the lives of Father Paul Sarpi Boerhaave the admirals Drake and Blake Barretier and divers other eminent persons and also sundry philological  essays particularly a state of the controversy between Crousaz and Warburton respecting the  'Essay on Man'  and a vision intitled  'the Apotheosis of Milton'  Cave being now dead he ceased to furnish articles for that publication and either voluntarily offered or suffered himself to be retained as a writer in others of a like kind accordingly in he wrote for  'the Universal Visitor or Monthly Memorialist'  printed for Gardner  The writers in this publication were Christopher Smart Richard Rolt Mr Garrick and Dr Percy now bishop of Dromore Their papers are signed with the initials of their surnames Johnson's have this mark * *  two of three letters therein inserted on the subject of agriculture and in the same and subsequent year he assumed or submitted to the office of a reviewer as it is called for the publisher of a monthly collection intitled  'The Literary Magazine'  of which one Faden a printer was the editor In this he wrote the address to the public also reviews of the following books viz Soame Jenyns's free enquiry into the nature and origin of evil Dr Blackwell's Memoirs of the court of Augustus he wrote also therein Observations on the state of affairs in and the Life of the present king of Prussia and Hanway's journal coming in his way which contained in it a severe censure of the practice of teadrinking he officially as I may say and with a degree of alacrity proportioned to his avowed love of that liquor undertook to criticise the book and refute the arguments of the author  To render this controversy intelligible it is necessary I should state the grounds on which it proceededMr Jonas Hanway had in the year undertaken and  performed a journey from Portsmouth to Kingston upon Thames through Southampton Wiltshire c which though completed in the space of eight days and attended with no extraordinary circumstances was it seems in his judgment worthy of being recorded and by means of the press transmitted to posterity and accordingly he gave a relation of it to the public in two octavo volumes It may be needless to say that this work abounds with miscellaneous thoughts moral and religious and also political reflections for of which of all his numerous productions cannot the same be said Connected with it is  'An Essay on Tea considered as pernicious to health obstructing industry and impoverishing the nation with an account of its growth and great consumption in these kingdoms  Mr Hanway seems not very accurate in his state of the time when tea was first brought into England He says that lord Arlington and lord Offory introduced it in and that it was then admired as a new thing Waller has a poem addressed to the queen Maria d'Este wife of Ja II in  'On tea commended by her majesty'  whereby it seems that even then it was a new thing  It is a question of some curiosity and worthy investigation what were the viands of a morning meal with people of condition for which tea with its concomitants is now the substitute and I am glad to be able to resolve it by the following extract from the Northumberland houshold book in which is contained the regulations and establishment of the houshold of Henry

by a redundancy of foreign matter and which violates every rule in logic I shall content myself with remarking that though every one of his three assertions may be true he has succeeded in the proof of no one of them That tea is a luxury and not a fit aliment for the poor is implied in a sarcasm of Swift to this purpose that the world must be encompassed that is to say by a voyage to the East Indies for tea and another to the West for sugar  before a washerwoman can sit down to breakfast That it is pernicious to health is disputed by physicians Quincy commends it as an elegant and wholesome beverage Cheyne condemns it as prejudicial to the nervous system Bishop Burnet for many years drank sixteen large cups of it every morning and never complained that it did him the least injury The two last objections that tea is an obstruction to industry and that it impoverishes the nation are political questions which I am not able to decide upon  Epictetus somewhere advises us to consider the gratification of the calls of hunger and thirst as acts of necessity to be performed as it were by the bye but by no means to be estimated among the enjoyments of life and by a precept no less than divine we are exhorted to take no thought what we shall eat or what we shall drink Johnson looked upon the former as a very serious business and enjoyed the pleasures of a splendid table equally with most men It was at no time of his life pleasing to see him at a meal the greediness with which he ate his total inattention to those among whom he was seated and his profound silence in the hour of refection were circumstances that at the instant degraded him and shewed him to be more a sensualist than a philosopher Moreover he was a lover of tea to an excess hardly credible whenever it appeared he was almost raving and by his impatience to be served his incessant calls for those ingredients which make that liquor palatable and the haste with which he swallowed it down he seldom failed to make that a fatigue to every one else which was intended as a general refreshment Such  signs of effeminacy as these suited but ill with the appearance of a man who for his bodily strength and stature has been compared to Polyphemus  This foible in Johnson's character being known it will excite no wonder in the reader to be told that he readily embraced the opportunity of defending his own practice by an examen of Hanway's book Accordingly he began his remarks on it in the Literary Magazine Number VII  From th Oct to th Nov  but receiving from this author an injunction to forbear proceeding in his censure till a second edition should appear he submitted though it was a prohibition that could neither be reasonably imposed nor by any means inforced yet such was its effect that Mr Hanway's journal was not remarked on till he had been allowed every advantage that could protect it from censure  Such candour on the part of him on whose opinion perhaps many were waiting to form theirs might have relieved the author from any dread of unfair treatment but Johnson who paid all proper deference to good intentions did not think this tacit indication of the temper in which he sat down to review Mr Hanway's journal sufficient he therefore in resuming the dispute promises him that he shall find no malignity of censure and draws a very handsome inference from the contents of his thirtytwo letters that he is a man whose failings may well be pardoned for his virtues  The criticism on this second edition appeared in the Literary Magazine Number XIII  From th April to th May  and extends  chiefly to Mr Hanway's arguments against tea and gin subjects which seem to have inspired him with such enthusiastic eloquence as disdained all the rules of logic and dictated observations and conclusions so incoherent and incongruous as would have stimulated even those who in the main thought with him to an endeavour at correcting his judgment  But in Johnson when writing on the qualities of tea he met with an opponent on principle for its antagonist's hatred however radical or zealous could not exceed the love its champion bore it he describes himself as  'a hardened and shameless teadrinker who has for many years diluted his meals with only the infusion of this fascinating plant whose kettle has scarcely time to cool who with tea amuses the evening with tea solaces the midnights and with tea welcomes the morning'  That Mr Hanway was right in asserting that the practice of drinking tea is productive of harm among the lower classes of people must certainly be admitted and that Johnson was right in denying that it has all the poisonous qualities the Journal attributes to it experience shews From what has been said on both sides little can be inferred but that to some it is noxious and to others neutral that those do wrong who persist in the use of it when they find it injurious to their health and that such as cannot afford the necessaries of life ought not to indulge in its luxuries  At Johnson's candid examen which should not have offended Mr Hanway as by submitting his work to public inspection he recognized the right of public criticism the latter was extremely irritated and  very unadvisedly drew his reviewer forth to a second exertion of his argumentative powers printed in the same Magazine vol ii under the title of  'A reply to a paper in the Gazetteer of May '  in which with seeming contrition and mock penitence he requests to know how he has offended and deprecates the wrath he had excited  'There are only three subjects' says he 'upon which my unlucky pen has happened to venture Tea the author of the Journal and the Foundling hospital'  'Of the author I unfortunately said that his injunction was too magisterial This I said before I knew he was a governor of the foundlings but he seems inclined to punish this failure of respect as the czar of Muscovy made war upon Sweden because he was not treated with sufficient honours when he passed through the country in disguise Yet was not this irreverence without extenuation Something was said of the merit of  meaning well  and the journalist was declared to be a man  whose failings might well be pardoned for his virtues  This is the highest praise which human gratitude can confer upon human merit praise that would have more than satisfied  Titus  or  Augustus  but which I must own to be inadequate and penurious when offered to the member of an important corporation  '  His justification of what he said of the author he concludes thus  'As the journalist though enthusiastically zealous for his country has with regard to smaller things the placid happiness of philosophical indifference I can give him no disturbance by advising him to restrain even the love of his country within due limits lest it should sometimes  swell too high fill the whole capacity of his soul and leave less room for the love of truth'  Unluckily for Mr Hanway it happened that while he was labouring for the general good by reprobating the practice of drinking tea an institution from which he derived much of his importance was suffering from want of care Johnson in a visit to the Foundling hospital observed that the objects of the charity however well provided for in other respects were in the essential point of religious knowledge lamentably deficient To him who considered wisely that there was no evil from which the governors of the Foundling hospital could rescue deserted infants so much to be dreaded as ignorance of this kind the answers given to his enquiries touching their improvement were very unsatisfactory Without knowing that Mr Hanway was concerned in the charge he in his former letter had stated this fact and followed it by saying that  'to breed up children in this manner is to rescue them from an early grave that they may find employment for the gibbet from dying in innocence that they may perish by their crimes'  The laudable motive which induced Johnson to point out this neglect and the justice of his remark did not shield him from unmerited resentment He was called on to support what he had advanced his assertion was branded with the epithet of  incredible  but his observation had produced its effect he had found means to have it represented to one of the highest names of the society and a catechist was soon after appointed  On a review of the eloquence he had been forced to encounter he says of his adversary  'His argumentation  being somewhat enthusiastical I cannot fully comprehend but it seems to stand thus My insinuations are foolish or malicious since I know not one of the governors of the hospital for he that knows not the governors of the hospital must be very foolish or malicious  'He has however so much kindness for me that he advises me to consult my own safety when I talk of corporations I know not what the most important corporation could do becoming manhood by which my safety is endangered My reputation is safe for I can prove the fact my quiet is safe for I meant well and for any other safety I am not used to be very solicitous  'I am always sorry when I see any being labouring in vain and in return for the journalist's attention to my safety I will confess some compassion for his tumultuous resentment since all his invectives fume into the air with so little effect upon me that I still esteem him as one that has the  merit of meaning well  and still believe him to be  a man whose failings may be justly pardoned for his virtues  '  Whoever peruses this controversy will be forced to confess that on the part of Johnson it is conducted not only with candour but with great good humour a circumstance to be remarked in all his polemical writings and to be wondered at seeing that in oral disputation his behaviour was so different as to expose him to the severest censures His exertions against his adversary were play not hostility  Sporting the lion ramp'd and in his paw  Dandled the kid  Paradise Lost book iv line  By the virtues of Mr Hanway which Johnson is so ready to acknowledge we are to understand that active and unwearied benevolence which for a series of years he has been exercising for the benefit of society and by his failings or rather failing for I know of but one he has a propensity to writing and publishing books which for the triteness and inanity of the sentiments contained in them no one can read  About the year time had produced a change in the situation of many of Johnson's friends who were used to meet him in lvy lane Death had taken from us M  c  Ghie Barker went to settle as a practising physician at Trowbridge Dyer went abroad Hawkesworth was busied in forming new connections and I had lately made one that removed from me all temptations to pass my evenings from home The consequence was that our symposium at the King's head broke up and he who had first formed us into a society was left with sewer around him than were able to support it  All this while the booksellers who by his own confession were his best friends had their eyes upon Johnson and reflected with some concern on what seemed to them a misapplication of his talents The furnishing magazines reviews and even newspapers with literary intelligence and the authors of books who could not write them for themselves with dedications and prefaces they looked on as employments beneath him who had attained to such eminence as a writer they therefore in the year found out for him such a one as seemed to afford a prospect both of amusement and profit this was an edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works  which by a concurrence of circumstances was now become necessary to answer the increasing demand of the public for the writings of that author  Mr Garrick who as every one knows was in all that related to Shakespeare an enthusiast had by the study of his principal characters and his own exquisite action so recommended Shakespeare to the town that the admiration of him became general even to affectation many professing to be delighted with the performance and perusal of his plays who from their want of literature and their ignorance of the phraseology of the age in which they were written could not be supposed capable of construing them Others there were in whom a literary curiosity had been excited by the publication of such editions of this author as tended to settle his text and by a description of ancient manners and customs of living to render him intelligible The first essay of this kind worth noting was the edition of Theobald the defects whereof in the single opinion of Warburton were so many and great as to render that necessary which bears his name  The two classes of readers here discriminated amounted to such a number as encouraged the booksellers to an edition on the plan of the two former and Johnson was the person whom of all others they thought the fittest to undertake it the terms settled between them were that Johnson should receive for his own use the profits arising from a subscription to the first impression and that the copyright should remain with the then possessors The first notification of this design was a proposal  drawn up by Johnson setting forth the incorrectness of the early editions the original obscurity and subsequent corruptions of the text the necessity of notes and the failures of former editors  A stranger to Johnson's character and temper would have thought that the study of an author whose skill in the science of human life was so deep and whose perfections were so many and various as to be above the reach of all praise must have been the most pleasing employment that his imagination could suggest but it was not so in a visit that he one morning made to me I congratulated him on his being now engaged in a work that suited his genius and that requiring none of that severe application which his dictionary had condemned him to I doubted not would be executed con amoreHis answer was  'I look upon this as I did upon the dictionary it is all work and my inducement to it is not love or desire of fame but the want of money which is the only motive to writing that I know of'  And the event was evidence to me that in this speech he declared his genuine sentiments for neither in the first place did he set himself to collect early editions of his author old plays translations of histories and of the classics and other materials necessary for his purpose nor could he be prevailed on to enter into that course of reading without which it seemed impossible to come at the sense of his author It was provoking to all his friends to see him waste his days his weeks and his months so long that they feared a mental lethargy had seized him out of which he would never recover In this however they were happily deceived for after  two years inactivity they find him roused to action and engagednot in the prosecution of the work for the completion whereof he stood doubly bound but in a new one the furnishing a series of periodical essays intitled and it may be thought not improperly  'The Idler'  as his motive to the employment was aversion to a labour he had undertaken though in the execution it must be owned it merited a better name  As Johnson was diverted from his work of Shakespeare so am I from my purpose of tracing the progress of it being to relate the occurrences of nine years of his life before I can congratulate the reader on its appearance  The engagement for the Idler was with Newbery the bookseller a man of a projecting head a good understanding and great integrity and who by a fortunate connection with Dr James the physician and the honest exertions of his own industry became the founder of a family Taking advantage of that rage for intelligence which the successes of the war had excited in even the lowest order of the people he planned a weekly paper which he called  'The Universal Chronicle'  and as the size of it rendered it susceptible of more matter than the occurrences during the intervals of its publication would supply it was part of his scheme that it should contain an essay or short discourse on such subjects of morality or of wit and humour as in former instances had been sound to engage the attention of the public A share in the profits of this paper was Johnson's inducement to the furnishing such a discourse and accordingly it appeared on Saturday the fifteenth day  of April and continued to be published on the same day in every week for near two years thence following  The profits accruing from the sale of this paper and the subscriptions which from the year he was receiving for the edition of Shakespeare by him proposed were the only known means of his subsistence for a period of near four years and we may suppose them hardly adequate to his wants for upon finding the balance of the account for the dictionary against him he quitted his house in Gough square and took chambers in Gray's inn and Mrs Williams upon this removal fixed herself in lodgings at a boardingschool in the neighbourhood of their former dwelling  About this time he had from a friend who highly esteemed him  Mr Langton of Langton in Lincolnshire the father of his muchbeloved friend Bennet Langton  Esq  mentioned in the codicil his will and husband of the countess dowager of Rothes  the offer of a living of which he might have rendered himself capable by entering into holy orders it was a rectory in a pleasant country and of such a yearly value as might have tempted one in better circumstances than himself to accept it but he had scruples about the duties of the ministerial function that he could not after deliberation overcome  'I have not' said he 'the requisites for the office and I cannot in my conscience shear that flock which I am unable to feed'  Upon conversing with him on that inability which was his reason for declining the offer it was found to be a suspicion of his patience to undergo the fatigue of catechising and instructing a great number of poor ignorant persons  who in religious matters had perhaps every thing to learn  Thus scrupulously did he think of the nature of the ministerial office and thus did he testify the sincerity of those censures which he would sometimes pass on the conduct of the generality of the clergy of his time for though as a body of men he held them in great veneration and was ever ready to defend them against the encroachments of some and the reproaches of others of the ignorant laity he exacted from all who had the cure of souls a punctilious discharge of their duty and held in utter detestation those who renouncing their garb and clerical character affected to appear men of the world  He thought of Dr Clarke whose sermons he valued above all other that he complied too frequently with invitations to dine with persons of high rank his parishioners and spent too much of his time in ceremonious visits differing in this respect from his contemporary Smalridge the elegant Favonius of the Tatler who in the height of his reputation as a preacher was ever ready to visit a sick person in the most obscure alley of Westminster  In the beginning of the year and while the Idler continued to be published an event happened for which it might be imagined he was well prepared the death of his mother who had then attained the age of ninety but he whose mind had acquired no firmness by the contemplation of mortality was as little able to sustain the shock as he would have been had this loss befallen him in his nonage It is conjectured that for many years before her decease she derived almost the whole of her support from this  her dutiful son whose filial piety was ever one of the most distinguishable features in his character  I find in his diary a note of the payment to Mr Allen the printer of six guineas which he had borrowed of him and sent to his dying mother  Report says but rather vaguely that to supply her necessities in her last illness he wrote and made money of his  'Rasselas'  a tale of his invention numbered among the best of his writings and published in the spring of a crisis that gives credit to such a supposition No of the Idler though it pretends to be a letter to the author was written by Johnson himself on occasion of his mother's death and may be supposed to describe as truly as pathetically his sentiments on the separation of friends and relations The fact respecting the writing and publishing the story of Rasselas is that finding the Eastern Tales written by himself in the Rambler and by Hawkesworth in the Adventurer had been well received he had been for some time meditating a fictitious history of a greater extent than any that had appeared in either of those papers which might serve as a vehicle to convey to the world his sentiments of human life and the dispensations of Providence and having digested his thoughts on the subject he obeyed the spur of that necessity which now pressed him and sat down to compose the tale abovementioned laying the scene of it in a country that he had before occasion to contemplate in his translation of Padre Lobo's voyage  As it was written to raise money he did not long delay disposing of it he gave it as I have been told to Mr Baretti to sell to that bookseller who would  give most for it but the sum he got for it is variously reported As none of his compositions have been more applauded than this an examen of it in this place may not be improper and the following may serve till a better shall appear  Considered as a specimen of our language it is scarcely to be paralleled it is written in a style refined to a degree of immaculate purity and displays the whole force of turgid eloquence  But it was composed at a time when no spring like that in the mind of Rasselas urged his narrator when the heavy hand of affliction almost bore him down and the dread of future want haunted him That he should have produced a tale fraught with lively imagery or that he should have painted human life in gay colours could not have been expected he poured out his sorrow in gloomy reflection and being destitute of comfort himself described the world as nearly without it  In a work of such latitude as this where nothing could be impertinent he had an opportunity of divulging his opinion on any point that he had thought on he has therefore formed many conversations on topics that are known to have been subjects of his meditation and has atoned for the paucity of his incidents by such discussions as are seldom attempted by the fabricators of romantic fiction  Admitting that Johnson speaks in the person of the victordisputant we may while he is unveiling the hearts of others gain some knowledge of his own He has in this Abyssinian tale given us what he calls a dissertation on poetry and in it that which appears to  me a recipe for making a poet from which may be inferred what he thought the necessary ingredients and a reference to the passage will tend to corroborate an observation of Mr Garrick's that Johnson's poetical faculty was mechanical and that what he wrote came not from his heart but from his head Imlac the guide of the prince relates to him the events of his life which areThat his father was a wealthy merchant but a man of uncultivated intellects who left the choice of a profession with very little biass to his son The young man was disgusted with trade and inclined to general learning but finding as he says that poetry was considered as the highest learning and regarded with veneration he determined to become a poet Ambition has seldom effected so stupendous a work as that of implanting poetic genius but Imlac was resolved and if we may trust the account of his success his design was not absurd his industry was very commendable he red all the poets of Arabia and Persia and was able to repeat by memory the volumes that are suspended in the mosque of Mecca he then ranged mountains and desarts for images and resemblances and pictured on his mind every tree of the forest and flower of the valley an ample collection drawn from rocks palaces rivulets clouds c stored his mind and with the help of ethics languages and sciences the resolute Imlac who till the age of twenty had lived in ignorance was by dint of mere industry transformed into a distinguished poet  In the course of Imlac's narrative Johnson animadverts on the supposed efficacy of pilgrimages  his argument decides nothing but is conceived in such language that none how well acquainted soever with the book will blame the insertion of it here  'Pilgrimages like many other acts of piety may be reasonable or superstitious according to the principles upon which they are performed Long journeys in search of truth are not commanded Truth such as is necessary to the regulation of life is always found where it is honestly sought Change of place is no natural cause of the increase of piety for it inevitably produces dissipation of mind Yet since men go every day to view the fields where great actions have been performed and return with stronger impressions of the event curiosity of the same kind may naturally dispose us to view that country whence our religion had its beginning and I believe no man surveys those awful scenes without some confirmation of holy resolutions That the Supreme Being may be more easily propitiated in one place than in another is the dream of idle superstition but that some places may operate upon our own minds in an uncommon manner is an opinion which hourly experience will justify He who supposes that his vices may be more successfully combated in Palestine will perhaps find himself mistaken yet he may go thither without folly he who thinks they will be more freely pardoned dishonours at once his reason and religion'  In a following chapter the danger of insanity is the subject of debate and it cannot but excite the pity  of all those who gratefully accept and enjoy Johnson's endeavours to reform and instruct to reflect that the peril he describes he believed impending over him That he was conscious of superior talents will surely not be imputed to vanity how deeply then must he have been depressed by the constant fear that in one moment he might and probably would be not only deprived of his distinguished endowments but reduced to a state little preferable in as much as respects this world to that of brutes He has traced the misery of insanity from its cause to its effect and seems to ascribe it to indulgence of imagination he styles it one of the dangers of solitude and perhaps to this dread and this opinion was his uncommon love of society to be attributed  His superstitious ideas of the state of departed souls and belief in supernatural agency were produced by a mental disease as impossible to be shaken off as corporal pain What it has pleased Omnipotence to inflict we need never seek to excuse but he has provided against the cavils of those who cannot comprehend how a wise can ever appear a weak man by remarking that there is a natural affinity between melancholy and superstition  In characterising this performance it cannot be said that it vindicates the ways of God to man It is a general satire representing mankind as eagerly pursuing what experience should have taught them they can never obtain it exposes the weaknesses even of their laudable affections and propensities and it resolves the mightiest as well as the most trivial of their labours into folly  I wish I were not warranted in saying that this elegant work is rendered by its most obvious moral of little benefit to the reader We would not indeed wish to see the rising generation so unprofitably employed as the prince of Abyssinia but it is equally impolitic to repress all hope and he who should quit his father's house in search of a profession and return unprovided because he could not find any man pleased with his own would need a better justification than that Johnson after speculatively surveying various modes of life had judged happiness unattainable and choice useless  But let those who reading Rasselas in the spring of life are captivated by its author's eloquence and convinced by his perspicacious wisdom that human life and hopes are such as he has depicted them remember that he saw through the medium of adversity The concurrent testimony of ages has it is too true proved that there is no such thing as worldly felicity but it has never been proved that therefore we are miserable Those who look only here for happiness have ever been and ever will be disappointed it is not change of place nor even the unbounded gratification of their wishes that can relieve them but if they bend their attention towards the attainment of that felicity we are graciously promised they will find no such vacuum as distressed Rasselas the discharge of religious and social duties will afford their faculties the occupation he wanted and the wellfounded expectation of future reward will at once stimulate and support them  The tale of Rasselas was written to answer a pressing necessity and was so concluded as to admit of a  continuation and in fact Johnson had meditated a second part in which he meant to marry his hero and place him in a state of permanent felicity but it fared with this resolution as it did with that of Dr Young who in his estimate of human life promised as he had given the dark so in a future publication he would display the bright side of his subject he never did it for he had found out that it had no bright side and Johnson had made much the fame discovery and that in this state of our existence all our enjoyments are fugacious and permanent felicity unattainable  Soon after the publication of Rasselas and while he continued to write the Idler Johnson was tempted to engage in a controversy on a subject with which in the course of his studies he had acquired but little knowledge namely the comparative strength of arches of different forms the occasion of it was that after the passing of the act of parliament for building BlackFriars bridge a variety of designs for it were tendered to the commissioners who after due consideration reduced them to three In two of these designs the construction of the arches was semicircular in the third exhibited by Mr Mylne a Scotsman it was elliptical  Whether Johnson thought that the author of this last proposal as being a native of North Britain merited to be treated as an intruder or that he was induced by better motives to oppose his scheme cannot be determined this at least is certain that he took up the resolution before he was qualified to debate the question for I have it from undoubted  authority that in order thereto he procured from a person eminently skilled in mathematics and the principles of architecture answers to a string of questions drawn up by himself touching the comparative strength of semicircular and elliptical arches These I myself have seen and the answers determine in favour of the semicircular  If the former of the considerations above suggested was at any time or in any degree Johnson's motive for opposing Mr Mylne he ought to have reflected that at a period when we had no better architects than Vanbrugh Hawksmoor  Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor had such ideas of beauty and harmony as have no archetypes in the material world the latter in an evil hour was employed by the commissioners for building fifty new churches as also by a parish in the city St Mary Woolnoth in the reedification of an old one and has left his mark behind him in several parts of this kingdom  James and Kent among us  James and Kent were mere decorators and could do little more than design a saloon a gallery or a screen Kent pretended to historypainting but was after painting an altarpiece or two become so conscious of his deficiency that he strove to render painted staircases unfashionable by dividing them into compartments of stucco ornamented with groups of fruit and flowers with other plastic ornaments He had nevertheless a fine taste in gardening and introduced that style which now prevails in this kingdom and serves for a model to all Europe  Campbell and Gibbs  Campbell and Gibbs were both men of genius the former designed the best house in this kingdom that at Wansted in Essex built by the earl of Castlemain the latter St Martin's church and other edifices that are an honour to his memory  both Scotsmen had adorned this country with some stately and elegant edifices and if the latter was his inducement he should have reflected that his arguments were  not his own and so far as regards symmetry and correspondence of parts how little he was qualified to judge of symmetry and the correspondence of parts whose eye was never capable of comprehending the dome of St Paul's cathedral or the towers of Westminster abbey However armed as he is above said to have been with reasons against Mr Mylne's design he began an attack on it in a letter to the publisher of the Daily Gazetteer inserted in that paper for the first day of December and continued it in the succeeding papers of the eighth and fifteenth of the same month To one or more of these letters answers were published in which it was contended that at Florence there is a bridge that crosses the river Arno of an elliptical form but the argument drawn from thence Johnson had refuted in his first letter by observing that the stability thereof is so much doubted that carts are not permitted to pass over it and that it has stood two hundred years without imitation These and many other arguments as also the opinion of that excellent mathematician Mr Thomas Simpson were not of sufficient weight with the committee for building the bridge to recommend the semicircular arch Mr Mylne's design was preferred and the arches are elliptical  I have already remarked that Johnson was unskilled in the science of architecture and I might have added that he was a stranger to the very rudiments of it He could not else have failed to notice in the edifice here spoken of one of the most egregious errors that ever disgraced a structure of its kind columns disproportionate in the ratio between  their heights and their diameters The proportion of a column is taken from that of the human figure which at a medium is in a man sesquioctave of the head and in a woman sesquinonal The computation of columns by modules or diameters comes to much the same and according to Palladio gives to one of the Doric order the masculine proportion of eight of those measures and to one of the Ionic the feminine of nine  Proportions thus adjusted by nature admit of no deviation whenever that is attempted deformity ensues as is to be seen in the instance before us where we behold a range of Ionic columns level it is true at their bases but rising from their due proportion at the extremities in gradation like the pipes in the front of an organ to the central arch where instead of the proportion of a column they assume that of a candle  Columns thus disproportionate but in a less degree are also to be seen in the portico of the admiraltyoffice designed by Ripley who from a carpenter that kept a shop and also a coffeehouse in Wood street Cheapside by marrying a servant of a minister obtained a seat at the Board of Works    It will perhaps be said that the great elevation of the centrearch required this preposterous elongation of the columns To this it may be answered that proportion is not to be wrested to byepurposes and that where beautiful forms cannot be introduced they must be given up and ornament yield place to convenience It is said that the idea of columns standing on the piers of a bridge was suggested by a design of Piranesi extant among his works but  without an assertion that he assumed the licence here reprobated Should he in any instance be found to have done so the example of a genius so wildly magnificent as his will weigh but little against the practice of Palladio Scamozzi Vignola and let me add the earl of Pembroke the architect of Westminster bridge who in all such emergencies as that insisted on evaded the necessity of violating the rules of their art by rejecting incongruous decorations and trusted to the applause they should acquire by uniting levity and convenience with stability  There are it must be acknowledged persons who are as blind to symmetry and the beauty of forms as others are deaf to the harmony of according sounds who deny that there are any criteria by which we can discriminate beauty from deformity in one subject and consonance from dissonance in the other and who assert that taste is capricious and has no standard and that fancy is its own arbiter Let such enjoy their ignorance while we are engaged in an investigation of the principles into which the pleasures of the eye and ear are resolvable The result of such an enquiry will be a thorough conviction that all of what we understand by the terms symmetry and harmony has its foundation in mathematical ratios and proportions that exist in all the modifications of matter and are but emanations of that power which has ordered all things in number weight and measure  Of these the principal are the equal to the sesquialteral to the sesquitertian to and the duple to answering to the unison the diapente the diatessaron and the diapason the sweetest concords in music    I forbear to remark the lesser errors in the construction of this edifice such as the unwarrantable mutilation of the keystones over the arches and the injudicious position of the entablature of the balustrade those I have pointed out may serve to shew that the great encouragements given of late to the arts of design have hitherto failed to call forth a genius in any degree comparable to those of former ages Jones and Sir Christopher Wren and that the citizens of London in the meridian of its glory having with a view to eternize the memory of a favourite minister erected an edifice in which beauty and symmetry are in vain sought for and called it by his name  It is called Pitt's bridge and the buildings adjacent to it Chatham place  have thereby perpetuated their own disgrace and subjected a whole nation to the reproach of foreigners  Neither the writing of his Rasselas nor the event of his mother's death nor the bridgecontroversy stopped the hand of Johnson nor interrupted the publication of the Idler but the sale of the Universal Chronicle the vehicle that contained it was in some degree obstructed by the practices of those literary depredators who subsist by the labours of others and whose conduct with respect to the Idler the following paper evidently drawn up by Johnson will explain  'London January Advertisement The proprietors of the paper entitled  'The Idler'  having found that those essays are inserted in the newspapers and magazines with so little regard to justice or decency that the Universal Chronicle in which they first appear is not always mentioned think it  necessary to declare to the publishers of those collections that however patiently they have hitherto endured these injuries made yet more injurious by contempt they have now determined to endure them no longer They have already seen essays for which a very large price is paid transferred with the most shameless rapacity into the weekly or monthly compilations and their right at least for the present alienated from them before they could themselves be said to enjoy it But they would not willingly be thought to want tenderness even for men by whom no tenderness hath been shewn The past is without remedy and shall be without resentment But those who have been thus busy with their sickles in the fields of their neighbours are henceforward to take notice that the time of impunity is at an end Whoever shall without our leave lay the hand of rapine upon our papers is to expect that we shall vindicate our due by the means which justice prescribes and which are warranted by the immemorial prescriptions of honourable trade We shall lay hold in our turn on their copies degrade them from the pomp of wide margin and diffuse typography contract them into a narrow space and sell them at an humble price yet not with a view of growing rich by confiscations for we think not much better of money got by punisshment than by crimes we shall therefore when our losses are repaid give what profit shall remain to the  Magdalens  for we know not who can be more properly taxed for the support of penitent prostitutes than prostitutes in whom there yet appears neither penitence nor shame'  He continued this paper to the extent of one hundred and three numbers and on Saturday the fifth day of April closed it with an essay containing a solemn and very affecting contemplation on the words  this is the last  in various significations The concluding paragraph seems to have been written under the pressure of that melancholy which almost incessantly afflicted him heightened perhaps by the approach of a season of the year to Christians the most solemn The reflections contained in it are very serious and so elegantly expressed that in the hope that the perusal of it will not prove contagious to the reader I here give it at length  'As the last Idler is published in that solemn week which the Christian world has always set apart for the examination of the conscience the review of life the extinction of earthly desires and the renovation of holy purposes I hope that my readers are already disposed to view every incident with seriousness and improve it by meditation and that when they see this series of trifles brought to a conclusion they will consider that by outliving the Idler they have passed weeks months and years which are now no longer in their power that an end must in time be put to every thing great as to every thing little that to life must come its last hour and to this system of being its last day the hour at which probation ceases and repentance will be vain the day in which every work of the hand and imagination of the heart shall be brought to judgment and an everlasting futurity shall be determined by the past'  The Idler taken as the title of a series of moral and oeconomical essays is a designation that imports little or rather its most obvious meaning is a bad one Johnson was at a loss for a fitter but he could hit on no one that had not been preoccupied He chose an irony and meant that his readers should understand by it just the reverse of what it signified and in this his intention he was in little danger of being mistaken or being charged with idleness by any of those whom he was labouring by all the powers of reason and eloquence to make wiser and better  The plan and conduct of the Idler resembles so nearly that of the Rambler and the Adventurer that what has been said of each of those publications might serve for a character of this saving that in this latter admission is given to a greater number of papers calculated to entertain the mind with pleasing fictions humorous characters and varied representations of familiar life than is to be found in either of the two former the general effect whereof is delight too soon interrupted by their shortness The second number of the Idler contains an invitation to correspondents and it had the assistance of other hands but I know but of three papers that can with certainty be said to have been written by any other than Johnson himself one of the three is No by Mr Langton the other two No and are on the subject of painting and in an eveninghour when his pencil was at rest were composed by Sir Joshua Reynolds And here let me take notice that in the publication of the Idler at least when it was collected into volumes Johnson and  Newbery were jointadventurers and that they divided equally the profits arising from the sale thereof  Of these essays as also the Rambler and those in the Adventurer which Johnson wrote little remains to be remarked except that notwithstanding the depth of thinking which they display and the nervous and elegant style in which they are penned they were extemporaneous compositions and hardly ever underwent a revision  Of his facility in composition and the rapidity with which he wrote for the press here follow a few instances Savage's life containing a hundred and eighty octavo pages was the work of thirtysix hours He was wont to furnish for the Gentleman's Magazine three columns of the debates in an hour written as myself can attest in a character that almost any one might read His preface to  'The Preceptor'  and his  'Vision of Theodore'  were each the work of one sitting as was also the first seventy lines of his translation of the tenth satire of Juvenal entitled  'The vanity of human Wishes'  and what is almost incredible he never red his Rasselas but in the proofs which came to him from the press for correction  before they were sent to the press The original manuscripts of the Rambler have passed through my hands and by the perusal of them I am warranted to say as was said of Shakespeare by the players of his time that he never blotted out a line and I believe without the risque of that retort which Ben Jonson made to them  'Would he had blotted out a thousand'  Another circumstance worthy of notice is that in the portraits of singular characters that occur in the papers written by Johnson the painting is so strong and lively that some persons then living looking on them as resemblances of themselves actually  charged him with an intention to render them ridiculous and were hardly appeased by his assurances that he copied no particular subject but drew from archetypes which his observation had furnished and his imagination had improved  Johnson was now become so well known and had by the Rambler and other of his writings given such evidences not only of great abilities and of his skill in human life and manners but of a sociable and benevolent disposition that many became desirous of his acquaintance and to this they were farther tempted by the character he had acquired of delighting in conversation and being free and communicative in his discourse He had removed about the beginning of the year to chambers two doors down the InnerTemple lane and I have been told by his neighbour at the corner that during the time he dwelt there more enquiries were made at his shop for Mr Johnson than for all the inhabitants put together of both the Inner and Middle Temple This circumstance in his life leads me to mention that Richardson possessed but in a less degree the like powers of attraction but they operated chiefly on young females who being desirous of instruction in the duties of life were permitted by their parents and friends to visit and receive from him such lessons of prudence as he was ever ready and well qualified to give them and it is well known that many ingenious young women who resorted to his house as to an academy for tuition became so improved by his conversation and his extemporary commentaries on his own writings as afterwards to make a considerable figure  in the literary world  See a poem in Fawkes and Woty's  'Poetical calendar'  intitled  'The Feminead'  written by the Rev Mr Duncombe late of Canterbury deceased  And here let me observe that the benefits of oral instruction joined with the perusal of such authors as we now put into female hands may be estimated by the degree of mental improvement at which the sex is at this day arrived which as Johnson once remarked to me on receiving a lady's letter is so great that in that kind of composition we who were their teachers may learn of them  From this propensity to discursive communication in which Johnson and Richardson resembled each other nothing more is to be understood than that both took pleasure in that interchange of sentiments and opinions which renders conversation instructive and delightful for in other respects they were men of very different endowments and tempers Richardson being bred to a mechanic occupation had no learning nor more reading than was sufficient to enable him to form a style easy and intelligible and a little raised above that of vulgar narrative His sentiments were his own and of this he was so sensible and also of the originality and importance of many of them that he would ever be talking of his writings and the words sentiment and sentimentality became not only a part of the cant of his school but were adopted by succeeding writers and have been used to recommend to some readers sentimental journies sentimental letters sentimental sermons and a world of trash  which but for this silly epithet would never have attracted notice  Richardson's conversation was of the preceptive kind but it wanted the diversity of Johnson's and had no intermixture of wit or humour Richardson could never relate a pleasant story and hardly relish one told by another he was ever thinking of his own writings and listening to the praises which with an emulous profusion his friends were incessantly bestowing on them he would scarce enter into free conversation with any one that he thought had not red  'Clarissa'  or  'Sir Charles Grandison'  and at best he could not be said to be a companionable man  I once travelled with him in the Fulham stagecoach in which at my getting in I found him seated I learned by somewhat he szid to the coachman who he was and made some essays towards conversation but he seemed disinclined to any There was one other passenger who being a female I was in common civility bound to take notice of but my male companion I left to indulge himself in a reverie which neither he nor I interrupted by the utterance of a single word and lasted till he was set down at his house on Parson's green He had the courtesy to ask us in but as our acquaintance had but lately commenced and had received but little improvement in our journey the civility was declined    Those who were unacquainted with Richardson and had red his books were led to believe that they exhibited a picture of his own mind and that his temper and domestic behaviour could not but correspond with that refined morality which they inculcate but in this they were deceived He was austere in the government of his family and issued his orders to some of his servants in writing only His nearest female relations in the presence of strangers were mutes and  seemed to me in a visit I once made him to have been disciplined in the school of Ben Jonson's Morose whose injunction to his servant was  'Answer me not but with your leg'  In short they appeared to have been taught to converse with him by signs and it was too plain to me that on his part the most frequent of them were frowns and gesticulations importing that they should leave his presence I have heard it said that he was what is called a nervous man and how far nervosity with so good an understanding as he is allowed to have possessed will excuse a conduct so opposite to that philanthropy which he laboured to inculcate I cannot say his benevolence might have taken another direction and in other instances be very strong for I was once a witness to his putting into the hand of Mr Whiston the bookseller ten guineas for the relief of one whom a sudden accident had made a widow  Johnson's mind was never occupied on trifles his speculations were grand and noble his reading various and extensive and on some subjects profound As he professed always to speak in the best and most correct phrase rejecting all such common and vulgar combinations of speech as are in use only till others equally affected and insignificant are invented his conversationstyle bore a great resemblance to that of his writings so that in his common discourse he might seem to incur the censure which bishop Burnet casts on the lord chancellor Nottingham of being too eloquent but so far were his hearers from thinking so that many wished for the power of retaining as well the colloquial form as the substance of his conversations  and some there were who to that end in imitation of the Colloquia Mensalia of Luther and the Tabletalk of Selden not to say of the books in  ana  These are the Menagiana Parrhasiana Huetiana Scaligeriana Naudaeana Patiniana Poggiana Thuana Perroniana Pithaeana Colomesiana Sorbetiana Valesiana and others less known  as they are called made commonplaces of his sayings his precepts and his apophthegms but the want of judgment in the selection of them has rendered most of the collections of this kind that I have ever seen of little worth  Gesticular mimicry and buffoonery he hated and would often huff Garrick for exercising it in his presence but of the talent of humour he had an almost enviable portion To describe the nature of this faculty as he was wont to display it in his hours of mirth and relaxation I must say that it was ever of that arch and dry kind which lies concealed under the appearance of gravity and which acquiesces in an error for the purpose of refuting it Thus in the Rambler No he tells his readers very gravely that it is one among many reasons for which he purposes to entertain his countrymen that he hopes not much to tire those whom he shall not happen to please and if he is not commended for the beauty of his works to be at least pardoned for their brevity  'But whether' adds he 'my expectations are most fixed on pardon or praise I think it not necessary to discover'  And in the Idler No he suggests consolation against the dread of an imaginary evil founded on false philosophy by admitting that  though certain it is remote The passage would be injured by contraction and I therefore give it at length  'Many philosophers imagine that the elements themselves may in time be exhausted that the sun by shining long will effuse all its light and that by the continual waste of aqueous particles the whole earth will at last become a sandy desart  'I would not advise my readers to disturb themselves by contriving how they shall live without light and water for the days of universal thirst and perpetual darkness are at a great distance The ocean and the sun will last our time and we may leave posterity to shifr for themselves  'But if the stores of nature are limited much more narrow bounds must be set to the modes of life and mankind may want a moral or amusing paper many years before they shall be deprived of drink or daylight This want which to the busy and inventive may seem easily remediable by some substitute or other the whole race of idlers will feel with all the sensibility that all such torpid animals can suffer'  A friend of his used often to visit him who though a man of learning and great good sense had a style of conversing so peculiarly eloquent and verbose as to be sometimes unintelligible Johnson had a mind one day to give me a specimen of it and assuming his manner he in a connected speech on a familiar subject uttered a succession of sentences in language resembling the style of metaphysics but though fluent so obscured by parentheses and other involutions  that I was unable to collect from it a single idea After he had for five minutes continued this gibberish he said  'This is the manner in which * * * * entertains me whenever he comes here'  In the same vein of humour he once ridiculed Hervey's Meditations on a Flowergarden and other subjects in the following extemporaneous reflections on a pudding  'Let us seriously reflect on what a pudding is composed of It is composed of flour that once waved in the golden grain and drank the dews of the morningof milk pressed from the swelling udder by the gentle hand of the beauteous milkmaid whose beauty and innocence might have recommended a worse draught who whilst she stroked the udder indulged no ambitious thoughts of dwelling in palaces and formed no schemes for the destruction of her fellowcreaturesmilk which is drawn from the cow that useful animal that eats the grass of the field and supplles us with that which made the greatest part of the food of that age which the poets have agreed to call golden  'It is made with an egg that miracle of nature which the theoretical Burnet has compared to creationan egg that contains water within its beautiful smooth surface and an unformed mass which by the incubation of the parent becomes a regular animal furnished with bones and sinews and covered with feathers  'Let us considercan there be any thing wanting to complete this meditation on a puddingif more  is wanting more may be found It contains salt which preserves the sea from putrefaction salt which is made the image of intellectual excellence contributes to the formation of a pudding'  He excelled also in the talent of burlesque versification and upon occasion of a discourse at Sir Joshua Reynold's on Dr Percy's  'Reliques of ancient English poetry'  in which the beautiful simplicity of many of the ballads therein contained was remarked with some exaggeration Johnson contended that what was called simplicity was in truth inanity and to illustrate his argument and ridicule that kind of poetry uttered the following impromptu  As with my hat upon my head  I walk'd along the Strand  I there did meet another man  With his hat in his hand  And it being at a teaconversation he addressing himself to Miss Reynolds went on rhyming thus  I pray thee gentle Renny dear  That thou wilt give to me  With cream and sugar temper'd well  Another dish of tea  Nor fear that I my gentle maid  Shall long detain the cup  When once unto the bottom I  Have drank the liquor up  Yet hear at last this mournful truth  Nor hear it with a frown  Thou can'st not make the tea so fast  As I can gulp it down  With these powers of instructing and delighting those with whom he conversed it is no wonder that the acquaintance of Johnson was sought by many and I will not say either that he set so great a value on his time as not to be accessible to all who wished for the pleasure of it or that his vanity was not gratified by the visits of bishops of courtiers senators scholars travellers and women  In his conversation with the last in this enumeration he had such a felicity as would put vulgar gallantry out of countenance Of the female mind he conceived a higher opinion than many men and though he was never suspected of a blameable intimacy with any individual of them had a great esteem for the sex The defect in his powers of sight rendered him totally insensible to the charms of beauty but he knew that beauty was the attribute of the sex and treated all women with such an equable complacency as flattered every one into a belief that she had her share of that or some more valuable endowment In his discourses with them his compliments had ever a neat and elegant turn they were never direct but always implied the merit they were intended to attest  In this enjoyment of himself and his friends his engagements to the public were forgotten his critical talents lay dormant and not any nor all of those  who wished to see his Shakespeare could rouse his attention to the prosecution of that work yet was he ready at the call of almost any one to assist either by correction or by a preface or dedication in the publication of works not his own Dr Madden so wellknown by his premiums for the encouragement of Protestant workingschools in Ireland and other instances of beneficence in favour of that country in the year published a panegyrical poem on arch bishop Boulter some years after being minded to republish it he submitted it to Johnson's correction and I found among his books a copy of the poem with a note in a spare leaf thereof purporting that the author had made him a visit and for a very few remarks and alterations of it had presented him with ten guineas Such casual emoluments as these Johnson frequently derived from his profession of an author For the dedication to his present majesty of Adams's book on the use of the globes he was as himself informed me gratified with a present of a very curious meteorological instrument of a new and ingenious construction  About this time as it is supposed he for sundry beneficed clergymen that requested him composed pulpit discourses  The practice of preaching sermons composed by others is now become so common that many of the clergy scruple not to avow it and think themselves justified by the authority of Mr Addison who in one of his Spectators has very incautiously given countenance thereto and put into the mouths not only of such clergymen as are  minus idonei  but of such as contrary to their engagement at their ordination instead of being  diligent in  are negligent of  such studies as help to the knowledge of the scriptures  a perpetual apology for ignorance and idleness for as long as they chuse to say there are better discourses extant or to be procured than they are able to make the excuse will hold them and accordingly many are not ashamed to claim the benefit of it who have nothing to plead but what is an aggravation of their neglect to which it may be added that as it is an assumption of the merit of another the practice is unjust and as its leads to a belief of that which is not true in a high degree immoral  and for these he made no scruple of confessing he was paid his price I am informed was a moderate one a guinea and such was his notion  of justice that having been paid he considered them so absolutely the property of the purchaser as to renounce all claim to them He reckoned that he had written about forty sermons but except as to some knew not in what hands they were  'I have' said he 'been paid for them and have no right to enquire about them  Myself have heard in the church of St Margaret Westminster sundry sermons which I and many others judged by the sentiments style and method to be of his composition one in particular Johnson being present The next visit I made him I told him that I had seen him at St Margaret's on the preceding Sunday and that it was he who then preached He heard me and did not deny either assertion which if either had not been true he certainly would have done In his diary I find the following note  ' Sept Concio pro Tayloro'  '  I have now brought him to the year the fiftyfirst of his age He had nothing to depend on for subsistence but the labour of his brain and that apprehension touching the duration of his rational powers which throughout his life haunted him increased the terrors of approaching age The accession of our present gracious sovereign to the throne and the bounty exercised by him towards Johnson dispelled this gloomy prospect and placed him in such a state of affluence as  his utmost industry would hardly ever have enabled him to arrive at Lord Bute was the minister at the time and the person employed to notify to Johnson his majesty's intention to reward him for his literary labours with a pension of l a year was his friend Mr Murphy Upon receiving the news Johnson was in doubt what answer to return being perhaps disturbed with the reflection that whatever he might deserve from the public he had very little claim to the favour of any of the descendants of the house of Hanover and desired that Mr Murphy would give him till next day to deliberate upon a message so unexpected At the end thereof he signified his willingness to accept it  It was by Johnson and his friends thought fit that he should return thanks for this distinguishing mark of the royal favour and that lord Bute who may be supposed to have been instrumental in procuring it was the proper person to convey them Accordingly he waited on his lordship for the purpose and being admitted to him testified his sense of the obligation but having done this he thought he had done enough and never after could be prevailed on to knock at his door  He had now suffered himself to be enrolled in the list of pensioners and was become obnoxious to the censures of those who looking upon a perpetual enmity to government and its ministers as a proof of public virtue endeavoured to have it believed that all favours dispensed by the crown even when meant as the rewards of merit or the encouragement of learning of ingenuity or industry were but the  wages of iniquity Johnson it is true had laid himself open to reproach by his interpretation of the word Pension in his dictionary written it is evident at a time when his political prejudices were strongest and he found himself in a predicament similar to that of Dr Sherlock who at the revolution was a nonjuror to king William but after deliberating on his refusal as a case of conscience took the side that made for his interest but against his reputation But who except the Great Searcher of Hearts can know that in the case of Sherlock or Johnson either made a sacrifice of his conscience Or seeing that the grant of Johnson's pension was confessedly unconditional and bound him neither to the renunciation of any of his political principles nor the exercise of his pen in the defence of any set of men or series of measures who will have the face to say that his acceptance of it was criminal or that it was in the power of any one to pervert the integrity of a man who in the time of his necessity had from scruples of his own raising declined the offer of a valuable ecclesiastical preferment and thereby renounced an independent provision for the whole of his life  It is yet difficult if not impossible to justify Johnson both in the interpretation given by him of the word Pension and in his becoming a pensioner in one instance or the other he was wrong and either his discretion or integrity must be given up in the former he seems in some of his actions to have been wanting in the latter never not only charity but reason therefore directs us in the opinion we are to form of an act which has drawn censure on his conduct  and proves nothing more than that he was not equally wise at all times  Some of Johnson's friends and all his enemies would have been glad had he imitated the conduct of Andrew Marvell who in the reign of Cha II upon the offer of any post under the government that would please him and of a thousand pounds in money made him in a message from the king by the earl of Danby at a time when he wanted a guinea refused both But Johnson had no reason to practice such selfdenial Marvell to be grateful must have deserted his principles and acquiesced in the measures of a corrupt court Johnson on the contrary was in no danger during such a reign as is the present of being required to make a sacrifice of his conscience and being thus at liberty he accepted the bounty of his sovereign    The addition of three hundred pounds a year to what Johnson was able to earn by the ordinary exercise of his talents raised him to a state of comparative affluence and afforded him the means of assisting many whose real or pretended wants had formerly excited his compassion He now practised a rule which he often recommended to his friends always to go abroad with a quantity of loose money to give to beggars imitating therein though I am confident without intending it that good but weak man old Mr Whiston whom I have seen distributing in the streets of London money to beggars on each hand of him till his pocket was nearly exhausted  He had early in his life been a dabbler in physic and laboured under some secret bodily infirmities that gave him occasion once to say to me that he knew not what it was to be totally free from pain He now drew into a closer intimacy with him a man with whom he had been acquainted from the year one of the lowest practitioners in the art of  healing that ever sought a livelihood by it him he consulted in all that related to his health and made so necessary to him as hardly to be able to live without him  The name of this person was Robert Levett An account of him is given in the Gentleman's Magazine for February an earlier than that I have now lying before me in a letter from a person in the country to Johnson written in answer to one in which he had desired to be informed of some particulars respecting his friend Levett then lately deceased The substance of this information is as follows  He was born at Kirk Ella a parish about five miles distant from Hull and lived with his parents till about twenty years of age He had acquired some knowledge of the Latin language and had a propensity to learning which his parents not being able to gratify he went to live as a shopman with a woollendraper at Hull with him he stayed two years during which time he learned from a neighbour of his master somewhat of the practice of physic at the end thereof he came to London with a view possibly to improve himself in that profession but by some strange accident was led to pursue another course and became steward or some other upper servant to the then lord Cardigan or Cadogan and having saved some money he took a resolution to travel and visited France and Italy for the purpose as his letters mention of gaining experience in physic and returning to London with a valuable library which he had collected abroad placed one of his brothers apprentice to a mathematicalinstrument maker and provided for the education of another After this he went to Paris  and for improvement attended the hospitals in that city At the end of five years he returned to England and taking lodgings in the house of an attorney in Northumberland court near Charing cross he became a practicer of physic The letter adds that he was about seventyeight at the time of his death  The account of Levett in the Gentleman's Magazine is anonymous I nevertheless insert it verbatim together with a letter of Johnson's to Dr Lawrence notifying his death  'Mr Levett though an Englishman by birth became early in life a waiter at a coffeehouse in Paris The surgeons who frequented it finding him of an inquisitive turn and attentive to their conversation made a purse for him and gave him some instructions in their art They afterwards furnished him with the means of other knowledge by procuring him free admission to such lectures in pharmacy and anatomy as were read by the ablest professors of that period Hence his introduction to a business which afforded him a continual though slender maintenance Where the middle part of his life was spent is uncertain He resided however above twenty years under the roof of Johnson who never wished him to be regarded as an inferior or treated him like a dependent  Dr Johnson has frequently observed that Levett was indebted to him for nothing more than houseroom his share in a penny loaf at breakfast and now and then a dinner on a Sunday  He breakfasted with the doctor every morning and perhaps was seen no more by him till midnight Much of the day was employed in attendance on his patients who were  chiefly of the lowest rank of tradesmen The remainder of his hours he dedicated to Hunter's lectures and to as many different opportunities of improvement as he could meet with on the same gratuitous conditions  "All his medical knowledge" said Johnson "and it is not inconsiderable  He had acted for many years in the capacity of surgeon and apothecary to Johnson under the direction of Dr Lawrence  was obtained through the ear Though he buys books he seldom looks into them or discovers any power by which he can be supposed to judge of an author's merit"  'Before he became a constant inmate of the doctor's house he married when he was near sixty a woman of the town who had persuaded him notwithstanding their place of congress was a smallcoal shed in Fetter lane that she was nearly related to a man of fortune but was injuriously kept by him out of large possessions It is almost needless to add that both parties were disappointed in their views If Levett took her for an heiress who in time might be rich she regarded him as a physician already in considerable practiceCompared with the marvels of this transaction as Johnson himself declared when relating them the tales in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments seem familiar occurrences Never was infant more completely duped than our hero He had not been married four months before a writ was taken out against him for debts incurred by his wifeHe was secreted and his friend then procured him a protection from a foreign minister In a short time afterwards she ran away  from him and was tried providentially in his opinion for picking pockets at the Old Bailey Her husband was with difficulty prevented from attending the court in the hope she would be hanged She pleaded her own cause and was acquitted a separation between this illstarred couple took place and Dr Johnson then took Levett home where he continued till his death which happened suddenly without pain Jan His vanity in supposing that a young woman of family and fortune should be enamoured of him Dr Johnson thought deserved some checkAs no relations of his were known to Dr Johnson he advertised for them In the course of a few weeks an heir at law appeared and ascertained his title to what effects the deceased had left behind him  'Levett's character was rendered valuable by repeated proof of honesty tenderness and gratitude to his benefactor as well as by an unwearied diligence in his professionHis single failing was an occasional departure from sobriety Johnson would observe he was perhaps the only man who ever became intoxicated through motives of prudence He reflected that if he refused the gin or brandy offered him by some of his patients he could have been no gainer by their cure as they might have had nothing else to bestow on him This habit of taking a fee in whatever shape it was exhibited could not be put off by advice or admonition of any kind He would swallow what he did not like nay what he knew would injure him rather than go home with an idea that his skill had been exerted without recompence  "Had said  Johnson all his patients maliciously combined to reward him with meat and strong liquors instead of money he would either have burst like the dragon in the Apocrypha through repletion or been scorched up like Portia by swallowing fire"  But let not from hence an imputation of rapaciousness be fixed upon him Though he took all that was offered him he demanded nothing from the poor nor was known in any instance to have enforced the payment of even what was justly his due  'His person was middlesized and thin his visage swarthy adust and corrugated His conversation except on professional subjects barren When in deshabille he might have been mistaken for an alchemist whose complexion had been hurt by the fumes of the crucible and whose clothes had suffered from the sparks of the furnace  'Such was Levett whose whimsical frailty if weighed against his good and useful qualities was  "A floating atom dust that falls unheeded  "Into the adverse scale nor shakes the balance"  IRENE  To this character I here add as a supplement to it a dictum of Johnson respecting Levett viz that his external appearance and behaviour were such that he disgusted the rich and terrified the poor  But notwithstanding all these offensive particulars Johnson whose credulity in some instances was as great as his incredulity in others conceived of him as of a skilful medical professor and thought himself  happy in having so near his person one who was to him not solely a physician a surgeon or an apothecary but all In extraordinary cases he however availed himself of the assistance of his valued friend Dr Lawrence a man of whom in respect of his piety learning and skill in his profession it may almost be said the world was not worthy inasmuch as it suffered his talents for the whole of his life to remain in a great measure unemployed and himself to end his days in sorrow and obscurity  Of this person with whom I was for many years acquainted but who is now no more gratitude for the benefits which myself and one most dear to me have derived from his skill and attention obliges me to speak with reverence and respect He was a native of Hampshire and having ended his studies at Oxford came to London about the year at which time Dr Frank Nicholls had attained great reputation for skill in anatomy To complete them he became a pupil of his in that branch of medical science and upon Nicholls's discontinuing to read lectures therein which he had for several years done with great applause Dr Lawrence took them up and had many hearers till Hunter a surgeon arrived from Scotland who settling in London became his rival in the same practice and having the advantage of Dr Lawrence in his manner of enunciating together with the assistance and support of all his countrymen in this kingdom and moreover being a man whose skill in his art was equal to his pretensions he became a favourite with the leading men in the practice of physic and in a few winters drew to him such a resort of pupils as induced  Dr Lawrence to give up lecturing and betake himself to the general exercise of his profession  In his endeavours to attain to eminence it was his misfortune to fail he was above those arts by which popularity is acquired and had besides some personal defects and habits which stood in his way a vacuity of countenance very unfavourable to an opinion of his learning or sagacity and certain convulsive motions of the head and features that gave pain to the beholders and drew off attention to all that he said  It will hardly be believed how much such particularities as these obstruct the progress of one who is to make his way in a profession a stammering or a bad articulation spoil an orator and a disgusting appearance hurts a physician Pemberton the Gresham professor a great man in his time was consigned to indigence by a habit of distorting the muscles of his face which was become irresistible    He delighted much in naval architecture and was able with his own hands and a variety of tools of his own contrivance to form a model of a ship of war of any rate first framing it with ribs and such other timbers as are requisite in a ship for service and afterwards covering it with planks of the thickness of a halfcrown piece and the breadth of about an inch which he fastened to the ribs with wooden pins of a proportionable size and in this manner of working he completed many such models elegantly wrought and most beautiful in their forms He was also a lover of music and was able to play his part in concert on the violoncello  He had a younger brother named Charles a solicitor of great practice who also played on the violoncello and having been a pupil on that instrument of Caporale was the best performer on it of any gentleman in England About the year I was used to meet both the brothers at a tavern in Gracechurch street where was a private concert to which none but such as could join in it were admitted Many of those who frequented it were great masters namely Mr Stanley who played the first violin the above Sig Caporale Vincent the hautboy player and Balicourt who performed on the German flute the rest were organists and gentlemen performers  till hindered by deafness a disorder  that came upon him about the middle of his life and at length drove him to seek a retreat from the world and all its cares at Canterbury where about the year he died To console him under some family disappointments Johnson addressed to him a fine Latin ode which is inserted in his works  He wrote the life of his friend Dr Nicholls in very elegant Latin but it was never published his sole design in printing it being to gratify those of his own profession In the same language he wrote the life of Dr William Harvey prefixed to an edition of his works published by the college of physicians in in one volume to  The sincere and lasting friendship that subsisted between Johnson and Levett may serve to shew that although a similarity of dispositions and qualities has a tendency to beget affection or something very nearly resembling it it may be contracted and subsist where this inducement is wanting for hardly were ever two men less like each other in this respect than were they Levett had not an understanding capable of comprehending the talents of Johnson the mind of Johnson was therefore as to him a blank and Johnson had the eye of his mind been more penetrating than it  was could not discern what did not exist any particulars in Levett's character that at all resembled his own He had no learning and consequently was an unfit companion for a learned man and though it may be said that having lived some years abroad he must have seen and remarked many things that would have afforded entertainment in the relation this advantage was counterbalanced by an utter inability for continued conversation taciturnity being one of the most obvious features in his character the consideration of all which particulars almost impels me to say that Levett admired Johnson because others admired him and that Johnson in pity loved Levett because few others could find any thing in him to love  And here I cannot forbear remarking that almost throughout his life poverty and distressed circumstances seemed to be the strongest of all recommendations to his favour When asked by one of his most intimate friends how he could bear to be surrounded by such necessitous and undeserving people as he had about him his answer was  'If I did not assist them no one else would and they must be lost for want'  Among many others whom he thus patronized was a worthless fellow a dancingmaster by profession and an assistant in teaching to the famous Noverre the favourite of Mr Garrick This man notwithstanding the nature of his employment which was a genteel one and led to no such connections delighted in the company and conversation of marshal'scourt attornies and of bailiffs and their followers and others of a lower class sharpers and swindlers who when they had made  him drunk would get him to sign notes and engagements of various kinds which he not being able to discharge they had him arrested upon and this was so frequently the case that much of his time was passed in confinement His wife through Mrs Williams got at Johnson and told him her tale which was that her husband was at that instant detained for a small debt in a spunginghouse and he conceiving it to be a piteous one and an additional proof that in human life the evil accidents outnumber the good sent her to me for advice I heard her story and learned from it that all the merit of the fellow lay in his heels that he had neither principle nor discretion and in short was a cully the dupe of every one that would make him drunk I therefore dismissed her with a message to Johnson to this effect that her husband made it impossible for his friends to help him and must submit to his destiny When I next saw Johnson I told him that there seemed to be as exact a fitness between the character of this man and his associates as is between the web of a spider and the wings of a fly and I could not but think he was born to be cheated Johnson seemed to acquiesce in my opinion but I believe before that had set him at liberty by paying the debt  Another of Johnson's distressed friends was Mr Edmund Southwell a younger brother of Thomas lord Southwell of the kingdom of Ireland This gentleman having no patrimony was in his younger days a cornet of horse but having in a duel into which he was forced slain his antagonist he quitted the service and trusted to Providence for a support  He was a man of wonderful parts of lively and entertaining conversation and well acquainted with the world he was also a brother in affliction with Johnson that is to say he laboured under a depression or mind occasioned by the misadventure abovementioned that often approached to insanity Being without employment his practice was to wander about the streets of London and call in at such coffeehouses for instance the Smyrna and Cocoatree in PallMall and Child's and Batson's in the city as were frequented by men of intelligence or where any thing like conversation was going forward in these he found means to make friends from whom he derived a precarious support In the city he was so well known and so much beloved and pitied that many by private donations relieved his wants In particular Sir Robert Ladbroke an alderman thereof and a man of opulence made him frequent presents of money to supply his necessities and Mr Bates the master of the Queen'sarms tavern in St Paul's churchyard suffered him as often as he pleased to add to an ideal account subsisting between them the expence of a dinner A gentleman of great worth in the city who knew and pitied his distresses procured unknown to him from a lady famous for her beneficence a pension of a hundred pounds a year which he lived but few years to receive  Johnson was a great lover of penitents and of all such men as in their conversation made professions of piety of this man he would say that he was one of the most pious of all his acquaintance but in this as he frequently was in the judgment he formed of  others he was mistaken It is possible that Southwell might in his conversation express such sentiments of religion and moral obligation as served to shew that he was not an infidel but he seldom went sober to bed and as seldom rose from it before noon  He was also an admirer of such as he thought wellbred men What was his notion of good breeding ould never learn If it was not courtesy and affability it could to him be nothing for he was an incompetent judge of graceful attitudes and motions and of the ritual of behaviour Of lord Southwell the brother of the above person and of Tom Hervey a profligate worthless man the author of the letter to Sir Thomas Hanmer and who had nothing in his external appearance that could in the least recommend him he was used to say they were each of them a model for the first man of quality in the kingdom In this method of estimating behaviour he seemed to think that goodbreeding is a faculty which like fencing dancing and other bodily exercises must be learned before they can be practised whereas it is obvious that this quality is nothing more than artificial benevolence and that that politeness which it is the employment of the instructors of youth to teach is but a substitute for those dispositions of mind which whoever possesses and takes care to cultivate will have very little need of foreign assistance in the forming of his manners  He once mentioned to me a saying of Dr Nicholls and highly commended it viz that it  was a point of wisdom to form intimacies and to choose for our friends only persons of known worth and integrity and that to do so had been the rule of his life It is therefore difficult to account for the conduct of Johnson in the choice of many of his associates and particularly of those who when his circumstances became easy he suffered to intrude on him Of these he had some at bed and board who had elbowed through the world and subsisted by lying begging and shifting all which he knew but seemed to think never the worse of them In his endeavours to promote the interests of people of this class he in some instances went such lengths as were hardly consistent with that integrity which he manifested on all other occasions for he would frequently by letters recommend those to credit who could obtain it by no other means and thereby enabled them to contract debts which he had good reason to suspect they neither could nor ever would pay  These connections exposed him to trouble and incessant solicitation which he bore well enough but his inmates were enemies to his peace and occasioned him great disquiet the jealousy that subsisted among them rendered his dwelling irksome to him and he seldom approached it after an evening's conversation abroad but with the dread of finding it a scene of discord and of having his ears filled with the complaints of Mrs Williams of Frank's neglect of his duty and inattention to the interests of his master and of Frank against Mrs Williams for the authority she assumed over him and exercised with an unwarrantable severity Even those intruders who had  taken shelter under his roof and who in his absence from home brought thither their children found cause to murmur their provision of food was scanty or their dinners ill dressed all which he chose to endure rather than put an end to their clamours by ridding his house of such thankless and troublesome guests Nay so insensible was he of the ingratitude of those whom he suffered thus to hang on him and among whom he may be said to have divided an income which was little more than sufficient for his own support that he would submit to reproach and personal affront from some of them even Levett would sometimes insult him and Mrs Williams in her paroxysms of rage has been known to drive him from her presence  Who that reflects on Johnson's pusillanimity in these instances can reconcile it to that spirit which prompted him or with those endowments which enabled him to maintain a superiority over all with whom he conversed or to that seeming ferocity of temper that gave occasion to some to consider him as an animal not to be approached without terror or account for the inconsistency abovenoted otherwise than by resolving it into those principles that dictated patience under all the provocations of a female tongue to Socrates In truth there was more asperity in his manner of expression than in his natural disposition for I have heard that in many instances and in some with tears in his eyes he has apologized to those whom he had offended by contradiction or roughness of behaviour  To this inconsistency of character it must be imputed that he failed to attract reverence and respect  from those who lived in greatest intimacy with him There was wanting in his conduct and behaviour that dignity which results from a regular and orderly course of action and by an irresistible power commands esteem He could not be said to be a stayed man nor so to have adjusted in his mind the balance of reason and passion as to give occasion to say what may be observed of some men that all they do is just fit and right and although he was strict and even punctilious in the practice of the great duties of morality he trusted but little to his domestic conduct to his method of employing his time and governing his family for the good opinion he wished the world to entertain of him but in these particulars gave way to the love of ease and to selfindulgence little regarding in his own practice those counsels of prudence those oeconomical maxims and those reflections on the shortness of human life with which his writings abound To a lady who signified a great desire to increase her acquaintance with authors conceiving that more might be learned from their conversation and manner of living than from their works  'Madam' said he 'the best part of an author will always be found in his writings'  And to a person who once said he paid little regard to those writers on religion or morality whose practice corresponded not with their precepts he imputed a want of knowledge of mankind saying it was gross ignorance in him not to know that good principles and an irregular life were consistent with each other  This was a secret which without much mischief might have been revealed in conversation but Johnson  has thought fit to send it abroad in the fourteenth number of the Rambler with this apology  'We are not to wonder that most fail amidst tumult and snares and dangers in the observance of those precepts which they lay down in solitude safety and tranquillity with a mind unbiassed and with liberty unobstructed It is the condition of our present state to see more than we can attain the exactest vigilance and caution can never maintain a single day of innocence much less can the utmost efforts of incorporated mind reach the summits of speculative virtue'  He farther says  'It is recorded of Sir Mathew Hale that he for a long time concealed the consecration of himself to the stricter duties of religion lest by some flagitious and shameful action he should bring piety into disgrace  This kind of timidity surely stands in need of some excuse for what would become of the world were all religious men subjected by the same fear or how would that precept be obeyed which requires us to let our light so shine as that men may see our good works Men in conspicuous stations of life and in particular magistrates are under the strongest obligations to favour and support the cause of religion so it be done without ostentation And in private life our duty requires that the fear of being thought weak or superstitious should never deter us from making an open profession of our faith He that in his study affects to be found with a bible before him may be justly suspected of hypocrisy but he that upon the approach of a friend conveys it away is guilty of meanness and of the two the greater criminal  '  and upon this his conduct he suggests that  'it may be prudent for a writer who apprehends that he shall not enforce his own maxims by his domestic character to conceal his name that he may not injure them'  In this passage Johnson seems to prepare his readers for that contrariety which is often observed between the lives of authors and their writings or which is much the same between preceptive and practical wisdom and virtue as if they were scarcely consistent with each other whereas had his acquaintance lain at this time as in the latter part of his life it did with persons of rank and condition he might have formed different notions on the subject and been convinced that all ages and even the present have afforded examples of men in whom learning and parts and even wit were but auxiliaries to qualities more estimable  Bishop Taylor and lord Clarendon were both men of learning and parts teachers of wisdom and exemplary in their lives the same may be said of lordchancellor Hardwicke and bishop Hoadly the two latter over and above their other great endowments were classical scholars and what is more they wrote verses yet were they eminent for their skill in all the concerns of human life Of the sagacity of the last I am able to relate a fact which the bishop himself told me A man of the name of Fournier a clergyman and a proselyte from the Romish church had upon a franked cover with the bishop's name to it forged a promissory note for l The bishop brought a bill in chancery for a discovery of the consideration of the pretended note upon which the defendant with a view to entrap him sent it by his wife to the bishop with a permission for him if he pleased to burn it The paper was of a singular form and had on it the marks of several folds the appearance of a rasure of the word  free  and was upon the face of it in many other respects extremely suspicious but the bishop seeing the snare that was laid for him and with a view that these evidences of forgery should for ever remain with the note first made a memorandum of these several particulars and then with great temper returned it to the woman Had he destroyed the note as he was authorised and as almost any man else knowing it to be a forgery would have done the evidentia rei had been lost and the defendant had been in a better condition than he ever could be while the note existed At the hearing of the cause the note upon the face of it was condemned and the bishop secured against demand of payment    The above facts and observations are meant to shew some of the most conspicuous features and foibles in Johnson's character and go to prove not only that his ferocity was not so terrific as that any one endued with temper and disposed to moderation and forbearance might not only withstand but overcome it but that he had a natural imbecillity about him arising from humanity and pity to the sufferings of his fellowcreatures that was prejudicial to his interests and also that he neither sought nor expected praise for those acts of beneficence which he was daily performing nor looked for any retribution from those who were nourished by his bounty Indeed they were such creatures as were incapable of being awed by a sense of his worth or of discerning the motives that actuated him they were people of the lowest and vulgarest minds  Of such lord Bacon observes that  'the lowest virtues draw praise from them the middle work in them astonishment and admiration but of the higher virtues they have no sense or perceiving'  Essay on Praise  whom idleness had made poor and liberality impudent and what is to be expected from such is known to all that are in the slightest degree acquainted with the world and lastly they shew his method of accounting for that manifest and striking contrariety which as he says has been often observed between the life of an author and his writings  The history of learning furnishes us with many examples of men who have deviated from the study of polite literature to that of the hermetic science or in plainer English to that sublimer chemistry which leads to the transmutation of metals and those who may have heard that Johnson exercised himself in chemical processes may perhaps think that his view therein was suddenly to become the possessor of immense riches but I am able to obviate this suspicion and assure them that his motive thereto was only curiosity and his end mere amusement At the time he frequented the club in Ivy lane Dyer was going through a course of chemistry under Dr Pemberton of Gresham college and would sometimes give us such descriptions of processes as were very entertaining particularly to Johnson who would listen to them attentively We may suppose that in the course of his reading he had acquired some knowledge of the theory of the art and that he wished for an opportunity of reducing that knowledge into practice he thought that time now come and though he had no fitter an apartment for a laboratory than the garret over his chambers in the Inner Temple he furnished that with an alembic with retorts receivers and other vessels adapted to the cheapest and least operose processes What his aims were at first I know not having forgotten the account he once gave me of the earliest of his chemical operations but I have since learned that they dwindled down to mere distillation and that from substances of the simplest and coarsest sort namely peppermint and the dregs of strong beer from the latter whereof he  was able to extract a strong but very nauseous spirit which all might smell but few chose to taste  Johnson had now considerably extended the circle of his acquaintance and added to the number of his friends sundry persons of distinguished eminence among them were Sir Joshua Reynolds Mr Edmund Burke Mr Beauclerk and Mr Langton With these he passed much of his time and was desirous of being still closer connected How much he delighted in convivial meetings how he loved conversation and how sensibly he felt the attractions of a tavern has already been mentioned and it was but a natural consequence of these dispositions that he should wish for frequent opportunities of indulging them in a way that would free him from domestic restraints from the observance of hours and a conformity to the regimen of families A tavern was the place for these enjoyments and a weekly club was instituted for his gratification and the mutual entertainment and delight of its several members The first movers in this association were Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds the number of persons included in it was nine the place of meeting was the Turk's head in Gerrard street the day Monday in every week and the hour of assembling seven in the evening To this association I had the honour of being invited The members were  Johnson  Sir Joshua Reynolds  Mr Edmund Burke  Christ Nugent MD  Oliver Goldsmith MB  Mr Topham Beauclerk  Mr Bennet Langton  Mr Anthony Chamier and  Myself  As some of the persons abovementioned are happily  yet living and are too eminently known to receive honour from any thing I am able to say of them I shall content myself with giving the characters of such of them as are now no more  Dr Nugent was a physician of the Romish communion and rising into practice with persons of that persuasion He was an ingenious sensible and learned man of easy conversation and elegant manners Johnson had a high opinion of him and always spoke of him in terms of great respect  Goldsmith is well known by his writings to have been a man of genius and of very fine parts but of his character and general deportment it is the hardest task any one can undertake to give a description I will however attempt it trusting to be excused if in the spirit of a faithful historian I record as well his singularities as his merits  There are certain memoirs of him extant from which we learn that his inclination cooperating with his fortunes which were but scanty led him into a course of life little differing from vagrancy that deprived him of the benefits of regular study it however gratified his humour stored his mind with ideas and some knowledge which when he became settled he improved by various reading yet to all the graces of urbanity he was a stranger With the greatest pretensions to polished manners he was rude and when he most meant the contrary absurd He affected Johnson's style and manner of conversation and when he had uttered as he often would a laboured sentence so tumid as to be scarce intelligible would ask if that was not truly Johnsonian yet he loved not Johnson but rather envied him for  his parts and once intreated a friend to desist from praising him  'for in doing so' said he 'you harrow up my very soul'  He had some wit but no humour and never told a story but he spoiled it The following anecdotes will convey some idea of the style and manner of his conversation  He was used to say he could play on the Germanflute as well as most menat other times as well as any man living and in his poem of the Traveller has hinted at this attainment in the following lines  To kinder skies where gentler manners reign  I turn and France displays her bright domain  Gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease  Pleas'd with thyself whom all the world can please  How often have I led thy sportive choir  With tuneless pipe beside the murmuring Loire  Where shading elms along the margin grew  And freshen'd from the wave the zephyr flew  And haply though my harsh touch falt'ring still  But mock'd all tune and marr'd the dancers skill  Yet would the village praise my wond'rous power  And dance forgetful of the noontide hour  But in truth he understood not the character in which music is written and played on that instrument as many of the vulgar do merely by ear Roubiliac the sculptor a merry fellow once heard him play and minding to put a trick on him pretended to be charmed with his performance as also that himself was skilled in the art and intreated him to repeat the air that he might write it down Goldsmith readily consenting Roubiliac called for paper and scored  thereon a few fivelined staves which having done Goldsmith proceeded to play and Roubiliac to write but his writing was only such random notes on the lines and spaces as any one might set down who had ever inspected a page of music When they had both done Roubiliac shewed the paper to Goldsmith who looking it over with seeming great attention said it was very correct and that if he had not seen him do it he never could have believed his friend capable of writing music after him  He would frequently preface a story thus  'I'll now tell you a story of myself which some people laugh at and some do not'  At the breaking up of an evening at a tavern he intreated the company to sit down and told them if they would call for another bottle they should hear one of his bons motsthey agreed and he began thus  'I was once told that Sheridan the player in order to improve himself in stagegestures had lookingglasses to the number of ten hung about his room and that he practised before them upon which I said then there were ten ugly fellows together'  The company were all silent he asked why they did not laugh which they not doing he without tasting the wine left the room in anger  He once complained to a friend in these words  'Mr Martinelli is a rude man I said in his hearing that there were no good writers among the Italians and he said to one that sat near him that I was very ignorant  Mr Martinelli is an Italian  '  'People' said he 'are greatly mistaken in me a notion goes about that when I am silent I mean to  be impudent but I assure you gentlemen my silence arises from bashfulness'  Having one day a call to wait on the late duke then earl of Northumberland I found Goldsmith waiting for an audience in an outer room I asked him what had brought him there he told me an invitation from his lordship I made my business as short as I could and as a reason mentioned that Dr Goldsmith was waiting without The earl asked me if I was acquainted with him I told him I was adding what I thought likely to recommend him I retired and staid in the outer room to take him home Upon his coming out I asked him the result of his conversation  'His lordship' says he 'told me he had red my poem' meaning the Traveller 'and was much delighted with it that he was going lordlieutenant of Ireland and that hearing that I was a native of that country he should be glad to do me any kindness'  And what did you answer asked I to this gracious offer  'Why' said he 'I could say nothing but that I had a brother there a clergyman that stood in need of help as for myself I have no dependence on the promises of great men I look to the booksellers for support they are my best friends and I am not inclined to forsake them for others'  Thus did this idiot in the affairs of the world trifle with his fortunes and put back the hand that was held out to assist him Other offers of a like kind he either rejected or failed to improve contenting himself with the patronage of one nobleman whose mansion afforded him the delights of a splendid table and a retreat for a few days from the metropolis  While I was writing the History of Music he at the club communicated to me some curious matter I desired he would reduce it to writing he promised me he would and desired to see me at his chambers I called on him there he stepped into a closet and tore out of a printed book six leaves that contained what he had mentioned to me  As he wrote for the booksellers we at the club looked on him as a mere literary drudge equal to the task of compiling and translating but little capable of original and still less of poetical composition he had nevertheless unknown to us written and addressed to the countess afterwards duchess of Northumberland one of the finest poems of the lyric kind that our language has to boast of the ballad  'Turn gentle Hermit of the dale  Printed in his poetical works vol  '  and surprised us with  'The Traveller'  a poem that contains some particulars of his own history Johnson was supposed to have assisted him in it but he contributed to the perfection of it only four lines his opinion of it was that it was the best written poem since the time of Pope The favourable reception which this essay of his poetical talent met with soon after tempted Goldsmith to the publication of his  'Deserted Village'  the merits whereof consisting in local particularities and beautiful descriptions of rural manners are sufficiently known  His poems are replete with fine moral sentiments and bespeak a great dignity of mind yet he had no sense of the shame nor dread of the evils of poverty In the latter he was at one time so involved  that for the clamours of a woman to whom he was indebted for lodging and for bailiffs that waited to arrest him he was equally unable till he had made himself drunk to stay within doors or go abroad to hawk among the booksellers his  'Vicar of Wakefield'  In this distress he sent for Johnson who immediately went to one of them and brought back money for his relief  In his dealings with the booksellers he is said to have acted very dishonestly never fulfilling his engagements In one year he got of them and by his plays the sum of l which he dissipated by gaming and extravagance and died poor in  He that can account for the inconsistencies of character abovenoted otherwise than by shewing that wit and wisdom are seldom found to meet in the same mind will do more than any of Goldsmith's friends were ever able to do He was buried in the poets' corner in Westminster abbey A monument was erected for him by a subscription of his friends and is placed over the entrance into St Blase's chapel The inscription thereon was written by Johnson This I am able to say with certainty for he shewed it to me in manuscript  The members of our club that remain to be spoken of were persons of less celebrity than him abovementioned but were better acquainted with the world and qualified for social intercourse Mr Beauclerk was allied to the St Alban's family and took his christian name from Mr Topham of Windsor the famous collector of pictures and drawings To the character of a scholar and a man of fine parts he added that of a man of fashion of which his  dress and equipage shewed him to be emulous In the early period of his life he was the exemplar of all who wished without incurring the censure of foppery to become conspicuous in the gay world Travel and a long residence at Rome and at Venice had given the last polish to his manners and stored his mind with entertaining information In painting and sculpture his taste and judgment were accurate in classic literature exquisite and in the knowledge of history and the study of antiquities he had few equals His conversation was of the most excellent kind learned witty polite and where the subject required it serious and over all his behaviour there beamed such a sunshine of chearfulness and good humour as communicated itself to all around him He was a great collector of books and left at his death a library which at a sale by auction yielded upwards of five thousand pounds  Mr Anthony Chamier was descended from a French prorestant family that has produced one or more very eminent divines and were refugees in this country at the end of the last century He was bred to the profession of a stockbroker but having had a liberal education his deportment and manner of transacting business distinguished him greatly from most others of that calling He had acquired a knowledge of the modern languages particularly of the Spanish in the study whereof he took great delight His connections at his setting out in the world were of the best kind for very early in his life he was employed by those liberalminded brothers the Van Necks whose riches and general munificence have ranked them in the same class of  wealthy men with the Fuggers of Augsburg a company of moneydealers who in their time held the balance of the Antwerp exchange and by their transactions at that mart influenced the politics of all the courts of Europe  A curious account of these three brothers may be seen in Moreri's dictionary art Fugger ou Foucker Mention of them is also made in the journal of Edward VI inserted in an appendix to one of the volumes of bishop Burnet's History of the Reformation  By his dealings in the funds and it was supposed with the advantage of intelligence which previous to the conclusion of the peace before the last he had obtained he acquired such a fortune as enabled him though young to quit business and become what indeed he seemed by nature intended for a gentleman At the beginning of his present majesty's reign he had a prospect of going secretary to an embassy to Spain and was preparing for it by the improvement of himself in the language of that country but a change in the appointment of an ambassador kept him at home and gave him opportunity of becoming acquainted with lord Hilsborough who upon his being made secretary of state the last time took him for his undersecretary in which station he died  It was Johnson's original intention that the number of this our club should not exceed nine but Mr Dyer a member of that in Ivy lane before spoken of and who for some years had been abroad made his appearance among us and was cordially received By the recommendation of Mr Belchier the banker and member for Southwark he had obtained an appointment to be one of the commissaries in our army in Germany but on the conclusion of the peace he  returned to England very little the better for an employment which few have been known to quit without having made a fortune  The hours which Johnson spent in this society seemed to be the happiest of his life he would often applaud his own sagacity in the selection of it and was so constant at our meetings as never to absent himself It is true he came late but then he stayed late for as has been already said of him he little regarded hours Our evening toast was the motto of Padre Paolo  'Esto perpetua'  A lady distinguished by her beauty and taste for literature invited us twice to a dinner at her house which I alone was hindered from accepting Curiosity was her motive and possibly a desire of intermingling with our conversation the charms of her own She affected to consider us as a set of literary men and perhaps gave the first occasion for distinguishing the society by the name of the literary club an appellation which it never assumed to itself  At these our meetings Johnson as indeed he did every where led the conversation yet was he far from arrogating to himself that superiority which some years before he was disposed to contend for He had seen enough of the world to know that respect was not to be extorted and began now to be satisfied with that degree of eminence to which his writings had exalted him This change in his behaviour was remarked by those who were best acquainted with his character and it rendered him an easy and delightful companion Our discourse was miscellaneous but chiefly literary Politics the most vulgar of all topics were alone excluded On that subject most of us were of the same opinion The British lion  was then licking his wounds and we drank to the peace of old England  As I was the only seceder from this society my withdrawing myself from it seems to require an apology We seldom got together till nine the enquiry into the contents of the larder and preparing supper took up till ten and by the time that the table was cleared it was near cleven at which hour my servants were ordered to come for me and as I could not enjoy the pleasure of these meetings without disturbing the oeconomy of my family I chose to forego it    The institution of this society was in the winter of at which time Mr Garrick was abroad with his wife who for the recovery of her health was sent to the baths at Padua Upon his return he was informed of our association and trusted that the least intimation of a desire to come among us would procure him a ready admission but in this he was mistaken Johnson consulted me upon it and when I could find no objection to receiving him exclaimed'He will disturb us by his buffoonery'and afterwards so managed matters that he was never formally proposed nor by consequence ever admitted  This conduct of Johnson gave me for the first time to understand that the friendship between him and Garrick was not so strong as it might be supposed to be it was not like that of David and Jonathan it passed not the love of women and hardly exceeded the strength of an adventitious intimacy Garrick had a profound veneration for the learning and talents of Johnson but was used to complain to me that he was capricious in his friendship and as he termed it coquettish in his display of it Johnson on his part hated the profession of a player and perhaps  might contemplate with indignation that disposition of the public which assigns to those who minister to their pleasures greater rewards than to those whose employment it is to supply their most essential wants He might possibly reflect that in his outset in life as an instructor of youth his hopes were bounded by the prospect of five hundred pounds a year and that the mimetic powers of Garrick for under that denomination he ranked all his excellencies produced to the possessor of them an income of four thousand  These are such excuses for Johnson's coolness towards an old friend as charity might suggest but alas it had a deeper root and it is to be feared that it sprung from envy a passion which he sometimes was candid enough to confess he was subject to and laboured through his life to eradicate His behaviour to Garrick was ever austere like that of a schoolmaster to one of his scholars  He assumed a right of correcting his enunciation and by an instance convinced Garrick that it was sometimes erroneous  'You often' said Johnson 'mistake the emphatical word of a sentence''Give me an example' said Garrick'I cannot' answered Johnson 'recollect one but repeat the seventh commandment'Garrick pronounced it'Thou  shalt  not commit adultery''You are wrong' said Johnson 'it is a negative precept and ought to be pronounced thus  'Thou shalt  not  commit adultery'  and he flattered himself that in all he said and did he stood in awe of his frown  'I was' said Johnson once to a friend 'last night behind the scenes at Drurylane and met Davy dressed for his part I was glad to see him but I believe he was ashamed to see me'  A supposition hardly to be admitted even if he had been dressed in the rags of Drugger  Garrick took his rejection very patiently and shewed his resentment of it no otherwise than by enquiring of me from time to time how we went on at the club He would often stop at my gate in his way to and from Hampton with messages from Johnson relating to his Shakespeare then in the press and ask such questions as these  'Were you at the club on Monday night''What did you talk of''Was Johnson there''I suppose he said something of Davythat Davy was a clever fellow in his way full of convivial pleasantry but no poet no writer ha'  I was vexed at these enquiries and told him that this perpetual solicitude about what was said of him was unnecessary and could only tend to disturb him that he might well be content with that share of the public favour which he enjoyed that he had nothing to do but to possess it in quietness and that too great an anxiety to obtain applause would provoke envy and tend to intercept if not totally deprive him of it  The greatest of Mr Garrick's foibles was a notion of the importance of his profession he thought that Shakespeare and himself were or ought to be the objects of all mens' attention When the king of Denmark was in England he received an order from the lordchamberlain to entertain that monarch with an exhibition of himself in six of his principal characters In his way to London to receive his instructions he called on me and told me this as news I could plainly discern in his looks the joy that transported him but he affected to be vexed at the shortness of the notice and seemed to arraign the wisdom of our councils by exclaiming  'You see what heads they have'  Johnson's objection to the admission of Garrick may seem to be cynical and to have arisen from jealousy or resentment but it admits of palliation the truth is that Garrick was no disquisitor his reading had been confined and he could contribute but little to the pleasures of sober and instructive conversation Even his knowledge of the world was derived through the medium of the dramatic writers who all men know are not guides to be trusted and in his intercourse with mankind and manner of conducting business he frequently betrayed such ignorance and inattention as the following instance will illustrate  There stood near the dwelling of Mr Garrick at Hampton and adjoining to his garden next the river a small house the owner and occupier whereof was Mr Peele a bookseller who had retired from business Mr Peele had often said that as he knew it would be an accommodation to Mr Garrick he had given directions that at his decease he should have the refusal of it A man in the neighbourhood had set his eye upon it and formed a scheme to make it his own He had got intelligence that there was a relation or friend of Mr Peele's living in the country and immediately on Mr Peele's death applied to his executors pretending that he had a commission from him to purchase the house at any price and upon this suggestion procured a conveyance of it to a person nominated by him but under a secret trust for himself Mr Garrick seeing himself thus balked of his hopes and in danger of being troubled with an ill neighbour thought he had nothing to do but to complain He told his sad story to me and in a  lucky hour for just before his entering my house I had been reading the life of the lordkeeper Guildford and therein a case of a similar fraud against which his lordship decreed it was the case of the duke of Buckinghamshire and Ambrose Phillips who had purchased of the duke an estate as for Mr Heneage Finch a son of the lord Nottingham but in truth for himself at two thousand pounds less than he would have sold it for to any but Mr Finch Upon hearing Mr Garrick's story I searched farther and found the case in lawlanguage in Vernon's chancery reports and giving him a note of it told him he might file a bill in chancery and on the authority of that determination hope for relief About six months after I being in town a message came to me in the evening from Mr Garrick signifying that his cause was to come on the next morning and requesting me to furnish him with a note of a case that I had formerly mentioned to him as resembling his own Astonished at his remissness and knowing that no time was to be lost I immediately borrowed the book I had referred him to and giving it my servant went with it to Drurylane theatre where upon enquiry I was informed that he was busily employed in exhibiting an imitation of a spectacle then recent the procession of the coronation of his present majesty in an afterpiece to the play for that night I waited in an outer room till all was over when in entered Mr and Mrs Garrick and after giving him time to recover from his fatigue I told him what I had been doing to help him in his distress and produced the book but his thoughts were so wholly taken up by the pageant he  was come from which seemed still to be passing before his eyes that he could searcely attend to me but asked Mrs Garrick twenty questions about it how it went off and whether she did not think the applause of the audience great He then turned to me took from me the book and said he should lay it before his counsel The book was returned in a few days but I heard nothing of the decree of the court till some months after when meeting with his brother George in the court of requests I asked him how the cause had gone  'Oh' said he 'with usthe first purchase is decreed fraudulent and the defendant is condemned in costs'  Mr Garrick's forgetfulness and inattention in a concern that gave him some uneasiness is not to be accounted for by those who believe contrary to the fact that he was ever sufficiently awake to his own interest nor indeed by any who were not well acquainted with his character In all that related to the theatre he was very acute but in business of other kinds a novice His profession was of such a nature as left him no intervals of thought or cool deliberation his mind was either elevated to the highest pitch of inten  on or let down to the lowest degree of remission In the former state it was inflated by the ideas with which the course of his reading had stored his memory in the latter it sunk into an indolent levity which indulged in jokes in mimicry and witticisms  In the first of these situations I have described him by the relation of his conduct in a lawsuit in a season of vacuity he was another man easy and chearful  and disposed out of every thing he saw or heard to extract mirth The following story I give as an instance of his pleasantry at times when the business of the theatre did not occupy his thoughts  Living at Twickenham at about two miles distance from his house at Hampton I made him as I frequently did when in the country an afternoon visit It was in the month of August and I found him and Mrs Garrick in the garden eating figs He complained that the wasps which that year were very numerous had left him very few and talking farther about those noxious insects told me he had heard that a person near Uxbridge having swallowed one of them in a draught of liquor had died of the sting I told him it was true for that at a turnpikemeeting at Uxbridge I had dined with the apothecary that had attended him and he had assured me of the fact  'I believe it'said Mr Garrick 'and have been persuading this lady'pointing to Mrs Garrick 'to do so but I cannot convince her and yet she can believe the story of St Ursula and the eleven thousand virgins'  Mrs Garrick it is no secret is of the Romish persuasion  Davies in his life of Mr Garrick has mentioned a variety of particulars that do honour to his memory Among others he gives several instances of liberality to his friends Johnson would frequently say that he gave away more money than any man of his income in England and his readiness to give the profits of a night to public charities and to families and individuals in distress will long be remembered He was the first that attempted to reform the stage by banishing from it all profaneness and immorality and by expunging  from the plays acted at his theatre every expression capable of any other than a good meaning And whereas it had for many years been the custom at one or more of the theatres to indulge the mob in the evening of the lordmayor's day with the representation of  'The London Cuckolds'  a comedy written by Ravenscroft in times of great licentiousness and abounding in scenes of vulgar humour he paid a handsome compliment to the citizens and shewed his regard for the welfare of youth by discontinuing the practice and substituting in its place the affecting tragedy of  'George Barnwell'  a play adapted to the situation and circumstances of city apprentices and affording an instructive lesson of discretion and morality  Notwithstanding the perpetual competition between him and Rich for the favour of the town they lived together upon the most friendly terms Rich who was never celebrated either for his wit or his understanding once made him a very elegant compliment the occasion was this Rich had improved his house at Covent garden by altering the disposition of the seats so as to accommodate a greater number of spectators than formerly it would and Mr Garrick wishing to see these improvements Mr Rich invited him to the house and went with him all over it In the course of their survey Mr Garrick asked in the language of the theatre what sum of money the house would hold  'Sir' said Mr Rich 'that question question I am at present unable to answer but were Mr Garrick to appear but one night on my stage I should be able to tell to the utmost shilling'  After all that has been said of Mr Garrick envy must own that he owed his celebrity to his merit and yet of that himself seemed so diffident that he practised sundry little but innocent arts to insure the favour of the public He kept up an interest in the city by appearing about twice in a winter at Tom's coffeehouse in Cornhill the usual rendezvous of young merchants at 'change time and frequented a club established for the sake of his company at the Queen'sarms tavern in St Paul's churchyard where were used to assemble Mr Samuel Sharpe the surgeon Mr Paterson the citysolicitor Mr Draper the bookseller Mr Clutterbuck a mercer and a few others they were none of them drinkers and in order to make a reckoning called only for French wine These were his standing council in theatrical affairs and were of use to him in moderating his resentment after those riots at his theatre which would sometimes happen and the indignation he once felt upon an attack on his dwellinghouse in which the windows thereof were broken  He had also a strong party of friends at Batson's coffeehouse and among them Dr Wilson a physician a man of great learning  He was the editor of the works of Benjamin Robins published in two volumes vo  but no practice who having an easy fortune and no family and being master of his own time was at liberty to indulge himself in a variety of pursuits and humours that distinguished him from most other men He lodged in an obscure part of the town and spent his mornings in mathematical studies but at noon was constantly to  be seen at Batson's with a circle of persons round him whom he entertained with his conversation He had no taste for polite literature or stage entertainments but in his old age took it into his head to be an admirer of Mr Garrick and seldom failed to be at his theatre whenever he had a part in the play of the night His constant appearance there had procured him almost a prescriptive right to a particular seat in the pit In that region of the house he was the first and almost the loudest applauder of Mr Garrick and his praises were the chief subject of his discourse the succeeding day To this person as to a cityfriend Mr Garrick held himself obliged and by many personal civilities he courted his favour  Such as those above noted were the foibles in the character of that celebrated actor of whom I have been speaking and such were the arts which he practised to acquire and ensure popularity arts as unnecessary as they were innocent seeing that almost from the time he first became known he was in the actual possession of that applause which he was seeking and received from the public an ample reward of reputation as well for the part he acted in social life as for his excellent performance on the stage  Besides Mr Garrick there were others that were desirous of becoming members of this our club the fame whereof had spread abroad and induced many who hoped to acquire a reputation for literature to wish for an admission among us That unfortunate divine as he was called Dr William Dodd was one of the number and made a secret effort for this purpose This person at that time dwelt with his wife in an obscure corner of Hounslow heath  near a village called Worton but kept in a back lane near him a girl who went by the name of Kennedy His pretensions to learning and especially to classical erudition were very great and he had in his house a few young gentlemen who at very expensive rates were committed to his care as to an academy for instruction A brother of his wife's rented some land of me and of him I learned from time to time many particulars respecting his character and manner of living which latter as he represented it was ever such as his visible income would no way account for He said that he was the most importunate suitor for preferment ever known and that himself had been the bearer of letters and messages to great men soliciting promotion to vacant livings and had hardly escaped kicking down stairs Dodd's wish to be received into our society was conveyed to us only by a whisper and that being the case all opposition to his admission became unnecessary  Johnson was now at ease in his circumstances he wanted his usual motive to impel him to the exertion of his talents necessity and he sunk into indolence Whoever called in on him at about midday found him and Levett at breakfast Johnson in deshabille as just risen from bed and Levett filling out tea for himself and his patron alternately no conversation passing between them All that visited him at these hours were welcome A night's rest and breakfast seldom failed to refresh and fit him for discourse and whoever withdrew went too soon His invitations to dinners abroad were numerous and he seldom balked them At evening parties where were  no cards he very often made one and from these when once engaged most unwillingly retired  In the relaxation of mind which almost any one might have foreseen would follow the grant of his pension he made little account of that lapse of time on which in many of his papers he so severely moralizes And though he was so exact an observer of the passing minutes as frequently after his coming from church to note in his diary how many the service took up in reading and the sermon in preaching he seemed to forget how many years had passed since he had begun to take in subscriptions for his edition of Shakespeare Such a torpor had seized his faculties as not all the remonstrances of his friends were able to cure applied to some minds they would have burned like caustics but Johnson felt them not to other objects he was sufficiently attentive as I shall presently shew  In the performance of the engagement I am under I find myself compelled to make public as well those particulars of Johnson that may be thought to abase as those that exalt his character Among the former may be reckoned the credit he for some time gave to the idle story of the Cocklane ghost concerning which the following facts are the least unworthy of being noted In the month of January it was reported that at a house in Cock lane near West Smithfield there were heard certain noises accompanied with extraordinary circumstances tending to the discovery of the death of a young woman who was said to have been destroyed by poison The agent in this business was a girl who pretended that  the spirit of the deceased appeared to her and terrified her with the noises abovementioned This report drew many persons to the house who being thus assembled put several questions to the girl and received answers as from the ghost describing the circumstances of the poisoning and a promise by an affirmative signal that it would attend one of the querists into the vault under the church of St John Clerkenwell where the body was deposited and give a token of its presence by a knock upon the coffin it was therefore determined to make trial of the existence or veracity of the supposed spirit and it was then advertised that the person to whom the promise was made was about to visit the vault and accordingly the whole company present adjourned to the church He who had a claim to the performance of the promise and one more went into the vault and solemnly required to hear the signal but nothing more ensued The person accused of the poisoning with several others then descended the vault but no effect was perceived It was therefore the opinion of the whole assembly that the girl had some art of making or counterfeiting particular noises and that there was no agency of any higher cause  Johnson whose sentiments with respect to supernatural agency are discoverable in many parts of his writings was prompted by curiosity to visit this place and wait for the appearance of the ghost Mr Saunders Welch his intimate friend would have dissuaded him from his purpose urging that it would expose him to ridicule but all his arguments had no effect he went to the house and as it is supposed into the  church and gave countenance to the vulgar expectation that the ghost would appear but at length being convinced that the whole transaction was an imposture he drew up as may be inferred from the style and advertisement at the end of the paper an account of the detection thereof published in the Gentleman's Magazine for February  Soon after this the imposture being more clearly and even to demonstration detected the persons concerned in it were prosecuted and underwent a punishment suited to their offence  What Mr Welch foretold in his advice to Johnson touching this imposture was now verified he was censured for his credulity his wisdom was arraigned and his religious opinions resolved into superstition A reverend divine of the time who had taken effectual care by his conduct to avoid the like imputations but was enough distinguished by a greater folly political enthusiasm exhibited him to ridicule in a satyrical poem and revived the remembrance of that engagement to the public which by this and other instances of the laxity of his mind he seemed not much inclined to fulfil  Nor was this all that facetious gentleman Mr Foote who upon the strength and success of his satyrical vein in comedy had assumed the name of the modern Aristophanes and at his theatre had long entertained the town with caricatures of living persons with all their singularities and weaknesses thought that Johnson at this time was become a fit subject for ridicule and that an exhibition of him in a drama written for the purpose in which himself should represent Johnson and in his mien his garb and his  speech should display all his comic powers would yield him a golden harvest Johnson was apprised of his intention and gave Mr Foote to understand that the licence under which he was permitted to entertain the town would not justify the liberties he was accustomed to take with private characters and that if he persisted in his design himself would be a spectator of his disgrace and would by a severe chastisement of his representative on the stage and in the face of the whole audience convince the world that whatever were his infirmities or even his foibles they should not be made the sport of the public or the means of gain to any one of his profession  Had Johnson been provoked to an exercise of his prowess on this occasion it would not have been the first display of his resentment on the stage of a theatre He was once with Garrick at the representation of a play in his native city of Lichfield when having taken his seat in a chair placed on the stage he had soon a call to quit it A Scots officer who had no goodwill towards him persuaded an innkeeper of the town to take it and he did as he was bid Johnson on his return finding his seat sull civilly told the intruder that by going out it was not his intention to give it up and demanded it as his right the innkeeper encouraged by the officer seeming resolved to maintain his situation Johnson expostulated the matter with him but finding him obstinate lifted up the chair the man sitting in it and with such an Herculean force flung both to the opposite side of the stage that the Scotsman cried out  'Damn him he has broke his limbs'  but that not being the case Johnson having thus emptied the chair and Mr Walmsley interposing he resumed his seat in it and with great composure sat out the play  Johnson had great confidence in his corporeal strength and from this and some other particulars in his life I am inclined to think he was vain of it Such foibles are not uncommon in the greatest characters Sir Isaac Newton at the age of fourscore would strip up his shirtsleeve to shew his muscular brawny arm and relate how dextrous he was in his youth at boxing And an intimate friend of mine a serjeant at law of the first eminence in his profession who had nearly lost the use of his feet was used to relate to me his dancing whole nights when a young man without feeling the least weariness    Foote upon this intimation had discretion enough to desist from his purpose Johnson entertained no resentment against him and they were ever after friends  Johnson was insensible to the effects of this abuse but the poem abovementioned had brought to remembrance that his edition of Shakespeare had long been due His friends took the alarm and by all the arts of reasoning and persuasion laboured to convince him that having taken subscriptions for a work in which he had made no progress his credit was at stake He confessed he was culpable and promised from time to time to begin a course of such reading as was necessary to qualify him for the work this was no more than he had formerly done in an engagement with Coxeter to whom he had bound himself to write the life of Shakespeare but he never could be prevailed on to begin it so that even now it was questioned whether his promises were to be relied on For this reason Sir Joshua Reynolds and some other of his friends who were more concerned for his reputation than himself seemed to be contrived to entangle him by a wager or some other pecuniary engagement to perform his task by a certain time and this together possibly with some distrust of the continuance of his mental powers set him to work but as he had been remiss in making collections for the purpose he  found it an irksome task Theobald declares that to settle the text of his author and to elucidate obscure passages in him he had found it necessary to peruse a great number of plays and other publications to the very titles of most whereof it is certain Johnson was a stranger He it is true had red as many old English books as came in his way but he had never sought after any such he was no collector and in fact was destitute of materials for his work All therefore that he did or could do after the waste of so much time was to read over his author in the former editions and solicit help from his friends who if he is not mistaken in his assertion were but slack in offering him assistance To me among others he did the honour of sending for such notes as he thought I might have made in the course of my reading Mr Garrick was his messenger as he frequently passed by my gate in the country and though I was at that time deeply engaged in the History of Music I furnished him with a few remarks which unimportant as they are he thought fit to insert Others more valuable he got from such of his friends as were at leisure to assist him  The year gave to the world an edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works by Samuel Johnson the greatest proficient in vernacular erudition and one of the ablest critics of his time Much had been expected from it and little now appeared to have been performed a few conjectural emendations of the text and some scattered remarks on particular passages were all that was presented to our view that had any pretence to novelty except  some general observations which serve to illustrate the beauties and mark the defects of the several plays and are inserted at the end of each  For the apparent meagreness of the work the paucity of the notes and other evidences of the editor's want of industry and indeed unfitness for the office of a scholiast so far as it regards the illustration of the text some atonement it must be confessed is made by the preface wherein as if the author had reserved himself for one great effort of his genius all the powers of eloquence and critical erudition are displayed In truth it is an essay on dramatic poesy in general in which with a degree of perspicacity that had never before been exercised on the subject he has exhibited the perfections of his author in a blaze of splendour that distracts us with its radiance To attemper our admiration he has however thought fit to note the slumbers of even this great genius his violations of historical truth his deviations from dramatic regularity his low conceits and the frequent recurrence of scenes that suspend actions of importance and wherever interposed are excrescences and this not in a style of perfunctory disquisition but with such a degree of asperity as critics discover when they are criticising the works of a rival  For thus detracting from the merit of his favourite Mr Garrick was to the highest degree exasperated with Johnson he reproached him though not to his face with want of feeling and the knowledge of human nature of which he said he understood nothing but what he had learned from books  'All that he writes' added he 'comes from his head Shakespeare when he sat down to write dipped his pen into his own heart  The recollection of this forcible and just expression which Mr Garrick uttered to me induces me to relate a transaction that may serve to prove how deeply Shakespeare was skilled in the science of human nature and that his imagination could suggest sentiments and language suitable to characters and situations with which he could not be supposed ever to have been conversant No one thinks that he had ever been a witness to such a scene as that in Macbeth where the lady who had excited her husband to the murder of the king is herself restrained from the perpetration of it by the sole reflection that in his sleep he resembled her sather yet see how wonderfully his representation of it accords with the workings of nature  A few years since and while I was chairman of the quarterfessions for the county of Middlesex an indictment came before me for trial at Hicks'shall the ground whereof was the following case A vessel moored by a hawser or cablerope was lying in the Thames near Wapping at a time when a barge was driving up the river with so strong a tide that the men on board her were in great danger of running as they call it athwart the hawser and of oversetting To prevent this mischief a young active man who guided the barge leaped into the vessel a liberty in such cases always allowed and loosening the end of the hawser from what it was tied to let it drop The men on board the vessel ignorant perhaps of the usage opposed the young man in his attempt and a fray ensued in which provoked to resistance he seized a handspike and with it knocked one of the sailors down The noise of this scuffle drew up the master a person advanced in years who all the while was under deck and he being told what had passed asked the stranger what he meant by knocking his man down  'I did it' answered he 'in my own defence and if you had been in his place and your old grey locks had not put me in mind of my own father I would have knocked you down too'  The very sentiment that restrained lady Macbeth from the murder of Duncan  Had he not resembled  My father as he slept I had don't  '  Johnson seemed to be conscious that this work would fall short of the expectations it had raised and endeavoured to ward off the censure of the public by an insinuation in the preface that his friends had been backward in furnishing him with assistance The passage is pretty strongly pointed and is here given in his own words  'Having classed the observations of others I was at last to try what I could substitute for their mistakes and how I could supply their omissions I collated such copies as I could procure and wished for more but have not found the collectors of these rarities very communicative Of the editions which chance or kindness put into my hands I have given an enumeration that I may not be blamed for neglecting what I had not the power to do'  Few there were who saw this passage and knew that Mr Garrick had the earliest editions of all Shakespeare's plays but construed this into a reproach on him in that sense he understood it and it gave him great offence To clear himself of the imputation of a conduct so unfriendly he protested to me that his collection had ever been accessible to Johnson and that himself had signified that any or all the books in it were at his service and farther to convince me he at the next visit I made him called in his man Charles and bade him relate to me his instructions respecting the use of his library or the loan of books to Johnson  'Sir' said the man 'I was told to let Mr Johnson have whatever books he wanted but he never applied for any  Mr Garrick knew not what risque he ran by this offer Johnson had so strange a forgetfulness of obligations of this sort that few who lent him books ever saw them again Among the books in his library at the time of his decease I found a very old and curious edition of the works of Politian which appeared to belong to Pembroke college Oxford It was probably taken out of the library when he was preparing to publish a part of that author viz in and had been used as his own for upwards of fifty years  '  To say the truth Mr Garrick was rather forward in offering the use of his library to the writers of the time he did it to Mr Whalley when editing the works of Ben Jonson and to Dr Percy the collector and publisher of the  'Reliques of ancient English poetry'  His view as I conjecture was to receive in return for his kindness thanks with perhaps some additional compliment and in these two instances he was gratified with both I imagine that Johnson was unwilling to buy the favour intended him at that price and that therefore he declined it  We are not to suppose that the publication of Shakespeare a work undertaken without any impulse and executed with reluctance would greatly add to the literary reputation of Johnson yet such was the character he had acquired by his dictionary and other of his writings that the heads of the university of Dublin thought him worthy of the highest academical honour that it was in their power to confer and accordingly on the twentythird day of July he was by them presented with a diploma creating him doctor in both laws a distinction the more to be valued as it was unsolicited and a voluntary testimony of the esteem in which he was held by that learned body The causes assigned for bestowing  it are contained in the following words part of the instrument  'ob egregiam scriptorum elegantiam et utilitatem'  His great affection for our own universities and particularly his attachment to Oxford prevented Johnson from receiving this honour as it was intended and he never assumed the title which it conferred He was as little pleased to be called Doctor in consequence of it as he was with the title of Domine which a friend of his once incautiously addressed him by He thought it alluded to his having been a schoolmaster and though he has ably vindicated Milton from the reproach that Salmasius meant to fix on him by saying that he was of that profession  See his life of Milton among the lives of the poets  he wished to have it forgot that himself had ever been driven to it as the means of subsistence and had failed in the attempt  Johnson was now arrived at the fiftysixth year of his age and had actually attained to that state of independence which before he could only affect He was now in possession of an income that freed him from the apprehensions of want and exempted him from the necessity of mental labour He had discharged his obligations to the public and with no incumbrance of a family or any thing to controul his wishes or desires he had his mode of living to chuse Blest with what was to him a competence he had it now in his power to study to meditate and to put in practice a variety of good resolutions which almost from his first entrance into life he had been making  Some specimens of these have been given in a collection of prayers and devotional exercises lately published by his direction to which I could add a great number They are the effusions of a fervent piety and the result of most severe examinations of himself in his hours of retirement and have for their objects early rising a good use of time abstinence the study of the Scriptures and a constant attendance on divine worship in the performance of all which duties he seems to construe his frequent interruptions into criminal remissness One extract from his diary I however here insert for the purpose of shewing the state of his mind at about the beginning of the year  'Since the last reception of the Sacrament I hope I have no otherwise grown worse than as continuance in sin makes the sinner's condition more dangerous Since last Newyear's day I have risen every morning by eight at least not after nine which is more superiority over my habits than I have ever before been able to obtain Scruples still distress me My resolution with the blessing of God is to contend with them and if I can to conquer them  'My resolutions are  To conquer scruples  To read the bible this year  To try to rise more early  To study divinity  To live methodically  To oppose idleness  To frequent divine worship  It was a frequent practice with him in his addresses to the divine Majesty to commemorate and recommend to mercy his wife and departed friends and the knowledge thereof has induced a suspicion that he adopted the Romish tenet of Purgatory To clear his memory from this imputation I am necessitated to mention a few particulars which I learned from him in conversation that may serve to shew that no such conclusion is to be drawn from his practice in this respect for that his acquiescence therein arose from a controversy which about the year was agitated between certain divines of a Protestant communion that professed to deny not less than they did the doctrine of transubstantiation that of purgatory  These were the nonjuring clergy of the time of whom and also of their writings Johnson was ever used to speak with great respect One of them Dr Thomas Brett was a man profoundly skilled in ritual literature as appears by a dissertation of his printed together with a collection of ancient liturgies in  Johnson once told me he had heard his father say that when he was young in trade king Edward the sixth's first liturgy was much enquired for and setched a great price but that the publication of this book which contained the whole communion office as it stands in the former reduced the price of it to that of a common book  and he as I infer from the style of the book and the method of reasoning therein wrote a tract intitled  'Reasons for restoring some prayers and directions as they stand in the communionservice of the first English reformed liturgy compiled by the bishops in the second and third years of king Edward VI'  among which he argues for the following petition  part of the prayer for the whole state of Christ's church since called a prayer for the whole state of Christ's church militant here on earth  'We commend unto thy mercye O Lord all other thy seruauntes which are departed hence from us with the signe of saythe and now do reste in the slepe of peace Graunte unto them we beseche thee thy mercy and euerlastyng peace and that at the daie of the generall resurreccion we and all they which bee of the misticall body of thy sonne may altogether bee set on his right hand and heare that his most ioyfull voice Come unto me O ye that be blessed of my father and possesse the kingdome whiche is prepared for you from the begynning of the worlde Graunt this O Father for Jesus Christes sake our onely mediatour and aduocate'  He first shews that the recommending the dead to the mercy of God is nothing of the remains of popery but a constant usage of the primitive church and for this assertion he produces the authority of Tertullian who flourished within an hundred years after the death of the apostle St John and also the authority of St Cyprian St Cyril St Ambrose St Epiphanius St Chrysostom and St Augustine by citations from the several writings of those fathers  He then argues that this custom neither supposes the modern purgatory nor gives encouragement to libertinism and vice that the ancient church believed the recommending the dead a serviceable office that the custom seems to have gone upon this principle that supreme happiness is not to be expected till the resurrection and that the interval  between death and the end of the world is a state of imperfect bliss the church therefore concludes he might believe her prayers for good people would improve their condition and raise the satisfactions of this period  No one will say that these are mean authorities or object to the practice of thus recommending the dead as an innovation excepting those persons who reject all tradition in matters of religion Bucer was one that did and therefore being consulted in the revisal of king Edward's first liturgy he argued that there being no express warrant in Scripture for the practice prayer for the dead was sinful and accordingly the words contended for were omitted in the second  This tract was with great acuteness and no less learning answered by another nonjuring divine in one intitled  'No sufficient reasons for restoring some prayers and directions of king Edward the sixth's liturgy'  A reply was given to it and the controversy was carried on to a great length the result of it was a schism among the nonjurors those for restoring the prayers compiled a new communionoffice others who were against widening the breach with the national church chose to abide by the present form and this diversity of sentiments and practice was as Johnson once told me the ruin of the nonjuring cause  In the study of this controversy which I have reason to think interested Johnson very deeply he seems to have taken part with Dr Brett and the separatists his followers whose conduct is accounted for and vindicated in the dissertation on liturgies abovementioned  Such as are disposed to charge Johnson with weakness and superstition and are so weak as to insinuate that because he recommended his deceased wife and friends to the divine mercy though with the qualisying words  'so far as it may be lawful'  he must have been popishly affected or a believer in the doctrine of purgatory may hence learn to be less severe in their censures and lament their ignorance of ecclesiastical history which would have taught them that the practice prevailed long before popery was established or purgatory thought of and that though it may not upon the whole be defensible there is more to be said for it than many of the enemies to his memory are able to answer  Johnson in his early years associated with this sect of nonjurors and from them probably imbibed many of his religious and political principles    And to those of his friends who think that for the sake of his reputation the prayers and meditations in which these sentiments have appeared should have been suppressed it ought surely to be an answer that they were put into the hands of the reverend divine who to my knowledge attended him with great affection and assiduity through his last illness with an express charge to commit them to the press and who if he had forborne this friendly office had deprived a charitable and laudable institution of a benefit which the performance of it was intended to confer  With a view to improve the leisure he now enjoyed and seemingly determined to reform those habits of indolence which in the former part of his life he had  contracted he removed from the Temple into a house in Johnson's court Fleet street and invited thither his friend Mrs Williams An upper room which had the advantages of a good light and free air he fitted up for a study and furnished with books chosen with so little regard to editions or their external appearance as shewed they were intended for use and that he disdained the ostentation of learning Here he was in a situation and circumstances that enabled him to enjoy the visits of his friends and to receive them in a manner suitable to the rank and condition of many of them A silver standish and some useful plate which he had been prevailed on to accept as pledges of kindness from some who most esteemed him together with furniture that would not have disgraced a better dwelling banished those appearances of squalid indigence which in his less happy days disgusted those who came to see him  In one of his diaries he noted down a resolution to take a seat in the church this he might possibly do about the time of this his removal The church he frequented was that of St Clement Danes which though not his parishchurch he preferred to that of the Temple which I recommended to him as being free from noise and in other respects more commodious His only reason was that in the former he was best known He was not constant in his attendance on divine worship but from an opinion peculiar to himself and which he once intimated to me seemed to wait for some secret impulse as a motive to it  I could never collect from his discourse that he was drawn to public worship by the charms of pulpit eloquence or any affection for popular preachers who in general are the worst nor can I form any judgment of the value he set on it having never been present with him at church but once and that at a time when in compliment to him as it may be supposed the preacher gave us a sermon that red like a Saturday's Rambler  The Ramblers published on Saturdays were generally on religious or moral subjects  and was by many soon discovered to have been cast in the same mould or in other words of Johnson's composing but he seemed to think it a duty to accept in good part the endeavours of all public instructors however meanly qualified for the office and ever to forbear exercising his critical talents on the effusions of men inferior in learning and abilities to himself Probably he on such occasions recollected the quaint distich of Herbert  The worst have something good where all want sense  God takes the text and preacheth patience  Or he might have red among the essays of the Messieurs of PortRoyal one that teaches us how to profit by bad preaching  The Sundays which he passed at home were nevertheless spent in private exercises of devotion  He was accustomed on these days to read the Scriptures and particularly the Greek Testament with the paraphrase of Erasmus Very late in his life he formed a resolution to read the bible through which he confessed to me he had never done at the same time lamenting that he had so long neglected to peruse what he called the charter of his salvation    and sanctified by acts of charity of a singular kind on that day he accepted of no invitation abroad but gave a dinner to such of his poor friends as might else have gone without one  He had little now to conflict with but what he called his morbid melancholy which though oppressive had its intermissions and left him the free exercise of all his faculties and the power of enjoying the conversation of his numerous friends and visitants These reliefs he owed in a great measure to the use of opium which as I have elsewhere mentioned he was accustomed to take in large quantities the effect whereof was generally such an exhilaration of his spirits as he sometimes suspected for intoxication  I am now about to mention a remarkable era of his life distinguished by a connexion that for many years was a source of great satisfaction and comfort to him It was a friendship contracted as his diary imports in with Mr Thrale a brewer in Southwark who though a follower of a trade which in other countries is lightly thought of yet as in this it implies great opulence and the power of conducing in various ways to the interests of the community ranked as a gentleman He had received the benefit of an university education and was a representative in parliament as his father had been for the abovementioned borough and in every view of his character could not but be deemed a valuable addition  to the number of Johnson's friends To his villa at Streatham in Surrey Johnson was invited not as a guest but as a resiant whenever he was disposed to change the town for the country air for his accommodation an apartment was allotted for his entertainment a library was furnished with such books as himself chose and little was wanting to persuade him that when at Streatham he was at home He soon experienced the salutary effects of his new abode and there is little doubt that to it he was indebted for some years of his life  It might have been expected that Johnson in the easy circumstances in which he had for some time felt himself and with such a love of independence as he affected would have declined obligations that he was unable to repay at least in kind but he knew that friendship weighs not in a balance the favours it confers Mr Thrale's tenders carried in them all the evidences of sincerity and he had the example of men equally wise with himself to justify his acceptance of such invitations as were now made him  The instances of this kind that occur in the lives of eminent men to speak of those of this country only are not few Hobbes of Malmesbury passed many years of his life in philosophical retirement at Chatsworth in the family of the earl of Devonshire memorials whereof were formerly visible in Latin verses written by him with a diamond on the windows of the house Selden at the countess of Kent's in Whitefriars adjoining to the Temple Mr Locke was considered as one of the family of lady Masham at Oates in the county of Essex She was a daughter of Dr Ralph Cudworth a woman of such eminence for learning and piety that the book intitled  'The whole duty of man'  was for some time believed to be of her writing and lastly Dr Isaac Watts found a comfortable retreat from the cares of the world in the family of Sir Thomas Abney and his worthy descendants at Newington in Middlesex Johnson's situation in Mr Thrale's family was not so constant and uninterrupted as was that of the persons abovementioned in their several abodes but in respect of the liberties allowed him and the kindness with which he was treated the comparison is no way to the disadvantage of this his friend  The only obligation they subjected him to  was that of supporting his character and in a family where there were many visitants furnishing such conversation as was to be expected from a man who had distinguished himself by his learning his wit and his eloquence This it must be confessed was a burdensome task to one who like others must be supposed to have had his sombrous intervals and in the hour of repletion to wish for the indulgence of being silent or at least of talking like other men To be continually uttering apophthegms or speeches worthy of remembrance was more than could have been expected of Socrates  What were Johnson's sentiments of a situation like this may be gathered from the following note which I meet with in his adversaria or collections for the Rambler now in my possession and spoken of in a preceding page  'Philomeidis invited to the house of Largus in the country as a wit Largus means to credit himself by his acquaintancecalls in the country to be entertainedthey come big with expectation full of awe Silent therefore I silentDisappointedLargus chagrinedBehaviour of boors before a wittheir eagerness expectation surprise at any thing common I near dullCle  ra a lady dreaded for her elegance and knowledge came by chance I shame I now am proud nobody worth speaking to Inform them Mr Rambler that no man can be a wit at pleasure or converse wittily by himselfI was at first invited to tablesmy friend now goes without meI restrain not direct  'Nothing so unfortunate as a wit by profession one who raises expectation at his entryalways in debtmany pay with common placesothers unwilling to part with what chance has brought them spend their lives in straining or get at one place to retail in another Wit depends upon a thousand casualtiesan occasion combination of ideas presence of mind time accidental fit That excel in wit will own it is very little in a man's power That no man can appoint an hour in which he will be witty The luckiest thoughts such as a man not led to by a regular train The mind of a witty man the soil in which wit planted grows but few cultivate A man many thoughts in walk bed which when he has his pen and paper he cannot recover Folly of suffering reputation to depend on a repartee which often favours the dull The first principle of wit out of our power Scaliger's genius The EnglishMisery of writing without the vein then flowing The happy have their days and the unhappy and the genius the happy who has flows often and knows their value The little power men have over their effusions Genius made ancients attribute to impulse'  The hints here inserted were indubitably the rudiments of a paper No in the Rambler the concluding paragraph of which is in the following words  'I believe Mr Rambler that it has some time happened to others who have the good or ill fortune to be celebrated for wits to fall under the same censures upon the like occasions I hope therefore that you will prevent any misrepresentations of such failures by remarking that invention is not wholly at the command of its possessor that the power of pleasing is very often obstructed by the desire that all expectation lessens surprise yet some surprise is necessary to gaiety and that those who desire to partake of the pleasure of wit must contribute to its production since the mind stagnates without external ventilation and that effervescence of the fancy which slashes into transport can be raised only by the infusion of dissimilar ideas'    Besides the conveniences for study with which he was furnished at Streatham he had opportunities of exercise and the pleasure of airings and excursions He was once prevailed on by Mr Thrale to join in  the pleasures of the chace in which he shewed himself a bold rider for he either leaped or broke through many of the hedges that obstructed him This he did not because he was eager in the pursuit but as he said to save the trouble of alighting and remounting He did not derive the pleasure or benefit from riding that many do it had no tendency to raise his spirits and he once told me that in a journey on horseback he fell asleep In the exercise of a coach he had great delight it afforded him the indulgence of indolent postures and as I discovered when I have had him in my own the noise of it assisted his hearing  In Dr Pope's Wish I meet with the following note  'I have known several who could hear but little in their chambers but when they were in a coach rattling upon the stones heard very well I also knew a lady in Essex whose name was Tyrrel who while she had occasion to discourse used to beat a great drum without which she could not hear at all the reason whereof is this the most frequent cause of deafness is the relaxation of the tympanum or drum of the ear which by this violent and continual agitation of the air is extended and made more tight and springy and better reflects sounds like a drum new braced'    It cannot be supposed but that these indulgences were a great relief to Johnson in his declining years they nevertheless indisposed him for meditation and reflection and as he has noted in his diary assigning for the reason the irregularity of the family it broke his habit of early rising which he had persisted in from newyear's day to about the midsummer following  'March I have never I thank God since new year's day deviated from the practise of rising  'In this practice I persisted till I went to Mr Thrale's some time before midsummer the irregularity of that family broke my habit of rising I was there till after Michaelmas'  It is possible that the family had they  been disposed to it might with equal truth have complained that he was little less irregular and that if they obliged him to break his resolution of early rising he often prevented their retiring to rest at a seasonable hour that he might not want the gratification of tea  About this time Johnson had the honour of a conversation with his majesty in the library at the queen's house Whether the occasion of it was accidental or otherwise I have never been informed but from this account of it given by him it afforded him great satisfaction He spoke to me of the king's behaviour in terms of the highest gratitude and approbation and described it as equalling in grace and condescension what might have been expected from Lewis the fourteenth when the manners of the French court were in the highest state of cultivation The public are already in possession of the handsome compliment which his majesty made him I will nevertheless give it here a place he asked Johnson if he intended to give the world any more of his compositions Johnson answered he believed he should not for that he thought he had written enough  'I should have thought so too' replied his majesty 'if you had not written so well  Many sayings of princes have been thought worthy of recording I recollect one of George the second which for the elegance of it deserves to be remembered In the rebellion in Mr Thornton a Yorkshire gentleman raised at his own expence a body of horse and though but newly married to a beautiful young woman headed it and joined the king's army After the defeat at Culloden he with his wife went to court where being seen by the king who had noticed Mrs Thornton he was thus accosted by the monarch  'Mr Thornton I have been told of the services you have rendered to your country and your attachment to me and my family and have held myself obliged to you for both but I was never able to estimate the degree of the obligation till now that I see the lady whom you left behind you'  '  Johnson was now approaching towards sixty He was an exact computer of time and as his essays abundantly shew regretted deeply the lapse of those minutes that could not be recalled and though in his own judgment of himself he had been criminal in the waste of it he was ever resolving to subtract from his sleep those hours which are fittest for study and meditation Numberless are the resolutions that I meet with in his diaries for a series of years back to rise at eight but he was unable for any long continuance to perform them a weakness less inexcusable than he thought it for he was ever a bad sleeper and was sufficiently sensible of his infirmity in that respect to have allayed his scrupulosity had he not been a most rigorous judge of his actions To impress the more strongly on his mind the value of time and the use it behoved every wise man to make of it he indulged himself in an article of luxury which as far as my observation and remembrance will serve me he never enjoyed till this late period of his lise it was a watch which he caused to be made for him in the year by those eminent artists Mudge and Dutton it was of metal and the outer case covered with tortoiseshell he paid for it seventeen guineas On the dialplate thereof which  was of enamel he caused to be inscribed in the original Greek these words of our blessed Saviour  John chap ix v  but with the mistake of a letter μ for ν the meaning of them is  'For the night cometh'  This though a memento of great importance he about three years after thought pedantic he therefore exchanged the dialplate for one in which the inscription was omitted  In the same year upon the establishment of the royal academy of painting sculpture c Johnson was nominated professor of ancient literature an office merely honorary and conferred on him as it is supposed upon the recommendation of the president Sir Joshua Reynolds  In the variety of subjects on which he had exercised his pen Johnson had hitherto forborne to meddle with the disputes of contending factions which is all that at this day is to be understood by the word politics He was ever a friend to government in a general sense of the term as knowing what benefits society derives from it and was never tempted to write on the side of what is called opposition but at a period of his life when experience had not enabled him to judge of the motives which induce men to assume the characters of patriots In the year he saw with indignation the methods which in the business of Wilkes were taken to work upon the populace and in published a pamphlet intitled  'The false alarm'  wherein he asserts and labours to shew by a variety of arguments founded on precedents that the expulsion of a member of the house of  commons for such offences as he had been convicted of was both just and seasonable and that no such calamity as the subversion of the constitution was to be feared from an act that had usage which is the law of parliament to warrant it The nonacquiescence of the people interested in the question is therefore branded by him with folly and madness in the following animated expressions  'Every artifice of sedition has been since practised to awaken discontent and inflame indignation The papers of every day have been filled with the exhortations and menaces of faction The madness has spread through all ranks and both sexes women and children have clamoured for Mr Wilkes honest simplicity has been cheated into fury and only the wise have escaped the infection'  To ridicule the conduct of opposition he adopts a term invented by the leaders thereof and calls the conjuncture of events at the time of which he is speaking an  alarming crisis  but endeavours to abate the fears of its termination by alluding to parliamentary decisions apparently partial and sometimes oppressive and shewing that the vexation excited by injustice suffered or supposed to be suffered by any private man or single community was local and temporary This position he illustrates by the following observation  'We have found by experience that though a squire has given ale and venison in vain and a borough has been compelled to see its dearest interests in the hands of him whom it did not trust yet the general state of the nation has continued the same The sun has risen and the corn has grown and whatever talk has been of the danger of property  yet he that ploughed the field commonly reaped it and he that built the house was master of the door'  In a tone more grave he addresses such as are capable of conviction and tells themthat  'they have as much happiness as the condition of life will easily receive and that a government of which an erroneous or unjust representation of one county only is the greatest crime that interest can discover or malice can upbraid is a government approaching nearer to perfection than any that experience has shewn or history related'  The pamphlet concludes with some shrewd remarks on the support given to faction by the sectaries and that frigid neutrality of the tories in this business which he censures in these words  'They do not yet consider that they have at last a king who knows not the name of a party and who wishes to be the common father of his people'  It was not to be imagined that a publication so unpopular as this would long remain unanswered Of many answers to it one alone seemed to Johnson worthy of a reply but in a consultation with his friends he was advised to forbear Had he engaged in a vindication of  'The false alarm'  the world might possibly have been entertained with a specimen of his abilities in controversial writing in which there is little doubt that he would have displayed the temper and perspicuity of Hooker the strength of Chillingworth and the dexterity of Hoadly though in truth he was no friend to controversy  his opinion on that subject being that it seldom produced conviction that an impotent argument against a book was best resuted by silence and that it is want of policy to give immortality to that which must of itself expire  In the next succeeding year a subject of more general importance to the interests of this country engaged his attention it was a question between us and the court of Spain touching the prediscovery and consequently the right of dominion over certain islands in the South seas known to us by the name of Pepys's or Falkland's islands and to the Spaniards by that of the Malouines spots of earth so inconsiderable as Johnson asserts that in the desert of the ocean they had almost escaped human notice and which if they had not happened to make a seamark had perhaps never had a name Lord Anson in his voyage had noticed these islands and the relator thereof had recommended them as necessary to the success of any future expedition against the coast of Chili and of such importance that the possession of them would produce many advantages in peace and in war would make us masters of the South sea In our ministry sent out a few sloops for a fuller knowledge of Pepy's and Falkland's islands and for further discoveries in the South sea but upon a remonstrance of Wall the Spanish ambassador here maintaining the right of his master to the exclusive dominion of the South sea they relinquished part of their original design and our purpose of settling there was disowned Thus the matter rested till lord Egmont was appointed to the  direction of our naval operations who in the year sent out an expedition the commander whereof took possession of Falkland's island in the name of his Britannic majesty and placed a garrison in a place of defence to which he gave the appellation of Port Egmont In this settlement we were soon after disturbed for Madariaga a Spanish commodore with five frigates and a train of artillery appearing before the island obliged our people to capitulate and obtained possession This event was no sooner known at our court than hostilities against Spain were resolved on and a powerful fleet was assembled these preparations brought on a conference between prince Masserano the Spanish ambassador here and our minister and a subsequent negociation at Madrid between Mr Harris our minister there and the marquis Grimaldi the result was a disavowal on the part of Spain of the violent enterprise of Buccarelli the governor of Buenos Ayres who had sent the force that dispossessed the English and a promise to restore the port and fort called Egmont with all the artillery and stores therein but with a declaration that this engagement should not affect the question of the prior right of sovereignty of the Malouine otherwise called Falkland's islands  The conference at London was with lord Rochford then secretary of state for the southern department who in discourse with me gave an account of it to this effect viz that he represented to the Spanish ambassador that the inflexibility of his court in this business had compelled us to arm that our fleet was manned and the officers and sailors impatient for action that the nation having incurred the expence of a naval equipment would hardly be satisfied without a trial of what it was able to effect and that a refusal of concessions on the part of Spain would inevitably bring on a war between the two powers which as it would be confined to the sea must prove a short one    The acquiescence of our court in these concessions of that of Madrid and the reference of a disputable question to the Greek calends furnished the leaders of faction with a new topic for clamour and war became the cry The heavy burthen of debt incurred by the last was no reason against a new one and millions were to be expended and thousands murdered for the titular sovereignty of an island which Johnson thus strongly and even poetically characterises  'A bleak and gloomy solitude an island thrown aside from human use stormy in winter and barren in summer an island which not the southern savages have dignified with habitation where a garrison must be kept in a state that contemplates with envy the exiles of Siberia of which the expence will be perpetual and the use only occasional and which if fortune smile upon our labours may become a nest of smugglers in peace and in war the future refuge of buccaniers'  These are his sentiments respecting the incommodities of this contested settlement against the advantages suggested by the relator of Anson's expedition whom he represents as having written under the influence of a heated imagination he opposes the following arguments founded in true policy and sound morality  'That such a settlement may be of use in war no man that considers its situation will deny But war is not the whole business of life it happens but  seldom and every man either good or wise wishes that its frequency were still less That conduct which betrays designs of future hostility if it does not excite violence will always generate malignity it must for ever exclude confidence and friendship and continue a cold and sluggish rivalry by a sly reciprocation of indirect injuries without the bravery of war or the security of peace  'The advantage of such a settlement in time of peace is I think not easily to be proved For what use can it have but of a station for contraband traders a nursery of fraud and a receptacle of theft Narborough about a century ago was of opinion that no advantages could be obtained in voyages to the South sea except by such an armament as with a sailor's morality  might trade by force  It is well known that the prohibitions of commerce are in these countries to the last degree rigorous and that no man not authorized by the king of Spain can trade there but by force or stealth Whatever profit is obtained must be gained by the violence of rapine or dexterity of fraud  'Government will not perhaps soon arrive at such purity and excellence but that some connivance at least will be indulged to the triumphant robber and successful cheat He that brings wealth home is seldom interrogated by what means it was obtained This however is one of those modes of corruption with which mankind ought always to struggle and which they may in time hope to overcome There is reason to expect that as the world is more enlightened policy and morality will at last be reconciled  and that nations will learn not to do what they would not suffer  'But the silent toleration of suspected guilt is a degree of depravity far below that which openly incites and manifestly protects it To pardon a pirate may be injurious to mankind but how much greater is the crime of opening a port in which all pirates will be safe The contraband trader is not more worthy of protection if with Narborough he trades by force he is a pirate if he trades secretly he is only a thief Those who honestly refuse his traffic he hates as obstructors of his profit and those with whom he deals he cheats because he knows that they dare not complain He lives with a heart full of that malignity which fear of detection always generates in those who are to defend unjust acquisitions against lawful authority and when he comes home with riches thus acquired he brings a mind hardened in evil too proud for reproof and too stupid for reflection he offends the high by his insolence and corrupts the low by his example'  To silence this clamour to defeat the purposes of a wicked and malevolent faction to allay the thirst for human blood and to bring the deluded people to a sense of their true interest was the aim of Johnson in writing this most judicious pamphlet he succeeded in his endeavour the miseries of war were averted the contractors disappointed and a few months restored the populace to the use of their understandings  In a review of the several particulars herein before related it will appear that Johnson's course of life  was very uniform London was a place of residence which he preserred to all others as affording more intelligence and better opportunities of conversation than were elsewhere to be found and he was but little delighted either with rural scenes or manners Novelty and variety of occupations it is true were objects that engaged his attention and from these he never failed to extract information Though born and bred in a city he well understood both the theory and practice of agriculture and even the management of a farm he could describe with great accuracy the process of malting and had necessity driven him to it could have thatched a dwelling Of field recreations such as hunting setting and shooting he would discourse like a sportsman though his personal defects rendered him in a great measure incapable of deriving pleasure from any such exercises  But he had taken a very comprehensive view of human life and manners and that he was well acquainted with the views and pursuits of all classes and characters of men his writings abundantly shew This kind of knowledge he was ever desirous of increasing even as he advanced in years to gratify it he was accessible to all comers and yielded to the invitations of such of his friends as had residences in the country to vary his course of living and pass the pleasanter months of the year in the shades of obscurity  In these visits where there were children in the family he took great delight in examining them as to their progress in learning or to make use of a  term almost obsolete of apposing them  To appose signifies to put questions Ingulphus abbot of Croyland who was educated in the old school of the abbey of Westminster relates that he was frequently examined in this manner by Editha the wife of Edward the confessor  'Vidi ego illam multotiens cum patrem meum in regis curia morantem adhuc puer inviserem et saepius mihi de scholis venienti de literis ac versu meo apponebat cum occurrerem et libentissime de grammatica solidirate ad logicam levitatem qua callebat declinans cum argumentorum subtili ligamine me conclusisset semper tribus aut quatuor nummis per ancillulam numeratis ad regium penu transmisit et resectum dimisit'  Ingulphi historia inter scriptores post Bedam edit Lond p a  Which passage Stow in his annals has thus rendered  'I have seen her saith Ingulphus then when being yet but a boy I came to see my father dwelling in the king's court And often coming from school when I met her she would appose me touching my learning and lesson and falling from grammar to logicke wherein she had some knowledge would subtilly conclude an argument with me and by a handmaiden give three or foure peeces of money and send me unto the place where I should receive some victuals and so be dismissed'  To this purpose I once heard him say that in a visit to Mrs Percy who had the care of one of the young princes at the queen's house the prince of Wales being then a child came into the room and began to play about when Johnson with his usual curiosity took an opportunity of asking him what books he was reading and in particular enquired as to his knowledge of the Scriptures the prince in his answers gave him great satisfaction and as to the last said that part of his daily exercises was to read Ostervald In many families into which he went the fathers were often desirous of producing their sons to him for his opinion of their parts and of the proficiency they had  made at school which in frequent instances came out to be but small He once told me that being at the house of a friend whose son in his schoolvacation was come home the father spoke of this child as a lad of pregnant parts and said that he was well versed in the classics and acquainted with history in the study whereof he took great delight Having this information Johnson as a test of the young scholar's attainments put this question to him  'At what time did the heathen oracles cease'  The boy not in the least daunted answered  'At the dissolution of religious houses'  By the exercise of such offices as these by his disposition to encourage children in their learning and joining admonition to instruction to exhort them to obedience to their parents and teachers Johnson r  ndered himself a welcome guest in all the families into which he was admitted and in various ways did he employ his talents in the gratification of his friends A gentleman with whom he had maintained a long and strict friendship had the misfortune to lose his wife and wished Johnson from the outlines of her ch  racter which he should give him and his own knowledge of her worth to compose a monumental inscription for her he returned the husband thanks for the confidence he placed in him and acquitted himself of the task in the following fine eulogium now to be seen in the parish church of Watford in Hertfordshire  In the vault below are deposited the remains of  JANE BELL wife of JOHN BELL  Esq  who in the fiftythird year of her age  surrounded with many worldly blessings  heard with fortitude and composure truly great  the horrible malady which had for some time begun to  afflict her  pronounced incurable  and for more than three years  endured with patience and concealed with decency  the daily tortures of gradual death  continued to divide the hours not allotted to devotion  between the cares of her family and the converse of  her friends  rewarded the attendance of duty  and acknowledged the offices of affection  and while she endeavoured to alleviate by chearfulness  her husband's sufferings and sorrows  increased them by her gratitude for his care  and her solicitude for his quiet  To the memory of these virtues  more highly honoured as more familiarly known  this monument is erected by  JOHN BELL  She died in the month of October    He had long been solicited by Mr James Boswell a native of Scotland and one that highly valued him to accompany him in a journey to the Hebrides or Western islands of that kingdom as to a part of the world in which nature was to be viewed in her rudest and most terrific form and where whatever was  wanting to delight the eye or soothe the imagination was made up by objects that could not fail to expand it and turn delight into astonishment and being now in the year his own master having no literary engagement to fulfil he accepted the invitation He began the tour proposed in the autumn of the year abovementioned and computing from the eighteenth day of August when he left Edinburgh to the ninth of November when he returned thither completed it in seven weeks and six days and at his return to England drew up and published an account of it  The Western islands of Scotland are called by the ancient geographers the Aebudae and Hebrides The Scotch historians namely Hector Boethius bishop Lesly Buchanan and Johnson have given us little more concerning them than their names Camden has given a general but brief description of them and speaks of their number as about fortyfour but bishop Gibson adds that they have been reckoned at three hundred in which computation every spot or islet must be supposed to be included but a particular description of the Western islands was wanting to the world till the year when a person of the name of Martin published a book with that title containing a full account of those islands and of the government religion and customs of the inhabitants thereof and also  'of the second sight or faculty of foreseeing things by vision so common among them'  Of this writer little more is known than that of which himself seems to be the relator viz that he was born in one of the most  spacious  and  fertile  isles  in the west of Scotland and besides his liberal education at the university had the advantage of seeing foreign places and conversing with some of the royal society but who nevertheless seems to have been a very weak credulous and superstitious man and notwithstanding his liberal education with respect both to matter and form an injudicious writer The same person had a few years before made a voyage to St Kilda the most remote of the Western islands and in published a description thereof  The defects of Martin in the accounts given by him of the Hebrides and the inhabitants of the several isles so called are amply supplied by a late traveller thither Mr Pennant who in the years and made the tour of Scotland and with a curious and penetrating eye remarked all that seems to have been worthy of notice respecting either the situation of the spots by him described or the people whom necessity has doomed or particular circumstances have led to become dwellers there  The extent of these islands from north to south is computed at two hundred miles and their medium width such as were they one continent would make a country as large as Scotland Of the inhabitants those of St Kilda for instance some are Christians resembling both in their religious tenets and the purity of their lives those of the primitive times others are of the Romish communion and the rest are of that denomination of protestants who adhere to the reformation of that furious bigot John Knox The civil constitution of these several tracts of land for countries they are not to be called is uniform  it is feudatory and of this the many castles and places of defence every where visible among them in which their lords and chieftains reside are evident proofs In extent of land they differ greatly Sky the largest of them is above sixty measured miles long but the greater number of them are less than four miles in length and two in breadth Iona or Icolmkill is but two miles long and one broad yet it was once an episcopal seat and had on it a cathedral and a place of sepulture in which no fewer than fortyeight Scottish eight Norwegian and four Irish kings are interred and also two monastic establishments the one for men the other for women the ruins of these edifices are yet remaining and may be seen accurately delineated in Mr Pennant's  'Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides'  made in and published in Others of these isles are yet smaller Cannay is three miles by one and Staffa is a mile long and half a mile broad and has but one house  The situation of these islands in the bosom of the deep exposed to howling winds and beating waves that excavate their very foundations and rains whose intermission is little more than casual together with the inconveniences of an excision from the continent is a circumstance so much against them as to deprive the inhabitants of many of the greatest social comforts and the possibility of subsisting under the want of them is hardly conceivable It is true that in some of the islands nearest the continent the necessaries and some of the luxuries of life are attainable by a communication with the nearest shore but extreme indigence is the lot of all the islanders excepting their  chieftains and the proprietors of land held in feudal subjection immediately under them In the subordinate ranks the condition of the people is so forlorn and destitute that were it not that they are as virtuous and innocent as they are poor they must be deemed the most wretched inhabitants of the earth  Martin a writer that in mere matters of fact may be trusted in his voyage to St Kilda relates a variety of particulars respecting that island and the inhabitants thereof Of the island he says that it is two miles long one broad and five in circumference and is one hard rock with earth from six inches to three foot deep but with not a tree nor even a shrub thereon Of the inhabitants and their manner of living he gives a description which being abridged has furnished the following account They are computed at about one hundred and eighty they observe the christian Sabbath and believe in God the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost and have three chapels covered with thatch and in one of them a brazen crucifix on which they swear and contract matrimony they speak the Erse language are charitable to each other and shew great humanity to shipwrecked strangers The head of the MacLeod family is the proprietor of the island who governs it by his steward Though they have sheep and a few oxen their chief food is Solan geese and their eggs both which they come at by climbing the rocks at the peril of their lives to take them they are suspended from the precipices by ropes of an immense length covered with salted cowhides of which there are only three on the island which are the joint property of all the dwellers thereon When they climb the rocks it is with their elbows their backs being to the rock The dress of the women is partly linen and partly plaid they wear shoes only in winter and those the skins of the neck of the Solan goose that part which covers the head of the fowl serving for the heel Their bread is made of barley or oats and their drink water or whey They have only one steel and tinderbox on the whole island and that is private property The women are beautiful and innocent and the inhabitants in general courteous their ordinary form of salutation  'God save you'  In common with the people of the northern regions they have a vein of poetry that is to say a faculty in rhyming and are lovers of music and dancing but know no instrument save the jews' harp  The same author in his latter publication  'The description of the Western isles'  gives a pleasant account of an inhabitant of St Kilda who being prevailed on to accompany some traders to Glasgow was astonished at the length of the voyage and the prospect of that city His relation is as follows  'Upon his arrival at Glasgow he was like one that had dropped from the clouds into a new world whose language habit c were in all respects new to him he never imagined that such big houses of stone were made with hands and for the pavements of the streets he thought it must needs be altogether natural for he could not believe that men would be at the pains to beat stones into the ground to walk upon He stood dumb at the door of his lodging with the greatest admiration and when he saw a coach and two horses he thought it to be a little house they were drawing at their tail with men in it but he condemned the coachman for a sool to sit so uneasy for he thought it safer to sit on the horse's back The mechanism of the coachwheel and its running about was the greatest of all his wonders  'When he went through the streets he desired to have one to lead him by the hand Thomas Ross a merchant and others that took the diversion to carry him through the town asked his opinion of the high church He answered that it was a large rock yet there were some in St Kilda much higher but that these were the best caves he ever saw for that was the idea which he conceived of the pillars and arches upon which the church stands When they carried him into the church he was yet more surprised and held up his hands with admiration wondering how it was possible for men to build such a prodigious fabric which he supposed to be the largest in the universe He could not imagine what the pews were designed for and he fancied the people that wore masks not knowing whether they were men or women had been guilty of some ill thing for which they dared not shew their faces He was amazed at women's wearing patches and fancied them to have been blisters Pendants seemed to him the most ridiculous of all things he condemned perriwigs mightily and much more the powder used in them in fine he condemned all things as superfluous he saw not in his own country He looked with amazement on every thing that was new to him When he heard the church bells ring he was under a mighty consternation as if the fabric of the world had been in great disorder He did not think there had been so many people in the world as in the city of Glasgow and it was a great mystery to him to think what they could all design by living so many in one place He wondered how they could all be furnished with provision and when he saw big loaves he could not tell whether they were bread stone or wood He was amazed to think how they could be provided with ale for he never saw any there that drank water He wondered how they made them fine cloaths and to see stockings made without being first cut and afterwards sewn was no small wonder to him He thought it foolish in women to wear thin silks as being a very improper habit for such as pretended to any sort of employment When he saw the womens' feet he judged them to be of another shape than those of the men because of the different shape of their shoes He did not approve of the heels of shoes worn by men or women and when he observed horses with shoes on their feet and fastened with iron nails he could not sorbear laughing and thought it the most ridiculous thing that ever fell under his observation He longed to see his native country again and passionately wished it were blessed with ale brandy tobacco and iron as Glasgow was'    The circumstances of discrimination between these people and the rest of mankind are so many and their characters by consequence so different their manners and customs so singular and their mode of life so inconsistent with all that can be conceived even in the lowest degree of civilization that we are not to seek  for the motives which at different times have induced travellers to visit them  The islands which Johnson and his friend saw though few in comparison with the whole number  were some of the most considerable of the Hebrides and his manner of describing them and the inhabitants as also his reception is entertaining but it is not enough particular to render it intelligible to a stranger In the relation of historical facts and local circumstances Johnson delighted not whatever intelligence came in his way furnished him with matter for reflection and his book is rather a disquisition on Hebridian manners than such a description of the islands and the people as it was in his power to give  As an instance of Johnson's inattention to historical facts let me mention his account of Icolmkill  Martin says that the word  Kill  in the Irish or Erse language signifies a church if then we reject the preposition  I  and call it Columkill we seem to have an intelligible name for it i e Columb's church island He farther relates that the churches and the monastery were by the kings of Scotland endowed with revenues to the amount of marks a year But whoever wishes for satisfaction in this and many other particulars respecting this island will receive it in the perusal of Mr Pennant's Voyage to the Hebrides  called also Iona which though introduced by a sentiment that is admired for its piety and pathos of expression is so abrupt as to displease He calls it that illustrious island which was once the luminary of the Caledonian regions whence savage clans and roving barbarians derived the benefits of knowledge and the blessings of religion but who can read thus much concerning a spot so dignified without wishing that the author had mentioned a few of those historical particulars on which his reflections are founded He might have told us from Bede that the island takes its name from Columb an abbot who about  the year came from Ireland and preached the Gospel to the northern Picts and was called the apostle of the Picts and that Melischen their king being converted to the faith of Christ gave the abbot the isle of Iona by Bede called Hy or Hu who built two churches thereon in one whereof he is interred and also a monastery  Bede flourished about and may be said to speak from recent authority Bishop Gibson has recognised his account and adds that in a little village here or hereabout named Sodor or as others call it Soa a bishop's see was erected from which all the adjacent isles including Iona took the name of Sodorenses the jurisdiction thereof he elsewhere says was given to the bishop of the isle of Man and hence arises the compound appellative bishop of Sodor and Man In the first of these particulars he however stands corrected in a relation cited by Mr Pennant and founded on good authority purporting that during the time that the Norwegians were in possession of the isles they divided them into two parts the northern which comprehended all that lay to the north of a certain promontory and were therefore called the Norderys and the southern which were those that lay to the south thereof and were for a similar reason called the Suderys Voyage to the Hebrides  I have some reason to think that in writing the account of his journey to the Western islands Johnson had in his eye one of the most delightful books of the like kind in our language  'Maundrell's journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem'  The motives that induced him to undertake a labour so formidable to a  man of his age as his tour must be thought I will not enquire into doubtless curiosity was one of them but it was curiosity directed to no peculiar object He was neither an antiquary nor a naturalist he had little acquaintance with the treasures which lie below the surface of the earth and for the study of botany he never discovered the least relish If any particular subject may be said to have engaged his attention it must have been the manners of a people of whom he knew little but by report the knowledge whereof might furnish him with new topics for reflection and disquisition an exercise of his mental powers which of all others he most delighted in That in this employment he has conducted himself with that impartiality which becomes a lover of truth the natives of the kingdom he visited deny and that he carried out of this country the temper of a man who hoped for an hospitable reception among strangers few are so hardy as to assert Accordingly we find in his narrative an intermixture not only of praise and blame but of gratitude and invective  The volume which this tour gave birth to may properly be called a dissertation for it has scarcely any facts and consists chiefly in propositions which he hunts down and enlivens with amusing disquisition As he says himself on another occasion the negative catalogue of particulars is very copious what he did not see what he could not learn what he would not believe what he did not enquire about and what he is not sure of altogether form a considerable enumeration Yet the merit of this tract is great for though I will admit that no one going his route could derive from him direction or intelligence though no remembrance  could be refreshed nor remarks corroborated because his web was spun not from objects that presented themselves to his view but from his own preexistent ideas I am convinced that every body must have regretted the omission had he for any reason withheld so entertaining a series of reflections  A reference to the work will discover both the cause and effect of the confined observation that must be remarked in it he pofesses his views to be directed to life and manners of the former if taken in its general sense he could obtain a very inadequate knowledge who was entertained by the opulent at the best houses with the best fare of the country and who while he suffered no inconvenience within doors enquired after little without and of the latter he could gain little information for the manners he most closely observed were imported from the places where southern elegance is taught His known love of ease precluded him from intelligence all deficiencies by which he could suffer the natural hospitality of those to whom he was a guest temporarily supplied or concealed and happy was it for him that he found not the same prejudices that he carried with him  In all Johnson's disquisitions whether argumentative or critical there is a certain evenhanded justice that leaves the mind in a strange perplexity When he speaks of the paucity of trees in Scotland his indignation seems excited at the supineness it manifested He says  'to drop a seed into the ground can cost nothing and the trouble is not great of protecting the young plant till it is out of danger'  In this the reader willingly acquiesces and wonders with  Johnson that plantation is neglected till he is told in the conclusion of the paragraph that it must be allowed difficult where there is neither wood for palisades nor thorns for hedges He again in a subsequent page resumes the same kind of satirical admiration which he balances by observing that the land which covers future forests cannot be arable This also is satisfactory the question of first importance certainly isWhere shall  corn  growno one will deny that food must be secured before the delights of foliage or the emoluments of timber are thought of But all our wonder and regret at national inactivity is dissipated when we are told that Sir James Macdonald had made an experiment by planting several millions of trees which the want of fences to keep the cattle off had rendered abortive Thus it is that he frequently raises an edifice which appears founded and supported to resist any attack and then with the next stroke annihilates it and leaves the vacuity he found  With respect to the inaccuracy he has been charged with it must in justice be imputed to the defect of his perceptions he neither saw nor heard clearly and though this might be urged against his attempting to relate what he had met with or been told it must be admitted in excuse for any misrepresentation since no one could acquire credit by doubting the uniform veracity of Johnson He candidly confesses his inability whenever he suspected it and owns that his thoughts are the thoughts of one who has seen little  I wish I could as readily apologize for the manner in which he speaks of the people of that part of Scotland  he visited He seems to think a barren soil disgraceful to the proprietors and his aversion is most excited where he finds the comforts of life most sparingly bestowed where he meets with refinement he is placid and is unwilling to depart from elegance but when he is displeased or unsatisfied he expresses himself with a keenness of satire which however it may delight by its poignancy is not to be justified and I have reason to think very highly not only of the kindness which consulted his humour but of that temper and forbearance which restrained those persons who while they were endeavouring to gratify him received indubitable proof of his antipathy to their country  But it is due to him to take notice that in civility he has preserved the same equilibrium as in argument If he has stigmatized Scotland as a country and the Scots as a people his compliments to individuals in some measure atone for it they are judicious elegant and well conceived and express the sense of gratitude proportioned to the favours he experienced  I will not repeat for I do not wish to perpetuate those passages that have given disgust I have ever esteemed the Scots as a brave useful and virtuous people and should be very sorry if they imagined Johnson's prejudices common to their southern neighbours If in his journey across their continent he had remembered that a very commendable and welldirected spirit of literary industry had distinguished them and when among the Hebridians that a perpetual struggle against difficulties and a patient toleration of irremediable evils is eminently  laudable I am persuaded he would have written with less asperity and that his remarks would not have given that offence which I cannot but own well founded  It is no less to be lamented that he left not behind him those prejudices against the ecclesiastical establishment of Scotland and the religious persuasion of the people which though in England they gave little offence could not in that kingdom be indulged without the suspicion of bigotry It is pretty well agreed that between the church of England and that of Scotland the questions in dispute relate not to doctrines but to discipline which in the judgment of many sober persons is numbered among things indifferent Being in a country of which Christianity in its utmost purity is the religion it might have been expected that Johnson with a true catholic spirit and as a testimony of respect for their teachers would occasionally have been present at divine service in their churches but his narrative contains not the least hint of any such compliance though he has noted his joining in public worship at the English nonjuring episcopal chapel at Aberdeen  For this condescension he would have had the example of Mr Richard Baxter a man whom he professed to admire who as I have been credibly informed to testify his charity towards those from whom he dissented in opinion was wont once in every year to communicate with the established church    From a tour to which he had no stronger an incentive from which he was so little able to extract pleasure and which had occasioned a suspension of the enjoyments he found in a metropolis it seems at first wonderful that he should have returned satisfied  that he did so is certain and it must be attributed to the gratification he felt in the respect that had been paid to him in seeing the celebrity he had acquired and in increasing the stock of his ideas  Had Johnson been more explicit in his acknowledgments of the hospitable and courteous treatment he experienced from a people who had reason to look on him rather as a spy than a traveller and might have said to him  'To discover the nakedness of the land are ye come'  he would have given a proof that he had in some degree overcome his prejudices against them and their country but they seemed to be unconquerable  One of the last duties we learn is that of considering mankind as one great family and the natives of foreign countries however differing from us in opinions manners customs and other particulars as standing in the same relation with ourselves to the common Father of us all a duty which leads us as Thompson elegantly expresses it to  'scan our nature with a brother's eye'  Johnson's prejudices were too strong to permit him to extend his philanthropy much beyond the limits of his native country and the pale of his own church and that he was unable to conquer his habits of thinking and judging is the only apology that can be offered for his asperity towards the people whose country and manners he in his journey above spoken of has taken upon him to describe or that he has forborne to display any such generous sentiments respecting the inhabitants of Scotland as others have done who have visited that country  In the close of his book he might have at large expressed some sense of gratitude for the many courtesies that had been shewn him He might at least have said  'the barbarous people shewed us much kindness'  but the last paragraph is frigid and unanimated to an excess of affectation and must ever suffer by a comparison with the conclusion of Mr Pennant's Tour which as well for its elegance as the benevolent spirit which it evidences I here insert  'I look back to the North and with a grateful mind acknowledge every benefit I received from the remotest of the Hebrides to the present spot whether I think of the hospitality of the rich or the efforts of unblameable poverty straining every nerve to accommodate me amidst dreary hills and ungenial skies The little accidents of diet or of lodging affect not me I look farther than the mere differences of living or of customs to the good heart and extensive benevolence which softens every hardship and turns into delicacies the grossest fare My constitution never yet was disposed to apathy for which I can claim no merit but am thankful to the author of my frame'  And in a quotation from the Religio Medici of Sir Thomas Brown he adds  "I feel not in myself those common antipathies that I can discover in others those national repugnancies do not touch me nor do I behold with prejudice the French Italian Spaniard or Dutch much more my fellowsubjects howsoever remotely placed from me But where I find their actions in balance with my countrymen's I honour love and embrace them in  some degree I was born in the right climate but seem to be framed and constellated unto all all places all airs make unto me one country I am in England every where and under every meridian"  I must here observe as it was a circumstance that gave him some trouble after his return to England that during his stay in the Hebrides Johnson was very industrious in his enquiries touching the Earse language with a view to ascertain the degree of credit due to certain poems then lately published and ascribed to Ossian an ancient bard who till then had scarce been heard of His opinion upon the question of their genuineness is pretty decisive and will appear best in his own words  'I suppose my opinion of the poems of Ossian is already discovered I believe they never existed in any other form than that which we have seen The editor or author never could shew the original  Johnson had required that it should be deposited in either the king's or the marischal college at Aberdeen and submitted to public inspection but this was never done  nor can it be shewn by any other To revenge reasonable incredulity by refusing evidence is a degree of insolence with which the world is not yet acquainted and stubborn audacity is the last refuge of guilt It would be easy to shew it if he had it but whence could it be had It is too long to be remembered and the language formerly had nothing written He has doubtless inserted names that circulate in popular stories and may have translated some wandering ballads if any can be found and the names and some of the images being recollected  make an inaccurate auditor imagine by the help of Caledonian bigotry that he has formerly heard the whole  'I asked a very learned minister in Sky who had used all arts  make me believe the genuineness of the book wh  ther at last he believed it himself but he would no  answer He wished me to be deceived for the honour of his country but would not directly and formally deceive me Yet has this man's testimony been publicly produced as of one that held Fingal to be the work of Ossian  'It is said that some men of integrity profess to have heard parts of it but they all heard them when they were boys and it was never said that any of them could recite six lines They remember names and perhaps some proverbial sentiments and having no distinct ideas coin a resemblance without an original The persuasion of the Scots however is far from universal and in a question so capable of proof why should doubt be suffered to continue The editor has been heard to say that part of the poem was received by him in the Saxon character He has then found by some peculiar fortune an unwritten language written in a character which the natives probably never beheld  'I have yet supposed no imposture but in the publisher yet I am far from certainty that some translations have not been lately made that may now be obtruded as parts of the original work Credulity on one part is a strong temptation to deceit on the other especially to deceit of which no personal injury is the consequence and which flatters  the author with his own ingenuity The Scots have something to plead for their easy reception of an improbable fiction they are seduced by their fondness for their supposed ancestors A Scotchman must be a very sturdy moralist who does not love Scotland better than truth he will always love it better than inquiry and if falshood flatters his vanity will not be very diligent to detect it Neither ought the English to be much influenced by Scotch authority for of the past and present state of the whole Earse nation the Lowlanders are at least as ignorant as ourselves To be ignorant is painful but it is dangerous to quiet our uneasiness by the delusive opiate of hasty persuasion  'But this is the age in which those who could not read have been supposed to write in which the giants of antiquated romance have been exhibited as realities If we know little of the ancient Highlanders let us not fill the vacuity with Ossian If we have not searched the Magellanick regions let us however forbear to people them with Patagons'  No sooner did this strong and unequivocal declaration of Johnson's opinion of the poems of Ossian appear than Mr James Macpherson the publisher of them not only repelled the charge of forgery therein contained but in a letter to the author of it threatened him with corporal chastisement If Mr Macpherson had known his man he would probably have forborne the thought of such a revenge To shew his contempt of him and all that he was able to do that could hurt him Johnson returned the following brief but spirited answer  No date  Mr JAMES MACPHERSON  I received your foolish and impudent letterAny violence that shall be attempted upon me I will do my best to repel and what I cannot do for myself the law shall do for me for I will not be hindered from exposing what I think a cheat by the menaces of a ruffian What would you have me retract I thought your work an imposition I think so still and for my opinion I have given reasons which I here dare you to refuteYour abilities since your Homer are not so formidable and what I hear of your morality inclines me to credit rather what you shall prove than what you shall say  Whether Johnson was apprehensive that his adversary would put his threat in execution or that he meant to shew all who came to see him that he stood upon his guard he provided himself with a weapon both of the defensive and offensive kind It was an oakplant of a tremendous size a plant I say and not a shoot or branch for it had had a root which being trimmed to the size of a large orange became the head of it Its height was upwards of six feet and from about an inch in diameter at the lower end increased to near three this he kept in his bedchamber so near the chair in which he constantly sat as to be within reach  But this precaution for his defence turned out to be unnecessary Johnson's letter above inserted put an end to the dispute between him and Macpherson but by other persons it was continued with a degree of asperity equal to that which was shewn in the controversy  concerning the genuineness of Phalaris's epistles and with as much acuteness as that which tended to ascertain the question whether the poems lately ascribed to Rowlie are not forgeries Moderators have also interposed as there did in the dispute about the authenticity of the Sybilline oracles and with as little success the world remains and is likely ever to remain without satisfaction in respect of either the one or the other  Before this time Johnson had undertaken to revise the former edition of his Shakespeare and extend his plan by admitting the corrections and illustrations of various other commentators He therefore in conjunction with Mr George Steevens published in a new edition of that author in ten octavo volumes which was republished with additions in  In the parliament having been dissolved and Mr Wilkes persisting in his endeavours to become a representative in that which was about to be chosen Johnson addressed to the electors of Great Britain a pamphlet entitled  'The Patriot'  the design whereof is to guard them from imposition and teach them to distinguish that which of itself seems sufficiently obvious the difference between true and false patriotism but the madness of the people was then at its height and they needed to be told how often in their lucid intervals they had lamented the deceits practised on them by artful and designing men With this view he describes a patriot as one whose public conduct is regulated by one single motive the love of his country who as an agent in parliament has for himself neither hope nor fear neither kindness nor resentment but refers every  thing to the common interest These and other marks of patriotism by him pointed out he allows to be such as artifice may counterfeit or folly misapply but he enumerates several characteristical modes of speaking and acting which may prove a man not to be a patriot which discrimination he illustrates in sundry instances by pointed references to the conduct of many of those men who were courting the favour of the people these an abridgment would injure and I therefore give them in his own words  'It may safely be pronounced that those men are no patriots who when the national honour was vindicated in the sight of Europe and the Spaniards having invaded what they call their own had shrunk to a disavowal of their attempt and a relaxation of their claim would still have instigated us to a war for a bleak and barren spot in the Magellanic ocean of which no use could be made unless it were a place of exile for the hypocrites of patriotismHe that wishes to see his country robbed of its rights cannot be a patriot That man therefore is no patriot who justifies the ridiculous claims of American usurpation who endeavours to deprive the nation of its natural and lawful authority over its own colonies those colonies which were settled under English protection were constituted by an English charter and have been defended by English arms To suppose that by sending out a colony the nation established an independent power that when by indulgence and favour emigrants are become rich they shall not contribute to their own defence but at their own pleasure and that they shall not be  included like millions of their fellow subjects in the general system of representation involves such an accumulation of absurdity as nothing but the shew of patriotism would palliate'  His last designation of the class of men whom he means to stigmatise is the following  'That man is not a patriot who denies his governors their due praise and who conceals from the public the benefits which they receive Those therefore can lay no claim to this illustrious appellation who impute want of public spirit to the late parliament an assembly of men whom notwithstanding some fluctuations of counsel and some weakness of agency the nation must always remember with gratitude since it is indebted to them for a very ample concession in the resignation of protections and a wise and honest attempt to improve the constitution in the new judicature instituted to try elections'  Johnson published also in a pamphlet intitled  'Taxation no Tyranny'  an answer to the resolutions and address of the American congress in which as the ground of his argument he assumes as selfevident the following proposition  'In all the parts of human knowledge whether terminating in science merely speculative or operating upon life private or civil are admitted some fundamental principls or common axioms which being generally received are little doubted and being little doubted have been rarely proved  'Of these gratuitous and acknowledged truths it is often the fate to become less evident by endeavours to explain them however necessary such endeavours may be made by the misapprehensions  of absurdity or the sophistries of interest It is difficult to prove the principles of science because notions cannot always be found more intelligible than those which are questioned It is difficult to prove the principles of practice because they have for the most part not been discovered by investigation but obtruded by experience and the demonstrator will find after an operose deduction that he has been trying to make that seen which can be only felt  'Of this kind is the position that  the supreme power of every community has the right of requiring from all its subjects such contributions as are necessary to the public safety or public prosperity  which was considered by all mankind as comprising the primary and essential condition of all political society till it became disputed by those zealots of anarchy who have denied to the parliament of Britain the right of taxing the American colonies'  With much wit does he ridicule and with force of reasoning refute the arguments founded on the inability of the Americans to bear taxation their powers of resistance the stubbornness of their tempers and the profits accruing to this country by its commerce with them these he tells us are used only as auxiliaries to that other which as he briefly states it is  'that to tax the colonies is usurpation and oppression an invasion of natural and legal rights and a violation of those principles which support the constitution of the English government'  He next considers the legal consequences of migration from a mothercountry and afterwards proceeds to an examination of that fallacious position that from  an Englishman nothing can be taken but by his own consent and of the argument grounded thereon that the Americans being unrepresented in parliament cannot be said to have consented in their corporate capacity and that refusing their consent as individuals they cannot legally be taxed  Of this he says that  'it is a position of a mighty sound but that every man that utters it with whatever confidence and every man that hears it with whatever acquiescence if consent be supposed to imply the power of refusal feels to be false for that in wide extended dominions the business of the public must be done by delegation and the choice of delegates is by a select number of electors who are often far from unanimity in their choice and where the numbers approach to equality almost half must be governed not only without but against their choice'  Of those who are not electors he says  'they stand idle and helpless spectators of the commonweal wholly unconcerned in the government of themselves'  The resolution of the Congress that their ancestors who first settled the colonies were at the time of their emigration from the mothercountry entitled to all the rights liberties and immunities of free and naturalborn subjects within the realm of England he admits but granting it he contends that their boast of original rights is at an end and that by their emigration they sunk down into colonists governed by a charter and that though by such emigration they had not forfeited surrendered or lost any of those rights they had lost them by natural effects that is to say had abandoned them  'A man' says he 'can be but in one place at once he cannot have the advantages  of multiplied residence He that will enjoy the brightness of sunshine must quit the coolness of the shade And though an emigrant having a right to vote for a knight or burgess by crossing the Atlantic does not nullify that right he renders the exertion of it no longer possibleBut the privileges of an American' adds he 'scorn the limits of place they are part of himself and cannot be lost by departure from his country they float in the air or glide under the ocean'  He next considers the legal operation of charters and forgets not to note that from the exemption of the first settlers in Massachuset's bay from taxes for seven years it must be inferred that at the end thereof they were liable to taxation  It is not my purpose to give at length the several arguments contained in this most excellent pamphlet I shall therefore content myself with extracting from it a few passages which stand distinguished from others either by their wit or the strength of reasoning displayed in them Of that class are these that follow  'To be prejudiced is always to be weak yet there are prejudices so near to laudable that they have often been praised and are always pardoned To love their country has been considered as virtue in men whose love could not be otherwise than blind because their preference was made without comparison but it has never been my fortune to find either in ancient or modern writers any honourable mention of those who have with equal blindness hated their country  'These antipatriotic prejudices are the abortions of folly impregnated by faction which being produced against the standing order of nature have not strength sufficient for long life They are born only to scream and perish and leave them to contempt or detestation whose kindness was employed to nurse them into mischief'  To the menaces of the heroes of Boston that they would leave their town and be free rather than submit to the stampact in which case he says they would leave good houses to wiser men he opposes this sober advice  'Yet before they quit the comforts of a warm home for the sounding something which they think better he cannot be thought their enemy who advises them to consider well whether they shall find it By turning fishermen or hunters woodmen or shepherds they may become wild but it is not so easy to conceive them free for who can be more a slave than he that is driven by force from the comforts of life is compelled to leave his house to a casual comer and whatever he does or wherever he wanders finds every moment some new testimony of his own subjection If choice of wills be freedom the felon in the gallies has his choice of labour or stripes The Bostonian may quit his house to starve in the fields his dog may refuse to set and smart under the lash and they may then congratulate each other on the smiles of liberty  profuse of bliss and pregnant with delight  Addison's letter from Italy    'To treat such designs as serious would be to think too contemptibly of Bostonian understandings The artifice indeed is not new the blusterer who threatened in vain his opponent has sometimes obtained his end by making it believed he would hang himself'  In a more serious strain of reasoning he thus argues  'Our colonies however distant have been hitherto treated as constituent parts of the British empire The inhabitants incorporated by English charters are entitled to all the rights of Englishmen They are governed by English laws entitled to English dignities regulated by English counsels and protected by English arms and it seems to follow by consequence not easily avoided that they are subject to English government and chargeable by English taxation'  The above citations are evidences of Johnson's skill in political controversy and are but slight specimens of that species of oratory which delights the ear and convinces the understanding With respect to logical precision and strength of argument the tracts from whence they are severally taken defy all comparison and as they abound in wit and discover nothing of that acrimony which disgraces former controversies the Disciplinarian and Bangorian not excepted may be considered as standing exemplars of polemical eloquence and political ratiocination  The friends of sedition and rebellion were highly exasperated against Johnson for his interfering by these publications in the debate of political questions they were provoked to see such talents as his employed in exposing the malignity of faction and detecting  the artifices of those who by specious oratory and false reasoning were courting popularity and deluding the inhabitants of this country into a resignation of their rights It was not said they for a man of his abstracted genius a philosopher a moralist and a poet to concern himself in the contentions between a parentstate and its offspring The muses gentle creatures are of no party they  in a ring  Ay round about Jove's altar sing  IL PENSEROSO  And in conformity to this character it behoved him to be a silent spectator of all that was passing and leave the agitation of political questions to men whose malevolence comprehended in it all the qualifications necessary in the course of such a warfare  In like manner did they before resent the publication by Mr Hogarth of a print called  'The Times'  the intent whereof was to unite the people and facilitate the negociations for peace The patriots in opposition to Sir Robert Walpole had in their time viz immediately after the publication of the Rake's Progress endeavoured to engage Mr Hogarth to design a series of prints to be intitled  'The Statesman's Progress'  but he scorning to prostitute his art to the purposes of faction rejected their offer    But Johnson was of another mind he was conscious of his own abilities and felt within himself such powers of reasoning such a knowledge of the principles of civil policy as qualified him for a contest not with American planters or colony agents but with tumid orators factious lawyers and interested selfish merchants And in this exercise of his pen  he was not less sincere than formidable Admitting him to be a tory he was a friend to both the ecclesiastical and civil establishment of his country and he thought it his duty as a good subject when the legislative authority was denied to refute the arguments of such as resisted it  It has been insinuated that in his vindication of the measures of government as contained in the several pamphlets before cited Johnson had an eye rather to the obligation which his pension implied than to the questions in debate This if it could be proved might be an objection to his integrity but sets him but on a level with his opponents whose apparent and known motive to opposition and clamour was the desire of popularity as a means whereby the ambitious among them hoped to attain power and the indigent to acquire places or emoluments and who will say that an itch for vulgar applause is not as corrupt a motive to an action as any that can be imputed to one in Johnson's situation But with matters of opinion motives have nothing to do arguments alone are the weapons of controversy With respect to the first pamphlet  'The False Alarm'  the question there agitated was whether the expulsion of a member of one of the houses of parliament by a majority of votes imported a design on the liberties of the people and impartial posterity which must decide upon it will look no farther than to the reasoning of each party  Of those who endeavour at this time to excite suspicions of this nature it may be truly said that they understand neither the constitution nor the politics of this country nor do they know that the former  is now so amended by the concessions which since the restoration have been made by the crown to the people that less is to be feared from princes or their ministers who are ever responsible for their conduct than from artful and designing men stimulated by ambition or provoked by disappointment and furnished with the fascinating powers of popular eloquence  I forbear to animadvert on the two next succeeding pamphlets  'Falkland's islands'  and  'The Patriot'  but shall observe that the last of the four  'Taxation no Tyranny'  has not only never received an answer but the converse of the proposition has never yet been so proved by arguments founded on legal principles as to make a vindication of Johnson's reasoning necessary for any other purpose than that of preventing the ignorant from being misled The principle assumed by Johnson that  'the supreme power of every community has the right of requiring from all its subjects such contributions as are necessary to the public safety or public prosperity'  is as selfevident as that obedience is due from children to parents and is not refuted by the assertion that the consent of those who are required thus to contribute is necessary for were it so what becomes of the right Neither is the position that taxation and representation are correlative to be admitted as a principle of the English constitution seeing it does not nor ever did exist as a part of it and that the far greater number of the subjects of England men who are not freeholders to a certain amount copyholders who are a third of the landholders in this kingdom and all women are unrepresented in parliament and bound by laws enacted by the representatives of others but  in no sense of themselves In cities and boroughs the representation is often of the meanest of the people in London for instance where a mechanic if he be a liveryman has a vote and a freeholder wanting that qualification though assessed ever so high to the landtax has none  This assertion might possibly have place in a state about to be founded as none ever was or is likely to be on solemn agreement or that political fiction called an original contract but the constitution of a state already formed is to be taken as we find it Nor has any one of those who deny the right of a mothercountry to tax its colonies attempted to prove an exemption by any arguments than are to be found in Mr Locke's Essay on Government a discourse of general import and which applies to no existing constitution on earth  I once had a conversation on this subject with a nobleman who afterwards attained to the height of power in the administration and was against the prosecution of the American war the same who was once heard to utter this stabbing truth that the sun of Great Britain's glory was then set who went no farther than to doubt of the right above spoken of and for this doubt he had no better a reason to urge than that Cromwell in his levies on the Americans for the common service contented himself with a bare requisition of such supplies as they in their discretion should judge proportionate to their circumstances and abilities The same offer had been made by Mr Grenville to the American agents here but being kept back from their constituents it failed of its effect    The above tracts as they contain no evidence of a personal attachment of the author to those who at the respective times of their appearance had the direction of the public councils are a refutation of all those slanders which they drew on him and as  the subjects of them severally are questions of the greatest national importance sufficiently distinguish him from those hireling scribblers who in the contests of factions are retained on the side of either party and whom the vulgar style political writers In like manner did Addison and Hoadly employ their talents they were both friends of government and wrote in defence of the public measures and not only escaped obloquy but were and still are celebrated as lovers of their country  I have hitherto forborne to speak otherwise than in general terms of Johnson's political principles but the task of reviewing the tracts above cited has revived in my memory many of his sentiments which at different times he communicated to me on the subjects of government the English constitution and the motives to party opposition That he was a tory he not only never hesitated to confess but by his frequent invectives against the whigs was forward to proclaim yet was he not so besotted in his notions as to abett what is called the patriarchal scheme as delineated by Sir Robert Filmer and other writers on government nor with others of a more sober cast to acquiesce in the opinion that because submission to governors is in general terms inculcated in the Holy Scriptures the resistance of tyranny and oppression is in all cases unlawful he seemed rather to adopt the sentiments of Hooker on the subject as explained by Hoadly and by consequence to look on submission to lawful authority as a moral obligation he therefore condemned the conduct of James the second during his short reign and had he been a subject of that weak and infatuated monarch would  I am persuaded have resisted any invasion of his right or unwarrantable exertion of power with the same spirit as did the president and fellows of Magdalen college or those conscientious divines the seven bishops This disposition as it leads to whiggism one would have thought might have reconciled him to the memory of his successor whose exercise of the regal authority among us merited better returns than were made him but it had no such effect he never spoke of king William but in terms of reproach and in his opinion of him seemed to adopt all the prejudices of jacobite bigotry and rancour  For the English constitution as originally framed he ever expressed a profound reverence He understood it well and had noted in his mind the changes it had at various periods undergone that is to say first in the reign of Hen VII when the yeomanry were put into a state of competition with the nobility afterwards when by the abolition of tenures and the putting down the court of wards and liveries occasion was given to Sir Harbottle Grimston to say that in that transaction neither did the crown know what it lost nor the people what they had gained and lastly by the erecting a monied in opposition to the landed interest and the introduction of the science and practice of funding  He therefore looked not on Magna Charta as the palladium of our liberties knowing full well that excepting that chapter thereof which has been so often partially cited that is to say with the omission of the words vel per legem terrae  Nullus liber homo capiatur vel imprisonetur aut disseisietur de libero tenemento suo vel libertatibus vel liberis consuetudinibus suis aut utlegatur aut exuletur aut aliquo modo destruatur nee super eum ibimus nec super eum mittemus nisi per legale judicium parium suorum vel per legem terrae Nulli vendemus nulli negabimus aut differemus justitiam vel rectum  very little of the  whole statute will apply to the constitution in its now improved state but to the subsequent concessions of the crown in favour of the people such as are the petition of right the habeascorpus act the bill of rights and numercus other statutes of a like beneficial tendency  To partyopposition he ever expressed great aversion and of the pretences of patriots always spoke with indignation and contempt He partook of the shortlived joy that infatuated the public when Sir Robert Walpole ceased to have the direction of the national councils and trusted to the professions of Mr Pulteney and his adherents who called themselves the countryparty that all elections should thenceforward be free and uninfluenced and that bribery and corruption which were never practised but by courtiers and their agents should be no more A few weeks nay a few days convinced Johnson and indeed all England that what had assumed the appearance of patriotism was personal hatred and inveterate malice in some and in others an ambition for that power which when they had got it they knew not how to exercise A change of men and in some respect of measures took place Mr Pulteney's ambition was gratified by a peerage the wants of his associates were relieved by places and seats at the public boards and in a short time the stream of government resumed its former channel and ran with a current as even as it had ever done  Upon this development of the motives the views and the consistency of the abovementioned band of patriots Johnson once remarked to me that it had given more strength to government than all that had been written in its defence meaning thereby that it had destroyed all confidence in men of that character Little did he then think that the people of this country would again be deluded by fallacious reasoning and specious eloquence into a fruitless expenditure of near one hundred millions or that statues would ever be erected to eternize the memory of a minister of whom in he said it would be happy if the nation should dismiss him to nameless obscurity  History has been said to be philosophy teaching by example and well would it be for mankind if they would convert events into precepts and not postpone their care to prevent evils till their own experience shall have brought them home to themselves New generations of men arise in succession who in the nonage of their faculties are credulous weak and open to deceit these unhackneyed in the ways of the world trust to the professions of all who pretend a friendship for them and when they are told they are ill governed are as ready as were the Israelites of old to murmur against their rulers And let all be said that can of a principle in men invested with power to abuse it and become tyrants the history of the world will inform us that there is also a disease which the Scriptures emphatically term the madness of the people from which evils greater than from despotism are to be feared and that government even where it is best administered subsists more by force than by the consent of those who derive benefit from it  What an advantage then does this disposition in a people give to ambitious men endowed with that kind of eloquence which fascinates without conviction and while it delights stupifies  His frequent reflections on the politics of this country and the willingness of the people to be deceived had begot in Johnson such an apathy as rendered him deaf to the calls of those who were watching over our dearest rights When the cry was loudest against general warrants he took not the alarm and when they were declared illegal he protested to me that he would at no time of his life have given half a crown to be for ever indemnified against their operation The question of the legality of that kind of process is now at an end and I will not arraign the decision that condemned it but it will ever remain a question whether we have not lost more by it than we have gained and that the friends of liberty particularly the citizens of London may be enabled to discuss it I will furnish them with a few facts that I believe they have never yet been aware of  Few are so ignorant as not to know that the English manufactures excel those of all other countries but many there are who need to be told that the time may come when they shall cease to maintain that character Many of the princes of Europe have become emulous of our greatness and have long been labouring to establish in their dominions such articles of trade as should not only rival our's but in respect of cheapness gain a preference at foreign markets To this end it has for some years past been the practice of the emissaries of foreign courts by their agents and the temptation of large  premiums to engage artificers to leave this country and taking with them their wives and families as also their engines tools and implements of their respective trades to settle abroad Clothiers weavers frameworkknitters watchmakers and men of various other occupations have been the people whom they have chiefly thus inveigled and have from time to time in great numbers in ships provided and stationed for the purpose transported out of the kingdom To check this practice acts of parliament have been made which lay such emigrants under great disabilities even to the depriving them of the privileges of subjects and others that inflict heavy penalties on those that seduce them and the aid of government has been frequently implored to restrain in their flight from their native land shiploads of the most useful of all subjects The method has uniformly been upon information given at his office for a secretary of state to issue his warrant a general one that is to say without any specification of names to stop the sailing of the vessel which perhaps was lying at Wapping Ratcliff or Blackwall ready with the tide to depart Warrants of this kind seldom failed of their effect the emigrants were seized and the mischief prevented  This relief it is now not in the power of government or its ministers to grant the answer to such an application is now and must be  'General warrants have been determined to be illegal furnish us with the names of the persons whom you would have apprehended or we cannot help you  In cases where it has been possible to aid the manufacturers of this kingdom the secretaries of state are however still ready to exert the little authority which the decision on general warrants has left them as will appear by the following article of news extracted from the St James's Chronicle of the tenth of December  'Liverpool Dec Tuesday last a man was committed to jail on a charge of having in his possession a great number of machines for spinning c of cotton with intent to get such machines conveyed to the dominions of the emperor of Germany He also stands charged with another very serious offence the enticing a number of manufacturers in the cotton branch to go and settle in the emperor's dominions The vigilance and activity of ministry have traced out this most notorious offender and several others engaged with him in the same pernicious scheme big with destruction to this country The penalty for having manufacturing machines implements c in a person's custody with the bare intent of exporting them to any place out of his majesty's dominions is l and forfeiture of such manufacturing machines implements c and the penalty of persuading or attempting to persuade any artificer in manufactures to reside in any place out of the king's dominions is l for the first offence and twelve months' imprisonment and l and two years' imprisonment for every future offence  '  The licence which this determination affords has already begun to operate and perhaps in no instance more than in the article of watches For many years past this manufacture has flourished to such a degree that large fortunes have been acquired by it and that chiefly in our commerce with Spain in which country a watch fabricated in England has been deemed a present for a grandee and even for a sovereign prince It is well known that the late king of Spain was extremely fond of clocks and watches and that he was used by letters in his own handwriting to correspond with Mr Ellicot on the subject of his art and that this ingenious artificer  learnt the Spanish language to enable him to maintain the correspondence with his majesty Since that time the French and also the Genevans have become our rivals in this curious species of mechanism and we have lately experienced that English watches no longer find their vent abroad  'Twelve thousand watches have already been brought back in the ships arrived this summer from India which has created no small stir and combustion among the dealers in that article They were not returned for want of a good market but for their bad materials and worse finishing the natives being now become almost as good judges of this branch of British manufacture as many of our European makers'  St James's Chronicle th July  The woollen the silk the linen and the cotton manufactures have been obliged to the legislature for assistance against the endeavours of other European powers to establish them in their several countries where as labour is cheaper than it is with us they would have a good chance to flourish and exclude us from foreign markets  These mischiefs have followed from the restraint of a power which as it had oftener been exercised for the benefit of the trade and manufactures of this kingdom than to the hurt of individuals might well have been suffered to remain where it was especially as the ministers thereof were at all times responsible for any abuse of it  The probable consequence of this innovation will be that in a few years we shall see the French and neighbouring nations excel us as much in other manufactures as they already do in those of cambrick and paper in printing and other of the manual arts  The calamities which ensue from the stagnation of commerce are many and grievous and when these begin to be felt as they shortly may those good people of this country who have of late been so clamorous for liberty may recover their wits and be half persuaded that a sinking trade empty warehouses and unfurnished shops are greater evils than any loyal and peaceable subject need fear from the operation of a general warrant  The publication of Johnson's political tracts exhibited him to the world in a new character he ceased now to be considered as one who having been occupied in literary studies and more conversant with books than with men knew little of active life the views of parties or the artifices of designing men on the contrary they discovered that he had by the force of his own genius and the observations he had made on the history of our own and other countries attained to such skill in the grand leading principles of political science as are seldom acquired by those in the most active and important stations even after long experience and that whatever opinions he might have formed on this subject he had ability by strong reasoning to defend and by a manly and convincing eloquence to enforce  Mr Thrale a man of slow conceptions but of a sound judgment was not one of the last that discerned in his friend this talent and believing that the exercise of it might redound to the benefit of the public entertained a design of bringing Johnson into parliament We must suppose that he had previously determined to furnish him with a legal qualification and Johnson it is certain was willing to accept the  trust Mr Thrale had two meetings with the minister who at first seemed inclined to find him a seat but whether upon conversation he doubted his fitness for his purpose or that he thought himself in no need of his assistance the project failed  Had it succeeded and Johnson become a member of the house of commons as he was one of the most correct speakers ever known  This all who knew him can attest His written compositions were also so correct that he in general trusted them to the press without a revisal Rasselas he never red till it was printed and having written at Mr Langton's room at Oxford an Idler while the post was preparing to set out that gentleman would have perused it but Johnson would not suffer him saying  'You shall not do more than I have done myself'  he would undoubtedly have exhibited to that assembly a perfect model of senatorial eloquence and might probably have prevented the introduction therein of a great number of words phrases and forms of speech to which neither dictionaries nor the example of any English writer of authority have given a sanction  Such as these a truismreciprocityliving in habits of friendshipa shade of differencethat line of conductsentiments in unisonblinking the questionI am bold to sayI should then commit myselfand others equally affected and singular See the speeches in the public papers for the last seven years    Johnson was a little soured at this disappointment he spoke of lord North in terms of asperity as indeed he did of all those ministers whose councils indicated a want of spirit to carry into action the measures which were resolved on as expedient in which particular the above minister must surely  be exculpated whose designs it is too well known were blasted by those to whom the execution of them was committed Of the abilities of Mr Grenville he also entertained but a mean opinion for his giving up the Manila ransom  'Grenville' he would say if he 'could have got the Manila ransom was able to have counted the money but he knew not how to enforce the payment of it'  Of Sir Robert Walpole notwithstanding that he had written against him in the early part of his life he had a high opinion he said of him that he was a fine fellow and that his very enemies deemed him so before his death he honoured his memory for having kept this country in peace many years as also for the goodness and placability of his temper of which Pulteney earl of Bath thought so highly that in a conversation with Johnson he said that Sir Robert was of a temper so calm and equal and so hard to be provoked that he was very sure he never felt the bitterest invectives against him for half an hour  To this motive for honouring him he might have added others namely the pains he took to extend the commerce of this country Dean Tucker has enumerated the many statutes which he procured to be passed for this purpose and has both ascertained their number and demonstrated the benefits which for a series of years we have been deriving from them By the good understanding which he kept up with cardinal Fleury he drew the attention of that minister from the marine of France and the consequence thereof was that in our seaengagements with the French under Anson Warren Hawke and other commanders their fleets proved an easy conquest for which reason the memory of cardinal Fleury is execrated even to this day by the French who say he was cajoled by the English minister  To the same purpose Johnson related the following anecdote which he said he had  from lord North Sir Robert having got into his hands some treasonable letters of his inveterate enemy Will Shippen one of the heads of the Jacobite faction he sent for him and burned them before his face Some time afterwards Shippen had occasion to take the oaths to the government in the house of commons which while he was doing Sir Robert who stood next him and knew his principles to be the same as ever smiled  'Egad Robin' said Shippen who had observed him 'that's hardly fair'  It is not a little wonderful that Sir Robert Walpole could preserve such an equanimity under the greatest provocations as he is known to have done or that he could entertain a kindness for any one seeing he is known to have asserted that every man has his price to which I will add from unquestionable authority that some time before his death he uttered this sentiment  'that so great is the depravity of the human heart that ministers who only could know it were in charity to mankind bound to keep it a secret'  Agreeable to this of Dr Young  Heav'n's Sovereign saves all Beings but himself  That hideous sight a naked human heart  Night Thoughts Narcissa  In the year Johnson received from the university of Oxford the highest testimony of esteem which that learned body could confer in a diploma creating him a doctor in the faculty of law The instrument bears date the thirtieth day of March in the above year and recites the motives for this honourable distinction in  the following eulogium  'Sciatis virum illustrem Samuelem Johnson in omni humaniorum literarum genere eruditum omniumque scientiarum comprehensione felicissimum scriptis suis ad popularium mores formandos summâ verborum elegantiâ ac sententiarum gravitate compositis ita olim inclaruisse ut dignus videretur cui ab academiâ suâ eximia quaedam laudis praemia deferrentur quique in venerabilem magistrorum ordinem summâ cum dignitate cooptaretur Cum vero eundem clarissimum virum tot postea tantique labores in patriâ praesertim linguâ ornandâ et stabiliendâ feliciter impensi ita insigniverint ut in literarum republicâ princeps jam et primarius jure habeatur Nos Cancellarius c'  In the summer of the same year Johnson accepted of an invitation from his friend Mr Thrale to make one of a party with him and his wise in a tour to Paris No memoirs of this journey in his own handwriting are extant nor is the want thereof to be regretted unless it were certain that he was enough master of the French language to be able to converse in it  I have some reason to think that at his first coming to town and while he had lodgings in the Strand he frequented Slaughter's coffeehouse with a view to acquire a habit of speaking French but he never could attain to it Lockman used the same method and succeeded as Johnson himself once told me  and that he had noted down the reflections he may be supposed to have made in a visit to a strange country and a residence among a people whose national character differs from our own His garb and mode of dressing if it could be called dressing had long been so inflexibly determined as  to resist all the innovations of fashion His friends had therefore great difficulty in persuading him to such a compliance in this respect as might serve to keep them in countenance and secure him from the danger of ridicule he yielded to their remonstrances so far as to dress in a suit of black and a Bourgeois wig but resisted their importunity to wear ruffles  By a note in his diary it appears that he laid out near thirty pounds in cloaths for this journey    In the course of this narrative it has been shewn that although and that by his own declarations the literary faculties of Johnson were at most times inert and that he could seldom be stimulated to the exercise of his pen but by the immediate prospect of gain yet he was ever ready to assist the publication of any work that had either novelty or any intrinsic worth with a life of the author a dedication preface or an introduction tending to recommend it as in the case of  'Ascham's Pieces'  the last edition of Sir Thomas Browne's  'Christian Morals'  and Kennedy's  'Scripture Chronology'  and many more all of which he ushered into the world and for aught that appears without any recompence With a like benevolent disposition he was ready to assist with a prologue or an epilogue the representation of a play written by a friend or with an occasional address of the same kind under circumstances that put it in his power to promote the interests of the family of a deceased author accordingly he wrote for his friend Goldsmith a prologue to a comedy written by him called  'The Goodnatured man'  and acted in and for the granddaughter of Milton a prologue to Comus exhibited on the fifth day of April  The same good office he performed for the wife and children of Mr Hugh Kelly the author of a comedy called  'A Word to the Wise'  which in the year was brought on the stage but by the malice of a party was obstructed in the representation and consigned to oblivion This person it is said was originally a staymaker but being a man of wit and parts he quitted that unmanly occupation and having as we must suppose some slender means to enable him thereto he betook himself to reading and study and at a time when the discipline of the inns of court was scandalously lax got himself called to the bar and practised at the quartersessions under me but with little success In aid of this profession he became the conductor of a paper called  'The Public Ledger'  and took up that precarious one of a writer for the stage in which he met with some encouragement till it was insinuated that he was a pensioner of the minister and therefore a fit object of patriotic vengeance He died in the year and leaving a wife and five children unprovided for the proprietors of Coventgarden theatre in with their usual generosity permitted to be acted at their house for the benefit of his family the comedy abovementioned and to soften the hearts of the audience Johnson was easily prevailed on to write upon the occasion the following very fine lines  This night presents a play which public rage  Or right or wrong once hooted from the stage  From zeal or malice now no more we dread  For English vengeance  wars not with the dead  To the assertion contained in this line I here note an exception Whoever has viewed the monument of Camden in the south transept of Westminster abbey must till very lately have remarked that his bust thereon was defaced the nose having been stricken off This was no recent accident but a designed injury to his memory done to it by an exasperated young man who lived at the time of its erection The fact is related by Dr Thomas Smith in his life of Camden prefixed to his letters to and is to this effect Camden in his annals sub anno had related that a young lady whose name he suppressed but whom I conjecture to have been the daughter of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton and one of queen Elizabeth's maids of honour had been seduced by the arts of a young man of high rank to whom she was afterwards married and who became distinguished for his bravery and learning Sir Walter Raleigh as I suppose This fact though notorious in the court gave such offence to the young man abovementioned who was a relation of the lady as induced him to revenge himself on the author's memory by mutilating his effigy The injury done to it has however been lately repaired and the feature restored by the direction and at the expence of a friend to the memory of Camden    A generous foe regards with pitying eye  The man whom fate has laid where all must lie  To wit reviving from it's author's dust  Be kind ye judges or at least be just  Let no renew'd hostilities invade  Th' oblivious grave's inviolable shade  Let one great payment every claim appease  And him who cannot hurt allow to please  To please by scenes unconscious of offence  By harmless merriment or useful sense  Where aught of bright or fair the piece displays  Approve it only'tis too late to praise  If want of skill or want of care appear  Forbear to hissthe poet cannot hear  By all like him must praise and blame be found  At last a fleeting gleam or empty sound  Yet then shall calm reflection bless the night  When liberal pity dignified delight  When pleasure fired her torch at virtue's flame  And mirth was bounty with an humbler name  In the year he was induced by a case of a very extraordinary nature to the exercise of that indiscriminate humanity which in him was obedient to every call A divine of the church of England Dr William Dodd already mentioned in the course of this account and who had assisted in the education of the present earl of Chesterfield having by his extravagance involved himself in difficulties had recourse to the following among many other expedients to raise money As a pretended agent for this nobleman and in consideration of the sum of l he forged the hand of the earl to the grant of an annuity chargeable on his estate which forgery being detected Dodd was convicted of felony and sentenced to the usual punishment for such offences The public were at first very little interested in the fate of a man who besides the arts he had practised to make himself conspicuous as a man of letters had rendered himself scandalous by an offer to the first lawofficer in the kingdom of a large sum of money for a presentation to a valuable rectory but by various artifices and particularly the insertion of his name in the public papers with such palliatives as he and his friends could invent never without the epithet of  unfortunate  they were betrayed into such an enthusiastic commiseration of his  case as would have led a stranger to believe that himself had been no accessary to his distresses but that they were the inflictions of Providence  Great endeavours were used with the earl to prevail on him to desist from a prosecution but without effect His lordship preferred a bill of indictment for felony and the same being found before me at Hicks's Hall upon the evidence of himself and other witnesses Dodd was at the Old Bailey arraigned thereon and convicted  The evidence on the trial was so very full and clear that the jury hesitated not in the least to pronounce him guilty of the indictment and no circumstances of alleviation appearing they did not as juries seldom fail to do where that is the case recommend him as an object of that clemency which his majesty is ever ready to exert in favour of those who have the least claim to it  We live in an age in which humanity is the fashion If the reports of the gaolcommittee in are in all particulars to be depended on and do not exaggerate the facts therein stated there was a time when as well prisoners for debt as for offences were cruelly treated by those who had the custody of them but at this day the temper of the times is under a contrary biass for not only in actual confinement are prisoners treated with greater lenity than till of late years was ever known but in courts of justice the regard shewn to offenders falls little short of respect In prosecutions at the suit of the crown the indulgence of prisoners is nearly as great as it ought to be were that true which the law does but hardly presume viz that every offender who is brought to a legal trial  is innocent till his guilt be proved Those whose duty it is to conduct the evidence fearing the censure that others have incurred by a contrary treatment of prisoners are restrained from enforcing it and as it is an exercise of compassion that costs nothing and is sure to gain the applause of vulgar hearers every one interests himself on the side of the prisoner and hopes by his zeal in his behalf to be distinguished as a man of more than ordinary humanity  The tenderness of our courts of justice in prosecutions that affect the life or liberty of the offender is acknowledged and celebrated by all writers on the subjects of jurisprudence and internal policy but beside this the chances of eluding conviction or if not that of punishment are so many that they deter many injured persons from the prosecution of great criminals and as it is a speculation that has often employed my thoughts I will endeavour at an enumeration of them The chances are these That the offender is not discovered or if discovered not apprehended That the person injured is not both able and willing to prosecute him That the evidence is not sufficient for the finding of the bill or if it be That the indictment is so framed as that the offender cannot be convicted on it or That the witnesses to support it may die or be prevailed upon to abscond or to soften their testimony or They may be entangled or made to contradict themselves or each other in a cross examination by the prisoner's council or A mild judge or An ignorant or perverse jury A recommendation to mercy or Appeals to the public by states of his case in pamphlets or newspaper paragraphs  which the Newgate solicitors know very well how to get drawn Practices with a jury to obtain a declaration that some of them were dissatisfied with the verdict A motion in arrest of judgment A writ of error grounded on some defect or mistake on the face of the record An escape and lastly Interest to procure a pardon  To this purpose and as a caveat against seeking redress for injuries by going to law I recollect a saying of a very sagacious and experienced citizen Mr Selwin who formerly was a candidate for the office of chamberlain and missed it only by seven votes out of near seven thousand  'A man' says he 'who deliberates about going to law should have first a good cause secondly a good purse thirdly an honest and skilful attorney fourthly good evidence fifthly able council sixthly an upright judge seventhly an intelligent jury and with all these on his side if he has not eighthly good luck it is odds but he miscarries in his suit'  The same person told me the following story He was once requested by a man under sentence of death in Newgate to come and see him in his cell and in pure humanity he made him a visit The man briefly informed him that he had been tried and convicted of felony and was in daily expectation of the arrival of the warrant for his execution  'but' said he 'I have l and you are a man of character and had the courtinterest when you stood for chamberlain I should therefore hope it is in your power to get me off'  Mr Selwin was struck with so strange an application and to account for it asked if there were any alleviating circumstances in his case the man peevishly answeredNobut that he had enquired into the history of the place where he was and could not find that any one who had two hundred pounds was ever hangedMr Selwin told him it was out of his power to help him and bade him farewell  'which' added he 'he did for he found means to escape punishment'  The disposition of the law and of magistrates to be merciful to offenders against it leads me to remark that in the people of this country there is a general propensity to humanity and that notwithstanding the cry against merciless creditors urged in favour of insolvent acts such a character is hardly now to be found I have in my time discharged great numbers of debtors under such acts and cannot recollect five instances where their discharge has been opposed And with regard to bankrupts and other insolvents I am warranted by long experience and much observation to say that in cases where their inability to pay their debts has arisen from misfortune the readiness of creditors to accept a small composition and give them fresh credit has been such as I could not contemplate without calling to remembrance the parable in the Gospel of the lord that was moved with compassion and forgave his debtor And with respect to injuries such as personal assaults or indignities an Englishman never seeks farther than to humble his adversary when that is done forgiveness and shaking hands follow of course If therefore it be true that humanity is the offspring of courage we have not far to seek for the source of British bravery    But Dodd's case was such as excluded him from the benefit of all the above chances excepting the last and of that he laboured with all his might to avail himself A petition to the throne for a pardon was an expedient that naturally suggested itself but as it required the utmost powers of eloquence to palliate his offence he found means to interest Dr Johnson in his behalf and easily procured from him two of the most energetic compositions of the kind ever seen the one a petition from himself to the king the other a like address from his wife to the queen severally conceived in the terms following  To the King's most excellent Majesty  SIR  It is most humbly represented to your majesty by William Dodd the unhappy convict now lying under sentence of death  That William Dodd acknowledging the justice of the sentence denounced against him has no hope or refuge but in your majesty's clemency  That though to recollect or mention the usefulness of his life or the efficacy of his ministry must overwhelm him in his present condition with shame and sorrow he yet humbly hopes that his past labours will not wholly be forgotten and that the zeal with which he has exhorted others to a good life though it does not extenuate his crime may mitigate his punishment  That debased as he is by ignominy and distressed as he is by poverty scorned by the world and detested by himself deprived of all external comforts and afflicted by consciousness of guilt he can derive no hopes of longer life but that of repairing the injury he has done to mankind by exhibiting an example of shame and submission and of expiating his sins by prayer and penitence  That for this end he humbly implores from the clemency of your majesty the continuance of a life legally forfeited and of the days which by your gracious compassion he may yet live no one shall pass without a prayer that your majesty after a long life of happiness and honour may stand at the day of final judgment among the merciful that obtain mercy  So fervently prays the most distressed and wretched of your majesty's subjects  WILLIAM DODD  To the Queen's most excellent Majesty  MADAM  It is most humbly represented by Mary Dodd wife of Dr William Dodd now lying in prison under sentence of death  That she has been the wife of this unhappy man more than twentyseven years and has lived with him in the greatest happiness of conjugal union and the highest state of conjugal confidence  That she has been a constant witness of his unwearied endeavours for public good and his laborious attendance on charitable institutions Many are the families whom his care has delivered from want many are the hearts which he has freed from pain and the faces which he has cleared from sorrow  That therefore she most humbly throws herself at the feet of the queen earnestly intreating that the petition of distressed wife asking mercy for a husband may be considered as naturally soliciting the compassion of her majesty and that when her wisdom has compared the offender's good actions with his crime she will be pleased to represent his case to our most gracious sovereign in such terms as may dispose him to mitigate the rigour of the law  So prays your majesty's most dutiful subject and supplicant  MARY DODD  To the first of these petitions but not without difficulty Mrs Dodd first got the hands of the jury that found the bill against her husband and after that as it is supposed of the jury that tried him It was then circulated about and all the while the cry for mercy was kept up in the newspapers and the merits and sufferings of the unfortunate divine were so artfully represented by paragraphs therein inserted that in a short space of time no fewer than twentythree thousand names were subscribed thereto Moreover letters and addresses written also by Johnson imploring their interposition were sent to the minister and other great persons  While the two petitions were in suspence the following observations penned by Dr Johnson appeared in the public papers  'Yesterday was presented to the secretary of state by earl Percy a petition in favour of Dr Dodd signed by twentythree thousand hands On this occasion it is natural to consider  'That in all countries penal laws have been relaxed as particular reasons have emerged  'That a life eminently beneficent a single action eminently good or even the power of being useful to the public have been sufficient to protect the life of a delinquent  'That no arbiter of life and death has ever been censured for granting the life of a criminal to honest and powerful solicitation  'That the man for whom a nation petitions must be presumed to have merit uncommon in kind or in degree for however the mode of collecting  subscriptions or the right of judgment exercised by the subscribers may be open to dispute it is at least plain that something is done for this man that was never done for any other and government which must proceed upon general views may rationally conclude that this man is something better than other offenders have been or has done something more than others have done  'That though the people cannot judge of the administration of justice so well as their governors yet their voice has always been regarded  'That this is a case in which the petitioners determine against their own interest those for whose protection the law was made intreat its relaxation and our governors cannot be charged with the consequences which the people bring upon themselves  'That as this is a case without example it will probably be without consequences and many ages will elapse before such a crime is again committed by such a man  'That though life be spared justice may be satisfied with ruin imprisonment exile infamy and penury  'That if the people now commit an error their error is on the part of mercy and that perhaps history cannot shew a time in which the life of a criminal guilty of nothing above fraud was refused to the cry of nations to the joint supplication of three and twenty thousand petitioners'  While Dodd was waiting the event of the petitions his wife and friends were not idle Dr Johnson told  me that they had offered Akerman the keeper of Newgate a thousand pounds to let him escape and that failing that a number of them with banknotes in their pockets to the amount of five hundred pounds had watched for a whole evening about the door of the prison for an opportunity of corrupting the turnkey but could not succeed in the attempt  When all hopes of a favourable answer to either of the petitions were at an end Johnson drew up for publication a small collection of what are called  'Occasional papers by the late William Dodd LLD'  and five hundred copies thereof were printed for the benefit of his wife but she conscious that they were not of her husband's writing would not consent to their being published and the whole number except two or three copies was suppressed The last office he performed for this wretched man was the composing a sermon which he delivered in the chapel of Newgate on Friday th June and which was soon after published with the title of  'The Convict's Address'  Johnson had never seen the face of Dodd in his life His wife had found her way to him during his confinement and had interested him so strongly in his behalf that he lamented his fate as he would have done that of an intimate friend under the like circumstances He was deeply concerned at the failure of the petitions and asked me at the time if the request contained in them was not such an one as ought to have been granted to the prayer of twentythree thousand subjects to which I answered that the subscription of popular petitions was a thing of  course and that therefore the difference between twenty and twenty thousand names was inconsiderable He further censured the clergy very severely for not interposing in his behalf and said that their inactivity arose from a paltry fear of being reproached with partiality towards one of their own order  Here I cannot forbear remarking an inconsistency in the opinion of Johnson respecting the case of Dodd He assisted in the solicitations for his pardon yet in his private judgment he thought him unworthy of it having been known to say that had he been the adviser of the king he should have told him that in pardoning Dodd his justice in remitting the Perreaus to their sentence would have been called in question  About this time Dr Johnson changed his dwelling in Johnson's court for a somewhat larger in Bolt court Fleet street where he commenced an intimacy with the landlord of it a very worthy and sensible man some time since deceased Mr Edmund Allen the printer Behind it was a garden which he took delight in watering a room on the groundfloor was assigned to Mrs Williams and the whole of the two pair of stairs floor was made a repository for his books one of the rooms thereon being his study Here in the intervals of his residence at Streatham he received the visits of his friends and to the most intimate of them sometimes gave not inelegant dinners  Being at ease in his circumstances and free from that solicitude which had embittered the former part of his life he sunk into indolence till his faculties feemed to be impaired deafness grew upon him long intervals of mental absence interrupted his conversation  and it was difficult to engage his attention to any subject His friends from these symptoms concluded that his lamp was emitting its last rays but the lapse of a short period gave them ample proofs to the contrary  In the year the longagitated question of literary property received a final decision on an appeal to the supreme judicature of this kingdom whereby it was in effect declared that such property was merely ideal and existed only in imagination  In the arguments in this case on a special verdict in the court of King'sbench it was admitted that precedents directly to the point were wanting it was therefore determined by lord Mansfield and two other judges Yates alone dissenting upon the simple principles of natural justice and moral fitness that the right contended for did exist and that these are part of the law of England is asserted and has ever been understood Vide Dodderidge's  'English Lawyer'  page to and  'Doctor and Student'  passim Nevertheless in the argument of an appeal to the lords from a decree of the court of Chancery in it was contended that in new cases the judges had no right to decide by the rules of moral fitness and equitable right but were to be ruled by precedents alone An objection the more remarkable as coming from men who are known to despise the study of antiquity to have ridiculed the perusal of records and to have treated with the utmost scorn what they are pleased to term blackletter learning If this be law and every judicial determination needs a precedent we are left at a loss to account for those carly and original determinations for which no precedent could be found but which are now become fundamental principles of law such for instance as that a bare right of action is not assignable that of things fixed to the freehold felony cannot be committed that a release to one trespasser is a release to all and numberless others Lord Hardwicke has been known to direct a search for precedents and when none could be found to say  'I will make one'  The immediate consequence of this determination  was a scramble of the lowest and least principled of the booksellers for the jewel thus cast among them Regardless of that obvious rule of natural justice which gives the possessor a right to what he has purchased they printed books for the copyright whereof very large sums had been paid by booksellers who for their liberality to authors and the encouragement by them given to voluminous works had been looked on and acknowledged as the patrons of literature Among these numerous depredators was one who projected an edition of the English poets which by advertisements conceived in the most hyperbolical terms and calculated to impose upon the credulity of the ignorant was obtruded on the public  The booksellers against whose interest this intended publication was likely to operate derived their right to the works of many of the poets included in the above design by mesne assignments from those ever respectable men the Tonsons who had purchased them of their authors To check this attempt therefore they determined themselves to publish an edition of the poets and in order to obtain for it a preference engaged Johnson to write the lives of all or the chief of them and he undertook and executed the task with great alacrity and in a manner that argued not the least decline of his faculties  When Johnson had determined on this work he was to seek for the best mode of executing it On a hint from a literary lady of his acquaintance and mine he adopted for his outline that form in which the countess D'Aunois has drawn up the memoirs of the  French poets in her  'Recueils des plus belles pieces des Poëtes François'  and the foundation of his work was the lives of the dramatic poets by Langbaine and the lives of the poets at large by Winstanley and that more modern one than either their lives by Giles Jacob whose information in many instances was communicated by the persons themselves Nevertheless the materials which Johnson had to work on were very scanty He was never a sedulous enquirer after facts or anecdotes nor very accurate in fixing dates Oldys was the man of all others the best qualified for such an employment Johnson's talent was disquisition a genius like his disdained so servile a labour Whenever therefore he found himself at a loss for such intelligence as his work required he availed himself of the industry of a friend or two who took pleasure in furnishing him with such particulars as are to be found in the lives of Addison Prior Pope Swift Gay and a few others whose persons habits and characters some yet or very lately living were able either from their own knowledge or authenticated tradition to describe  The book came abroad in the year in ten small volumes and no work of Johnson has been more celebrated It has been said to contain the soundest principles of criticism and the most judicious examen of the effusions of poetic genius that any country not excepting France has to shew and so much of this is true that in our perusal of it we find our curiosity as to facts and circumstances absorbed in the contemplation of those penetrating reflections and nice discriminations which are far the greater part of it  It is nevertheless to be questioned whether Johnson possessed all the qualities of a critic one of which seems to be a truly poetic faculty This may seem a strange doubt of one who has transfused the spirit of one of Mr Pope's finest poems into one written by himself in a dead language and in two instances nearly equalled the greatest of the Roman satyrists By the poetic faculty I mean that power which is the result of a mind stored with beautiful images and which exerts itself in creation and description of this Johnson was totally devoid His organs imperfect as they were could convey to his imagination but little of that intelligence which forms the poetic character and produces that enthusiasm which distinguishes it If we try his ability by Shakespeare's famous description  The poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling  Doth glance from Heaven to earth from earth to Heaven  And as imagination bodies forth  The forms of things unknown the poet's pen  Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing  A local habitation and a name  he will appear deficient We know that he wanted this power that he had no eye that could be said to  oll or glance and therefore that all his conceptions of the grandeur and magnificence of external objects of beautiful scenes and extensive prospects were derived from the reports of others and consequently were but the feeble impressions of their archetypes  so that it may be questioned whether either waking or sleeping  Such sights as youthful poets dream  were ever presented to his view  This defect in his imaginative faculty may well account for the frigid commendation which Johnson bestows on Thomson and other of the descriptive poets on many fine passages in Dryden and on the Henry and Emma of Prior Moral sentiments and versification seem chiefly to have engaged his attention and on these his criticisms are accurate but severe and not always impartial His avowed fondness for rhyme is one of the blemishes in his judgment he entertained it in opposition to Milton and cherished it through the whole of his life and it led him into many errors Dryden had his doubts about the preference of rhyme to blank verse and I have heard Johnson accuse him for want of principle in this respect and of veering about in his opinion on the subject No such imputation could fasten on himself  That Johnson had no sense of the harmony of musical sounds himself would frequently confess but this defect lest him not without the power of deriving pleasure from metrical harmony from that commixture of long and short quantities which the laws of prosody have reduced to rule and from whence arises a delight in those whose ear is unaffected by consonance The strokes on the pulsatile instruments the drum for instance though they produce monotonous sounds have if made by rule mathematical ratios of duple and triple with numberless fractions  and admit of an infinite variety of combinations which give pleasure to the auditory faculty but of this Johnson seems also to have been insensible That his own numbers are so harmonious as in general we find them must have been the effect of his sedulous attention to the writings of Dryden and Pope and the discovery of some secret in their versification of which he was able to avail himself  If Johnson be to be numbered among those poets in whom the powers of understanding more than those of the imagination are seen to exist we have a reason for that coldness and insensibility which he so often discovers in the course of this work and when we recollect that he professed himself to be a fastidious critic we are not to wonder that he is sometimes backward in bestowing applause on passages that seem to merit it In short he was a scrupulous estimator of beauties and blemishes and possessed a spirit of criticism which by long exercise may be said to have become mechanical So nicely has he balanced the one against the other that in some instances he has made neither scale preponderate and in others by considering the failings of his authors as positive demerit he has left some celebrated names in a state of reputation below mediocrity A spirit like this had before actuated him in his preface to Shakespeare in which by a kind of arithmetical process subtracting from his excellencies his failings he has endeavoured to sink him in the opinion of his numerous admirers and to persuade us against reason and our own feelings that the former are annihilated by the latter  His censures of the writings of lord Lyttelton and of Gray gave great offence to the friends of each the first cost him the friendship of a lady whose remarks on the genius of Shakespeare have raised her to a degree of eminence among the female writers of this time and the supposed injury done by him to the memory of Gray is resented by the whole university of Cambridge The character of Swift he has stigmatized with the brand of pride and selfishness so deeply impressed that the marks thereof seem indelible In the praises of his wit he does him no more than justice of his moral qualities he has made the most and of his learning of which Swift possessed but a very small portion he has said nothing Few can be offended at Johnson's account of this man whose arrogance and malevolence were a reproach to human nature and in whose voluminous writings little is to be found that can conduce to the improvement or benefit of mankind or indeed that it beseemed a clergyman to publish  In his own judgment of the lives of the poets Johnson gave the preference to that of Cowley as containing a nicer investigation and discrimination of the characteristics of wit than is elsewhere to be found Others have assigned to Dryden's life the preeminence Upon the whole it is a finely written and an entertaining book and is likely to be coeval with the memory of the best of the writers whom it celebrates  To the life of Pope he thought proper to adjoin a criticism on the epitaphs of that poet written some years before and inserted in a monthly pamphlet intitled  'The Visitor'  in which he detects a great  number of faulty passages and puerile sentiments An attempt of the like kind had formerly been made by Concanen one of the Dunciad heroes in a paper called  'The Speculatist'  first published in one of the periodical papers of the day and afterwards collected into an octavo volume but it went no farther than to a censure of the inscription on Craggs's monument in Westminster abbey which by the way was never intended for an epitaph but is an eulogium on that statesman taken from Pope's  'Epistle to Mr Addison occasioned by his dialogues on medals'  Johnson has noticed this and apologizing for some faults in it imputes them in his strong manner of expression to the violence with which the lines were torn from the original The whole of Concanen's criticism turns upon the length of the inscription which is six lines and by a strange blunder of Pope is recommended as a motto for the supposed medal to be struck in commemoration of his services and gives occasion to the critic to ask  'Is this a motto for a medal or a millstone'  But Johnson who never examined the writings of any author but with an eye the most penetrating has taken a nearer view of these compositions of Pope as they appear in his works and discovered that scarce any one of them notwithstanding the beauty of versification which they display will bear the test of sound criticism For his remarks on them this is no fit place the inquisitive reader is therefore referred for the perusal of them to the life of Pope among the poets and for farther information on the subject of monumental inscriptions to  'An Essay on Epitaphs'  among his philological tracts  All that is necessary to remark on his examen of Pope's epitaphs is that in one instance it was productive of a singular event the total erasure of that epitaph on Sir Godfrey Kneller's monument in Westminster abbey which had long been objected to as being a very indifferent imitation of cardinal Bembo's famous distich on Raphael and it seems that the author thought so for in the later editions of his works he has omitted it  Ille hic est Raphaël timuit quo sospite vinci  Rerum magna parens moriente mori  After he had finished the lives of the poets Johnson contemplating the strength of his mental powers was so little sensible of any decay in them that he entertained a design of giving to the world a translation of that voluminous work of Thuanus the history of his own times an undertaking surely too laborious for one who had nearly completed the age of man and whose mind was generally occupied by subjects of greater importance than any that relate to this world But in this estimate of his abilities he soon found himself deceived Sleepless nights and the use of opium which he took in large quantities alternately depressed and raised his spirits and rendered him an incompetent judge of his own powers so that had he pursued his resolution he would doubtless have sunk under the burden of so great a labour  It may farther be questioned whether upon trial he would not have found himself unequal to the task of transfusing into an English version the spirit  of his author Johnson's talent was original thinking and though he was ever able to express his own sentiments in nervous language he did not always succeed in his attempts to familiarise the sense of others his translation of Pere Lobo's voyage has little to recommend it but the subjectmatter Among his papers was found a translation from Sallust of the  'Bellum Catilinarium'  so flatly and insipidly rendered that the suffering it to appear would have been an indeligible disgrace to his memory  We must now take our leave of Johnson as an author and view him as a man worn out with literary labour and disease contemplating his dissolution and exerting all his powers to resist that constitutional malady which now more than ever oppressed him To divert himself from a train of thinking which often involved him in a labyrinth of doubts and difficulties touching a future state of existence he solicited the frequent visits of his friends and acquaintance the most discerning of whom could not but see that the fabric of his mind was tottering and to allay those scruples and terrors which haunted him in his vacant hours he betook himself to the reading of books of practical divinity and among the rest the writings of Baxter and others of the old puritan and nonconforming divines Of Baxter he entertained a very high opinion and often spoke of him to me as a man of great parts profound learning and exemplary piety he said of the office for the communion drawn up by him and produced at the Savoyconference that it was one of the finest compositions of the ritual kind he had ever seen  It is printed at the end of the first volume of Dr Calamy's abridgement of Mr Baxter's History of his Life and Times    It was a circumstance to be wondered at that a highchurchman as Johnson ever professed himself to be should be driven to seek for spiritual comfort in the writings of sectaries men whom he affected as well to condemn for their ignorance as to hate for their principles but as his acquaintance with the world and with the writings of such men as Watts Foster Lardner and Lowman increased these prejudices were greatly softened Of the early puritans he thought their want of general learning was atoned for by their skill in the Scriptures and the holiness of their lives  Yet have there been among them a few as eminent for their learning as their piety and in justice to their memory I will mention two of this character the one was Gataker well known for his excellent edition of the Meditations of the emperor Marcus Antoninus and his Commentary on the prophecy of Jeremiah the other a somewhat earlier writer old Mr Dod surnamed the Decalogist an exquisite Hebrew scholar a man of primitive sanctity and a passive nonconforming divine His memory is not quite extinct among the dissenters of the present age for I remember in my youth to have seen in the window of an old bookseller of that denomination a printed broad sheet with a wooden portrait at the top thereof intitled  'Mr Dod's sayings'  being a string of religious aphorisms intended to be stuck up in the houses of poor persons In Fuller's Worthics page and also in his Churchhistory book xi page are some particulars that mark his character and in the latter page the following note of his simplicity  'He was but coarsely used by the cavaliers and when the soldiers who came to plunder him brought down the sheets out of his chamber into the room where he sat by the fireside he in their absence to search for more took one pair and clapped them under his cushion whereon he sat much pleasing himself after their departure that he had as he said plundered the plunderers and by a lawful felony had saved so much of his own to himself He died the same year with archbishop Laud and with him' this author adds 'the old puritan seemed to expire'  and to justify his opinion of them  and their writings he once cited to me a saying of Howell in one of his letters that to make a man a complete Christian he must have the works of a Papist the words of a Puritan and the faith of a Protestant  Howell's Letters book ii letter II The author must here be understood to mean protestants of the established church for the puritans are also protestants This dictum carries the more weight with it as it comes from a man whose sentiments respecting sectaries may be inferred from the following passage in another of his letters  'If I hate any it is those schismatics that puzzle the sweet peace of the church so that I could be content to see an Anabaptist go to Hell on a Brownist's back'  Book i letter  At times when he was most distressed I recommended to him the perusal of bishop Taylor's  'Rules and Exercises of holy Living and Dying'  and also his  'Ductor Dubitantium'  a book abounding in erudition and most aptly suiting his circumstances Of the former though he placed the author at the head of all the divines that have succeeded the fathers he said that in the reading thereof he had found little more than he brought himself and at the mention of the latter he seemed to shrink His Greek testament was generally within his reach and he red much in it He was competently skilled in the writings of the fathers yet was he more conversant with those of the great English churchmen namely Hooker Usher Mede Hammond Sanderson Hall and others of that class Dr Henry More of Cambridge he did not much affect he was a platonist and in Johnson's opinion a visionary He would frequently cite from him and laugh at a passage to this effect  'At the consummation of all things it shall come to pass that eternity shall shake hands with opacity'  He had never till I mentioned  him heard of Dr Thomas Jackson of Corpus Christi college Oxon Upon my recommendation of his works in three folio volumes he made me a promise to buy and study them which he lived not to perform He was for some time pleased with Kempis's or rather John Gerson's tract  'De Imitatione Christi'  but at length laid it aside saying that the main design of it was to promote monastic piety and inculcate ecclesiastical obedience One sentiment therein he however greatly applauded and I find it adopted by bishop Taylor who gives it in the following words  'It is no great matter to live lovingly with goodnatured with humble and meek persons but he that can do so with the froward with the wilful and the ignorant with the peevish and perverse he only hath true charity Always remembering that our true solid peace the peace of God consists rather in compliance with others than in being complied with in suffering and forbearing rather than in contention and victory  Polemical and moral discourses folio page  '  In the course of these studies he exercised his powers of eloquence in the composition of forms of devotion adapted to his circumstances and the state of his mind at different times Of these a specimen has lately been given to the public He also translated into Latin many of the collects in our liturgy This was a practice which he took up in his early years and continued through his life as he did also the noting down the particular occurrences of each day thereof but in a loose and desultory way  in books of various forms and in no regular or continued succession  He seemed to acquiesce in that famous saying of John Valdesso which induced the emperor Charles the fifth to resign his crown and betake himself to religious retirement  'Oportet inter vitae negotia et diem mortis spatium aliquod intercedere  It is fit that between the business of life and the day of death some space should intervene  '  nevertheless he was but an ill husband of his time He was throughout his life making resolutions to rise at eight no very early hour and breaking them The visits of idle and some of them very worthless persons were never unwelcome to him and though they interrupted him in his studies and meditations yet as they gave him opportunities of discourse and furnished him with intelligence he strove rather to protract that shorten or discountenance them and when abroad such was the laxity of his mind that he consented to the doing of many things otherwise indifferent for the avowed reason that they would drive on time  Of his visitors at this time myself was one and having known the state of his mind at different periods and his habitual dread of insanity I was greatly desirous of calming his mind and rendering him susceptible of the many enjoyments of which I thought him then in possession namely a permanent income tolerable health a high degree of reputation for his moral qualities and literary exertions by which latter he had made a whole country sensible of its obligation to him and lastly that he had as  few enemies as a man of his eminence could expect On one day in particular when I was suggesting to him these and the like reflections he gave thanks to Almighty God but added that notwithstanding all the above benefits the prospect of death which was now at no great distance from him was become terrible and that he could not think of it but with great pain and trouble of mind  I was very much surprised and shocked at such a declaration from such a man and told him that from my long acquaintance with him I conceived his life to have been an uniform course of virtue that he had ever shewn a deep sense of and zeal for religion and that both by his example and his writings he had recommended the practice of it that he had not rested as many do in the exercise of common honesty avoiding the grosser enormities yet rejecting those advantages that result from the belief of divine revelation but that he had by prayer and other exercises of devotion cultivated in his mind the seeds of goodness and was become habitually pious These suggestions made little impression on him he lamented the indolence in which he had spent his life talked of secret transgressions and seemed desirous of telling me more to that purpose than I was willing to hear  From these perturbations of mind he had however at times relief Upon a visit that I made him some months after I found him much altered in his sentiments He said that having reflected on the transactions of his life and acknowledged his sins before God he felt within himself a confidence in his  mercy and that trusting to the merits of his Redeemer his mind was now in a state of perfect tranquillity  In these discourses he would frequently mention with great energy and encomiums the penitence of the man who assumed the name and by that I must call him of George Psalmanaazar a Frenchman but who pretended to be a native of the island of Formosa and a convert from paganism to Christianity and as such received baptism By the help of his great learning and endowments he eluded all attempts to detect his impostures but in his more advanced age became a sincere penitent and without any other motive than a sense of his sin published a confession of them and begged the pardon of mankind in terms the most humble and affecting The remainder of his life was exemplary and he died in The habitation of this person was in Ironmonger row Old street Middlesex in the neighbourhood whereof he was so well known and esteemed that as Dr Hawkesworth once told me scarce any person eve  children passed him without shewing him the usua  signs of respect He was one of the writers of th  UniversalHistory and by his intercourse with th  booksellers it was as I conceive that Johnson becam  acquainted with him  For a more particular account of this extraordinary man  'the new and general Biographical Dictionary'  in twelve volume  vo in articulo    I mention the above particulars as well to corrobo+rate those testimonies of Johnson's piety already extan  as to refute the objections of many infidels who de+sirous of having him thought to be of their party  endeavoured to make it believed that he was a mere moralist and that when writing on religious subjects he accommodated himself to the notions of the vulgar and also because a certain female sceptic of his acquaintance was once heard to say that she was sure Dr Johnson was too great a philosopher to be a believer  From this digression which I mean as an introduction to certain particulars of his behaviour in his last illness hereafter related I proceed to the future events of his life In the year death put an end to the friendship that for some years had subsisted between him and Mr Thrale but gave birth to a relation that seemed to be but a continuation of it viz that of an executor the duties of which office involved in it the management of an immense trade the disposal of a large fortune and the interests of children rising to maturity For the trouble it might create him Mr Thrale bequeathed to him as he did to each of his other executors a legacy of two hundred pounds  Dr Johnson was not enough a man of the world to be capable alone of so important a trust Indeed it required for the execution of it somewhat like a board a kind of standing council adapted by the several qualifications of the individuals that composed it to all emergencies Mr Thrale wisely foresaw this and associated with Johnson three other persons men of great experience in business and of approved worth and integrity It was easy to see as Johnson was unskilled in both money and commercial transactions that Mr Thrale's view in constituting him one of his executors could only be that by his philosophical  prudence and sagacity of which himself had in some instances found the benefit  A few years before Mr Thrale's death an emulation arose among the brewers to exceed each other in the magnitude of their vessels for keeping beer to a certain age probably taking the hint from the great tun at Heidelburg One of that trade I think it was Mr Whitbread had made one that would hold some thousand barrels the thought whereof troubled Mr Thrale and made him repeat from Plutarch a saying of Themistocles  'The trophies of Miltiades hinder my sleeping'  Johnson by sober reasoning quieted him and prevented his expending a large sum on what could be productive of no real benefit to him or his trade  he might give a general direction to the motions of so vast a machine as they had to conduct Perhaps he might also think that the celebrity of Johnson's character would give a lustre to that constellation in which he had thought proper to place him This may be called vanity but it seems to be of the same kind with that which induced Mr Pope to appoint Mr Murray now earl of Mansfield one of the executors of his will  No sooner had this trust devolved on him than he applied to me for advice He had never been an executor before and was at a loss in the steps to be taken I told him the first was proving the will a term that he understood not I explained it to him as also the oath that would be tendered to him faithfully to execute it to administer the testator's effects according to law and to render a true account thereof when required I told him that in this act he would be joined by the other executors whom as they were all men of business he would do well to follow  Johnson had all his life long been used to lead to direct and instruct and did not much relish the thoughts of following men who in all the situations he could conceive would have looked up to him he therefore as he afterwards confessed to me began to form theories and visionary projects adapted as well to the continuation and extension of the trade which be it remembered was brewing as the disposal of it but in this as he also acknowledged he found himself at a loss The other executors after reflecting on the difficulty of conducting so large an undertaking the disagreeableness of an office that would render them in effect taxgatherers as all of that trade are and place them in a situation between the public and the revenue determined to make sale of the whole and blew up Johnson's schemes for their commencing brewers into the air In the carrying this resolution into act the executors had a great difficulty to encounter Mr Thrale's trade had been improving for two generations and was become of such an enormous magnitude as nothing but an aggregate of several fortunes was equal to a circumstance which could not but affect the intrinsic value of the object and increase the difficulty of finding purchasers of things indivisible exposed to sale an estimate may be formed till their value rises to a certain amount but after that a considerable abatement from their intrinsic worth must be made to meet the circumstance of a paucity of purchasers This was the case in the sale of Pitt's diamond which in the ratio by which jewels are valued was computed to be worth l but because  only a very few persons were able to purchase it was sold to the last king of France for little more than l  This difficulty great as it was Mr Thrale's executors found the way to surmount they commenced a negociation with some persons of worth and character which being conducted on both sides with fairness and candour terminated in a conveyance of the trade with all its appendages for which the consideration was an hundred and thirtyfive thousand pounds Of this arduous transaction Johnson was little more than a spectator and when called upon to ratify it he readily acquiesced There only remained for him to do justice to the memory of him whom he could not but consider as both his friend and benefactor and this he did by an exercise of his talent in the following monumental inscription  Hic conditur quod reliquum est  HENRICI THRALE  Qui res seu civiles seu domesticas ita egit  Ut vitam illi longiorem multi optarent  Ita sacras  Ut quam brevem esset habiturus prescire videretur  Simplex apertus sibique semper similis  Nihil ostentavit aut arte fictum aut cura  Elaboratum  In senatu regi patriaeque  Fideliter studuit  Vulgi obstrepentis contemptor animosus  Domi inter mille mercaturae negotia  Literarum elegantiam minimè neglexit  Amicis quocunque modo laborantibus  Conciliis auctoritate muneribus adfuit  Inter familiares comites convivas hospites  Tam facili fuit morum suavitate  Ut omnium animos ad se alliceret  Tam felici sermonis libertate  Ut nulli adulatus omnibus placeret  Natus Ob  Consortes tumuli habet Rodolphum patrem  Strenuum fortemque virum et Henricum  Filium unicum quem spei parentum  Mors inopina decennem  Praeripuit  Ita  Domus felix et opulenta quam erexit  Avus auxitque pater cum nepote decidit  Abi viator  Et vicibus rerum humanarum perspectis  Eternitatem cogita  The death of Mr Thrale dissolved the friendship between him and Johnson but it abated not in the latter that care for the interests of those whom his friend had left behind him which he thought himself bound to cherish as a living principle of gratitude The favours he had received from Mr Thrale were to be repaid by the exercise of kind offices towards his relict and her children and these circumstanced as Johnson was could only be prudent councils friendly admonition to the one and preceptive instruction to the others both which he was ever ready to interpose Nevertheless it was observed by myself and other of Johnson's friends that soon after the decease of Mr Thrale his visits to Streatham became  less and less frequent and that he studiously avoided the mention of the place or family  It seems that between him and the widow there was a formal taking of leave for I find in his diary the following note  ' April th I took leave of Mrs Thrale I was much moved I had some expostulations with her She said that she was likewise affected I commended the Thrales with great good will to God may my petitions have been heard'    Having now no calls and as I believe very little temptation to become a sojourner or even a guest in the habitation of his departed friend he had leisure to indulge himself in excursions to the city of his nativity as also to Oxford for both which places he ever entertained an enthusiastic affection In the former he was kindly received and respectfully treated by Mrs Lucy Porter the daughter by her former husband of his deceased wife and in the latter by the reverend Dr Adams who had been his tutor at Pembroke college and is now the head of that seminary While he was thus resident in the university he received daily proofs of the high estimation in which he was there held by such members of that body as were of the greatest eminence for learning or were any way distinguished for their natural or acquired abilities  Besides the places abovementioned Johnson had other summerretreats to which he was ever welcome the seats of his friends in the country At one of these in the year he was alarmed by a tumour by surgeons termed a sarcocele that as it increased gave him great pain and at length hurried him to town with a resolution to submit if it should be thought necessary to a dreadful chirurgical operation but on his arrival one less severe restored him to a  state of perfect ease in the part affected But he had disorders of another kind to struggle with he had frequent fits of pain which indicated the passage of a gallstone and he now felt the pressure of an asthma a constitutional disease with him from which he had formerly been relieved by copious bleedings but his advanced age forbade the repetition of them  In the beginning of the year death deprived him of his old friend and companion he who had for near forty years had the care of his health and had attended him almost constantly every morning to enquire after the state of his body and fill out his tea the mute the officious and the humble Mr Levett Of this disastrous event as soon as it happened Johnson sent to his friend Dr Lawrence the following account  Jan  SIR  Our old friend Mr Levett who was last night eminently chearful died this morning The man who lay in the same room hearing an uncommon noise got up and tried to make him speak but without effect He then called Mr Holder the apothecary who though when he came he thought him dead opened a vein but could draw no blood So has ended the long life of a very useful and very blameless man  I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON  I find in one of Johnson's diaries the following note  'January Sunday Robert Levett was buried in the churchyard of Bridewell between one and two in the afternoon He died on Thursday about seven in the morning by an instantaneous death He was an old and faithful friend I have known him from about CommendariMay God have had mercy on him May he have mercy on me'  The grief which the loss of friends occasioned Johnson seems to have been a frequent stimulative with him to composition His sense of Levett's worth he expressed in the following lines which may perhaps contribute more than any one circumstance in his character to keep the memory of his existence alive    Condemn'd to hope's delusive mine  As on we toil from day to day  By sudden blast or slow decline  Our social comforts drop away    Well tried through many a varying year  See Levett to the grave descend  Officious innocent sincere  Of every friendless name the friend    Yet still he fills affection's eye  Obscurely wise and coarsely kind  Nor letter'd ignorance deny  Thy praise to merit unrefin'd    When fainting nature call'd for aid  And hov'ring death prepar'd the blow  The vig'rous remedy display'd  The power of art without the show    In mis'ry's darkest caverns known  His useful care was ever nigh  Where hopeless anguish pour'd his groan  And lonely want retir'd to die    No summons mock'd by chill delay  No petty gain disdain'd by pride  The modest wants of ev'ry day  The toil of ev'ry day supply'd    His virtues walk'd their narrow round  Nor made a pause nor left a void  And sure the eternal Master found  The single talent well employ'd    The busy day the peaceful night  Unfelt uncounted glided by  His frame was firm his pow'rs were bright  Though now his eightieth year was nigh    Then with no throb of fiery pain  No cold gradations of decay  Death broke at once the vital chain  And freed his soul the nearest way  About the middle of June his constitution sustained a severer shock than it had ever before felt this was a stroke of the palsy so very sudden and severe that it awakened him out of a sound sleep and rendered him for a short time speechless As it had not affected his intellectual powers he in that cumbent posture to which he was confined attempted to repeat first in English then in Latin and afterwards in Greek the Lord's Prayer but succeeded in only the last effort immediately after which finding himself again bereft of the power of speech he rang for his servant and making signs for pen ink and paper wrote and sent the following note to his friend and nextdoor neighbour Mr Allen the printer  Dear Sir  It hath pleased Almighty God this morning to deprive me of the powers of speech and as I do not know but that it may be his farther good pleasure to deprive me soon of my senses I request you will on the receipt of this note come to me and act for me as the exigencies of my case may require  I am sincerely Your's S JOHNSON  Mr Allen immediately rose to his assistance and in the morning dispatched a message to Dr Heberden and Dr Brocklesby who in a few days so far relieved him that his speech became to a good degree articulate and till his organs began to tire he was able to hold conversation By the skill and attention of these two worthy persons he was at length restored to such a degree of health that on the th of the same month he was able to water his garden and had no remaining symptoms of disease excepting that his legs were observed to be swoln and he had some presages of an hydropic affection These gave him some concern and induced him to note more particularly than he had formerly done  Of his being seized with the palsy I find in his diary the following note  'June I went to bed and as I conceive about in the morning I had a stroke of the palsy  ' I sent for Dr Heberden and Dr Brocklesby God bless them  ' Dr Heberden took leave'  the variations of the state of his health  But bodily afflictions were not the only trials he had to undergo He had been a mourner for many friends and was now in danger of losing one who had not only cheared him in his solitude and helped him to pass with comfort those hours which otherwise would have been irksome to him but had relieved him from domestic cares regulated and watched over the expences of his house and kept at a distance some of those necessitous visitants towards whom his bounty though it had seldom wrought any good had often been exercised  This person was Mrs Williams whose calamitous history is related among the events recorded in the foregoing pages She had for some months been declining and during the doctor's late illness was confined to her bed The restoration of his health made it necessary for him to retire into the country but before his departure he composed and made use of the following energetic prayer  'Almighty God who in thy late visitation hast shewn mercy to me and now sendest to my companion disease and decay grant me grace so to employ the life which thou hast prolonged and the faculties which thou hast preserved and so to receive the admonition which the sickness of my friend by thy appointment gives me that I may be constant in all holy duties and be received at last to eternal happiness  'Permit O Lord thy unworthy creature to offer up this prayer for Anna Williams now languishing upon her bed and about to recommend herself to thy infinite mercy O God who desirest not the death of a sinner look down with mercy upon her forgive her sins and strengthen her faith Be merciful O Father of mercy to her and to me guide us by thy holy spirit through the remaining part of life support us in the hour of death and pardon us in the day of judgment for Jesus Christ's sake Amen'  During his absence from London viz on the sixth day of September Mrs Williams was released from all her cares and troubles by an easy death for which she was well prepared The last offices were performed for her by those of her friends who were  about her in the time of her illness and had administered to her all the assistance in their power  At his return to London Johnson found himself in a forlorn and helpless condition his habitual melancholy had now a real subject to work on and represented his house as a dreary mansion Solitude was ever ungrateful to him and the want of a companion with whom he might pass his evening hours often drove him to seek relief in the conversation of persons in all respects his inferiors To talk much and to be well attended to was throughout his life his chief delight his vein of discourse which has often enough been described was calculated to attract the applause and even admiration of small circles to him therefore a confraternity of persons assembled for the purpose of free communication or in other words a club could not but be a source of pleasure and he now projected one which will hereafter be described In every association of this kind he was sure unless by concession to preside and ex cathedra to discuss the subjects of enquiry and debate  The death of Mr Thrale and Johnson's estrangement from the dwelling and family of this his valued friend have already been mentioned it remains to say of this event that it was not followed by a total oblivion on the part of his relict of the intimacy that had subsisted between him and her husband it appearing that an intercourse by letters was still kept up between them It was nevertheless easy to discover by his conversation that he no longer looked on himself as a welcome guest at Streatham and that he did but ill brook the change in his course of life that he now experienced He had for near twenty years participated  in most of those enjoyments that make wealth and affiuence desirable had partaken in common with their owners of the delights of a villa and the convenience of an equipage and had been entertained with a variety of amusements and occupations In short during the whole of that period his life had been as happy as it had been in the power of such persons to make it  That this celebrated friendship subsisted so long as it did was a subject of wonder to most of Johnson's intimates for such were his habits of living that he was by no means a desirable inmate His unmanly thirst for tea made him very troublesome At Streatham he would suffer the mistress of the house to sit up and make it for him till two or three hours after midnight When retired to rest he indulged himself in the dangerous practice of reading in bed It was a very hard matter to get him decently dressed by dinnertime even when select companies were invited and no one could be sure that in his tableconversation with strangers he would not by contradiction or the general asperity of his behaviour offend them  These irregularities were not only borne with by Mr Thrale but he seemed to think them amply atoned for by the honour he derived from such a guest as no table in the three kingdoms could produce but he dying it was not likely that the same sentiments and opinions should descend to those of his family who were left behind Such a friendly connection and correspondence as I have just mentioned continued however between Johnson and the widow till it was interrupted by an event that will shortly be related  I have in his diary met with sundry notes signifying that while he was at Streatham he endeavoured by reading to acquire a knowledge of the Dutch language but that his progress in the study thereof was very slow  It has been already related that being seized with a paralysis about the month of June he was so far recovered therefrom as to entertain a hope that he had nearly worn out all his disorders  'What a man am I'  said he to me in the month of November following  'who have got the better of three diseases the palsy the gout and the asthma and can now enjoy the conversation of my friends without the interruptions of weakness or pain'  To these flattering testimonies I must add that in this seeming springtide of his health and spirits he wrote me the following note  Dear SIR  As Mr Ryland was talking with me of old friends and past times we warmed ourselves into a wish that all who remained of the club should meet and dine at the house which once was Horseman's in Ivy lane I have undertaken to solicit you and therefore desire you to tell on what day next week you can conveniently meet your old friends  I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON  Bolt court  Nov  Our intended meeting was prevented by a circumstance which the following note will explain  Dear SIR  In perambulating Ivy lane Mr Ryland found neither our landlord Horseman nor his successor The old house is shut up and he liked not the appearance of any near it he therefore bespoke our dinner at the Queen's Arms in St Paul's church yard where at half an hour after three your company will be desired today by those who remain of our former society  Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON  Dec  With this invitation I chearfully complied and met at the time and place appointed all who could be mustered of our society namely Johnson Mr Ryland and Mr Payne of the bank When we were collected the thought that we were so few occasioned some melancholy reflections and I could not but compare our meeting at such an advanced period of life as it was to us all to that of the four old men in the  'Senile Colloquium'  of Erasmus We dined and in the evening regaled with coffee At ten we broke up much to the regret of Johnson who proposed staying but finding us inclined to separate he left us with a sigh that seemed to come from his heart lamenting that he was retiring to solitude and chearless meditation  Johnson had proposed a meeting like this once a month and we had one more but the time approaching for a third he began to feel a return of some of his complaints and signified a wish that we would dine with him at his own house and accordingly we met there and were very chearfully entertained by him  A few days after he sent for me and informed me that he had discovered in himself the symptoms of a dropsy and indeed his very much increased bulk and the swoln appearance of his legs seemed to indicate no less He told me that he was desirous of making a will and requested me to be one of his executors upon my consenting to take on me the office he gave me to understand that he meant to make a provision for his servant Frank of about l a year for life and concerted with me a plan for investing a sum sufficient for the purpose at the same time he opened to me the state of his circumstances and the amount of what he had to dispose of  In a visit which I made him in a few days in consequence of a very pressing request to see me I found him labouring under great dejection of mind He bade me draw near him and said he wanted to enter into a serious conversation with me and upon my expressing a willingness to join in it he with a look that cut me to the heart told me that he had the prospect of death before him and that he dreaded to meet his Saviour I could not but be astonished at such a declaration and advised him as I had done once before to reflect on the course of his life and the services he had rendered to the cause of religion and virtue as well by his example as his writings to which he answered that he had written as a philosopher but had not lived like one In the estimation of his offences he reasoned thus  'Every man knows his own sins and also what grace he has resisted But to those of others and the circumstances under which they were committed he is a stranger he is therefore to look on himself as the greatest sinner that  he knows of  I find the above sentiment in Law's Serious call to a devout and holy life a book which Johnson was very conversant with and often commended  '  At the conclusion of this argument which he strongly enforced he uttered this passionate exclamation  'Shall I who have been a teacher of others myself be a castaway'  Much to the same purpose passed between us in this and other conversations that I had with him in all which I could not but wonder as much at the freedom with which he opened his mind and the compunction he seemed to feel for the errors of his past life as I did at his making choice of me for his confessor knowing full well how meanly qualified I was for such an office  It was on a Thursday that I had this conversation with him and here let not the supercilious lip of scorn protrude itself while I relate that in the course thereof he declared his intention to devote the whole of the next day to fasting humiliation and such other devotional exercises as became a man in his situation On the Saturday following I made him a visit and upon entering his room observed in his countenance such a serenity as indicated that some remarkable crisis of his disorder had produced a change in his feelings He told me that pursuant to the resolution he had mentioned to me he had spent the preceding day in an abstraction from all worldly concerns that to prevent interruption he had in the morning ordered Frank not to admit any one to him and the better to enforce the charge had added these awful words  'For your master is preparing himself to die'  He then mentioned to me that in the  course of this exercise he found himself relieved from that disorder which had been growing on him and was become very oppressing the dropsy by a gradual evacuation of water to the amount of twenty pints a like instance whereof he had never before experienced and asked me what I thought of it  I was well aware of the lengths that superstition and enthusiasm will lead men and how ready some are to attribute favourable events to supernatural causes and said that it might savour of presumption to say that in this instance God had wrought a miracle yet as divines recognize certain dispensations of his providence recorded in the Scripture by the denomination of returns of prayer and his omnipotence is now the same as ever I thought it would be little less than criminal to ascribe his late relief to causes merely natural and that the safer opinion was that he had not in vain humbled himself before his Maker He seemed to acquiesce in all that I said on this important subject and several times while I was discoursing with him cried out  'It is wonderful very wonderful'  His zeal for religion as manifested in his writings and conversation and the accounts extant that attest his piety have induced the enemies to his memory to tax him with superstition To that charge I oppose his behaviour on this occasion and leave it to the judgment of sober and rational persons whether such an unexpected event as that abovementioned would not have prompted a really superstitious man to some more passionate exclamation than that it was wonderful  Doubtless there are men who look upon all religious excercises as superstition and upon prayer and other acts of devotion as evidences of a weak mind These say that reason is a sufficient rule of action and that God needs not to be supplicated nor requires our thanks Of this class of infidels I take Annet to have been one he who wrote against the miracles and was some years ago convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to imprisonment The wife of Jackson the bookseller in Clare court Drury lane a man well known by the collectors of old books and pamphlets once told me that this man would often call in at their shop and if he happened to see a bible lying on the counter would intreat her to take it away for that he could not bear the sight of it    He had no sooner experienced the ease and comfort which followed from the remarkable event abovementioned than he began to entertain a hope that he had got the better of that disease which most oppressed him and that length of days might yet be his portion he therefore sought for a relief from that solitude to which the loss of Mrs Williams and others of his domestic companions seemed to have doomed him and in the same spirit that induced him to attempt the revival of the Ivy lane club set about the establishment of another I was not made privy to this his intention but all circumstances considered it was no matter of surprise to me when I heard as I did from a friend of mine that the great Dr Johnson had in the month of December formed a sixpenny club at an alehouse in Essexstreet and that though some of the members thereof were persons of note strangers under restrictions for three pence each night might three nights in a week hear him talk and partake of his conversation I soon afterwards learned from the doctor the nature of as also the motives to this institution which as to him was novel in this respect that as the presidency  passed in rotation he was oftner excluded from than entitled to enjoy that preeminence which at all times and in all convivial assemblies was considered as his right  The more intimate of Johnson's friends looked on this establishment both as a sorry expedient to kill time and a degradation of those powers which had administered delight to circles composed of persons of both sexes distinguished as well by their rank as by their talents for polite conversation It was a mortification to them to associate in idea the clink of the tankard with moral disquisition and literary investigation and many of them were led to question whether that pleasure could be very great which he had rendered so cheap they however concealed their sentiments and from motives of mere compassion suffered him to enjoy a comfort which was now become almost the only one of which he was capable and this he did for the short space of about ten months when the increase of his complaints obliged him to forego it  I have now brought him to the seventyfifth year of his age and the last of his life in which two remarkable events occurred the one whereof gave him great uneasiness and the other though much talked of little or none The time I am speaking of is the year by about the middle whereof he was to appearance so well recovered that both himself and his friends hoped that he had some years to live He had recovered from the paralytic stroke of the last year to such a degree that saving a little difficulty in his articulation he had no remains of it he had also undergone a slight fit of the gout and  conquered an oppression on his lungs so as to be able as himself told me to run up the whole staircase of the Royal Academy on the day of the annual dinner there In short to such a degree of health was he restored that he forgot all his complaints he resumed sitting to Opie for his picture which had been begun the year before but I believe was never finished and accepted an invitation to the house of a friend at Ashbourn in Derbyshire proposing to stay there till towards the end of the summer and in his return to visit Mrs Porter his daughterinlaw and others of his friends at Lichfield  A few weeks before his setting out he was made uneasy by a report that the widow of his friend Mr Thrale was about to dispose of herself in marriage to a foreigner a singer by profession and with him to quit the kingdom Upon this occasion he took the alarm and to prevent a degradation of herself and what as executor of her husband was more his concern the desertion of her children wrote to her she then being at Bath a letter a spurious copy whereof beginning  'If you are not already ignominiously married'  is inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine for December That this letter is spurious as to the language I have Johnson's own authority for saying but in respect of the sentiments he avowed it in a declaration to me that not a sentence of it was his but yet that it was an  adumbration  of one that he wrote upon the occasion It may therefore be suspected that some one who had heard him repeat the contents of the letter had given it to the public in the form in which it appeared  What answer was returned to his friendly monition  I know not but it seems that it was succeeded by a letter of greater length written as it afterwards appeared too late to do any good in which he expressed an opinion that the person to whom it was addressed had forfeited her fame The answer to this I have seen it is written from Bath and contains an indignant vindication as well of her conduct as her fame an inhibition of Johnson from following her to Bath and a farewell concluding  'Till you have changed your opinion oflet us converse no more'  In this transaction Johnson seemed to have forgotten the story of the Ephesian Matron related by Petronius but was by this time convinced that in his endeavours to prevent an attachment which he foresaw would be prejudicial to the interests of his friend's children and fix an indelible disgrace on their mother who was about to abandon them and her country he had been labouring to hedge in the cuckow From the style of the letter a conclusion was to be drawn that baffled all the powers of reasoning and persuasion  One argument she summ'd up all in  The thing was done and past recalling  Pope and Swift's Miscellanies  'Phyllis or the Progress of love'    which being the case he contented himself with reflecting on what he had done to prevent that which he thought one of the greatest evils that could befall the progeny of his friend the alienation of the affections of their mother He looked upon the desertion of children by their parents and the withdrawing from them that protection that mental nutriment which in their youth they are capable of receiving the exposing them to the snares and temptations of  the world and the solicitations and deceits of the artful and designing as most unnatural and in a letter on the subject to me written from Ashbourn thus delivered his sentiments  'Poor Thrale I thought that either her virtue or her vice' meaning as I understood by the former the love of her children and by the latter her pride 'would have restrained her from such a marriage She is now become a subject for her enemies to exult over and for her friends if she has any left to forget or pity'  In the mention of the above particulars it is far from my design to reprehend the conduct of the lady to whom they relate Being her own mistress she had a right to dispose of herself and is unamenable to any known judicature Johnson in his relation of executor to her husband as also in gratitude to his memory was under an obligation to promote the welfare of his family It was also his duty as far as he was able to avert an evil which threatened their interests What he endeavoured for that purpose is part of his history and as such only I relate it  While Dr Johnson was in the country his friends in town were labouring for his benefit Mr Thrale a short time before his death had meditated a journey to Italy and formed a party in which Johnson was included but the design never took effect It was now conceived by Johnson's friends that a foreign air would contribute to the restoration of his health and his inclination concurring with their sentiments a plan was formed for his visiting the continent attended with a maleservant The only obstacle to the journey was an apprehension that the expence of it would be  greater than his income would bear and to get over this difficulty Sir Joshua Reynolds undertook to solicit an addition of l to his pension and to that end applied to lord Thurlow who as the public have been fully informed exerted his endeavours for the purpose but the application failing he declared himself willing upon the security of that pension of which Johnson was in possession to advance him l  The offer abovementioned has in the first view of it the appearance rather of a commercial than a gratuitous transaction but Sir Joshua clearly understood at the making it that lord Thurlow designedly put it in that form he was fearful that Johnson's high spirit would induce him to reject it as a donation but thought that in the way of a loan it might be accepted  This generous offer Johnson thought proper to decline by a letter of which the following is an authentic copy being taken from his own draft now in my hands  My LORD  After a long and not inattentive observation of mankind the generosity of your lordship's offer raises in me not less wonder than gratitude Bounty so liberally bestowed I should gladly receive if my condition made it necessary for to such a mind who would not be proud to own his obligations But it has pleased God to restore me to so great a measure of health that if I should now appropriate so much of a fortune destined to do good I could not escape from myself the charge of advancing a false claim My journey to the continent though I once thought it necessary was never much encouraged by my physicians and I was very desirous  that your lordship should be told of it by Sir Joshua Reynolds as an event very uncertain for if I grew much better I should not be willing if much worse I should not be able to migrateYour lordship was first solicited without my knowledge but when I was told that you were pleased to honour me with your patronage I did not expect to hear of a refusal yet as I have had no long time to brood hope and have not rioted in imaginary opulence this cold reception has been scarce a disappointment and from your lordship's kindness I have received a benefit which only men like you are able to bestow I shall now live mihi carior with a higher opinion of my own merit  I am my lord Your lordship's most obliged Most grateful And most humble servant SAM JOHNSON  Sept  An incorrect copy of the above letter though of a private nature found its way into the public papers  Among the corruptions in the printed copies are the words  you was pleased  for  you were pleased  and  rested  for  ricted  in this manner It was given to Sir Joshua Reynolds unsealed to be delivered to lord Thurlow Sir Joshua looking upon it as a handsome testimony of gratitude and as it related to a transaction in which he had concerned himself took a copy of it and shewed it to a few of his friends Among these was a lady of quality who having heard it red the next day desired to be gratified with the perusal of it at home the use she made of this favour was the copying and sending it to one of the newspapers  whence it was taken and inserted in others as also in the Gentleman's and many other Magazines Johnson upon being told that it was in print exclaimed in my hearing'I am betrayed'but soon after forgot as he was ever ready to do all real or supposed injuries the error that made the publication possible  Dr Brocklesby was one of those physicians who would not encourage Johnson in a wish to visit the continent nevertheless to console him for his late disappointment and that the supposed narrowness of his circumstances might be no hindrance to such a design he made him a voluntary offer of l a year payable quarterly towards his support abroad but could not prevail on him to accept it  Actuated by a like spirit of beneficence the same person by his interest with his friends and in conjunction with that christianlike jew Sampson Gideon procured a contribution amounting to upwards of l a year for the support during the remaining years of his life of old captain Coram the original mover in the establishment of the Foundlinghospital Upon Dr Brocklesby's applying to the good old man to know whether his setting on foot a subscription for his benefit would not offend him he received this noble answer  'I have not wasted the little wealth of which I was formerly possessed in selfindulgence or vain expences and am not ashamed to confess that in this my old age I am poor'  Upon the death of Coram this pension was continued to Leveridge a wornout singer at the theatres who at the age of ninety had scarce any other prospect than that of a parish subsistence  Those writers on morality such as Hobbes and Mandeville who resolve all beneficence into selslove would be hard put to it to reconcile such acts as these with their tenets They would say that the motive to them was a desire to get rid of those sensations which the distresses of others are apt to excite and by consequence that the exertions of beneficence are selfish Never considering that before these sensations can arise a man must be kindly affectioned to his fellowcreatures and possess that benevolence which the objection supposes to be wanting    His excursion to Ashbourn was less beneficial than he hoped it would be his disorders began to return and he wanted company and amusement During his stay there he composed sundry prayers adapted to the state of his body and mind and translated from Horace lib IV the ode  'Diffugêre nives redeunt jam gramina campis'  in the words following  The snow dissolv'd no more is seen  The fields and woods behold are green  The changing year renews the plain  The rivers know their banks again  The sprightly nymph and naked grace  The mazy dance together trace  The changing year's successive plan  Proclaims mortality to Man  Rough winter's blasts to spring give way  Spring yields to summer's sovereign ray  Then summer sinks in autumn's reign  And winter chills the world again  Her losses soon the moon supplies  But wretched Man when once he lies  Where Priam and his sons are laid  Is nought but ashes and a shade  Who knows if Jove who counts our score  Will rouse us in a morning more  What with your friend you nobly share  At least you rescue from your heir  Not you Torquatus boast of Rome  When Minos once has fix'd your doom  Or eloquence or splendid birth  Or virtue shall replace on earth  Hippolytus unjustly slain  Diana calls to life in vain  Nor can the might of Theseus rend  The chains of hell that hold his friend  Nov  In his return to London he stopped at Lichfield and from thence wrote to me several letters that served but to prepare me for meeting him in a worse state of health than I had ever seen him in The concluding paragraph of the last of them is as follows  'I am relapsing into the dropsy very fast and shall make such haste to town that it will be useless to write to me but when I come let me have the benefit of your advice and the consolation of your company' dated Nov  After about a fortnight's stay there he took his leave of that city and of Mrs Porter whom he never afterwards saw and arrived in town on the sixteenth day of November  After the declaration he had made of his intention to provide for his servant Frank and before his going into the country I had frequently pressed him to make a will and had gone so far as to make a draft of one with blanks for the names of the executors and residuary legatee and directing in what manner it was to be executed and attested but he was exceedingly averse to this business and while he was in Derbyshire I repeated my solicitations for this purpose by letters When he arrived in town he had done nothing in it and to what I formerly said I now added that he had never mentioned to me the disposal of the residue of his estate which  after the purchase of an annuity for Frank I found would be something considerable and that he would do well to bequeath it to his relations His answer was  'I care not what becomes of the residue'  A few days after it appeared that he had executed the draft the blanks remaining with all the solemnities of a real will I could get him no farther and thus for some time the matter rested  He had scarce arrived in town before it was found to be too true that he was relapsing into a dropsy and farther that he was at times grievously afflicted with an asthma Under an apprehension that his end was approaching he enquired of Dr Brocklesby with great earnestness indeed how long he might probably live but could obtain no other than unsatisfactory answers and at the same time if I remember right under a seeming great pressure of mind he thus addressed him in the words of Shakespeare  Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas'd  Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow  Raze out the written troubles of the brain  And with some sweet oblivious antidote  Cleanse the full bosom of that perilous stuff  Which weighs upon the heart  MACBETH  To which the doctor who was nearly as well red in the above author as himself readily replied  Therein the patient  Must minister unto himself  Upon which Johnson exclaimed  'Well appliedthat's more than poetically true'  He had from the month of July in this year marked the progress of his diseases in a journal which he intitled  'Aegri Ephemeris'  noting therein his many sleepless nights by the words Nox insomnis This he often contemplated and finding very little ground for hope that he had much longer to live he set himself to prepare for his dissolution and betook himself to private prayer and the reading of Erasmus on the New Testament Dr Clarke's sermons and such other books as had a tendency to calm and comfort him  In this state of his body and mind he seemed to be very anxious in the discharge of two offices that he had hitherto neglected to perform one was the communicating to the world the names of the persons concerned in the compilation of the Universal History the other was the rescuing from oblivion the memory of his father and mother and also of his brother the former of these he discharged by delivering to Mr Nichols the printer in my presence a paper containing the information abovementioned and directions to deposit it in the British museum The other by composing a memorial of his deceased parents and his brother intended for their tombstone which whether it was ever inscribed thereon or not is extant in the Gentleman's Magazine for January The note ascertaining the names of the compilers of the Universal History is inserted in the Magazine for the preceding month The monumental inscription is as follows  H S E  MICHAEL JOHNSON  Vir impavidus constans animosus periculorum immemor laborum patientissimus fiduciâ christianâ  fortis fervidusque paterfamilias apprimè strenuus bibliopolà admodum peritus mente et libris et negotiis exculta animo ita firmo ut rebus adversis diu conflictatus nec sibi nec suis defuerit lingua sic temperata ut ei nihil quod aures vel pias vel castas laesisset aut dolor

Varvicensi anno MDCLXIX obiit MDCCLIX  Cum NATHANAELE illorum filio qui natus MDCCXII cum vires et animi et corporis multa pollicerentur anno MDCCXXXVII vitam brevem piâ morte finivit  He would also have written in Latin verse an epitaph for Mr Garrick but found himself unequal to the task of original poetic composition in that language  Nevertheless he succeeded in an attempt to render into Latin metre from the Greek Anthologia sundry of the epigrams therein contained that had been omitted by other translators alledging as a reason which he had found in Fabricius that Henry Stephens Buchanan Grotius and others had paid a like tribute to  literature  To these may be added the examples of Sir Thomas More and Lily the grammarian both of whose translations are published among Sir Thomas More's epigrams  The performance of this task was the employment of his sleepless nights and as he imformed me it afforded him great relief  His complaints still increasing I continued pressing him to make a will but he still procrastinated that business On the twentyseventh of November in the morning I went to his house with a purpose still farther to urge him not to give occasion by dying intestate for litigation among his relations but finding that he was gone to pass the day with the reverend Mr Strahan at Islington I followed him thither and found there our old friend Mr Ryland and Mr Hoole Upon my sitting down he said that the prospect of the change he was about to undergo and the thought of meeting his Saviour troubled him but that he had hope that he would not reject him I then began to discourse with him about his will and the provision for Frank till he grew angry He told me that he had signed and sealed the paper I left himbut that said I had blanks in it which as it seems you have not filled up with the names of the executors  'You should have filled them up yourself'  answered heI replied that such an act would have looked as if I meant to prevent his choice of a fitter person  'Sir' said he 'these minor virtues are not to be exercised in matters of such importance as this'  At length he said that on his return home he would send for a clerk and dictate a will to himYou will then said I be inops consilii rather do it now  With Mr Strahan's permission I will be his guest at dinner and if Mr Hoole will please to hold the pen I will in a few words make such a disposition of your estate as you shall directTo this he assented but such a paroxysm of the asthma seized him as prevented our going on As the fire burned up he found himself relieved and grew chearful  'The fit' said he 'was very sharp but I am now easy'  After I had dictated a few lines I told him that the ancient form of wills contained a profession of the faith of the testator and that he being a man of eminence for learning and parts it would afford an illustrious example and well become him to make such an explicit declaration of his belief as might obviate all suspicions that he was any other than a Christian  After the Roman empire became Christian not only the testaments of dying men but the imperial edicts began with an invocation of the name of God or of the holy and undivided Trinity The institutes of Justinian begin  'In nomine Domini nostri Jesu Christi'  and till lately the address of grants and charters has been  'To all Christian people'  Vide Sir Henry Spelman of antient Deeds and Charters among his English works A few years ago it was the uniform practice to begin wills with the words  'In the name of God amen'  and frequently to insert therein a declaration of the testator's hope of pardon in the merits of his Saviour but in these more refined times such forms are deemed superfluous  He thanked me for the hint and calling for paper wrote on a slip that I had in my hand and gave him the following words  'I humbly commit to the infinite and eternal goodness of Almighty God my soul polluted with many sins but as I hope purified by repentance and redeemed as I trust by the death of Jesus Christ'  and returning it to me said  'This I commit to your custody'  Upon my calling on him for directions to proceed he told me that his father in the course of his trade of a bookseller had become bankrupt and that Mr William Innys had assisted him with money or credit to continue his business  'This' said he 'I consider as an obligation on me to be grateful to his descendants and I therefore mean to give l to his representative'  He then meditated a devise of his house at Lichfield to the corporation of that city for a charitable use but it being freehold he said  'I cannot live a twelvemonth and the last statute of mortmain  Viz Geo cap which enacts that no lands tenements c shall be given to any bodies politic unless by deed indented made twelve months at least before the death of the donor  stands in the way I must therefore think of some other disposition of it'  His next consideration was a provision for Frank concerning the amount whereof I found he had been consulting Dr Brocklesby to whom he had put this question  'What would be a proper annuity to bequeath to a favourite servant'  The doctor answered that the circumstances of the master were the truest measure and that in the case of a nobleman l a year was deemed an adequate reward for many years' faithful service  'Then shall I' said Johnson 'be nobilissimus for I mean to leave Frank l a year and I desire you to tell him so'  And now at the making of the will a devise equivalent to such a provision was therein inserted The residue of his estate and effects which took in though he intended it not the house at Lichfield he bequeathed to his executors in trust for a religious association which it is needless to describe  Having executed the will with the necessary formalities he would have come home but being pressed by Mr and Mrs Strahan to stay he consented and we all dined together Towards the evening he grew chearful and I having promised to take him in my coach Mr Strahan and Mr Ryland would accompany him home In the way thither he appeared much at ease and told stories At eight I set him down and Mr Strahan and Mr Ryland betook themselves to their respective homes  Sunday th I saw him about noon he was dozing but waking he found himself in a circle of his friends Upon opening his eyes he said that the prospect of his dissolution was very terrible to him and addressed himself to us all in nearly these words  'You see the state in which I am conflicting with bodily pain and mental distraction while you are in health and strength labour to do good and avoid evil if ever you hope to escape the distress that now oppresses me'A little while after'I had very early in my life the seeds of goodness in me I had a love of virtue and a reverence for religion and these I trust have brought forth in me fruits meet for repentance and if I have repented as I ought I am forgiven I have at times entertained a loathing of sin and of myself particularly at the beginning of this year when I had the prospect of death before me and this has not abated when my fears of death have been less and at these times I have had such rays of hope shot into my soul as have almost persuaded me that I am in a state of reconciliation with God'  th Mr Langton who had spent the evening with him reported that his hopes were increased and that he was much cheared upon being reminded of the general tendency of his writings and of his example  th I saw him in the evening and found him chearful Was informed that he had for his dinner eaten heartily of a French duck pie and a pheasant  Dec He was busied in destroying papersGave to Mr Langton and another person to fair copy some translations of the Greek epigrams which he had made in the preceding nights and transcribed the next morning and they began to work on them  d Finding his legs continue to swell he signified to his physicians a strong desire to have them scarified but they unwilling to put him to pain and fearing a mortification declined advising it He afterwards consulted his surgeon and he performed the operation on one leg  th I visited him the scarification made yesterday in his leg appeared to have had little effectHe said to me that he was easier in his mind and as fit to die at that instant as he could be a year henceHe requested me to receive the sacrament with him on Sunday the next day Complained of great weakness and of phantoms that haunted his imagination  th Being Sunday I communicated with him and Mr Langton and other of his friends as many as nearly filled the room Mr Strahan who was constant in his attendance on him throughout his illness performed the office Previous to reading the exhortation Johnson knelt and with a degree of fervour that I had never been witness to before  uttered the following most eloquent and energetic prayer  'Almighty and most merciful Father I am now as to human eyes it seems about to commemorate for the last time the death of thy son Jesus Christ our Saviour and Redeemer Grant O Lord that my whole hope and confidence may be in his merits and in thy mercy forgive and accept my late conversion enforce and accept my imperfect repentance make this commemoration of him available to the confirmation of my faith the establishment of my hope and the enlargement of my charity and make the death of thy son Jesus effectual to my redemption Have mercy upon me and pardon the multitude of my offences Bless my friends have mercy upon all men Support me by the grace of they holy spirit in the days of weakness and at the hour of death and receive me at my death to everlasting happiness for the sake of Jesus ChristAmen'  Upon rising from his knees after the office was concluded he said that he dreaded to meet God in a state of idiocy or with opium in his head and that having now communicated with the effects of a dose upon him he doubted if his exertions were the genuine operations of his mind and repeated from bishop Taylor this sentiment  'That little that has been omitted in health can be done to any purpose in sickness  He very much admired and often in the course of his illness recited from the conclusion of old Isaac Walton's life of bishop Sanderson the following pathetic request  'Thus this pattern of meekness and primitive innocence changed this for a better life'tis now too late to wish that mine may be like his for I am in the eightyfifth year of my age and God knows it hath not but I most humbly beseech Almighty God that my death may and I do as earnestly beg that if any reader shall receive any satisfaction from this very plain and as true relation he will be so charitable as to say Amen'    th I again visited him Before my departure Dr Brocklesby came in and taking him by the wrist Johnson gave him a look of great contempt and ridiculed the judging of his disorder by the pulse He complained that the sarcocele had again made its appearance and asked if a puncture would not relieve him as it had done the year before the doctor answered that it might but that his surgeon was the best judge of the effect of such an operation Johnson upon this said  'How many men in a year die through the timidity of those whom they consult for health I want length of life and you fear giving me pain which I care not for'  th I visited him with Mr Langton and found him dictating to Mr Strahan another will the former being as he had said at the time of making it a temporary one On our entering the room he said  'God bless you both'  I arrived just time enough to direct the execution and also the attestation of it After he had published it he desired Mr Strahan to say the Lord's prayer which he did all of us joining Johnson after it uttered extempore a few pious ejaculations  th I saw him in the evening and found him dictating to Mr Strahan a codicil to the will he had  made the evening before I assisted them in it and received from the testator a direction to insert a devise to his executors of the house at Lichfield to be sold for the benefit of certain of his relations a bequest of sundry pecuniary and specific legacies a provision for the annuity of l for Francis and after all a devise of all the rest residue and remainder of his estate and effects to his executors in trust for the said Francis Barber his executors and administrators and having dictated accordingly Johnson executed and published it as a codicil to his will  How much soever I approve of the practice of rewarding the fidelity of servants I cannot but think that in testamentary dispositions in their favour some discretion ought to be exercised and that in scarce any instance they are to be preferred to those who are allied to the testator either in blood or by affinity Of the merits of this servant a judgment may be formed from what I shall hereafter have occasion to say of him It was hinted to me many years ago by his master that he was a loose fellow and I learned from others that after an absence from his service of some years he married In his search of a wife he picked up one of those creatures with whom in the disposal of themselves no contrariety of colour is an obstacle It is said that soon after his marriage he became jealous and it may be supposed that he continued so till by presenting him first with one and afterwards with another daughter of her own colour his wife put an end to all his doubts on that score Notwithstanding which Johnson in the excess of indiscriminating benevolence about a year before his death took the wife and both the children into his house and made them a part of his family and by the codicil to his will made a disposition in his favour to the amount in value of full fifteen hundred pounds    He was now so weak as to be unable to kneel and lamented that he must pray sitting but with an effort he placed himself on his knees while Mr Strahan repeated the Lord's Prayer During the whole of the evening he was much composed and resigned Being become very weak and helpless it was  thought necessary that a man should watch with him all night and one was found in the neighbourhood who for half a crown a night undertook to sit up with and assist him When the man had left the room he in the presence and hearing of Mr Strahan and Mr Langton asked me where I meant to bury him I answered doubtless in Westminster abbey  'If' said he 'my executors think it proper to mark the spot of my interment by a stone let it be so placed as to protect my body from injury'  I assured him it should be done Before my departure he desired Mr Langton to put into my hands money to the amount of upwards of l with a direction to keep it till called for  th This day at noon I saw him again He said to me that the male nurse to whose care I had committed him was unfit for the office  'He is' said he 'an idiot as aukward as a turnspit just put into the wheel and as sleepy as a dormouse'  Mr Cruikshank came into the room and looking on his scarified leg saw no sign of a mortification  th At noon I found him dozing and would not disturb him  th Saw him again found him very weak and as he said unable to pray  th At noon I called at the house but went not into his room being told that he was dozing I was further informed by the servants that his appetite was totally gone and that he could take no sustenance At eight in the evening of the same day word was brought me by Mr Sastres to whom in his last moments he uttered these words  'Jam moriturus'  that at a quarter past seven he had without a groan or the least sign of pain or uneasiness yielded his last breath  At eleven the same evening Mr Langton came to me and in an agony of mind gave me to understand that our friend had wounded himself in several parts of the body I was shocked at the news but upon being told that he had not touched any vital part was easily able to account for an action which would else have given us the deepest concern The fact was that conceiving himself to be full of water he had done that which he had often solicited his medical assistants to do made two or three incisions in his lower limbs vainly hoping for some relief from the flux that might follow  Early the next morning Frank came to me and being desirous of knowing all the particulars of this transaction I interrogated him very strictly concerning it and received from him answers to the following effect  That at eight in the morning of the preceding day upon going into the bedchamber his master being in bed ordered him to open a cabinet and give him a drawer in it that he did so and that out of it his master took a case of lancets and choosing one of them would have conveyed it into the bed which Frank and a young man that sat up with him seeing they seized his hand and intreated him not to do a rash action he said he would not but drawing his hand under the bedclothes they saw his arm move Upon this they turned down the clothes and saw a great effusion of blood which soon stoppedThat soon after he got at a pair of scissars that lay in a drawer by him and plunged them deep in the calf of each legThat immediately they sent for Mr Cruikshank and the apothecary and they or one of them dressed the woundsThat he then fell into that dozing which  carried him offThat it was conjectured he lost eight or ten ounces of blood and that this effusion brought on the dozing though his pulse continued firm till three o'clock  That this act was not done to hasten his end but to discharge the water that he conceived to be in him I have not the least doubt A dropsy was his disease he looked upon himself as a bloated carcase and to attain the power of easy respiration would have undergone any degree of temporary pain He dreaded neither punctures nor incisions and indeed defied the trochar and the lancet he had often reproached his physicians and surgeon with cowardice and when Mr Cruikshank scarified his leg he cried out  'Deeper deeperI will abide the consequence you are afraid of your reputation but that is nothing to me'  To those about him he said  'You all pretend to love me but you do not love me so well as I myself do'  I have been thus minute in recording the particulars of his last moments because I wished to attract attention to the conduct of this great man under the most trying circumstances human nature is subject to Many persons have appeared possessed of more serenity of mind in this awful scene some have remained unmoved at the dissolution of the vital union and it may be deemed a discouragement from the severe practice of religion that Dr Johnson whose whole life was a preparation for his death and a conflict with natural infirmity was disturbed with terror at the prospect of the grave Let not this relax the circumspection of any one It is true that natural firmness of spirit or the  confidence of hope may buoy up the mind to the last but however heroic an undaunted death may appear it is not what we should pray for As Johnson lived the life of the righteous his end was that of a Christian he strictly fulfilled the injunction of the apostle to work out his salvation with fear and trembling and though his doubts and scruples were certainly very distressing to himself they give his friends a pious hope that he who added to almost all the virtues of Christianity that religious humility which its great Teacher inculcated will in the fullness of time receive the reward promised to a patient continuance in welldoing  A few days after his departure Dr Brocklesby and Mr Cruikshank who with great assiduity and humanity and I must add generosity for neither they nor Dr Heberden Dr Warren nor Dr Butter would accept any fees had attended him signified a wish that his body might be opened This was done and the report made was to this effect  Two of the valves of the aorta oslified  The aircells of the lungs unusually distended  One of the kidneys destroyed by the pressure of the water  The liver schirrous  A stone in the gallbladder of the size of a common gooseberry  On Monday the th of December his funeral was celebrated and honoured by a numerous attendance of his friends and among them by particular invitation of as many of the literary club as were then in town and not prevented by engagements The dean of Westminster upon my application would  gladly have performed the ceremony of his interment but at the time was much indisposed in his health the office therefore devolved upon the senior prebendary Dr Taylor who performed it with becoming gravity and seriousness All the prebendaries except such as were absent in the country attended in their surplices and hoods they met the corpse at the west door of their church and performed in the most respectful manner all the honours due to the memory of so great a man  His body enclosed in a leaden coffin is deposited in the south transept of the abbey near the foot of Shakespeare's monument and close to the coffin of his friend Garrick Agreeable to his request a stone of black marble covers his grave thus inscribed  SAMUEL JOHNSON LLD  Obiit XIII die

and Testament in the presence of us who in his presence and at his request and also in the presence of each other have hereto subscribed our names as witnesses  JOHN COPLEY  WILLIAM GIBSON  HENRY COLE  POSTSCRIPT  THE foregoing instrument carries into effect the resolution of Dr Johnson to be with respect to his negroservant  nobilissimus  but the many lavish encomiums that have been bestowed on this act of bounty make it necessary to mention some particulars subsequent to his death that will serve to shew the shortsightedness of human wisdom and the effects of illdirected benevolence  The amount of the bequest to this man may be estimated at a sum little short of l and that to the testator's relations named in the will at l the sum which the house at Lichfield produced at a sale by auction who being five in number divided the same after deducting the expences of the sale in the following proportions that is to say three of the relations took l s d each and each of two others the representatives of a fourth l s d  A few days after the doctor's decease Francis came to me and informed me that a relation of his master's named Humphrey Heely who with his wife had lately upon the request of the doctor to the bishop of Rochester been placed in an almshouse at Westminster was in great necessity as wanting money to buy bedding and cloaths I told him that seeing he was so great a gainer by his master's will as to be possessed of almost the whole of his fortune it behoved him to have compassion on this his relation and to supply his wants His reply was  '  I cannot afford it  '  From the time of the doctor's decease myself and my colleagues the other executors answered all the calls of Francis for money On the th day of September we had advanced him l By the th of December following he had received of Mr Langton for his annuity and of Mess Barclay and Perkins for interest as much as made that sum l and on the th of the same month a year and two days after his master's death he came to me saying that he wanted more money for that a few halfpence was all that he had left Upon my settling with him in August last it appeared that exclusive of his annuity he had received l and after delivering to him the bond for l mentioned in the will  He had before received l for interest thereon  I paid him a balance of l s d¾  I had no sooner closed my account than I sent for Heely who appeared to be an old man and lame having one leg much shorter than the other but of an excellent understanding The style of his discourse was so correct and grammatical that it called to my remembrance that of Johnson The account he gave me of himself and his fortunes was to the following effect  That he was born in the year and that his relation to Johnson was by marriage his first wife being a Ford and the daughter of Johnson's mother's brotherThat himself had been a wholesale ironmonger and the owner of an estate in Warwickshire which he farmed himself but that losses and some indiscretions on his part had driven him to Scotland and that in his return on foot with his wife from  Newcastle she died on the road in his armsthat some years after he was by Sir Thomas Robinson made keeper of the Tap at Ranelagh house and that he married again but that not being able to endure the capricious insolence with which he was treated Mr Garrick took him under his protection and would have found a place for him in his theatre but lived not to be able to do it and that these and other misfortunes and disappointments had brought him to the condition as he described it of a poor reduced old manHe added that Dr Johnson had been very liberal to him and as one instance of his kindness mentioned that about three weeks before his decease he had applied to him for assistance and upon stating his reasons for troubling him was bid rather harshly to be silent  'For' said the doctor 'it is enough to say that you are in want I enquire not into the causes of it here is money for your relief  We have here an instance of that asperity of temper with which Johnson has been frequently charged but without any allowance for natural infirmity or any consideration of his endeavours to correct it or his readiness to atone for the pain it might sometimes give by a kind and gentle treatment of the person offended The truth of the matter is that his whole life was a conflict with his passions and humours and that few persons bore reprehension with more patience than himself After his decease I found among his papers an anonymous letter that seemed to have been written by a person who had long had his eye on him and remarked the offensive particulars in his behaviour his propensity to contradiction his want of deference to the opinions of others his contention for victory over those with whom he disputed his local prejudices and aversions and other his evil habits in converiation which made his acquaintance shunned by many who as a man of genius and worth highly esteemed him It was written with great temper in a spirit of charity and with a due acknowledgment of those great talents with which he was endowed but contained in it several home truths In short it was such a letter as many a one on the receipt of it would have destroyed On the contrary Johnson preserved it and placed it in his bureau in a situation so obvious that whenever he opened that repository of his papers it might look him in the face and I have not the least doubt that he frequently perused and reflected on its contents and endeavoured to correct his behaviour by an address which he could not but consider as a friendly admonition  '  but that immediately recollecting himself  he changed his tone and mildly said  'If I have spoken roughly to you impute it to the distraction of my mind and the petulance of a sick man'  Describing his present condition he said that he and his wife were in want of every necessary and that neither of them had a change of any one article of raiment  To be better informed of his circumstances I visited this person in the almshouse and was there a witness to such a scene of distress as I had never till then beheld A sorry bed with scarce any covering on it two or three old trunks and boxes a few broken chairs and an old table were all the furniture of the room I found him smoking and while I was talking with him a ragged boy about ten years of age came in from the garden and upon my enquiring who he was the old man said  'This is a child whom a worthless father has left on our hands I took him to keep at four shillings a week and for four years maintenance have not been able to get more than five pounds four shillings the poor child is an idiot he cannot repeat the Lord's Prayer and is unable to count five we know not how to dispose of him and if we did we could hardly prevail on  ourselves to part with him for it is a harmless loving creature we divide our morsel with him and are just able to keep him from starving'  Upon enquiring into the means of this poor man's subsistence he informed me that the endowment of the almshouses in one of which he lived yielded him an allowance of half a crown a week and half a chaldron of coals at Christmas That his wife bought milk and sold it again and thereby was able to get about a shilling a day The scantiness of his income he said had obliged him and his wife to study the art of cheap living and he felicitated himself that they were become such proficients therein as to be able to abstain from drinking except at their supper meal when as he said they each indulged in a pint of beer which sufficed them for four and twenty hours He told me all this in a tremulous tone of voice that indicated a mind that had long struggled with affliction but without the least murmur at his hard fortune or complaint of the doctor's neglect of him in short he appeared to me such an examplar of meekness and patience in adversity as the best of men in similar circumstances might wish to imitate  Johnson had also a first cousin Elizabeth Herne a lunatic whom upon her discharge from Bethlem hospital as incurable he had placed in a madhouse at Bethnal green A lady of the name of Prowse had bequeathed to her an annuity of l and Johnson constantly paid the bills for her keeping which amounting to l a year made him a benefactor to her of the difference between those two sums  The doctor by his will bequeathed to the reverend Mr Rogers who had married the daughter of Mrs Prowse l towards the maintenance of the lunatic but he probably considering that the interest of that sum would fall far short of what Johnson had been used to contribute and that the burthen of supporting her would lie on himself renounced the legacy Had the doctor left her for her life the dividends of l part of his stock she had sustained no loss at his death as the matter now stands I must apply the l for her maintenance and if she lives to exhaust it must seek out the place of her last legal settlement and remit her to the care of a parish  Of the craft and selfishness of the doctor's negroservant the following is a notable instance At the time of his master's death Mrs Herne's maintenance was about l in arrear I was applied to for the money and shewed the bill to him upon which be immediately went to the madhouse and endeavoured to prevail on the keeper thereof to charge it on the legacy but he refused to do it saying that the lunatic was placed there by Dr Johnson and that it was a debt incurred in his lifetime and by consequence was payable out of his effects When this would not do this artful fellow came to me and pretended that he could bring a woman to swear that there was nothing due and upon my telling him that I should notwithstanding pay the bill he said he saw there was no good intended for him and in anger left me    That the name of the poor man Heely occurs not in the will and that no better a provision is therein made for the lunatic Herne than a legacy which may fail to support her through life can no otherwise be accounted for than by the doctor's postponing that last solemn act of his life and his making a disposition of what he had to leave under circumstances that disabled him from recollecting either their relation  to him or the distresses they severally laboured under Any other supposition would be injurious to the memory of a man who by his private memoranda in my possession appears to have applied near a fourth part of his income in acts of beneficence  The above facts are so connected with the transactions of Dr Johnson in the latter days of his life that they are part of his history and the mention of them may serve as a caveat against ostentatious bounty favour to negroes and testamentary dispositions  in extremis  It will afford some satisfaction to the compassionate reader to know that the means of benefiting Heely and some others of Dr Johnson's relations whom he had either totally neglected or slightly noticed have been found out and rendered practicable by Mr Langton That gentleman to whom the doctor had given his manuscript Latin poems having got for them of the booksellers l with that benignity which is but one of his excellent qualities had determined to divide the same among the doctor's relations And whereas the doctor died indebted to the estate of the late Mr Beauclerk in the sum of l lady Diana Beauclerk his relict and executrix upon the receipt thereof and being informed of Mr Langton's intention in a spirit of true benevolence requested that she might be permitted to add that sum to the former and accordingly deposited it in his hands Part of this money has been applied in relieving the wants of Heely and his wife and the rest will be disposed of among those relations that shall appear to stand most in need of help and as a farther relief to Heely and for the benefit of the idiotboy measures are taking to compel the father to maintain him and eventually to settle him with the parish upon which he has ultimately a legal claim for relief and maintenance  FINIS  INDEX  A  ABissinia  account of the Portuguese mission
