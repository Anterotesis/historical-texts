 DOCTOR BERKELEY's CAUTION AGAINST SOCINIANISM  Price One Shilling  A CAUTION AGAINST SOCINIANISM GIVEN IN A DISCOURSE PREACHED AT THE CATHEDRAL AND METROPOLITICAL CHURCH OF CHRIST CANTERBURY On GOOD FRIDAY AND PUBLISHED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CHARITYSCHOOLS IN THE PARISH OF ST CLEMENT DANES WESTMINSTER  By GEORGE BERKELEY LLD LATE STUDENT OF CHRIST CHURCH OXFORD VICEDEAN OF CANTERBURY CHANCELLOR OF BRECKNOCK RECTOR OF SAINT CLEMENT DANES WESTMINSTER AND VICAR OF COOKHAM BERKS  CANTERBURY PRINTED FOR SIMMONS AND KIRKBY T SMITH AND FLACKTON AND MARRABLE AND FOR  GARDNER OPPOSITE ST CLEMENT'S CHURCH STRAND LONDON MDCCLXXXVII  ROM v  GOD COMMENDETH HIS LOVE TOWARDS US IN THAT WHILE WE WERE YET SINNERS CHRIST DIED FOR US  THE awful event which we this day commemorate is by far the most important of any that ever took place upon the theatre of this world  IT is that which from the transgression of our first parents a long line of prophets were commissioned to predict which priests and sacrifices were appointed to prefigure and which the revolutions of empires were contrived to introduce It is that which reconciled us unto GOD rescuing us from the tyranny of sin and the power of the grave Yet in the whole gospel there is nothing against which the pride of human reason and the perverseness of human prejudices have more obstinately opposed themselves than the sacrifice of the everlasting and equal SON of GOD as a full perfect and sufficient satisfaction for the sins of the whole world  In the very first age of Christianity and while the precious blood of the world's Redeemer was yet recently shed at Jerusalem there sprang up in the church a sect which ashamed of being the disciples of one who had been crucified as a malefactor boldly affirmed that their  Master had  not  suffered but that without tasting death he was taken up into heaven whilst Pilate and the Jews wreaked their impotent malice upon an airy phantom in his similitude  To these heretics after a few centuries succeeded the Impostor of Arabiawho from motives of policy denied the sufferings of CHRIST The great scheme of universal redemption commenced with the fall and its gracious design was by degrees to restore mankind to that state which they had forfeited in Adam  BUT the sagacious deceiver well knew that if the death and resurrection were admitted  that  design would be seen to be completed and that his  own  pretensions of being divinely commissioned to close the seal of prophecy and to communicate the last offer of mercy and instruction to lapsed humanity must instantly fall to the ground  WITH an effrontery then peculiar to himself he denied the truth of a fact on which Christians reposed all their hopes in which the Jews exulted with malicious triumph and of which the history was spread over the whole civilized world  THE success of Mahomet is well known and it is likewise known that ever since his days the Christian church has been infested with a pestilent race of men who though they believe not in the inspiration of the Koran and though they deny not the sufferings of HIM at whose name St Paul directs that every knee should bow yet do they lay no more  stress  on those sufferings than upon the sufferings of  Socrates  or any other man who has laid down his life in attestation of the truth If the Mahometan denies like the Phantomist of more ancient  times the  reality  of the death of CHRIST the Socinian by denying its  efficacy  sinks it to the level of common martyrdom and though the fact itself be  not  questioned its  end  and  design  is in  his  creed totally lost  THERE is a living writer a teacher of the gospel and if you will believe his adherents a sincere Christian who supports this horrid heresy with all his abilities and who labours to disseminate it with astonishing zeal whose followers are scattered all over England and  against whom  as they insinuate themselves into every company and commonly make their attacks upon the ignorant and the halflearned every Christian ought to be upon his guard  AGAINST Socinians Arians and all other enemies of the truth the surest defence will be found to be the sword of the Spirit which is the word of GOD Would mankind take their faith from the holy scriptures and  not  rest it upon the unstable foundation of human systems and would no man presumptuously aim at being  wise beyond what is written  heresies would soon vanish away  BUT instead of pursuing a conduct so suitable to blind and erring mortals we find the teachers of Christianity split into a thousand sects and labouring  each  to support by every art and every sophism the particular tenets of his  human  leader  THE followers of Calvin who style themselves the orthodox most unwarrantably presume to circumscribe the goodness of GOD when they confidently affirm that although the sacrifice upon the cross made a satisfaction of value sufficient to ransom a thousand worlds yet that however it was  not  offered for all mankind but  only  for  the  elected few  and that  all  but those  few  were ACCORDING TO THE UNSEARCHABLE COUNSEL OF GOD'S WILL AND FOR THE GLORY OF HIS SOVEREIGN POWER PASSED BY AND ORDAINED TO DISHONOUR AND WRATH  Now that any man who loves his brethren who are upon earth and entertains  just  notions of his Father who is in heaven should believe such doctrines as these is absolutely impossible it is indeed always to be dreaded lest he upon whom in early youth these tenets have been inculcated as the truths of GOD should by the proneness of mankind to run from one extreme to another be led in the maturity of age to deny the efficacy of CHRIST'S death  altogether  and to attempt to bring down that adorable Person from the dignity of the uncreated Redeemer of the world to the level of an ordinary martyr  SUCH was the origin and progress of the person who is at present busied in perverting the faith of these nations He was educated he informs us in the firm persuasion that the horrible opinions which have been enumerated are the doctrine of the  prophets and apostles  and without giving himself the trouble as it should seem to inquire whether these things be really so he has thought proper in order to get rid of what in his riper years he finds it  impossible  to  believe  to abandon the inspiration of the Scriptures and has not scrupled to call St Paul an inconclusive reasoner  BUT if we search the bible from Genesis to the book of St John's Revelation we shall not find any of its inspired writers  presuming  to say what the Almighty  could or could not  have done God's ways are indeed often declared to be  past finding out  but there is enough of  them revealed to satisfy us that they are all founded in infinite wisdom that they all flow from perfect goodness that he who made us is  no respecter of persons  that he will have  all  men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth and that he commendeth his love towards us in that  while were yet sinners CHRIST died for us  The evangelical prophet teaches that  the soul of the Messiah was made an offering for sin that he was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquity that the chastisement of our peace was upon him and that by his stripes we are healed  And the great instrument of the world's conversion informs us  that GOD even our Father hath loved us and given us everlasting consolation through grace that CHRIST also hath loved us and given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice unto GOD for a sweet smelling favour  and St Peter adds that  there is none  other  name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved  Neither Prophets nor Apostles presume to limit this great and glorious and ON GOD'S PART THIS FINISHED salvation to a  chosen  few on the contrary we are expressly taught that our Redeemer  gave himself a ransom for  all  that he was made a little lower than the angels that by the grace of GOD he should taste of death for  every man  that the LORD is long suffering towards us not willing that any should perish but that  all  should come to repentance  In the volume of inspiration we learn concerning the blessed Friend of sinners  that in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily  and this is a faithful saying intended to exhilarate alike the hearts of all  Adam's sons that CHRIST  promised  JESUS  exhibited  came into the world to save sinners  without any exception whatever    whether of persons or cases  SUCH being the infinite love of GOD to mankind in CHRIST JESUS we cannot wonder that when first manifested to the world it produced its proper effects that it put an end to all selfishness and division and indeed under the real influence and full belief of this great mystery of divine love there seems to be no room left for any thing else amongst Christians but returns of love to GOD and emanations of love towards one another  CHRISTIANITY one would think needs but to be  fairly  stated in order to its being found worthy of universal acceptation as an act of grace sealed with the royal signet of heaven proposing and providing the  Second  Adam as a second parent or proxy for lapsed mankind immediately when the  first  Adam had without our consent forfeited the inestimable privilege of a glorious immortality Our holy religion when attentively considered in this true point of light will ever be found equally comfortable delightful and interesting to men of all descriptions every individual of which is on the Christian plan readmitted to the same covenant of grace with GOD that Adam himself enjoyed in paradise  PERSONS who meditate with frequency and attention upon these glad tidings will not fail to experience their efficacy to fill agreeably the vacuity of human life When our spirits droop these truths of GOD will chear them When the stings of conscience torment us if we be truly penitent  they  will dispel our fears confirm and augment our hopes disarm the king of terrors and will open a joyous prospect beyond the grave into the heavenly  Canaan and the new Jerusalem in which city of our reconciled Father there are mansions many mansions for receiving them  who through faith and patient continuance in welldoing seek for glory and immortality  THE plain and numerous declarations of holy writ on this subject militate so forcibly against the Calvinist who denies the  universality  of CHRIST'S satisfaction as well as against the Socinian who denies that satisfaction  altogether  that it would be astonishing how either of those sects should have gained ground in the world did not daily experience evince that mankind are more ready to torture every thing into an agreement with their own preconceived opinions than to try the truth of those opinions by the word of GOD  BUT if CHRIST died for  all  men why it may be asked have we not reason to expect that  all  men shall be  saved  Is it not detracting from the merits of the great sacrifice of this day to suppose that it was offered for any  one  person who shall not  ultimately  reap all the  benefits  which it was intended to purchase By no means The obstinate rejection of CHRIST'S gospel by an incorrigible sinner may make  him miserable  but the rejection cannot detract either from the  mercy  of the Father or from the  merits  of the Son There have been instances and amongst our own fellow subjects and in the passing century of men redeemed from slavery who have yet refused to quit the place of their captivity and who  defeated  though surely without  lessening  the beneficence of him who paid their stipulated ransom It is even so with us The full price of our redemption from sin and Satan has been paid but if we  refuse  to  change  our  masters if we  will  not  accept  the glorious liberty of the sons of GOD when offered to us  without money and without price  our ruin must be imputed to ourselves and not to our  merciful Creator  who desires not the misery of his creatures nor to our adorable Redeemer  who gave his life a ransom for all  THE first great purpose for which CHRIST died was to pay the penalty of our first parent's transgression to rescue us from the everlasting power of the grave and to put us anew into a capacity of obtaining and of relishing that happiness in the  next  world which is to be considered as in some sort the  natural  effect of holiness in  this  CHRIST our passover by his own oblation of himself once offered hath without any cooperation of ours completed this mighty work for  as in Adam all die even so in CHRIST shall  all  even the  wicked  as well as the  righteous  be made  alive    but  observe  the righteous only shall rise to happiness  OUR blessed LORD suffered to redeem us from death and to purchase for us the grace of the gospel covenant but it was no part of  his  design nor is it any part of  that  covenant to cancel the eternal obligations of  piety and virtue These  were in force before man fellthey are equally in force now that he is redeemed and by them shall we be tried at that great day for which all other days were made For tribulation and anguish saith the book of truth must be  the portion of every soul of man that doth evil of the Jew first and also of the Gentile  SUCH is the nature of the redemption wrought by CHRIST such the gracious terms of that covenant of mercy which by his precious bloodshedding he hath obtained  for us This is  all  that is expressly revealed concerning it and it is  all  that we are required to  believe  FROM the disproportion between a finite and an infinite mind it seems improbable that even in heaven itself the  one  should ever be in circumstances to judge of  all  the proceedings of  the other  because a  certain  judgment of the justice and goodness of GOD any more than of  any other  governor cannot be formed from a  partial  view of his dispensations  CHRIST really was  all  that the Mosaic ritual exhibited in types and instead of having been a sacrifice  only  in figure all the sacrifices which preceded him were merely figurative of Him  CHRIST is stiled our PassoverHe is said to have been sacrificed for us and we may reasonably conclude that without a  necessity  for such a process it would never have existed Now if CHRIST is  our  Passover  His  blood must do for us what the blood of the paschal lamb did for the Hebrews in Egypt but that blood was  expiatory  and therefore so is  Christ's  BELIEVE not then I pray you  assertions  however confident that such an atonement was  altogether needless  and that therefore the passages of scripture which seem to teach it are nothing more than  metaphorical expressions  But rather reflect that you are taught by unerring wisdom concerning the redemption of your souls that it is a mystery into which even the  angels  who surely knew more of the divine counsels than the most acute Socinian on earth  desire to look  and do not  fully comprehend  and therefore  we  may well rest contented with the plain though narrow view of it which is laid before us  Prying  into this mystery like gazing on the sun begins in  pain  and ends in  blindness  IT must surely be granted that forgiveness of sin on account of the vicarious sufferings of our blessed LORD is indeed a method admirably calculated at once to repress presumption to discourage men from repeating their transgressions to give them a deep sense of the odiousness of sin and to convince them of the excellency of the divine laws and the indispensable necessity of paying a willing obedience to them  IN this dispensation  mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other  and whilst a guilty world was received into the divine favour the most awful warning was held out to  that  worldand indeed to the whole intelligent creation which it was possible even for  Omnipotence itself  to  give  IF after having seen our Saviour in the garden deprecating in vain that fearful cup which  we  had  deserved  if after having beheld him hanging on the cross and heard him in the agony of his soul crying out  MY GOD MY GOD why hast thou forsaken me  If after all this we can still continue  unmoved  it does not appear probable that we should be persuaded to forsake our sins and follow our Saviour by a prospect either of the joyful effects of piety or the miserable consequences of guilt and how in the name of common sense can we hope to  escape wretchedness in the extreme if we neglect so great salvation  WHAT then remains but that in the strength of our everblessed Redeemer we  cast away from us all our transgressions whereby we have transgressed and make us a new heart and a new spirit  that so we may on the approaching festival receive the holy communion  of the body and blood of our Saviour CHRIST with a full trust in GOD'S mercy and with a quiet conscience  WHAT  Our  repentance  is weak and unworthy and fit to be  repented  of and all our  righteousness  is as  filthy rags  How then dare we appear in the presence of GOD there is nothing before us but  condemnation  there is nothing in ourselves whence any  comfort  or  assurance  can arise all is  darkness  But as the  serpent  was lifted up in the wilderness so ought we to look by  faith  unto our great  Highpriest  who was lifted up upon the cross for us  that whoever  believeth  in him should have  eternal life    and although our  faith  be weak yet for our comfort be it remembered the  virtue  is not in our faith which is merely the  band  that reaches the medicine to us The whole  virtue  is in the  medicine  in the allsufficient satisfaction which EMANUEL has made for us in his own  person  wholly without us though applied inwardly by  faith  which itself is also the gift of GOD  remains but that we should this day  return unto the LORD our GOD for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and repents him of the evil  WE believe Lord help thou our unbelief Father we have sinned against heaven and before thee and are no more worthy to be called thy sons But thou art the same Lord whose property is always to have mercy and to forgive grant us therefore gracious Lord whensoever we approach thy holy table  so  to eat the flesh of thy dear Son JESUS CHRIST and to drink his blood that our sinful bodies may be made clean by his body and our souls washed through his most precious blood and that we may evermore dwell in him and he in us  Now unto GOD that loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation through graceunto the holy and undivided Trinityto Father Son and Holy Ghost be ascribed equal honour by the church militant on earth and triumphant in heaven  FINIS
