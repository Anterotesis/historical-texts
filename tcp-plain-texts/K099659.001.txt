 ANALECTS IN VERSE AND PROSE CHIEFLY DRAMATICAL SATIRICAL AND PASTORAL  VOL I  LONDON PRINTED FOR P SHATWELL OPPOSITE DURHAMYARD IN THE STRAND J DODSLEY PALLMALL AND T DAVIES RUSSELSTREET COVENTGARDEN MDCCLXX  TO CHARLES DUNSTER ESQ OF ORIEL COLLEGE OXFORD  DEAR SIR  THE indefatigable means you took to convince me of your friendship by promoting the following trifles made me take the liberty of inscribing them to you for indeed I had scarce hinted my intention when you took the earliest opportunity of procuring those essentials which have proved the means of my bringing them to light I am perfectly convinced that you have humanity enough to overlook the too many imperfections  you will meet with if you shou'd have patience enough to read my little Analects for from my connections in business and the  attention  that I am from an innate affection oblig'd to pay my fireside have made me in some measure more  inattentive  than I should have been I have inserted many I could have wish'd to erase because I had not time to finish many pieces which I had begun and indeed I was out in my calculation in what would furnish a couple of volumes but yet determined not to extend it in appearance I mean not as is generally done on these occasions to give much paper and little printing I often wish'd to have found you at my elbow when I have sent a proof to press that you might have given a polish to the many rude and uncultivated passages I am afraid you will stammer atHowever I shall trust to your candour and good sense to make such allowances as you shall think necessary and when I see you I am sure you will shew so much the gentleman as to  whisper  my errors to me that no assiduous critic may know there is a fault through you when he has not capacity enough to find it out himselfBut this is rather unnecessary as I am so circumstantially  convinced of your friendship and esteem for I always perceived on those occasions that you seemed happy rather to throw a veil over an error in your friend than expose it to the greedy ear of envy for the sake of selfostentation or the elevating plaudits of a select society  I was once in hopes that the  Nutbrown Maid  would have made its appearance on the the stage but Mr GARRICK gave me so many sufficient reasons why it would not do not altogether divesting it of merit that I resign'd my hopes with pleasure knowing from the many material marks of friendship I have experienced from that gentleman if it had been perfectly calculated he would have given it the fairest chance in his power therefore I printed it hoping it might afford some little entertainment in the closet You was pleased some time ago to send me a few corrections you had made in what I had given you to look over but by some accident or other I had the misfortune to lose them which was of no little concern to me as what they were have escaped my remembrance so that at least I am convinced you will meet with the same errors  again whence I thought it necessary to give you some reason why I have not adhered to your amendments but if ever a future opportunity should offer on the like occasion I will endeavour to be more careful  SIR  I am with the greatest respect and sincerity your most obliged and humble servant GEORGE SAVILLE CAREY  CONTENTS TO VOL I  THE NutBrown Maid an Opera of three Acts Page  Momus a Criticism on the Performers

SCENE I  A Grove with a prospect behind of a fine rural country  Emma  disguised as a Sheperdess sitting on a green bank under a tree the curtain drawing up with soft music and  Emma  sings as she sits on the back of the stage  Emma  YE secret shades ye verdant plains  Where peace her gentle sway maintains  Whilst round her fair and tranquil throne  No sighs are heard no tears are shown  But love and sweet content are seen  And ev'ry face appears serene  O let a maiden join thy train  'Till happy with her banish'd swain  SCENE II  Enter  Allan  and  Robin  listening to her singing  Allan  She is somewhere here about I'm sure  Robin  And yonder she sits  Allan  'Slife and so she does and a charming lass she isEgad I'll to her  Robin  Hold man perhaps 'tis a fairy  Allan  If she be I don't care I must change a word or two be what she will  Robin  You may if you please for I go no further    Emma  sees them and comes forward  Allan  She's flesh and blood I see by her steps he that would run away from such a fairy ought never to see such anotherpray pretty maid are you marriedhey not speakhum I dad she's sulky methinkswhat may she want nowhum an husband I warrant or perhaps she has got one and wants to be rid of 'm  Robin  That is to say she is either married against her will or 'tis against her will she is not married  Allan  Pray young woman be'ant you well  Emma  No indeed yet I should be much better if you would do me one favour  Robin and Allen  Aye that we will any thing you shall say  Emma  But you will be sure both of you to keep your words  Allan  Never doubt it sweetheart never doubt it  Emma  Then you cannot do any thing that will please me more than to take yourselves away  Robin  Oh oh she can speak you find  Allan  Wounds she's 'stound me  Emma  Why are ye not gone  Robin  Aye aye come along troth if you don't I'll tell Sue  Allan  I don't care for that neither I must break my word for once  SONG  Say say what you will  I'll tarry here still  My heart is entrapp'd in a snare  Go go and tell  Sue  You've nought else to do  But stay here I will I declare  Emma  Aye prithee do and you'll do well  Allan  Edad then I'll follow go where you will my lass  Emma  You had better go follow the plough  Allan  Nay nay now thou dost'nt think so I am sure come let us be better acquainted  Emma  Prithee clod begone for thou'lt make thyself as hateful to me as thou art troublesome  SONG  Hence away thou hateful clown  Thou silly blockhead hence  Go seek some bumkin of thy own  Like thee unknown to sense  Exit  SCENE III  Allan  and  Robin  manet  Allan  Who could have thought so pretty a creature could have been in such a passion  Robin  Aye she's a trimmer I warrant ye there's many a fair face with a foul tongue they say you had better stick to poor Sue if she knew you was here she would be breaking her heart I suppose  Allan  There's no harm man in having two  strings to one's bow for when one is too full of her airs I like to have another to fly to  Robin  And yet you are mightily mift too when Sue happens to smile at any body but yourself  Huntsmen and horns heard at a distance  Allan  Hark the hounds  Robin  I' dad so there are  hollows  hoick hoick hoick hoo hoo by George I'll be one in the chace  Allan  So you may if you will but I'll have a chace of my own I'll after yon pretty fac'd puss  Robin  An you do I'll tell Susan mark that my lad  Exeunt  Robin  and  Allan  SCENE IV  An open Plain  Enter  Henry  in a hunter's dress singing  What station on earth such true pleasures can yield  As love in the grove or the stag in the field  When fatigu'd with the chace in the grove we repose  And Dian her tribute to Cupid bestows  Now to sair Emma who knows not who I am but believes me to be a banished man I have  play'd upon her in disguise and in a peasant's garb made more advancements in her good esteem than the gayest knight or fopling of the court with all the glaring outside of success who woo but with their cloaths  An hollowing heard without  But yonder come some gentlemen of the hunt proclaiming by their shouts the pleasures of a wellspent day  SCENE V  Enter Huntsmen c  Joy to ye gentlemen the sport has been successful  st Huntsman  Thanks to you Sir  d Huntsman  I think I never saw so fine a chace there has been much danger too  Henry  The more the danger greater still the sport I saw a rustic scouring yonder cliff and being eager in pursuit unluckily he tript and tumbled headlong down but fortunately for him he was received by the friendly stream below which broke his fall that otherwise must have broke his neck  Both Huntsmen  Ha ha ha poor fellow  st Huntsman  If he had happened to have been in love such a tumble might have cured himBut come my appetite is keen I linger for refreshment let's towards home  d Huntsman  Your company will be a pleasure to us Sir if you are disposed this way  Henry  Sir my disposition is to comply with every kind entreaty the day is on the decline and I am far from home my horse is at a cottage near at handthis is my way and should have been right glad if chance had made it your's  st Huntsman  Then take good care you meet not with a witch  Henry  A witch  d Huntsman  Aye but a lovely one with many charms and witches deal in charms you know  SONG  Take care good Sir how you pass  There's danger I assure you  Shou'd you meet the pretty lass  Perhaps she may allure you  There is witchcraft in each eye  No mortal can resist 'em  Pouting lips of coral die  Oh how I could have kist 'em  Henry  I do not understand you enchantment and witchcraft what may you mean  st Huntsman  Why Sir I'll tell you as we came along the skirts of this wood a lovely damsel wrapt in thought was walking to and fro beneath the shade now and then she'd press her hand against her breast then with eyes full of loveliness and tears she'd look around sigh as if her gentle heart would break and of a sudden cry Oh wretched me  Henry  Of what appearance pray  d Huntsman  She wore the habit of a shepherdess We entreated the cause of her distress but she rebuked us for our pains with such a modest grace that we retired  Henry  Poor girl a love affair perhaps  st Huntsman  I fancy so  d Huntsman  I wish I had been the happy object I'd have given my fortune for her love  Henry  Then you might have had it I dare say  st Huntsman  I imagine if we had persevered a little patience might have brought her to our purpose  Henry  Not if she be really in love reason  will argue ineffectually when love is rooted in the heart  SONG  Reason to love is urg'd in vain  No force can break his silken chain  He reigns without controul  Unseen the God directs his dart  But soon we feel th' envenom'd smart  Lie rankling in the soul  d Huntsman  Then we'll think no more of her so good day to you Sir I'll go and make love to a sirloin and a bowl of punch and I warrant I make 'em submit  Exeunt Huntsmen singing one way and  Henry  the other  SCENE VI  A Grove  Emma  disconsolate  Emma  I seek alas in vain Oh my Henry where art thou hid perhaps he's happy with my rival now sure there's no pain like love What shall I do I've lost my way fatigu'd and faint in a doubtful search hold if I my mistake not there's a village in my view I'll even thence and seek refreshment there  SCENE VII  Enter  Allan  Allan  You see I've overte'en you sweetheart I told you I would follow you  Emma  Was ever maid so wretched I had no sooner promised myself a comfort but I am interrupted by a fool  Allan  What be'ant you well yet  Emma  Good clown leave me  Allan  Clown forsooth clown  aside  I I I am not a clown sweetheart  Emma  Then you're as simple  Allan  If you was a little better acquainted with me you would not say so  Emma  I am sure of it already What would you have Why do you follow me so  Allan  Why I cannot help it because I love you  Emma  And for that I must fall in love with thee too being the most frightful of thy sex if that don't rid me of him I shall begin to pity him lest he should feel on my account what I for Henry feel  Aside  Allan  Ah I don't mind that tho' you  don't think so I'm sure you pretty lasses like a deal of courting  SONG  You frown and look shy  But I know not for why  'Tis only to try if I love  Should I go away  I know you'd cry stay  Ods niggars but I'll never move  I know very well  If you love you wont tell  But smother with art your desire  You may call me a fool  And seem to be cool  When your pretty dear heart is on fire  Enter  Henry  unseen  Henry  As I live 'tis my Emma in disguise 'Sdeath but why is this rustic with her Is it for him she came or me I'll know She shall not see me yet I will first turn myself to a wizzard concealed in that I'll sift the secret out  Exit  Emma  Pray good fellow leave me if thou dost love me I'm sorry for't from my soul since my heart is another's it is not in my power to  love I would be thy friend in any thing else but let me beg of thee never to mention love to me again  Allan  O but I will I know you can't help loving when you are a little better acquainted with me for I have often heard my granny say that two chumps that had been a good many years together in our house fell in love with one another and it was a hard matter to part them  Emma  That is to say should I be as great a log as thyself I must of course fall in love with thee if there were nobody else in the world  Allan  Hey how's that You puzzle me there too I don't know what to make of that saying I never heard of it before in all my born days Will you say it again I'll guess at it better I dad she talks better than Sue she'll be too much for me if I don't take care  Aside  Emma  This looby teazes me to death would to Heaven I could get rid of him his obstinacy makes me begin to fear him I am perplexed when I think what I have done I dare not go home and if I stay here I shall be  ruined and suspected O my Henry thy Emma's lost a wanderer forlorn  SONG  O could my voice but reach thine ears  Didst thou but see these falling tears  Thou woulst not let me here complain  Or drop one single tear in vain  Some friendly guardian lend me aid  Direct a poor bewilder'd maid  Tell me O tell me if you can  Where I shall find my banish'd man  Allan  I dad thou'rt a main good singer if thou sing'st much more in that strain it will bewitch me Sue cannot sing half so well she can sing nothing but  sings  As I trudg'd out one morning to Derrydown dale  To eat a hot cake and to drink some good ale  I met with a maiden whose cheeks were as red  As a sweet damask rose or a strawberry bed  I learnt her to sing it tho' by the bye can you sing it 'Tis a good merry song if you knew it  Emma  Pray thee go sing by thyself I am not disposed for mirth just now take thyself  away good fellow and some other time I may listen to thee  Allan  Why that's kind too but where shall I see you another time  Emma  Why here perhaps or hereabout  Allan  But what will you give me for remembrance  Emma  Any thing you shall ask that is in my power  Allan  Done with you done with you give me a kiss'tis a fair bargain  Emma  What shall I do I believe I must hold him my hand to get rid of him Why if thou wilt promise to go away directly thou shalt kiss my hand  Enter  Henry  in a conjurer's dress seeing  Allan  kiss  Emma  's hand  Henry  Torture what do I see Is it possible  Emma  Heavens Who is this  Seeing  Henry  Allan  The devil I believehe's ugly enoughdon't be afraidhe shan't hurt thee  Henry  Ye gentle pair fly not from me be  happy I'll retire again rather than disturb you for lovers like to be by themselves  Allan  Why that's true enough old one you are right there I warrant you have been in love in your time  Henry  I have and feel the pangs of it to this day  Allan  Poor soul poor soul  Henry  Fair one I have something to impart to thee in private and what concerns thee nearly  Allan  No no don't hear him he's a wizzard come away sweetheart come away  Henry  Clodpole hold thy peace  Allan  Don't call me clodpole an you do I'll give you a clout  Henry  Fair maid will you answer me one question  Emma  Alas I know not what to say  Henry  Tell me then do you not seek a banished man  Emma  Heavens be witness I do indeed  Henry  Would intelligence on that head be welcome to thee  Emma  My heart my eyes my ears are open to receive it speakspeak of him forever  Allan  Plague on's ugly face I say I don't like 'im he's bewitched the pretty creature already  Henry  As what I'm going to say requires secrecy I must beg this swain to retire a while 'till I have related my story but if your affections are so strongly rooted that you cannot bear a moment's separation I will withdraw and let it die with me  Emma  No rather talk forever if Henry be thy theme if thy story be retarded by this fellow's presence would to Heaven I had a giant's strength that I might spurn him from my sight for like an hateful insect has he teazed me 'till I sickened with impatience and disgust  Robin within  Hola Sue Sue here my lass here they are  Emma  More interruptions perplexing fates  Allan  Hey dey what Sue  speaks in a fright  O the devil take this wizzard I say this is some of his doing I suppose Sue would never have come I'm sure if he had not conjured her she never could have found me if the devil had not had a hand in it  Aside  Enter  Robin  Robin  So master Allan we have found you in the devil's company too I believe at last  seeing  Henry    What do you call him when he's ready  Allan  A wizzard of the woods if you like I believe in my heart he has bewitched this sweet creature here  Robin  And here comes one that you have bewitched I'm afraid  Enter  Sue  in a passion and in tears  SONG  Sue  Alas alas I see 'tis true  O Allan you've deceiv'd your Sue  With your promises so civil  O you sly bewitching devil  I could tear myself to pieces  My fear and jealousy encreases  I'll go and hang me on yon willow  And when dead I'll haunt thy pillow  Thou ne'er shalt find a maid so true  As poor deceiv'd distracted Sue  Allan  Nay but Sue now Sue don't go to frighten one who the devil put all this in thy head Don't be jealous girl don't be jealous  Sue  Don't you give me cause then you falsehearted deceitful cruel creature Jealous how would you like to have been serv'd so Did not you threaten to hang yourself last night if I ever let Ralph kiss me again And now you have been raking the duce knows where after the devil knows who all day long  Robin  Well said Sue give it him ha ha ha I dad this is the best sport I have seen some time  Allan  Nay you should not blame me for being a little waggish Did not you say you lov'd a rake to your heart Why I have done no harm  Sue  I am sure you can't have been doing any good when you have been in the woods all day with such a wanton looking hussey as that is I wish she was in the house of correction a straggling rambling minx  Emma  Alas I am undone  Sue  There there she says she is undone  Allan  But not by me I have not done it  Emma  Creature cease thy infamy and take thy looby and thyself away  SONG  Ye reptiles earthworms fly this place  Ye refuse of the human race  I will no more your scandal bare  Whilst thus I'm rack'd 'tween hope and fear  For O I've lost the dearest swain  That ever trod the verdant plain  Ye cruel ministers of woe  Why do you rack a maiden so  Sue  There do but hear her now she is crying because she thinks she has lost you O the hypocrite 'twill break my heart I'll never believe but there has been something between you  Robin  Well done Sue  Allan  Why you're mistaken now there has been nothing butbutbut  Sue  But what Oh mercy upon me he is afraid to say what  Allan  Nothing but words  Robin  Oh if there has been nothing between  them but words they must have been very close together indeed Sue  Henry  I can hear no more of this if you don't all instantly leave this place I will rivet you in a tree or turn you all to stone I'll cramp your limbs with my magic power 'till ye shall beg to die  Robin  O the devil take all the wizzards I say  Henry  What say you so again and I'll encircle you with toads and addersawaybegone  Robin  Lud have mercy upon us Pray don't and I'll away directly Well done Sue  Sue runs off in a fright  Come come Allan you don't know who you have got in company with  Allan  If I don't acquaint his worship I'll be hang'd mind that Mr Conjurer    Allan Robin  and  Sue  Exeunt  Henry  Now maiden fair to my story  Emma  I'm all attention  Henry  Alas to be further plunged into affliction I fear you are in love if so I am sorry for you indeed and if Henry be the object of your affections I'd have you cease to love and fix on some one more deserving He  is a reveller an outlaw and in my opinion will come to some unseemly end  Emma  Ah me when shall I meet a comfort more  Henry  Never in him I fear Henry is betrothed to many but is false to all he makes it his study to deceive your sex and boasts of it when done  Emma  Still must I love him O my heart alas 'tis breaking Henry Oh my Henry  She faints  Henry  O matchless girl I have kill'd thee I'm afraid Curse on my cruelty I have made too severe a trial of her taintless loveHold she revives thanks to the fates who are kinder to me than I deserveWhat shall I do If I discover myself to her now the sudden transition of grief to joy may kill her quite Sweet maid take comfort  Emma  Where is comfort to be found if my Henry be false  Henry  I am his friend and will be your's I never failed in my persuasions whenever I wanted to work him to my purpose and indeed I have given him a worse name than he deserves Why he is so great a changeling he  believes all women to be more fickle than himself this I've often heard him say adding too that if he could once find out a maid constant and sincere in her affections to a proof he would take her to his heart forever I'll to him and convince him of your sincere regard and matchless love  Emma  O take me with thee too  Henry  That would marr all leave it to me I will hazard my life in the success  SONG  Take comfort thou deserving maid  Thy matchless truth shall be repaid  Thy Henry swift as thought shall fly  And cheer thy loveafflicted eye  Em  O may thy friendly speech succeed  Then wilt thou make me blest indeed  And if I e'er ungrateful prove  May heaven rob me of my love  Enter Justice  Sightless Allan Robin Sue  Constables Husbandmen c  Justice  Lay hold of him and I'll take care of her I'll see whether your enchantment or my authority be strongest  Henry  Good Sir what do you mean  Justice  O I'll tell you presently you'll turn people into stone and wedge them up in trees will you If you be a wizzard as I'm afraid you are I'll see what I can turn you into    Emma  weeps  Robin  Wounds how grim he looks  SONG  Althof measter wizzard  You growl in your gizzard  It will not one farthing avail  His worship has caught you  Now soon shall be taught you  What conjurers do in a jail  You made Allan untrue  To rosy cheek'd Sue  And fright the poor girl into fits  What you said I declare  Made me wonder and stare  And scar'd me quite out of my wits  Would his worship permit  I do think it more fit  To set the old rogue in a blaze  Tho' hard loaded with chains  He may 'scape all our pains  Since the devil will help him he says  Then let's lead him along  To a stake that is strong  And give him a taste of the fire  There is nothing can thrive  While the wizzard's alive  Then send him at once to his sire  Exeunt omnes  The End of the First Act  ACT II  SCENE I  A room in  Sightless  's house  Enter  Sightless  in his cap and nightgown  SONG  I Crept out of bed and I slipt on my clothes  And I left my old wife in a hearty good doze  I turn'd the key softly and open'd the door  Whilst she most conveniently set up a snore  At other times faith I have thought it uncivil  And wish'd her oft snoring away at the devil  May she snore may she snort may she snort may she snore  May she take such a nap that she never wake more  Sightless  I'm bewitch'd with this wench to be sure for of all the red and white the soft and smooth I never saw her equal she ran in my  head so much all night that I did nothing but dream of her I must feel how her pulse beat I would not send her to prison for fear somebody else might make too free with her troth Odds me here she comes I intended to have had the pleasure of waking her myself but she has prevented me  SCENE II  Enter  Emma  Sight  So sweetheart you're up what did not you sleep well  Emma  I have not slept at all  Sight  Not slept  Emma  Scarce a wink  Sight  Then I'm afraid you have been contriving how to make your escape  Emma  That I never can for I am bound in chains forever  Sight  Bound in chains How how do you mean lass bound in chains Why you talk in your sleep to be sure Where the deuce be your chains I see nothing of 'em  Emma  I feel them tho' but would not break 'em for the world  Sight  Good lackaday she is certainly asleep yet E'dad I'll wake her tho' hallo hallo  Lays hold of her and shakes her  Mrs  Sightless  enters listening  Emma  Bless me Sir what is the matter  Sight  What's the matter child You walk in your sleep  Emma  I rather think that you walk in your sleep who cannot see that I'm awake  Sight  I'dad perhaps I do heyno no I'm not asleep come hussy give me a buss and that will wake me were I dead  SCENE III  Mrs  Sightless  rushes in upon him  Mrs Sightless  Yes I dare say it wou'd you're asleep are you You're asleep and you must come here to be kiss'd awake O you vile  man This is what you had her in the house for This is your conscience is it You would not send her to prison forsooth for fear she might prove innocent and now you have sneak'd out of bed like a falsehearted monster as you are in your sleep on purpose to have this sanctify'd hypocrite wake you with her kisses  Sight  No no my dear you have convinced me that we were both awake with a vengeance I wish you were asleep with all my heart  Mrs Sight  Yes I dare say you do  Sight  Yes and the devil take him that wakes you should you sleep 'till Doomsday  Mrs Sight  O you brute you savage you scandalous goodfornothing creature you but this is all your doing madam Wagtail I'll soon send you a packingHussy I've a good mind to tear your eyes out  Sight  You had better tear your tongue out you jealous pated fool you What a clack you keep indeed  Emma  Madam hear me  Mrs Sight  I won't hear you don't talk to me I shall go mad I believe  Sight  You're mad enough already I think  Mrs Sight  And who may I thank for it but you but I'll be reveng'd  Sight  Why look you wife you are only making a fire for yourself all this time you'll burn yourself up with your own fury I did ask the young woman to kiss me indeed but 'twas only in joke  Mrs Sight  In joke a pretty joke indeed If I had not come in as I did I dare say you'd have made a serious affair of it by this time In joke forsooth A very modest joke I dare say  SONG  Palm not your wanton tricks on me  Your base designs vile man I see  No no I won't despair  Fierce fury in my breast shall rise  What bring your minx before my eyes  This is too much to bear  My vengeance shall you both pursue  I'll do for herI'll do for you  These favours I'll return  Altho' her tender heart shou'd break  The wizard's fate shall she partake  And both together burn  Emma  Madam you may form what opinion you will of your own because time and appearances may have given you some authority for your suspicions nothing but ill manners and a guilty mind can warrant your judging so illiberally of a stranger  Sight  Blessings on her she prattles like an angel  Mrs Sight  Prithee wench don't prate so pertly to me do you know who I am  Emma  Yes madam I am very sensible to whom I'm talking a splenetic  Sight  A what a lunatic mind what you say girl remember she is my wife and therefore claims respect  Emma  I've said nothing but the truth Sir and I shall always pay a greater regard to that than her ungenerous reflections or your authority  Sight  Hey what do you say Do you mean to affront me for my indulgence I must seem to quarrel with her for the sake of peace and quietness or I shall have a dog's life on't else  Aside  Mrs Sight  Aye aye I'm glad on't I'm glad you begin to find her out Innocent yes  she's very innocent to be sure you may see that but as impudent as you please send her to prison I insist on itan impudent stragling hussy  Sight  I believe I must indeed she makes but a bad use of my civility come come you shall go to prison hussy I'll see if I can't make room for you there  Mrs Sight  No no I'll save you that trouble I'll take care to make room for her myself I warrant you  Emma  Alas my resolution tottersarm me with fortitude ye gracious powers nor leave me to despair  SONG  Come  Hope  thou blooming maid appear  Shield O shield me from dispair  Teach me ye gods to undergo  The lovetormenting pangs of woe  And if I die O let me prove  A faithful monument of love  Then then my Henry shalt thou see  Thy Emma kept her words with thee  Mrs Sight  Come come away with you I've something else to do than to hear your whining forsooth  Sight  Aye aye to prison with her I have a key for that lock too I'll have a peep at her there  aside  Ex Omnes  SCENE IV  A Farm House  Enter  Allan Robin  and  Sue  Sue  No no I won't speak to thee I won't look at thee I won't think of thee I won't I won't so I won't  Allan  Nay plague on't Sue don't be hard hearted you know I love you you know I do  Sue  I don't know it nor I won't know it you shan't love me  Robin  Well said Sue don't give out remember the girl in the grove  Allan  Hold thy tongue Robin and don't be a fool  Robin  A fool not I indeed I'm not in love I'm wise enough for that  SONG  The fair or the hrown  A smile or a frown  All ever are equal to me  I laugh and I smile  Love cannot beguile  A heart that is jovial and free  Let fond loving swains  Keep signing their pains  No wench shall my freedom annoy  And yet I am sure  For love there's a cure  Since time will that passion destroy  Sue  to Allen  Don't keep teazing me so don't think I can forget it don't  Allan  Ay but you can forgive it Sue you had always a pure tender heart of your own  Sue  No the duce take me if I do  Robin  No don't Sue make him repent it all the days of his life  Allan  If thee don't hold thy tongue I'll make thee repent it  Robin  Ha ha ha wilt  Allan  Yes I

 You fain now wou'd try  To part Sue and I  But Robin your nonsence won't do  You may giggle and grin  I care not a pin  If Sue will believe that I love  Altho' you impeach  You can't make a breach  Since truth will each falshood remove  Robin  Pshaw pshaw no more of this nonsense Sue what do you think of me hey Come give me a buss and tell me  Sue  Prithee Robin don't play the fool with me  Robin  I play the fool not I indeed prithee don't lay your bargains on me it is you that have play'd the fool I'm afraid I'm sure I'd no hand in't if you have made a slip I can't help it  Allan  You was always a fool  Robin  A fool ha ha ha give me thy hand o'thathow is't brotherif I be a fool I'm sure I must be some relation of your's    Sue  sets up a cry  Robin  Hey to pass what is the matter now  Sue  To say I had made a slip  SONG  I wish I never had seen a man  They're treach'rous as the devil  And like the devil too they can  Be very very civil  O dear O dear what shall I do  I'm sure my heart will burst  You false deceitful wretches you  Of monsiers you're the worst  Exit  Sue Allan  going after her  Robin  lays hold of him and prevents him  Robin  Why you would not be such a fool would you  Allan  Yes but I wou'd  Robin  No no let her come to herself if she won't bear a joke now and then I wou'd not give a rush for her  Allan  'Swounds but I shall have ne'er a sweetheart at this rate  Robin  Pshaw pshaw what a simpleton you are indeed you want sadly to hurry your neck into the noose methinks come come you and I will have a little sport first  SONG  For shou'd you Sue wed  And lead her to bed  No mortal so happy as you  The honeymoon past  You'll find at the last  The wonder will cease to be new  Come come then away  'Tis foolish to stay  With me trudge along to the wake  There's plenty you'll find  To cheer up your mind  And she you like best you may take  Ex  Robin  and Allan  SCENE V  Henry  in Prison  Henry  'Tis high time now to make enquiry after my love I've had a restless night on't this is a trial I never dreamt of if she bears this with fortitude she will be indeed the wonder of her sex and worthy the richest diadem on earth that I love her my heart and soul can witness if after this she talks of love and Henry I shall be convinced that women can be constant and every doubt must fade but who comes here a stranger and a prisoner I suppose perhaps he can inform me where my Emma is disposed  SCENE VI  Enter  Edwin  Edwin  Your pardon Sir I've interceded with the jailor for admittance and shou'd be glad of your consent to exchange a word or two report has made me curious but if it has made me too impertinent I will retire and not offend you  Henry  Sir you do me honour I am glad to see you 'sdeath who can this be his face is most familiar to me  aside  Sir you are welcome  Edwin  I thank you Sir  Henry  Ah me  Edwin  You seem disturbed Sir  Henry  A thought came across the sunshine of my hopes but nowbut now 'tis fair again  Edwin  There is something more than common about this man and a sensible affability that pleases me much  Aside  Henry  You seem to muse Sir I hope you've no design  Edwin  As your suspicions are but natural they do not much surprise me but on my faith I've no design I am a prisoner as yourself and should have been glad had it been your inclination too to have pass'd an heavy hour now and then together and been friends that is all  Henry  You speak Sir like a gentleman and are most welcome I assure you and as you have offered me your friendship you shall find me grateful and sincere I'm grieved to find a man with such a heart in such a situation but come let us be chearful  SONG  Tho' care with heavy hands oppress  And fortune leaves us to distress  Yet shou'd the Gods once condescend  To bless me with a single friend  I wou'd not call the fates unkind  Tho' thus imprison'd and confin'd  Friendship shou'd drive my cares away  And make me hope a better day  Edwin  I have not had so agreeable an interview these twelvemonths  Henry  These twelvemonths I hope you've not been here so long  Edwin  Much longer Sir  Henry  I'm sorry for it your crime surely must be great indeed to incur so long a punishment  Edwin  I think I may venture to say it is more an accident than a crime  Henry  Prisons were not made for the unfortunate but the wicked and abandon'd may I presume to enquire the cause perhaps I may have it in my power to be your friend  Edwin  Alas I am afraid not in such a case my father's death was all the cause  Henry  Imprison'd for your father's death Shall I intreat your name perhaps I am too bold  Edwin  My name Sir is Edwin I was born at Philodale  Henry  At Philodale as I live my old schoolfellow and my sister's lover how fortunate  aside  but I cannot understand Sir how your father's death could be the cause of your imprisonment  Edwin  When he died he left a person in this neighbourhood his executor Sightless who  you must have seen but tho' he bears the name of Justice he is I am afraid as great a stranger to her rules as he is to pity He ever pretended that my father died involved and as I could not contradict it was forc'd to think so too this was a sad shock tho' the least of my affliction for I was betroth'd to the lovliest maid whose fortune was almost equal to her beauty but alas becoming destitute and poor cou'd never think of seeing her again and wrote her word I meant to pass the seas never to return  Henry  O most distressing tale but pray go on  Edwin  Before my father died having an occasion for a certain sum previous to his knowledge which I had scarcely hinted to his worship but he begged he might oblige me I thought it kindness and gladly embraced the opportunity I gave my note with promise of a double interest but ere the best of fathers had closed his eyes and my time for the payment of the debt unfortunately expir'd he hurry'd me to prison where I have been a sad and melancholy being ever since I wou'd have wrote to certain friends but he has cruelly deprived me  of that advantage by giving the jailor the strictest charge never to place a pen and ink within my reach or let one letter pass the door which action has often made me think he's play'd me foul  Henry  No doubt Sir O the villain come my worthy friend do not dispair I have a charm about me that shall extricate us both if you dare venture to assist I'll prove your friend I have a stratagem on foot by which you'll find I ll make a fair example of his worship and you shall be reveng'd and if they refuse us liberty here is a key that will unlock the strongest bolt  Edwin  Then you may command me and depend on my integrity I shall not dread the consequence or danger since if we fail they cannot make us greater prisoners than we are if they take my life 'twill be a charity  Henry  If I don't preserve both life and liberty I'll resign my own I want to be your friend  Edwin  And I want liberty propose your plan I long to be in action  SONG  Who would not die  For liberty  What wretch would bear to live a slave  And fear the cord the rack or grave  I will not bear  Nor guiltless wear  The cruel chains of infamy  No no I'd sooner die  Henry  Then to the point you have heard no doubt on what suspicion I was committed the superstition of the rusticks has possest 'em meerly from my appearance that I deal in witchcraft  Edwin  'Twas that report that first excited me to visit you  Henry  When I found they first suspected it I endeavoured to make 'em believe that I really did by threat'ning them in the most romantic phrasesBut I may depend on your integrity you say  Edwin  You may Sir on the forfeit of my life  Henry  Then that you may not be deceived I am not what I seem  Edwin  Indeed I did suspect it  Henry  No more on that head at present but why I bear this character you shall know hereafter be satisfied you shall not remain a prisoner here another day were I to declare myself they wou'd gladly give me liberty yet as I have a reason for this strange project I will go thro' it  Edwin  You transport me with pleasure and astonishment  Henry  What most concerns me is there was a fair one in my company whom they have imprison'd too without the smallest circumstance of guilt only that she was with me  Edwin  There was the most lovely maid I ever saw brought this morning to the prison  Henry  This morning  Edwin  Scarce an hour since  Henry  That's strange has she not been here all night  Edwin  I can assure you no Sightless and his wife brought her this morning and when his worship left the prison he gave the strictest orders to the jailor that none shou'd see her but himself which made me pity her indeed  Henry  You amaze me 'Sdeath but this  disturbs me could not one speak with the jailor  Edwin  Most certainly I'll call him hither if you please  Henry  Sir you'll much oblige me if you wou'd    Edwin  goes off the stage and calls the jailor and reenters immediately  Henry  Don't you think he might be prevailed upon to let us see her  Edwin  I doubt it much such men as him are generally strangers to humanity and seldom will be moved to a good action by any thing but a bribe  Henry  That he shall have with all my heart  Edwin  Here he comes  SCENE VII  Enter  Jailor  Jailor  'Swounds master Edwin you call with as much authority as his worship What the plague is the matter with you I thought  you had been hanging yourself and was calling me to cut you down  Edwin  That is very probable to be sure  Jailor  Why I wou'd have done it for you to be sure for my own sake  Edwin  How for your own sake what interest cou'd you have in that  Jailor  What why your carcase and your cloaths the one I shou'd have got a trifle for from the surgeons and the others I wou'd have sold to the ragshop  Henry  What a savage Faith my friend you seem to have a good notion  Jailor  Aye han't I master  Henry  Nobody a betterMethinks you and I shall agree very well  Jailor  I don't know that tho'  Henry  I dare say we shall could you let me change a word or two with the young woman you had brought into prison this morning  Jailor  NoYou speak with her hey What should such an old codger as you want with a young woman no no it won't do it won't do  Henry  Will this do  shews him money  Jailor  Hey why as you sayI don't know  but it may they are pretty looking fellows enough seemingly  Henry  Are they not I thought you and I shou'd agree I'm an excellent physician you see I know the strength of your constitution better than yourself you find  Jailor  Why aye you carry a pleasant kind of physic about you few make a wry face at it I fancy  Henry  Don't I Well what do you say shall we agree  Jailor  I don't know what to say to it i'faith I'm almost afraid  Henry  Pshaw man what shou'd you fear  SONG  Pray who can say you are to blame  Since all your betters do the same  My lord makes harvest of his place  Then prithee where's the great disgrace  The crime is sure not worse in you  Shou'd you pursue the maxim too  For greater knaves at any hour  Will for a bribe restrain their power  Jailor  Faith dad I like your notion you seem to be a good hearty cock give me your hand you'll not blow me I hope you understand me  Henry  No upon my honour  Jailor  Why then 'tis agreed  Henry  Then take your reward and shew us the way come my worthy friend you must bear me company  Jailor  You don't take him with you I hope  meaning  Edwin    Henry  Yes by all means  Jailor  Nay with all my heart tho' by the bye take care his worship don't pop in upon you I expect him here anon he seems to have cast a longing eye upon her himself  Henry  That will be lucky again I shall be there to protect her  aside  O never fear us we'll take care of ourselves  Without  Jailor jailor  Jailor  Coming coming here take the key she is in the best room you know the way master Edwin and so good luck to you  Henry  We thank you  Exit  Henry  and  Edwin    Jailor  Blame me but this is a good dose  'Egad I should like to take such physic every day  Exit Jailor  SCENE VII  Changes to another part of the prison and discovers  Emma  Emma  Surely the fates do mean to counteract all my hopes how perplexing I was enraptured with the highest expectation of seeing my Henry ere this and now he is lost forever wou'd I cou'd see the honest stranger once again perhaps he might inform me where to send to him for did he but know the perilous situation I am in he would surely think of some way to release me Alas should the tidings reach my father's ears I am undone  SONG  Come come my Henry to my aid  Release thy poor distracted maid  For thee these trials do I bear  But O how cruel and severe  SCENE VIII  Henry  and  Edwin  enter in conversation  Henry  You understand me  Edwin  Perfectlybehold the fair one  Henry  O my delight but thou shalt grieve no more I am convinced  Emma  seeing them  Bless me the stranger's here surely he o'erheard my prayers  Henry  Pardon me thou lovely fair one for intruding on you thus for I am more concerned for your misfortune than my own I could not rest 'till I had seen you once again  Emma  Nay you are welcome for you talk'd of Henry  Henry  As we broke off so abruptly in our conversation relating to that youth I have taken this opportunity with your permission to renew it  Emma  O you are kind indeedIs this a friend of Henry's too  Henry  He is  Emma  Then he is most welcome    Edwin  bows  Henry  And is it possible amidst your present perils and calamity you can think so much of Henry  Emma  I think of nothing else  Henry  Then shall he know how much thy truth outrates his highest expectations for tho' I spoke unkindly of his worth I but dissembled he loves with equal warmth and seldom speaks but you he makes his theme he will be transported with your virtue and shall know it  Emma  Know it alas which way  Henry  I have a stratagem on foot for your escape if you will assist me in it I will instantly convey you to your banished man  Emma  I'll risk my life on such a promise  Henry  His worship will be here to visit you anon leave this gentleman and me to manage him and doubt not of success  Emma  May heaven prosper your endeavours  Henry  And hark he comes we'll retire from his sight a while 'till we seize our opportunity    Henry  and  Edwin  retire  Emma  Alas I tremble at the task  SCENE IX  Enter

Reenter  Henry  and  Edwin Henry  in the Justice's cloaths  Henry  Now now my fair one if you'll take your liberty you shall have it in this disguise I can command your discharge  Emma  I'll embrace the opportunity tho' I dread it  Henry  You my good and faithful friend may expect your liberty without delay I'll return and make example of his worship presently  Exit  Henry  and  Emma  at one door

enough Sue and  I forsooth were only trying to make Allan a little jealous or so but her kisses have stuck so close to my lips and her good natured looks I am afraid have bewitched me Now as one may say I find myself over head and ears in love ratt'un I don't know what to make on't I wish I had not meddled with her and yet somehow I don't wish so neither 'edad an I thought she cou'd love me I

give away too old Quickset her father has got a few good pounds by him I warrant me and that is all Allan is in love with in my opinion  SONG  I'm in love lack a day to be sure  I'm afraid I shall find it too true  But where shall I find out a cure  Except from a kiss of dear Sue  How Allan will laugh at me now  I call'd him so often a fool  And yet I can't help it I vow  For I'm pinn'd like a dunce to my stool  'Odds niggins here they come together I'll slip behind this bush and hear what they say  SCENE VIII  Enter  Allan  and  Sue  Allan  Why surely Sue you cannot love Robin if you do

and unkind  To trifle toy and play  When all you've in your mind  Serves only to betray  Robin  Why look you Sue I never lov'd a girl in my life before I confess and shou'd not have lov'd you now in my opinion had I not seen you so often made a fool of by another and always knowing thee to be an honest modest goodnatur'd lass I cou'd not help loving thee somehow  Allan  Will you believe him Sue

cou'd have thought it I'm almost ready to hang myselfIf he marries her I'll make a cuckold of him as sure as he's born  Exit  Allan  SCENE IX  The Prison  Edwin  solus  Edwin  Sure fate has doom'd me to inevitable destruction every effort that I've made to  restore my liberty has unfortunately proved the means of making me still more a prisoner the stranger my fairspoken ally is not yet return'd

I'm likely to be releas'd by death  SONG  Like one benighted and forlorn  No guide to point my way  Who wishes the return of morn  Or Cynthia's silver ray  With fear he steps and looks around  At

that neither it may save me a supper perhaps  aside  Why as you say Madam it is very pleasant to be sure this is a favourite tree of mine I often make it my bench of authority and try my criminals here  Aeth  Beneath this tree  Sight  Aye marry do I this tree was set by a grandfather of mine and has had many a rebel hung upon it since he died and if I shou'd once more meet with this wizard again he shall have the honour of hanging upon it himself and you shall have the pleasure of seeing him if you please I am sure you never saw a greater rogue hang'd in your life and I've got another in prison at present shall keep him company  SONG  I'll hang 'em I'll hang 'em together  And gibbet them both when I've done  To be batter'd about with the weather  And melted away with the sun  I'll hang 'em both here I declare it  With a fatal inscription before 'em  I'd have ev'ry mortal beware it  And dread an high judge of the Quorum  Aeth  Sure you'll not hang him Sir  Sight  Not burn him you mean hang him O yes you may depend upon that  The tabor and pipe heard without  Aeth  What call you these Sir  Sight  Some fool has got himself married I suppose if he has got him as good a wife as mine he had better staid a little longer and have been hang'd with Mr Wizard and Co  Enter  Robin Sue  and others dancing after the tabor and pipe across the stage they pull off their hats as they pass  Away with ye away with ye you had need be merry forsooth I hate to see such a parcel of fools  Aeth  I must confess it gives me infinite pleasure to see them so happy  Sight  Aye but how will they look by and by that's the joke  Aeth  That we cannot tell a good heart ever makes a pleasant eye  Sight  If that be true your ladyship's a good heart of your own for you have a main pleasant eye I can tell you that  Aeth  You've a pleasant tongue of your own to tell me so how true I will not say nor will I thank you for the compliment because that wou'd be accepting of what I don't deserve  Sight  Troth but you do deserve it and  therefore must accept on't and as a rarity too for I seldom give my compliments away without return  Aeth  Then you sell 'em I presume  Sight  No no lack a day not I when I compliment a lady I mean to get a kiss if I can when a man  Aeth  His money I suppose  Sight  Hum ah why sometimes as one may say on some occasions or so faith she's a sweet one and as wise as a judge she'll be too much for me if I don't take carewhat a chance had I here now were I not marriedO plague on that bitter old jade at home I say she's a tough one or the devil wou'd have had her ere now  aside  Aeth  I wonder we have not seen my brother yet  to her attendant  Atten  It is very strange  A noise without  Sight  O here they come here they come now you shall see the very devil himself  Aeth  I shall beg to be excused the sight  Sight  Don't fear madam don't fear I've too much power over his devilship than to let him do so sweet a lady any harm  Aeth  I shall not fear that devil much that is afraid of you  SCENE XI  Enter  Henry  and  Emma  guarded by the  Jailor  c  Sight  So madam Gadabout you have found your way back again but where is the son of old Beelzebub the wizard  Jailor  And please your worship we have not ta'en him yet master Constable and two or three more are after him I suppose they will bring him anon I thought it best to bring young madam back first lest she might give us the slip again  Sight  Right lad right but who have you here  Jailor  One of the wizard's acquaintance I find my lady and he were together  Sight  What is he and where does he come from  Jailor  I don't know and please your worship they were together as I said and when  I talk'd of taking her away he began to abuse me and call'd your worship a fool and an ass  Sight  An ass an impudent rascal I'll ass you sirrah I'll ass you ye villain I will you shall prove me an ass or I'll prove you a goose  Henry  That your worship's an ass needs no proof or a goat rather  Sight  Sirrah sirrah how dare you talk to me in this manner dost know who thou art talking to  Henry  Perfectly well  Sight  Tie him neck and heels an impudent scoundrel and to prison with him  They seize hold of  Henry  Henry  Nay give me leave to strip first    Henry  discovers himself  Henry  Now Sir I'm at your service I was the wizard  Aeth  My brother astonishment  Sight  Lord Henry  Emma  My Henry a lord  Sight  Mercy upon me what will become of me  Henry  Why don't you put your threats in practice Justice where are your ropes and your gibbets methinks your worship cools upon it  what not a word shame on thee well may'st thou stiffen with thy guilt I cou'd forgive thy imprisonment and insolence to me but when I think on thy ungenerous and execrable behaviour to this lady my temper catches fire at the deed and whets me to revenge  Sight  Ah your lordship mercy mercy we are all frail  Henry  But not all villains too I hope like thee nay be ever dumb can there be excuse for thee old and full of sinWhat would have been thy guilt if fortune had not thrown me in the way to avert thy design when like a monster as thou art thou threatenedst to force this fair one to compliance is it possible thou canst form an excuse for such a crime no no tho' her beauty's so divine that saints beholding her might break off their prayers and beg to taste the perfume of her lipsCome come to my heart thou matchless piece of fortitude and love  embraces  with heaven's will and thine we'll part no more  Emma  Nay then let danger threaten as it lists  Aeth  I'm all astonishment and wonder  Henry  O sister take this jewel to thy breast  for she's a paragon of constancy I've tried her truth and like the purest gold have found her speckless she has gone a pilgrimage for me by day and night thro' all the perils of the dreary wild and never faulter'd in a word or thought Here take her Aethelia for she is one you long have wish'd to seebehold the matchless Nutbrown Maid  Aeth  Indeed then you could not have presented me with a maid more welcome  embraces her  Emma  So kind a saying from so fair a friend delights me much  Aeth  Tho' my expectations were other than I've met I'm far more pleas'd in the disappointment  Henry  That's kindly said so generous an acknowledgment deserves a good return nor shall you find me backward to be grateful I'll endeavour to repay tho' what I give may prove unwelcome  Aeth  Where is the need why wou'd you lessen my regard by thinking I have an interest in my love  Henry  Mistake me not I only wish you happy as myself  Aeth  That you know can never be since you are in possession of the dearest object of your heart and mine is lost forever  Emma  Alas I pity you from my soul  Henry  Never despair with his worship's leave I'll take the liberty to send for a gentleman a friend of mine and a most intimate acquaintance of the man you love who I am persuaded can give you some account nay will convince you he still survives and loves you  Aeth  Heavens what do I hear  Henry  What says your worship will you condescend to oblige me  Sight  In any thing your lordship shall please to ask 'sheart I'm glad he's so pleasant 'faith  aside  Henry  Then send this instant for that injured youth whose tale I fain wou'd hear again that you may be a weeping auditor like me  Sight  Who may your lordship mean  Henry  The gentleman that help'd me to escape  Emma  What means my Henry  Aeth  You make me tremble with conjecture pray unfold the mystery and ease me of suspense  Henry  The prisoner shall unriddle all have  patience but a little while and you'll be paid for itYour worship seems to hesitate I've not been us'd to ask a favour twice and therefore must demand him now send for him I say or take his place yourself for the refusal  Sight  Oh I'll send for him to be sure my lordPoor soulJailor go fetch him hither directly  Exit  Jailor    I hope your lordship did not doubt my sending for himOh that I had hang'd him a twelvemonth ago and then he wou'd not have stood in judgment against me now  aside  Henry  How fares my Emma she seems impatientO let no thought but joy intrude upon the best of mindsSister be chearful I'll make you smile before we part you came to see a wizard you'll allow and that you may not be disappointed quite I'll prove myself a conjurer at least  Emma  If one who deals in mysteries be such you are a conjurer indeedO this provoking curiosity but I'm sure it bodes no ill since my Henry is concerned  SONG  No more shall doubts invade my breast  No more thro' woods and wilds I'll roam  For Emma's heart shall be at rest  While Henry's bosom proves it's home  Where late the owl and nightingale  Made night with double gloom appear  There shall my Henry tell his tale  And e'ry grove and valley cheer  Aeth  Alas what can it mean my heart seems conscious of some strange event I'm all surmise and fear  Henry  And here comes one will tell you what it means  Sight  Ah poor soul here he comes  SCENE XII  Enter  Edwin  Aeth  Edwin  Edwin  Aethelia lord Henry  Aeth  From oblivion or the grave return'd  Henry  From oblivion if you please Aethelia but as great a stranger to the grave as you  Emma  Is the gentleman an acquaintance of your sister's then  Henry  He is my love the most intimate one in the world and yet you see they hardly speak to one another  Emma  Alas I pity their confusion  Henry  Edwin thy handthere is Aethelia she is most glad to see thee tho' asham'd to own it yet because her passion is a secret one thou art inclin'd to speak I know but thy misfortunes and appearance I perceive make thee set too light a value on thyself excuse me Edwin I am as much thy friend as ever and am overjoy'd to see thee my sister there is something more than friend and she of course is glad to see thee too I have presum'd to speak your inclinations and flatter myself was pretty near the mark  Edwin  For me my lord you have spoken as if some friendly genius had whisper'd in my ear the dictates of my heart but can Aethelia think on one so poor so sad as I tho' I must  confess the loss of her has been the greatest sorrow that I've felt when barr'd from liberty and light  Aeth  Nay then my every doubt is hush'd nor will I blush to own when 'midst the gayest pageantry of life I felt a sorrow for my Edwin's loss I never cou'd overcome  Edwin  What do I hear Oh I cou'd live upon the sound forever love in spite of fortune and her frowns now makes me bold and in Aethelia's name I feast on bliss eternal  Henry  Now sister I hope you'll own I've a good knack at wizardizing  Edwin  Is it possible you cou'd assume that character so well  Henry  As sure as you are here thro' my enchantment  Emma  What cou'd have been your motive first  Henry  Your beauty was the motive and your matchless constancy has prov'd the great reward and confuted my every doubt of woman's loveO 'tis such extasy of bliss to find the maid I love the fairest of her sex so true so faithful and so kind  SCENE XIII  Enter Mrs  Sightless  Mrs Sight  Where is she a jade an impudent hussy    Sightless  stops her and claps his hand upon her mouth  Sight  'Swounds are you mad don't you see who's before you  Henry  Pray Sir let her go on let us hear what the good lady has to say  Mrs Sight  Nothing  Sight  Nothing is a good answer 'tis the soonest said you know my lord  Henry  I wish I had no more to say to you but in justice to this injured gentleman I must have a further hearing on his account 'till when I shall beg you'll accept his lodgings for yourself a night or two which you have so generously bestow'd on him this twelvemonth past  Mrs Sight  This is all your own doings  I thought what it wou'd come to I'll be hang'd if I did'ntO mercy on me  Sight  My lord your lordshipfor heaven's sake for my wife's sake  Henry  I have no time to hear you now therefore Mr Jailor I beg you'd take care of his worship give him this gentleman's apartments keep the locks fast upon him and on the peril of your own life that you give him liberty 'till you hear from me here is something for encouragement I know you love a bribe  gives him money  Jailor  God bless your honour my lord I hope your honour my lord will not let me be brought into a scrape for it  Henry  Take care of his worship I say and you've nothing to fear  Jailor  Enough said my lord I'll take care of him I warrant youUpon my soul your worship I'm sorry for it but I can't help it you see therefore your worship had better be budging to crib and make the best on't  Mrs Sight  O what distraction is this  cries bitterly  Henry  Away with 'em jailor I'm sick of their company  Jailor  Your worship had better take heart  Sight  O what a pickle I'm in  Exeunt  Sightless Mrs Sightless  and Jailor  Henry  Now naught but pleasure and delight shall crown the coming hours  Edwin  And lo the villagers appear with pipe and tabor see they come this way  Henry  They shall be welcome all come my Edwin the sound of joy shall drive each dull and languid vapour hence whilst Emma the dearest treasure of my heart and mind shall be the burden of each rustic's song  SONG  Hen  Now let ev'ry swain appear  Come come ye maidens far and near  With hearts elate exempt from care  From wake from harvesthome and fair  CHORUS  Then let a pageant wreath be made  To crown the matchless Nutbrown Maid  A month of holidays we'll keep  Each lovesick maid shall cease to weep  No jealous doubts shall e'er infest  A lover's heart or break his rest  CHORUS  Then let a pageant wreath be made  To crown the matchless Nutbrown Maid  MOMUS A POEM  OR A CRITICAL EXAMINATION INTO THE MERITS of the PERFORMERS AND COMIC PIECES AT THE THEATREROYAL in the HAYMARKET  MOMUS  NO more shall Monkey's mimicry engage  No more shall Cats and Dogs usurp the stage  Alluding to Signior Placido's Monkey c    See  Momus'  sons a single unit higher  Divert the town with their detractive fire  While patents royal are to  Merit  thrown  To please Sir  Francis  Sir Francis Blake Delaval  and a tasteless town  See  Foote  the foremost of the mimic race  Amuse the town with scandal and grimace  While private characters each scene adorn  Held up by him to meet the public scorn  Where custom's brought on some peculiar mode  Of speech or air out of the common road  If but deficient in a leg or eye  Or from misfortune chance to look awry  This  maimed  mimick favour'd so by fate  That he might still more truly imitate  With selfvain zeal a stupid laugh to raise  He with a low audacity conveys  His borrow'd puns with a sarcastic face  Join'd by the meanest of the acting race  Without restraint his dearest friends expose  But  Foote  and friendship are eternal foes  Never did folly with such sway maintain  Her seat and with her baby rattle reign  Over  Apollo  and his laurell'd sons  With  glees  and  catches mimicry  and  puns  Like the loud quack in some small country town  Who with his fool entices ev'ry clown  Displays his pranks his filthy nostrums vends  And with a  puff  their quality commends  So  Foote  his own loud brazen trumpet blows  And would like him his trash for wit impose  As wrecks and rubbish follow ev'ry tide  So ev'ry blockhead joins the laughing side  Blest with a face of humour to engage  At once a drooping and a laughing age  Shuter  with some pretensions to a name  Stands forth distinguish'd in the book of fame  The grateful public will for humour take  Whatever blunder he may chance to make  Who fond of laughter oddity and whim  Have fix'd the mask of Comedy on him  With face by  Bacchus  and by  Venus  marr'd  For he with both the mighty powers warr'd  In word expressive and in gesture dry  In action simple with a meaning eye  See  Weston  gravely force the hearty smile  Nor pall with low buffoonery the while  Whene'er in  Sneak  or  Drugger  he appears  Garrick  attends with patient eyes and ears  And owns his humour natural and true  For  Garrick  must give genius her due  See  Dibble Davis  better half the year  A mere poltroona hero how appear  Unnotic'd and obscure he struts unknown  An utter stranger to the injur'd town  'Till  Foote  his patron  impotent  and  wise  At once convinces each beholder's eyes  That merit oft beneath oppression dwells  For see how  Davis  now himself excells  Aimwell Cassio  nay and many more  Such parts were never acted so before  And that my Muse may shew her meaning plain  Hopes ne'er to see 'em murder'd so again  An arrant stroller from the lord knows where  A true itinerant now here now there  Who oft from barn to barn from town to town  Ten nights has labour'd for a single crown  See  Bannister  assume unaw'd by shame  A mimic's vile and despicable name  For  Bannister  a  Wilkinson  would be  But can't so truly imitate as he  To ape the manner of some better play'r  An act ungen'rous at the best unfair  Why should one actor villainously try  To damn another in the public eye  Either by malice or by envy led  To hurt his brother in his fame or bread  When to the world 'tis evidently known  He ne'er could boast a method of his own  Such are a pest and scandal to the stage  And who but  Foote  would any such engage  For all must own the stage was ne'er design'd  To point at this or that but all mankind  E'en devotees must own the stage of use  Where it don't leave  instruction  for  abuse  Led by conceit and fond of stage applause  Yet stands condemn'd if judg'd by acting laws  With face nor voice nor action to commend  Or win one single auditor his friend  See  Sowden  great in capitals appear  Disgust the eye and grate the dullest ear  For he most surely of all human kind  Was ne'er by nature for the stage design'd  Long in  Hibernia  has he trod the field  Where judgment oft to prejudice must yield  And with no small indulgence and regard  Tho' ev'ry night some noble part he marr'd  See him return declining and in age  Riding his only Hobbyhorse the stage  And with a boyish zeal the toy embrace  Tho' time with years has wrinkled o'er his face  Of vulgar accent and of bully's  pink  A rolling sidle with a  knowing wink  Coarse and robust who might perhaps engage  Had he been cast on the  Broughtonian  stage  Palmer  selfconfident attempts to please  In high wrote parts of elegance and ease  But like to him who roll'd the stone in vain  Will ne'er the summit of his hopes attain  Yet must we own him some small share of praise  When  Bruin Loader  and such parts he plays  He's sure to please while in this line he steers  For in such parts he still  himself  appears  Then let him ever in that track remain  Where he is sure some small applause to gain  And never more in gentlemen and beaux  Disgrace the stage the author and the cloaths  Barry  each season might delight the town  But that we've better actors of our own  Yet think not  Barry  that I will disgrace  Or mean to herd him with the common race  He is an  Actor  ev'ry judge must own  And long has prov'd the sav'rite of the town  'Till  Powell  chanc'd within his walk to tread  And pluck'd the blooming laurel from his head  Yet in  Othello  must each actor yield  There even  Garrick  must give up the field  All own him for the part by nature fram'd  And think of  Barry  when  Othello  's nam'd  Not so thy son when in each part he tries  To copy thee too oft from nature flies  Yet will it faintly bear the name of fault  To follow close the manners we are taught  From thee his ev'ry method he conceiv'd  From thee each  beauty  and each fault receiv'd  Nor should we deem him destitute of art  Did he with decency perform  one  part  O could my ardent yet unwilling muse  Obtain one kind and plausible excuse  And without censure be indulged to spare  And overlook the errors of the fair  But chaste  Astrea  guides my feeble hand  And will not listen to my warm demand  Blest with a form of elegance and ease  Two requisites that must for ever please  Who for a season might perhaps engage  When  Yates  awhile retires from the stage  See  Dancer  now each highrate part possess  And try to picture virtue and distress  But judgment seems to leave her in the dark  Whene'er she aims to hit the doubtful mark  With bold presumption in despite of shame  Jefferies  attempts to join the rank of fame  And void of judgment attitude and speech  She aims at characters above her reach  When poor  Alicia  with distraction raves  And calls for racks for thunderbolts and graves  Did  Cinderilla  ever scold so well  When in her airs she bids you  go to hell  When drove by love and passion and despair  And having lost all hopes begins to swear  So sad  Alicia  when by  Jefferies  play'd  A mere impetuous termagant is made  Forgive me  Jefferies  if I speak my mind  True satire never leaves one fault behind  But since she's brought thy errors forth to view  So shall she speak of thy perfections too  In thirdrate parts where nature don't require  Such skill in action or such force of fire  When nor by pride nor by ambition led  The paths of mediocrity you tread  There spite of censure shalt thou justly raise  The smile of pleasure and the voice of praise  See one in parts of wit and humour strive  To catch the manner of a  Pope  or  Clive  For  Gardiner  the copyist betrays  In ev'ry part of humour that she plays  And from her acting it is plainly shewn  She likes their method better than her own  But such a barren genius declares  Who having no intention borrows theirs  Behind appear a despicable race  Without one single requisite or grace  Beneath the notice of my honest muse  Who but to mention would herself abuse  Names both to genius and to fame unknown  The needy stragglers of each country town  Fit but to form some necessary group  Or to compleat  Foote  's miserable troop  When furnish'd out with truncheons and with cloaths  See 'em a  royal company  compose  By these enforc'd and arm'd with impudence  See him invade the boundaries of sense  Break thro' the rules of judgment wit and taste  And lay with ridicule their kingdoms waste  Pleas'd with his own behold the mocker strive  With some success his  Grubstreet  to revive  Vide one of his Puffs in the Gazetteer on Thursday the th of July  And ev'ry season palls us with the same  'Till jaded patience sickens at his name  Each man of candour must in this agree  His merit lies in inconsistency  Pleas'd with the promise of some joyous fun  Away to  Foote  's the herd unthinking run  He gains his riches at the fool's expence  Despis'd and shunn'd by ev'ry man of sense  High on  Parnassus  wou'd he wish to ride  And unrestrain'd the winged courser stride  But is it not most evident to all  The limping Bard has had a fatal fall  A famous playwright wou'd he seem to be  A very Phoenix to posterity  Grief that his name must with his body die  And all his bantlings with their father lie  When lacking his distortion and grimace  Their sole protection and their only grace  Spurn'd and detested in some wiser age  Will never more get footing on the stage  Of these the  Minor  at the head we see  Born at the time of his necessity  When threaten'd by the horrors of a jail  Was forc'd to hoist up ev'ry tatter'd sail  And must have sunk had not the tortur'd  Cole  Who like a pirate he unjustly stole  Buoy'd him when sinking to the welcome shore  And sav'd at once his vessel and his store  The  Lyar  too  his masterpiece confess'd  A very fustianjacket at the best  The  Mayor of Garratt  next we bring to view  Which we must own both laughable and new  But candour will admit of no excuse  Where she beholds such personal abuse  His  Patron Commissary  even all  His filthy drolls beneath this censure fall  His  Orators  a very hodgepodge see  Made up of rubbish and absurdity  Cramm'd full of puns of nonsense and parade  With neither plot or meaning to it's aid  But while to wit he makes the least pretence  Or tries to introduce one line of sense  With vain attempt he stammers at the task  A very  Midas  in  Apollo  's mask  These grown quite threadbare and worn out with age  Like  Foote  himself a nuisance to the stage  He's brought his  Taylors  like a thrifty friend  To botch their elbows and their linings mend  Did  Smithfield  e'er produce a bill so rare  When  Punchinello  was the hero there  Did ever  Flockton  's tragedy excell  Was ever shewbill drawn up half so well  Did ever quack with such parade engage  Not even  Rock  when he adorn'd the stage  Did Taylor e'er with patchwork form a coat  And without  measure  too as  Foote  has wrote  Did ever playwright exercise his quill  With  half  that  humour  or with  half  that  skill  And stock'd like him with  true poetic lore  Write such a  Taylor's tragedy  before  Try'd and condemn'd by th' indulgent town  The father won't his newborn idiot own  But fain wou'd bribe the bawdy muse it's mother  To lay the frightful monster on another  Yet if with close inspection you shou'd trace  The striking outlines of the infant's face  The father's strong resemblance you'll behold  As die to die cast in the selfsame mould  As Epicureans with luxuriant waste  Who lose at once their appetite and taste  And try to teaze the stomach ev'ry hour  With something sweet or else with something sour  Or when the rake is quite indiff'rent grown  Sated with all the pleasures of the town  See him from place to place with transport fly  In search of pleasure in variety  When sick of  high life  he begins to grow  He tries to find a relish in the  low  Foote  next arises to his vacant mind  For there he's sure the simplest fare to find  No heavy sentence to perplex the brain  No searching morals on the mind remain  But like the froth dissolving in the taste  And ere it meets the lip begins to waste  While in our ears he dins the mighty pother  It enters one and hurries out at t'other  THE VICTIM A POEM  INSCRIBED TO JOHN WILKES ESQ  THE VICTIM  IN vain the Nine with all their charms invite  In vain tho' urg'd by zeal may poets write  Pamphlets and novels magazines and plays  From day to day a short sensation raise  And like the rocket mounting to the sky  Catch with delight the pleasurehunting eye  But ere the heart is warm'd the joy is o'er  They blaze they bounce and strait are seen no more  O for that art the sacred art divine  That taught thee  Wilkes  to form the living line  To charm the soul to search the guilty breast  To rouse the Fav'rite from luxuriant rest  Who spight of power or tyrannic pride  Dares to be just and take the weaker side  Whene'er oppression or when party rage  O'erwhelms a starv'd and unsuspecting age  In times of old but times alike to these  Full of corruption luxury and ease  When virtue bled at Mammon's gilded door  And nought was thought a crimebut being poor  When Famine stalk'd rapacious thro' the land  Whilst Justice slept with daggers in her hand  When senators for gold at murder winkt  And godlike Mercy long had been extinct  When injur'd Merit long had su'd in vain  And famish'd peasants left the fertile plain  When Science spurn'd to foreign nations fled  And Wisdom oft at Folly's altar bled  In such an age how rare alas to find  One man existing with untainted mind  Yet of such godlike mortals have I read  When Rome bore all these errors on her head  Who durst in spite of tyranny and pride  Stem the rough torrent of the raging tide  That Rome cou'd boast her worthies it is true  Blest be my stars for Britain boasts 'em too  And must maintain her liberty and fame  Whilst she preserves unstain'd a  Camden  's name  Thro' him each Briton keeps secure his door  And dreads despotic messengers no more  Yet must he own nor think it a disgrace  To  Wilkes  he owes his dignity and place  Tho' Liberty's in ev'ry breast infus'd  By all ador'd and yet by all abus'd  The verriest wretch that treads the lawless streets  Will take the right of ev'ry lord he meets  My lord in councils hold superior sway  And takes each charter'd privilege away  Usurps each blessing giv'n us from above  And tries each wholsome custom to remove  O may destruction wait the villain's head  Who first the baleful seeds of faction spread  Scotchman or English whosoe'er he be  May fate prescribe an ax his destiny  May Justice all his latent projects mar  And six his hateful head on TempleBar  Scotchman or English I will not dispute  The greater knave a  Bd  or a  Be  Or sound the cause from whence such evils rise  I'll leave that task to time's allseeing eyes  And wait the promise of the wise and great  Who move by interest's mighty wheel of state  You're wrong at such a time old Caution cries  With head oft shaken and uplifted eyes  Grave and important eloquent and slow  Pretending ev'ry thing on earth to know  You're wrong said he 'tis not for you or I  To plague ourselves and preach of liberty  Let others fill their heads and crack their brains  Give us the pleasure take who will the pains  Address an exile'tis a fruitless scheme  You ought to make some minister your theme  Some panegyric or some lofty ode  If to the great you mean to make your road  'Tis better far than exercise your pen  In holding up to view the faults of men  Yet hold I cry'd your counsel pray forbear  I will no more such admonition hear  And may contempt for ever blast my lays  Whene'er I flatter where I mean to praise  Tho' pale Detraction with her hundred heads  Her aconitum thro' the nation spreads  Infects each mind and dims each candid eye  And stupifies the babe credulity  Yes I will speak tho' vengeance o'er me hung  With threat'ning eyes to stop my ardent tongue  Tho' exil'd and by party overthrown  Bereft of ev'ry rentroll of thy own  Deny'd in peace to tread thy native land  Where ev'ry foreign beggar bears command  Where knaves from ev'ry shore in splendour tread  While many a worthy Briton dies for bread  Shall I forget when welt'ring in thy blood  I saw thee panting for thy country's good  Sanguine in Liberty's immortal laws  I saw thee fall a martyr to her cause  Struggling 'gainst death with Roman fortitude  Till thou his alldestroying arm subdu'd  But Fate preserv'd thee for some better end  To prove ere yet a sinking nation's friend  In spite what dull Indiff'rence may suggest  For fools are ever apt to think the best  And like the ox no dangers ever dread  Till the sad stroke falls heavy on their head  For O my country feel you not the wound  Look back awhile and cast your eyes around  View but the lawns where once with glee you fed  Where Plenty once her choicest treasure's spread  Where peace was wont to smile throughout the plains  And labour met reward for all her pains  Now Famine takes her seat whose baleful eye  Blasts every blade and kills each matchless die  Peace leaves her cot and Plenty takes her flight  Whilst roselipt Hope is overwhelm'd in night  Sunk is each eye and sallow ev'ry cheek  The rifl'd poor in vain for refuge seek  In vain the hunger'd infant cries for bread  While the sad mother droops her woeful head  Her breast its wonted aliment denies  And faminestruck her little cherub dies  Fell Hyporborean laws alas prevail  Sunk is each science crowded ev'ry jail  Famine and pride now rule with dreadful awe  O'erwhelm fair Commerce and pervert each law  The sacred mandate first by heav'n assign'd  Will'd by the God of Nature for mankind  Fair order and society to frame  And make eternal love's extatic name  See human laws presumptive break the tie  And set the faith boundhand at liberty  Divorce succeeds divorce whene'er the mind  Debas'd is to some other face inclin'd  Unknown to love yet urge the holy state  Submit the knee and rashly stipulate  They greet the portion but return the wife  With scanty pittance for the rest of life  Foy the muse abominates to see  So vile a part so well perform'd by thee  The mind corrupt to ev'ry vice a slave  Thy every act still constitutes the knave  But such examples are the subjects own  They cannot say they have 'em from the throne  There in the greatest may you plainly see  The envy'd state of true tranquility  A royal pattern for a nation's guide  To all who wish to list on virtue's side  The best of father's in the best of kings  In whom benevolence for ever springs  A lovely offspring dimpl'd o'er with charms  To grace the throne or weild the British arms  When years mature shall call 'em to defend  A nation's right and prove each subject's friend  To dignify with fame the living page  And be the wonder of some future age  Seal'd be each eye and deaf be ev'ry ear  To shield the heart and stop the ebbing tear  Dark was the hour and involv'd in night  When Rapine reign'd assassins shun'd the light  When Agathonian riots gorg'd the soul  And traytors trembl'd at the midnight owl  When bawds for pay seduc'd the blushing fair  Entrapping Virtue with a golden snare  I'llstar'd  Lucretia  at that fatal time  Ripe in thy charms and tempting in thy prime  The lustful  Tarquin  stole into thy arms  And rifl'd all thy virginboasted charms  What days but these cou'd such a deed restore  What man could act it but a  Baltimore  And who like him cou'd grace the am'rous page  The debauchee and  Tarquin  of the age  Unhappy maid may Justice plad thy cause  Nor suffer Mammon to subvert her laws  To set fair Truth and Innocence aside  And overwhelm thee in a golden tide  O may some  Camden  rescue thee from shame  Nor let the mighty stigmatize thy name  Reveal each action to the public eye  Restore each truth invalidate each lie  Nor let the potent ravisher prevail  How well soe'er he varnish o'er his tale  May fierce  Alecto  with gorgonian locks  In veng'ance chace him to the Stygian rocks  To howl unpity'd on the burning shore  Where the baleful fiends eternal discord roar  Each nation boasts its own peculiar vice  From constitution or from meer caprice  France is to fashion an eternal slave  And ever known more politic than brave  The Britons rout 'em on the sea or field  But to their fashions and their follies yield  Who ever shew deny it if you can  The arrant coxcomb overcomes the man  So fond of mode and nonsense are we grown  We scarce can relish one thing of our own  But from our pu'rile and unstable state  We meanly condescend to imitate  The hattremendous once and deeply brimm'd  Anon behold it to a cockle trimm'd  The shoe once buckl'd half way to the knee  Anon 'tis buckled to the toe you see  And Monsieurs coat attracts with equal charms  Whether the skirts hang from the hips or arms  When ev'ry alien take it for a rule  Will call his aukward coppiest a fool  What height of madness and what mode intense  At once to forfeit decency and sense  O never more the British name degrade  Nor be again the dupes of fashion made  But be yourselves bold generous and wise  And all such foreign frippery despise  The Scotch all maxims but their own deride  From native envy or from native pride  Bold in the field and letter'd in the school  Declares the Scot cannot be quite a fool  Tho' bare each hill and steril ev'ry plain  They try to culture and manure the brain  From this their pride proceeds whose bootless store  For ever keeps dame Fortune from the door  Edina  ever with a jealous eye  Frown'd on her sister's vast fertility  Oft has she led her legions to the field  And smote Britannia's adamantine shield  Whose fierce repulse oblig'd her famish'd band  To keep the limits of her native land  The sword in vain with all her might she drew  In hope our envy'd nation to subdue  To institute her base despotic laws  To save a  Stewart  and defend his cause  Whose sanguine name has left a purple stain  Fit to adorn a priestrode tyrant's reign  Now hostile hopes subside the supple knee  Pretended friendship and hypocrisy  Make more advancements in the public weal  Than all the havock of the pointed steel  For what but discord has been heard alone  E'er since a Stuart stood so near the throne  To whom can Fate these murmurings impute  But the despotic principles of  B  Exotic maxims cause domestic broils  And ev'ry tranquil happiness despoils  The knavish tutor politic and kind  Protests his friendship but conceals his mind  Which ever leaning to some selfish end  He acts the villain most to seem the friend  My lord lays open his unwary heart  And falls a victim to a traytor's art  Fond of her flights the muse wou'd fain intrude  To draw unskill'd a faint similitude  'Tween who or what I'll leave mankind to guess  Or those who wish a nation's happiness  By other's folly we are often shewn  The hateful mirrour and despise our own  All can behold the blemish but the blind  To let him feel it then is surely kind  Once on a time the fam'd historian writes  Skill'd in the annals of the Troglodites  Capricious realm in Africa remote  Where feeds the pard where climbs the mountaingoat  A noble youth benevolent and kind  To vice a foe to ev'ry good inclin'd  Born to a throne and rais'd to high degree  Ere he had tasted of maturity  Sprung from a stock that had been long ador'd  Whose valiant arms a welcome peace restor'd  A long contention with a tyrant held  And made the thistle to the olive yield  The plains rejoic'd and bless'd the great event  And drank the cup of plenty and content  Ev'n infants whisper'd great  Muzeedan  's name  And virgins crown'd him with the wreath of fame  A slave from Envy and from Famine sprung  All supple was his knee all sweet his tongue  Yet held  Muzeedan  in eternal hate  His foe's dear kinsman and his advocate  Albuda  he a northern mountaineer  His looks were agalastic and severe  His eyes malignant with a tear conceal'd  While he his story to the youth reveal'd  Feign'd a false zeal and flatter'd in his praise  The track each villain takes ere he betrays  And like the pill all gilded to the eyes  Few can discover where the poison lies  Till with celerity it makes its way  Thro' ev'ry pore and shuts the eyes from day  The slave prevail'd the youth too soon believ'd  The mind untainted is the first deceiv'd  His manners gentle and his speech was fair  His breast kept no malignant tenant there  Save what  Albuda  introduc'd by art  Who drain'd the springs of virtue from his heart  Infusing strange chimera's in his mind  To rule tyrannic and oppress mankind  When ev'ry needy minion of his own  Was introduc'd and planted round the throne  Lost to himself  Muzeedan  's mind gave way  And bore the sceptre with despotic sway  The subject saw it and in murmurs loud  A threat'ning discord breath'd throughout the crowd  Whilst hydralike Revenge rear'd up her head  At whose dread roar the peaceful village fled  Domestic broils and savage war began  And with destruction thro' the nation ran  Rebellion drew her sword whose hand like fate  Shock the foundation of the throne and state  Albuda  saw it with enraptur'd eyes  And vulturelike he stood to seize his prize  Plung'd the vile poniard in  Muzeedan  's side  And bath'd his fingers in the purple tide  Then with his legions who in secret lay  Stole the long envy'd diadem away  Rush'd on the croud confus'd who thought to save  Their liberty but fell still more a slave  With eyes dejected and with tears they view'd  The sacred name of liberty subdu'd  And with despair and agony they saw  Rise in her stead each hyperborean law  Whose arms oppressive made the subject groan  From the hard burdens of a tyrants throne  O may each monarch shun  Muzeedan  's fate  And ev'ry subject closely eye the state  Nor suffer one  Albuda  more so near  To whisper poison in a prince's ear  May plenty flow and public discord cease  May Brunswick reign in everlasting peace  Curs'd be the tongueaudaciousthat shall dare  To vent its poison on a name so fair  Whose royal stock bore terror in the field  And yet with lenity the sceptre held  Mercy subdu'd the warlike victor's breast  And justice shone illustrious on his crest  Peace was the study of his royal mind  At once the friend and father of mankind  SONGS c  YOUNG JOCKEY OF THE CARRON SIDE  Sung by Mrs Barthelemon at Marybone  Set to Music by Mr Barthelemon  YE silly lasses of the green  Your leers and smiles are vain  Who try with gaudy geer to wean  My bonny bonny swain  He sees your scarlet knots and bows  But views them with disdain  For I alone receive the vows  Of my dear bonny swain  He is the wonder and the pride  Of all the rural plain  No shepherd treads the Carron side  Like my dear bonny swain  While Carron gently steals along  To hear his lovely strain  The flocks and herds impatient throng  Around my bonny swain  Next Sabbath is our weddingday  I ne'er shall fear again  Lest some might steal the heart away  Of my dear bonny swain  Then lasses try with all your skill  My Jockey's love to gain  When I have both the heart and will  Of my dear bonny swain  SONG  Sung by Mrs Barthelemon at Marybone  Set to Music by Mr Barthelemon  SURE Wolly will never return back again  I've waited this hour or more  Like the poor linnet I am left to complain  That sits on the whinns of the moor  When will my Wolly return  When will my Wolly return  Some damsel has stole the dear heart of my swain  And I shall ne'er see my sweet Wolly again  The thrush and the ousel are now gone to rest  The bat and the owl are awing  The sun has this hour been sunk in the west  And nightlulling nightingales sing  Alack and awelladay  What can my Wolly delay  Some damsel has stole the dear heart of my swain  And I shall ne'er see my sweet Wolly again  SONG  Sung by Mrs Baddeley at Vauxhall  Set to Music by Mr Snow  THE morn was fair and Phoebus peept  O'er the blue mountains head  While in his cavern Boreas slept  And Morpheus fled the mead  The cowslips op'd their velvet leaves  And incens'd ev'ry vale  Whilst Cupid wanton'd on the trees  Rock'd by some gentle gale  Young Celon came by four o'clock  To meet his lovely fair  Neglecting all his tender flock  That once was all his care  With plaintive notes he lull'd the grove  Till Eddie trod the plain  But soon as he beheld his love  He chang'd his mournful strain  Like Flora's handmaid deck'd in green  The smiling fair appear'd  Her countenance was all serene  At once belov'd and fear'd  With Love and Joy fix'd on each face  They rambl'd blithe and gay  And with a mutual fond embrace  They fix'd their weddingday  The smiling maids and jolly swains  Donn'd in their best array  Came trudging o'er the verdant plains  And made a holiday  In rustic dance and merry song  None car'd to be outdone  The swains they wrestl'd all day long  And gambol'd down the sun  A CATCH  To be sung by Three Men as the Lines are numbered  WHAT makes a modern gentleman  The glory of the nation  To be as simple as you can  A coward in a passion  To keep a whore and starve a wife  The taylor and the tonser  Damme boys but that is life  To have a wife and sconce her  The world must end as it began  Say is it not the fashion  Wed first then whore that is the plan  A world of innovation  SONG  WHene'er my Patty trips the green  I feel a pleasing pain  She gives a lustre to the scene  The Dian of the plain  How does my heart with rapture heave  When for an humble bow  A grateful curtsey I receive  Say is it love or no  Would I a happy shepherd were  And she a shepherd's maid  That I might tell my tale sincere  Beneath some rural shade  But now with awe I view each charm  And fear my flame to own  Lest she shou'd all my love disarm  With one indignant frown  Ye Gods inspire me to the deed  Incline the maid to hear  For O I love I love indeed  And with a heart sincere  List lovely Patty to my strain  And ease my tortur'd breast  Ye Gods I'd never more complain  If once with Patty blest  A DIALOGUE SONG  CLODY and CLARA  IS it because I love you more  Than mortal man e'er lov'd before  Is it your sport to use me so  Will you not marry Clara  Clara  No  Why will you tease me ev'ry day  When I've so often said ye nay  Have I not often bid you go  Prithee now leave me Clody  Clody  No  Wou'd you then see poor Clody die  Rather than with his suit comply  Have you no feelings for my woe  When I so dearly love you  Clara  No  Were you in love all day to pine  And at my door all night to whine  My heart would still the harder grow  Now will you follow Clara  Clody  No  Since you're so savage and unkind  I'll try some other maid to find  But none shall ever treat me so  For Clara has discharg'd me  Clara  No  I hope my Clody does but rave  Have I not been thy loving slave  I was in joke pray do not go  Will you not Clara marry  Clody  No  You've teas'd the humble mouse too long  You've done your faithful Clody wrong  Now to the winds my love I'll blow  And heed no more your  yes  or  no  Clara  Prithee my Clody do not go  Clody  Have you not said too often  no  Clara  Are you not joking sure you are  Clody  Have you not born the joke too far  Clara  But I will never more do so  Say will you not believe me  Clody  No  TO A FRIEND IN THE COUNTRY  SPITE of the hubbub of the town  Between the multitude and crown  To 'scape the sousing of a shower  And crib unto myself an hour  I in a coffeehouse took shelter  For troth it rained helter skelter  I know what I had there to do  So down I sat to write to you  Yet I should be most glad to see  You do the same and write to me  Tho' now you say you spend your time  To better purposes than rhime  Love has stol'n that heart away  That us'd so wantonly to play  On fam'd Parnassus' musing hill  Or near the Heliconian rill  Most glad I am and yet I pine  So dear a comrade to resign  Most glad I am the smiling boy  Has let you taste Hymenial joy  The most substantial bliss of life  A constant loving virtuous wife  With joy I  hear  in fancy  see  Nor envy your tranquility  I wou'd not covet from a brother  I only wish I'd such another  A countryhouse as far from town  A horse that I could call my own  A dog and gun at my command  Well match'd or trained to my hand  To hear the bleating herds complain  When landstorms drive them from the plain  Or when at morn with joy they bleat  Their fleecy friends again to meet  And then reflect on what I've seen  When I've in CoventGarden been  Where thieves and vintners pimps and whores  Croud around their hellish doors  A tricking flatt'ring fawning race  Who're glad to whisper your disgrace  But loudly to your face commend  And give you credit like a friend  But soon they bring you to repent  And raise your debt to ten per cent  Yet hold my Muse I prithee hold  The shower's o'er my coffee cold  Pray do not run me out of rhime  Left I shou'd want another time  VERSES On a distressed Family that were ruined by a Great Man's Promise  Supposed to be spoken by the Father  NO no I will no more believe  Or listen to thy tale  Thou shalt no more my ear deceive  Thy promises are stale  No more the fancy'd prospect view  That charm'd my anxious eyes  Which thou uncharitably drew  Thy falshoods to disguise  For ever darken'd be the scene  That led me first astray  Where Hope was clad in lively green  And Promises were May  Ah why should that strong anchor'd maid  Lend knaves so fair a cloak  For promises with Varo fade  Before they well are spoke  Hence thou bewitching smiling fiend  Thou shalt no more delude  Thy word is smoke thy promise wind  But ah what wind so rude  Now on a wide and troubl'd sea  Am I for ever tost  And Varo when I think on thee  My peace of mind is lost  The mournful partner of my breast  My little cherubs too  Alas my heart is sore distress'd  When ere I think of you  How does it rack me to dispair  To hear my Mira sigh  Or when the big heartcleving tear  Stands trembling in her eye  When round my knees with lisping grief  My little dear ones prate  I once cou'd give their wants relief  But now it is too late  Bereft of all domestic joys  I strive to hope in vain  A broken promise oft destroys  But seldom cures again  ON MR AND MRS PRINCE'S BIRTHDAYS  The one born on ChristmasDay the other on ChristmasEve  HARK the Robinredbreast sings  And with his little gladsome wings  Rejoices that the season's near  Which brings high merriment and cheer  When ev'ry Bumpkin's morning cry  Is ale and cake roast beef and pye  Poor Robin on the threshold comes  And feasts upon the scatter'd crumbs  When full he mounts the snowclad tree  And sings his carol merrily  At such a time wou'd you believe  Fair B was born one ChristmasEve  Fame and Report still farther say  A Prince was born on ChristmasDay  As if both eager to partake  Of the rich wellsugar'd cake  As if each bore a greater mind  Than one day more to be confin'd  But hearing each exalted voice  They came impatient to rejoice  Ere eighteen winters had slid by  Young Cupid like an archer fly  Together met 'em in a grove  Talking o'er the theme of love  When leaves were green and Flora spread  Her varied carpet o'er the mead  He took his aim with godlike art  And pierc'd at once the Prince's heart  He aim'd another at the fair  Then laughing cry'd I've shot a pair  As a true sportsman always sends  His wounded game to treat his friends  As Hymen and the God of Love  Were ever known as hand and glove  He sent and sign'd 'em with his name  Hymen receiv'd and with his flame  He touch'd their hearts and bound their hands  And bid 'em follow his commands  To wear his signet on their breast  Whether exalted or distress'd  Nor let one cold indignant frown  E'er wither Love's immortal crown  Then heal'd the wounds which love had made  They both consented and obey'd  The  Prince  a husband still remains  And she a  Princess  both in chains  But wear them chearful and confess  The chain of love is  happiness  EPIGRAM ON DR WEEZLE  Doctor to the  honourable  Lumber Troop who voluntarily gave his attendance and officiously attempted to ruin a young gentleman and a tender familywho never injured him  OFficious Sir with strut and look so big  With lanthorn body and tremendous wig  Is't not enough that for meer want of skill  You daily some unhappy patient kill  Must you when all your filthy nostrums fail  Lurk bailiff like and drag your friends to jail  You take the life take soul too all you can  Turn bailiff for the Devilthat's your plan  You lurk so cunning and look out so well  The Devil need not doubt you'll furnish hell  ON THE DEATH OF LORD EGLINGTON  In the manner of the Chevy Chace  THE morn was fair the air serene  And cheer'd each shepherd lad  The rustling woods were dress'd in green  The vales with verdure clad  Ceres her golden crops had shorn  And harvesthome had sung  With Dian's hounds and early horn  The hills and vallies rung  At such a time on such a day  Lord Eglington arose  Then sally'd he with horse away  And to the woodland goes  His coat was all of Saxon green  And velvet was his cap  A neater sportsman ne'er was seen  To scout the mountain  lap  A bolder steed a braver  Sir  Ne'er follow'd hunter's cry  For e'er he ply'd the chafing spur  He seem'd to ride and fly  His dogs well train'd no better sure  Ere couched at command  A gun more certain and secure  Ne'er graced a sportsman's hand  O'er rocks thro' woods and down the steep  Like Perseus in his pride  'Twould glad the heart to see him sweep  Adown the mountain side  Beneath an hill alack the day  A lurking poacher stood  All eager watching for his prey  Beside a lonely wood  Who thought ere long some snipe or hare  Wou'd rise within his shot  He cock'd his gun he trim'd his snare  But little prov'd his lot  Anon a lovely woodcock stired  Within the wat'ry brake  Which soon the watchful spaniel heard  Who to his master spake  The poacher heard the fond alarm  And saw the victim rise  He pois'd his piece with skilful  arm  He shot and hit his prize  Then instantly  recharg'd  with speed  And watch'd with greedy eye  But little thought who next wou'd bleed  What nobler game shou'd die  Unlucky shot unlucky bird  To loose thy harmless state  Unlucky Eglington that heard  The summons to thy fate  O hadst thou elsewhere been engaged  We had not felt this woe  Had'st thou in warlike combat wag'd  With some more noble foe  Some fiend of fate was sure abroad  And mischief bore command  Thy stars combind in one accord  And death stood  dart in hand  My lord pursued the fatal sound  With anger in his mind  And in the vale the poacher found  Upon his gun reclin'd  When thus he 'gan the man to chide  That durst invade the law  Who strove his gun and game to hide  And blush'd with guilt and awe  Resign presumptious hind resign  Thou hast no business here  These lands and woods thou know'st are mine  Resign or thou'lt pay dear  I'll not resign thou haughty lord  Altho' these lands are thine  I've said it and I'll keep my word  The gun shall still be mine  The hand that gave each creature breath  And planted ev'ry tree  Will shield me from the hand of death  As soon as it will thee  Impartial nature ne'er design'd  That lords alone shou'd reign  To tax the air to rule the wind  The tyrants of the plain  I feel an appetite and will  A thirst for pleasure too  And have as great a right to kill  And eat as well as you  Now boil'd the blood within the veins  Of brave lord Eglington  Rage unbridl'd all her reins  Whilst veng'ence spur'd him on  With blood all blurted in his face  And lightning in his eyes  I'll not endure this language base  From one like thee he cries  Harsh was the language which he spoke  Like Hercules he frown'd  And with a stout and pithy oak  He struck him to the ground  As one fell'd by a thunder stroke  He speechless lay awhile  Then half recovered thus he spoke  In melancholy stile  Inhuman lord you little know  The means that brought me here  You might have spar'd each cruel blow  And yielded me a tear  Is it because that chance has thrown  Thee into fortune's arms  To call these woods and vales thy own  Which yield a thousand charms  Is it for this that thou shou'dst be  So cruel and unkind  A stranger to humanity  Where poverty you find  It is because thou art in need  Of what my gun has slain  If that should be the case indeed  I ne'er would shoot again  Or if like me thou shouldst depend  On what the fields afford  Who save my gun can boast no friend  To furnish out my board  For know proud Lord I should not care  To venture forth for game  Were I not hunted by despair  To risk my life and name  Go to yon cot and there survey  A scene Wou'd melt a stone  Where oft I sigh the livelong day  In melancholy moan  Where the sad mother weeping stands  Surrounded by a brood  That lift their little harmless hands  And cry aloud for food  Where through the low and shatter'd wall  Keen blows the whistling wind  When snows in fleecy showers fall  And winter bites unkind  When trees that late with leaves were hung  Small icicles adorn  And where the chearful thrushes sung  The stockdoves  sit forlorn  There bolden'd by my wretched state  Thro' these fair lands I roam  And when good luck shall prove my fate  I bring my treasures home  With joy I see my infants feed  And bless the lucky day  I feel no sorrow at the deed  While round my hearth they play  Audacious clown replied my lord  That dares thus to my face  Thy lawless practices record  And boast an act so base  But these instructions I'll not bear  And therefore clown resign  Thou shalt nor woodcock shoot nor  hare  While these fair lands are mine  Throw down your  arms  and go your  gate  And follow good advice  You will repent it man too late  If here you venture twice  I'll go my gate the poacher cry'd  And here offend no more  The world thank Heaven's fair and wide  'Twas made for rich and poor  'Tis gi'en the bold and pamper'd steed  To brouze in pastures gay  On rich and luscious food to feed  And wanton all the day  Whilst Nature's slave the humble ass  Dejected meek and poor  Is glad a leisure day to pass  Upon the barren moor  Releas'd his burden there he feeds  And thinks the thistle sweet  He asks no more than nature needs  A belly full's a treat  He thirsts not for the gold he bears  When weary on the road  But ever happy he appears  If moderate his load  So I emburden'd with distress  Deny'd these vales to tread  I'll forth to yonder wilderness  And seek my daily bread  The forest broad the dreary wilds  Tho' poor may yet be kind  There fortune yield me but thy smiles  Then blow the roughest wind  I ask not for her gold nor wealth  Be those for lazy pride  Give me but raiment food and health  The rest let fools divide  There spight of thee thou haughty peer  I'll drink tranquility  Nor shall I live again in fear  Of such a thing as thee  Cease cease thou presumptious slave  Nor think I'll list to thee  Thou empty moralizing knave  How dar'st thou preach to me  Resign thy gun thou loon I say  Or by my soul I swear  I'll make thee fellow rue the day  That ever thou cam'st here  Then aiming at the poacher's head  Who laugh'd at what he spoke  As if he meant to strike him dead  E'en at a single stroke  The poacher to evade the blow  Three paces back retir'd  His face with passion 'gan to glow  As if his heart were fir'd  I swear then by my breath and blood  My gun and I won't part  To prove that it's contents are good  Here take 'em to thy heart  This done down upon the ground he fell  Like to a wounded deer  And sighing wish'd a long farewell  To his Corina dear  Now all aghast the poacher stood  To see his deed so foul  Convulsed boil'd his guilty blood  And horror seiz'd his soul  As one distact and wild was he  All stiffen'd with surprize  Then falling on his bended knee  Aloud to heav'en cries  Have mercy mercy Gracious God  Withold the hand of death  O spare O spare thy dreadful rod  O spare O spare his breath  Where shall I go where shall I hide  How 'scape thy wond'rous eyes  How drive the spector from my side  When consciencemurder cries  Accursed be this vile machine  Accurs'd the luckless hour  O had I in the desart been  Where savages devour  Or near the threat'ning billows swell  Had I been doom'd to stand  Where thy prophetic mermaids yell  Along the dreadful strand  O had some skylark rais'd in air  Or had it prov'd my lot  That snipe or partridge quail or hare  Had fall'n beneath my shot  For ah I little thought to find  Such noble game as thee  Or that the fates had e'er design'd  This bloody task for me  Dear hasty youth cou'd I restore  That life I've ta'en away  I wou'd my better stars implore  And pine from day to day  O let me raise thy drooping head  And lift thee from the ground  And leave O leave this goary bed  Whilst angels heal the wound  With deathly cheek and fainting eye  The bleeding Earl reply'd  O bear me Poacher ere I die  To my Corina's side  There let me take my last farewell  Once more behold her charms  That fame to future times may tell  I died within her arms  Do this be all thy sins forgiv'n  Altho' by thee I bleed  Do this and may alljudging heav'n  O'erlook thy bloody deed  The tears fast down the Poacher's cheek  In streaming showers fell  He beat his breast he strove to speak  And strove to say farewell  Grief choak'd all utt'rance for a while  But now to words gave way  When in a souldestracted stile  He 'gan with tears to pray  Great God of mercy yet restore  This sad this bleeding lord  For O his goodness wounds me more  Then cou'd his keenest sword  O spare my shame my grief despair  O spare his precious life  In pity to that tender fair  His wish'd his promis'd wife  Ah me she comes my hateful deed  Is blown through all the world  I soon shall be too sure I read  To dark perdition hurl'd  My  glass  is run  Time  tolls my knell  My wretched reign is o'er  My wife my little babes farewel  I ne'er shall see you more  Accurs'd am I of all mankind  To leave ye thus undone  Ah where will you a father find  When I am dead and gone  With eyes distract dishevel'd hair  The sad Corina came  Her cries and shriekings pierc'd the air  With calling on his name  The names of Death and Eglington  She join'd in accents sad  In pity mighty God look down  O let me not be mad  Wilt thou eclipse him from my sight  By death's relentless hand  My blessed Sun that shon so bright  The wonder of the land  He saw her pangs her voice he heard  He pressed her to his side  Death in his face all pale appear'd  He bless'd her sigh'd and died  THE BIRD'S NEST A FABLE  FOUR giddy boys play'd truant once  Who never blush'd at name of dunce  But rather choose to live as fools  Than bear confinement in the schools  As near a wood they chanc'd to stray  They found a bird'snest in their way  All eager scrambling for the nest  But one much taller than the rest  Secur'd the prize each claim'd a share  The tallest did not hold it fair  And with an aggravating frown  He vow'd he'd keep it all his own  The rest with rage were fit to burst  When each declar'd he saw it first  And rather than give up their right  They 'gan to quarrel next to fight  The nest was on a haycock put  'Till they decided the dispute  A clown just by emerging lay  To see 'em once begin the fray  He knew he should for he was wise  While they were fighting steal the prize  No sooner had the fray began  But with the nest away he ran  The scuffle over to his cost  The hero found his prize was lost  Each 'gan to simper at his brother  To find that after all their pother  The potent point so soon decided  And ev'ry share so well divided  THE PETTICOAT A NEW SONG  To the Tune of Chevey Chase  'TWAS sometime worthy sirs in May  No matter in what year  When boys and girls together play  And drink in merry cheer  It happen'd once a waggish set  Bethought 'em of a joke  And near a mighty mansion met  The Lord on't to provoke  High in the air a trophy bore  I'faith a strange conceit  And crowding round his lordship's door  They hallow'd  bread and meat  A magistrate in truth was he  Of noble blood deriv'd  No mortal had a heart more free  His equal ne'er surviv'd  The uproar drew his lordship out  To know what it cou'd mean  But on his chaps receiv'd a clout  That sent him in again  But turning round he cast his eyes  And view'd the shameful scene  Revenge revenge revenge he cries  Was ere the like on't seen  A pettycoat and breeches hung  Both dangling on a pole  The street with claps and hissing rung  Enough to charm one's soul  The meaning soon his lordship knew  And streight he rais'd a band  Who joining him like hero's flew  And seiz'd it sword in hand  Did ever knight in days in yore  Atchieve such envy'd fame  Did ever mortal man before  Deserve so great a name  The k God bless his royal heart  Of his own wise accord  Streight acted he the ky part  And gave him due reward  Now high in council seat he's plac'd  To rule o'er rich and poor  Was ever k before so grac'd  By any man before  Now be it known to great and small  The wonders he has done  And to his fame let bunters ball  As thro' the streets they run  THE PEASANT AND THE ANT A FABLE  THE fields were ripen'd all around  And Ceres' head with corn was crown'd  Pomona with her fruits array'd  And plenty coy much envied maid  Her horn of bounty careless held  And dropt a gift in every field  A peasant walking through the grain  Was heard to murmur and complain  His face was wan and meagre grown  And hunger stamp'd him with a frown  A laden ant was passing by  And with her small insectic eye  She look'd upon the abject man  And with revilings thus began  "Art not asham'd ungrateful clown  "Amongst such crops thy wants to own  "Whilst smiling plenty round thee stands  "Inviting thy unwilling hands  "Thou poor incorrigible knave  "Thy sloth will bring thee to the grave  "Benevolence is thrown away  "On such as thou art ev'ry day  "How can'st thou ever think to thrive  "Except with industry thou'lt strive  "To help thyself when there is giv'n  "Before thine eyes such stores from heav'n  "Had I one opportunity  "Like this I'd lay such plenty by  "In such a season I'd provide  "Enough for all my days beside  "But I'm obliged each day to roam  "Many a furlong from my home  "And cry good luck when'er I pick  "From off the ground a single stick  "Or in some long or rutty lane  "I find by chance a single grain  "Had I the art and strength like you  "To reap to thresh to bake and brew  "I would not murmur nor complain  "At winter's snow or summer's rain  "Which heav'n in each season sends  "To answer all its wiser ends"  "Thou boasting thing the clown reply'd  "Thou little crawling piece of pride  "Or stop thy foul reproaching breath  "This moment else shall be thy denth  "For all thy counsel's mere pretence  "To shew thy mighty share of sense  "Thy industry and insolence  "Thou would'st not in this manner prate  "Wert thou like me of human state  "Were what I've reap'd and what I've sown  "Like what thou gather'st  all my own  "My barns should every one be stor'd  "And I as well as thou would hoard  "I own the seasons plenty send  "Were men like ants each other's friend  "I would not now come murm'ring here  "Were food and raiment not so dear  "Those times thou sure must own are bad  "When there's no victuals to be had  "When Nature sends her stores at large  "And Earth does all her gifts discharge  "'Tis not by God but man deny'd  "Who feasts in luxury and pride  "For see yon infant starving dies  "With all this bounty 'fore his eyes"  THE APOLOGY  There is no reason to comment  The moral is most evident  The PRETTY MAID of CHELMSFORD  A Pretty maid both kind and fair  Dwells in  Chelmsford  town  Her pleasing smiles her easy air  Engages fop and clown  Being accosted t'other day  By a clumsy 'squire  Who ask'd her if she knew the way  To quench a raging fire  Water Sir reply'd the maid  Will quench it in a trice  O no said he you little jade  I've try'd that once or twice  Then Sir said she 'tis past my skill  To tell you what will do  I'm sure said he you know what will  There's nothing can but you  Alasaday what do you mean  Reply'd the pretty fair  I'd have you try it once again  You never shou'd despair  Despair I cannot cry'd the 'squire  While you are in my sight  'Tis you must quench the burning fire  You set it first alight  Then strait he clasp'd her round the waist  And forc'd from her a kiss  Ho ho said she is that your taste  Then pray you Sir take this  And with a pail plac'd at the door  She sluic'd the amorous 'squire  Your'e welcome Sir to this and more  To quench your raging fire  AN EVENING's WALK  ONE Summer's eve when ev'ry swain was hous'd  When Sol had scarce one glimmer left behind  Each little star faint glitt'ring cast a ray  And spangled o'er the dusky robe of night  Fond of the scene I wander'd far from home  O'er level lawns and flowerbreeding vales  Till weary nature slacken'd in my steps  And made me halt upon a friendly bank  Calm thro' a bridge there ran a peerless stream  That scarcely mov'd the ozier's slender wand  Here I took my stand and view'd the solemn scene  The bat had been an hour on the wing  Chasing the nightfly and the buzzing gnat  The purblind owl had left the antient tower  Prowling with flossy wing along the mead  Anon as out of Chaos shot a ray  Of chearing light quiv'ring o'er the hills  As yet too weak to struggle with the dark  Or as th' Egyptian queen far off beheld  Shot her first beams on the Italian shore  Her brilliant train reflecting on the waves  Making the Tybur like a golden sea  Clouds that o'erhung the horizon unseen  Appear'd in view like silverskirted troops  Waiting the uprise of the queen of night  Slow she approach'd and smil'd upon the world  Op'ning fresh landscapes to my wond'ring eyes  Philomel now chear'd the embow'ring grove  The woodlark too mistaking it for day  Join'd her sweet notes with emulating strains  Near to my left there stood an ancient pile  By wasting time and savage war defac'd  Like a reduc'd and hoaryheaded chief  Commanding awe even in destruction  On its flinty fides deepdy'd ivy clung  Its roof was capt with velvetgrounded moss  And round its base wild weeds and flowers grew  The stinging nettle with the briars blend  The secret haunt of adders and of toads  Thro' the wide breaches of the rockbuilt walls  Pale Cynthia beam'd her lucid columns down  Upon the verdant slope in lines direct and clear  Reflecting on a dimpled brook below  A solemn silence now o'erspread the globe  Save when the minew wanton'd on the stream  And left a circle spreading to the brink  Anon as wind from out some hollow cave  A deepfelt sigh from out the ruins came  As from a heart just bursting with its load  Which streight was answer'd with a voice of woe  Like sorrow soothing the more sad despair  Awhile I stood in doubt to know the cause  Or to retreat least some deluding fiend  Feigning the voice of grief meant to destroy  At length resolv'd with caution I approach'd  O melting sight my wounded heart ran o'er  And empty'd at my eyesA mournful pair  The woeful partners of affliction sat  On the low basis of a mould'ring urn  And open'd to my view a tragic scene  Conceal'd I stood observing their distress  She in her lap an infant cherub held  A lovely boy the offspring of their loves  Her eyes were bent with sorrow on the babe  While in her face the little dear one smil'd  And then with tears of misery and love  She clung him eager to her throbbing breast  The wretched husband on her neck reclin'd  Striving to chear his melancholy dame  Feign'd a hope tho' foreign to his heart  But when he found despair had seiz'd her soul  His tears burst forth and bath'd his manly cheeks  And on his bended knees he trembling fell  Lifting his eyes with anguish 'gainst the sky  With invocations loud and agonizing sighs  Imploring heaven for a ray of peace  Till his loud accents shook the vaulted roof  And rift his tortur'd breastI cou'd no more  But flying to his aid with heart distress'd  He fix'd his eyes with furious glare upon me  And threaten'd me with death if I advanc'd  Like the fierce tyger assail'd by hunters  In his dreary den he stood defensive o'er his young  Shielding 'em from danger With humble voice  And friendly tears I mov'd him to attend  And listen patient to the voice of pity  Joy then with fear and admiration mix'd  O'erspread each face and as I spake they blest  Hope like the sun that clouds had long o'erveil'd  Flush'd on their cheeks extinguishing despair  Ye woeful pair let your suspicions cease  If friends forsake and creditors pursue  If you once more can trust a thought to hope  And think it possible to meet a friend  Tell me your story and you yet shall find  That fate relents and ceases to afflict  Tho' here to you a stranger I appear  To mercy I am none to see another wretched  Makes me wretched too by serving others  I still myself oblige and meet reward  Ample reward a tranquil happiness  Seeing others so by me made happy  I'd rather wipe the tear of grief away  Than add a ruby to a monarch's crown  And win a prince's promise for my pains  If fate's not giv'n you over to despair  And you'll accept of friendship once again  Chear your sad heartslet ev'ry fear subside  Nor doubt a stranger yet may prove a friend  If you'd be happy tell me but in what  I'll try my ev'ry means to make ye so  Thou gracious being if thou art human  For thou speak'st with a celestial tongue  Let me embrace theeO pardon me too  That I assail'd thee with the threat of death  When thou but meant to save me from his shaft  For O thy words were welcome to my soul  As mollient dews that fall upon the mead  When parching Sol has curl'd each verdant blade  Thou hast preserv'd to me the dearest rose  That ever scented gale the sweetest bud  That ever eye beheld or tempted death to kill  This drooping fair one and her smiling boy  For they have suffer'd more than I dare tell  And to repeat is more than I can bear  She once alas was Fortune's favourite  And Minerva's pride the tender fondling  Of a wealthy pairO sad remembrance  Provoking tears when will ye cease to flow  These eyes have long been strangers to a smile  Excuse me friend if they disgust thee  We sing of others woe but cry our own  My heart has gushed at a thousand veins  To see the sufferings of a matchless wife  There was a time when this forsaken hold  At such an hour would have giv'n delight  When solitude and night would give a scop  To thought and yield a pleasing melancholy  To the jaded mind o'ercharg'd with pleasure  And variety but now how dreary and forlorn  It seems and as we tell our mournful tale  With double horror echoes back each word  Mocking adversity in hollow sounds  Telling us over what is death to hear  Such tales as mine good friend I oft have read  Such woeful scenes have oft been play'd  With sympathizing heart I've heard and seen  And dropp'd a tear for the oppress'd and brave  But ere I'd slept the fiction fled my breast  And time would leave no traces on the mind  When we become the objects of distress  Remembrance stamps it with an iron seal  Upon our hearts and ev'ry thought is death  But to my story 'tis my friend's desire  I am no stranger to this gloomy pile  I oft have paid a visit to these walls  And oft admir'd the romantic form  When the fair morn invited me abroad  When fertile nature dasy'd ev'ry hill  And ev'ry meadow blush'd a purple hue  When thrushes sang and linnets charm'd the grove  My heart then drank in pleasure at my eyes  And felt no interrupter by the way  No wretched thought to dash it back again  My father was a man of wealth and note  And held a mansion in a village by  A better ne'er gave being to a son  I having read of mighty things abroad  Of ancient Rome and grand Cairo's court  The wealth of India and Egyptian wilds  With thirst for novelty and desire  I urg'd my father and at length prevail'd  That he would let me venture on a tour  And prove the truth of hist'ry and report  'Tis six years since I left my native home  Since when so many wonders I have seen  That curiosity at last grew sick  Returning home I cross'd the mighty Alps  A deadly sickness seiz'd me on the way  And made me seek for succour and a friend  A greater rarity than all I'd met  An ample dwelling open'd to my view  To which I bent my way and shelter ask'd  And was receiv'd at once a welcome guest  With mild compassion they beheld my state  And strove to chear me with a friendly voice  Dismounting here I would have enter'd in  But that my feet their wonted use deny'd  My limbs gave way and let me to the ground  When this dear fair came running to my aid  She rais'd me up and led me careful in  And ev'ry day a true attendance paid  When I was struggling with the pangs of death  And with consoling hope she'd drop a tear  Imploring heaven to preserve my life  Her supplications did at length prevail  No sooner had I conquer'd one compeer  But found my heart was with another ta'en  Love to whom I soon submitted and embrac'd  And made my hostess partner of my life  But here partaker in affliction too  Her father was a Briton once of wealth  And held a mansion in that happy isle  Till revolution and domestic broils  Destroy'd his lands and plunder'd all he had  Save a few stores in fecret he had saved  Putting himself and family to flight  To seek for refuge in a foreign land  The action robb'd the good man of his life  And in distress the mournful widow left  With this fair comforter to buffet life  And shield her from a base ensnaring world  Here eighteen months I liv'd in social joy  And in the desert found the dearest wife  The kindest mother ever man cou'd boast  Her better spirits so outworn by grief  That made her frame like frozen lillies fade  Recline and droop unto the earth again  Not having heard one tiding from my friends  For many a day then we for England made  And ere we reach'd the shore the wind blew high  And frowning Neptune on the surface foam'd  Throwing up wat'ry mountains in our way  And in his anger dash'd us on a rock  Some twenty perish'd in the yawning deep  But we escap'd to meet a harder fate  We sav'd our lives but saw our cargo sink  No sooner had I stepp'd with pleasure on the shore  But met the tidings of my father's death  From one misfortune often comes a crowd  For some malignant enemy of mine  Inform'd the good old man I'd long been dead  And ere he died he chose another heir  And left him all his fortune and estate  Here each glaring circumstance arose  And fill'd me with surprise I ask'd his name  "Landore he cry'd a wealthy neighbour here"  Landore ye mighty Gods how just  I am that heir thy worthy father chose  And for his friendship and his love to me  I'll give his son his fortune back again  I had enough before to make me happy  And but resign that superflux to him  Which fate had chosen me steward to a while  To quit my claim upon a just demand  EPIGRAM ON LORD G  MY Lord has often said he scorns  The wretch who'd fain conceal his horns  And from his heart quite full of glee  He wish'd all cuckolds in the sea  A merry wag pleas'd with the whim  Reply'd my Lord  Pray can you swim  END OF VOL I
