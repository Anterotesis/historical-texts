COUNT OF ALTINA to the DUKE OF ARANDINA  DON JOHN  BEING ambitious of an alliance with the illustrious house of Arandina I propose myself the honour of waiting on your in a few  days for the purpose of soliciting the hand of the Lady Isabella your niece Her birth and charms will adorn any station and will ever be justly prized by him who is with esteem and respect  Yours c DON FELIX COUNT OF ALTINA  LETTER XLVII  DUKE OF ARANDINA in reply  DON FELIX  I SHALL never esteem the house of Arandina degraded by a connection with that of Altina Your  proposal will certainly be approved by my niece since it has met the approbation of him who is  Yours faithfully DON JOHN DUKE OF ARANDINA  LETTER XLVIII  DONNA ISABELLA to DONNA LAURA  EACH day that dawns on me is attended by some new wo This morning the Duke sent for me and addressed me in the following  words "You have been in danger of degrading yourself by a marriage with a vile fellowwho if he has his deserts will spend the remainder of his days in the mines  "As a punishment  you  were condemned to pass the remainder of  your  days in a convent's solitary gloom But a brighter prospect now discloses itself to your view The Count of Altina has notified his ambition to be allied to the house of Arandina His family though not of the  first  class is ancient and noble He will be here in a few daysPrepare therefore to receive your destined Lord"  SCARCELY had the Duke ceased to speak when I sunk motionless at his feet This accident he attributed to excess of joy and in that mistake did he continue till about an hour ago when the receipt of the inclosed letter undeceived him  DON JOHN  You will not I trust attribute my conduct to so contemptible a vice as ingratitude when I solicit the execution of my former sentence in preference to my becoming Countess of Altina As the misfortunes of my parents early determined me never to marry I flattered myself that beneath this roof I should be  sheltered from the storms of fortune and that when age with its concomitant infirmities should attack my benefactor I might by unremitting attention to the preservation of his health and by anticipating all his wishes express my gratitude for his past goodness in protecting a helpless orphan But since he no longer esteems me worthy of his protection I will now retire to that cloister whence his goodness called me and will there offer up daily prayers for his happiness In this manner do I mean to spend the remainder of a life which had it not been for your goodness might have been passed in penury and want  You will I trust pardon my refusal of the Count Altina's hand A refusal which it would not have been in my power to give had I not had the honour to be connected with you as the small stock of merit which I possess would never have been sufficient to procure me the notice of a Spanish grandee I remain  My Lord  With the greatest respect And gratitude Your much obliged niece And very humble servant ISABELLA DELLA VILLAREA  I WAITED with anxiety for his answer which arrived in about an hour and was as follows  ISABELLA  SINCE your folly leads you to prefer a cloister to a palace a life of perpetual mortification to one of gaiety and pleasure I grant your request and permit you to retire to Ventina I shall not force you to marry as no marriage however splendid can increase the lustre of the house of Arandina  THUS O Laura is my fate determined and I now fly for refuge to those very walls which I so lately  wished to shun But whilst  Alonzo  possesses the  heart Altina  shall never obtain the  hand  of  Your ISABELLA  LFTTERR XLIX  DUKE OF ARANDINA to the COUNT OF ALTINA  DON FELIX  SINCE I last wrote my sentiments are changed and you will never boast an alliance with the house of Arandina I remain  Yours DON JOHN DUKE OF ARANDINA  LETTER L  FATHER ALBERTO to DONNA LAURA  POOR Isabella's sufferings increase daily You know that she has refused the Count of Altina and that she is now condemned  without hopes of a reprieve to pass her days in the convent of Ventina Her conduct has been highly proper in refusing to marry Altina when her hand only was at her disposal I endeavour to comfort her as much as possible and to support her in all her distresses That she may receive from Heaven that support which she so much needs shall be the constant prayer of her afflicted friend  SHE is to be with you in about three weeks I think with pleasure that amidst all her distresses Heaven has spared so amiable and so real a friend as she has ever found in you I  wondered much that the Duke so readily gave up all thoughts of marrying her to Altina But it seems he did not think it consistent with his  dignity  to  force  her consent as  that  he said would have appeared as if the match was an object of importance to his familynow said he there is no family by a connection with which the house of Arandina would receive additional lustre  THUS for once has poor Isabella been benefited by that pride which has been the source of her  own  and her  parents  wo Heaven support her poor girl I must go  and comfort her I hear her weeping in the next room I remain as usual  Yours c ALBERTO  LETTER LI  DON ALONZO to DONNA ISABELLA DELLA VILLAREA  I AM so uneasy at not hearing from you and at the report of your approaching nuptials with the  Count of Altina as cannot well be conceived Not that I suppose Isabella would bestow her hand on Altina unless she were compelled by that tyrant her uncle who is indebted to her for the life which he now possesses I will not say  enjoys  as it is impossible that such a tyrant should find enjoyment in any thing but in torturing those whom fortune has subjected to him Do let me know how you are I fear you are still an invalid For mercy's sake write without delay All I ask is to be told that you are well and happy for if such is the lot of Isabella Alonzo will be  content to suffer Adieu Believe me  Ever yours c ALONZO  LETTER LII  DONNA ISABELLA to DON ALONZO  I HAVE been so ill that I could not hold a pen but thank Heaven am now a little betterI have refused the Count of Altina  and the matter is no more thought of I am too weak to add more than that I am  Yours sincerely ISABELLA  LETTER LIII  DONNA LAURA to DONNA ISABELLA  HOW my heart bleeds for dear Isabella oh how I pity and admire her You have indeed acted  nobly You will at once possess the pity and the respect of those who shall become acquainted with your sad tale Next week I shall cease to rank Isabella amongst the number of my  correspondents  she shall ever possess the first place in the catalogue of my  friends  That you may within these walls experience peace is all which I can hope for happiness will I fear never prove the lot of my friend on this side the grave But rest assured that such distinguished virtue as adorns Isabella will in a  future  state meet that reward which Heaven often for a time withholds  but never in the end refuses  WHEN our prospects in this world are overshadowed with impenetrable gloom it is at once our interest and our duty to contemplate with the eye of hope the bright prospects of a future state There the virtuous will experience bliss unalloyed their pleasure will be heightened by the remembrance of past sufferings whilst the contemplations of those bright scenes will not fail in some degree to gild the horrors of our present situation  THAT Isabella may experience the truth of these assertions is the sincerest with of her  Affectionate LAURA  LETTER LIV  DONNA ISABELLA to DONNA LAURA  I HAVE just received Laura's kind letter I am much indebted to it for the small share of tranquillity  I now enjoy Small indeed is the portion of happiness which I ever possessed but it was more than I deserved This morning I shall consecrate to the melancholy employment of bidding adieu to several old friends I think I hear you express your astonishment at the term as you have always esteemed poor Isabella a friendless and deserted orphan and such she is But the friends to whom I must now bid adieu are the venerable oaks which surround these ancient walls those oaks which have for ages sheltered beneath their branches the ancestors of her who is now to bid them an  eternal  adieu  I feel a regret at parting with them that may to you appear weak and childish and perhaps is so But when I reflect that through the whole course of my misfortunes they have received me under their shade that they have never censured my imprudence and have even appeared to express their sympathy with my sufferings by solemn wavings of their aged arms my sorrow at leaving them is great But to what an excess of weakness does my grief lead me Whither am I running With what nonsense am I pestering Laura Adieu I can no longer restrain my tears Wretched as I am I can never be  completely  so till deprived of your friendship I will write once more before I bid an eternal adieu to dear Villarea  LETTER LV  DONNA ISABELLA to DON ALONZO  I AM thank Heaven so much recovered as to propose making an excursion of some miles When I shall return to Villarea I  know not but whenever I do I will write you a longer letter I only scribble this left hearing of my departure from any other than myself you should imagine that I had forgotten those obligations which will be remembered with eternal gratitude by  ISABELLA  LETTER LVI  DONNA ISABELLA to DONNA LAURA DE CASSILDINA  AS a few days will now terminate our correspondence I cannot permit the arrival of that period  without expressing my gratitude for the comfort I have ever experienced in the perusal of Laura's letters As I am now to enjoy the  conversation  of my kind benefactress for such I shall ever esteem you I have at the request of that amiable man Father Alberto deposited in his hands all your letters as well as copies of all that I ever wrote to you Those of Alonzo he has obtained from the Duke He says that when we are parted he shall enjoy a melancholy pleasure in perusing the letters which contain a sketch of my misfortunes Oh how truly amiable he is How I shall  regret his loss I which however will in some degree be compensated by his correspondence and he likewise assures me that no year shall elapse without his visiting the convent of Ventina  I HAVE just been visiting the apartment which was allotted to my father when he was an inhabitant of this Castle I could not refrain from tears Indeed I never visit that apartment without weeping as the train of ideas which rush into my mind at the sight of it are very melancholy indeed Oh how often have I wept when the good old  woman that nursed him has described him to me She speaks of him with rapture and mingles her tears with mine good creature She has never ceased to weep since the news of my departure was known Oh Laura what do I not suffer  OH Heaven look down with pity and when it shall please thee terminate by death the woes of a wretch to whom life is a heavy burden a burden however which she hopes to bear with becoming patience till time shall being the longexpected hour of relief Adieu  my dear Laura may happiness be still  your  lot it never more on be the lot of  ISABELLA  LETTER LVIII  DONNA ISABELLA to FATHER ALBERTO  Convent of Ventina  YESTERDAY I entered these walls and I blush to own that when the iron gate grating on  its hinges closed with apparent reluctance I wept Not even the appearance of Laura who flew to embrace me was sufficient to support my drooping spirits I instantly retired to her apartment and there I remained till the hour of rest Laura endeavoured to sooth my agitated soul but in vain for I have never ceased to weep since my arrival Oh what I felt when in passing through the saloon I found it filled with weeping domestics To see the poor old woman that had nursed my father wringing her hands in an agony of despair and tearing those venerable locks that were silvered by the hand of time  Oh it was too much who could bear it And when I was entering the carriage the poor old housedog licked my hand and gave a short howl as if he knew that I was wretched and pitied me Oh what I suffered when you waved your hand from the battlements and bid me adieu in all the silent agony of wo Oh God it was too much At our sad parting the conscious heavens wept all nature seemed overcast with melancholy gloom Ah no not  nature  but my  heart  was sad and when all  within  is dark and gloomy nought  external  will show bright If this be true and true it is never shall  I again behold the laughing fields or the frant groves in the gay livery of spring to me they will be ever overcast I am wretched indeed but I must submit to the will of Heaven Remember me kindly to poor old nurse and do not forget the disconsolate  ISABELLA  LETTER LIX  DONNA ISABELLA to DON ALONZO  I MUST begin this letter with imploring your forgiveness of the deceit which I have practised on  you but I was unwilling that you should be acquainted with my intention of retiring to this sad retreat till it should be too late to prevent it as I dreaded the force of your attachment to me unworthy as I am might hurry you into the commission of some violence which would have involved both of us in fresh difficulties When you have heard the motives that influenced you will I trust approve the conduct of Isabella My uncle gave me the choice of two  evils  and I have chosen what to me appeared the least I was necessitated either to marry Altina or to retire to this convent My reasons for preferring  the latter were two The  first  that I scorn so far to injure any man as to yield my  hand  to his solicitation when my  heart  was devoted to another The  second  that I imagined you would suffer much less from seeing me for ever secluded from the world than from seeing me the property of another Indeed had I become Countess of Altina I could not consistently with the dictates of honour or of virtue have fulfilled my promise of corresponding with you a promise which I made merely to preserve the life of my uncle as I dreaded the effects of unappeased anger Had I not been influenced by so weighty a reason I never would  have granted a request the compliance with which will certainly tend to embitter the remainder of our respective lives as well as constantly call to our remembrance and perhaps greatly increase an unhappy passion which can never now be gratisied for whenever the year of probation shall expire I must assume the veil and bind myself by the most solemn vows to consecrate to Heaven the remainder of a life that has indeed been wretched If you wish to regain that peace you have lost and not to embitter the remainder of my days you will release me from my promise if you are so blinded by your passion as to insist on its performance you  shall find that the laws of honour will never be violated by me  DIRECT your answer to me at the convent of Ventina but do not solicit an interview as that will never be granted by her who is with great regard  Your obliged friend And sincere well wisher ISABELLA DELLA VILLAREA  LETTER LX  DON ALONZO to DONNA ISABELLA DELLA VILLAREA  OH Isabella how have you deceived me Was this the excursion you so slightly mentioned in  your last letter You are indeed ignorant when you are to revisit Villarea Had you entertained for Alonzo that regard you prosess towards him you would have imitated the conduct of your heroic mother you would have blessed Alonzo with your hand He would have asked from Heaven no other boon he would have supported in affluence he would have adored Isabella He does adore her he ever  must  adore her But why so obstinately cruel why regret that she is bound by honour to correspond with Alonzo why mention that favour as the the price of her uncle's life Her commands will alone be sufficient to  prevent Alonzo from terminating the existence of such a monster But why am I never more to behold the amiable Isabella Why am I doomed to perpetual misery Oh Isabella 'tis to the pride of your uncle and to the cold insensibitity of your friend that I am indebted for my misfortunes  I AM called to Madrid by business of importance that will detain me about a week and when I return I will attempt to obtain at least  one  interview with Isabella If the attempt be not crowned with success I shall meet my fate without dread  as my sufferings cannot now be heightened  I am as much as ever  Your devoted slave ALONZO DE CASTINA  LETTER LXI  FATHER ALBERTO to DONNA ISABELLA  My dear child  I WAS as you observed greatly affected by your departure and do not wonder that you were as much so  but I trust that the bitter scene once past you will become every day more calm and that your grief will be moderated by time You are undoubtedly a great object of pity I never knew a greater but still amidst all your distresses you will find great consolation by reflecting on your retiring from the world so early for believe me we are better calculated to struggle with misfortune in youth than in age At the first dawn of life the world is tolerable because it is novel but in the evening of our day for the life of man when compared with eternity is no more when life has lost its only charm of novelty the anchor  of hope unless it rest beyond die grave proves but a slight support to the being who oppressed with misfortune relies on it alone for comfort and for happiness  YOUR uncle sets out for Madrid tomorrow having received a sudden and unexpected call to court He proposes writing to you on his return I am to accompany him to the capital where he says our stay is to be short I am sorry to hear that the Count of Altina is much displeased with your uncle's conduct not so much by his refusal as by the manner of it he has I hear vowed to be revenged but I trust  he will not put his threats in execution  I INTREATED your uncle to send a less haughty refusal but all I said was in vain he was determined to support the dignity of the house of Arandina by insolence  not  only to his  inferiors  but to  those  who are  nearly  his  equals  I HOPE he will not have cause to repent his rejecting my counsel Adieu dear girl you shall at all times command the prayers of  ALBERTO  LETTER LXII  DONNA ISABELLA in reply  TEN thousand thanks for your kind letter It found me in my cell drowned in tears and lamenting  a destiny which is indeed severe but I am grateful to heaven for the comfort I receive in your friendship and that of my Laura and I hope that time aided by religion will calm my transports and soothe my anguish  I HAVE written to Alonzo informing him of my return and the motives that induced me to prefer it to the hand of Altina He seems much disatisfied with my conduct and even accuses me of treachery but he will I trust in the calm moments of reflection approve the conduct of Isabella I trust my uncle will not feel the effects of Altina's  vengeance I alas cannot avert them as I did those of the injured Alonzo I have no other heart to offer as a bribe and if I  had  Altina would not esteem the atonement to his injured honour sufficient How fatal to repose are the effects of pride The truth of this assertion is proved by every page of my sad tale Pride has been the source of all my parents' wo and of my own Had my uncle not been proud Isabella had never been wretched or at least not so wretched as she now is But what am I saying am I not censuring the conduct of my uncle and in so doing am I not to blame I may in private lament  but I must not even to you mention the errors of one whose protection I once enjoyed though now I can alas rank it amongst the blessings possesed by your afflicted  ISABELLA  LETTER LXIII  FATHER ALBERTO to DONNA ISABELLA  SCARCE had I finished the perusal of your last where you observe how fatal to happiness are  the effects of pride when the Duke was brought home in the arms of two servants covered with wounds and blood He was followed by Alonzo who was also wounded but not so severely When the Duke was placed on a couch and the surgeons had dressed his wounds Alonzo addressed him in the following words "Learn Don John from this night's adventure that a man may act with  honour  though his  ancestors  were not  ennobled  " On saying these words he retired to his own house attended by the surgeons who have declared that  he  is not in any danger About the  Duke  they art still doubtful but I hope the best  FROM Alonzo whom I this day visited I learned the following account of the adventure As the Duke was returning home in his coach he passed through a retired street where the carriage was attacked by three Villains armed with daggers They ordered the coachman to stop instantly The Duke on hearing their voices and seeing them attempt to force open the door of the carriage opened the door on the oposite side and jumped out He then set his back against a wall and throwing his cloke over his left arm  stood on his defence He was instantly attacked by the ruffians who wounded him desperately his lackeys having in the mean time run off leaving their master to be assassinated Whilst the Duke was engaged in this unequal contest Alonzo happened to pass that way He easily recognized the person who was calling loudly for assistance and without delay stabbed two of the villains who instantly fell whilst the other is secured and has confessed that he was hired by the Count of Altina to murder the DukeYou Isabella refused to bestow your hand on one man when your heart was the property of another  Heaven has you see rewarded you by delivering you from being united to a man who is in fact an assassin A character alas too common in Spain The Duke's misfortune has not produced the least change in his sentiments I flattered myself that the person to whom he owed his life might have been rewarded with the hand of Isabella but on my suggesting the matter to him he was much enraged and said "that he would rather have experienced a still more hateful death than have his life prolonged only to behold the disgrace of his family A family that will soon be extinct and of which it may then be said that during  a course of nine hundred years it has retained its nobility uncontaminated As to the young man continued he who assisted me in dispatching those villains I shall reward him in a manner becoming his station by bestowing on him a large sum of money a reward much fitter for a merchant than an illustrious wife"How Alonzo will bear this fresh insult I know not but as he is strongly attached to you I trust you will be able to pacify his just resentment  I FLATTER myself that you are now somewhat more composed than when you last wrote and that the  hours pass less heavily than they did  I SHALL write again in a day or two Till then believe me  Yours ever affectionately ALBERTO  LETTER LXIV  DONNA ISABELLA to DON ALONZO DE CASTINA  GENEROUS Alonzo to risk your own life in the preservation of him who has so grossly insulted  and so seriously injured you Receive the thanks of Isabella A reward which though greatly inadequate to your deserts is all that she has left to bestow Her heart has long been yours and if her hand were at her own disposal it should soon be added but she is not mistress of her hand and she fears that the only person who has a right to influence her in the disposal of it will never consent to her bestowing it on one who prizes it too highly  I FLATTERED myself that the important service you have rendered  the Duke might have been deemed by him a just claim to more valuable marks of his favour than the hand of a poor orphan who has no ambition but to be virtuous and who were she at her own disposal would imitate her mother's conduct and prefer Alonzo to the most illustrious grandee of Spain But alas Alberto informs me that there are no hopes of any change in his sentiments on this head Do write to me whenever your wounds will admit of it but not before I am happy to hear that the wounds you have received are only slight Father Alberto is to send me a regular  account of your health for the recovery of which none will be so anxious as  ISABELLA  LETTER LXV  DON ALONZO to DONNA ISABELLA DELLA VILLAREA  MY wounds are so well recovered as to admit of my addressing the amiable benefactress to  whom I am indebted for the prolongation of that life which I have lately risked in her service for such I esteem to have been the preservation of her uncle from the daggers of assassins It was not for the Duke of Arandina I drew my sword it was for a fellowcreature and for the uncle of Isabella Considered in either of  these  capacities he had a right to my  assistance  as Duke of Arandina he had  every  thing to  fear  and  nothing  to  hope  from Alonzo But I have just received from him a fresh insult of such a nature that it should not go unrevenged an hour if he were not connected with you He has sent me a considerable sum  of money as a reward for the service I rendered him Can you wonder if this treatment provokes me to the last degree I have returned the money with the utmost contempt advising him at the same time not to impose any  fresh  task on the forbearance of one whose patience is almost exhausted Oh Isabella why are you so rigid in your notions of duty Is he a parent is he a friend is he a protector No he is your sole torment Yes he is the source of all the misfortunes that have befallen yourself and family and yet he is to experience from Isabella all that obedience and respect which could only be due to an indulgent  father Oh do not drive me by your preposterous notions of duty into perpetual exile and that will be my lot if you refuse to quit those hated walls which now seclude you from die sight of the wretched  ALONZO  LETTER LXVI  DONNA ISABELLA to DON ALONZO DE CASTINA  WHY does Alonzo reproach me with cruelty which was never reckoned among Isabella's  faults by those who knew her  You  are indeed cruel to threaten me with retiring to a perpetual banishment if I refuse to violate the laws of duty If I had no uncle to controul me I would as before I told you without a moment's hesitation bestow my hand on Alonzo but I have ever been accustomed to consider the Duke as a parent and as such shall ever conduct myself towards him Do not press me to act in a manner that would subject me to the censure of all who know me do not Alonzo require from me so  fatal  a proof of my affection  Every  proof consistent with  duty  you  may expect do not solicit  others  from her who is with gratitude and sincerity  Yours affectionately ISABELLA  LETTER LXVII  FATHER ALBERTO to DONNA ISABELLA  THE Duke is now so well recovered as to propose setting out for Villarea tomorrow Alanzo  has informed you he tells me of the new affront which the Duke has offered him and at your request he has promised not to resent it I pity you both sincerely You were formed for each other and yet I fear will never be united It is not in my power to relieve you Oh that it were Isabella should never then shed another tear But we must submit to the will of Heaven and comfort ourselves with reflecting that this life will not prove eternal that there is an hereafter and that  there  the virtuous must be happy  ADIEU dear Isabella I will write as soon as we reach Villarea Till then believe me  Ever yours ALBERTO  LETTER LXVIII  DON ALONZO to DONNA ISABELLA  I HAVE received your last I was going to call it your cruel letter but I must submit to my fate I must  be sacrificed to your ideas of duty and must contemplate the destruction of all my hopes You will not I trust refuse the last request I shall ever make you and  that  is tomorrow to bless me with an interview If you will have the goodness to grant this you shall never more be persecuted by the wretched  ALONZO  LETTER LXIX  DONNA ISABELLA to DON ALONZO  THOUGH I think it highly imprudent in me to grant your request as an interview will only  increase our misery yet at twelve tomorrow you will be expected by the wretched  ISABELLA  LETTER LXX  DONNA ISABELLA to FATHER ALBERTO  TIS past the worst is now over I have just bid an eternal adieu to Alonzo Oh the  scene was dreadful Twice I fainted and twice the cruel friendship of Laura recalled me to life and to wo He is gone never will Isabella behold him more May Heaven protect him He is quite in despair He accuses me Yet what could I do I am indeed wretched Do visit Alonzo and try to soothe him I am so distracted with agony I can write no more Do write to me Teach me to submit without repining to the will of Providence teach me to bear life a heavy load I have found it  ADIEU Oh my heart how it beats sure it will break Oh Heaven support me 'tis too much Once more adieu  ISABELLA DELLA VILLAREA  LETTER LXXI  DON ALONZO to DONNA ISABELLA DELLA VILLAREA  TOMORROW will Alonzo bid an eternal adieu to Spain but not to misery That will be his lot  wherever he goes that has been his lot ever since the appearance of Isabella preserved his life Exiled by your cruelty I have procured an appointment in New Spain and tomorrow I am to embark As the ship in which I sail now lies off that part of the shore where stand Ventina's hatedwalls the last object which I shall contemplate in Old Spain willbe the prison of Isabella and may the grave of Alonzo be the first object I behold in New Spain What have I not suffered since our parting It is now two long months since I have seen or even heard from Isabella Did I not promise to terminate our correspondence  I will never write again and you cannot reproach me with breach of promise For oh heaven We never more shall meet The thought distracts me Farewell a sad farewell to the brightest ornament of the sex to cruel Isabella who dooms to perpetual misery the wretched youth that adores her Adieu may you whilst exile and misery are the lot of Alonzo experience every earthly happiness Oh Isabella you have for ever destroyed the peace of the wretched  ALONZO  LETTER LXXII  THE LADY ABBESS OF VENTINA to FATHER ALBERTO  REVEREND FATHER  YOU will not experience more pain in the perusal of this mournful letter than I shall in writing  it for it is with unseigned grief that I communicate to you the dreadful intelligence  THREE nights ago this convent was near being reduced to ashes by the heedlessness of a servant who neglected to extinguish the fire of the kitchen before she went to rest About eleven at night I was alarmed by the cry of fire and as soon as I had left my apartment I found that owing to the violence of the wind which then blew high the flames had made a considerable progress I ordered the doors to be instantly thrown open and advised every one  to secure herself by flight an advice which was followed by all but the amiable girl who was so lately added to our society After we had retired to a neighbouring church I inquired if all the sisterhood were there in safety and was shocked to find that she was still missing I instantly returned to the convent where I found the flames still raging with the utmost violence notwithstanding every attempt to extinguish them but in vain I endeavoured to learn any thing concerning the lovely Isebella You will easily conceive what must have been my feelings The next morning however I received  the melancholy information that she was seen after we had quitted the convent lying at the foot of the altar but the confusion was so great that no one was sufficiently recollected to render her the least assistance and as that part of the chapel was totally destroyed there is alas no room to doubt that she perished in the flames All attempts to discover even the least remains of the dear girl have proved totally ineffectual You will do me the justice to believe that amongst all the fatal consequences of this sad catastrophe the loss of that dear girl most deeply affects her who is with sincere  respect for your character and with the greatest pity for your misfortune  Your faithful friend And servant HENRIETTA MENDOZA  Lady Abbess of the Convent of Ventina  LETTER LXIII  FATHER ALBERTO to HENRIETTA ABBESS OF VENTINA  DONNA HENRIETTA  THOUGH misfortune has been through life my lot though I have been accustomed to suffer  I own the news you have communicated to me has affected me beyond description I have never ceased to weep since the perusal of your sad letter As soon as I was a little recovered from the astonishment it had occasioned me I laid your letter before the Duke who condoles with you on your loss and who bears his own otherwise than I expected He has ordered a monument to be erected to her memory in the family mausoleum and an inscription to be engraved mentioning her descent and the misfortune that occasioned her evertobe lamented death  I REMAIN Madam with respect esteem and pity for your misfortune  Your faithful servant and sincere wellwisher ALBERTO  LETTER LXXIV  DONNA LAURA to FATHER ALBERTO  YOU alas are too well acquainted with the sad tale to need any fresh information on the  subject O Alberto why was Isabella wretched why did she who merited so much never possess a moment's happiness Never shall I behold her more Dear amiable girl possessed of every human virtue she is gone to join her sister seraphs in the realms of day How selfish is it in me thus to lament her fate Happiness was never her lot on earth but now it is hers beyond the reach of wo Not the least remains of our gentle friend have escaped the ravages of the fire and I have the melancholy reflection that her sacred ashes are now trampled underfoot by the clowns who are repairing the convent Happily for me  Isabella's apartment is destroyed so that I shall not have my grief heightened if that be possible by contemplating the cell where she wept For to that sad employment alone did she consecrate her hours since her quitting Villarea  JUST heaven for heaven still is just what do I not suffer Is there no spot on this vast globe that will afford to mortals a retreat secure from wo I have sought repose in vain I who have spent my whole life within Ventina's now desolated walls secluded from that world which has proved so fatal to the repose of my dear my evertobe lamented  friend am now completely wretched I have now no source of comfort but the certainty of death  that  once past and Isabella will again be mine That Heaven may  accelerate  the arrival of that wishedfor hour shall be the constant prayer of one who is with sincere regard  Yours assuredly LAURA DE CASSILDINA  "You will have the kindness to address your answer to me at the Convent of Bellmata as there we are received till our own be repaired"  LETTER LXXV  FATHER ALBERTO to DONNA LAURA  YOUR melancholy letter arrived here this evening and as I am a fellowsufferer with you  you will easily believe how sincerely I sympathise with you on your loss The sad catastrophe as you observed affects only those friends who are perhaps for years to lament the fate of the dear Isabella You have indeed sustained a loss in some respects severer than mine as I was from the moment she quitted Villarea deprived of her sweet society Yet I should have had the pleasure of her correspondence But she is now happy her sorrows are no more all her cares are past and she is now receiving that reward her distinguished virtue claimed  I WILL not however by dwelling on the merits of her who is now at peace add to the distress of her amiable friend But I cannot lay down my pen without informing you of the manner in which the Duke received the news of her death After perusing the fatal letter  She has not said he disgraced her family and shall therefore have a monument erected to her memory in the buryingplace of the Dukes of Arandina You said he shall draw up an inscription for the monument but do not mention the names of her parents only say that she was niece to Don John  twentieth Duke of Arandina c c  THUS was he  afficted  by her death and since that time he has never mentioned her name though I do not so much wonder at his conduct as his pride now nearly approaches to madness and if his life be spared much longer I have just reason to apprehend a total loss of his reason A punishment  that  which Heaven often inflicts on those who are so haughty as is the poor Duke  WISHING that you may enjoy all the happiness of which you are now capable I remain Madam with respect and esteem  Your afflicted friend ALBERTO  LETTER LXXVI  DON ALONZO DE CASTINA to FATHER ALBERTO  THE happiest of beings has now the pleasure to address you and to inform you that Isabella  whom you doubtless consider as no more is in perfect health in New Spain To explain this mystery you must know that after I had embarked for that country whence I never thought to return I found it would be impossible to sail till one in the morning On receiving this intelligence I got into a boat and went on shore to contemplate for the last time those hated walls that deprived me of Isabella As the convent is you know almost close to the shore I soon found myself there and desiring the men to wait a little I quitted them to indulge myself in walking round the walls of the garden But as I was going to  return to the boat observing the convent in flames and the doors thrown wide open I instantly flew to the gate and passed unobserved through the crowd of nuns who were rushing out and who were too much engaged by attention to their own preservation even to observe me As I knew that my Isabella had not yet assumed the conventual dress I was sure she had not escaped me in the crowd I flew therefore to that part of the convent where she resided and as I passed through the chapel I observed a female prostrate at the foot of the altar who on a nearer approach proved to be that dear angel  who had fallen down in a swoon and lay there without any signs of life I however lost no time but catching the lovely burden in my arms bore her still senseless to the boat that waited for me which as the nuns had all fled the other way I reached totally unobserved No sooner had I placed her in the boat than I tried every possible means to restore her but to no purpose My agonies were now inconceivable but I still continued my endeavours and after rowing about thirteen minutes we reached the vessel which was just going to hoist sail The Captain who had observed the fire easily guessed whence  I had stolen so invaluable a treasure and objected to receiving her for fear of consequences till observing that she had not the dress of a nun at my earnest entreaties he consented to receive the dear girl who now to my inexpressible joy began to discover signs of life As soon as we were on board the vessel got under way whilst I conveyed Isabella into the great cabin where she was soon restored owing to the kindness of a lady who with her husband was going to New Spain As soon as she recovered and learned her situation she instantly relapsed and it was with difficulty that she was the second time restored at all When  she came to herself I informed her of the situation in which I had found her and that had I not arrived at the instant I did she must have perished in the flames as every one had fled and left her to meet her fate She in  time  became more reconciled to her situation but at  first  she earnestly intreated to be put on shore This however the Captain assured her was impossible as the ship run nine notes in the hour and our distance was then near twenty miles from the shores of Spain She expressed her gratitude to me for preserving her life but regretted that I had taken advantage of the general confusion to elope with her  I pleaded only in my defence that I was human and that no man could have neglected to embrace so heavenborn an opportunity of possessing all he held dear on earth But answered she my uncle will always suspect that mine was a  voluntary  escape and will never pardon me Nay perhaps good Alberto may even suspect me and here she wept bitterly If Laura still live Heaven grant she do every she may suspect Isabella I assured her that those who knew Isabella would never suppose her capable of acting but as an angel would do were it in her situation As to Laura I could only say that I  thought  she passed me in  the crowd which rushed out as I entered and that as I saw no one in the convent I hoped and believed she was safe In about a week I presumed to solicit the blessing of her hand exerted all the persuasion I was master of and with great difficulty prevailed on her to confer on me a reward that would have overpaid whole ages of misery As there was a priest on board who was also a passenger we were married and have now been here five months but no ship having failed since we arrived I could not sooner communicate to you the agreeable intelligence contained in this letter It is  almost superfluous to add that the happiest of beings is  Your faithful friend ALONZO DE CASTINA  ISABELLA begs to hear from you as soon as possible and requests you to state the case to the Duke whose pardon we solicit and whose commands we await with the greatest anxiety If he will pardon my rashness and permit me to pay my respects to him in person I shall esteem myself if possible happier than I now am Poor Isabella trembles at the mention of his name She would write to you but as  she has only time to write  one  letter before the packet sails she addresses  that  This letter was destroyed by the accident mentioned in the note p Vol I so that the Editor can satisfy the reader's curiosity concerning it no farther than by informing him that as a picture of what passed in the mind of Isabella it exhibited the most tender anxiety about the fate of Laura violent apprehensions of the Duke's resentment of the step she herself had taken in marrying the son of a merchant and an earnest desire to remove from the mind of her friend every suspicion that her elopement was voluntary The idea of being suspected to have gone off  willingly  with her lover seems to have greatly distressed her  to Laura but inclosed to you  so that if her friend is no more you will of course retain the letter She begs you would show this to Laura The letter is called for Once more adieu On your wellknown goodness we rely  LETTER LXXVII  FATHER ALBERTO to DONNA ISABELLA DE CASTINA  LITTLE did you know the heart of Alberto if you thought that when the heavenly news of your  escape reached him he would with all the insensibility of a Dutch professor of ethics proceed to inquire how far you were culpable in suffering yourself to be so delivered Far from making these inquiries I had no sooner read the letter than I burst into tears of joy of ecstacy and have never ceased since I heard the news to thank the Heaven that delivered you from death and from misery  IT is with regret I inform you that the Duke can never be made acquainted with the story of your escape as he has been for some  time delirious and all attempts to recal his banished reason have proved ineffectual This sad calamity was occasioned totally by his pride which of late became excessive indeed He is now attended by a medical man who never loses sight of him for an instant but who says he does not apprehend that his life will last long as his blood is in a horrid state  I WOULD wish you to return as soon as possible that should any thing happen you may be ready to claim your family possessions Poor man it is really dreadful to see how  his pride increases Even now he desires that no servant will present him any thing but on the knee and gives every day some fresh instance of growing arrogance He is indeed an object of pity and terror to all who see him Heaven restore him to reason before it call him hence  LAURA is as you will hear from herself in health and happy beyond conception to find  that Isabella living  over whom she had shed so many tears As she writes by this packet I shall now conclude with wishing that as much happiness may be the lot of Isabella as the  shortness of human life will admit Adieu dear child Believe me  Ever yours ALBERTO  TELL Alonzo I would have written to him also but you are now one  LETTER LXXVIII  DONNA LAURA to DONNA ISABELLA DE CASTINA  No sooner did I behold the wellknown hand of Isabella than I swooned for joy No sooner  was I recovered than I tore open the letter with the utmost anxiety I was so much affected by the contents that it was with difficulty I ever got through it I wept but it was from excess of joy Oh Isabella suspected you of having acted improperly No Joy so wholly occupies my breast that suspicion will find no admission and if it did at the name of  Isabella  it would vanish the charm would be too powerful for it Oh Isabella hasten to Old Spain I die with anxiety to embrace you  I HAVE read Alonzo's letter to Alberto and have sent yours to that  excellent man You are to receive from him an account of the Duke's misfortune Poor wretch cruel as he has been I pity him He is a sad instance of the melancholy effect of pride when carried to that dreadful length Happy had it been for him if all his ancestors had been honest peasants instead of illustrious Dukes The only effect that a long train of coroneted ancestry ought to produce in the mind of their representative is to encourage him in attempting to imitate the virtues of those illustrious men from whom he boasts his descent If it produce this effect a long train of ancestors may indeed be esteemed an important  advantage but if it be only considered as conserring on us a power of insulting those whose ancestors were unknown it may be justly esteemed a misfortune Of the truth of this assertion the poor Duke is too fatal an instance But I must conclude as Father Alberto has sent for my letter that he may inclose it with his Do write to me once more ere you enable me to assure you in  person  how sincerely I am  Your affectionate LAURA  ALL this appears to me like a dream That Isabella whose fate I have so often wept does she still live and stranger still is she happy  LETTER LXXIX  DONNA LAURA to FATHER ALBERTO  I HAVE been much questioned concerning Isabella's escape by all our sisterhood many of whom  now recollect having seen a young man rush into the convent the moment the doors were opened They all rejoice greatly that the dear angel has escaped and are very anxious to see her in Old Spain again They cannot however be  so  anxious as I am I believe there is not  one  here who supposes that Isabella even  knew  where she was till the ship had failed and if she did I do not think her conduct reprehensible The news of her escape has been much noised about and has every where occasioned much joy Several people who visited the convent have desired to see me though I was totally unknown to them merely that they  might congratulate me on the joyful news I now indeed am happy How unsearchable are the ways of Providence Had Isabella  not  returned to Ventina she would probably never have been the wife of Alonzo I remain with respect and esteem  Revered Father  Yours c LAURA DE CASSILDINA  LETTER LXXX  FATHER ALBERTO to DONNA LAURA  I WAS this day alarmed with a great noise issuing from the Duke's apartment I instantly went  to learn the reason of the tumult and the moment I entered the room perceived the Duke weltering in his blood The physician who attended him told me that he had left the Duke only an instant whilst he went to the next apartment to bring him some medicine and when he returned he found him in this horrid condition with a dagger in his hand which it seems he had procured but  how  I have not been able to discover When I arrived there were scarce any signs of life and in a few moments the Duke breathed his last Poor wretched man he is a sad instance of the fatal effects of pride  I HAVE ordered several hundred masses to be offered up for his soul that through the infinite mercy of the Almighty she may at last gain admission into the bright regions of eternal day where the vain distinctions of birth are unknown and where humility is preferred to elation of heart May his example warn others to shun those errors that embittered his  present  and clouded his  prospects  of a  future  life  BY his death Isabella succeeds to his enormous property which had she not escaped that fatal night would have devolved to the  Crown I have sent immediate intelligence to the Marchioness of Villarea for the dukedom being extinct that title devolves to the amiable Isabella and have in her name taken possession of the estate  THE Duke's funeral is fixed for tomorrow and as his rank was so high I have ordered it to be conducted in a pompous manner tho' alas I fear his spirit will receive little pleasure from the pomp with which his remains will be consigned to the grave where all distinction ceases You will not have an opportunity  of writing for some time if you neglect the present one I remain as usual  Yours ALBERTO  LETTER LXXXI  FATHER PEREZ to FATHER ALBERTO  REVEREND BROTHER  YESTERDAY a vessel from New Spain arrived here on board of which there was a lady of  distinction whose husband had been drowned in the course of the voyage and I was informed that she was in a very bad state On receiving this intelligence I as was my duty went on board the ship and found that the lady was of Villarea and that her only son an infant of nine months old was with her She was so weak as not to be able to speak and it was apprehended she could not survive many days I had her landed and placed in one of the best houses here where she is attended by the faculty of the place and they give me hopes that she may yet recover I learnt from one of her attendants that you are her  particular friend which has occasioned my informing you of her situation  I am Sir  Your loving brother PEREZ  LETTER LXXXII  FATHER ALBERTO to DONNA LAURA  I TOLD you in my last hurried scrawl that our Isabella was arrived in Spain and what misfortunes  had befallen her The instant I had scratched these few lines to you I set off for Cadiz and found the sad mourner in a very miserable state as you will suppose She had however recovered her strength so much as to be able to speak and showed great pleasure at my arrival She was in bed and appeared wan and much exhausted On a little couch near the bed lay a smiling insant that seems to inherit all its mother's charms She wept bitterly on my kissing the sweet babe and said it was all she had by which to remember her Alonzo It was about nine months old  and she has named it Frederick Alonzo  I HOPE God will support her in all her distresses of which Heaven has given her a large proportion Indeed I have never ceased to weep since I arrived here To see the mother hang in agony over her infant son to hear her sighs and to witness her sorrows is too much for me  OF poor amiable Alonzo's death I received the following account from one of her attendants After they had embarked for Old Spain  and were just out of the harbour Isabella recollected a casket containing the certificate of her marriage which she had left on shore Alonzo insisted on going to fetch it himself and got into a boat they were about this time two miles from shore Scarce had the boat got half way when a hurricane overset her all her crew perished and the ship was driven out to sea The hurricane continued for twelve hours during which time the ship was in the greatest danger of foundering When the hurricane subsided they found themselves far out at sea and the wind was so contrary that they  could not return to inquire if the corpse of Alonzo had been driven on shore for there were no hopes of his life being preserved as the hurricane was so violent that no one could gain the shore Poor Isabella was for a long time quite delirious and accused herself as the cause of his death I trust however that she will yet recover and that the young Alonzo will not be deprived of both his parents  SHE says whenever she is able to hold a pen she will write to you She sends her love to you and I must now lay down my  pen as the physicians are arrived and I always attend her when they come  I am as usual  Yours c ALBERTO  LETTER LXXII  FATHER ALBERTO to DONNA LAURA  I HAVE at length removed your Isabella hither She was much affected on her first arrival but time  will I trust reconcile her to the place The sight of the castle recalld to her memory many past transctions the meeting between her and the poor old nurse was truly affecting the good old woman wept in silence whilst Isabella emraced her with the greatest affection  HER arrival has made all the servants distracted with joy of which there never was so much in the Castle of Villarea But your friend herself is inconsolable for the death of Alonzo and will I fear soon follow him she is at present reduced to a mere sketeton She is ever grateful  for your letters  I presume the letters here mentioned were of no importance to the story as they it not in the collection How many months elapsed between the writing of the last letter and of that which follows it is impossible for the editor to determine as all those which may be supposed to hare passed between Alberto and Laara or between her and Isabella have been destroyed probably because they contained nothing essential to the completion of the narrative  and regrets that she cannot yet answer them  I remain with all esteem Yours c ALBERTO  LETTER LXXI  FATHER ALBERTO to DONNA LAURA  O LAURA what ecstacy will you feel at the perusal of this letter Yesterday as the Marchioness  and I were walking in the grove a figure approached us which so nearly resembled Alonzo that I started but on a nearer approach it proved to be that very Alonzo whose supposed death had nearly proved fatal to Isabella The interview as you will suppose was interesting in the extreme I will not attempt to describe it lest I should not do justice to such a scene Suffice it to say that pleasure now reigns unrivalled within these happy walls The escape of Alonzo was indeed nearly miraculous He alone of all the crew escaped by clinging to a plank and at length reached the shore nearly  dead with fatigue His sufferings during his absence from Isabella were doubtless of the severest nature Ignorant of her fate and Unable to acquaint her with his escape he embarked for Old Spain in the next fleet that failed and immediately oh his arrival wrote to me to prepare Isebella for his return but unhappily the letter never arrived  Unhappily  I say because the surprise had nearly proved fatal to Isabella  GOD grant that the happiness which this amiable couple now enjoy may henceforth remain unalloyed  by misfortune and that the remainder of their days may be spent in a state of uninterrupted tranquillity In this prayer  you  I am sure will readily join as well as in admiring the unsearchable ways of Providence Don Alonzo joins your Isabella in every warmest wish for the happiness of Donna Laura as does her  Sincere friend And faithful servant ALBERTO  P S As soon as Isabella's spirits are at all recovered from their present  agitated state she means to set out for Ventina there to embrace her muchloved Laura  ALONZO DE CASTINA  POSTSCRIPT BY THE EDITOR  HENCEFORTH never let mortals become the victims of despair Never let them cease to
