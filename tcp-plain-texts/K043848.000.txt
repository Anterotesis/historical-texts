 REFLECTIONS Critical and Satyrical UPON A LATE RHAPSODY Call'd An ESSAY UPON CRITICISM  By Mr DENNIS  Me Remorsurum petis  Melius non Tangere clamo  Horace  LONDON  Printed for BERNARD LINTOTT at the  Cross Keys  between the  Two TempleGates  in  Fleetstreet  Price  d  THE PREFACE  'TIS now almost seven Years since I happen'd to say one Morning to a certain Person distinguish'd by Merit and Quality that wherever the  Italian Opera  had come it had driven out Poetry from that Nation and not only Poetry but the very Tast of Poetry and of all the politer Arts and that if the same Protection and Encouragement were continued to the  Opera  by which it was then supported the same  Calamity would befal  Great Britain  which had happen'd to the Neighbouring Nations As 'tis hard to find a Man more quick or more penetrating than the Person to whom I spoke this he immediately enter'd into that Sentiment and soon after withdrew that Encouragement which he had given to the  Italians  All that I foretold and more than all hath happen'd For such Things such monstrous Things have been lately writ and such monstrous Judgments pass'dâ–ª that what has been formerly said has been sufficiently confirm'd that 'tis impossible an Author can be so very foolish but he will find more stupid Admirers  A most notorious Instance of this Depravity of Genius and Tast is the Essay upon which the following Reflections are writ and the Approbation which it has met with I will not deny but that there are two or three Passages in it with which I am not displeas'd but what are two or three Passages as to the whole  Fit Chaerilus ille  Quem bis ter{que} bonum cum risu miror  The approving two or Three Passages amongst a multitude of bad ones is by no means advantageous to an Author That little that is  good in him does but set off its contrary and make it appear more extravagant The Thoughts Expressions and Numbers of this Essay are for the most part but very indifferent and indifferent and execrable in Poetry are all one But what is worse than all the rest we find throughout the whole a deplorable want of that very Quality which ought principally to appear in it which is Judgment and I have no Notion that where there is so great a want of Judgment there can be any Genius  However I had not publish'd the following Letter but had suffer'd his Readers to have bugg'd themselves in the Approbation of a Pamphlet so very undeserving if I had not found things in it that have provok'd my Scorn tho' not my Indignation For I not only found my self attack'd without any manner of Provocation on my side and attack'd in my Person instead of my Writings by one who is wholly a Stranger to me and at a time when all the World knew that I was persecuted by Fortune I not only saw that this was attempted in a clandestine manner with the utmost Falshood and Calumny but found that all this was done by a little affected Hypocrite who had nothing in his mouth at the same time but  Truth    Candor    Friendship    good Nature    Humanity  and  Magnanimity  'Tis for this Reason that I have publish'd the following Letter in which if I have not treated the Author of the Essay with my usual Candor he may thank himself and this goodnatur'd Town For having observ'd with no little Astonishment that Persons have been censur'd for ill Nature who have attempted to display the Errors of Authors undeservedly successful tho' they have done this with all imaginable Candor and with the best and noblest Designs which are the doing Justice the Discovery of Truth and the Improvement of Arts while Writers of Lampoons and infamous Libels whose Anonymous Authors have lain lurking in the dark sometimes in Clubs and sometimes solitary like so many common Rogues and Footpads to ruin the Fortunes and murder the Reputations of others have been caress'd and bugg'd by their thoughtless Applauders and treated as if they had been the most vertuous and the best natur'd Men in the World having observ'd all this with no little astonishment I at last found out the reason of it which is because the Attempts of Libellers and Lampooners hurt only those whom they attack and delight the rest of the Readers whereas they who expose by a just Criticism the Absurdities of foolish fortunate Authors attack all those who commend and admire those Authors and disturb perhaps by opening their Eyes no fewer than a thousand  Fops in the good Opinion which they have conceiv'd of themselves 'Tis for this Reason that I have endeavour'd to comply with this wise and good natur'd general Disposition of Minds and to make amends for the Illnature of my Criticism by the Allurements of my  Satyr  Lately Publish'd by Mr  Dennis    THE Grounds of Criticism in Poetry contain'd in some New Discoveries never made before requisite for the writing and judging of Poems surely Being a Preliminary to a larger Work Entituled A Criticism upon our most celebrated  English  Poets Which will be publish'd in small Volumes  An Essay upon Publick Spirit being a Satyr in Prose upon the Manners and Luxury of the Times the chief Source of our present Parties and Divisions Price  d  Both Printed for  Bernard Lintott  To Mr  at  SunningHill Berks  SIR  I Here send you my Answer to the two Questions which I lately received from you which are whether the Essay upon Criticism which I lately sent you is like to take in Town and who is the Author of that anonymous Rhapsody  In answer to the first Question my Opinion is that it will take very well For the same thing is true of great Bodies of Men which has been observ'd of particular Persons and that is that when Genius thinks fit to depart from among them good Taste never cares to be very long after it When the  Italian  Opera drove Poetry from out this Island Criticism thought it a very great Impertinence for her to stay long behind Besides that the elegant Translations of the  Italian  Opera's which Mr  Tonson  has published by the most eminent Hands have prepared People to like any thing that is of an equal Merit with those Translations and with  Tom Sternhold  's Version  For the second  Quaere  Mr  is of Opinion that this Essay was writ by some experienced judicious Person who knows what Quantity of base Alloy is at this Juncture requisite to debase the Coin of  Parnassus  and reduce it to the current Standard But I am inclin'd to believe that it was writ by some young or some raw Author for the following Reasons  First He discovers in every Page a Sufficiency that is far beyond his little Ability and hath rashly undertaken a Task which is infinitely above his Force a Task that is only fit for the Author with the just Encomium of whose Essay my Lord  Roscommon  begins his own  Happy that Author whose correct Essay  Repairs so well our old  Horatian  way  There is nothing more wrong more low or more incorrect than this Rhapsody upon Criticism The Author all along taxes others with Faults of which he is more guilty himself He tells us in the very two first Lines that  'Tis hard to say if greater want of Skill  Appear in writing or in judging ill  Now whereas others have been at some Pains and Thought to shew each of these wants of Skill separately and distinctly his comprehensive Soul hath most ingeniously contriv'd to shew them both in a supreme Degree together  Secondly While this little Author struts and affects the Dictatorian Air he plainly shews that at the same time he is under the Rod and that while he pretends to give Laws to others he is himself a pedantick Slave to Authority and Opinion of which I shall give some Instances  In the beginning of his Essay he lays down this Maxim  Let such teach others who themselves excel  And censure others who have written well  Where he would insinuate that they alone are fit to be Criticks who have shewn themselves great Poets And he brings in  Pliny  to confirm by his Authority the Truth of a Precept which is denied by matter of Fact and by the Experience of above Two thousand Years  De Pictore Sculptore Fictore nisi Artifex judicare non potest  It has been observed by Writers of Politicks That they who have succeeded best in these kind of Writings have never been either Governours of Provinces or Ministers of State as  Plato  and  Aristotle  in  Greece    Machiavel  in  Italy  and in this Island  Harrington  I will not say that this may be applied to Criticks There are and have been very good ones who have been great Poets as  Horace  in  Italy    Boileau  in  France  and in  Great Britain  my Lord  Roscommon  and a living noble Author Nay I am fully convinc'd that there never was an admirable Poet but he was a great Critick For what can be more absurd than to imagine that any Man can excel in any Art or Business or Profession who  does not understand that Profession Art or Business Now he who understands the Art of Poetry is a Critick in Poetry But this is undeniable at the same time that there have been Criticks who have been approv'd of by all the World who never meddled with Poetry Was  Aristotle  himself the very Father of  Criticks  a Poet Why yes 'tis pretended that there is a Fragment of an Ode which was writ by him remaining in  Athenaeus  But is that sufficient to denominate him a Poet Did he ever write either Tragedy or Epick Poem And yet how freely did he censure both Tragick and Epick Poets  Dionysius Halicarnassaeus  and  Dionysius Longinus  among the  Greeks  and  Quintilian  among the  Romans  were free Censurers yet no Poets And so are  Bossu  and  Dacier  at present among the  French  And what is still more remarkable is that this young Author forgets himself to that degree as to commend  Longinus  and  Quintilian  for accomplish'd Criticks contrary to his own Precept  Another Instance which I shall give of his being a Slave to Authority and Opinion is the servile Deference which he pays to the Ancients  P  Still Green with Bays each ancient Altar stands  Above the reach of sacrilegious Hands  Secure from Flames from Envy's fiercer Rage  Destructive War and all devouring Age  See from each Clime the Learn'd their Incense bring  Hear in all Tongues triumphant Poeans ring  In Praise so just let ev'ry Voice be join'd  And fill the general Chorus of Mankind  Which is just the opposite Extravagance and Extreme to that of Monsieur  Perrault  For the  French  man with an insolent Stupidity contemn'd and blasphem'd even those Hero's of Antiquity whose Writings are admirable and Divine This Essayer deifies Authors whose Writings are but tolerable and indifferent  Boileau  as a reasonable Man took the Path that lay in the middle of the two Extremes as we shall see by what follows  For what remains says he I would not have any one think that in this number of ancient Writers approv'd of by all Ages 'tis my Intention to comprehend some Authors  who indeed are ancient but who have only acquir'd a moderate Esteem as  Lycophron    Nonnus    Silius Italicus  and the Author of the Tragedies which are attributed to  Seneca  to whom in my mind we may not only boldly compare but justly prefer several of the modern Writers I only admit into that exalted Rank that small number of admirable Writers whose Name alone is their Panegyrick as  Homer    Plato    Cicero    Virgil    c  And I do not regulate the Esteem which I have for them by that length of Time which their Works have lasted but by the number of Years which they have been admir'd of which 'tis convenient to advertise a great many People who otherwise perhaps might indiscreetly believe what Monsieur  Perrault  has a mind to insinuate that we commend the Ancients for no other Reason but because they are Ancients and blame the Moderns for no other Reason but because they are Moderns which is utterly false since there are several among the Ancients whom we do not admire and several among the Moderns whom all the World extols The Antiquity of a Writer is no certain proof of his Merit but the ancient and constant Admiration which all the World has had for his Writings is a certain and infallible proof that we ought to admire them  Boileau  Reflect the  th  on  Longinus  Thus hath  Boileau  determin'd this matter like a dextrous Distinguisher and a most rightful Judge If I may be allow'd to speak my Sentiments after so great a Master I must freely declare my Opinion that of all the Poets among the  Graecians  I only admire  Homer    Sophocles    Pindar  and  Euripides  tho' I am very much pleas'd with some of the rest and of all the Poets among the  Romans  I admire only  Virgil  and  Horace  and some parts of  Lucretius  tho' I am very much pleas'd with  Catullus    Tibullus    Terence  and others For as for  Lycophron    Nonnus    Apollonius Rhodius    Valerius Flaccus    Silius Italicus    Statius  I prefer the  Paradise lost  of  Milton  before them all together Nay I will go yet farther and declare that tho' I must freely own that  Virgil  has infinitely the Advantage of  Milton  in the wonderful Contrivance of his Poem in the Harmony of his Versification and in the constant Tenor of his Majesty and his Elevation yet that  Milton  in some particular parts of his Poem has the Advantage of  Virgil  and of Mankind  And tho' I can by no means believe  Shakespear  to be of equal Merit with  Sophocles  or  Euripides  for which I shall give my Reasons in another place yet this I can say for the Honour of my Countryman and of  Great Britain  that there are several single Scenes in  Shakespear  which I prefer to all the Tragedies put together of which  Seneca  is accounted the Author  I shall give one more Instance by which it will appear that while this Youngster is pretending to give Laws he behaves himself like one who is still in awe of the Rod that he admires the Ancients because his Master tells him that they must be admir'd and that if the Ancients were his Contemporaries and produc'd the same Writings now which they did formerly he would use them with the same Insolence with which he treats his Contemporaries In the  th  Page of this Essay he gives a verbose and indigested Encomium of the first  Graecian  Criticks but forgets and contradicts himself before he comes to the bottom of that very Page For says he  The gen'rous Critick fann'd the Poet's Fire  And taught the World with Reason to admire  Then Criticism the Muses Handmaid proud  To dress her Charms and make her more belov'd  But following Wits from that Intention stray'd  Who could not win the Mistress woo'd the Maid  Set up themselves and drove a sep'rate Trade  Never was any thing more obscure and confus'd than the foregoing Rhimes but if there is any meaning in them it must be that which follows  At first Poets and Criticks were all one and these Poets made use of their Criticism only to make their Poetry more charming and more accomplish'd But the Wits who immediately follow'd after them deviated from the Design of their Predecessors and not being able to attain to Poetry took up a Resolution to drive a separate Trade and to set up only for Criticks If this is not his meaning I should be glad to hear in Prose and in plain  English  what his meaning is for Rhime has been always a wicked Abettor and Concealer of Nonsense But if this is his meaning then I desire to make these two Remarks First that the ancientest Criticks among the  Graecians  were not  Poets as we observ'd before and Secondly that if  Aristotle  and  Dionysius Halicarnassaeus  and others were now alive and their excellent Criticisms were now first to appear it would be objected to those great Men in order to disqualify them for Criticks that they were no Versifyers And it is plain from the  d  Page that another Objection would be made to them For when he comes there to speak of the Moderns he tells us  Some dryly plain without Invention's Aid  Write dull Receipts how Poems may be made  Now it being evident that the Criticisms of  Aristotle  and of  Dionysius Halicarnassaeus  are writ with a great deal of Simplicity 'tis manifest that if those two Criticks had writ but yesterday they would be accus'd to day of being drily plain and of writing dull Receipts  But a third infallible mark of a young Author is that he hath done in this Essay what Schoolboys do by their Exercises he hath borrow'd both from Living and Dead and particularly from the Authors of the two famous Essays upon Poetry and Translated Verse but so borrow'd that he seems to have the very Reverse of  Midas  's noble Faculty For as the coursest and the dullest Metals were upon the touch of that  Lydian  Monarch immediately chang'd into fine Gold so the finest Gold upon this Author's handling it in a moment loses both its lustre and its weight and is immediately turn'd to Lead  A fourth thing that shews him a young man is the not knowing his own mind and his frequent Contradictions of himself His Title seems to promise an Essay upon Criticism in general which afterwards dwindles to an Essay upon Criticism in Poetry And after all he is all along giving Rules such as they are for Writing rather than Judging In the beginning of the  th  Page the Rules are nothing but Nature  These Rules of old discover'd not devis'd  Are Nature still but Nature methodiz'd  But no sooner is he come to the  th  Page but the Rules and Nature are two different things  When first great  Maro  in his boundless mind  A Work t'outlast immortal  Rome  design'd  Perhaps he seem'd above the Critick's Law  And but from Nature's Fountains scorn'd to draw  But in the last Line of this very Paragraph they are the same things again  Learn hence for ancient Rules and just Esteem  To copy Nature is to copy them  But to this he will answer That he is guilty of no Contradiction that he is only shewing that  Virgil  was guilty of Error and Ignorance who first absurdly began to write his  Aeneis  and afterwards sate down to learn the Rules of Writing which when he began to write that Poem he took to be things distinct from Nature but that after he had wrote part of it he fell to the reading of  Homer  and that undeceiv'd him That while he is talking of  Virgil  's Error and Ignorance he is making a Parade of his own incomparable Wisdom and Knowledge and not contradicting himself but  Virgil  or rather making him appear inconsistent with and contradicting himself for that tho'  Virgil  took the Rules and Nature to be distinct from each other for his own part he is wiser and knows better things Now is not this a very modest and a very judicious Gentleman  A fifth Sign of his being a young Author is his being almost perpetually in the wrong And here in relation to the foregoing passage I might desire to ask him one or two civil Questions First who acquainted him with that noble Particularity of  Virgil  's Life that he designed to write his  Aeneis  without Art Had he it from ancient or modern Authors or does he owe it to a noble Effort of his own sagacious Soul If  Virgil  had so little Knowledge of the Rules of his own Art and so very little true Judgment within him as to be capable of such an Extravagance an Extravagance which says this Essayer nothing but the reading of  Homer  was able to correct how comes he so far to have surpass'd his Master in the admirable Contrivance of his Poem But secondly what  does he mean by  Maro  's designing a Work to outlast immortal  Rome  Does he pretend to put that Figure call'd a Bull upon  Virgil  Or would he ambitiously have it pass for his own 'Tis no wonder that one who is capable of imputing so great an Extravagance to  Virgil  should be capable of writing himself without any manner of meaning  Whenever we find a Simile the first Line of it is like a Warningpiece to give us notice that something extraordinary false or foolish is to follow We have one in the  th  Page where the former and the latter part have not the least relation and bear not the least proportion to one another  As on the Land while here the Ocean gains  In other Parts it leaves wide sandy Plains  Thus in the Soul while Memory prevails  The solid Power of Understanding fails  Where Beams of warm Imagination play  The Memory's soft Figures melt away  Here the Soul in the third Verse is made to answer to Land in the first and Memory to Ocean which in the fourth Verse is chang'd for Understanding tho' in this Simile the Author shews neither Memory nor Understanding for there are as many Absurdities in it as there are Lines At this rate a man may make a thousand Similes in an hour Any thing may become like to any thing  Jungentur jam Gryphes Equis  But what a thoughtless Creature is this Essayer to deny in these very Rhimes by which he pretends to shew both Poetry and Criticism the coexistence of those Qualities without which 'tis impossible to be both Poet and Critick Besides how wrong is this and how many Persons have I known who have had all these Qualities at the same time in a very great degree What follows is more wrong and more absurd  One Science only will one Genius fit  So vast is Art so narrow Human Wit  Is not this a rare Pretender to Poetry and Criticism who talks at this rate when all the World knows that 'tis impossible for a Man with only one Science to be either Poet or Critick Which is so much the more unlucky because the very Fathers of Poetry and Criticism  Homer  and  Aristotle  whom he mentions so often in this Essay are believed to have had all the Sciences 'Tis now between Two and three thousand Years since  Aristotle  wrote his Morals his Politicks his Rhetorick and his Poetick and three of these are the very best in their kinds to this very day and have infinitely the Advantage of all those several thousand Treatises that have been writ since What follows is still more false and more abominable  Not only bounded to peculiar Arts  But ev'n in those confin'd to single Parts  What a wretched narrow Soul hath this Essayer And what a thoughtless onewhen  Homer  whom he mentions so often in this Essay had as admirable a Talent for Pleasantry as he had a Genius equal to the most exalted Poetry To come to the  Romans    Horace  is famous both for Elevation and Pleasantry  Virgil  succeeded in his  Bucolicks  and  Georgicks  as well as he did in his  Aeneis  To descend to the Moderns  Shakespear  had a very good Genius for Tragedy and a very good Talent for Comedy And since him  Otway  had likewise a Talent for both  But in the next Page there is likewise a Simile and therefore we may be sure as we observ'd above that most of that Page is one continued Absurdity P  First follow Nature and your Judgment frame  By her just Standard which is still the same  Unerring Nature still divinely bright  One clear unchang'd and universal Light  Life Force and Beauty next to all impart  At once the Source and End and Test of Artâ–ª  Now here would I fain ask one or two Questions Is he giving Rules here for Judging or for Writing And is he prescribing those Rules to the Knowing or the Ignorant  If he says to the Knowing what is it that he tells them here That they must judge according to Nature or write according to Nature Now does he tell them any thing in this that they did not know before Well but he says he is laying down these Rules for the Ignorant why then I humbly conceive that he ought to have told them what he means by Nature and what it is to write or to judge according to Nature For by expressing himself at the rate that he does he neither says any thing to the Learned which they did not know before nor any thing to the Ignorant which they can possibly understand  Horace  proceeded in a very different Method from this when he was to acquaint the  Piso  's what was the principal Source of good Writing he not only told them that it was moral Philosophy  Scribendi recte sapere est principium Fons  But pointed to the very Books where they might find that moral Philosophy  Rem tibi Socraticae poterant ostendere Chartae  So that in one we have a clear and perspicuous Precept and in the other an obscure and unintelligible Jargon But let us go on  That Art is best which most resembles her  Which still presides yet never does appear  That is as much as to say  Artis est celare artem  the common Subject that Pedants give their Boys to make Themes and Declamations upon Is not this a noble Discovery Well but now for the Simile  In some fair Body thus the sprightly Soul  With Spirit feeds with Vigor fills the whole  Each motion guides and ev'ry nerve sustains  It self unseen hut in th' effects remains  This Youngster has not memory enough to know what he said six Lines before  Thus in a Soul where memory ne'r prevails  The solid Power of understanding fails  In the fifth Line of this Page it was Nature that  Life force and beauty must to all impart  And here in the  th  we are told that 'tis Art that  With Spirit feeds with Vigor fills the whole  But how absurdly is Art compar'd to the Soul to which only Genius can be justly compar'd according to the Observation in the Essay upon Poetry But let us go on and we shall find that as all that went before this Simile is unintelligible so all is mighty absurd that follows it  There are whom Heav'n hath bless'd with store of Wit  Yet want as much again to manage it  By the way what rare Numbers are here Would not one swear that this Youngster had espous'd some antiquated Muse who had sued out a Divorce upon the account of Impotence from some superannuated Sinner and who having been pox'd by her former Spouse has got the Gout in her decrepit Age which makes her hobble so damnablyWhy this is more dismal than the  Italian  Opera both that and the Essay are but sounds but that is Harmony and this is Discord  But now my dear Friend if I had young Mr  Bays  here I would desire that I might ask him one Question and he not be angry And that is what he means by  There are whom Heav'n has bless'd with store of Wit  Yet want as much again to manage it  But let us go on and see if 'tis possible to find it out without him  For Wit and Judgment ever are at strife  Tho' meant each others are like Man and Wife  That is as much as to say there are People who have tha  which they call Wit without one dram of Judgment  not this another wonderful Discovery But I fancy tha  Mr  Bays  has the Misfortune to be wrong in the first Vers  of the foresaid Couplet  For Wit and Judgment ever are at strife  What a Devil Mr  Bays  they cannot be at strife sure af+ter they are parted after Wit has made an Elopement  has been barbarously forsaken by Judgment or turn'd to separate maintenanceâ–ª Much less can they be at strife whe  they never came together which is the Case in the Essayâ–ª But now we talk of Man and Wife let us consider the Yokefellow to the former Rhime  Tho' meant each others and like Man and Wife  Now cannot I for my Soul conceive the reciprocal  Aid  that there is between Wit and Judgment For tho' I can easily conceive how Judgment may keep Wit in her Senses yet cannot I possibly understand how Wit can controul or redress or be a help to Judgment  If Mr  Bays  in that Couplet  There are whom Heav'n has bless'd with store of Wit  Yet want as much agen to manage it  Intended to say that People have sometimes store of false Wit without Judgment to manage it he intended nothing but what all the World knew before But if he meant to fay this of true Wit nothing can be more mistaken for I cannot conceive how any one can have store of Wit without Judgment I believe that Father  Bouheurs  has given a tolerable Description of Wit in his Treatise upon that Subject  C'est un solide qxi brille  Tis a shining Solid like a Diamond which the more solid it is is always the more glittering and derives its height of Lustre from its perfect Solidity  Now how any thing in the Works of the Mind can be solid without Judgment I leave Mr  Bays  to consider  But let us pass to the  th  Page at the bottom of which we shall find another Simile and consequently another Absurdity  Poets like Painters thus unskill'd to trace  The naked Nature and the living Grace  With Gold and Jewels cover ev'ry part  And hide with Ornament their want of Art  Which in Prose and plain  English  runs thus  Poets like Painters not having the Skill to draw Nature without Art hide their want of Art with a superabundance of Art  In the  th  Page we have another Simile and consequently another Absurdity  But true Expression like th' unchanging Sun  Clears and improves whate'er it shines upon  Which is borrow'd from the Essay on Poetry  True Wit is everlasting like the Sun  But awkardly borrow'd and utterly spoil'd in the removal For what can Expression be properly said to shine upon True Wit or Genius for that the noble Author means as is plain from several parts of his Poem shines thro' and discovers it self by the Expression but Expression at the very best can but shine with a borrow'd Light like the Moon and the rest of the Planets whereas Genius shines and flames with its own Celestial Fire  His Instructions his Assertions his Commendations his Censures his Advice wherever they are his own are either false or trivial or both Such is that in the beginning of the twelfth Page  And tho' the Ancients thus their Rules invade  As Kings dispense with Laws themselves have made  Moderns beware  Thus is this Essayer for a double Dispensing Power in Kings and ancient Authors and is for making the Moderns doubly Slaves Slaves in their Actions and Slaves in their Writings But as we boldly deny that Kings have either Power to make Laws or to dispense with them after they are made so those Laws of Writing were neither made by the Ancients nor can those Ancients dispense with them As they are the Laws of Nature and not of Men as he has himself hinted in the beginning of the  th  Page  Those Rules of old discover'd not devis'd  Are Nature still but Nature methodiz'd  They are eternal and irrevocable and never to be dispens'd with but by Nature that made them and the only Rule for that Dispensation is this that a less Law may be violated to avoid the infringing of a greater and 'tis equally the Duty both of Ancients and Moderns to break thro' a less important Rule when without that Infringement a greater must be violated or the great End of all the Rules neglected The great End of all the Rules is to instruct and the subordinate End is to please by moving of Passion and particularly that kind of Passion which ought chiefly to reign in that sort of Poetry in which the Poet writes Now 'tis a Rule in Poetry that the notorious Events of History are not to be falsifyed nor the Periods of Time transpos'd or confounded And yet  Virgil  in the fourth of his  Aeneis  broke thro' this Rule at once by a bold and a judicious Anachronism in order to make his Poem more admirable and the more to exalt the Glory of the  Roman  Name Whatever the Ancients justly did the Moderns may justly do 'Tis ridiculous and pedantick to imagine that the natural Powers of the Soul were stronger or more excellent in the Ancients than they are in the Moderns And as to Experience we have vastly the Advantage of them When we consider Experience as my Lord  Bacon  observes we are properly the Ancients who live in the elder Ages of the World and have the Advantage of the Knowledge of Three thousand Years over the first Writers Not but that at the same time that I assert the Equality of Faculties in the Moderns  and the Advantage of their Experience I freely acknowledge the actual Preheminence that several of the Ancients have over the Moderns but I have sufficiently shewn in the  Advancement of Modern Poetry  that that actual Preheminence proceeded from accidental Causes and not from any Superiority of Faculties in those ancient Authors  At the bottom of the same Page there is something asserted that is both false and impudent where speaking of the Ancients he tells us  Those are but Stratagems which Errors seem  Nor is it  Homer  nods but we that dream  Which is a presumptuous Contradiction of  Horace  â–ª  Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus  And of my Lord  Roscommon  His reeling Hero's and his wounded Gods  Make some suspect he snores as well as nods  And is in effect to declare that  Horace  was a Dreamer and my Lord  Roscommon  a Dotard and I my Masters only I am  alerte  and  eueillÃ¨  only I am the man of Importance  In the beginning of the  st  Page there is something too very wrong  In Words as Fashions the same Rule will bold  Alike fantastick if too new or old  Be not the first by whom the new are try'd  Nor yet the last to lay the old aside  This being directed to all without Exception and deliver'd without Limitation or Restriction is another flat Contradiction of  Horace  Si forte necesse est  Indiciis monstr are recentibus abdita rerum  Fingere cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis  Continget dabitur{que} licentia sumpta pudenter  Et nova ficta{que} nuper habebunt verba fidem si  Graeco fonte cadant parce detorta  This is likewise a Libel upon the memory of Mr  Dryden  whom he pretends to admire for never any one was a greater Coiner than he and it is directly contrary to the Improvement of Languages for it  Chaucer  and succeeding Authors had had this Advice given them and had been weak enough to take it how could our Language ever have improv'd in Purity in Force in Grace or in Harmony But if it was allow'd to  Chaucer  and those who immediately follow'd him why must it be deny'd to those who have liv'd since  quid autem  Caecilio Plauto{que} dabit Romanus ademptum  Virgilio Varroque Ego cur acquir  re pauca  Si possim invideor Quum lingua Catonis Enni  Sermonem patrium ditaverit nova rerum  Nomina protulerit licuit semper{que} licebit  Signatum praesente nota procudere nomen  I must confess if we speak with relation to the constant and general Practice of a Writer he ought to take what the  French  call the best Use for the Mistress of the Language in which he writes but a great Poet if he writes in the Language which he was born to speak may be allow'd the Privilege sometimes to coin new words and sometimes to revive the old which last succeeded so well to  Milton  About the middle of the  d  Page he gives Advice which shews him very inconsistent with himself  And praise the easie Vigor of a Line  Where  Denham  's Strength and  Waller  's Sweetness join  How vastly different is this from what he pretends to advise at the bottom of the  th  Page  Be  Homer  's Works your Study day and night  Read them by day and meditate by night  Thence form your Judgment thence your Notions bring  And trace the Muses upward to their Spring  Still with it self compar'd his Text peruse  And let your Comment be the  Mantuan  Muse  Now he who is familiar with  Homer  and intimate with  Virgil  will not be extremely affected either with the Sweetness of  Waller  or the Force of  Denham  He requires something that is far above the Level of modern Authors something that is great and wonderful If I were to recommend a  British  Poet to one who has been habituated to  Homer  and  Virgil  I would for the Honour of my Country and of my own Judgment advise him to read  Milton  who very often equals both the  Graecian  and the  Roman  in their extraordinary Qualities and sometimes surpasses them is more lofty more terrible more vehement more astonishing and has more impetuous and more divine Raptures I will not deny but that  Waller  has Sweetness and  Denham  Force but their good and their shining Qualities are so sophisticated and debauch'd with these modern Vices of Conceit and Point and Turn and Epigram that 'tis impossible they can affect in an extraordinary manner those who have been long acquainted with the Ancients  There is in the  th  and the  th  Pages another Inconsistency which I desire to lay before the Reader In the  th  Page he speaks of  Horace  thus  He who supreme in Judgment as in Wit  Might boldly censure as he boldly writ  Yet judg'd with Coolness tho' he sung with Fire  His Precepts teach but what his Works inspire  Our Criticks take a contrary Extreme  They judge with Fury but they write with Flegm  Before he goes ten Lines farther he forgets himself and commends  Longinus  for the very contrary Quality for which he commended  Horace  and for the very same thing for which he condemns his Contemporaries  The Muses sure  Longinus  did inspire  And blest their Critick with a Poet's Fire  An ardent Judge that zealous in his Trust  With warmth gives Judgment yet is always just  Whose own Example strengthens all his Laws  And is himself that great Sublime he draws  He commends  Horace  for judging cooly in Verse and extols  Longinus  for criticizing with Fire in Prose What a miserable Slave is this Author to Opinion Can any thing be more plain than that he condemns his Contemporaries for no other reason but because they are his Contemporaries and commends  Longinus  for no other reason but because he has been approv'd of by others For why should not a modern Critick imitate the great Qualities of  Longinus  and when he treats of a Subject which is sublime treat of it sublimely Now he who writes any thing with Sublimity let it be Prose or Verse let it be Criticism or Poetry writes sometimes with Fury as  Longinus  hath shewn both by his Doctrine and his Example in the first Chapter of his Treatise  But pray who are these Moderns that judge with Fury and write with Flegm Who are they that have writ both Criticism and Poetry who have not in their Poetry shewn a thousand times this Essayer's Fire Who is there among them that is not above borrowing so openly and so awkwardly from the most known Authors For what Reader is so unacquainted with our  English  Poetry as not to know that he has taken this last Couplet with a very little variation from the Essay on Translated Verse  Thus make the proper Use of each Extreme  And write with Fury but correct with Flegm  But what is a perspicuous sensible Precept in my Lord  Roscommon  as soon as this Essayer handles it becomes a gros  Absurdity and a palpable Contradiction  In the  th  Page there are no less than two or three Ab+surdities in the compass of four Lines  Now length of Fame our second Life is lost  And bare Threescore is all ev'n that can boast  Our Sons their Fathers failing Language see  And such as  Chaucer  is shall  Dryden  be  Now what does young Mr  Bays  mean by  our second Life  and by  bare Threescore  If he speaks of himself and means threescore Days he means too much in Reason But if he speaks of  Chaucer    Spencer  and  Shakespear  and means threescore Years he means too little in Conscience 'Tis now a hundred Years since  Shakespear  began to write more since  Spencer  flourished and above Years since  Chaucer  died And yet the Fame of none of these is extinguish'd The Reason that he gives for this is false too  Our Sons their Fathers failing Language see  Mr  Waller  may suffice to shew the Falsity of this 'Tis above threescore Years since that Gentleman began to write and yet his Language is still good and new Thus we find that the Assertion is false here the Reason of it false and we shall find anon that the Inference is false too  And such as  Chaucer  is shall  Dryden  be  That is shall grow obsolete and neglected and be either forgot or be read but by a few  Whether the Language of Mr  Dryden  will ever be as obsolete as is at present that of  Chaucer  is what neither this Author nor any one else can tell For ev'ry Language hath its particular period of Time to bring it to Perfection I mean to all the Perfection of which that Language is capable And they who are alive cannot possibly tell whether that period hath happen'd or not If that period has not yet happen'd yet 'tis not the Obsoleteness of Language which makes a Poet fall from the Reputation which he once enjoy'd provided the Language in which that Poet wrote was at the Time of his Writing come to be capable of Harmony For  Spencer  is obsolete yet is still renown'd That which makes an Author fall from his former Reputation is says  Boileau  in his seventh Reflection upon  Longinus  his not  having attain'd to that Point of Solidity and Perfection which are necessary to give a never dying Esteem to his Works For Example says he the Latin Tongue in which  Cicero  and  Virgil  wrote was already very much alter'd in the Time of  Quintilian  and of  Aulus Gellius  and yet  Cicero  and  Virgil  were more esteem'd when those Criticks wrote than they were in their own Age because they had as it were by their Writings fix'd the  Roman  Language having attain'd to that Point of Solidity and Perfection which I have mention'd above  If we reflect upon that miserable Tast which reigns now among our Readers and that want of Genius which is so deplorable in our present Writers and that Tast and Genius daily more and more decline we may without being Prophets foretel according to the foremention'd Observation of the Solidity and Perfection of Poems that the Language is not like to alter to the Disadvantage of those Poets whose Works are the only Remains of them here below But be that as it will yet this is certain that Mr  Dryden  had one Quality in his Language which  Chaucer  had not and which must always remain For having acquir'd some Justness of Numbers and some Truth of Harmony and of Versification to which  Chaucer  thro' the Rudeness of the Language or want of Ear or want of Experience or rather perhaps a mixture of all could not possibly attain that Justness of Numbers and Truth of Harmony and of Versification can never be destroy'd by any alteration of Language and therefore Mr  Dryden  whatever alteration happens to the Language can never be like to  Chaucer  Wherever this Gentleman talks of Wit he is sure to say something that is very foolish as Page  What is this Wit that does our Cares employ  The Owner's Wife that other Men enjoy  The more his Trouble as the more admir'd  Where wanted scorn'd and envy'd where acquir'd  Here again I desire leave to ask two or three Questions First how can Wit be scorn'd where it is not Is not this a Figure frequently employ'd in  Hibernian  Land The Person who wants this Wit may indeed be scorn'd but such a Contempt declares the Honour that the Contemner has for Wit But secondly what does he mean by acquir'd Wit Does he mean Genius by the word Wit or Conceit and Point If he means Genius that is certainly never to be acquir'd and the Person who should pretend to acquire it would be always secure from Envy But if by Wit he means Conceit and Point those are things that ought never to be in Poetry unless by chance sometimes in the Epigram or in Comedy where it is proper to the Character and the Occasion and ev'n in Comedy it ought always to give place to Humour and ev'n to be lost and absorp'd in that according to the Precept of the noble Author of the  Essay on Poetry  That silly thing Men call sheer Wit avoid  With which our Age so nauseously is cloy'd  Humour is all Wit should be only brought  To turn agreeably some proper Thought  In the beginning of the  d  Page there is a Couplet of Advice the first line of which is very impertinent and the second very wrong  Be silent always when you doubt your Sense  Now who are the Persons to whom he is giving Advice here Why to Poets or Criticks or both but the Persons to whom he ought to be speaking are Criticks that is People who pretend to instruct others But can any man of common Sense want to be told that he ought not to pretend to instruct others as long as he doubts of the Truth of his own Precepts  But what can be more wrong or more absurd than the latter Verse of the Couplet  Speak when you're sure yet speak with Diffidence  Now I should think that when a man is sure 'tis his Duty to speak with a modest Assurance since in doing otherwise he betrays the Truth especially when he  speaks to those who are guided more by Imagination than they are by Judgment which is the Case of three parts of the World and three parts of the other Part  He is so great a Lover of Falshood that whenever he has a mind to calumniate his Contemporaries he upbraids them with some Defect which is just contrary to some good Quality for which all their Friends and their Acquaintance commend them As for Example if a Man is remarkable for the extraordinary Deference which he pays to the Opinions and the Remonstrances of his Friends him he Libels for his Impatience under Reproof On the contrary if he has a mind to extol the Ancients he passes by either thro' Envy or Ignorance all the great Qualities which they have and extols them for some peculiar one the very want of which is known to all the World to be their Infirmity and their Defect Thus in the  th  Page he takes occasion to commend  Aristotle  for what he wrote in Physicks a great deal of which is so justly censur'd and condemn'd ev'n by the same learned and judicious Men who allow his  Aethicks  his  Politicks  his  Rhetorick  and his  Poetick  to be worthy of the greatest Philosopher And here as the Commendation which he gives him is false the manner of giving it is still more false For says he  Not only Nature did his Laws obey  But Fancy's boundless Empire own'd his Sway  The Expression in the first Verse is not only absurd but blasphemous The Laws of Nature are unalterable and indispensable but by God himself and the greatest Excellence to which the wisest Philosopher can attain is not to controul but to obey Nature  In the Libel upon King  Charles  the Second he has not only endeavour'd to brand the Memory of that Prince for something which is utterly false but for something which if it had been true had been an Excellence in that Prince For  Wits  says he in that Monarch's Reign had Pensions when all the World knows that it was one of the Faults of that Reign that none  of the politer Arts were then encourag'd For of this we may be sure that whenever we have a Prince and Ministers who truly understand either their own Interest or that of the Publick Arts and Learning will be then encourag'd I mean not speciously and pretendedly but really and sincerely  The King of  France  pretended to encourage Arts by allowing Pensions to some few Professors of them whereas at the same time he was and is doing a thing which has a natural Tendency to the driving them out of  Europe  For by kindling and prosecuting an unjust War thro' so many different Nations he has gone a very great way towards the barbarizing the Christian World and the Arts would have been at a much greater height than they are now without any manner of Encouragement from him if they had been suffer'd to have enjoy'd the Quiet of an universal Peace In the same manner some Persons of Quality in  Great Britain  have been kind to some particular Professors of Poetry but at the very same time by not only introducing the  Italian  Opera among us but by continuing constant Encouragers of it to this very day they are doing a thing which will drive the very Art it self out of the Kingdom as it has been already driven out of every other Nation and are depriving their Favourite Authors of more than ever they yet bestow'd upon them Any great Minister would now have a glorious Opportunity of being a true Encourager of Poetry and ev'ry other generous Art by representing effectually to her Majesty the Mischief that the  Italians  do both to her Subjects and to the Arts and so driving those melodious BalladSingers out of the Nation  But to return to the Reign of King  Charles  the Second from which I may seem to have in some measure digress'd there was then indeed a favourable regard shewn to Wit but no real Encouragement  Butler  was starv'd at the same time that the King had his Book in his Pocket Another great Wit lay seven Years in Prison for an inconsiderable Debt and  Otway  dar'd not to shew his Head for fear of the same Fate These are some of the Glories of that Reign according to this Author For if it be a Vice in a Prince to encourage an Art 'tis a Vertue  to neglect it What a wretched Creature is this Pretender to Criticism and Poetry to keep such a pother about an Art the Encouragement of which he imputes as Infamy to King  Charles  the Second  Well but he tells us that not only  The Wits had Pensions but young Lords had Wit  Here in the compass of one poor Line are two devilish Bobs for the Court But 'tis no easy matter to tell which way the latter squinting Reflection looks For if he pretends to reflect upon that Prince for receiving Persons of Quality who had Wit into his Court can any thing be more impertinent than twice in one Line to libel a Monarch for being favourable to that very thing which he takes so much pains in this very Book to recommend to the World If he means that the young Lords of the Court who pretended to Wit had it not can any thing be more arrogant than to fly in the Face of all Mankind and to contradict almost the only thing in which all sorts of People agree ev'n in this divided Age  Britons  and Foreigners Protestants and Papists Whigs and Tories Churchmen and Dissenters and to pretend to reflect upon Persons whose very Names are their Panegyricks The young Lords who had Wit in the Court of King  Charles  the Second are these The young former Duke of  Buckingham  the young Earl of  Mulgrave  now Duke of  Buckingham  the young Lord  Buckhurst  afterwards Earl of  Dorset  and  Middlesex  and the young Marquess of  Halifax  the young Earl of  Rochester  the young Lord  Vaughan  now Lord  Carbury  and several others If the looking favourably upon young Persons of Quality who had Wit may be imputed as Scandal to the Court of King  Charles  the Second that Court was certainly the most scandalous one in  Europe  But if he says on the other side that 'tis dishonourable to a Prince to be mistaken in this Point and to look with a favourable Eye on Pretenders instead of real Masters to that all the World with one accord wlll answer that never Prince had a clearer Reputation in this Point  Thus are his Assertions and his Precepts frequently false or trivial or both his Thoughts very often crude and abortive his Expressions absurd his Numbers often harsh  and unmusical without Cadence and without Variety his Rhimes trivial and common He dictates perpetually and pretends to give Law without any thing of the Simplicity or Majesty of a Legislator and pronounces Sentence without any thing of the Plainness or Clearness or Gravity of a Judge Instead of Simplicity we have little Conceit and Epigram and Affectation Instead of Majesty we have something that is very mean and instead of Gravity we have something that is very boyish And instead of Perspicuity and lucid Order we have but too often Obscurity and Confusion  But what most shews him a very young Author is that with all these Faults and this Weakness he has the Insolence of a Hero and is a downright Bully of  Parnassus  who is ev'ry moment thundr'ing out Fool Sot Fop Coxcomb Blockhead and thinks to hide his want of Sense by his pretended Contempt of others as a Hector does his want of Courage by his perpetual blustring and roaring and is sagaciously of Opinion that he arrogates so much Sense to himself as he imputes Folly to other People  Thus a wild  Tartar  when he spies  A Man that's handsome valiant wise  Thinks if he kills him to inherit  His Wit his Beauty and his Spirit  As if just so much he enjoy'd  As in another he destroy'd  By what he says Page the  th  and his returning to the Charge Page his particular Pique seems to be at People of Quality for whom he appears to have a very great Contempt I mean for the Authors of that Rank as if a Man were to assert his Title to  Parnassus  by proving himself a Plebeian in  Great Britain  or as if an  English  Sovereign by making a Man honourable made him dull Good Gods how absolute would our Princes be at that rate when they would have the very Understandings of their Subjects at their disposal and would need only to prefer the Disobedient to chastise them  I hope I may without offence gently put young Mr  Bays  in mind that the Subordination which is absolutely necessary to the Government of the World requires  that Respect should be paid to Persons of Quality ev'n where Esteem cannot be paid to them but that in this case they both may and ought to have our Respect and Esteem together For I know very few People of Quality who have applied themselves to Poetry who have not succeeded on the other side 'tis known to all the World that some of them have been admirable For nothing is more certain than that supposing equal Talent and equal Application a Man of Quality has great Advantages over the rest of Men But can any thing be more stupidly impudent and impertinent than that this little Gentleman should rail thus at the Writings of People of Quality in this very Essay the one half of which he has borrow'd from two noble Authors and appropriated it to himself by the same Method by which a  Jackpudding  engrosses a Sackposset  viz  by mingling some Beastliness with it which does not fail to render it nauseous to those who made it This extraordinary Proceeding of borrowing and railing puts me in mind of a Passage in Mr  Cowley  'Tis now become the frugal Fashion  Rather to bide than pay the Obligation  Nay Wrongs and Outrages we do  Lest Men should think we Owe  But the Men of Quality as they want not the Discernment will have the Satisfaction to see that as there is a great deal of Venom in this little Gentleman's Temper Nature has very wisely corrected it with a great deal of Dulness  His rankest Libels lull asleep his Foes  As Vipers blood in Treacle makes us dose  As there is no Creature in Nature so venomous there is nothing so stupid and so impotent as a hunchback'd Toad and a Man must be very quiet and very passive and stand still to let him fasten his Teeth and his Claws or be surpriz'd sleeping by him before that Animal can have any power to hurt him  Thus in order to find out his outward Person have we taken a Survey of his inward Man in his several noble Talents  and Vertues his Poetry his Criticism his Modesty his Humility his Gratitude and his good Breeding Let us now take a Survey of his Politicks and his Religion not by any means by way of Reflection for Poetry and Criticism are of no Party and of no Religion but only to find who he is  I find then that in the compass of one Page which is the thirty first he has Libell'd two Monarchs and two Nations The two Monarchs are King  Charles  and King  William  The two Nations are the  Dutch  and our own The  Dutch  we are told are a parcel of Sharpers and we are downright Bubbles and Fools King  Charles  the Second was too much a Libertine and too much an Encourager of Wit for him King  William  the Third was too much a  Socinian  But tho' he has without Mercy condemn'd the Reigns of the foremention'd Monarchs he is graciously pleas'd to pass over in silence that which comes between them In the beginning of the  th  Page we find what that is which so happily reconcil'd him to it and that was the Dispensing Pow'r which was set on foot in order to introduce and to establish Popery and to make it the National Religion Now I humbly conceive that he who Libels our Confederates must be by Politicks a  Jacobite  and he who Libels all the Protestant Kings that we have had in this Island these threescore Years and who justifies the Dispensing Pow'r so long after we are free'd from it a Pow'r which as was hinted above was set on foot on purpose to introduce Popery He who justifies this when he lyes under the Tye of no Necessity nor ev'n Conveniency to approve of it must I humbly conceive derive his Religion from St  Omer  's as he seems to have done his Humanity and his Criticism and is I suppose politickly setting up for PoetLaureat against the coming over of the Pretender which by his Insolence he seems to believe approaching as People of his Capacity are generally very sanguine  Let us now see if we can find any thing in his Rhimes which may direct us to his Coffeehouse or to his Booksellers By his taking three Opportunities to commend Mr  Dryden  in so small a compass as p I fancy we may hear of him at  Shakespear  's Head or at  Will  's for to revive old Quarrels which  have been long out of doors and to renew the memory of Poetical Wars wag'd formerly between Sir  R B  Mr  L M  and Mr  Dryden  can be agreeable to none but a very few of the Frequenters of those Places This is to run counter to his own Direction for he tells us Page that formerly  Pride Malice Folly against  Dryden  rose  In various shapes of Parsons Criticks Beaus  Upon which Page he gives this grave Advice  Be thou the first true Merit to befriend  His Praise is lost who stays till all commend  The appearing in Mr  Dryden  's behalf now is too late 'Tis like offering a Man's self for a Second after the Principal has been whipp'd through the Lungs Now Mr  Dryden  is dead he commends him with the rest of the World But if this little Gentleman had been his Contemporary thirty Years ago why then I can tell a very damn'd shape that Pride and Malice and Folly would have appear'd in against Mr  Dryden  For his Acquaintance he names Mr  Walsh  I had the good Fortune to know Mr  Walsh  very well who was a learned candid judicious Gentleman But he had by no means the Qualification which this Author reckons absolutely necessary to a Critick it being certain that Mr  Walsh  was like this Essayer a very indifferent Poet but he was a Man of a very good Understanding in spight of his being a Beau He lov'd to be well dress'd as  Dorimant  says and thought it no Disparagement to his Understanding and I remember a little young Gentleman with all the Qualifications which we have found to be in this Author whom Mr  Walsh  us'd sometimes to take into his Company as a double Foil to his Person and his Capacity It has been observ'd that of late Years a certain Spectre exactly in the shape of that little Gentleman has haunted a certain ancient Wit and has been by the People of  CoventGarden  styl'd his evil Genius For it hath been extremely remarkable that while that Spectre hath haunted that ancient Wit he has never been able to write  or talk like himself Which has by no means happen'd by any Decay of his natural Parts but by the wonderful Pow'r of Magick For as soon as the dumb Conjurer has been employ'd to lay the Spectre for three or four months either in the midst of the  Red Sea  or the middle of  WindsorForest  the old Gentleman has strait been his own Man as perfectly as ever he was in his Life  And now if you have a mind to enquire between  SunningHill  and  Ockingham  for a young squab short Gentleman with the forementioned Qualifications an eternal Writer of Amorous Pastoral Madrigals and the very Bow of the God of Love you will be soon directed to him And pray as soon as you have taken a Survey of him tell me whether he is a proper Author to make personal Reflections on others and tell him if he does not like my Person 'tis because he is an ungrateful Creature since his Conscience tells him that I have been always infinitely delighted with his So delighted that I have lately drawn a very graphical Picture of it but I believe I shall keep the  Dutch  Piece from ever seeing the Light as a certain old Gentleman in  WindsorForest  would have done by the Original if he durst have been half as impartial to his own Draught as I have been to mine This little Author may extol the Ancients as much and as long as he pleases but he has reason to thank the good Gods that he was born a Modern For had he been born of  Graecian  Parents and his Father by consequence had by Law had the absolute Disposal of him his Life had been no longer than that of one of his Poems the Life of half a day Instead of setting his Picture to show I have taken a keener Revenge and expos'd his Intellectuals as duly considering that let the Person of a Gentleman of his Parts be never so contemptible his inward Man is ten times more ridiculous it being impossible that his outward Form tho' it should be that of downright Monkey should differ so much from human Shape as his immaterial unthinking part does from human Understanding How agreeable it is to be in a Libel with so much good Company as I have been with two great Monarchs two mighty Nations and especially the People of Quality of  Great Britain  and this Libel compos'd by a little Gentleman who has writ a Panegyrick upon himself Which Panegyrick  if it was not writ with Judgment yet was it publish'd with Discretion for it was publish'd in Mr  W  's Name so that by this wise Proceeding he had the Benefit of the Encomium and Mr  W  had the Scandal of the Poetry which it brought upon him to such a degree that 'tis ten to one if ever he recovers the Reputation of a good Versifyer And thus for the present I take my leave of you and of this little Critick and his Book a Book throughout which Folly and Ignorance those Brethren so lame and so impotent do ridiculously at one and the same time look very big and very dull and strut and hobble cheek by jowl with their Arms on Kimbo being led and supported and Bullyback'd by that blind Hector Impudence I am  SIR  Your  c  ANNOTATIONS    First follow Nature  p  Horace  has giv'n a Precept which may be quoted by undistinguishing People to keep this in countenance  Respicere exemplar vitae morum{que} jubebo  Doctum imitatorem veras hinc Ducere voces  For he bids the Person to whom this is directed consult Nature but then he does three things which vastly distinguish him from the Writer of the Essay For first he makes it very plain what sort of Person this is to whom he directs himself and that is  Doctus Imitator  one who is both Poet and Critick Dramatick Poet and Dramatick Critick one who writes Plays and understands the Rules and knows the Secrets of his Art notwithstanding which he may be ignorant of that important one which  Horace  is about to discover to him or in case he does already know it he may want to be put in mind of it because his Interest as we shall find anon is a strong Temptation to deviate from it But secondly  Horace  tells us very intelligibly what he  means by Nature here and that is human Life and the manners of Men Thirdly he makes it as clear as the Sun what it is to follow Nature in giving a draught of human Life and of the manners of Men and that is not to draw after particular Men who are but Copies and imperfect Copies of the great universal Pattern but to consult that innate Original and that universal Idea which the Creator has fix'd in the minds of ev'ry reasonable Creature and so to make a true and a just Draught For as ev'ry Copy deviates from the Original both in Life and Grace and Resemblance a Poet who designs to give a true Draught of human Life and Manners must consult the universal Idea and not particular Persons For Example when a Poet would draw the Character of a covetous or a revengeful person he is not to draw after  Lucius  or  Caius  but to consult the universal pattern within him and there to behold what Revenge or Covetousness would do in such and such Natures upon such and such Occasions For if he draws after  Lucius  or  Caius  the workings of Revenge and Covetousness in these two being but Copies and imperfect Copies of their workings according to the universal  Idea  and the Poet degenerating in his Draught ev'n from those faint and imperfect Copies whenever a just and discerning Judge comes to compare that Draught with the Original within him he immediately finds that that Draught falls extremely short of the Truth of Nature and immediately disapproves of it as a second ungraceful faint unresembling Copy Agreeable to this is that passage of the most discerning Author of the Essay upon Poetry  If once the Justness of each part is lost  Well may we laugh but at the Poet's cost  Thus  Horace  here speaks to the Knowing yet tells them something that several of them want to be taught and several to be put in mind of For it has been a Complaint of Two thousand Years standing that Poets have been us'd to violate their Subjects and to force their Characters out of complaisance to their Actors that is to their Interest Most of the Writers for the Stage in my time have not only adapted their Characters to their Actors but those Actors have as it were sate for them For which reason the  Lustre of the most shining of their Characters must decay with the Actors while those of  Sophocles    Euripides    Terence  and  Ben Johnson  will eternally remain    Still green with  Bays  each ancient Altar stands  p  If Mr  Bays  should say here that by each ancient Altar he does not mean ev'ry ancient Poet but only those few who have been admir'd by all succeeding Ages to this I answer that besides that the Expression will by no means bear this Sense it appears plainly from the two first lines of p that he speaks of the Ancients in general  And tho' the Ancients thus their Rules invade  As Kings dispense with Laws themselves have made  Moderns beware  p  I think nothing can be more plain than that here he prefers all the Ancients before all the Moderns treating the former as so many Monarchs and Legislators at the same time in the Regions of Sense and the latter as so many Slaves Besides that these Verses manifestly relate rather to the indifferent Poets among the Ancients than to those who are admirable for the indifferent ones have most and oftnest invaded the Rules Indeed they have scarce ever observ'd them as  Homer  and  Virgil  have scarce ever transgress'd them  FINIS
