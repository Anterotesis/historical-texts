 COLUMBUS AN HISTORICAL PLAY  ENTERED AT STATIONER'SHALL  COLUMBUS OR A WORLD DISCOVERED  AN HISTORICAL PLAY  AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL COVENTGARDEN  BY THOMAS MORTON  OF THE HONOURABLE SOCIETY OF LINCOLN'SINN  LONDON PRINTED FOR W MILLER OLD BONDSRREET  THE spectator and reader of the following performance will find the manners and customs of  Mexico  and  Peru  introduced as appertaining to the  first discovered natives  of the western worldThis deviation afforded the author an opportunity of introducing manners and customs more congenial to dramatic use and more particularly of presenting from MARMONTEL'S INCAS the pathetic tale of  Cora  and  Alonzo  To MR HARRIS the author offers his acknowledgments for the extreme attention he has paid to this performance and the magnificent decorations he has bestowed on it  For the zeal and talent manifested by the performers the author's best thanks are due  PROLOGUE  WRITTEN BY W T FITZGERALD ESQ SPOKEN BY MR HOLMAN  WHEN famed Columbus nobly dared to brave  The untry'd perils of the Western wave  Ten thousand dangers in his passage lay  Dark was his night and dreary was his day  The rude companions of his bold design  Fatigued with toil against their chief combine  When suddenbursting on th' astonish'd view  A world discovered proved his judgment true  "Yet black ingratitude the Great Man's fate  "Pursued Columbus with envenomed hate  "But minds like his a base degenerate race  "Might meanly persecutebut not disgrace  "The noble soul its energy maintains  "In spite of dungeons tyranny and chains"  The sons of Europe found a guileless race  No fraud was veiled beneath the smiling face  Their manners mild benevolent and kind  Pourtrayed the cloudless sunshine of the mind  Bless'd in their Prince's patriarchal reign  Whose power relieved but ne'er inflicted pain  Their placid lives no fancy'd evils knew  Their joys were many and their wants were few  One custom with their virtues ill agreed  Which made Humanity with anguish bleed  Compelled at Superstition's shrine to bow  The hapless victims of a cruel vow  Their sweetest maids were often doomed to prove  No joy in friendship nor no bliss in love  Yet love and nature cannot be supprest  The sigh will heave and palpitate the breast  For spite of vows which Heaven's wise laws disown  Love sits triumphant on the hearthis throne  And breaks those fetters bigots would impose  To aggravate the sense of human woes  The rigid laws of time and place our bard  In this night's drama ventures to discard  If here he errshe errs with  him  whose name  Stands without rival on the rolls of Fame  Him  whom the passions own with one accord  Their Great Dictator and despotic Lord  Who placed aloft on Inspiration's throne  Made Fancy's magic kingdom all his own  Burst from the trammels which his muse confined  And poured the wealth of his exhaustless mind  Though SHAKSPEARE'S flight no mortal shall pursue  COLUMBUS' story patronized by you  Will yield an off'ring grateful to his dust  A British laurel on a hero's bust  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Columbus  Mr POPE  Alonzo  Mr HOLMAN  Harry Herbert  Mr LEWIS  Doctor Dolores  Mr

HISTORICAL PLAY  ACT I  SCENE I  On one side of the stage a flight of steps with a Portico leading to the Temple of the SunIn the background the sea Time sunrise  Catalpo  and Priests from the Temple who range themselvesthen enter  Orozimbo  they bow to him as he passes  OROZIMBO  prostrating himself to the sun  SOUL of the universe who from they glittering throne beamest immortal splendour as thou hast permitted the stars for their appointed hour to bespangle the veil of night now o'erwhelm all manner of glories in the greatness of thy effulgence and be once more welcom'd by thy devoted servants to delight and bless the worldCatalpo conduct hither the virgin destined to receive a priestess' sacred office  CATALPO  exit and reenters with  SOLASCO  leading in  CORA  Solasco  kneels  Mighty chief  Orozimba  Rise good Solasco  Solasco  I here present the darling of my age to be devoted to the service of our god It will be worse than parting with my life to lose the comforts of her dear societybut the bright sun our glorious deity demands such excellence to be consigned alone to do  him  honourPardon my king an old man's tears but nature will not always without a struggle yield to duty  Orozimbo  Thou hast indeed devoted to thy god a precious treasure but tell me Cora can thy youthful mind freely resign the livelier joys of social life and rest contented in seclusion and tranquillity  Cora  My father's will has ever sway'd my thoughts from the first hour that infant sense cou'd learn obedienceShould he doom my death his mandate would be met with equal resignation  Orozimbo  Thy pious mind which knows to yield such duty to a father will well befit the service of thy godBut hear the sacred tenour of the law which binds a priestess to her duty Should the heart to heaven devoted become the prey of sacrilegious love our law consigns its priestess and the accomplice of her guilt to instant death Her parents and their offspring are pledges for her faith and should her flight elude offended justice their forfeit lives must expiate her crime  Cora  bows to the sun    Now to the altar and record your vows then as our custom is come forth to shine Queen of this festive day  the last you are to know exempt from sacred duty  Exeunt  Cora Solasco  and  Priests  to the Temple  During the latter part of this scene the sun becomes obscured by clouds and thunder and lightning issue from themthe sea much agitated  Catalpho  Great chief behold what envious clouds obscure the glories of our god  Orozimbo  Say Catalpo what mean these bodings  A ship appears from behind a projecting rock  And loWhat monster's that whose wings bear it buoyant on the angry main  A cannon is discharged from the ship  Catalpo  SeeFrom its throat thunder and fire burst forth seeming to brave high heaven  Orozimbo  Be not dismay'dsummon our warriors    to  Cuto  Catalpo let the priests attend  Exeunt  SCENE II  The Country  Enter  Orozimbo  meeting  Cuto  Warriors and Indians  Orozimbo  My people we'll to the shore Should they prove mortal foes we'll meet their thunders or if the engines of infernal power what can virtue fearTrust me the Deity we serve will reassume his splendour and protect his chosen people  Exeunt  SCENE III  A View of an Indian Country  Enter in procession Indian OfficerWarriorsIndian MusicCutoArchersStandard of the Sun CoraPriests

Herbert  and the rest of the Spanish Adventurers  Columbus  lands first with his Sword drawnhe falls and embraces the Earth during which Time there are three Cheers and a discharge of Artillery then the rest follow and come forward  Columbus  First to high Heaven who thus with neverfading honour hath crown'd its poorest servant let me pour forth a heart o'erwhelm'd with gratitude And now begin the important work which heaven has delegated to usErect the sacred banner of our faith  The Cross is erected on one side of the stage  Alonzo  Brave associates join with me in praise of him who hath atchiev'd what ignorance with sapient shrug and satisfied benumbing prudence derided as the chimera of a madman's fancy falling at his feet let us be proud in being first to pay due homage to such surpassing excellence  They all kneel  Columbus  Rise riserather my Alonzo in these arms receive my thanks thou next to heaven my firmest friend Ye men of Spain let what has passed admonish you in what may be to comekeep in your minds the time when we had gained the course which shut out the eastern world how you beat your breasts oppressed  with fear and superstitionHow with womanish tears you bade adieu to life and blubbered out a requiem for your souls then embracing desperation instead of fortitude I was to be your sacrifice and this body which has been your conduct to wealth and honour you would have given to the sea and ignorance and cowardice would have triumphed  Valverdo  Mighty Sir forgive us  Columbus  Freely good ValverdoLet the man stand forth who at a time so fraught with peril first discovered land  Herbert  Coming forward  It was my good fortune  Columbus  Thou art not a Spaniard  Herbert  No your Excellency I am an Englishman and tho' we Englishmen are an odd whimsical set of fellows yet we generally contrive and I trust ever shall to keep a good look out ahead when our superior is in danger  Columbus  Tell me your fortunes  Herbert  My name is Harry Herbert I am descended from as respectable and independent an ancestor as the world can boast an English yeoman but the civil wars leaving my family little which my imprudence soon made less I thought that altho' King Henry was deprived of the honour of this enterprize that did not preclude his subjects so I shipped myself off for Castille where I had just time and cash enough to fall a dozen times in love and into other serapes before I had the honour of embarking on board your Excellency's squadron  Columbus  Herbert thou dost honour to thy country  Herbert  Then Sir I am glad that for once I  am even with it for I am sure my country does honour to me  Indian music without  Roldan  Behold a crowd of people many of whom seem clad in sacred vestmentsTheir dress and standards bespeak them greatly civilized and full of wealth  Enter in procession Indian Warriors bearing a Standard of the Sun  Orozimbo Cora c  Orozimbo  Descends from his car  Strangers who seem to be above the race of mortals instruct us how to honour youIf you be children of the Sun behold our priests who with perfumes and libations will welcome you to his holy temple or if human here are fruits to feed you dwellings to shelter you and garments to clothe you  Columbus  Chief you behold in us the children of mortality but the power we serve in his high mercy has bestowed upon us superior gifts thus thro' unknown seas to brave the imperious surge and to construct engines which can sweep thousands from the earthBut that Deity commands us to proclaim his name with peaceThe King our master wishes to enrich thee and himself this hardy metal useful in all the purposes of life he will exchange for those thy country may produce  Presents a hatchet  Orozimbo  'Tis very strangeThy King much wrongs himselfall we have to render is our gold but that we find so yielding and so useless it were an injury to offer itIndulge the curiosity of a stranger  Orozimbo  with  Columbus Roldan Herbert Nelti Catalpo  c move up the stage  Alonzo  Oft has a tender glance escap'd my eye impell'd by Beauty's power and from my bosom  the soft sigh instinctively has stolenMany a fair Castilian has enforced this test of admiration but now my every sense seems drawn by power magnetic to that lovely saintPermit me fairest creature to express my admiration at the charms which now present themselvestho' all the wonders of a new discovered world display their rival novelties yet now that I behold its first of wonders all else exacts from me as little notice as I I fear have power or merit to command from you  Cora  Strange you wrong yourself and hold me unskilful to distinguish when you suppose desert like yours can pass unnoticedYour praises of the humble Cora tho' they have caused no vain emotion yet ever will the mind receive with pleasure praise e'en unmerited when 'tis bestowed by those who claim our admiration  Alonzo  All that the warmest fancy can depict in the bright colours of ideal excellence can never reach that exquisite perfection nature exhibits how must I bless my happy fortune that bore me to a clime which boasts an ornament like thee  Cora  Aside  What new emotion rises in my breastI fear to ask my heart from whence it springs Oh Cora think of thy sacred duty think of the vow which pass'd thy lips so lately Stranger tho' sacred hospitality commanded me to pay this courtesy yet now a higher duty enjoins me to desist from further converse  Alonzo  Let me entreat one instant  Cora  It must not bemy conduct is controlled by rigid laws FarewellOh Cora what days of wretchedness art thou doom'd to suffer  Aside as she retires to the priests Alonzo  Alonzo  What cou'd she mean "Her conduct is controlled by rigid laws"If she be destined to another my lot is misery  Orozimbo  with  Columbus  coming forward  In harmony and peace I rule a free and happy people and I were unworthy of my kingdom did I not endeavour to the utmost to convert the name of stranger into friend  Exeunt  Orozimbo  and  Columbus  hand in hand Priests follow then  Alonzo Roldan Valverdo c  and the Spanish and Indian soldiers One party bow to the cross the other to the sun  Manent  Herbert  and  Nelti  Herbert  And so my pretty Indian you live very happily  Nelti  Yes all the day long  Herbert  And have you no monks who pray for you dispute with you and burn you alive when you don't think as they do  Nelti  Oh no  Herbert  Poor devils what a way they must be in  Nelti  Don't you come from the other world  Herbert  What you see something angelic about me ehYes my love I come from a little paradise call'd England  Nelti  Is England a world  Herbert  A bit of one but little as it is it somehow contrives to manage all the rest Shou'd you like to live in England  Nelti  O yes I suppose English women arm'd with spears made of that pretty hard iron climb the mountains and destroy the wild bull  Herbert  Destroy the wild bull No my dear our English women find prettier amusement in  encouraging the breed of horned cattlethe use of the pretty hard iron is confined to the men and no great favourite there for I know many flourishers of spontoons who have a cursed antipathy to cold ironWho is that elegant creature you were conversing with  Nelti  Her name is Cora she was this day admitted a priestess of the SunThe handsomest virgins are always selected to sustain that sacred office  Herbert  The handsomest you were then on that account not  Nelti  Did I say the handsomest Oh dear I mean they select the most sedatefor from this day she must never leave the temple or converse with any except the priests  Herbert  Except the priests Go where you will you find those gentlemen always contrive to be well taken care ofwould you like to become a priestess  Nelti  sighing  Last night perhaps I should  Herbert  Charming sensibility and may I my sweet girl interpret that sigh in my favour  Nelti  Ah you will not love me  Herbert  Not love theeBy Magna Charta I'll resign my life fortune and liberty to thee besides I'll bring thee beads cloathes music  Nelti  Ah that is not loveThey only try to please the eye who find their actions cannot touch the heartno presents or toys could influence Neltino not if you were to give her an iron javelin and a tame tiger  Herbert  Indeedvery delicate presents for a young lady  Nelti  aside  I wish I cou'd make him love me how do women in England gain their lover's hearts  Herbert  Generally by using them like dogs for when a woman studiously avoids looking at  a man abuses him on all occasions and is kind to every one else we naturally conclude they love each other to distraction  Nelti  aside  I never can find in my heart to use him illWhat ugly thing is that  Enter  Dolores  and  Bribon  from a boat  Herbert  A doctor of physic who having killed all his patients in the old world except his wife who wou'd never take his medicines has ventured hither in pursuit of new patients new fees and perhaps a new bedfellow  Nelti  And what's the other  Herbert  A lawyer and a coxcomb  Nelti  What's a coxcomb  Herbert  A reptile my dear that is found in abundance in all countries and yet is not easily describedit is a kind of mongrel which men drive from them because they hardly consider it as belonging to them and the women won't receive because they think it won't breed  Dolores  All seems pretty quietI say Bribon  Bribon  What do you say Doctor Dolores  Dolores  This seems cursed mild wholesome unprofitable air for a physicianBut heaven is merciful wherever I go patients increase  Bribon  There seems plenty of gold and plenty of gold plenty of law follows as naturally as a bill of costsI say Doctor do you see that sweet pretty wealthylooking girl  Dolores  I fancy I shall have some pretty female practice hereI was a great favourite in Spain for my maxim was always to stick to my friends to the last  Herbert  Doctor welcome to the new world So you kept on board till all was quiet  Dolores  To be sureconsider the importance of my life to you all but my chief reason was that the famous astrologer Doctor Diego Diablasco told me something ill would happen if I were rashbut there seems no dangerthat's a very pretty girl and I love a fine young girl almost as much as I do fine old gold  Herbert  And have you Doctor so soon forgot your old helpmate in Valladolid  Dolores  Ah poor old Dorothy But Lord I hate constancy as much as I hate health  addressing Nelti  Permit me sweetest of savages to enquire after the state of your healthhow is your pulse let me feel how it beatsbeats  Takes her hand  Nelti  Feel how it beats Perhaps it beats harder than you think  Dolores  Then there's the more necessity I should feel it my pretty pretty  Nelti  There then  Strikes him  Dolores  Zounds a dozen such patients wou'd do for me  Herbert  Doctor I hope to be honoured with the  hand  of this charming girl  Dolores  Oh with all my heartI'm sure  I've  had enough of itbut you can't marry her  Herbert  Why thou professor of the glorious art of manslaughter  Dolores  Because the Pope allows no religious ceremonies with hereticksall dealings with them must be in the way of plunder and glorious intrigue  Herbert  The Pope pshawI shall sit down here for life contented with a littleI'll build a neat convenient house after the fashion of the country with a plain silver door and a diamond knocker The apartments shall be merely lined  with plates of gold neatly carvedthe sophas of silver tissue and stuffed with the down of hummingbirds As for frescowork of emeralds rubies pearls amethysts and such nicknacks my wife may ornament her dairy and dressingroom with themin short I'll have every thing in a snug comfortable way without shew or expence  Dolores  Without shew or expencePray great Sir will you allow a poor man to gather up the chips and now and then take a peep into your  golden  apartments  Herbert  Why Dolores by the time I build I fancy you'll have a snug  leaden  apartment of your ownso go count beads instead of ducats and try not to cheat  young  Harry out of his mistress but  old  Harry out of your soul  Exeunt  Herbert  and  Nelti  Bribon  Zounds let's follow for who knows but in a minute these savages may knock my brains out with one of your shinbones  Dolores  Come alongOh I wish I had the doctoring of you for a week you English mastiff  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  The Spanish Camp  Enter  Columbus  with a party of soldiers guarding others chained meeting  Roldan  and  Valverdo  Columbus  UNGRATEFUL men thus in a moment to destroy my brightest hopessee them closely guarded  Exeunt Soldiers guarded  Roldan would thou think it those wretches dead to prudence as to honor have damn'd the name of Spaniard they have reviled the Indian priests and with unmanly outrage have torn away the golden ornamen's that decked the lovely breasts of innocenceThe men exasperated call to the Cacique for vengeance I at the hazard of my life must follow and appease his just resentment  Exit  Valverdo  Shall then a brave Castilian be disgraced with bonds for shewing disrespect to vile idolatry  Roldan  No ValverdoSoon shall this upstart Genoese Columbus feel the just vengeance of insulted Spain  shewing a paper  My brother in ambition look on this paper  Valverdo  What's thisthe royal signature  Roldan  Mark meWhen our gracious Queen embraced the fortunes of this foreign Viceroy  even proffered her regal ornaments to equip his fleet the minister Fonesca jealous of the fame that might attend this enterprise worked on the fears of the suspicious Ferdinand to execute this commission of control which now Columbus' conduct gives pretence arrays me with the power of crushing his authority and with disgrace returning him to Spain  Valverdo  Glorious hearing  Roldan  Do thou Valverdo tamper with the troops press on their superstitious minds the injury our faith will suffer by winking at idolatry tell them the way to sudden wealth is easy had they a fit commanderinsinuatebut we waste wordsabout it good Valverdo  Exit  Valverdo  'Twere presumption to instruct a monk in wiles of glozing cozenage  Retires up the stage  Enter  Alonzo  The fatal wound is given to all my hopeswhat years of bliss had my soul fondly pictured as Alonzo's lotOh lovely Cora must then thy beauties never more beam their bright radiance on me Had'st thou been doom'd to fill another's arms I had indeed been cursed but not so deeply for I might still have gazed upon thy heavenly form have listened to the sweet melody of thy loved voice and known delight even in miseryBut all is gloomy horror now before me  Roldan  I hope I not untimely interrupt your meditations  Alonzo  Roldan the conduct of these Indians obscures our European virtues and we are come to be instructed not to teachThe good Columbus has appeased their just resentment and at the request of Orozimbo consents to liberate the prisoners  Roldan  'Tis well  shews a plan of attack  but as we must secure a place of safety for it were madness to repose confidence in savages here have I drawn a plan which must render the town an easy capture  Alonzo  The town a capture  Roldan  Dost thou not understand me  Alonzo  I hope I do not  Roldan  There is no safety but in their destruction  Alonzo  Roldan thou surely can'st not be so damn'd as think itWhat stab the fond heart which overflows with love and adoration for thee trample down sacred hospitality and erect the throne of treachery and murderby the great God of justice first thro' this body thou must force thy way thou traitor to humanity  Roldan  Softhearted fool these mawkish virtues have ever been the sainted garb of cowards  Alonzo  Coward  They fight  Enter  Cuto  with Indians who rush in between'em  Cuto  Thanks to the God this arm receiv'd the stroke that wou'd have slain thee  To Roldan  Alonzo  Good youth thou bleed'stPray take all care of him  binds his handkerchief round  Cuto'  s arm  Roldan if yet thou need'st a stimulus to virtue look on that Indian and in the name of heaven stain not thy honour and thy manhood with treachery and ingratitude  Roldan  Fortune permits thee now to school mebut boy thou shalt feel my power go to the Viceroy tell him that Roldan lacketh brotherly affection for the poor Indians and add for by the power of vengeance it is true that Roldan is his covenanted foethat he hath given  freedom to those Castilians he dared disgrace with bonds and that by thee he greets his Excellency with defiance and contempt  Exit Roldan  Alonzo  Perfidious bloody villain Oh my friends dangers I fear await youI blush to say we have among us those whose vileness your pure nature cannot image Let us prepare to meet the worstsummon your warriors while I instruct them how best to guard each place of 'vantageand should this Roldan attempt to execute his villainous intent depend on the protection of Columbus  Exit  Alonzo  with Indians  SCENE II  A Retired Place  Enter  Columbus  Columbus  All happiness is mingled with alloy I've triumphed over every opposition malice and folly raised to check my gloryI now in Europe's eye shall stand arrayed in all the honours which success commands  those who if accident had thwarted my reasonfounded schemes would with important ignorance have scoffed at the silly vague projectorwill now with panegyric full as thoughtless admire my courage and applaud my prescience  yet when I have attained the summit of my wishes when I shou'd give some little rest to my careworn mind which long has struggled with adversity when I might contemplate with joy the virtues I have found in this new world virtues more rare than all the riches it abounds in I sind I have conducted to this hapless spot hearts black with discontent and factious jealousy thirsting for plunder and for blood But if determined rigourvirtuous example  Enter  Herbert  running  Herbert  May it please your ExcellencyI beg your excusebut I am so choaked with rage and breathless with running that I have scarce power to tell youyour troops have mutinied  Columbus  Mutinied Explain  Herbert  Roldan Sir thatbut I know a soldier's duty too well to speak ill of a superior officer or I'd tell your Excellency what a cursed inhuman scoundrel I think himTheir villainy and ingratitude is beyond beliefthey murmur that you won't give them leave to cut the throats of these innocent IndiansThey call for Roldan to head them and I'll do him the justice to say he would let them indulge in such pretty harmless diversion as long as there was a throat left in the country  Columbus  This demands my instant presence Herbert in half an hour attend me at the camp  Exit  Herbert  Oh if I had that Roldan in England I'd hang him up without judge or jurytho' on recollection I have fixed on the worst place in the world for hanging folks up because a great man like me wills it  but now for vengeance and yet I don't know how it happens that altho' in some things I am a tolerably active industrious fellow yet when I have to seek revenge I grow so infernally lazy I can scarce find in my heart to set about it  Exit  SCENE III  The Sea Coasta boat stationed  Enter  Roldan  with Troops meeting  Valverdo  Roldan  May I trust that look propitiousOh let thy words confirm ithow hast thou prospered with the soldiers  Valverdo  They more than met my wishes and the dastard few whom conscience kept in doubt I soon won over by the stimulus of plunder spiced with our Church's dispensationin a word they have all sworn that on a signal given they will desert Columbus  Roldan  And in an hour to a fairer promiser wou'd they abandon  me  It mads me that I must climb the heights of proud ambition on the shoulders of such a crew of mongrelsMy design is to send Columbus loaded with chains and accusation a prisoner to Spain and with him those henhearted fools whose superstitious scruples might prove troublesome  Valverdo  With deference to your happier policy do you not risk by this the wrath of Isabella  Roldan  Not a whit For unless Valverdo thou hast made some saint thy enemy who in mere spite may work for them a miracle they'll not fatigue the royal ear with much complaining To be plain the vessel which shall convey them hence is so strained crazy and unfit for service she cannot weather out the slightest storm therefore the first rude wind that blows will send them to explore  another  worldBut hark that trumpet speaks ColumbusNow fortune be my friend  Enter  Columbus Moscoso  and Troops  Columbus  Roldan what means this outrage this treason to thy King Why spur on to desperation and rebellion your few mistaken followers whom my power did I not abhor revenge could in an instant sweep from the earth  Roldan  Columbus on  thee  let me retort the name of traitorI stand here chosen by the general voice the avenger of their wrongs 'Tis thee they charge with treason to their King assert thou wink'st at heresy and hast made them the slaves of savagesHow dost thou answer  Enter  Herbert  Columbus  Answer to theeRoldan press not my patience fartherBut to convince thee traitor how false are thy aspersions and that I reign sovereign in my people's lovemark me be this the test  Takes a spear from one of the soldiers and throws it between him and  Roldan  dividing the stage  Let all who do not in their hearts believe I mean them fairly and judge thee worthier to command them pass that javelin without fear or doubtBe that the barrier betwixt my influence and thine  Roldan  Much it glads me thou hast proffered so fair a trial and I swear if they approve thee I will resign into thy hand my sword and life  Columbus  Now my brave soldiers hear my firm intent I will lead you on to wealth but not by massacre I'll make you all the wonders of the world rich and belovedThen without controul decide your fate but remember you have but one step to make from honor to disgrace  Valverdo  and those on  Columbus's  side pass over to  Roldan  Columbus  Be it somen without hearts are not worth regretting  Herbert  who has been standing on  Roldan's  side after eyeing with contempt those who deserted  Columbus  passes between the front of the stage and  Roldan  to  Columbus  Herbert  Great Sir accept my humble services despise not him who honours youpray excuse these tearslet me embrace your knees  Falls and embraces his knees  Columbus  My heart my heartHerbert thy gratitude unmans me  Embraces him  Roldan  Now Columbus look on that paper by it thou'lt find thy King distrusted thee  giving the paper  And pray you all remember I exerted not the high authority of which my sovereign thought me worthy 'till he was deserted and despised  Columbus  Peace fiery indignationdown rebel heart and do not choak my utterance Well Viceroy  giving his staff to Roldan  where are your racks your instruments of vengeance  Roldan  Oh do not fearwe mean no torture  Columbus  And think'st thou villain the subtilest inquisitor who has outdamn'd his fellows in inventive cruelty could give a pang like that I feel in seeing thee possessed of power to make the happy wretchedOh my poor Indians who shall now defend you when this traitor fit leader of his band of daemons like the archfiend new lighted on a world of innocence shall diffuse his devilish spirit and extend hell's empire  Roldan  Bring forth his chains  Columbus is chained  for so the King enjoin'd he shou'd be sent to Spain whenever he proved unworthy  Herbert  Chains Hell and fury  draws his sword but is disarmed  Confusion  Roldan  Captain observe that with strict attention you obey your orders  pointing to Herbert  for that stubborn rebelbear him to torture  Columbus  Hold Roldanthy vengeance must be most complete when I descend to ask a favour from theelet my humility glut thy vindictive wrathAllow that Englishman to share my fortunes  Roldan  Bear him away  Columbus  Roldan a wretch like thee should have a coward's cautionDost thou not dread that in his dying moments when in defiance of thy tortures for I can read his noble soul he braves thee to the last and glories in a death of honour dost thou not fear he may infect this ruffian crew with some faint sparks of honesty and make them less fit instruments for thee  Roldan  Bear him to death  Herbert  Heaven preserve your Excellency Will you great Sir condescend to indulge the last wish of vanity and when you have nothing else to do write to England the story of my fate that when my fortunes shall be enquired after my friends with joy sparkling thro' a tear may say Herbert stuck to his commander to the last and died as an Englishman ought  Columbus  My noble fellow this hand shall justify thy fame  Herbert  Then I am easyMay your portion of happiness be equal to your virtuesfarewell  To  Roldan  Perhaps Sir you never were at the death of an English gamecockWill you do me the favour of attending my execution  Roldan  Take him from my sight  Herbert  Hands off reptiles  to  Roldan  That you are the most infernal scoundrel the devil ever made a friend of all your worthy associates about you will I dare say allowbut I brand you with the name of fool for enabling an humble man like me thus to triumph over you to defy you scorn youlaugh at youHands off reptiles  Exit  Herbert  guarded  Columbus  to Roldan  Is then my triumph for a world's discovery and the trophies which I bear to Spain to tell attending crowds my glory a body bowed by ignominious fetters  Captain  Pardon me Sir if I presume to beg that I may so far mitigate their rigour as when on board to free the noble prisoner from their weight  Columbus  You know not what you askwish me to forfeit the honours my King has heaped on meno these are his gracious gifts and I've not yet learnt to disobey himand here I vow before that power who cheers the soul of suffering virtue tho' their cankerous rivets corrode my very bones no hand but Ferdinand's shall free me from them By heaven my soul pants for the moment when thus accoutered I may meet his presence and ask himhow I have deserved these favours from him  Officer  All is ready  Roldan  Bear him then on board  Exeunt  Roldan  and Troops  Columbus  Thou guardian of the innocent to thy supreme protection I commend the generous natives of this hapless land assist them to defend  their liberties from the fell grasp of this detested crewTo them extend thy mercy and let me pour my thanks for that celestial fortitude which glows within my breastwith it I can defy the storms of fortune safe in the approval of a guiltless mind which not deserving wrong can never feel disgrace  Exeunt  Columbus  and Attendants to the Boat  Enter  Orozimbo Alonzo  and Indian Warriors  Alonzo  rushes to the top of the Stage  Alonzo  Great chief your succours come too latealas he's gone Oh for vengeance on that traitor Roldanmay this arm drive him from the earth which groans at bearing such a wretch and hurl him to the infernal gulph as yet untenanted by any fiend so cursed  Orozimbo  Alonzo dost thou not blush to call these wretches countrymen who spurn at sacred virtue and seem to court preeminence in perdition  Alonzo  Spain thou hast lost thy glorypride and fanaticism have rear'd their bloody banner and virtue flies to foreign climes for shelter Orozimbo to thee and to thy country I dedicate my lifeHark  Cannon discharged  The cannon's ireful throat wont proudly to proclaim defiance now throws along the wave a solemn sound as knolling a departed friend  Enter  Herbert  without his Cloak and Doublet  Herbert  I have escaped the bloodhounds Zounds how I scamperedI never before knew  I was so eminently gifted with that fashionable military accomplishment retreating  Alonzo  What means this strange appearance  Herbert  I'll tell youthat cannibal Roldan was I believe a little inclined to be dainty and wishing for a choice bit consigned me over to Valverdo who stood mancook on the occasion he ordered me to be scored like pork and then to be roasted and the humane priest remarked there was not so excellent a receipt for insuring the love of heaven as taking half a dozen hereticks and broiling them gently over a slow fire Acknowledge Roldan Viceroy says heI'd see you damn'd first says Iso watching my opportunity I gave the priest a Cornish hug shewed his scullions a specimen of English wrestling and off I came trussed for dressing as you see me  Alonzo  Well my brave friend thou then wilt aid our cause  Herbert  Do you suppose that I who had my forefathers chopped to atoms in deciding the preference between a red rose and a white one will stand idle in the cause of humanityNo give me a sword and if I don't without benefit of clergy execute that priest Valverdo whom the devil has sent hither as his plenipotentiary make me commander in chief to all the cowards in Europe  Alonzo  to Orozimbo  Act in pursuance of the plan I gave and with a rampart circle in the town then let but hunger that harbinger of mutiny once assail them they like opposing poisons will soon destroy each other and save your darts the labour  Orozimbo  Trust me brave people these gods are vulnerablesoon shall you behold your javelins burnished with their bloodhunger and thirst is their's as well as our's and the soul of a Spaniard takes its flight from a wound as swiftly as an Indian'sLead on  Exeunt  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  The Temple of the Sun  Catalpo  and Priests assembled round the Altar Enter  Orozimbo  and  Alonzo  Orozimbo  MATCHLESS infamy how could the villain Roldan think so poorly of me the tender of his friendship was sufficient insult without the terms on which he offers it Resign thee to him purchase by treachery the friendship of a traitor and for what Had he the power to raise me above all the glories ambition ever coveted should I not after such a crime sit pining 'midst my splendour the victim of accusing conscience finding a curse in every blessing  Alonzo  My heart burns with impatience to lead your valiant troops to just revengebut let vigilance and caution guide us  Orozimbo  My friend do thou direct us at thy will  to the priests  prepare the rites the sacrifice for war and let the priestess who was last received a servant of the Sun approach the altar with her sacred present  The priests range round the altarfoldingdoors open and priestesses enter and range on each side  Cora  enters bearing offerings in a golden basket  Alonzo  'Tis she'tis Corasupport me heaventhis unexpected sight o'erpowers me    Aside  Cora  not seeing  Alonzo  advances and kneels at the altar  Thou glorious Sun accept our humble offeringsreceive with favour the righteous homage of our grateful heartsIf thy children e'er have broken the laws of hospitality if ever they have failed to greet a stranger with a brother's love they nor deserve nor dare to hope thy fatherly protectionbut if they have not merited the wrongs they suffer preserveprotect them  Priests and priestesses prostrate themselves  Catalpo  takes from the altar an Indian weapon and gives it to  Cora  Catalpo  Priestess bear to our chief this consecrated weapon it shall defend the Sun's insulted glory our sovereign's and his people's rights  Cora  receives the weapon and in bearing it to  Orozimbo  sees  Alonzo  exclaims  "Oh heavens"  drops the weapon and faints  Alonzo  endeavours to assist her  Catalpo  to Alozo  Forbearthe proffered kindness claims our thanks but thy unhallowed hand wou'd be a profanation to a priestess' sacred person  Orozimbo  What means this tremorWhat shock so suddenly has struck that lovely frame  Cora  I know nota momentary weakness  Cora  is borne off by the priestesses  Orozimbo  Let all attention wait her'tis but the effect of apprehension from her inexperience in her sacred office  Alonzo  She seemed much agitatedHow shall I bear this aggregate of miserymy agony I fear will speak what shou'd be hid from all  Aside  Orozimbo  to the priests  Conclude your rites and may the power supreme accept our fervent prayers and be our humble offerings grateful to him  The Scene closes  SCENE II  An Indian Town  Enter  Dolores  and  Bribon  Dolores  I tell you this new world is crammed with wizzards and astrologers that whiz about in the night time raising storms tempests and mischief and can

Well well I am satisfiedI am of a sweet dispositionI have murdered many a man without bearing him the least ill will  Roldan  Who is that Indian  Moscoso  I don't know but he's a damn'd saucy one and

a Quipos  Herbert  Forgive thee my angelname not the wordI like a woman to be a little whimsical in trifles as long as she has the stamina of affection at bottomI am for none of your still quiet good sort of women that make a man's life one continued dead calm nonorefreshing breezes for mewhen one is sure not to be driven by them on the rocks of aversion they render the voyage of life free from languor and insipidity  Nelti  Rest assured every future breath of mine shall speak only affection and esteembut my Herbert to owe my life to thy protecting arm is such joy as makes me spite of its awful horrors bless last night which thus restor'd thee to my aching heart  Herbert  My charming girl Egad I thought it was all over with us  Nelti  Oh Herbert what uneasy hours have I passed and what melancholy thoughts have been put into my headlook here  shewing the Quipos  Herbert  Who gave you thiswhat do you call it  Nelti  One of our necromancers  Herbert  Necromancersha ha ha  Nelti  Every body believes in themthey say they can raise storms and thundercan tell whose lives are joined together  Herbert  Lives joined togethera curious doctrine  Nelti  But I'll never trust them again  Herbert  No my dear trust only to me and you'll certainly not have to deal with a  conjuror  Nelti  Here come those frights Dolores and BribonI shou'd like to plague 'em dearly  Herbert  Shou'd you you rogueEgad what you have told me about necromancers and the strange opinion of your country that people's lives are joined together has given me an idea which will plague them confoundedly  for their credulity in astrology is equal to their professional ignorance  This way and I'll explain  Retire up the stage  Enter  Dolores  and  Bribon  quarelling  Dolores  Why do you keep following me and chattering your cursed jargon  Bribon  I'll walk where I like and talk what I like  "Dolores  Very trueas nature here asserts her rights of course monkies have privilege to chatter without fear of correction but  to  compare your paltry profession with the noble art of healing  Bribon  Why to say the truth Doctors do put people out of their misery  Dolores  Come that's better than lawyers who put them into misery and leave them there  Bribon  Call in a physician he kills or nature cures  Dolores  True but call in a lawyer and egad kill or cure right or wrong is equally fatal  seeing  Herbert  Zounds there's Herbert tush be quietlet's listen  Herbert  and  Nelti  come forward  Herbert  You amaze me Can it be possible that your necromancers are so very potent  Nelti  True indeed my love  Herbert  This union of lives is very wonderful and doubtless very trueIf old Dolores knew that his life depended on another's fate how anxious wou'd he be to know whose  Dolores  and  Bribon  run forward and interrupt him  Dolores  I am very anxious  Bribon  I'd give half my estate to know it  Dolores  Lives linked togetheroh I've heard of it  Bribon  So have Iit's a wonderful discovery  Dolores  To be sure it isWhy it accounts at once for those cursed unprofitable apoplexies What's that catonine tails  Nelti  These varied coloured braids explain every thing as your books do  Herbert  By these knotty hieroglyphics the necromancers expound the decrees of fateObserve  Dolores  Keep offI would not touch it for the worldthe idea makes me paralytic  I hope my partner for life is one of these fine healthy Indianslong life to the worthy creatures I love them in my heart and so I ought are not all mankind a kin to one another  Herbert  So Roldan and his crew seem to think for they treat the Indians exactly like poor relations  Bribon  I'm exceedingly alarmedwonder who they could find to couple with a lawyer's soul Sweetest of womenif you would condescend to enquire  Dolores  Oh if you would obtain from the necromancer one of these conjuring things to inform me who is interested in my unhappy lot I'd pray for youI'd go to the devil for you I'd  Nelti  And never again teaze me with love  Bribon  Nevernever  Dolores  I'll hate you as long as I live  Nelti  Then meet me presentlyyou see yonder cave  Dolores  Yes  Nelti  That's the dwelling of the necromancer  Dolores  I won't go thereI would not see his devilship for the fame of AEsculapius  Bribon  Nor I to be the Lycurgus of the new world  Nelti  Well then I'll take care you shall not see himso follow me and I'll get you information will set your hearts at ease  Exit  Bridon  I declare what she has said has made me so ill I can scarce standOh lord I am afraid my accomplice is going  Dolores  Come Bribon forget and forgive  gives him a phial  and as you are ill there's a pretty tasteless medicine that I'm sure will do you good my dear friendDam'me but there's a dose for you however  Aside and exit  Bribon  to Herbert  And does that old fool think I'd ensure death by taking his cursed potions ah Sir there is no way to deal with doctors  Herbert  I beg your pardon give them fees while you are well and nothing when you are ill and they are not the mischievous animals you think them  Bribon  If the necromancer will but speak the truth  Exit  Herbert  Ha ha already I've perform'd a miraclefor there go a physician and a lawyer wishing to sind among men health and sincerity This partnership of liver is a whimsical kind of doctrine and yet absurd as it seems I feel it not altogether untrue for were my Nelti to die I believe Herbert thy life wou'd not be worth many days  Exit  SCENE IV  The inside of an Indian house  Enter  Dolores  Dolores  How anxious I am to know whom my precious life is joined toAh here comes Nelti Tell me my dear girl  Enter  Bribon  Get out of my way  Bribon  I tell you what old Hellebore I'll Ah here she comesnow for it  Enter  Nelti  with a Quipos  Dolores  Sweetest

sage on whose life depends that of old Doctor Dominic Dolores says he Has he not a decrepid formwithered facesunk eyespugnosepaper lipsleather cheeksstraggling teethsays I the description suits exactlyHe then gave me this which informs me your life is joined to  Dolores  Whom  Bribon  I hope some rascal who will be hang'd in a week  Nelti  Very likely for it is joined to a lawyer's and his name isBribon  with deliberation and seeming to expound the Quipos  when one dies the other will inevitably expire  Bribon  Oh lud Oh lud  Dolners  Oh dear Oh dear  Nelti  I see I've made you quite happyso good bye  Exit laughing  Dolores  Oh cruel fate that my precious life must depend on my mortal enemyI can't bear it  Bribon  To be in the same deathwarrant with that old superannuated villainOh 'tis too much  They each sit down lamenting look at each other some timefirst with fear and anxiety then they smile and draw nearer to each other  Dolores  I think it was ridiculous enough in us to quarrel about a silly girl Eh Bribon  Bribon  Very Doctor just as if there were not unavoidable miseries enough in life without making them  Dolores  Truehow do you do  Bribon  You don't look well  Dolores  My dear friend let me feel your pulse Oh lord 'tis very quick  Bribon  Dear Doctor sit down  Dolores  I say Bribon you did not may be happen to swallow the contents of the bottle I gave

not offended with youperhaps it is well as it is  Bribon  What an old villain If I thought it would not endanger his life I would plague him  heartily  aside  I don't think my dear Doctor you look ill  Dolores  Ill I never was better in my life  Bribon  Egad I willI'll plague him  aside  and thank heaven the cordial you gave me and which I have just swallowed  Dolores  greatly alarm'd  Why you did

guilty breastOh give me death it will at once to thee be vengeance and to me be mercy  Solasco  I seek not vengeance vengeance is for weaker woesBut tell me how could'st thou heap such anguish on a heart that never injured thee  Alonzo  Oh father let me call thee so wring not my soul thus  I love thy daughter with a flame pure as her virtues think then what I must feel and even thou may'st pity me  Solasco  If thou dost truly love my hapless child e'en in the midst of all my woes my bosom owns one pang for theeThe torments of my Cora soon must endThine alasbut let me not encrease the sorrows I could wish to soothe Farewellobey my dying child and grant her all the joy she now can tasteto know that thou art safe  Alonzo  Think'st thou I am base enough to live the monument of her destruction and my own disgraceNo if  my  life cannot alone appease your violated laws let me at least partake my Cora's doom and in a fond embrace expiring I'll bless the fate that e'en in death unites us  Solasco  Our law allows no partial mitigation leave her to meet the doom thou can'st not save her from and do thou bear life a little longer to give unhappy Cora in her dying pangs one ray of comfort  Alonzo  Oh my father  Solasco  Farewell farewell my son and if thou can'st be happy heaven can tell I wish thee so  Exit  Alonzo  Now then the sum of horror is complete  Indian instrument sounds  Enter  Orozimbo  attended  Orozimbo  Alonzo thy aid is now our chief relianceRoldan prepares to attack us and since the good Columbus left our coast thro' many tedious months of care and danger thy counsel and thy valour still have been defence and safety to us But why droops the brave Alonzo If any tender scruple of shedding native blood now check thy wonted ardour freely avow the generous weakness On thee depends our fate yet would I welcome the loss of empire and of life rather than save them by Alonzo's misery  Alonzo  NoWith honest zeal I draw my sword against the enemies of innocence tho' the same clime hath bred usHe who regards his country's real honour owns for his countrymen none but the virtuousYet Orozimbo this heart is bursting with its anguish  Orozimbo  Thy sorrows tho' I am unconscious of the cause have found their way into my kindred breastTell me thy griefs that I may soothe perhaps relieve them  Alonzo  Thou thou alone hast power to do it  Orozimbo  Then by my kingdom thou shalt find relief  Alonzo  Looking round  Command that all remain at distance  Orozimbo  Retire  Troops retreat to the back of the stage  Alonzo  Points to the Temple  Behold those walls does thy exalted mind which owns the noblest energies of reason does it approve that structure reared by mistaken zeal to glorify the Deity by the dire sacrifice of all his dearest blessings  Orozimbo  Say on  Alonzo  Does she who in the prime of youth when every fine affection of the soul glows with its noblest fervour when all the joys of life seem decked with magic splendour does she deserve the punishment of guilt who buried in yon' ruthless prison casts a fond thought on the delights she has lost dares to condemn the tyranny which binds her and claims her right to liberty and love  Orozimbo  I would aspire to reign beyond the limits of weak prejudice but reflect Alonzo how sacred are a country's customs  Alonzo  There there's the source of half the misery of human kindcustom is the vile confounder of virtue and of viceIt checks the operation of our godlike reason and makes the greatest glory of creation a being void of will Oh Orozimbo soar superior to the mists of error when thy great soul displays unmanacled its glorious attributesthou'lt cease to think that God delights in cruelty whose blest infusion in the human heart breathes mercy and benevolence  Orozimbo  Oft have I admired thy wisdom and thy virtue but now methinks in thee I hear the voice of heaven and it shall be obeyed But I must praise thy wonderous goodness which can thus plead for other's misery  Alonzo  There I am unworthy of thy praise mine is a selfish zealI've sued for one whom I adore nay for myself I've suedOh Orozimbo in the repeal of an inhuman law thou hast restored my forfeit lifenay morethe life of her I love  Orozimbo  What do I hear  Enter  Cuto  Cuto  Great chief the foe is on their march your warriors are assembled anxious for your presence to lead them to victory  Orozimbo  On my friends  Alonzo  One moment stayLest the fell chance of war which heaven avert shou'd leave my lovely Cora without the generous friend she has found in thee first let me bear your royal mandate to the temple strictly commanding whatever fate may in the battle wait us pardon and liberty for her  Orozimbo  I must in person give the important mandateLead on the troops  to Alonzo  and I with speed will join you  to the troops  I leave you to the conduct of the brave Alonzo  Orozimbo  goes towards the temple  Alonzo  heads the troops    Exeunt  SCENE III  A Battle

Herbert  Saved by a woman's handshe faints the spirit which animated her to preserve me now sinks beneath the weight of its own effort Good heaven can it be'Tis Nelti  Hugging her  Nelti  Oh Herbert joy has almost the same effect that terror had and I am scarce able to bear the excess of happiness your safety gives me  Herbert  My dear angelic girl I am in such transport I scarcely know whether I

and our retreat cut offThis waythis way  Exeunt a troop of Spaniards pursuing  SCENE THE LAST  A garden of the Temple of the Sunat the upper end an arch  Enter  Catalpo  and priests  Catalpo  Tho' I receiv'd with all apparent reverence the mandate of the King to spare the impious priestess I but dissembled to preserve our sacred rites inviolatehad I opposed the hated order his power would have rescued from our grasp the object of our vengeance  Priest  But say Catalpo does no doubt remain of this young priestess' crime For by our chief's command to spare her life he surely  her innocent  "Catalpo  There can exist no doubtOn the  which followed that dreadful night when  e dire war of elements diffused such general horror Blessco whose truth none yet e'er doubted beheld her conducted to the temple by one of these hated strangers with whom she parted  with every mark of fond endearmentLong he concealed this till at length his conscience sorely wounded by the guilt he secreted he on his oath declared to me this profanation  Instant conduct the offender to her doom  Enter priests conducting  Cora  in procession with archers and  Solasco  Solasco  falling on his knees  Oh reverend priest on my devoted head let fall the vengeance of the offended lawthe crime was mine I heeded not the tears which trickled down my Cora's angelface I listened not to the reproving sighs which forced their way from her lamenting bosom but deaf to nature's voice compelled her to dedicate her youth to solitude and misery  Catalpo  Hence nor offer further insult to offended heaven by pleading for a wretch who braves its laws  Solasco  Sure heaven will pardon a poor old man who pleads for mercy to his childthe offence was mine then take my forfeit life but save O save my Cora  Catalpo  Retire for tho' no pray'rs shall urge me to neglect the duty which I owe to heaven I do not wish a father's eyes to view the shedding of his daughter's blood  Solasco  And does thy piety thy filial love then doom thee to destruction Cursed Solasco how worthless art thou of thy childthy injustice devoted her to misery and in return she dooms herself to death to save her cruel father's life  Cora  throws herself round his neck  Catalpo  Dost thou still with impious stubbornness persist to keep concealed the partner of thy guilt Say who it was seduced thy innocence  Cora  Oh for mercy spare me so dire a thoughtShall I be his accuserOh bless preserve him Heaven  Catalpo  This instant meet thy fate  Enter  Cuto  What rash foot dares unbidden to approach the sacred Temple  Cuto  I wish my tidings did not justify intrusion Reverend Priest freedom is lostthe barbarous foe hath conquered  Catalpo  to Cora  Thou hast armed the hand of Heaven against usits indignation falls on ourheads in vengeance for thy crime  Lead to her death  Cora  as they seize her  Holddoth Alonzo live  Cuto  He was too brave for lifeWith ardour more than human he sought the fiercest dangers of the fight and hurled destruction round him but at length hemmed in by numbers more than mortal arm could force he must have fallen to swell the horrors of this dreadful day  Cora  Then welcome death  fixed in a posture of despair  Catalpo  Ha it must be sothe secret is revealed  Cora  Lead me to my fateYour cruelty will now be mercyMy soul's impatient to throw off this load of life eager to join the spirit of my lord

a sound reproachful to my Alonzo's memory lest I forget the calm solemnity this awful moment claims and pour on thee my curses  Catalpo  To death with her and thou old man this instant quit the Temple or behold thy daughter bleed  Solasco  Farewell my child I'll weep no more This bursting heart will soon force out a passage for my soul to take its slight and follow thee  Embraces Cora and Exit  The ceremony takes place the Archers range and Cora is led to the upper part of the stageThe Archers draw their arrows then Alonzo rushes down covers her with his shield and exclaims  Hold monsters hold  They are astonished at the appearance of Alonzo and drop their bows Cora saints Alonzo bears her forward  Alonzo  My life my CoraCould their barbarian hands dare point their vengeance at thy lovely form And have I then the bliss to clasp thee once againTho' danger and tho' death on every side surround us still to enfold thee thus is extacy  Cora  My loved AlonzoThey told me thou wen't dead and I was eager to escape from life again to meet thee  Alonso  By miracle hath Heaven preserved me But say what meant those bloody rites  to Catalpo  Catalpo  Think not thy frenzy shall impede our justice  Orozimbo without  Make fast the Temple gatesThe foe will soon be here  comes forward  Alonzodost thou live my friend  Alonzo  The arm of heaven was surely stretched to save meI forced my way thro' the opposing multitude and seeing all was lost I came once more to view this precious treasure and die defending ithere I met death in all his direst horror cloathed in the garb of priestly cruelty not even thy commandtheir king's decree could stop the torrent of their barbarous zeal  Orozimbo  Thou traitorhence from my sight begone  Exit Catalpo  death waits us all let's meet it as we ought  Distant shouts  Alonzo  Oh what a moment of distraction must I behold thee  to  Cora sinking beneath the weight of butchering swords or worse leave thee the victim of a brutal conqueror  Cora  Can my Alonzo grudge me the bliss to die with himsouls linked like ours the call of death should never summon singlyThe horrors of captivity thou need'st not dread for me This    snatching  Alonzo's  poignard    if the sabres of the foe shrink from shedding a woman's blood this shall prevent my lingering in life when my dear lord has left it  Noise at the gate of the Temple and shouts  Alonzo

toilMy friends much have I to enquire  Alonzo  Great Columbus till my heart is made acquainted with thy fortunes I cannot tell thee of my happinessHas Spain redressed thy injuries has Ferdinand  Columbus  Alonzo my wrongs were enviable captivity was triumph When amidst the applauding shouts of thousands I approached the royal presence the suffering monarch shrunk from the fight and threw his mantle o'er his face crimsoned with shame then raised me to his arms still my pride sustained me but when I beheld the beauteous Isabella try to force from their dire grasp my galling chains and on each wound drop a balmy tear loyalty and love ruthed on my soul I embraced her royal feet and gave her tears for thanks then all the pride of pageantry was decreed but my soul languished for  the time when Orozimbo I might thus again enfold thee and restore to thee thy kingdom freed from the gripe of ruthless tyranny  Orozimbo  Greatest of men in firmest confidence of thy excelling virtues I repose my people's safety  Columbus  to Herbert  My noble Englishman receive from my hand this lovely maid and such benefits as I can bestow you may command  Talks apart with  Orozimbo Alonzo  and  Cora
