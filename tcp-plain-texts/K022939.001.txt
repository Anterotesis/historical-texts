Cic  THE WORKS OF Alexander Pope Esq  VOLUME I  CONTAINING HIS JUVENILE POEMS  LONDON Printed for H LINTOT J and R TONSON and S DRAPER MDCCLL  ADVERTISEMENT  MR POPE in his last illness amused himself amidst the care of his higher concerns in preparing a corrected and complete Edition of his Writings  "I own the late encroachments upon my constitution make me willing to see the end of all further care about me or my works I would rest for the one in a full resignation of my Being to be disposed of by the Father of all Mercy and for the other though indeed a trifle yet a trifle may be some example I would commit them to the candour of a sensible and reflecting judge rather than to the malice of every shortsighted and malevolent critic or inadvertent and censorious Reader And no hand can set them in so good a light c"  Let  cxx  to Mr W  and with his usual delicacy was even solicitous to prevent any share of the offence they might occasion from falling on the Friend whom he had engaged to give them to the Public  "I also give and bequeath to the said Mr Warburton the property of all such of my Works already printed as he hath written or shall write Commentaries or Notes upon and which I have not otherwise disposed of or alienated and as he shall publish WITHOUT FUTURE ALTERATIONS"  His last Will and Testament    In discharge of this trust the Public has here a complete Edition of his Works executed in such a manner as I am persuaded would have been to his satisfaction  The Editor hath not for the sake of profit suffered the Author's Name to be made cheap by a  Subscription  nor his Works to be defrauded of their due Honours by a vulgar or inelegant Impression nor his memory to be disgraced by any pieces unworthy of his talents or virtue On the contrary he hath at a very great expense ornamented this Edition with all the advantages which the best Artists in Paper Printing and Sculpture could bestow upon it  If the Public hath waited longer than the deference due to it should have suffered it was owing to a reason which the Editor need not make a secret It was his regard to the familyinterests of his deceased Friend Mr Pope at his death left large impressions of several parts of his Works unsold the property of which was adjudged to belong to his Executors and the Editor was willing they should have time to dispose of them to the  best advantage before the publication of this Edition which hath been long prepared should put a stop to the sale  But it may be proper to be a little more particular concerning the superiority of this Edition above all the preceding so far as Mr Pope himself was concerned What the Editor hath done the Reader must collect for himself  The FIRST Volume and the original poems in the SECOND are here printed from a copy corrected throughout by the Author himself even to the very preface Which with several additional notes in his own hand he delivered to the Editor a little before his death The Juvenile translations in the other part of the SECOND Volume it was never his intention to bring into this Edition of his Works on account of the levity of some the freedom of others and the little importance of any But these being the property of other men the Editor had it not in his power to follow the Author's intention  The THIRD Volume all but the  Essay on Man  which together with the  Essay  on Criticism  The Author a little before his death had corrected and published in Quarto as a specimen of his projected Edition was printed by him in his last illness but never published in the manner it is now given The disposition of the  Epistle on the Characters of Men  is quite altered  that  on the  Characters of Women  much enlarged and the  Epistles on Riches and Taste  corrected and improved To these advantages of the THIRD Volume must be added a great number of fine verses taken from the Author's Manuscriptcopies of these poems communicated by him for this purpose to the Editor These when he first published the poems to which they belong he thought proper for various reasons to omit Some from the Manuscriptcopy of the  Essay on Man  which tended to discredit  fate  and to recommend the  moral government  of God had by the Editor's advice been restored to their places in the last Edition of that Poem The rest together with others of the like sort from his Manuscriptcopy of the other  Ethic Epistles  are here inserted  at the bottom of the page under the title of  Variations  The FOURTH Volume contains the  Satires  with their  Prologue  the  Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot  and  Epilogue  the two poems intitled MDCCXXXVIII The  Prologue  and  Epilogue  are here given with the like advantages as the  Ethic Epistles  in the foregoing Volume that is to say with the  Variations  or additional verses from the Author's Manuscripts The  Epilogue  to the  Satires  is likewise inriched with many and large notes now first printed from the Author's own Manuscript  The FIFTH Volume contains a correcter and completer Edition of the  Dunciad  than hath been hitherto published of which at present I have only this further to add That it was at my request he laid the plan of a fourth Book I often told him It was pity so fine a poem should remain disgraced by the meanness of its subject the most  insignificant  of all Dunces bad Rymers and malevolent Cavillers That he ought to raise and enoble it by pointing his Satire against the most  pernicious  of all Minutephilosophers and  Freethinkers I imagined too it was for the interests of Religion to have it known that so great a Genius had a due abhorrence of these pests of Virtue and Society He came readily into my opinion but at the same time told me it would create him many Enemies He was not mistaken For tho' the terror of his pen kept them for some time in respect yet on his death they rose with unrestrained fury in numerous Coffeehouse tales and Grubstreet libels The plan of this admirable Satire was artfully contrived to shew that the follies and defects of a fashionable EDUCATION naturally led to and necessarily ended in FREETHINKING with design to point out the only remedy adequate to so fatal an evil It was to advance the same ends of virtue and religion that the Editor prevailed on him to alter every thing in his  moral writings  that might be suspected of having the least glance towards  Fate  or NATURALISM and to add what was proper to convince the world that he was warmly on the side of  moral Government  and a  revealed Will  And it would be injustice  to his memory not to declare that he embraced these occasions with the most unfeigned pleasure  The SIXTH Volume consists of Mr Pope's miscellaneous pieces in verse and prose Amongst the  Verse  several fine poems make now their first appearance in his Works And of the  Prose  all that is good and nothing but what is exquisitely so will be found in this Edition  The SEVENTH EIGHTH and NINTH Volumes consist entirely of his  Letters  The more valuable as they are the only true models which we or perhaps any of our neighbours have of  familiar Epistles  This collection is now made more complete by the addition of several new pieces Yet excepting a short explanatory letter to Col M and the  Letters  to Mr A and Mr W the latter of which are given to shew the Editor's inducements and the engagements he was under to intend the care of this Edition excepting these I say the rest are all here published from the Author's own printed tho' not published copies delivered to the Editor  On the whole the Advantages of this Edition above the preceding are these That it is the first complete collection which has ever been made of his original Writings That all his principal poems of early or later date are here given to the public with his last corrections and improvements That a great number of his verses are here first printed from the Manuscriptcopies of his principal poems of later date That many new notes of the Author's are here added to his Poems and lastly that several pieces both in prose and verse make now their first appearance before the Public  The Author's life deserves a just Volume and the Editor intends to give it For to have been one of the first Poets in the world is but his second praise He was in a higher Class He was one of the  noblest works of God  He was an  honest Man  " A wit's a feather and a chief's a rod  " An honest Man's the noblest work of God  A Man who alone possessed more real virtue than in very corrupt times needing a Satirist like him will sometimes fall to the share of multitudes  In this history of his life  It will be printed in the same form with this and every future edition of his works so as to make a part of them  will be contained a large account of his  writings  a critique on the nature force and extent of his  genius  exemplified from these writings and a vindication of his  moral character  exemplified by his more distinguished virtues his filial piety his disinterested friendships his reverence for the constitution of his country his love and admiration of VIRTUE and what was the necessary effect his hatred and contempt of VICE his extensive charity to the indigent his warm benevolence to mankind his supreme veneration of the Deity and above all his sincere belief of Revelation Nor shall his faults be concealed It is not for the interests of his Virtues that they should Nor indeed could they be concealed if we were so minded for they  shine  thro' his Virtues no man being more a dupe to the specious appearances of Virtue in others In a word I mean not to be his Panegyrist but his Historian And may I when Envy  and Calumny take the same advantage of my absence for while I live I will freely trust it to my  Life  to confute them may I find a Friend as careful of my honest fame as I have been of His Together with his Works he hath bequeathed me his DUNCES So that as the property is transferred I could wish they would now let his memory alone The veil which Death draws over the Good is so sacred that to throw dirt upon the Shrine scandalizes even Barbarians And though Rome permitted her Slaves to calumniate her best Citizens on the day of Triumph yet the same petulancy at their Funeral would have been rewarded with execration and a gibbet  Contents of the First Volume  PREFACE page i  Recommendatory

Not ad ℣ for  carmine  read  carmina  ℣  for  His figit  read  Hic figit  PREFACE  I Am inclined to think that both the writers of books and the readers of them are generally not a little unreasonable in their expectations The first seem to fancy that the world must approve whatever they produce and the latter to imagine that authors are obliged to please them at any rate Methinks as on the one hand no single man is born with a right of controuling the opinions of all the rest so on the other the world has no title to demand that the whole care and time of any particular person should be sacrificed to its entertainment Therefore I cannot but believe that writers and readers are under equal obligations for as much fame or pleasure as each affords the other  Every one acknowledges it would be a wild notion to expect perfection in any work of man and yet one would think the contrary was taken for granted by the judgment commonly past upon Poems A Critic supposes he has done his part if he proves a writer to have failed in an expression or erred in any particular point and can it then be wondered at if the Poets in general seem resolved not to own themselves in any error For  as long as one side will make no allowances the other will be brought to no acknowledgements  In the former editions it was thus  For as long as one side despises a well meant endeavour the other will not be satisfied with a moderate approbation  But the Author altered it as these words were rather a consequence from the conclusion he would draw than the conclusion itself which he has now inserted    I am afraid this extreme zeal on both sides is illplaced Poetry and Criticism being by no means the universal concern of the world but only the affair of idle men who write in their closets and of idle men who read there  Yet sure upon the whole a bad Author deserves better usage than a bad Critic for a Writer's endeavour for the most part is to please his Readers and he fails merely through the misfortune of an ill judgment but such a Critic's is to put them out of humor a design he could never go upon without both that and an ill temper  I think a good deal may be said to extenuate the fault of bad Poets What we call a Genius is hard to be distinguished by a man himself from a strong inclination and if his genius be ever so great he cannot at first discover it any other way than by giving way to that prevalent propensity which renders him the more liable to be mistaken The only method he has is to make the experiment by writing and appealing to the judgment of others now if he happens to write ill which is certainly no sin in itself he is immediately made  an object of ridicule I wish we had the humanity to reflect that even the worst authors might in their endeavour to please us deserve something at our hands We have no cause to quarrel with them but for their obstinacy in persisting to write and this too may admit of alleviating circumstances Their particular friends may be either ignorant or insincere and the rest of the world in general is too well bred to shock them with a truth which generally their Booksellers are the first that inform them of This happens not till they have spent too much of their time to apply to any profession which might better fit their talents and till such talents as they have are so far discredited as to be but of small service to them For what is the hardest case imaginable the reputation of a man generally depends upon the first steps he makes in the world and people will establish their opinion of us from what we do at that season when we have least judgment to direct us  On the other hand a good Poet no sooner communicates his works with the same desire of information but it is imagined he is a vain young creature given up to the ambition of fame when perhaps the poor man is all the while trembling with the fear of being ridiculous If he is made to hope he may please the world he falls under very unlucky circumstances for from the moment he prints he must expect to hear no more truth than if he were a Prince or a Beauty If  he has not very good sense and indeed there are twenty men of wit for one man of sense his living thus in a course of flattery may put him in no small danger of becoming a Coxcomb if he has he will consequently have so much diffidence as not to reap any great satisfaction from his praise since if it be given to his face it can scarce be distinguished from flattery and if in his absence it is hard to be certain of it Were he sure to be commended by the best and most knowing he is as sure of being envied by the worst and most ignorant which are the majority for it is with a fine Genius as with a fine fashion all those are displeased at it who are not able to follow it and it is to be feared that esteem will seldom do any man so much good as illwill does him harm Then there is a third class of people who make the largest part of mankind those of ordinary or indifferent capacities and these to a man will hate or suspect him a hundred honest Gentlemen will dread him as a Wit and a hundred innocent Women as a Satirist In a word whatever be his fate in Poetry it is ten to one but he must give up all the reasonable aims of life for it There are indeed some advantages accruing from a Genius to Poetry and they are all I can think of the agreeable power of selfamusement when a man is idle or alone the privilege of being admitted into the best company and the freedom of saying as many careless things as other  people without being so severely remarked upon  I believe if any one early in his life should contemplate the dangerous fate of authors he would scarce be of their number on any consideration The life of a Wit is a warfare upon earth and the present spirit of the learned world is such that to attempt to serve it any way one must have the constancy of a martyr and a resolution to suffer for its sake I could wish people would believe what I am pretty certain they will not that I have been much less concerned about Fame than I durst declare till this occasion when methinks I should find more credit than I could heretofore since my writings have had their fate already and it is too late to think of prepossessing the reader in their favour I would plead it as some merit in me that the world has never been prepared for these Trifles by Prefaces byassed by recommendations dazled with the names of great Patrons wheedled with fine reasons and pretences or troubled with excuses I confess it was want of consideration that made me an author I writ because it amused me I corrected because it was as pleasant to me to correct as to write and I published because I was told I might please such as it was a credit to please To what degree I have done this I am really ignorant I had too much fondness for my productions to judge of them at first and too much judgment to be pleased with  them at last But I have reason to think they can have no reputation which will continue long or which deserves to do so for they have always fallen short not only of what I read of others but even of my own Ideas of Poetry  If any one should imagine I am not in earnest I desire him to reflect that the Ancients to say the least of them had as much Genius as we and that to take more pains and employ more time cannot fail to produce more complete pieces They constantly apply'd themselves not only to that art but to that single branch of an art to which their talent was most powerfully bent and it was the business of their lives to correct and finish their works for posterity If we can pretend to have used the same industry let us expect the same immortality Tho' if we took the same care we should still lie under a farther misfortune they writ in languages that became universal and everlasting while ours are extremely limited both in extent and in duration A mighty foundation for our pride when the utmost we can hope is but to be read in one Island and to be thrown aside at the end of one Age  All that is left us is to recommend our productions by the imitation of the Ancients and it will be found true that in every age the highest character for sense and learning has been obtain'd by those who have been most indebted to them For to say truth whatever is very good sense must  have been common sense in all times and what we call Learning is but the knowledge of the sense of our predecessors Therefore they who say our thoughts are not our own because they resemble the Ancients may as well say our faces are not our own because they are like our Fathers And indeed it is very unreasonable that people should expect us to be Scholars and yet be angry to find us so  I fairly confess that I have serv'd myself all I could by reading that I made use of the judgment of authors dead and living that I omitted no means in my power to be inform'd of my errors both by my friends and enemies But the true reason these pieces are not more correct is owing to the consideration how short a time they and I have to live One may be ashamed to consume half one's days in bringing sense and rhyme together and what Critic can be so unreasonable as not to leave a man time enough for any more serious employment or more agreeable amusement  The only plea I shall use for the favour of the public is that I have as great a respect for it as most authors have for themselves and that I have sacrificed much of my own selflove for its sake in preventing not only many mean things from seeing the light but many which I thought tolerable I would not be like those Authors who forgive themselves some particular lines for the sake of a whole  Poem and  vice versa  a whole Poem for the sake of some particular lines I believe no one qualification is so likely to make a good writer as the power of rejecting his own thoughts and it must be this if any thing that can give me a chance to be one For what I have published I can only hope to be pardon'd but for what I have burn'd I deserve to be prais'd On this account the world is under some obligation to me and owes me the justice in return to look upon no verses as mine that are not inserted in this collection And perhaps nothing could make it worth my while to own what are really so but to avoid the imputation of so many dull and immoral things as partly by malice and partly by ignorance have been ascribed to me I must farther acquit myself of the presumption of having lent my name to recommend any Miscellanies or Works of other men a thing I never thought becoming a person who has hardly credit enough to answer for his own  In this office of collecting my pieces I am altogether uncertain whether to look upon myself as a man building a monument or burying the dead  If Time shall make it the former may these Poems as long as they last remain as a testimony that their Author never made his talents subservient to the mean and unworthy ends of Party or Selfinterest the gratification of public prejudices or private passions the flattery of the undeserving  or the insult of the unfortunate If I have written well let it be consider'd that 'tis what no man can do without good sense a quality that not only renders one capable of being a good writer but a good man And if I have made any acquisition in the opinion of any one under the notion of the former let it be continued to me under no other title than that of the latter  But if this publication be only a more solemn funeral of my Remains I desire it may be known that I die in charity and in my senses without any murmurs against the justice of this age or any mad appeals to posterity I declare I shall think the world in the right and quietly submit to every truth which time shall discover to the prejudice of these writings not so much as wishing so irrational a thing as that every body should be deceived merely for my credit However I desire it may then be considered That there are very few things in this collection which were not written under the age of five and twenty so that my youth may be made as it never fails to be in Executions a case of compassion That I was never so concerned about my works as to vindicate them in print believing if any thing was good it would defend itself and what was bad could never be defended That I used no artifice to raise or continue a reputation depreciated no dead author I was obliged to bribed no living one with unjust praise insulted no adversary with ill language or when I could  not attack a Rival's works encouraged reports against his Morals To conclude if this volume perish let it serve as a warning to the Critics not to take too much pains for the future to destroy such things as will die of themselves and a  Memento mori  to some of my vain contemporaries the Poets to teach them that when real merit is wanting it avails nothing to have been encouraged by the great commended by the eminent and favoured by the public in general  Nov  Variations in the Author's Manuscript Preface  AFTER pag  v  l    it followed thus  For my part I confess had I seen things in this view at first the public had never been troubled either with my writings or with this apology for them I am sensible how difficult it is to speak of ones self with decency but when a man must speak of himself the best way is to speak truth of himself or he may depend upon it others will do it for him I'll therefore make this Preface a general confession of all my thoughts of my own Poetry resolving with the same freedom to  expose myself as it is in the power of any other to expose them In the first place I thank God and nature that I was born with a love to poetry for nothing more conduces to fill up all the intervals of our time or if rightly used to make the whole course of life entertaining  Cantantes licet usque minus via laedet  'Tis a vast happiness to possess the pleasures of the head the only pleasures in which a man is sufficient to himself and the only part of him which to his satisfaction he can employ all day long The Muses are  amicae omnium horarum  and like our gay acquaintance the best company in the world as long as one expects no real service from them I confess there was a time when I was in love with myself and my first productions were the children of self love upon innocence I had made an Epic Poem and Panegyrics on all the Princes in Europe and thought myself the greatest genius that ever was I can't but regret those delightful visions of my childhood which like the fine colours we see when our eyes are shut are vanished for ever Many tryals and sad experience have so undeceived me by degrees that I am utterly at a loss at what rate to value myself As for fame I shall be glad of any I can get and not repine at any I miss and as for vanity I have enough to keep me from hanging myself or even from wishing those hanged who would take it away It was this that made me write The sense of my faults made me correct  besides that it was as pleasant to me to correct as to write  At p  vii  l  In the first place I own that I have used my best endeavours to the finishing these pieces That I made what advantage I could of the judgment of authors dead and living and that I omitted no means in my power to be informed of my errors by my friends and by my enemies And that I expect no favour on account of my youth business want of health or any such idle excuses But the true reason they are not yet more correct is owing to the consideration how short a time they and I have to live A man that can expect but sixty years may be ashamed to employ thirty in measuring syllables and bringing sense and rhime together We spend our youth in pursuit of riches or fame in hopes to enjoy them when we are old and when we are old we find it is too late to enjoy any thing I therefore hope the Wits will pardon me if I reserve some of my time to save my soul and that  some  wise men will be of my opinion even if I should think a part of it better spent in the enjoyments of life than in pleasing the critics  On Mr POPE and his  Poems  By His GRACE JOHN SHEFFIELD Duke of BUCKINGHAM  WITH Age decay'd with Courts and bus'ness tir'd  Caring for nothing but what Ease requir'd  Too dully serious for the Muse's sport  And from the Critics safe arriv'd in Port  I little thought of launching forth agen  Amidst advent'rous Rovers of the Pen  And after so much undeserv'd success  Thus hazarding at last to make it less  Encomiums suit not this censorious time  Itself a subject for satiric rhyme  Ignorance honour'd Wit and Worth defam'd  Folly triumphant and ev'n  Homer  blam'd  But to this Genius join'd with so much Art  Such various Learning mix'd in ev'ry part  Poets are bound a loud applause to pay  Apollo  bids it and they must obey  And yet so wonderful sublime a thing  As the great ILIAD scarce could make me sing  Except I justly could at once commend  A good Companion and as firm a Friend  One moral or a mere wellnatur'd deed  Can all desert in Sciences exceed  'Tis great delight to laugh at some mens ways  But a much greater to give Merit praise  To Mr POPE on his  Pastorals  IN these more dull as more censorious days  When few dare give and fewer merit praise  A Muse sincere that never Flatt'ry knew  Pays what to friendship and desert is due  Young yet judicious in your verse are found  Art strength'ning Nature Sense improv'd by Sound  Unlike those Wits whose numbers glide along  So smooth no thought e'er interrupts the song  Laboriously enervate they appear  And write not to the head but to the ear  Our minds unmov'd and unconcern'd they lull  And are at best most musically dull  So purling streams with even murmurs creep  And hush the heavy hearers into sleep  As smoothest speech is most deceitful found  The smoothest numbers oft are empty sound  But Wit and Judgment join at once in you  Sprightly as Youth as Age consummate too  Your strains are regularly bold and please  With unforc'd care and unaffected ease  With proper thoughts and lively images  Such as by Nature to the Ancients shown  Fancy improves and judgment makes your own  For great mens fashions to be follow'd are  Altho' disgraceful 'tis their clothes to wear  Some in a polish'd style write Pastoral  Arcadia  speaks the language of the  Mall  Like some fair Shepherdess the Sylvan Muse  Should wear those flow'rs her native fields produce  And the true measure of the shepherd's wit  Should like his garb be for the Country fit  Yet must his pure and unaffected thought  More nicely than the common swain's be wrought  So with becoming art the Players dress  In silks the shepherd and the shepherdess  Yet still unchang'd the form and mode remain  Shap'd like the homely russet of the swain  Your rural Muse appears to justify  The long lost graces of Simplicity  So rural beauties captivate our sense  With virgin charms and native excellence  Yet long her Modesty those charms conceal'd  'Till by mens Envy to the world reveal'd  For Wits industrious to their trouble seem  And needs will envy what they must esteem  Live and enjoy their spite nor mourn that fate  Which would if  Virgil  liv'd on  Virgil  wait  Whose Muse did once like thine in plains delight  Thine shall like his soon take a higher flight  So Larks which first from lowly fields arise  Mount by degrees and reach at last the skies  W WYCHERLEY  To Mr POPE on his  WindsorForest  HAIL sacred Bard a Muse unknown before  Salutes thee from the bleak  Atlantic  shore  To our dark world thy shining page is shown  And  Windsor's  gay retreat becomes our own  The Eastern pomp had just bespoke our care  And  India  pour'd her gaudy treasures here  A various spoil adorn'd our naked land  The pride of  Persia  glitter'd on our strand  And  China's  Earth was cast on common sand  Toss'd up and down the glossy fragments lay  And dress'd the rocky shelves and pav'd the painted bay  Thy treasures next arriv'd and now we boast  A nobler cargo on our barren coast  From thy luxuriant Forest we receive  More lasting glories than the East can give  Wheree'er we dip in thy delightful page  What pompous scenes our busy thoughts engage  The pompous scenes in all their pride appear  Fresh in the page as in the grove they were  Nor half so true the fair  Lodona  shows  The sylvan state that on her border grows  While she the wond'ring shepherd entertains  With a new  Windsor  in her wat'ry plains  Thy juster lays the lucid wave surpass  The living scene is in the Muse's glass  Nor sweeter notes the echoing Forests chear  When  Philomela  sits and warbles there  Than when you sing the greens and op'ning glades  And give us Harmony as well as Shades  A  Titian's  hand might draw the grove but you  Can paint the grove and add the Music too  With vast variety thy pages shine  A new creation starts in ev'ry line  How sudden trees rise to the reader's sight  And make a doubtful scene of shade and light  And give at once the day at once the night  And here again what sweet confusion reigns  In dreary deserts mix'd with painted plains  And sée the deserts cast a pleasing gloom  And shrubby heaths rejoice in purple bloom  Whilst fruitful crops rise by their barren side  And bearded groves display their annual pride  Happy the Man who strings his tuneful lyre  Where woods and brooks and breathing fields inspire  Thrice happy you and worthy best to dwell  Amidst the rural joys you sing so well  I in a cold and in a barren clime  Cold as my thought and barren as my rhyme  Here on the Western beach attempt to chime  O joyless flood O rough tempestuous main  Border'd with weeds and solitudes obscene  Snatch me ye Gods from these  Atlantic  shores  And shelter me in  Windsor's  fragrant bow'rs  Or to my muchlov'd  Isis'  walks convey  And on her flow'ry banks for ever lay  Thence let me view the venerable scene  The awful dome the groves eternal green  Where sacred  Hough  long found his fam'd retreat  And brought the Muses to the sylvan seat  Reform'd the wits unlock'd the Classic store  And made that Music which was noise before  There with illustrious Bards I spent my days  Nor free from censure nor unknown to praise  Enjoy'd the blessings that his reign bestow'd  Nor envy'd  Windsor  in the soft abode  The golden minutes smoothly danc'd away  And tuneful Bards beguil'd the tedious day  They sung nor sung in vain with numbers fir'd  That  Maro  taught or  Addison  inspir'd  Even I essay'd to touch the trembling string  Who could hear them and not attempt to sing  Rouz'd from these dreams by thy commanding strain  I rise and wander thro' the field or plain  Led by thy Muse from sport to sport I run  Mark the stretch'd Line or hear the thund'ring gun  Ah how I melt with pity when I spy  On the cold earth the flutt'ring Pheasant lie  His gaudy robes in dazling lines appear  And ev'ry feather shines and varies there  Nor can I pass the gen'rous courser by  But while the prancing steed allures my eye  He starts he's gone and now I see him fly  O'er hills and dales and now I lose the course  Nor can the rapid sight pursue the flying horse  Oh cou'd thy  Virgil  from his orb look down  He'd view a courser that might match his own  Fir'd with the sport and eager for the chace  Lodona's  murmurs stop me in the race  Who can refuse  Lodona's  melting tale  The soft complaint shall over time prevail  The Tale be told when shades forsake her shore  The Nymph be sung when she can flow no more  Nor shall thy song old  Thames  forbear to shine  At once the subject and the song divine  Peace sung by thee shall please ev'n  Britons  more  Than all their shouts for Victory before  Oh could  Britannia  imitate thy stream  The world should tremble at her awful name  From various springs divided waters glide  In diff'rent colours roll a diff'rent tyde  Murmur along their crooked banks awhile  At once they murmur and enrich the Isle  A while distinct thro' many channels run  But meet at last and sweetly flow in one  There joy to lose their longdistinguish'd names  And make one

rapture they rehearse  Then ask who wrought that miracle of verse  He answer'd with a frown "I now reveal  " A truth that Envy bids me not conceal  " Retiring frequent to this Laureat vale  " I warbled to the Lyre that fav'rite tale  " Which unobserv'd a wand'ring  Greek  and blind  " Heard me repeat and treasur'd in his mind  " And fir'd with thirst of more than mortal praise  " From me the God of Wit usurp'd the bays  " But let vain  Greece  indulge her growing fame  " Proud with celestial spoils to grace her name  " Yet when my Arts shall triumph in the West  " And the white Isle with female pow'r is blest  " Fame I foresee will make reprisals there  " And the Translator's Palm to me transfer  " With less regret my claim I now decline  " The World will think his  English Iliad  mine"  E FENTON  To Mr POPE  TO praise and still with just respect to praise  A Bard triumphant in immortal bays  The Learn'd to show the Sensible commend  Yet still preserve the province of the Friend  What life what vigour must the lines require  What Music tune them what Affection fire  O might thy Genius in my bosom shine  Thou should'st not fail of numbers worthy thine  The brightest Ancients might at once agree  To sing within my lays and sing of thee  Horace himself would own thou dost excell  In candid arts to play the Critic well  Ovid himself might wish to sing the Dame  Whom Windsor Forest sees a gliding stream  On silver feet with annual Osier crown'd  She runs for ever thro' Poetic ground  How flame the glories of Belinda's Hair  Made by thy Muse the Envy of the Fair  Less shone the tresses Aegypt's Princess wore  Which sweet Callimachus so sung before  Here courtly trifles set the world at odds  Belles war with Beaux and Whims descend for Gods  The new Machines in names of ridicule  Mock the grave phrenzy of the Chemic fool  But know ye Fair a point conceal'd with art  The Sylphs and Gnomes are but a Woman's heart  The Graces stand in sight a Satiretrain  Peeps o'er their head and laughs behind the scene  In Fame's fair Temple o'er the boldest wits  Inshrin'd on high the sacred Virgil sits  And sits in measures such as Virgil's Muse  To place thee near him might be fond to chuse  How might he tune th'alternate reed with thee  Perhaps a Strephon thou a Daphnis he  While some old Damon o'er the vulgar wife  Thinks he deserves and thou deserv'st the Prize  Rapt with the thought my fancy seeks the plains  And turns me shepherd while I hear the strains  Indulgent nurse of ev'ry tender gale  Parent of flowrets old Arcadia hail  Here in the cool my limbs at ease I spread  Here let thy poplars whisper o'er my head  Still slide thy waters soft among the trees  Thy aspins quiver in a breathing breeze  Smile all ye valleys in eternal spring  Be hush'd ye winds while Pope and Virgil sing  In English lays and all sublimely great  Thy Homer warms with all his ancient heat  He shines in Council thunders in the Fight  And flames with ev'ry sense of great delight  Long has that Poet reign'd and long unknown  Like Monarchs sparkling on a distant throne  In all the Majesty of Greek retir'd  Himself unknown his mighty name admir'd  His language failing wrapt him round with night  Thine rais'd by thee recalls the work to light  So wealthy Mines that ages long before  Fed the large realms around with golden Ore  When choak'd by sinking banks no more appear  And shepherds only say  The mines were here  Should some rich youth if nature warm his heart  And all his projects stand inform'd with art  Here clear the caves there ope the leading vein  The mines detected flame with gold again  How vast how copious are thy new designs  How ev'ry Music varies in thy lines  Still as I read I feel my bosom beat  And rise in raptures by another's heat  Thus in the wood when summer dress'd the days  While Windsor lent us tuneful hours of ease  Our ears the lark the thrush the turtle blest  And Philomela sweetest o'er the rest  The shades resound with songO softly tread  While a whole season warbles round my head  This to my Friendand when a friend inspires  My silent harp its master's hand requires  Shakes off the dust and makes these rocks resound  For fortune plac'd me in unfertile ground  Far from the joys that with my soul agree  From wit from learningvery far from thee  Here mossgrown trees expand the smallest leaf  Here half an acre's corn is half a sheaf  Here hills with naked heads the tempest meet  Rocks at their sides and torrents at their feet  Or lazy lakes unconscious of a flood  Whose dull brown Naiads ever sleep in mud  Yet here Content can dwell and learned Ease  A Friend delight me and an Author please  Ev'n here I sing when POPE supplies the theme  Shew my own love tho' not increase his fame  T PARNELL  To Mr POPE  LET vulgar souls triumphal arches raise  Or speaking marbles to record their praise  And picture to the voice of Fame unknown  The mimic Feature on the breathing stone  Mere mortals subject to death's total sway  Reptiles of earth and beings of a day  'Tis thine on ev'ry heart to grave thy praise  A monument which Worth alone can raise  Sure to survive when time shall whelm in dust  The arch the marble and the mimic bust  Nor 'till the volumes of th'expanded sky  Blaze in one flame shalt thou and Homer die  Then sink together in the world's last fires  What heav'n created and what heav'n inspires  If aught on earth when once this breath is fled  With human transport touch the mighty dead  Shakespear rejoice his hand thy page refines  Now ev'ry scene with native brightness shines  Just to thy Fame he gives thy genuine thought  So Tully publish'd what Lucretius wrote  Prun'd by his care thy laurels loftier grow  And bloom afresh on thy immortal brow  Thus when thy draughts O Raphael time invades  And the bold figure from the canvass fades  A rival hand recalls from ev'ry part  Some latent grace and equals art with art  Transported we survey the dubious strife  While each fair image starts again to life  How long untun'd had Homer's sacred lyre  Jarr'd grating discord all extinct his fire  This you beheld and taught by heav'n to sing  Call'd the loud music from the sounding string  Now wak'd from slumbers of three thousand years  Once more Achilles in dread pomp appears  Tow'rs o'er the field of death as fierce he turns  Keen flash his arms and all the Hero burns  With martial stalk and more than mortal might  He strides along and meets the Gods in fight  Then the pale Titans chain'd on burning floors  Start at the din that rends th'infernal shores  Tremble the tow'rs of Heav'n earth rocks her coasts  And gloomy Pluto shakes with all his ghosts  To ev'ry theme responds thy various lay  Here rolls a torrent there Meanders play  Sonorous as the storm thy numbers rise  Toss the wild waves and thunder in the skies  Or softer than a yielding virgin's sigh  The gentle breezes breathe away and die  Thus like the radiant God who sheds the day  You paint the vale or gild the azure way  And while with ev'ry theme the verse complies  Sink without groveling without rashness rise  Proceed great Bard awake th'harmonious string  Be ours all Homer still Ulysses sing  How long  Odyssey  lib xvi  that Hero by unskilful hands  Strip'd of his robes a Beggar trod our lands  Such as he wander'd o'er his native coast  Shrunk by the wand and all the warrior lost  O'er his smooth skin a bark of wrinkles spread  Old age disgrac'd the honours of his head  Nor longer in his heavy eyeball shin'd  The glance divine forthbeaming from the mind  But you like Pallas ev'ry limb infold  With royal robes and bid him shine in gold  Touch'd by your hand his manly frame improves  With grace divine and like a God he moves  Ev'n I the meanest of the Muses' train  Inflam'd by thee attempt a nobler strain  Advent'rous waken the Maeonian lyre  Tun'd by your hand and sing as you inspire  So arm'd by great Achilles for the fight  Patroclus conquer'd in Achilles' right  Like theirs our Friendship and I boast my name  To thine unitedfor thy Friendship's Fame  This labour past of heav'nly subjects sing  While hov'ring angels listen on the wing  To hear from earth such heartfelt raptures rise  As when they sing suspended hold the skies  Or nobly rising in fair Virtue's cause  From thy own life transcribe th'unerring laws  Teach a bad world beneath her saway to bend  To verse like thine fierce savages attend  And men more fierce when Orpheus tunes the lay  Ev'n fiends relenting hear their rage away  W BROOME  To Mr POPE On the publishing his WORKS  HE comes he comes bid ev'ry Bard prepare  The song of triumph and attend his Car  Great Sheffield's Muse the long procession heads  And throws a lustre o'er the pomp she leads  First gives the Palm she fir'd him to obtain  Crowns his gay brow and shews him how to reign  Thus young Alcides by old Chiron taught  Was form'd for all the miracles he wrought  Thus Chiron did the youth he taught applaud  Pleas'd to behold the earnest of a God  But hark what shouts what gath'ring crouds rejoice  Unstain'd their praise by any venal voice  Such as th'Ambitious vainly think their due  When Prostitutes or needy Flatt'rers sue  And see the Chief before him laurels born  Trophies from undeserving temples torn  Here Rage enchain'd reluctant raves and there  Pale Envy dumb and sick'ning with despair  Prone to the earth she bends her loathing eye  Weak to support the blaze of majesty  But what are they that turn the sacred page  Three lovely Virgins and of equal age  Intent they read and all enamour'd seem  As he that met his likeness in the stream  The GRACES these and see how they contend  Who most shall praise who best shall recommend  The Chariot now the painful steep ascends  The Paeans cease thy glorious labour ends  Here fix'd the bright eternal Temple stands  Its prospect an unbounded view commands  Say wond'rous youth whatColumn wilt thou chuse  What laurell'd Arch for thy triumphant Muse  Tho' each great Ancient court thee to his shrine  Though ev'ry Laurel thro' the dome be thine  From the proud Epic down to those that shade  The gentler brow of the soft Lesbian maid  Go to the Good and Just an awful train  Thy soul's delight and glory of the Fane  While thro' the earth thy dear remembrance flies  " Sweet to the World and grateful to the skies"  SIMON HARCOURT  To Mr POPE  From Rome    IMmortal Bard for whom each Muse has wove  The fairest garlands of th' Aonian Grove  Preserv'd our drooping Genius to restore  When Addison and Congreve are no more  After so many stars extinct in night  The darken'd Age's last remaining light  To thee from Latian realms this verse is writ  Inspir'd by memory of ancient Wit  For now no more these climes their influence boast  Fall'n is their Glory and their Virtue lost  From Tyrants and from Priests the Muses fly  Daughters of Reason and of Liberty  Nor Baiae now nor Umbria's plain they love  Nor on the banks of Nar or Mincio rove  To Thames's flow'ry borders they retire  And kindle in thy breast the Roman fire  So in the shades where chear'd with summer rays  Melodious linnets warbled sprightly lays  Soon as the faded falling leaves complain  Of gloomy winter's unauspicious reign  No tuneful voice is heard of joy or love  But mournful silence saddens all the grove  Unhappy Italy whose alter'd state  Has felt the worst severity of Fate  Not that Barbarian hands her Fasces broke  And bow'd her haughty neck beneath their yoke  Nor that her palaces to earth are thrown  Her cities desart and her fields unsown  But that her ancient Spirit is decay'd  That sacred Wisdom from her bounds is fled  That there the source of Science flows no more  Whence its rich streams supply'd the world before  Illustrious Names that once in Latium shin'd  Born to instruct and to command Mankind  Chiefs by whose Virtue mighty Rome was rais'd  And Poets who those chiefs sublimely prais'd  Oft I the traces you have left explore  Your ashes visit and your urns adore  Oft kiss with lips devout some mould'ring stone  With ivy's venerable shade o'ergrown  Those hallow'd ruins better pleas'd to see  Than all the pomp of modern Luxury  As late on Virgil's tomb fresh flow'rs I strow'd  While with th'inspiring Muse my bosom glow'd  Crown'd with eternal bays my ravish'd eyes  Beheld the Poet's awful Form arise  Stranger he said whose pious hand has paid  These grateful rites to my attentive shade  When thou shalt breathe thy happy native air  To Pope this message from his Master bear  Great Bard whose numbers I myself inspire  To whom I gave my own harmonious lyre  If high exalted on the Throne of Wit  Near Me and Homer thou aspire to sit  No more let meaner Satire dim the rays  That flow majestic from thy nobler Bays  In all the flow'ry paths of Pindus stray  But shun that thorny that unpleasing way  Nor when each soft engaging Muse is thine  Address the least attractive of the Nine  Of thee more worthy were the task to raise  A lasting Column to thy Country's Praise  To sing the Land which yet alone can boast  That Liberty corrupted Rome has lost  Where Science in the arms of Peace is laid  And plants her Palm beneath the Olive's shade  Such was the Theme for which my lyre I strung  Such was the People whose exploits I sung  Brave yet refin'd for Arms and Arts renown'd  With diff'rent bays by Mars and Phoebus crown'd  Dauntless opposers of Tyrannic Sway  But pleas'd a mild AUGUSTUS to obey  If these commands submissive thou receive  Immortal and unblam'd thy name shall live  Envy to black Cocytus shall retire  And howl with Furies in tormenting fire  Approving Time shall consecrate thy Lays  And join the Patriot's to the Poet's Praise  GEORGE LYTTELTON  PASTORALS  WITH A Discourse on PASTORAL  Written in the Year MDCCIV  Rura mihi et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes  Flumina amem sylvasque inglorius  VIRG  A DISCOURSE ON PASTORAL POETRY  Written at sixteen years of age  P    THERE are not I believe a greater number of any sort of verses than of those which are called Pastorals nor a smaller than of those which are truly so It therefore seems necessary to give some account of this kind of Poem and it is my design to comprize in this short paper the substance of those numerous dissertations the Critics have made on the subject without omitting any of their rules in my own favour You will also find some points reconciled about which they seem to differ and a few remarks which I think have escaped their observation  The original of Poetry is ascribed to that Age which succeeded the creation of the world and as the keeping of flocks seems to have been the first employment of mankind the most ancient sort of poetry was probably  pastoral  Fontenelle's Disc on Pastorals  P  It is natural to  imagine that the leisure of those ancient shepherds admitting and inviting some diversion none was so proper to that solitary and sedentary life as singing and that in their songs they took occasion to celebrate their own felicity From hence a Poem was invented and afterwards improved to a perfect image of that happy time which by giving us an esteem for the virtues of a former age might recommend them to the present And since the life of shepherds was attended with more tranquillity than any other rural employment the Poets chose to introduce their Persons from whom it received the name of Pastoral  A Pastoral is an imitation of the action of a shepherd or one considered under that character The form of this imitation is dramatic or narrative or mixed of both  Heinsius in Theocr  P  the fable simple the manners not too polite nor too rustic the thoughts are plain yet admit a little quickness and passion but that short and flowing the expression humble yet as pure as the language will afford neat but not florid easy and yet lively In short the fable manners thoughts and expressions are full of the greatest simplicity in nature  The complete character of this poem consists in simplicity  Rapin de Carm Past p  P  brevity and delicacy the two first of which render an eclogue natural and the last delightful  If we would copy Nature it may be useful to take this Idea along with us that Pastoral is an image of what they call the golden age So that we are not to describe our shepherds as shepherds at this day really are but as they may be conceived then to have been when the best of men followed the employment To carry this resemblance yet farther it would not be amiss to give these shepherds some skill in astronomy as far as it may be useful to that sort of life And an air of piety to the Gods should shine through the Poem which so visibly appears in all the works of antiquity and it ought to preserve some relish of the old way of writing the connection should be loose the narrations and descriptions short  Rapin Reflex sur l'Art Poet d'Arist p Refl xxvii  P  and the periods concise Yet it is not sufficient that the sentences only be brief the whole Eclogue should be so too For we cannot suppose Poetry in those days to have been the business of men but their recreation at vacant hours  But with a respect to the present age nothing more conduces to make these composures natural than when some Knowledge in rural affairs is discovered  Pref to Virg Past in Dryd Virg  P  This may be made to appear rather done by chance than on design and sometimes is best shewn by inference lest by too much study to seem natural we destroy that easy simplicity from whence arises the delight For what is inviting  in this sort of poetry proceeds not so much from the Idea of that business as of the tranquillity of a country life  We must therefore use some illusion to render a Pastoral delightful and this consists in exposing the best side only of a shepherd's life and in concealing its miseries  Fontenelle's Disc of Pastorals  P  Nor is it enough to introduce shepherds discoursing together in a natural way but a regard must be had to the subject that it contain some particular beauty in itself and that it be different in every Eclogue Besides in each of them a designed scene or prospect is to be presented to our view which should likewise have its variety  See the forementioned Preface  P  This variety is obtained in a great degree by frequent comparisons drawn from the most agreeable objects of the country by interrogations to things inanimate by beautiful digressions but those short sometimes by insisting a little on circumstances and lastly by elegant turns on the words which render the numbers extremely sweet and pleasing As for the numbers themselves though they are properly of the heroic measure they should be the smoothest the most easy and flowing imaginable  It is by rules like these that we ought to judge of Pastoral And since the instructions given for any art are to be delivered as that art is in perfection they must of necessity be derived from those  in whom it is acknowledged so to be It is therefore from the practice of Theocritus and Virgil the only undisputed authors of Pastoral that the Critics have drawn the foregoing notions concerning it  Theocritus excels all others in nature and simplicity The subjects of his Idyllia are purely pastoral but he is not so exact in his persons having introduced reapers  ΘΕΡΙΣΤΑΙ  Idyl  x and ΑΛΙΕΙΣ Idyl xxi  P  and fishermen as well as shepherds He is apt to be too long in his descriptions of which that of the Cup in the first pastoral is a remarkable instance In the manners he seems a little defective for his swains are sometimes abusive and immodest and perhaps too much inclining to rusticity for instance in his fourth and fifth Idyllia But 'tis enough that all others learnt their excellencies from him and that his Dialect alone has a secret charm in it which no other could ever attain  Virgil who copies Theocritus refines upon his original and in all points where judgment is principally concerned he is much superior to his master Though some of his subjects are not pastoral in themselves but only seem to be such they have a wonderful variety in them which the Greek was a stranger to  Rapin Refl on Arist part ii refl xxviiPref to the Ecl in Dryden's Virg  P  He exceeds him in regularity and brevity and falls short of him in  nothing but simplicity and propriety of style the first of which perhaps was the fault of his age and the last of his language  Among the moderns their success has been greatest who have most endeavoured to make these ancients their pattern The most considerable Genius appears in the famous Tasso and our Spenser Tasso in his Aminta has as far excelled all the Pastoral writers as in his Gierusalemme he has outdone the Epic poets of his country But as this piece seems to have been the original of a new sort of poem the Pastoral Comedy in Italy it cannot so well be considered as a copy of the ancients Spenser's Calendar in Mr Dryden's opinion is the most complete work of this kind which any nation has produced ever since the time of Virgil  Dedication to Virg Ecl  P  Not but that he may be thought imperfect in some few points His Eclogues are somewhat too long if we compare them with the ancients He is sometimes too allegorical and treats of matters of religion in a pastoral style as Mantuan had done before him He has employed the Lyric measure which is contrary to the practice of the old Poets His Stanza is not still the same nor always well chosen This last may be the reason his expression is sometimes not concise enough for the Tetrastic has obliged him to extend his sense to the length of four lines which  would have been more closely confined in the Couplet  In the manners thoughts and characters he comes near to Theocritus himself tho' notwithstanding all the care he has taken he is certainly inferior in his Dialect For the Doric had its beauty and propriety in the Time of Theocritus it was used in part of Greece and frequent in the mouths of many of the greatest persons whereas the old English and country phrases of Spenser were either entirely obsolete or spoken only by people of the lowest condition As there is a difference betwixt simplicity and rusticity so the expression of simple thoughts should be plain but not clownish The addition he has made of a Calendar to his Eclogues is very beautiful since by this besides the general moral of innocence and simplicity which is common to other authors of Pastoral he has one peculiar to himself he compares human Life to the several Seasons and at once exposes to his readers a view of the great and little worlds in their various changes and aspects Yet the scrupulous division of his Pastorals into Months has obliged him either to repeat the same description in other words for three months together or when it was exhausted before entirely to omit it whence it comes to pass that some of his Eclogues as the sixth eighth and tenth for example have nothing but their Titles to distinguish them The reason is evident because the year has not that variety  in it to furnish every month with a particular description as it may every season  Of the following Eclogues I shall only say that these four comprehend all the subjects which the Critics upon Theocritus and Virgil will allow to be fit for pastoral That they have as much variety of description in respect of the several seasons as Spenser's that in order to add to this variety the several times of the day are observ'd the rural employments in each season or time of day and the rural scenes or places proper to such employments not without some regard to the several ages of man and the different passions proper to each age  But after all if they have any merit it is to be attributed to some good old Authors whose works as I had leisure to study so I hope I have not wanted care to imitate  SPRING  THE FIRST PASTORAL OR DAMON  To Sir WILLIAM TRUMBAL  FIRST in these fields I try the sylvan strains  Nor blush to sport on Windsor's blissful plains  Fair Thames flow gently from thy sacred spring  While on thy banks Sicilian Muses sing  Let vernal airs thro' trembling osiers play  And Albion's cliffs resound the rural lay  You that too wise for pride too good for pow'r  Enjoy the glory to be great no more  And carrying with you all the world can boast  To all the world illustriously are lost  O let my Muse her slender reed inspire  Till in your native shades you tune the lyre  So when the Nightingale to rest removes  The Thrush may chant to the forsaken groves  But charm'd to silence listens while she sings  And all th' aërial audience clap their wings  Soon as the flocks shook off the nightly dews  Two Swains whom Love kept wakeful and the Muse  Pour'd o'er the whitening vale their fleecy care  Fresh as the morn and as the season fair  The dawn now blushing on the mountain's side  Thus Daphnis spoke and Strephon thus reply'd  DAPHNIS  Hear how the birds on ev'ry bloomy spray  With joyous musick wake the dawning day  Why sit we mute when early linnets sing  When warbling Philomel salutes the spring  Why sit we sad when Phosphor shines so clear  And lavish Nature paints the purple year  STREPHON  Sing then and Damon shall attend the strain  While yon' slow oxen turn the furrow'd plain  Here the bright crocus and blue vi'let glow  Here western winds on breathing roses blow  I'll stake yon' lamb that near the fountain plays  And from the brink his dancing shade surveys  DAPHNIS  And I this bowl where wanton ivy twines  And swelling clusters bend the curling vines  Four figures rising from the work appear  The various seasons of the rowling year  And what is that which binds the radiant sky  Where twelve fair signs in beauteous order lie  DAMON  Then sing by turns by turns the Muses sing  Now hawthorns blossom now the daisies spring  Now leaves the trees and flow'rs adorn the ground  Begin the vales shall ev'ry note rebound  STREPHON  Inspire me Phoebus in my Delia's praise  With Waller's strains or Granville's moving lays  A milkwhite bull shall at your altars stand  That threats a fight and spurns the rising sand  DAPHNIS  O Love for Sylvia let me gain the prize  And make my tongue victorious as her eyes  No lambs or sheep for victims I'll impart  Thy victim Love shall be the shepherd's heart  STREPHON  Me gentle Delia beckons from the plain  Then hid in shades eludes her eager swain  But feigns a laugh to see me search around  And by that laugh the willing fair is found  DAPHNIS  The sprightly Sylvia trips along the green  She runs but hopes she does not run unseen  While a kind glance at her pursuer flies  How much at variance are her feet and eyes  STREPHON  O'er golden sands let rich Pactolus flow  And trees weep amber on the banks of Po  Blest Thames's shores the brightest beauties yield  Feed here my lambs I'll seek no distant field  DAPHNIS  Celestial Venus haunts Idalia's groves  Diana Cynthus Ceres Hybla loves  If Windsorshades delight the matchless maid  Cynthus and Hybla yield to Windsorshade  STREPHON  All nature mourns the skies relent in show'rs  Hush'd are the birds and clos'd the drooping flow'rs  If Delia smile the flow'rs begin to spring  The skies to brighten and the birds to sing  DAPHNIS  All nature laughs the groves are fresh and fair  The Sun's mild lustre warms the vital air  If Sylvia smiles new glories gild the shore  And vanquish'd nature seems to charm no more  STREPHON  In spring the fields in autumn hills I love  At morn the plains at noon the shady grove  But Delia always absent from her sight  Nor plains at morn nor groves at noon delight  DAPHNIS  Sylvia's like autumn ripe yet mild as May  More bright than noon yet fresh as early day  Ev'n spring displeases when she shines not here  But blest with her 'tis spring throughout the year  STREPHON  Say Daphnis say in what glad soil appears  A wond'rous Tree that sacred Monarchs bears  Tell me but this and I'll disclaim the prize  And give the conquest to thy Sylvia's eyes  DAPHNIS  Nay tell me first in what more happy fields  The Thistle springs to which the Lilly yields  And then a nobler prize I will resign  For Sylvia charming Sylvia shall be thine  DAMON  Cease to contend for Daphnis I decree  The bowl to Strephon and the lamb to thee  Blest Swains whose Nymphs in ev'ry grace excel  Blest Nymphs whose Swains those graces sing so well  Now rise and haste to yonder woodbine bow'rs  A soft retreat from sudden vernal show'rs  The turf with rural dainties shall be crown'd  While op'ning blooms diffuse their sweets around  For see the gath'ring flocks to shelter tend  And from the Pleiads fruitful show'rs descend  REMARKS  These Pastorals were written at the age of sixteen and then past thro' the hands of Mr  Walsh  Mr  Wycherley G Granville  afterwards Lord  Lansdown  Sir  William Trumbal  Dr  Garth  Lord  Hallifax  Lord  Somers  Mr  Mainwaring  and others All these gave our Author the greatest encouragement and particularly Mr  Walsh  whom Mr Dryden in his Postscript to Virgil calls the best critic of his age  "The Author says he seems to have a particular genius for this kind of Poetry and a judgment that much exceeds his years He has taken very  very freely from the Ancients But what he has mixed of his own with theirs is no way inferior to what he has taken from them It is not flattery at all to say that Virgil had written nothing so good at his Age His Preface is very judicious and learned"  Letter to Mr Wycherley Ap  The Lord Lansdown about the same time mentioning the youth of our Poet says in a printed Letter of the Character of Mr Wycherley  "that if he goes on as he has begun in the Pastoral way as Virgil first tried his strength we may hope to see English Poety vie with the Roman"  etc Notwithstanding the early time of their production the Author esteemed these as the most correct in the versification and musical in the numbers of all his works The reason for his labouring them into so much softness was doubtless that this sort of poetry derives almost its whole beauty from a natural ease of thought and smoothness of verse whereas that of most other kinds consists in the strength and fulness of both In a letter of his to Mr  Walsh  about this time we find an enumeration of several Niceties in Versification which perhaps have never been strictly observed in any  English  poem except in these Pastorals They were not printed till  P  Sir  William Trumball  Our Author's friendship with this gentleman commenced at very unequal years he

Where dancing sunbeams on the waters play'd  And verdant alders form'd a quiv'ring shade  Soft as he mourn'd the streams forgot to flow  The flocks around a dumb compassion show  The Naiads wept in ev'ry wat'ry bow'r  And Jove consented in a silent show'r  Accept O GARTH the Muse's early lays  That adds this wreath of Ivy to thy Bays  Hear what from Love unpractis'd hearts endure  From Love the sole disease thou canst not cure  Ye shady beeches and ye cooling streams  Defence from Phoebus' not from Cupid's beams  To you I mourn nor to the deaf I sing  The woods shall answer and their echo ring  The hills and rocks attend my doleful lay  Why art thou prouder and more hard than they  The bleating sheep with my complaints agree  They parch'd with heat and I inflam'd by thee  The sultry Sirius burns the thirsty plains  While in thy heart eternal winter reigns  Where stray ye Muses in what lawn or grove  While your Alexis pines in hopeless love  In those fair fields where sacred Isis glides  Or else where Cam his winding vales divides  As in the crystal spring I view my face  Fresh rising blushes paint the wat'ry glass  But since those graces please thy eyes no more  I shun the fountains which I sought before  Once I was skill'd in ev'ry herb that grew  And ev'ry plant that drinks the morning dew  Ah wretched shepherd what avails thy art  To cure thy lambs but not to heal thy heart  Let other swains attend the rural care  Feed fairer flocks or richer fleeces sheer  But nigh yon' mountain let me tune my lays  Embrace my Love and bind my brows with bays  That flute is mine which Colin's tuneful breath  Inspir'd when living and bequeath'd in death  He said Alexis take this pipe the same  That taught the groves my Rosalinda's name  But now the reeds shall hang on yonder tree  For ever silent since despis'd by thee  Oh were I made by some transforming pow'r  The captive bird that sings within thy bow'r  Then might my voice thy list'ning ears employ  And I those kisses he receives enjoy  And yet my numbers please the rural throng  Rough Satyrs dance and Pan applauds the song  The Nymphs forsaking ev'ry cave and spring  Their early fruit and milkwhite turtles bring  Each am'rous nymph prefers her gifts in vain  On you their gifts are all bestow'd again  For you the swains the fairest flow'rs design  And in one garland all their beauties join  Accept the wreath which you deserve alone  In whom all beauties are compriz'd in one  See what delights in sylvan scenes appear  Descending Gods have found Elysium here  In woods bright Venus with Adonis stray'd  And chaste Diana haunts the forestshade  Come lovely nymph and bless the silent hours  When swains from sheering seek their nightly bow'rs  When weary reapers quit the sultry field  And crown'd with corn their thanks to Ceres yield  This harmless grove no lurking viper hides  But in my breast the serpent Love abides  Here bees from blossoms sip the rosy dew  But your Alexis knows no sweets but you  Oh deign to visit our forsaken seats  The mossy fountains and the green retreats  Where'er you walk cool gales shall fan the glade  Trees where you sit shall croud into a shade  Where'er you tread the blushing flow'rs shall rise  And all things flourish where you turn your eyes  Oh how I long with you to pass my days  Invoke the Muses and resound your praise  Your praise the birds shall chant in ev'ry grove  And winds shall waft it to the pow'rs above  But would you sing and rival Orpheus' strain  The wond'ring forests soon should dance again  The moving mountains hear the pow'rful call  And headlong streams hang list'ning in their fall  But see the shepherds shun the noonday heat  The lowing herds to murm'ring brooks retreat  To closer shades the panting flocks remove  Ye Gods and is there no relief for Love  But soon the sun with milder rays descends  To the cool ocean where his journey ends  On me love's fiercer flames for ever prey  By night he scorches as he burns by day  VARIATIONS  VER were thus printed in the first edition  A faithful swain whom Love had taught to sing  Bewail'd his fate beside a silver spring  Where gentle Thames his winding waters leads

their rural lays  This mourn'd a faithless that an absent Love  And Delia's name and Doris fill'd the Grove  Ye Mantuan nymphs your sacred succour bring  Hylas and Aegon's rural lays I sing  Thou whom the Nine with Plautus' wit inspire  The art of Terence and Menander's fire  Whose sense instructs us and whose humour charms  Whose judgment sways us and whose spirit warms  Oh skill'd in Nature see the hearts of Swains  Their artless passions and their tender pains  Now setting Phoebus shone serenely bright  And fleecy clouds were streak'd with purple light  When tuneful Hylas with melodious moan  Taught rocks to weep and made the mountains groan  Go gentle gales and bear my sighs away  To Delia's ear the tender notes convey  As some sad Turtle his lost love deplores  And with deep murmurs fills the sounding shores  Thus far from Delia to the winds I mourn  A like unheard unpity'd and forlorn  Go gentle gales and bear my sighs along  For her the feather'd quires neglect their song  For her the lymes their pleasing shades deny  For her the lillies hang their heads and die  Ye flow'rs that droop forsaken by the spring  Ye birds that left by summer cease to sing  Ye trees that fade when autumnheats remove  Say is not absence death to those who love  Go gentle gales and bear my sighs away  Curs'd be the fields that cause my Delia's stay  Fade ev'ry blossom wither ev'ry tree  Die ev'ry flow'r and perish all but she  What have I said where'er my Delia flies  Let spring attend and sudden flow'rs arise  Let op'ning roses knotted oaks adorn  And liquid amber drop from ev'ry thorn  Go gentle gales and bear my sighs along  The birds shall cease to tune their ev'ning song  The winds to breathe the waving woods to move  And streams to murmur e'er I cease to love  Not bubling fountains to the thirsty swain  Not balmy sleep to lab'rers faint with pain  Not show'rs to larks or sunshine to the bee  Are half so charming as thy sight to me  Go gentle gales and bear my sighs away  Come Delia come ah why this long delay  Thro' rocks and caves the name of Delia sounds  Delia each cave and echoing rock rebounds  Ye pow'rs what pleasing frenzy sooths my mind  Do lovers dream or is my Delia kind  She comes my Delia comesNow cease my lay  And cease ye gales to bear my sighs away  Next Aegon sung while Windsor groves admir'd  Rehearse ye Muses what yourselves inspir'd  Resound ye hills resound my mournful strain  Of perjur'd Doris dying I complain  Here where the mountains less'ning as they rise  Lose the low vales and steal into the skies  While lab'ring oxen spent with toil and heat  In their loose traces from the field retreat  While curling smoaks from villagetops are seen  And the fleet shades glide o'er the dusky green  Resound ye hills resound my mournful lay  Beneath yon' poplar oft we past the day  Oft' on the rind I carv'd her am'rous vows  While she with garlands hung the bending boughs  The garlands fade the vows are worn away  So dies her love and so my hopes decay  Resound ye hills resound my mournful strain  Now bright Arcturus glads the teeming grain  Now golden fruits on loaded branches shine  And grateful clusters swell with floods of wine  Now blushing berries paint the yellow grove  Just Gods shall all things yield returns but love  Resound ye hills resound my mournful lay  The shepherds cry " Thy flocks are left a prey  Ah what avails it me the flocks to keep  Who lost my heart while I preserv'd my sheep  Pan came and ask'd what magic caus'd my smart  Or what ill eyes malignant glances dart  What eyes but hers alas have pow'r to move  And is there magic but what dwells in love  Resound ye hills resound my mournful strains  I'll fly from shepherds flocks and flow'ry plains  From shepherds flocks and plains I may remove  Forsake mankind and all the worldbut love  I know thee Love on foreign Mountains bred  Wolves gave thee suck and savage Tygers fed  Thou wert from Aetna's burning entrails torn  Got by fierce whirlwinds and in thunder born  Resound ye hills resound my mournful lay  Farewell ye woods adieu the light of day  One leap from yonder cliff shall end my pains  No more ye hills no more resound my strains  Thus sung the shepherds till th'approach of night  The skies yet blushing with departing light  When falling dews with spangles deck'd the glade  And the low sun had lengthen'd ev'ry shade

Mr Congreve tho' with a little more correctness  P  VER  The Art of Terence and Menander's fire    This line evidently alludes to that famous Character given of Terence by Caesar  Tu quoque tu in summis ô dimidiate  Menander  Poneris et merito puri sermonis amator  Lenibus atque utinam scriptis adjuncta foret  vis  Comica  So that the judicious critic sees he should have said  with Menander's fire  For what the Poet meant in this line was that his Friend had joined to Terence's art what Caesar thought wanting in Terence namely the  vis comica  of Menander Besides  and Menander's fire  is making that the Characteristic of Menander which was not His character was the having art and  comic spirit  in perfect conjunction of which Terence having only the first he is called the  half of Menander  VER  Whose sense instructs us    He was always very carefull in his encomiums not to fall into ridicule the trap which weak and prostitute flatterers rarely escape For  sense  he would willingly have said  moral  propriety required it But this dramatic poet's moral was remarkably faulty His plays are all monstrously immoral both in the Dialogue and Action  VER  And grateful clusters

 Nor rivers winding thro' the vales below  So sweetly warble or so smoothly flow  Now sleeping flocks on their soft fleeces lie  The moon serene in glory mounts the sky  While silent birds forget their tuneful lays  Oh sing of Daphne's fate and Daphne's praise  THYRSIS  Behold the groves that shine with silver frost  Their beauty wither'd and their verdure lost  Here shall I try the sweet Alexis strain  That call'd the list'ning Dryads to the plain  Thames heard the numbers as he flow'd along  And bade his willows learn the moving song  LYCIDAS  So may kind rains their vital moisture yield  And swell the future harvest of the field  Begin this charge the dying Daphne gave  And said "Ye shepherds sing around my grave"  Sing while beside the shaded tomb I mourn  And with fresh bays her rural shrine adorn  THYRSIS  Ye gentle Muses leave your crystal spring  Let Nymphs and Sylvans cypress garlands bring  Ye weeping Loves the stream with myrtles hide  And break your bows as when Adonis dy'd  And with your golden darts now useless grown  Inscribe a verse on this relenting stone  " Let nature change let heav'n and earth deplore  " Fair Daphne's dead and love is now no more  'Tis done and nature's various charms decay  See gloomy clouds obscure the chearful day  Now hung with pearls the dropping trees appear  Their faded honours scatter'd on her bier  See where on earth the flow'ry glories lie  With her they flourish'd and with her they die  Ah what avail the beauties nature wore  Fair Daphne's dead and beauty is no more  For her the flocks refuse their verdant food  The thirsty heifers shun the gliding flood  The silver swans her hapless fate bemoan  In notes more sad than when they sing their own  In hollow caves sweet Echo silent lies  Silent or only to her name replies  Her name with pleasure once she taught the shore  Now Daphne's dead and pleasure is no more  No grateful dews descend from ev'ning skies  Nor morning odours from the flow'rs arise  No rich perfumes refresh the fruitful field  Nor fragrant herbs their native incense yield  The balmy Zephyrs silent since her death  Lament the ceasing of a sweeter breath  Th' industrious bees neglect their golden store  Fair Daphne's dead and sweetness is no more  No more the mounting larks while Daphne sings  Shall list'ning in mid air suspend their wings  No more the birds shall imitate her lays  Or hush'd with wonder hearken from the sprays  No more the streams their murmurs shall forbear  A sweeter music than their own to hear  But tell the reeds and tell the vocal shore  Fair Daphne's dead and music is no more  Her fate is whisper'd by the gentle breeze  And told in sighs to all the trembling trees  The trembling trees in ev'ry plain and wood  Her fate remurmur to the silver flood  The silver flood so lately calm appears  Swell'd with new passion and o'erflows with tears  The winds and trees and floods her death deplore  Daphne our grief our glory now no more  But see where Daphne wond'ring mounts on high  Above the clouds above the starry sky  Eternal beauties grace the shining scene  Fields ever fresh and groves for ever green  There while you rest in Amaranthine bow'rs  Or from those meads select unfading flow'rs  Behold us kindly who your name implore  Daphne our Goddess and our grief no more  LYCIDAS  How all things listen while thy Muse complains  Such silence waits on Philomela's strains  In some still ev'ning when the whisp'ring breeze  Pants on the leaves and dies upon the trees  To thee bright goddess oft a lamb shall bleed  If teeming ewes encrease my fleecy breed  While plants their shade or flow'rs their odours give  Thy name thy honour and thy praise shall live  THYRSIS  But see Orion sheds unwholsome dews  Arise the pines a noxious shade diffuse  Sharp Boreas blows and Nature feels decay  Time conquers all and we must Time obey  Adieu ye vales ye mountains streams and groves  Adieu ye shepherd's rural lays and loves  Adieu my flocks farewell ye sylvan crew  Daphne farewell and all the world adieu  REMARKS  WINTER  This was the Poet's favourite Pastoral  Mrs Tempest    This Lady was of an ancient family in Yorkshire and particularly admired by the Author's friend Mr Walsh who having celebrated her in a Pastoral Elegy desired  his friend to do the same as appears from one of his Letters dated Sept  "Your last Eclogue being on the same subject with mine on Mrs Tempest's death I should take it very kindly in you to give it a little turn as if it were to the memory of the same lady"  Her death having happened on the night of the great storm in gave a propriety to this eclogue which in its general turn alludes to it The scene of the Pastoral lies in a grove the time at midnight  P  VER  shine with silver frost    The image is

Prophet Isaiah which foretell the coming of Christ and the felicities attending it I could not but observe a remarkable parity between many of the thoughts and those in the Pollio of Virgil This will not seem surprising when we reflect that the Eclogue was taken from a Sibylline prophecy on the same subject One may judge that Virgil did not copy it line by line but selected such ideas as best agreed with the nature of pastoral poetry and disposed them in that manner which served most to beautify his piece I have endeavoured the same in this imitation of him though without admitting any thing of my own since it was written with this particular view that the reader by comparing the several thoughts might see how far the images and descriptions of the Prophet are superior to those of the Poet But as I fear I have prejudiced them by my management I shall subjoin the passages of Isaiah and those of Virgil under the same disadvantage of a literal translation  P  MESSIAH  A SACRED

ye heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteousness let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation and let righteousness spring up together  This is a very noble description of divine grace shed abroad in the hearts of the faithful under the Gospel dispensation And the poet understood all its force as appears from the two lines preceding these  Th' Aethereal Spirit etc  The prophet describes this under the image of  rain  which chiefly fits the  first age  of the Gospel The poet under the idea of  dew  which extends it to  every age  And it was his purpose it should be so understood as appears from his expression of  soft silence  which agrees with the  common  not the  extraordinary  effusions of the Holy Spirit The term of  dewy nectar  for divine grace is wonderfully happy For he who would moralize the ancient Mythology in the manner of  Bacon  must say that by the poetical  nectar  can be meant only theological  grace  VER  ancient fraud    i e the fraud of the Serpent  VER  He from thick films shall purge the visual ray    The fense and language shew that by  visual ray  the poet meant the  sight  or as Milton calls it  the visual nerve  And no critic would quarrel with the figure which calls the  instrument  of vision by the name of the  cause  But tho' this term be just nay noble and even sublime yet the expression of  thick films  is faulty and he fell into it by a common neglect of the following rule of good writing  "That  when a figurative term is used whatsoever is predicated of it ought not only to agree to the thing to which the figure is applied but likewise to that from which the figure is taken"  Thick films  agree only with the thing to which it is applied namely to the  sight  or eye and not to that from which it is taken namely a  ray of light  coming to the eye He should have said  thick clouds  which would have agreed with both But these inaccuracies are not to be found in his later poems  WINDSORFOREST  To

Lord LANSDOWN  THY forests Windsor and thy green retreats  At once the Monarch's and the Muse's seats  Invite my lays Be present sylvan maids  Unlock your springs and open all your shades  GRANVILLE commands your aid O Muses bring  What Muse for GRANVILLE can refuse to sing  The Groves of Eden vanish'd now so long  Live in description and look green in song  These were my breast inspir'd with equal flame  Like them in beauty should be like in fame  Here hills and vales the woodland and the plain  Here earth and water seem to strive again  Not Chaoslike together crush'd and bruis'd  But as the world harmoniously confus'd  Where order in variety we see  And where tho' all things differ all agree  Here waving groves a chequer'd scene display  And part admit and part exclude the day  As some coy nymph her lover's warm address  Nor quite indulges nor can quite repress  There interspers'd in lawns and op'ning glades  Thin trees arise that shun each other's shades  Here in full light the russet plains extend  There wrapt in clouds the blueish hills ascend  Ev'n the wild heath displays her purple dyes  And 'midst the desart fruitful fields arise  That crown'd with tufted trees and springing corn  Like verdant isles the sable waste adorn  Let India boast her plants nor envy we  The weeping amber or the balmy tree  While by our oaks the precious loads are born  And realms commanded which those trees adorn  Not proud Olympus yields a nobler sight  Tho' Gods assembled grace his tow'ring height  Than what more humble mountains offer here  Where in their blessings all those Gods appear  See Pan with flocks with fruits Pomona crown'd  Here blushing Flora paints th'enamel'd ground  Here Ceres' gifts in waving prospect stand  And nodding tempt the joyful reaper's hand  Rich Industry sits smiling on the plains  And peace and plenty tell a STUART reigns  Not thus the land appear'd in ages past  A dreary desart and a gloomy waste  To savage beasts and savage laws a prey  And kings more furious and severe than they  Who claim'd the skies dispeopled air and floods  The lonely lords of empty wilds and woods  Cities laid waste they storm'd the dens and caves  For wiser brutes were backward to be slaves  What could be free when lawless beasts obey'd  And ev'n the elements a Tyrant sway'd  In vain kind seasons swell'd the teeming grain  Soft show'rs distill'd and suns grew warm in vain  The swain with tears his frustrate labour yields  And famish'd dies amidst his ripen'd fields  What wonder then a beast or subject slain  Were equal crimes in a despotic reign  Both doom'd alike for sportive Tyrants bled  But while the subject starv'd the beast was fed  Proud Nimrod first the bloody chace began  A mighty hunter and his prey was man  Our haughty Norman boasts that barb'rous name  And makes his trembling slaves the royal game  The fields are ravish'd from th'industrious swains  From men their cities and from Gods their fanes  The levell'd towns with weeds lie cover'd o'er  The hollow winds thro' naked temples roar  Round broken columns clasping ivy twin'd  O'er heaps of ruin stalk'd the stately hind  The fox obscene to gaping tombs retires  And savage howlings fill the sacred quires  Aw'd by his Nobles by his Commons curst  Th'Oppressor rul'd tyrannic where he durst  Stretch'd o'er the Poor and Church his iron rod  And serv'd alike his Vassals and his God  Whom ev'n the Saxon spar'd and bloody Dane  The wanton victims of his sport remain  But see the man who spacious regions gave  A waste for beasts himself deny'd a grave  Stretch'd on the lawn his second hope survey  At once the chaser and at once the prey  Lo Rufus tugging at the deadly dart  Bleeds in the forest like a wounded hart  Succeeding monarchs heard the subjects cries  Nor saw displeas'd the peaceful cottage rise  Then gath'ring flocks on unknown mountains fed  O'er sandy wilds were yellow harvests spread  The forests wonder'd at th'unusual grain  And secret transport touch'd the conscious swain  Fair Liberty Britannia's Goddess rears  Her chearful head and leads the golden years  Ye vig'rous swains while youth ferments your blood  And purer spirits swell the sprightly flood  Now range the hills the gameful woods beset  Wind the shrill horn or spread the waving net  When milder autumn summer's heat succeeds  And in the newshorn field the partridge feeds  Before his lord the ready spaniel bounds  Panting with hope he tries the furrow'd grounds  But when the tainted gales the game betray  Couch'd close he lies and meditates the prey  Secure they trust th' unfaithful field beset  'Till hov'ring o'er 'em sweeps the swelling net  Thus if small things we may with great compare  When Albion sends her eager sons to war  Some thoughtless Town with ease and plenty blest  Near and more near the closing lines invest  Sudden they seize th' amaz'd defenceless prize  And high in air Britannia's standard flies  See from the brake the whirring pheasant springs  And mounts exulting on triumphant wings  Short is his joy he feels the fiery wound  Flutters in blood and panting beats the ground  Ah what avail his glossy varying dyes  His purple crest and scarletcircled eyes  The vivid green his shining plumes unfold  His painted wings and breast that flames with gold  Nor yet when moist Arcturus clouds the sky  The woods and fields their pleasing toils deny  To plains with wellbreath'd beagles we repair  And trace the mazes of the circling hare  Beasts urg'd by us their fellowbeasts pursue  And learn of man each other to undo  With slaught'ring guns th' unweary'd fowler roves  When frosts have whiten'd all the naked groves  Where doves in flocks the leafless trees o'ershade  And lonely woodcocks haunt the wat'ry glade  He lifts the tube and levels with his eye  Strait a short thunder breaks the frozen sky  Oft as in airy rings they skim the heath  The clam'rous Lapwings feel the leaden death  Oft as the mounting larks their notes prepare  They fall and leave their little lives in air  In genial spring beneath the quiv'ring shade  Where cooling vapours breathe along the mead  The patient fisher takes his silent stand  Intent his angle trembling in his hand  With looks unmov'd he hopes the scaly breed  And eyes the dancing cork and bending reed  Our plenteous streams a various race supply  The brightey'd perch with fins of Tyrian dye  The silver eel in shining volumes roll'd  The yellow carp in scales bedrop'd with gold  Swift trouts diversify'd with crimson stains  And pykes the tyrants of the watry plains  Now Cancer glows with Phoebus' fiery car  The youth rush eager to the sylvan war  Swarm o'er the lawns the forest walks surround  Rouze the fleet hart and chear the opening hound  Th' impatient courser pants in ev'ry vein  And pawing seems to beat the distant plain  Hills vales and floods appear already cross'd  And e'er he starts a thousand steps are lost  See the bold youth strain up the threat'ning steep  Rush thro' the thickets down the valleys sweep  Hang o'er their coursers heads with eager speed  And earth rolls back beneath the flying steed  Let old Arcadia boast her ample plain  Th' immortal huntress and her virgintrain  Nor envy Windsor since thy shades have seen  As bright a Goddess and as chaste a QUEEN  Whose care like hers protects the sylvan reign  The Earth's fair light and Empress of the Main  Here too 'tis sung of old Diana stray'd  And Cynthus' top forsook for Windsor shade  Here was she seen o'er airy wastes to rove  Seek the clear spring or haunt the pathless grove  Here arm'd with silver bows in early dawn  Her buskin'd Virgins trac'd the dewy lawn  Above the rest a rural nymph was fam'd  Thy offspring Thames the fair Lodona nam'd  Lodona's fate in long oblivion cast  The Muse shall sing and what she sings shall last  Scarce could the Goddess from her nymph be known  But by the crescent and the golden zone  She scorn'd the praise of beauty and the care  A belt her waist a fillet binds her hair  A painted quiver on her shoulder sounds  And with her dart the flying deer she wounds  It chanc'd as eager of the chace the maid  Beyond the forest's verdant limits stray'd  Pan saw and lov'd and burning with desire  Pursu'd her flight her flight increas'd his fire  Not half so swift the trembling doves can fly  When the fierce eagle cleaves the liquid sky  Not half so swiftly the fierce eagle moves  When thro' the clouds he drives the trembling doves  As from the God she flew with furious pace  Or as the God more furious urg'd the chace  Now fainting sinking pale the nymph appears  Now close behind his sounding steps she hears  And now his shadow reach'd her as she run  His shadow lengthen'd by the setting sun  And now his shorter breath with sultry air  Pants on her neck and fans her parting hair  In vain on father Thames she calls for aid  Nor could Diana help her injur'd maid  Faint breathless thus she pray'd nor pray'd in vain  " Ah Cynthia ahtho' banish'd from thy train  " Let me O let me to the shades repair  " My native shadesthere weep and murmur there  She said and melting as in tears she lay  In a soft silver stream dissolv'd away  The silver stream her virgin coldness keeps  For ever murmurs and for ever weeps  Still bears the name the hapless virgin bore  And bathes the forest where she rang'd before  In her chaste current oft the Goddess laves  And with celestial tears augments the waves  Oft in her glass the musing shepherd spies  The headlong mountains and the downward skies  The watry landskip of the pendant woods  And absent trees that tremble in the floods  In the clear azure gleam the flocks are seen  And floating forests paint the waves with green  Thro' the fair scene roll slow the ling'ring streams  Then foaming pour along and rush into the Thames  Thou too great father of the British floods  With joyful pride survey'st our lofty woods  Where tow'ring oaks their growing honours rear  And future navies on thy shores appear  Not Neptune's self from all her streams receives  A wealthier tribute than to thine he gives  No seas so rich so gay no banks appear  No lake so gentle and no spring so clear  Nor Po so swells the fabling Poet's lays  While led along the skies his current strays  As thine which visits Windsor's fam'd abodes  To grace the mansion of our earthly Gods  Nor all his stars above a lustre show  Like the bright Beauties on thy banks below  Where Jove subdu'd by mortal Passion still  Might change Olympus for a nobler hill  Happy the man whom this bright Court approves  His Sov'reign favours and his Country loves  Happy next him who to these shades retires  Whom Nature charms and whom the Muse inspires  Whom humbler joys of homefelt quiet please  Successive study exercise and ease  He gathers health from herbs the forest yields  And of their fragant physic spoils the fields  With chymic art exalts the min'ral pow'rs  And draws the aromatic souls of flow'rs  Now marks the course of rolling orbs on high  O'er figur'd worlds now travels with his eye  Of ancient writ unlocks the learned store  Consults the dead and lives past ages o'er  Or wand'ring thoughtful in the silent wood  Attends the duties of the wise and good  T'observe a mean be to himself a friend  To follow nature and regard his end  Or looks on heav'n with more than mortal eyes  Bids his free soul expatiate in the skies  Amid her kindred stars familiar roam  Survey the region and confess her home  Such was the life great Scipio once admir'd  Thus Atticus and TRUMBAL thus retir'd  Ye sacred Nine that all my soul possess  Whose raptures fire me and whose visions bless  Bear me oh bear me to sequester'd scenes  The bow'ry mazes and surrounding greens  To Thames's banks which fragrant breezes fill  Or where ye Muses sport on COOPER'S HILL  On COOPER'S HILL eternal wreaths shall grow  While lasts the mountain or while Thames shall flow  I seem thro' consecrated walks to rove  I hear soft music die along the grove  Led by the sound I roam from shade to shade  By godlike Poets venerable made  Here his first lays majestic DENHAM sung  There the last numbers flow'd from COWLEY'S tongue  O early lost what tears the river shed  When the sad pomp along his banks was led  His drooping swans on ev'ry note expire  And on his willows hung each Muse's lyre  Since fate relentless stop'd their heav'nly voice  No more the forests ring or groves rejoice  Who now shall charm the shades where COWLEY strung  His living harp and lofty DENHAM sung  But hark the groves rejoice the forest rings  Are these reviv'd or is it GRANVILLE sings  'Tis yours my Lord to bless our soft retreats  And call the Muses to their ancient seats  To paint anew the flow'ry sylvan scenes  To crown the forests with immortal greens  Make Windsorhills in lofty numbers rise  And lift her turrets nearer to the skies  To sing those honours you deserve to wear  And add new lustre to her silver star  Here noble SURREY felt the sacred rage  SURREY the GRANVILLE of a former age  Matchless his pen victorious was his lance  Bold in the lists and graceful in the dance  In the same shades the Cupids tun'd his lyre  To the same notes of love and soft desire  Fair Geraldine bright object of his vow  Then fill'd the groves as heav'nly Mira now  Oh would'st thou sing what Heroes Windsor bore  What Kings first breath'd upon her winding shore  Or raise old warriours whose ador'd remains  In weeping vaults her hallow'd earth contains  With Edward's acts adorn the shining page  Stretch his long triumphs down thro' ev'ry age  Draw Monarchs chain'd and Cressi's glorious field  The lillies blazing on the regal shield  Then from her roofs when Verrio's colours fall  And leave inanimate the naked wall  Still in thy song should vanquish'd France appear  And bleed for ever under Britain's spear  Let softer strains illfated Henry mourn  And palms eternal flourish round his urn  Here o'er the MartyrKing the marble weeps  And fast beside him oncefear'd Edward sleeps  Whom not th' extended Albion could contain  From old Belerium to the northern main  The grave unites where ev'n the Great find rest  And blended lie th' oppressor and th' opprest  Make sacred Charles's tomb for ever known  Obscure the place and uninscrib'd the stone  Oh fact accurst what tears has Albion shed  Heav'ns what new wounds and how her old have bled  She saw her sons with purple deaths expire  Her sacred domes involv'd in rolling fire  A dreadful series of intestine wars  Inglorious triumphs and dishonest scars  At length great ANNA said"Let Discord cease"  She said the world obey'd and all was Peace  In that blest moment from his oozy bed  Old father Thames advanc'd his rev'rend head  His tresses drop'd with dews and o'er the stream  His shining horns diffus'd a golden gleam  Grav'd on his urn appear'd the moon that guides  His swelling waters and alternate tides  The figur'd streams in waves of silver roll'd  And on their banks Augusta rose in gold  Around his throne the seaborn brothers stood  Who swell with tributary urns his flood  First the fam'd authors of his ancient name  The winding Isis and the fruitful Tame  The Kennet swift for silver eels renown'd  The Loddon slow with verdant alders crown'd  Cole whose dark streams his flow'ry islands lave  And chalky Wey that rolls a milky wave  The blue transparent Vandalis appears  The gulphy Lee his sedgy tresses rears  And sullen Mole that hides his diving flood  And silent Darent stain'd with Danish blood  High in the midst upon his urn reclin'd  His seagreen mantle waving with the wind  The God appear'd he turn'd his azure eyes  Where Windsordomes and pompous turrets rise  Then bow'd and spoke the winds forget to roar  And the hush'd waves glide softly to the shore  Hail sacred Peace hail longexpected days  That Thames's glory to the stars shall raise  Tho' Tyber's streams immortal Rome behold  Tho' foaming Hermus swells with tides of gold  From heav'n itself tho' sev'nfold Nilus flows  And harvests on a hundred realms bestows  These now no more shall be the Muse's themes  Lost in my fame as in the sea their streams  Let Volga's banks with iron squadrons shine  And groves of lances glitter on the Rhine  Let barb'rous Ganges arm a servile train  Be mine the blessings of a peaceful reign  No more my sons shall die with British blood  Red Iber's sands or Ister's foaming flood  Safe on my shore each unmolested swain  Shall tend the flocks or reap the bearded grain  The shady empire shall retain no trace  Of war or blood but in the sylvan chace  The trumpet sleep while chearful horns are blown  And arms employ'd on birds and beasts alone  Behold th' ascending Villa's on my side  Project long shadows o'er the crystal tide  Behold Augusta's glitt'ring spires increase  And Temples rise the beauteous works of Peace  I see I see where two fair cities bend  Their ample bow a new Whitehall ascend  There mighty Nations shall enquire their doom  The World's great Oracle in times to come  There Kings shall sue and suppliant States be seen  Once more to bend before a BRITISH QUEEN  Thy trees fair Windsor now shall leave their woods  And half thy forests rush into thy floods  Bear Britain's thunder and her Cross display  To the bright regions of the rising day  Tempt icy seas where scarce the waters roll  Where clearer flames glow round the frozen Pole  Or under southern skies exalt their sails  Led by new stars and borne by spicy gales  For me the balm shall bleed and amber flow  The coral redden and the ruby glow  The pearly shell its lucid globe infold  And Phoebus warm the rip'ning ore to gold  The time shall come when free as seas or wind  Unbounded Thames shall flow for all mankind  Whole nations enter with each swelling tide  And seas but join the regions they divide  Earth's distant ends our glory shall behold  And the new world launch forth to seek the old  Then ships of uncouth form shall stem the tyde  And feather'd people croud my wealthy side  And naked youths and painted chiefs admire  Our speech our colour and our strange attire  Oh stretch thy reign fair Peace from shore to shore  'Till Conquest cease and Slav'ry be no more  'Till the freed Indians in their native groves  Reap their own fruits and woo their sable loves  Peru once more a race of Kings behold  And other Mexico's be roof'd with gold  Exil'd by thee from earth to deepest hell  In brazen bonds shall barb'rous Discord dwell  Gigantic Pride pale Terror gloomy Care  And mad Ambition shall attend her there  There purple Vengeance bath'd in gore retires  Her weapons blunted and extinct her fires  There hateful Envy her own snakes shall feel  And Persecution mourn her broken wheel  There Faction roar Rebellion bite her chain  And gasping Furies thirst for blood in vain  Here cease thy flight nor with unhallow'd lays  Touch the fair fame of Albion's golden days  The thoughts of Gods let GRANVILLE'S verse recite  And bring the scenes of op'ning fate to light  My humble Muse in unambitious strains  Paints the green forests and the flow'ry plains  Where Peace descending bids her olives spring  And scatters blessings from her dovelike wing  Ev'n I more sweetly pass my careless days  Pleas'd in the silent shade with empty praise  Enough for me that to

into voice each silent string  And sweep the sounding lyre  In a sadlypleasing strain  Let the warbling lute complain  Let the loud trumpet sound  'Till the roofs all around  The shrill echos rebound  While in more lengthen'd notes and slow  The deep majestic solemn organs blow  Hark the numberssoft and clear  Gently steal upon the ear  Now louder and yet louder rise  And fill with spreading sounds the skies  Exulting in triumph now swell the bold notes  In broken air trembling the wild music floats  'Till by degrees remote and small  The strains decay  And melt away  In a dying dying fall  II  By Music minds an equal temper know  Nor swell too high nor sink too low  If in the breast tumultuous joys arise  Music her soft assuasive voice applies  Or when the soul is press'd with cares  Exalts her in enlivening airs  Warriors she fires with animated sounds  Pours balm into the bleeding lover's wounds  Melancholy lifts her head  Morpheus rouzes from his bed  Sloth unfolds her arms and wakes  List'ning Envy drops her snakes  Intestine war no more our Passions wage  And giddy Factions hear away their rage  III  But when our Country's cause provokes to Arms  How martial music ev'ry bosom warms  So when the first bold vessel dar'd the seas  High on the stern the Thracian rais'd his strain  While Argo saw her kindred trees  Descend from Pelion to the main  Transported demigods stood round  And men grew heroes at the sound  Enflam'd with glory's charms  Each chief his sev'nfold shield display'd  And half unsheath'd the shining blade  And seas and rocks and skies rebound  To arms to arms to arms  IV  But when thro' all th' infernal bounds  Which flaming Phlegeton surrounds  Love strong as Death the Poet led  To the pale nations of the dead  What sounds were heard  What scenes appear'd  O'er all the dreary coasts  Dreadful gleams  Dismal screams  Fires that glow  Shrieks of woe  Sullen moans  Hollow groans  And cries of tortur'd ghosts  But hark he strikes the golden lyre  And see the tortur'd ghosts respire  See shady forms advance  Thy stone O Sysiphus stands still  Ixion rests upon his wheel  And the pale spectres dance  The Furies sink upon their iron beds  And snakes uncurl'd hang list'ning round their heads  V  By the streams that ever flow  By the fragrant winds that blow  O'er th' Elysian flow'rs  By those happy souls who dwell  In yellow meads of Asphodel  Or Amaranthine bow'rs  By the hero's armed shades  Glitt'ring thro' the gloomy glades  By the youths that dy'd for love  Wand'ring in the myrtle grove  Restore restore Eurydice to life  Oh take the husband or return the wife  He sung and hell consented  To hear the Poet's prayer  Stern Proserpine relented  And gave him back the fair  Thus song could prevail  O'er death and o'er hell  A conquest how hard and how glorious  Tho' fate had fast bound her  With Styx nine times round her  Yet music and love were victorious  VI  But soon too soon the lover turns his eyes  Again she falls again she dies she dies  How wilt thou now the fatal sisters move  No crime was thine if 'tis no crime to love  Now under hanging mountains  Beside the falls of fountains  Or where Hebrus wanders  Rolling in Maeanders  All alone  Unheard unknown  He makes his moan  And calls her ghost  For ever ever ever lost  Now with Furies surrounded  Despairing confounded  He trembles he glows  Amidst Rhodope's snows  See wild as the winds o'er the desart he flies  Hark Haemus resounds with the Bacchanals cries  Ah see he dies  Yet ev'n in death Eurydice he sung  Eurydice still trembled on his tongue  Eurydice the woods  Eurydice the floods  Eurydice the rocks and hollow mountains rung  VII  Music the fiercest grief can charm  And fate's severest rage disarm  Music can soften pain to ease  And make despair and madness please  Our joys below it can improve  And antedate the bliss above  This the divine Cecilia found  And to her Maker's praise confin'd the sound  When the full organ joins the tuneful quire  Th' immortal pow'rs incline their ear  Borne on the swelling notes our souls aspire  While solemn airs improve the sacred fire  And Angels lean from heav'n to hear  Of Orpheus now no more let Poets tell  To bright Cecilia greater power is giv'n  His numbers rais'd a shade from hell  Hers lift the soul to heav'n  REMARKS  Ode for Music    This is one of the most artful as well as sublime of our Poet's smaller compositions The  first  stanza is a description of the various tones and measures in music The  second  relates their power over the several passions in general The  third  their use in inspiring the Heroic passions in particular The  fourth fifth  and  sixth  their power over all nature in the fable of Orpheus's expedition to hell which subject of illustration arose naturally out of the preceding mention of the Argonautic  expedition where Orpheus gives an example of the use of Music to inspire the heroic passions The  seventh  and last concludes in praise of Music and the advantages of the sacred above the prophane  VER  Let the loud trumpet sound etc    Our Author in his rules for good writing had said that  the sound should be an coho to the sense  The graces it adds to the harmony are obvious But we should never have seen all the advantages arising from it had this ode not been written In which one may venture to say is found all the harmony that sound when it comes in aid of sense is capable of producing  TWO CHORUS'S TO THE Tragedy of BRUTUS  Altered from Shakespear by the Duke of Buckingham at whose desire these two Chorus's were composed to supply as many wanting in his play They were set many years afterwards by the famous Bononcini and performed at Buckinghamhouse  P    CHORUS of ATHENIANS  STROPHE I  YE shades where sacred truth is sought  Groves where immortal Sages taught  Where heav'nly visions Plato fir'd  And Epicurus lay inspir'd  In vain your guiltless laurels stood  Unspotted long with human blood  War horrid war your thoughtful walks invades  And steel now glitters in the Muses shades  ANTISTROPHE I  Oh heav'nborn sisters source of art  Who charm the sense or mend the heart  Who lead fair Virtue's train along  Moral Truth and mystic Song  To what new clime what distant sky  Forsaken friendless shall ye fly  Say will ye bless the bleak Atlantic shore  Or bid the furious Gaul be rude no more  STROPHE II  When Athens sinks by fates unjust  When wild Barbarians spurn her dust  Perhaps ev'n Britain's utmost shore  Shall cease to blush with stranger's gore  See Arts her savage sons controul  And Athens rising near the pole  'Till some new Tyrant lifts his purple hand  And civil madness tears them from the land  ANTISTROPHE II  Ye Gods what justice rules the ball  Freedom and Arts together fall  Fools grant whate'er Ambition craves  And men once ignorant are slaves  Oh curs'd effects of civil hate  In ev'ry age in ev'ry state  Still when the lust of tyrant power succeeds  Some Athens perishes some Tully bleeds  REMARKS  THESE two Chorus's were composed to enrich a very poor Play but they had the usual effect of illadjusted Ornaments to make its meanness but the more conspicuous  VER  Where heav'nly visions Plato fir'd  And Epicurus lay inspir'd    The propriety of these lines arises from hence that  Brutus  one of the Heroes of this Play was of the Old Academy and  Cassius  the other was an Epicurean but this had not been enough to justify the Poet's choice had not Plato's system of  Divinity  and Epicurus's system of  Morals  been the most rational amongst the various sects of Greek Philosophy  VER  Moral truth  AND  mystic song    He had expressed himself better had he said  " Moral truth IN mystic song  In the Antistrophe he turns from  Philosophy  to  Mythology  and Mythology is nothing but  moral truth in mystic song  CHORUS of  Youths  and  Virgins  SEMICHORUS  OH Tyrant Love hast thou possest  The prudent learn'd and virtuous breast  Wisdom and wit in vain reclaim  And Arts but soften us to feel thy flame  Love soft intruder enters here  But entring learns to be sincere  Marcus with blushes owns he loves  And Brutus tenderly reproves  Why Virtue dost thou blame desire  Which Nature has imprest  Why Nature dost thou soonest fire  The mild and gen'rous breast  CHORUS  Love's purer flames the Gods approve  The Gods and Brutus bend to love  Brutus for absent Portia sighs  And sterner Cassius melts at Junia's eyes  What is loose love a transient gust  Spent in a sudden storm of lust  A vapour fed from wild desire  A wand'ring selfconsuming fire  But Hymen's kinder flames unite  And burn for ever one  Chaste as cold Cynthia's virgin light  Productive as the Sun  SEMICHORUS  Oh source of ev'ry social tye  United wish and mutual joy  What various joys on one attend  As son as father brother husband friend  Whether his hoary sire he spies  While thousand grateful thoughts arise  Or meets his spouse's fonder eye  Or views his smiling progeny  What tender passions take their turns  What homefelt raptures move  His heart now melts now leaps now burns  With rev'rence hope and love  CHORUS  Hence guilty joys distastes surmizes  Hence false tears deceits disguises  Dangers doubts delays surprizes  Fires that scorch yet dare not shine  Purest love's unwasting treasure  Constant faith sair hope long leisure  Days of ease and nights of pleasure  Sacred Hymen these are thine  These two Chorus's are enough to shew us his great talents for this species of Poetry and to make us lament he did not prosecute his purpose in executing some plans he had chalked out but the Character of the Managers of Playhouses was what he said soon determined him to lay aside all thoughts of this nature    REMARKS  VER  Why Virtue etc    In allusion to that famous conceit of Guarini  " Se il peccare è si dolce etc  ODE on SOLITUDE  This was a very early production of our Author written at about twelve years old  P    HAPPY the man whose wish and care  A few paternal acres bound  Content to breathe his native air  In his own ground  Whose herds with milk whose fields with bread  Whose flocks supply him with attire  Whose trees in summer yield him shade  In winter fire  Blest who can unconcern'dly find  Hours days and years slide soft away  In health of body peace of mind  Quiet by day  Sound sleep by night study and ease  Together mixt sweet recreation  And innocence which most does please  With meditation  Thus let me live unseen unknown  Thus unlamented let me die  Steal from the world and not a stone  Tell where I lie  The dying Christian to his SOUL  ODE  This ode was written in imitation of the famous sonnet of Hadrian to his departing soul but as much superior in sense and sublimity to his original as the  Christian  Religion is to the  Pagan    I  VITAL spark of heav'nly flame  Quit oh quit this mortal frame  Trembling hoping ling'ring flying  Oh the pain the bliss of dying  Cease fond Nature cease thy strife  And let me languish into life  II  Hark they whisper Angels say  Sister Spirit come away  What is this absorbs me quite  Steals my senses shuts my sight  Drowns my spirits draws my breath  Tell me my Soul can this be Death  III  The world recedes it disappears  Heav'n opens on my eyes my ears  With sounds seraphic ring  Lend lend your wings I mount I fly  O Grave where is thy Victory  O Death where is thy Sting  AN ESSAY ON CRITICISM  Written in the Year MDCCIX  CONTENTS OF THE ESSAY on CRITICISM  PART I  INtroduction That 'tis as great a fault to judge ill as to write ill and a more

greater want of skill  Appear in writing or in judging ill  But of the two less dang'rous is th' offence  To tire our patience than mislead our sense  Some few in that but numbers err in this  Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss  A fool might once himself alone expose  Now one in verse makes many more in prose  'Tis with our judgments as our watches none  Go just alike yet each believes his own  In Poets as true genius is but rare  True Taste as seldom is the Critic's share  Both must alike from Heav'n derive their light  These born to judge as well as those to write  Let such teach others who themselves excel  And censure freely who have written well  Authors are partial to their wit 'tis true  But are not Critics to their judgment too  Yet if we look more closely we shall find  Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind  Nature affords at least a glimm'ring light  The lines tho' touch'd but faintly are drawn right  But as the slightest sketch if justly trac'd  Is by illcolouring but the more disgrac'd  So by false learning is good sense defac'd  Some are bewilder'd in the maze of schools  And some made coxcombs Nature meant but fools  In search of wit these lose their common sense  And then turn Critics in their own defence  Each burns alike who can or cannot write  Or with a Rival's or an Eunuch's spite  All fools have still an itching to deride  And fain would be upon the laughing side  If Maevius scribble in Apollo's spight  There are who judge still worse than he can write  Some have at first for Wits then Poets past  Turn'd Critics next and prov'd plain fools at last  Some neither can for Wits nor Critics pass  As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass  Those halflearn'd witlings num'rous in our isle  As halfform'd insects on the banks of Nile  Unfinish'd things one knows not what to call  Their generation's so equivocal  To tell 'em would a hundred tongues require  Or one vain wit's that might a hundred tire  But you who seek to give and merit fame  And justly bear a Critic's noble name  Be sure yourself and your own reach to know  How far your genius taste and learning go  Launch not beyond your depth but be discreet  And mark that point where sense and dullness meet  Nature to all things fix'd the limits fit  And wisely curb'd proud man's pretending wit  As on the land while here the ocean gains  In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains  Thus in the soul while memory prevails  The solid pow'r of understanding fails  Where beams of warm imagination play  The memory's soft figures melt away  One science only will one genius fit  So vast is art so narrow human wit  Not only bounded to peculiar arts  But oft' in those confin'd to single parts  Like Kings we lose the conquests gain'd before  By vain ambition still to make them more  Each might his sev'ral province well command  Would all but stoop to what they understand  First follow Nature and your judgment frame  By her just standard which is still the same  Unerring NATURE still divinely bright  One clear unchang'd and universal light  Life force and beauty must to all impart  At once the source and end and test of Art  Art from that fund each just supply provides  Works without show and without pomp presides  In some fair body thus th' informing soul  With spirits feeds with vigour fills the whole  Each motion guides and ev'ry nerve sustains  Itself unseen but in th' effects remains  Some to whom Heav'n in wit has been profuse  Want as much more to turn it to its use  For wit and judgment often are at strife  Tho' meant each other's aid like man and wife  'Tis more to guide than spur the Muse's steed  Restrain his fury than provoke his speed  The winged courser like a gen'rous horse  Shows most true mettle when you check his course  Those RULES of old discover'd not devis'd  Are Nature still but Nature methodiz'd  Nature like Liberty is but restrain'd  By the same Laws which first herself ordain'd  Hear how learn'd Greece her useful rules indites  When to repress and when indulge our flights  High on Parnassus' top her sons she show'd  And pointed out those arduous paths they trod  Held from afar aloft th' immortal prize  And urg'd the rest by equal steps to rise  Just precepts thus from great examples giv'n  She drew from them what they deriv'd from Heav'n  The gen'rous Critic fann'd the Poet's fire  And taught the world with reason to admire  Then Criticism the Muses handmaid prov'd  To dress her charms and make her more belov'd  But following wits from that intention stray'd  Who cou'd not win the mistress woo'd the maid  Against the Poets their own arms they turn'd  Sure to hate most the men from whom they learn'd  So modern 'Pothecaries taught the art  By Doctor's bills to play the Doctor's part  Bold in the practice of mistaken rules  Prescribe apply and call their masters fools  Some on the leaves of antient authors prey  Nor time nor moths e'er spoil'd so much as they  Some drily plain without invention's aid  Write dull receits how poems may be made  These leave the sense their learning to display  And those explain the meaning quite away  You then whose judgment the right course would steer  Know well each ANCIENT'S proper character  His Fable Subject scope in ev'ry page  Religion Country genius of his Age  Without all these at once before your eyes  Cavil you may but never criticize  Be Homer's works your study and delight  Read them by day and meditate by night  Thence form your judgment thence your maxims bring  And trace the Muses upward to their spring  Still with itself compar'd his text peruse  And let your comment be the Mantuan Muse  When first young Maro in his boundless mind  A work t'outlast immortal Rome design'd  Perhaps he seem'd above the Critic's law  And but from Nature's fountains scorn'd to draw  But when t'examine ev'ry part he came  Nature and Homer were he found the same  Convinc'd amaz'd he checks the bold design  And rules as strict his labour'd work confine  As if the Stagirite o'erlook'd each line  Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem  To copy nature is to copy them  Some beauties yet no Precepts can declare  For there's a happiness as well as care  Music resembles Poetry in each  Are nameless graces which no methods teach  And which a masterhand alone can reach  If where the rules not far enough extend  Since rules were made but to promote their end  Some lucky Licence answer to the full  Th'intent propos'd that Licence is a rule  Thus Pegasus a nearer way to take  May boldly deviate from the common track  From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part  And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art  Which without passing thro' the judgment gains  The heart and all its end at once attains  In prospects thus some objects please our eyes  Which out of nature's common order rise  The shapeless rock or hanging precipice  Great Wits sometimes may gloriously offend  And rise to faults true Critics dare not mend  But tho' the Ancients thus their rules invade  As Kings dispense with laws themselves have made  Moderns beware or if you must offend  Against the precept ne'er transgress its End  Let it be seldom and compell'd by need  And have at least their precedent to plead  The Critic else proceeds without remorse  Seizes your fame and puts his laws in force  I know there are to whose presumptuous thoughts  Those freer beauties ev'n in them seem faults  Some figures monstrous and misshap'd appear  Consider'd singly or beheld too near  Which but proportion'd to their light or place  Due distance reconciles to form and grace  A prudent chief not always must display  His pow'rs in equal ranks and fair array  But with th'occasion and the place comply  Conceal his force nay seem sometimes to fly  Those oft are stratagems which errors seem  Nor is it Homer nods but we that dream  Still green with bays each ancient Altar stands  Above the reach of sacrilegious hands  Secure from Flames from Envy's fiercer rage  Destructive War and allinvolving Age  See from each clime the learn'd their incense bring  Hear in all tongues consenting Paeans ring  In praise so just let ev'ry voice be join'd  And fill the gen'ral chorus of mankind  Hail Bards triumphant born in happier days  Immortal heirs of universal praise  Whose honours with increase of ages grow  As streams roll down enlarging as they flow  Nations unborn your mighty names shall sound  And worlds applaud that must not yet be found  Oh may some spark of your celestial fire  The last the meanest of your sons inspire  That on weak wings from far pursues your flights  Glows while he reads but trembles as he writes  To teach vain Wits a science little known  T'admire superior sense and doubt their own  OF all the Causes which conspire to blind  Man's erring judgment and misguide the mind  What the weak head with strongest bias rules  Is  Pride  the neverfailing vice of fools  Whatever Nature has in worth deny'd  She gives in large recruits of needful Pride  For as in bodies thus in souls we find  What wants in blood and spirits swell'd with wind  Pride where Wit fails steps in to our defence  And fills up all the mighty Void of sense  If once right reason drives that cloud away  Truth breaks upon us with resistless day  Trust not yourself but your defects to know  Make use of ev'ry friendand ev'ry foe  A  little learning  is a dang'rous thing  Drink deep or taste not the Pierian spring  There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain  And drinking largely sobers us again  Fir'd at first sight with what the Muse imparts  In fearless youth we tempt the heights of Arts  While from the bounded level of our mind  Short views we take nor see the lengths behind  But more advanc'd behold with strange surprize  New distant scenes of endless science rise  So pleas'd at first the tow'ring Alps we try  Mount o'er the vales and seem to tread the sky  Th' eternal snows appear already past  And the first clouds and mountains seem the last  But those attain'd we tremble to survey  The growing labours of the lengthen'd way  Th' increasing prospect tires our wand'ring eyes  Hills peep o'er hills and Alps on Alps arise  A perfect Judge will read each work of Wit  With the same spirit that its author writ  Survey the WHOLE nor seek slight faults to find  Where nature moves and rapture warms the mind  Nor lose for that malignant dull delight  The gen'rous pleasure to be charm'd with wit  But in such lays as neither ebb nor flow  Correctly cold and regularly low  That shunning faults one quiet tenour keep  We cannot blame indeedbut we may sleep  In Wit as Nature what affects our hearts  Is not th' exactness of peculiar parts  'Tis not a lip or eye we beauty call  But the joint force and full result of all  Thus when we view some wellproportion'd dome  The world's just wonder and ev'n thine ORome  No single parts unequally surprize  All comes united to th' admiring eyes  No monstrous height or breadth or length appear  The Whole at once is bold and regular  Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see  Thinks what ne'er was nor is nor e'er shall be  In ev'ry work regard the writer's End  Since none can compass more than they intend  And if the means be just the conduct true  Applause in spight of trivial faults is due  As men of breeding sometimes men of wit  T' avoid great errors must the less commit  Neglect the rules each verbal Critic lays  For not to know some trifles is a praise  Most Critics fond of some subservient art  Still make the Whole depend upon a Part  They talk of principles but notions prize  And all to one lov'd Folly sacrifice  Once on a time La Mancha's Knight they say  A certain Bard encount'ring on the way  Discours'd in terms as just with looks as sage  As e'er could Dennis of the Grecian stage  Concluding all were desp'rate sots and fools  Who durst depart from Aristotle's rules  Our Author happy in a judge so nice  Produc'd his Play and begg'd the Knight's advice  Made him observe the subject and the plot  The manners passions unities what not  All which exact to rule were brought about  Were but a Combat in the lists left out  " What leave the Combat out" exclaims the Knight  Yes or we must renounce the Stagirite  " Not so by Heav'n" he answers in a rage  " Knights squires and steeds must enter on the stage"  So vast a throng the stage can ne'er contain  " Then build a new or act it in a plain"  Thus Critics of less judgment than caprice  Curious not knowing not exact but nice  Form short Ideas and offend in arts  As most in manners by a love to parts  Some to  Conceit  alone their taste confine  And glitt'ring thoughts struck out at ev'ry line  Pleas'd with a work where nothing's just or fit  One glaring Chaos and wild heap of wit  Poets like painters thus unskill'd to trace  The naked nature and the living grace  With gold and jewels cover ev'ry part  And hide with ornaments their want of art  True Wit is Nature to advantage dress'd  What oft was thought but ne'er so well express'd  Something whose truth convinc'd at sight we find  That gives us back the image of our mind  As shades more sweetly recommend the light  So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit  For works may have more wit than does 'em good  As bodies perish thro' excess of blood  Others for  Language  all their care express  And value books as women men for Dress  Their praise is stillthe Style is excellent  The Sense they humbly take upon content  Words are like leaves and where they most abound  Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found  False Eloquence like the prismatic glass  Its gaudy colours spreads on ev'ry place  The face of Nature we no more survey  All glares alike without distinction gay  But true Expression like th' unchanging Sun  Clears and improves whate'er it shines upon  It gilds all objects but it alters none  Expression is the dress of thought and still  Appears more decent as more suitable  A vile conceit in pompous words express'd  Is like a clown in regal purple dress'd  For diff'rent styles with diff'rent subjects sort  As several garbs with country town and court  Some by old words to fame have made pretence  Ancients in phrase meer moderns in their sense  Such labour'd nothings in so strange a style  Amaze th' unlearn'd and make the learned smile  Unlucky as Fungoso in the Play  These sparks with aukward vanity display  What the fine gentleman wore yesterday  And but so mimic ancient wits at best  As apes our grandfires in their doublets drest  In words as fashions the same rule will hold  Alike fantastic if too new or old  Be not the first by whom the new are try'd  Nor yet the last to lay the old aside  But most by Numbers judge a Poet's song  And smooth or rough with them is right or wrong  In the bright Muse tho' thousand charms conspire  Her Voice is all these tuneful fools admire  Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear  Not mend their minds as some to Church repair  Not for the doctrine but the music there  These equal syllables alone require  Tho' oft the ear the open vowels tire  While expletives their feeble aid do join  And ten low words oft creep in one dull line  While they ring round the same unvary'd chimes  With sure returns of still expected rhymes  Wheree'er you find "the cooling western breeze"  In the next line it "whispers thro' the trees"  If crystal streams "with pleasing murmurs creep"  The reader's threaten'd not in vain with "sleep"  Then at the last and only couplet fraught  With some unmeaning thing they call a thought  A needless Alexandrine ends the song  That like a wounded snake drags its slow length along  Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes and know  What's roundly smooth or languishingly slow  And praise the easy vigour of a line  Where Denham's strength and Waller's sweetness join  True ease in writing comes from art not chance  As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance  'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence  The sound must seem an Echo to the sense  Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows  And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows  But when loud surges lash the sounding shoar  The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar  When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw  The line too labours and the words move slow  Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain  Flies o'er th' unbending corn and skims along the main  Hear how Timotheus' vary'd lays surprize  And bid alternate passions fall and rise  While at each change the son of Libyan Jove  Now burns with glory and then melts with love  Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow  Now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow  Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found  And the World's victor stood subdu'd by Sound  The pow'r of Music all our hearts allow  And what Timotheus was is DRYDEN now  Avoid Extremes and shun the fault of such  Who still are pleas'd too little or too much  At ev'ry trifle scorn to take offence  That always shows great pride or little sense  Those heads as stomachs are not sure the best  Which nauseate all and nothing can digest  Yet let not each gay Turn thy rapture move  For fools admire but men of sense approve  As things seem large which we thro' mists descry  Dulness is ever apt to magnify  Some foreign writers some our own despise  The Ancients only or the Moderns prize  Thus Wit like Faith by each man is apply'd  To one small sect and all are damn'd beside  Meanly they seek the blessing to confine  And force that sun but on a part to shine  Which not alone the southern wit sublimes  But ripens spirits in cold northern climes  Which from the first has shone on ages past  Enlights the present and shall warm the last  Tho' each may feel encreases and decays  And see now clearer and now darker days  Regard not then if Wit be old or new  But blame the false and value still the true  Some ne'er advance a Judgment of their own  But catch the spreading notion of the Town  They reason and conclude by precedent  And own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent  Some judge of authors names not works and then  Nor praise nor blame the writings but the men  Of all this servile herd the worst is he  That in proud dulness joins with Quality  A constant Critic at the great man's board  To fetch and carry nonsense for my Lord  What woful stuff this madrigal would be  In some starv'd hackney sonneteer or me  But let a Lord once own the happy lines  How the wit brightens how the style refines  Before his sacred name flies ev'ry fault  And each exalted stanza teems with thought  The Vulgar thus through Imitation err  As oft the Learn'd by being singular  So much they scorn the croud that if the throng  By chance go right they purposely go wrong  So Schismatics the plain believers quit  And are but damn'd for having too much wit  Some praise at morning what they blame at night  But always think the last opinion right  A Muse by these is like a mistress us'd  This hour she's idoliz'd the next abus'd  While their weak heads like towns unfortify'd  Twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side  Ask them the cause they're wiser still they say  And still tomorrow's wiser than today  We think our fathers fools so wise we grow  Our wiser sons no doubt will think us so  Once Schooldivines this zealous isle o'erspread  Who knew most Sentences was deepest read  Faith Gospel all seem'd made to be disputed  And none had sense enough to be confuted  Scotists and Thomists now in peace remain  Amidst their kindred cobwebs in Ducklane  If Faith itself has diff'rent dresses worn  What wonder modes in Wit should take their turn  Oft' leaving what is natural and fit  The current folly proves the ready wit  And authors think their reputation safe  Which lives as long as fools are pleas'd to laugh  Some valuing those of their own side or mind  Still make themselves the measure of mankind  Fondly we think we honour merit then  When we but praise ourselves in other men  Parties in Wit attend on those of State  And public faction doubles private hate  Pride Malice Folly against Dryden rose  In various shapes of Parsons Critics Beaus  But sense surviv'd when merry jests were past  For rising merit will buoy up at last  Might he return and bless once more our eyes  New Blackmores and new Milbourns must arise  Nay should great Homer lift his awful head  Zoilus again would start up from the dead  Envy will merit as its shade pursue  But like a shadow proves the substance true  For envy'd Wit like Sol eclips'd makes known  Th' opposing body's grossness not its own  When first that sun too pow'rful beams displays  It draws up vapours which obscure its rays  But ev'n those clouds at last adorn its way  Reflect new glories and augment the day  Be thou the first true merit to befriend  His praise is lost who stays 'till all commend  Short is the date alas of modern rhymes  And 'tis but just to let them live betimes  No longer now that golden age appears  When Patriarchwits surviv'd a thousand years  Now length of Fame our second life is lost  And bare threescore is all ev'n that can boast  Our sons their fathers failing language see  And such as Chaucer is shall Dryden be  So when the faithful pencil has design'd  Some bright Idea of the master's mind  Where a new world leaps out at his command  And ready Nature waits upon his hand  When the ripe colours soften and unite  And sweetly melt into just shade and light  When mellowing years their full perfection give  And each bold figure just begins to live  The treach'rous colours the fair art betray  And all the bright creation fades away  Unhappy Wit like most mistaken things  Atones not sor that envy which it brings  In youth alone its empty praise we boast  But soon the shortliv'd vanity is lost  Like some fair flow'r the early spring supplies  That gayly blooms but ev'n in blooming dies  What is this Wit which must our cares employ  The owner's wife that other men enjoy  Then most our trouble still when most admir'd  And still the more we give the more requir'd  Whose fame with pains we guard but lose with ease  Sure some to vex but never all to please  'Tis what the vicious fear the virtuous shun  By fools 'tis hated and by knaves undone  If Wit so much from Ign'rance undergo  Ah let not Learning too commence its foe  Of old those met rewards who could excell  And such were prais'd who but endeavour'd well  Tho' triumphs were to gen'rals only due  Crowns were reserv'd to grace the soldiers too  Now they who reach Parnassus' lofty crown  Employ their pains to spurn some others down  And while selflove each jealous writer rules  Contending wits become the sport of fools  But still the worst with most regret commend  For each ill Author is as bad a Friend  To what base ends and by what abject ways  Are mortals urg'd thro' sacred lust of praise  Ah ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boast  Nor in the Critic let the Man be lost  Goodnature and goodsense must ever join  To err is human to forgive divine  But if in noble minds some dregs remain  Not yet purg'd off of spleen and four disdain  Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes  Nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times  No pardon vile Obscenity should find  Tho' wit and art conspire to move your mind  But Dulness with Obscenity must prove  As shameful sure as Impotence in love  In the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease  Sprung the rank weed and thriv'd with large increase  When love was all an easy Monarch's care  Seldom at council never in a war  Jilts rul'd the state and statesmen farces writ  Nay wits had pensions and young Lords had wit  The Fair sate panting at a Courtier's play  And not a Mask went unimprov'd away  The modest fan was lifted up no more  And Virgins smil'd at what they blush'd before  The following licence of a Foreign reign  Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain  Then unbelieving Priests reform'd the nation  And taught more pleasant methods of salvation  Where Heav'n's free subjects might their rights dispute  Lest God himself should seem too absolute  Pulpits their sacred satire learn'd to spare  And Vice admir'd to find a flatt'rer there  Encourag'd thus Wit's Titans brav'd the skies  And the press groan'd with licens'd blasphemies  These monsters Critics with your darts engage  Here point your thunder and exhaust your rage  Yet shun their fault who scandalously nice  Will needs mistake an author into vice  All seems infected that th' infected spy  As all looks yellow to the jaundic'd eye  LEARN then what MORALS Critics ought to show  For 'tis but half a Judge's task to know  'Tis not enough taste judgment learning join  In all you speak let truth and candour shine  That not alone what to your sense is due  All may allow but seek your friendship too  Be silent always when you doubt your sense  And speak tho' sure with seeming diffidence  Some positive persisting fops we know  Who if once wrong will needs be always so  But you with pleasure own your errors past  And make each day a Critic on the last  'Tis not enough your counsel still be true  Blunt truths more mischief than nice falshoods do  Men must be taught as if you taught them not  And things unknown propos'd as things forgot  Without Good Breeding truth is disapprov'd  That only makes superior sense belov'd  Be niggards of advice on no pretence  For the worst avarice is that of sense  With mean complacence ne'er betray your trust  Nor be so civil as to prove unjust  Fear not the anger of the wise to raise  Those best can bear reproof who merit praise  'Twere well might Critics still this freedom take  But Appius reddens at each word you speak  And stares tremendous with a threat'ning eye  Like some fierce Tyrant in old tapestry  Fear most to tax an Honourable fool  Whose right it is uncensur'd to be dull  Such without wit are Poets when they please  As without learning they can take Degrees  Leave dang'rous truths to unsuccessful Satires  And flattery to fulsome Dedicators  Whom when they praise the world believes no more  Than when they promise to give scribling o'er  'Tis best sometimes your censure to restrain  And charitably let the dull be vain  Your silence there is better than your spite  For who can rail so long as they can write  Still humming on their drouzy course they keep  And lash'd so long like tops are lash'd asleep  False steps but help them to renew the race  As after stumbling Jades will mend their pace  What crouds of these impenitently bold  In sounds and jingling syllables grown old  Still run on Poets in a raging vein  Ev'n to the dregs and squeezings of the brain  Strain out the last dull droppings of their sense  And rhyme with all the rage of Impotence  Such shameless Bards we have and yet 'tis true  There are as mad abandon'd Critics too  The bookful blockhead ignorantly read  With loads of learned lumber in his head  With his own tongue still edifies his ears  And always list'ning to himself appears  All books he reads and all he reads assails  From Dryden's Fables down to Durfey's Tales  With him most authors steal their works or buy  Garth did not write his own Dispensary  Name a new Play and he's the Poet's friend  Nay show'd his faultsbut when would Poets mend  No place so sacred from such fops is barr'd  Nor is Paul's church more safe than Paul's church yard  Nay fly to Altars there they'll talk you dead  For Fools rush in where Angels fear to tread  Distrustful sense with modest caution speaks  It still looks home and short excursions makes  But rattling nonsense in full vollies breaks  And never shock'd and never turn'd aside  Bursts out resistless with a thund'ring tide  But where's the man who counsel can bestow  Still pleas'd to teach and yet not proud to know  Unbiass'd or by favour or by spite  Not dully prepossess'd nor blindly right  Tho' learn'd wellbred and tho' wellbred sincere  Modestly bold and humanly severe  Who to a friend his faults can freely show  And gladly praise the merit of a foe  Blest with a taste exact yet unconfin'd  A knowledge both of books and human kind  Gen'rous converse a soul exempt from pride  And love to praise with reason on his side  Such once were Critics such the happy few  Athens and Rome in better ages knew  The mighty Stagirite first left the shore  Spread all his sails and durst the deeps explore  He steer'd securely and discover'd far  Led by the light of the Maeonian Star  Poets a race long unconfin'd and free  Still fond and proud of savage liberty  Receiv'd his laws and stood convinc'd 'twas fit  Who conquer'd Nature should preside o'er Wit  Horace still charms with graceful negligence  And without method talks us into sense  Will like a friend familiarly convey  The truest notions in the easiest way  He who supreme in judgment as in wit  Might boldly censure as he boldly writ  Yet judg'd with coolness tho' he sung with fire  His Precepts teach but what his works inspire  Our Critics take a contrary extreme  They judge with fury but they write with fle'me  Nor suffers Horace more in wrong Translations  By Wits than Critics in as wrong Quotations  See Dionysius Homer's thoughts refine  And call new beauties forth from ev'ry line  Fancy and art in gay Petronius please  The scholar's learning with the courtier's ease  In grave Quintilian's copious work we find  The justest rules and clearest method join'd  Thus useful arms in magazines we place  All rang'd in order and dispos'd with grace  But less to please the eye than arm the hand  Still fit for use and ready at command  Thee bold Longinus all the Nine inspire  And bless their Critic with a Poet's fire  An ardent Judge who zealous in his trust  With warmth gives sentence yet is always just  Whose own example strengthens all his laws  And is himself that great Sublime he draws  Thus long succeeding Critics justly reign'd  Licence repress'd and useful laws ordain'd  Learning and Rome alike in empire grew  And Arts still follow'd where her Eagles flew  From the same foes at last both felt their doom  And the same age saw Learning fall and Rome  With Tyranny then Superstition join'd  As that the body this enslav'd the mind  Much was believ'd but little understood  And to be dull was constru'd to be good  A second deluge Learning thus o'errun  And the Monks finish'd what the Goths begun  At length Erasmus that great injur'd name  The glory of the Priesthood and the shame  Stem'd the wild torrent of a barb'rous age  And drove those holy Vandals off the stage  But see each Muse in LEO's golden days  Starts from her trance and trim's her wither'd bays  Rome's ancient Genius o'er its ruins spread  Shakes off the dust and rears his rev'rend head  Then Sculpture and her sisterarts revive  Stones leap'd to form and rocks began to live  With sweeter notes each rising Temple rung  A Raphael painted and a Vida sung  Immortal Vida on whose honour'd brow  The Poet's bays and Critic's ivy grow  Cremona now shall ever boast thy name  As next in place to Mantua next in fame  But soon by impious arms from Latium chas'd  Their ancient bounds the banish'd Muses pass'd  Thence Arts o'er all the northern world advance  But Criticlearning flourish'd most in France  The rules a nation born to serve obeys  And Boileau still in right of Horace sways  But we brave Britons foreign laws despis'd  And kept unconquer'd and unciviliz'd  Fierce for the liberties of wit and bold  We still defy'd the Romans as of old  Yet some there were among the sounder few  Of those who less presum'd and better knew  Who durst assert the juster ancient cause  And here restor'd Wit's fundamental laws  Such was the Muse whose rules and practice tell  " Nature's chief Masterpiece is writing well"  Such was Roscommon not more learn'd than good  With manners gen'rous as his noble blood  To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known  And ev'ry author's merit but his own  Such late was Walshthe Muse's judge and friend  Who justly knew to blame or to commend  To failings mild but zealous for desert  The clearest head and the sincerest heart  This humble praise lamented shade receive  This praise at least a grateful Muse may give  The Muse whose early voice you taught to sing  Prescrib'd her heights and prun'd her tender wing  Her guide now lost no more attempts to rise  But in low numbers short excursions tries  Content if hence th' unlearn'd their wants may view  The learn'd reflect on what before they knew  Careless of censure nor too fond of fame  Still pleas'd to praise yet not afraid to blame  Averse alike to flatter or offend  Not free from faults nor yet too vain to mend  COMMENTARY  An Essay    The Poem is in one book but divided into three principals parts or members The first to ℣ gives rules for the  Study of the Art of Criticism  the second from thence to ℣ exposes the  Causes of wrong Judgment  and the third from thence to the end prescribes the  Morals of the Critic  In order to a right understanding of this poem it will be necessary to observe that tho' it be intitled simply  an Essay on Criticism  yet several of the precepts relate equally to the good  writing  as well as to the true  judging  of a poem This is so far from violating the  Unity  of the Subject that it rounds and compleats it or from disordering the regularity of the  Form  that it produces the highest beauty which can arise out of method as will appear by the following considerations It was impossible to give a full and exact idea of the  Art of poetical Criticism  without considering at the same time the  Art of Poetry  so far as Poetry is an  Art  These therefore being closely connected in nature the Author has with much judgment reciprocally  interwoven the precepts of both thro' his whole poem As all the rules of the ancient Critics were taken from Poets who copied nature this is another reason why every Poet should be a Critic Therefore as the subject is  poetical Criticism  it is frequently addressed to the  critical Poet  And dly the Art of Criticism is as necessarily and much more usefully exercised in  writing  than in  judging  But Readers have been misled by the modesty of the  Title  which only promises an Art of  Criticism  in a treatise and that a compleat one of the Art both of  Criticism  and  Poetry  This and the not attending to the considerations offered above perhaps was what misled a very candid writer after having given this Piece all the praises on the side of genius and poetry which his true taste could not resuse it to say that  the observations follow one another like those in  Horace's Art of Poetry  without that methodical regularity which would have been requisite in a prose writer  Spec No I do not see how  method  can hurt any one grace of Poetry or what prerogative there is in verse to to dispense with  regularity  The remark is false in every part of it Mr Pope's  Essay on Criticism  the Reader will soon see is a regular piece And a very learned Critic has lately shewn that  Horace  had the same attention to method in his  Art of Poetry  VER  'Tis hard to say etc    The Poem opens from ℣ to with shewing the use and seasonableness of the subject Its  use  from the greater mischief in wrong Criticism than in ill Poetry this only tiring that misleading the reader Its  seasonableness  from the growing number of false Critics which now vastly exceeds that of bad Poets  VER  'Tis with our judgments etc    The author having  shewn us the expediency of his subject the Art of  Criticism  next inquires from ℣ to into the necessary  Qualities  of a  true Critic  And observes first that JUDGMENT simply and alone is not sufficient to constitute this character because  Judgment  like the  artificial measures of Time  goes different and yet each relies upon his own The reason is conclusive and the similitude extremely just For  Judgment  when alone is always regulated or at least much inflenced by custom fashion and habit and never certain and constant but when sounded upon TASTE which is the same in the  Critic  as GENIUS in the  Poet  both are derived from Heaven and like the Sun the  natural measure of Time  always constant and equal  Nor need we wonder that Judgment alone will not make a Critic in poetry when we see that it will not make a Poet And on examination we shall find that  Genius  and  Taste  are but one and the same faculty differently exerting itself under different names in the two prosessions of  Poet  and  Critic  For the Art of Poetry consists in  selecting  out of all those images which present themselves to the fancy such of them as are truly poetical And the Art of Criticism in judiciously discerning and fully relishing what it finds so selected 'Tis the same operation of the mind in both cases and consequently exerted by the same faculty All the difference is that in the Poet this faculty is eminently joined with a  bright imagination  and  extensive comprehension  which provide stores for the selection and can form that selection by proportioned parts into a regular whole In the Critic with a  solid judgment  and  accurate discernment  which penetrate into the causes of an excellence and can shew that excellence in all its variety of lights  Longinus  had  taste  in an eminent degree so this which is indeed common to all true Critics our Author makes his distinguishing character  Thee bold Longinus all the Nine inspire  And bless their Critic with a Poet's fire  VER  Let such teach others etc    But it is not enough that the Critic hath these  natural endowments  to entitle him to the exercise of his Art he ought as our Author shews us from ℣ to to give a further test of his qualification by some  acquired talents  And this on two accounts Because the office of a Critic is an exercise of Authority Because he being naturally as partial to his  Judgment  as the Poet is to his  Wit  his partiality would have nothing to correct it as that of the person judged hath Therefore some test is reasonable and the best and most unexceptionable is his having written well himself an approved remedy against  Critical partiality  and the surest means of so maturing the Judgment as to reap with glory what  Longinus  calls  the last and most perfect fruits of much study and experience  Η ΓΑΡ ΤΩΝ ΛΟΓΩΝ ΚΡΙΣΙΣ ΠΟΛΛΗΣ ΕΣΤΙ ΠΕΙΡΑΣ ΤΕΛΕΥΤΑΙΟΝ ΕΠΙΓΕΝΝΗΜΑ  VER  Yet if we look etc    But having been so free with this fundamental quality of Criticism  Judgment  as to charge it with  inconstancy  and  partiality  and as often warped by  custom  and  affection  that this may not be mistaken he next explains from ℣ to the nature of  Judgment  and the accidents  occasioning those disorders before objected to it He owns that the  seeds  of  Judgment  are indeed sown in the minds of most men but by ill culture as it springs up it generally runs wild either on the one hand by  false knowledge  which pedants call  Philology  or by  false reasoning  which Philosophers call  Schoollearning  Or on the other by  false wit  which is not regulated by  sense  or by  false politeness  which is solely regulated by the  fashion  Both these sorts who have their Judgments thus doubly  depraved the poet observes are naturally turned to censure and reprehension only with this difference that the  Dunce  always affects to be on the  reasoning  and the  Fool  on the  laughing  sideAnd thus at the same time our author proves the truth of his introductory observation  that the number of bad Critics is vastly superior to that of bad Poets  VER  Some have at first for Wits etc    The poet having enumerated in this account of the nature of Judgment and its  various depravations the several sorts of  bad Critics  and ranked them into two general Classes as the first sort namely the men spoiled by  false learning  are but few in comparison of the other and likewise come less within his main view which is  poetical Criticism  but keep groveling at the bottom amongst  words  and  letters  he thought it here sufficient just to have mentioned them proposing to do them right elsewhere But the men spoiled by  false taste  are innumerable and These are his proper concern He therefore from ℣ to subdivides them again into the two classes of the  volatile  and  heavy  He describes in few words the quick progress of the One thro'  Criticism  from false wit to plain solly where they end and the fixed station of the Other between the confines of both who under the name of  Wit  ings  have neither end nor measure A kind of half formed creature from the equivocal generation of  vivacity  and  dulness  like those on the banks of  Nile  from  heat  and  mud  VER  But you who seek etc    Our author having thus far by way of INTRODUCTION explained the nature use and abuse of  Criticism  in a figurative description of the qualities and characters of  Critics  proceeds now to deliver the precepts of the Art The first of which from ℣ to is that he who sets up for a Critic should previously examine his own strength and see how far he is qualified for the exercise of his profession He puts him in a way to make this discovery in that admirable direction given ℣  AND MARK THAT POINT WHERE SENSE AND DULNESS MEET  He had shewn above that  Judgment  without  Taste  or  Genius  is equally incapable of making a Critic or a Poet In whatsoever subject then the Critic's  Taste  no longer accompanies his  Judgment  there he may be assured he is going out of his depth This our author finely calls  that point where sense and dulness meet  And immediately adds the REASON of his precept the Author of Nature having so constituted the mental faculties that one of them can never excel but at the expence of another  From this state and ordination of the mental faculties and the influence and effects they have one on another our Poet draws this CONSEQUENCE that no one genius can excell in more than one Art or Science The  consequence  shews the  necessity  of the precept just as the  premisses  from which it is drawn shew the  reasonableness  of it  VER  First follow Nature etc    The Critic observing the directions here given and finding himself qualified for his office is shewn next  how  to exercise it And as he was to attend to  Nature  for a  Call  so he is first and principally to follow her when  called  And here again in this as in the foregoing precept the poet from ℣ to shews both the  fitness  and the  necessity  of it It's  fitness  Because Nature is the  source  of poetic Art that Art being only a representation of Nature who is its great exemplar and original Because Nature is the  end  of Art the design of poetry being to convey the knowledge of  Nature in the most agreeable manner Because Nature is the  test  of Art as she is unerring constant and still the same Hence the poet observes that as Nature is the  source  she conveys  life  to Art As she is the  end  she conveys  force  to it for the  force  of any thing arises from its being directed to its  end  And as she is the  test  she conveys  beauty  to it for every thing acquires  beauty  by its being reduced to its true  standard  Such is the sense of those two important lines  Life force  and  beauty  must to all impart  At once the  source  and  end  and  test  of Art  We now come to the  necessity  of the Precept The two great constituent qualities of a  Composition  as such are  Art  and  Wit  But neither of these attains perfection 'till the first be  hid  and the other judiciously  restrained  which is only then when  Nature  is exactly followed for then Art never makes a parade nor can Wit commit an extravagance Art while it  adheres  to Nature and has so large a  fund  in the resources which Nature supplies disposes every thing with so much  ease  and  simplicity  that we see nothing but those natural images it works with while itself stands unobserv'd behind But when Art  leaves  Nature deluded either by the bold extravagance of Fancy or the quaint odnesses of Fashion she is then obliged at every step to come forward in a painful or pompous ostentation in order to cover to soften or to regulate the shocking disproportion of  unnatural  images In the  first  case the poet compares Art to the Soul within informing a beauteous Body but we generally find it in the  last  only like the outward Habit bolstering up by the Taylor's skill the defects of a misshapen oneAs to  Wit  it might perhaps be imagined that this needed only  Judgment  to govern it But as he well observes  Wit  and  Judgment  often are at strife  Tho' meant each other's aid like Man and Wife  They want therefore some friendly Mediator or Reconciler which is  Nature  And in attending to her the Judgment will learn where to comply with the charms of Wit and the Wit how to obey the sage directions of Judgment  VER  Those Rules of old etc    Having thus in his first precept  to follow Nature  settled Criticism on its true bottom he proceeds to shew what assistance may be had from  Art  But  lest this should be thought to draw the Critic from the foundation where he had before fixed him he previously observes from ℣ to that those  Rules of Art  which he is now about to recommend to his study were not invented by the Imagination but discovered in the book of Nature And that therefore tho' they may seem to restrain  Nature  by  Laws  yet as they are laws of her own making the Critic is still properly in the very liberty of Nature Those Rules the ancient Critics borrowed from the Poets who received them immediately from  Nature  Just Precepts thus srom great Examples giv'n  These drew from them what they deriv'd from Heav'n  and are both therefore to be well studied  VER  Hear how learn'd Greece etc    He speaks of the  ancient Critics  first and with great judgment as the previous knowledge of them is necessary for reading the Poets with that fruit which the intent here proposed requires But having in the previous observation sufficiently explained the  nature  of ancient Criticism he enters on the subject treated of from ℣ to with a sublime description of its  End  which was to  illustrate the beauties of the best Writers in order to excite others to an emulation of their excellence From the admiration which these Ideas raise in him the poet is naturally brought back to reflect on the degeneracy of modern Criticism And as the restoring the Art to its original integrity and splendor is the great purpose of his poem he first takes notice of those who seem not to understand that  Nature  is exhaustless that  new models  of good writing may be produced in every age and consequently  new rules  may be formed from these models in the same manner as the old Critics formed theirs from the writings of the ancient Poets but these men wanting art and ability to form these  new rules  are content to receive and file up for use the  old ones  of  Aristotle Quintilian Longinus Horace etc  with the same vanity and boldness that Apothecaries practise with their Doctors bills And thus rashly applying them to  new Originals  cases which they did not hit it was no more in their power than their inclination to imitate the candid practice of the  Ancients  when  The gen'rous Critic fann'd the Poet's fire  And taught the world with reason to admire  For as  Ignorance  when joined with  Humility  produces stupid admiration on which account it is so commonly observed to be the  mother of Devotion  and blind homage so when joined with  Vanity  as it always is in bad Critics it gives birth to every iniquity of impudent abuse and slander See an example for want of a better in a late worthless and now forgotten thing called the  Life of Socrates  Where the head of the Author as a man of wit observed on reading the book has just made a shift to do the office of a  Camera obscura  and represent things in an inverted order himself  above  and Sprat Rollin Voltaire and every other Author of reputation  below  VER  You then whose judgment etc    He comes next to the  ancient Poets  the other and more intimate commentators of Nature And shews from ℣ to that the study of These must indispensably follow that of the  ancient Critics  as they furnish us with what the Critics who only give us  general rules  cannot supply while the study of a great original Poet in  His Fable Subject scope in ev'ry page  Religion Country genius of his Age  will help us to those  particular rules  which only can conduct us  safely through every considerable work we undertake to examine and without which we may cavil indeed as the poet truly observes but can never  criticize  We might as well suppose that Vitruvius's book alone would make a perfect Judge of Architecture without the knowledge of some great masterpiece of science such as the Rotonda at Rome or the Temple of Minerva at Athens as that Aristotle's should make a  perfect Judge of wit  without the study of Homer and Virgil These therefore he principally recommends to complete the Critic in his Art But as the latter of these Poets has by superficial judges been considered rather as a copyer of Homer than an original our Author obviates that common error and shews it to have arisen as often error does from a truth  viz  that  Homer and Nature were the same  and how that the ambitious young Poet though he scorned to stoop at any thing short of Nature when he came to understand this great truth had the prudence to contemplate Nature in the place where she was seen to most advantage collected in all her charms in the clear mirror of Homer Hence it would follow that though Virgil studied Nature  yet the  vulgar  reader would believe him to be a copier of Homer and though he copied Homer yet the  judicious  reader would see him to be an imitator of Nature the finest praise which any one who came after Homer could receive  VER  Some beauties yet no Precepts can declare etc    Our Author in these two general precepts for studying  Nature  and her  Commentators  having considered Poetry as it  is  or  may be  reduced to  Rule  lest this should be mistaken as sufficient to attain PERFECTION either in  writing  or  judging  he proceeds from ℣ to to point up to those  sublimer beauties  which  Rules  will never reach that is enable us either to  execute  or  taste  and which rise so high above all precept as not even to be  described  by it but being entirely the gift of Heaven Art and Reason have no further share in their production than just to moderate their operations These  Sublimities  of Poetry like the  Mysteries  of Religion some of which are above Reason and some contrary to it may be divided into  two sorts  such as are  above  Rules and such as are  contrary  to them  VER  If where the rules etc    The  first  sort our author  describes from ℣ to and shews that where a great beauty is in the  Poet's  view which no stated  Rules  will direct him how to reach there as the purpose of rules is only to promote an end like this a lucky  Licence  will supply the want of them nor can the  Critic  fairly object to it since this  Licence  for the reason given above has the proper sorce and authority of a  Rule  VER  Great Wits sometimes may gloriously offend etc    He describes next the  second sort  the beauties  against rule  And even here as he observes from ℣ to the offense is so glorious and the fault so sublime that the  true Critic  will not dare either to censure or reform them Yet still the  Poet  is never to abandon himself to his Imagination the rules our author lays down for his conduct in this respect are these That though he transgress the  letter  of some  one particular  precept yet that he still adhere to the end or  spirit  of them  all  which end is the creation of  one uniform perfect Whole  And That he have in each instance the authority of the  dispensing  power of the Ancients to plead for him These rules observed this licence will be  seldom  used and only when he is  compelled by need  which will disarm the Critic and screen the transgressor from his laws  VER  I know there are etc    But as some  modern Critics  have had the presumption to say that this last rule is only justifying one fault by another our author goes on from ℣ to to vindicate the  Ancients  and to shew that this censure proceeds from rank Ignorance As where their  partial  Judgment cannot see that this licence is sometimes necessary for the symmetry and proportion of a perfect whole from the point and in the light wherein it must be viewed or where their  hasty  Judgment will not give them time to discover that a deviation from rule is for the sake of attaining some great and admirable purposeThese observations are further useful as they tend to give modern Critics an humbler opinion of their own abilities and an higher of the Authors they undertake to criticize On which account He concludes with a fine reproof of that common  proverb  perpetually in the mouths of Critics  quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus  misunderstanding the sense of Horace and taking  quandoque  for  aliquando  Those oft are stratagems which errors seem  Nor is it  Homer nods  but we that dream  VER  Still green with bays etc    But now fired with the name of  Homer  and transported with the contemplation of those beauties which a cold Critic can neither see nor conceive the Poet from ℣ to breaks into a rapturous exclamation on the rare felicity of those few Ancients who have risen superior over time and accidents And as it were disdaining any longer to  reason  with his Critics offers this to them as the surest confutation of their censures Then with the  humility  of a supplicant at the shrine of Immortals and the  Sublimity  of a Poet participating of their fire he turns again to these ancient worthies and apostrophises their Manes  Hail Bards triumphant etc  VER  T' admire superior sense  and  doubt their own    This line concludes the first division of the Poem in which we  see the  subject  of the first and second part and likewise the connexion they have with one another It serves likewise to introduce the second The effect of studying the  Ancients  as hitherto recommended would be the  admiration of their superior sense  which if it will not of itself dispose  Moderns  to a  diffidence of their own  one of the great uses as well as natural fruits of that study the poet to help forward their modesty in his second part shews them in a regular deduction of the  causes and effects of wrong Judgment  their own image and amiable turn of mind  VER  Of all the Causes etc    Having in the first part delivered  Rules  for  perfecting the Art of Criticism  the second is employ'd in explaining the  Impediments  to it The order of the two parts is judicious For the causes of wrong Judgment being  Pride superficial Learning a bounded Capacity  and  Partiality  Those to whom this part is principally addressed would not readily be brought either to see the malignity of the  causes  or to own themselves concerned in the  effects  had not the Author previously both enlightened and convicted them by the foregoing observations on the  vastness of Art  and  narrowness of Wit  the extensive  study of human Nature and Antiquity  and the  Characters of ancient Poetry and Criticism  the natural remedies to the four epidemic disorders he is now endeavouring to redress  Ibid  Of all the causes etc    The first cause of wrong Judgment is PRIDE He judiciously begins with it from ℣ to as on other accounts so on this that it is the very thing which gives modern Criticism its character whose complexion is  abuse  and  censure  He calls it the vice of  Fools  by whom are not meant those to whom Nature has given no Judgment for he is here speaking of what misleads the Judgment but those in whom education and study has made no improvement as appears from the happy similitude of an  illnourish'd  body  where the same words which express the  cause  expres likewise the  nature  of pride  For as in bodies thus in souls we find  What wants in blood and spirits swell'd with wind  'Tis the business of reason he tells us to dispel the  cloud  which pride throws over the mind But the mischief is that the rays of reason diverted by selflove sometimes  gild  this  cloud  instead of  dissipating  it So that the Judgment by false lights reflected back upon itself is still apt to be a little dazzled and to mistake its object He therefore advises to call in still more helps  Trust not yourself  but your defects to know  Make use of ev'ry Friend  and ev'ry Foe  Both the  beginning  and  conclusion  of this precept are remarkable The question is of the means to subdue Pride He directs the Critic to begin with a  distrust of himself  and this is  Modesty  the  first  mortification of Pride And then to seek the assistance of others and  make use even of an Enemy  and this is  Humility  the  last  mortification of Pride For when a man can once bring himself to submit to profit by an enemy he has either already quite subdued his Vanity or is in a fair way of so doing  VER  A little learning etc    We must here remark the Poet's skill in his disposition of the  causes  obstructing true Judgment Each  general cause  which is laid down first has its own  particular cause  in that which follows Thus the  second  cause of wrong Judgment SUPERFICIAL LEARNING is what gives birth to that critical  Pride  which he mentioned first  VER  Drink deep etc    Nature  and  Learning  are the pole stars of all true Criticism But  Pride  hinders the sight of Nature and a  smattering of letters  takes away all sense of the want of Learning To avoid this ridiculous situation the poet from ℣ to advises either to drink deep or not to taste at all for the least sip is enough to make a bad Critic while even a moderate draught can never make a good one And yet the labours and difficulties of  drinking deep  are so great that a young author  "Fir'd with ideas of fair Italy"  and ambitious to snatch a palm from Rome engages in an undertaking as arduous almost as that of Hannibal Finely illustrated by the similitude of an unexperienced traveller penetrating thro' the Alps  VER  A perfect Judge etc    The third cause of wrong Judgment is a NARROW CAPACITY the natural and certain  cause  of the foregoing defect  acquiescence in superficial learning  This  bounded Capacity  the poet shews from to betrays itself two ways in the  matter  and in the  manner  of the  work criticised In the matter by judging  by parts  or by having one  favorite part  to a neglect of all the rest In the manner by confining the regard only to  conceit  or  language  or  numbers  This is our Poet's order and we shall follow him as it leads us only just observing one great beauty which runs thro' this part of the poem it is that under each of these heads of  wrong  Judgment he has intermixed excellent precepts for  right  We shall take notice of them as they occur  He exposes the folly of judging by parts very artfully not by a direct description of that sort of Critic but of his opposite  a perfect Judge etc  Nor is the elegance of this conversion inferior to the art of it for as in  poetic style  one word or figure is still put for another in order to catch new lights from different images and to reflect them back upon the subject in hand so in  poetic matter  one person or thing may be advantageously employed for another with the same elegance of representation It is observable that our Author makes it almost the necessary consequence of judging  by parts  to find fault And this not without much discernment For the several  parts  of a compleat  Whole  when  seen only singly  and  known only independently  must always have the appearance of irregularity often of deformity Because the Poet's design being to  create  a resultive beauty from the artful assemblage of several various  parts  into one natural  whole  those parts must be fashioned with regard to their mutual relations in the stations they occupy in that whole from whence the beauty required is to arise But that  regard  will occasion so unreducible a form in each part when  considered singly  as to present a very misshapen appearance  VER  Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see    He shews next from ℣ to that to fix our censure on  single parts  tho' they happen to  want  an exactness consistent enough with their relation to the rest is even then very unjust And for these reasons Because it implies an expectation of a  faultless piece  which is a vain imagination Because no more is to be expected of any work than that it fairly  attains its end  But the end may be attained and yet these trivial faults committed Therefore in spight of such faults the work will merit the praise due to that which attains its end Because sometimes a great beauty is not to be procured nor a notorious blemish to be avoided but by suffering one of these minute and trivial errors And laftly because the generous  neglect  of them is a  praise  as it is the indication of a  Genius  busied about greater matters  VER  Most Critics fond of some subservient art etc    II The  second  way in which a  narrow capacity  as it relates to the  matter  shews itself is judging by a  favorite Part  The author has placed this from ℣ to after the other of judging  by parts  with great propriety it being indeed a natural consequence of it For when men have once left the  whole  to turn their attention to the  separate parts  that regard and reverence due only to a  whole  is fondly transferred to one or other of its  parts  And thus we see that Heroes themselves as well as Heromakers even  Kings  as well as Poets and Critics when they chance never to have had or long to have lost the idea of that which is the only legitimate object of their office the care and conservation of the  whole  are wont to devote themselves to the service of some favorite part whether it be love of money military glory despotic power etc  And all  as our Author says on this occasion  to one lov'd Folly sacrifice  This general misconduct much recommends that maxim in good Poetry and Politics  to give a principal attention to the whole  a maxim which our author has elswhere shewn to be equally true likewise in  Morals  and  Religion  as being founded in the order of things For if we examine we shall find it arise from this imbecillity of our nature that the mind must always have something  to rest upon  to which the passions and affections may be interestingly directed Nature prompts us to seek it in the most worthy object and common sense points out to a  Whole  or  System  But Ignorance and the false lights of the Passions confound and dazzle us we stop short and before we get to a  Whole  take up with some  Part  which from thence becomes our Favourite  VER  Thus Critics of less judgment than caprice  Curious  not  knowing  not  exact  but  nice  Form short Ideas etc    He concludes his observations on those  two sorts  of judges  by parts  with this general reflexionThe  curious not knowing  are the  first  sort who judge  by parts  and with a  microscopic  sight as he says elsewhere  examine bit by bit  The  not exact but nice  are the  second  who judge by a  favourite part  and talk of a  whole  to cover their sondness for a  part  as Philosophers do of  principles  in order to obtrude their  notions  or opinions for them  But the fate common to both is to be governed by  caprice  and not by  Judgment  and consequently  to form short ideas  or to have ideas short of truth Tho' the latter sort thro' a fondness to their  favorite part  imagine that they comprehend the  whole  in epitome As the famous Hero of  La Mancha  mentioned just before used to maintain that  Knight Errantry  comprised within itself the quintessence of all Science civil and military  VER  Some to Conceit alone etc    We come now to that second sort of  bounded capacity  which betrays itself in the  manner  of the work criticised And this our Author prosecutes from ℣ to These are again subdivided into divers classes  Ibid  Some to Conceit alone etc    The  first  from ℣ to are those who confine their attention solely to  Conceit  or  Wit  And here again the Critic  by parts  offends  doubly  in the  manner  just as he did in the  matter  For he not only confines his attention  to a  part  when it should be extended to the  whole  but he likewise judges  salsely  of that  part  And this like the other is unavoidable as the  parts  in the  manner  bear the same close relation to the  whole  that the  parts  in the  matter  do to which  whole  the ideas of this Critic have never yet extended Hence it is that our author speaking here of those who confine their attention solely to  Conceit  or  Wit  describes the two species of  true  and  false  Wit because they not only mistake  a wrong disposition of true Wit for a right  but likewise  false Wit for true  He describes false Wit first from ℣ to  Some to Conceit alone etc  Where the reader may observe our Author's skill in representing in a description of  salse  Wit the false disposition of the  true  as the Critic  by parts  is apt to fall into both these errors  He next describes  true Wit  from to  True Wit is Nature to advantage dress'd etc  And here again the reader may observe the same beauty not only an explanation of  true Wit  but likewise of the  right disposition  of it which the poet illustrates as he did the  wrong  by ideas taken from the art of Painting  VER  Others for Language etc    He proceeds secondly to those narrowminded Critics whose whole concern turns upon  Language  and shews from ℣ to that this quality where it holds the principal place  deserves no commendation  Because it excludes qualities more essential And when the abounding Verbiage has excluded the sense the writer has nothing to do but to gild over the defect by giving his words all the false colouring in his power  He shews that the Critic who busies himself with this quality alone is altogether  unable to make a right Judgment  of it because  true Expression  is only the dress of Thought and so must be perpetually varied according to the subject and manner  of thinking But those who never concern themselves with the  Sense  can form no judgment of the correspondence between  that  and the  Language  Expression is the dress of thought and still  Appears more decent as more suitable etc  Now as these Critics are ignorant of this correspondence their whole judgment in Language is reduced to the examination of  single words  of which such as are to his taste are so only in proportion as they smack of Antiquity On which our author has therefore bestowed a little raillery concluding with a short and proper direction concerning the  use of words  so far as regards their  novelty  and  ancientry  VER  But most by  Numbers  judge etc    The last sort are those from ℣ to whose ears are attached only to the  Harmony  of a poem Of which they judge as ignorantly and as perversely as the other sort did of  Eloquence  and for the very same reason He  first  describes that  false Harmony  with which they are so much captivated and shews that it is wretchedly  flat  and  unvaried  For  Smooth or rough with them is right or wrong  He then describes the  true  As it is in  itself constant  with a happy mixture of  strength  and  sweetness  in contradiction to the  roughness  and  flatness  of false Harmony And as it is  varied  in compliance to the  subject  where the  sound becomes an who to the sense  so far as is consistent with the preservation of numbers in contradiction to the  monotony  of false Harmony Of this he gives us in the delivery of his precepts four fine examples of  smoothness roughness slowness  and  rapidity  The  first  use of this correspondence of the  sound  to the  sense  is to aid the fancy in acquiring a perfecter and more lively image of the thing represented A  second  and nobler is to calm and subdue the turbulent and selfish passions and to raise and warm the beneficent Which he illustrates in the famous adventure of  Timotheus  and  Alexander  where in referring to Mr  Dryden's  Ode on that subject he turns it to a high compliment on that great poet  VER  Avoid  Extremes  etc    Our Author is now come to the  last cause of wrong judgment  PARTIALITY the parent of the immediately preceding cause a  bounded capacity  Nothing so much narrowing and contracting the mind as  prejudices  entertained for or against things or persons This therefore as the main root of all the foregoing he prosecutes at large from ℣ to  First to ℣ he  previously  exposes that capricious turn of mind which by running men into  Extremes  either of praise or dispraise lays the  foundation  of an  habitual partiality  He cautions therefore both against one and the other and shews that excess of  Praise  is the mark of a  bad taste  and excess of  Censure  of a  bad digestion  VER  Some foreign writers etc    Having explained the disposition of mind which produces an  habitual partiality  be preceeds to expose this  partiality  in all the shapes in which it appeats both amongst the  unlearned  and the  learned  I In the  unlearned  it is seen  first  In an unreasonable fondness for or aversion to our  own  or  foreign  to  ancient  or  modern  writers And as it is the  mob  of unlearned readers he is here speaking of he exposes their solly in a very apposite similitude  Thus Wit like Faith by each Man is apply'd  To one small sect and all are damn'd beside  But he shews from ℣ to that these Critics have as wrong a notion of  Reason  as those Bigots have of  God  For that Genius is not confined to times or climates but as the common gist of Nature is extended throughout all ages and countries That indeed this intellectual light like the material light of the Sun itself may not shine at all times in every place with equal splendor but be sometimes  clouded  with  popular ignorance  and sometimes again  eclipsed  by the discountenance of  Princes  yet it shall still recover itself and by breaking thro' the strongest of these impediments manifest the eternity of its nature  VER  Some ne'er advance a Judgment of their own    A  second  instance of  unlearned partiality  he shews from ℣ to is mens going always along with the  cry  as having no fixed or well grounded principles whereon to raise any judgment of their own A  third  is reverence for  names  of which sort as he well observes the worst and vilest are the idolizers of  names of quality  whom therefore he stigmatizes as they deserve Our  author's temper as well as judgment is here very observable in throwing this species of partiality amongst the  unlearned  Critics His affection for letters would not suffer him to conceive that any  learned  Critic could ever fall to so low a prostitution  VER  The Vulgar thus  As oft the Learn'd    II He comes in the  second place  from ℣ to to consider the instances of  partiality  in the  learned  The  first  is  Singularity  For as want of principles in the  unlearned  necessitates them to rest on the general judgment as  always right  so adherence to false principles that is to  notions of their own  misleads the  learned  into the other extreme of supposing the general  judgment  always wrong  And as before the Poet compared  those  to  Bigots  who made true faith to consist in believing after others so he compares  these  to  Schismaticks  who make it to consist in believing as no one ever believed before Which folly he marks with a lively stroke of humour in the  turn  of the thought  So Schismatics the plain believers quit  And are but damn'd  for having too much Wit  The  second  is  Novelty  And as this proceeds sometimes from  fondness  sometimes from  vanity  he compares the  one  to the  passion for a mistress  and the  other  to the  pride of being in fashion  But the excuse common to both is the  daily improvement of their Judgment  Ask them the cause they're wiser still they say  Now as this is a plausible pretence for their inconstancy and our author has himself afterwards laid down the like thought in a  precept  for a remedy against obstinacy and pride where he says ℣  But you with pleasure own your errors past  And  make each day a critic on the last  he has been careful by the turn of the expression in this place to shew the difference For  Time  considered only as  duration  vitiates as frequently as it improves Therefore to expect wisdom as the necessary attendant of  length of years  unrelated to  long experience  is vain and delusive This he illustrates by a remarkable example where we see  Time  instead of becoming  wiser  destroying  good letters  to substitute  school divinity  in their placeThe  genius  of which kind of learning the  character  of its professors and the  sate  which sooner or later always attends whatsoever is wrong or false the poet sums up in those four lines  Faith Gospel all seem'd made to be disputed etc  And in conclusion he observes that perhaps this mischief from love of  novelty  might not be so great did it not with the  Critic  infect  Writers  likewise who when they find their readers disposed to take  ready Wit  on the standard of  current Folly  never trouble themselves to make better payment  VER  Some valuing those of their own side or mind etc    The  third  and last instance of  partiality  in the  learned  is  Party  and  Faction  Which is consider'd from ℣ to where he shews how men of this turn deceive themselves when they load a writer of their own side with commendation They fancy they are paying tribute to  merit  when they are only sacrificing to  selflove  But this is not the worst He further shews that this  party spirit  has often very ill effects on Science  itself while in support of  Faction  it labours to depress some rising Genius that was perhaps raised by nature to enlighten his age and country By which he would insinuate that all the base and viler passions seek refuge and find support in  party madness  VER  Be thou the first etc    The poet having now gone thro' the last cause of  wrong Judgment  and root of all the rest PARTIALITY and ended it with the highest instances of it in  partyrage  and  envy  this affords him an opportunity from ℣ to of closing his  second division  in the most graceful manner by concluding from the premisses and calling upon the TRUE CRITIC to be careful of his  charge  which is the  protection  and  support  of  Wit  For the defence of it from malevolent censure is its true protection and the illustration of its beauties its true support  He first shews the Critic ought to do this service without delay And on these motives  Out of regard to himself  For there is  some  merit in giving the world notice of an excellence but  none at all  in pointing like an Idiot to that which has been long in the admiration of men  Out of regard to the Poem  For the short duration of modern works requires they should begin  to  enjoy their existence  early He compares the life of  modern Wit  and of the  ancient  which survives in an universal language to the difference between the Patriarchal age and our own And observes that while the ancient writings live for ever as it were in brass and marble the modern are but like  Paintings  which of how masterly a hand soever have no sooner gained their requisite perfection by the incorporating softening and ripening of their tints which they do in a very few years but they begin to fade and die away Lastly our author shews that the Critic ought to do this service  out of regard to the Poet  when he considers the slender dowry the Muse brings along with her In  youth  'tis only a short lived vanity and in  maturer years  an accession of care and labour in proportion to the weight of Reputation to be sustained and of the increase of Envy to be opposed And concludes his reasoning therefore on this head with that pathetic and insinuating address to the Critic from to  Ah let not learning etc  VER  But if in noble minds some dregs remain etc    So far as to what ought to be the  true Critic's  principal study and employment But if the four critical humour must needs have vent he points to its right object and shews from ℣ to how it may be usefully and innocently diverted This is very observable for our author makes spleen and disdain the characteristic of the  false Critic  and yet here supposes them inherent in the  true  But it is done with judgment and a knowledge of nature For as bitterness and acerbity in unripe fruits of the best kind are the foundation and capacity of that high spirit race and flavour which we find in them when perfectly concocted by the heat and influence of the Sun and which without those qualities would often gain no more by that influence than only a  mellow insipidity  so spleen and disdain in the true Critic improved by long study and experience ripen into an exactness of Judgment and an elegance of Taste But lying in the false Critic remote from  the influence of good letters continue in all their first offensive harshness and astringency The Poet therefore shews how after the exaltation of these qualities into their state of perfection the very  Dregs  which tho' precipitated may possibly on some occasions rise and ferment even in a  noble mind  may be usefully employed in branding OBSCENITY and IMPIETY Of these he explains the rise and progress in a beautiful picture of the different genius's of the reigns of  Charles  II and  William  III the former of which gave course to the most  profligate luxury  the latter to a  licentious impiety  These are the criminals the poet assigns over to the caustic hand of the Critic but concludes however from ℣ to with this necessary admonition to take care not to be misled into unjust censure either on the one hand by a pharisaical  niceness  or on the other by a consciousness of guilt And thus the  second division  of his Essay ends The judicious conduct of  which  is worthy our observation The subject of it are the  causes of wrong Judgment  These he derives upwards from  cause  to  cause  till he brings them to their source an  immoral partiality  For as he had in the first part  trac'd the Muses upward to their spring  and shewn them to be derived from Heaven and the Offspring of virtue so hath he  here  pursued this enemy of the Muses the  bad Critic  to his low original in the arms of his nursing mother  Immorality  This order naturally  introduces  and at the same time shews the  necessity  of the subject of the third and last division which is on the  Morals of the Critic  VER  Learn then etc    We enter now on the  third part  the MORALS of the  Critic  included in CANDOUR MODESTY and GOODBREEDING This third and last part is in two divisions In the  first  of which from ℣ to he inculcates these  morals  by  precept  In the  second  from ℣ to the end by  example  His  first  precept from ℣ to recommends CANDOUR for its  use to the Critic  and to the  writer criticised  The  second  from ℣ to recommends MODESTY which manifests itself by these four  signs  Silence where it doubts  Be silent always when you doubt your sense  A seeming diffidence where it knows  And speak tho' sure with seeming diffidence  A free confession of error where wrong  But you with pleasure own your errors past  And a constant review and scrutiny even of those opinions which it still thinks right  And make each day a Critic on the last  The  third  from ℣ to recommends GOOD BREEDING which will not force truth dogmatically upon men as  ignorant  of it but gently insinuates it into them as not  sufficiently attentive  to it But as  men of breeding  are apt to fall into two  extremes  he prudently cautions against them The one is a  backwardness in communicating  their knowledge out of a false delicacy and fear of being thought  Pedants  The other and much more common extreme in  men of breeding  is a  mean complacence  which such as are worthy of your advice do not want to make it acceptable for those can best bear reproof in particular points who best deserve commendation in general  VER  'Twere well might Critics etc    The poet having thus recommended in these  general rules of Conduct  for the  Judgment  the  three critical Virtues  to the  heart  shews next from ℣ to on what three sort of Writers these Virtues together with the advice conveyed under them would be thrown away and which is worse be repaid with obloquy and slander These are the  false Critic  the  dull Man of Quality  and the  bad Poet  each of which  incorrigible  writers he hath very justly and exactly characterized  But having drawn the last of them at large and being always attentive to his main subject which is  of writing  and  judging well  he reassumes the character of the  bad Critic  whom he had but touched upon before to contrast him with the other and makes the  Characteristic  common to both to be a neverceasing  Repetition  of their own impertinence  The  Poet    still runs on in a raging vein etc  ℣  etc  The  Critic    with his own tongue still edifies his ears  ℣  etc  VER  But where's the man etc    II The  second  division of this last part which we now come to is of the Morals of Critics by  example  For having there drawn a picture of the  false Critic  at large he breaks out into an apostrophe containing an exact and finished character of the  true  which at the same time serves for an easy and proper introduction to  this second division  For having asked from ℣ to  Where's the  man etc  he answers from ℣ to That he was to be found in the happier ages of  Greece  and  Rome  in the persons of  Aristotle  and  Horace Dionysius  and  Petronius Quintilian  and  Longinus  Whose features he has not only exactly delineated but contrasted with a peculiar elegance the profound science and  logical method  of  Aristotle  being opposed to the plain  common sense  of  Horace  conveyed in a natural and familiar  negligence  the  study  and  refinement  of  Dionysius  to the  gay  and  courtly ease  of  Petronius  and the  gravity  and  minuteness  of  Quintilian  to the  vivacity  and  general topics  of  Longinus  Nor has the Poet been less careful in these  examples  to point out their eminence in the several  critical Virtues  he so carefully inculcated in his  precepts  Thus in  Horace  he particularizes his  Candour  in  Petronius  his  Good Breeding  in  Quintilian  his  free  and  copious Instruction  and in  Longinus  his  noble Spirit  VER  Thus long succeeding Critics etc    The  next period  in which the true Critic he tells us appear'd was at the revival and restoration of letters in the West This occasions his giving a short history from ℣ to of the decline  and reestablishment of arts and sciences in  Italy  He shews that they both fell under the same enemy  despotic power  and that when both had made some little efforts to restore themselves they were soon quite overwhelmed by a  second deluge  of another kind  Superstition  and a calm of Dulness finish'd upon  Rome  and Letters what the rage of Barbarism had begun  A  second deluge  learning thus o'errun  And the  Monk  finish'd what the  Goth  begun  When things had been long in this condition and all recovery now appear'd desperate it was a CRITIC our author shews us for the honour of the  Art  he here teaches who at length broke the charm of Dulness dissipated the inchantment and like another  Hercules  drove those cowl'd and  hooded serpents  from the  Hesperian  tree of knowledge which they had so long guarded from human approach  VER  At length  Erasmus  etc    Nothing can be more artful than the application of this  example  or more happy than the turn of compliment to this admirable man To throw glory quite round his illustrious character he makes it to be as in fact it really was by his assistance chiefly that  Leo  was enabled to restore letters and the fine arts in his Pontificate  VER  But see each Muse in Leo's golden days    This presents us with the  second period  in which the  true Critic  appear'd of whom he has given us a perfect  idea  in the single example of  Marcus Hieronymus Vida  For his  subject  being  poetical Criticism  for the use principally of a  critical Poet  his  example  is an eminent  poetical Critic  who had had written of that Art in verse  VER  But soon by  impious arms  etc    This brings us to the  third period  after learning had still travelled farther West when the arms of the  Emperor  in the sack of Rome by the duke of  Bourbon  had driven it out of  Italy  and forced it to pass the  Mountains  The Examples he gives in this period are of  Boileau  in  France  and of the Lord  Roscommon  and the duke of  Buckingham  in  England  And these were all Poets as well as Critics in verse It is true the last instance is of one who was no eminent poet the late Mr  Walsh  This small deviation might be well overlooked was it only for its being a pious office to the memory of his friend But it may be farther justified as it was an homage paid in particular to the MORALS of the Critic nothing being more amiable than the character here drawn of this excellent person He being our Author's Judge and Censor as  well as Friend it gives him a graceful opportunity to add  himself  to the number of the later Critics and with a  character of himself  sustained by that  modesty  and  dignity  which it is so difficult to make consistent this performance concludes  I have given a short and plain account of the  Essay on Criticism  concerning which I have but one thing more to acquaint the reader That when he considers the Regularity of the plan the masterly Conduct of each part the penetration into Nature and the compass of Learning so conspicuous throughout he should at the same time know it was the work of an Author who had not attained the twentieth year of his age  NOTES  VER  Let such teach

 loss of common sense  For  wit  consisting in chusing out and setting together such ideas from whose likenesses pleasant pictures are made in the fancy the  Judgment  thro' an  habitual  search of Wit loses by degrees its faculty of seeing the true relations of things in which consists the exercise of  common sense  VER  All fools have still an itching to deride  And fain would be upon the

Idiots and naturalfools who are always on the grin  VER  Their generation's so  equivocal  It is sufficient that a principle of philosophy has been generally received whether it be true or false to justify a poet's use of it to set off his  wit  But to recommend his  argument  he should be cautious how he uses any but the true For falsehood when it is set too near will tarnish the truth he would recommend Besides the analogy between natural and moral truth makes the principles of true Philosophy the fittest for his use Our Poet has been careful in observing this rule  VER  And mark that point where sense and dullness meet    Besides the  peculiar  sense explained above in the comment the words have still a more  general  meaning and caution us against going on when our Ideas begin to grow obscure as we are  apt to do tho' that obscurity is a monition that we should leave off for it arises either thro' our small acquaintance with the subject or the incomprehensibility of its nature In which circumstances a genius will always write as heavily as a dunce An observation well worth the attention of all profound writers  VER  Thus in the soul while memory prevails  The solid pow'r of understanding fails  Where beams of  warm  imagination play  The memory's soft sigures melt away    These observations are collected from an intimate knowledge of human nature The cause of that languor and heaviness in the  understanding  which is almost inseparable from a very strong and tenacious  memory  seems to be a want of the proper exercise and activity of that power the understanding being rather passive while the memory is cultivating As to the other appearance  the decay of memory by the vigorous exercise of Fancy the poet himself seems to have intimated the cause of it in the epithet he has given to the Imagination For if according to the Atomic Philosophy the memory of things be preserved in a chain of ideas produced by the animal spirits moving in continued trains the force and rapidity of the Imagination perpetually breaking and dissipating the links of this chain by forming new associations must necessarily weaken and disorder the recollective faculty  VER  Would all but stoop to what they understand    The expression is delicate and implies what is very true that most men think it a degradation of their genius to employ it in cultivating what lies

separately constitute the distinct value of those two species of foreign Criticism make no part of the character of these paltry mimics at home described by our Poet in the following lines  These  leave the sense their learning to display  And  those  explain the meaning quite away  Which species is the least hurtful the Poet has enabled us to determine in the lines with which he opens his poem

meant that it could not stand the test of Judgment but that it being a beauty uncommon and  above rule  and the Judgment habituated to determine only  by rule  it makes its direct application to the Heart which once gained soon opens and enlarges the Judgment whose concurrence it being now set above forms is easily procured That this is the poet's sublime conception appears from the concluding words  and all its end at once attains  For Poetry doth not attain  all its end  till it hath gained the  Judgment  as well as  Heart  VER  A prudent chief etc      Dion Hal De struct orat  VER  Nor

the four great causes of the ravage amongst ancient writings The destruction of the Alexandrine and Palatine libraries by  fire  the fiercer rage of  Zoilus  and  Maevius  and their followers against Wit the irruption of the  Barbarians  into the  empire and the long reign of Ignorance and Superstition in the  cloisters  VER  Hail Bards  triumphant  There is a pleasantry in this title which alludes to the state of  warfare  that all true Genius must undergo while here upon earth  VER  The last    This word spoken in his early youth as it were by chance seems to have been ominous  VER  Pride where Wit fails steps in to our defence  And fills up all the mighty void of sense    A very sensible french writer makes the following remark on this species of  pride  "Un homme qui sçait plusieurs Langues qui entend les Auteurs  Grecs et Latins qui s'eleve même jusqu' à la dignité de SCHOLIASTE si cet homme venoit à peser son véritable mérite il trouveroit souvent qu'il se réduit à avoir eu des yeux et de la mémoire il se garderoit bien de donner le nom respectable de science à  une érudition sans lumiere  Il y a une grande difference entre s'enrichir des mots ou des choses entre alleguer des autoritez ou des raisons Si un homme pouvoit se surprendre à n' avoir que cette sorte de mérite il en rougiroit plûtôt que d'en être vain"  VER  There shallow draughts etc    The thought was taken from Lord Verulam who applies it to more serious enquiries  VER  A perfect Judge etc    Diligenter legendum est ac paene ad scribendi sollicitudinem Nec per partes modo scrutanda sunt emnia sed perlectus liber utique ex integro resumendus  Quin▪  VER  Survey the Whole nor seek slight faults to find  Where nature moves and rapture warms the mind    The  second  line in apologizing for those  faults  which the  first  says should be overlooked gives the reason of the precept For when a writer's attention is fixed on a general view of Nature and his imagination warm'd with the contemplation of great ideas it can hardly be but that there must be small irregularities in the disposition both of matter and style because the avoiding these requires a coolness of recollection which a writer so busied is not master of  VER  The world's just wonder and ev'n thine O Rome    The  Pantheon  There is something very Gothic in the taste and judgment of a learned man who despises this masterpiece of Art for those very qualities which deserve our admiration  "Nous esmerveillons comme l'on fait si grand cas de ce Pantheon veu que son edifice n'est de si grande industrie comme l'on crie car chaque petit Masson peut bien concevoir la maniere de sa façon tout en un instant car estant la base si massive et les murailles si espoisses ne nous a semblé difficile d'y  adjouster la voute à claire voye"  Pierre Belon's Observations etc  The nature of the Gothic structures apparently led him into this mistake of the Architectonic art in general that the excellency of it consisted in raising the greatest weight on the least assignable support so that the edifice should have strength without the appearance of it in order to excite admiration But to a judicious eye it would have a contrary effect  the Appearance  as our poet expresses it  of a monstrous height or breadth or length  Indeed did the just proportions in regular Architecture take off from the grandeur of a building by  all the single parts coming united to the eye  as this learned traveller seems to insinuate it would be a reasonable objection to those rules on which this Masterpiece of Art was constructed But it is not so The Poet tells us  The Whole at once is  BOLD  and regular  VER  verbal Critic    Is not here used in its common signification of one who retails the sense of single words but of one who deals in large cargo's of them without any sense at all  VER  Once on a time etc    This tale is so very apposite that one would naturally take it to be of the Poet's own invention and so much in the spirit of  Cervantes  that one might easily mistake it for one of the chief strokes of that incomparable Satire But in truth it is neither this nor that but a story taken by our Author from the  spurious Don Quixote  which shews how proper an use may be made of General reading when if there is but one good thing in a book as in that wretched performance there scarce was more it may be pick'd out and employ'd to an excellent purpose  VER  Thus Critics of less judgment than caprice  Curious  not  knowing  not  exact  but  nice  In these two lines the poet finely describes the way in which bad writers are wont to imitate the qualities of good ones As true  Judgment  generally draws men out of popular opinions so he who cannot get from the croud by the assistance of this guide willingly follows  Caprice  which will be sure to lead him into singularities Again true  Knowledge  is the art of treasuring up only that which from its use in life is worthy of being lodged in the memory But  Curiosity  consists in a vain attention to every thing out of the way and which for its uselessness the world least regards Lastly  Exactness  is the just proportion of parts to one another and their harmony in a whole But he who has not extent of capacity for the exercise of this quality contents himself with  Nicety  which is a busying one's self about points and syllables  VER  True Wit is Nature to advantage dress'd etc    This definition is very exact Mr  Locke  had defined  Wit  to consist  in the assemblage of ideas and putting those together with quickness and variety wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity whereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy  But that great Philosopher in separating  Wit  from  Judgment  as he does in this place has given us and he could therefore gives us no other only an account of Wit in general In which false Wit tho' not every species of it is included A  striking Image  therefore of Nature is as Mr  Locke  observes certainly  Wit  But this  image  may  strike  on several other accounts as well as for its  truth  and  amiableness  and the Philosopher has explained the manner how But it never becomes that  Wit  which is the ornament of true Poesy whose end is to represent Nature but when it  dresses that Nature to advantage  and presents her to us in the clearest and most amiable light And to know when the  Fancy  has done its office truly the poet subjoins this admirable Test  viz  When we perceive that it  gives us back the image of our mind  When it does that we may be sure it plays no tricks with us For this  image  is the creature of the  Judgment  and whenever  Wit  corresponds with  Judgment  we may safely pronounce it to be  true  Naturam intueamur hanc sequamur id facillime accipiunt animi quod agnoscunt  Quintil lib viii c  VER  False eloquence like the prismatic glass etc    This simile is beautiful For the false colouring given to objects by the prismatic glass is owing to its untwisting by its  obliquities  those threads of light which Nature had put together in order to spread over its works an ingenuous and simple  candor  that  should not hide but only heighten the native complexion of the objects And  false Eloquence  is nothing else but the straining and  divaricating  the parts of  true expression  and then daubing them over with what the Rhetoricians very properly term COLOURS in lieu of that candid light now lost which was reflected from them in their natural state while sincere and entire  VER  Some

the sense    The judicious introduction of this precept is remarkable The Poets and even some of the best of them have been so fond of the beauty arising from this trivial precept that in their practice  they have violated the very  End  of it which is the encrease of  harmony  and so they could but raise an  Echo  did not care whose ears they offended by its dissonance To remedy this abuse therefore the poet by the introductory line would infinuate that  Harmony  is always presupposed as observed tho' it may and ought to be perpetually varied so as to produce the effect here recommended  VER  The sound must seem an Echo to the sense    Lord Roscommon says  The sound is still a  comment  to the sense  They are both well expressed only  this  supposes the sense to be assisted by the sound  that  the sound assisted by the sense  VER  Hear how  Timotheus  etc    See  Alexander's Feast  or  the Power of Music  an Ode by Mr  Dryden  P  VER  Which from the first etc    Genius is the same in all ages but its fruits are various and more or less excellent as they are checked or matured by the influence of Government or Religion upon them Hence in some parts of Literature the Ancients excell in others the modern just as those accidental circumstances influenced them  VER  Scotists and Thomists    These were two parties amongst the schoolmen headed by  Duns Scotus  and  Thomas Aquinas  of different opinions and from that difference denominated  Realists  and  Nominalists  they were perpetually disputing on the  immaculate conception  and on subjects of the like importance  VER  Scotists    So denominated from  Johannes Duns Scotus  He suffered a miserable reverse of fortune at Oxford in the time of Henry VIII That grave Antiquary Mr Antony Wood sadly laments the  deformation  as he calls it of that University by the King's Commissioners and even records the blasphemous speeches of one of them in his own Words  We have set  DUNCE  in Boccardo with all his blind Glossers fast nailed up upon posts in all common houses of easement  Upon which our venerable Antiquary thus exclaims  "If so be the commissioners had such disrespect for that most famous Author J Duns who was so much admired by our predecessors and SO DIFFICULT TO BE UNDERSTOOD that the Doctors of those times namely Dr William Roper Dr John Kynton Dr William Mowse etc professed that in twenty eight years study they could not understand him rightly What then had they for others of inferior note"  What indeed But then  If so be that most famous J Duns  was so difficult to be understood  for that this is a most classical proof of his great value who doubts I should conceive our good old Antiquary to be a little mistaken And that the nailing up this Proteus was done by the Commissioners in honour of  the most famous Duns  There being no other way of catching the sense of so slippery an Author who had eluded the pursuit of three of their most renowned Doctors in full cry after him for twenty eight years together And this  Boccardo  in which he was confined seemed very proper for the purpose it being observed that men are never more serious and thoughtful than in that place  SCRIBL  Ibid  Thomists    From  Thomas Aquinas  a truly great Genius who was in those blind ages the same in Theology that Friar Bacon was in natural Philosophy less happy than our Countryman

think their reputation safe  Which lives as long as fools are pleas'd to laugh    This is a just and admirable satire on those we call  Authors in fashion  for they are  the men who get the laugh on their side He shews on how pitiful a basis their reputation stands the changeling disposition of fools to laugh who are always carried away with the last joke  VER  Milbourn    The Rev Mr Luke Milbourn Dennis served Mr Pope in the same office And indeed the attendance of these slaves is necessary to render the triumphs of a great Genius complete They are of all times and on all occasions Sir Walter Raleigh had Alexander Ross Chillingworth had his Cheynel and Locke his EDWARDS Not  Fungoso  of Lincoln'sInn Mr Locke's  Edwards  was a Divine of parts and learning this  Edwards  is a

his own  VER  For envy'd Wit like Sol eclips'd etc    This similitude implies a fact too often verified and of which we need not seek abroad for examples It is that frequently those very Authors who have at first done all they could to obscure and depress a rising genius have at length in order to keep themselves  in some little credit been reduced to borrow from him imitate his manner and reflect what they could of his splendor Nor hath the poet been less artful to insinuate also what is sometimes the  cause  A youthful genius like the Sun rising towards the Meridian displays  too strong and powerful beams  for the dirty genius of inferior writers which occasions their  gathering condensing  and  blackening  But as he descends from the Meridian the time when the Sun gives its  gilding  to the surrounding clouds his rays grow milder his heat more benign and then  ev'n those Clouds at last adorn its way  Reflect new glories and augment the day  VER  So when the faithful pencil etc    This similitude in which the poet discovers as he always does on this subject  real science  in the thing spoken of has still a more peculiar beauty as at the same time that it confesses the just superiority of  antient  writings it insinuates one advantage the  modern  have above them which is this that in these our intimate acquaintance with the  occasion of writing  and the  manners described  lets us into all those living and striking graces which may be well compared to that perfection of imitation only given by colouring While the ravage of Time amongst the monuments of former ages hath left us but the gross substance of ancient wit so much of the form and matter of body only as may be expressed in brass or marble  VER  by Knaves undone    By which the Poet would

preceding  fat age of pleasure  The mischiefs done during Cromwell's usurpation by fanaticism inflamed by erroneous and absurd notions of the doctrine of  grace  and  satisfaction  made the loyal  Latitudinarian  divines as they were called at the Restoration go so far into the other extreme of resolving all Christianity into  Morality  as to afford an easy introduction to  Socinianism  Which

stricter judgment he could not but disapprove on any People whatever  P  VER  For 'tis but half a Judge's task to know    The Critic acts in two capacities of  Assessor  and of  Judge  in the first

no other provocation wrote against this Essay and its author in a manner perfectly lunatic For as to the mention made of him in ℣ he took it as a Compliment and said it was treacherously meant to cause him to overlook this  Abuse  of his  Person  P  VER  Garth did not write etc    A common slander at that time in prejudice of that deserving author Our Poet did him this justice when that slander most prevail'd and it is now perhaps the sooner for this very verse dead and forgotten  P  VER  But where's the man etc    The Poet by his manner of asking after this Character and telling us when he had described it that  such once were Critics  does not encourage us to search for it in modern writers And indeed the discovery of him if it could be made would be but an invidious business I will venture no farther than to name the piece of Criticism in which these marks may be found It is intitled  Q Hor Fl Ars Poetica with an English Commentary and Notes  VER  with  REASON  on his side    Not  only  on his  side  but actually exercised in his  service  That Critic makes but a mean figure who when he has found out the excellencies of his author contents himself in offering them to the world with only empty exclamations on their beauties His office is to explain the nature of those beauties shew from whence they arise and what effects they produce or in the better and fuller expression of the Poet  To teach the world with Reason to admire  VER  Who conquer'd Nature should preside o'er Wit    By this is not meant  physical  Nature but  moral  The force of the observation consists in our understanding it in this sense For the Poet not only uses the word  Nature  for  human nature  throughout this poem but also where in the beginning of it he lays down the principles of the arts he treats of he makes the knowledge of  human nature  the foundation of all  Criticism  and  Poetry  Nor is the observation less true than apposite For  Aristotle's natural  enquiries were superficial and ill made tho' extensive But his  logical  and  moral  works are incomparable In these he has unfolded the human mind and laid open all the recesses of the heart and understanding and by his  Categories  not only  conquered Nature  but kept her in  tenfold chains  Not as  Dulness  kept the Muses in the  Dunciad  to silence them but as  Aristaeus  held  Proteus  in  Virgil  to deliver Oracles  VER  See Dyonysius    Of Halicarnassus  P  VER  The glory of the Priesthood and the shame    Our author elsewhere lets us know what he esteems to be the  glory of the Priesthood  as well as of a Christian in general where comparing himself to  Erasmus  he says  In  MODERATION  placing all my glory  and consequently what he esteems to be the  shame  of it The whole of this character belong'd most eminently and almost solely to  Erasmus  For the other Reformers such as  Luther Calvin  and their followers understood so little in what true Christian Liberty consisted that they carried with them into the reformed Churches that very spirit of  persecution  which had driven them from the church of Rome  VER  Such was the Muse    Essay on Poetry  by the Duke of Buckingham Our Poet is not the only one of his time  who complimented this  Essay  and its noble Author Mr Dryden had done it very largely in the Dedication to his translation of the Aeneid and Dr Garth in the first Edition of his Dispensary says  The Tyber now no courtly Gallus sees  But smiling Thames enjoys his Normanbys  Tho' afterwards omitted when parties were carried so high in the reign of Queen Anne as to allow no commendation to an opposite in Politics The Duke was all his life a steady adherent to the Church of EnglandParty yet an enemy to the extravagant measures of the Court in the reign of Charles II On which account after having strongly patronized Mr Dryden a coolness succeeded between them on that poet's absolute attachment to the Court which carried him some lengths beyond what the Duke could approve of This Nobleman's true character had been very well marked by Mr Dryden before  the Muse's friend  Himself a Muse In Sanadrin's debate  True to his prince but not a slave of

in the Year MDCCXII  TO Mrs ARABELLA FERMOR  MADAM  IT will be in vain to deny that I have some regard for this piece since I dedicate it to You Yet you may bear me witness it was intended only to divert a few young Ladies who have good sense and good humour enough to laugh not only at their sex's little unguarded follies but at their own But as it was communicated with the air of a Secret it soon found its way into the world An imperfect copy having been offer'd to a Bookseller you had the goodnature for my sake to consent to the publication of one more correct This I was forc'd to before I had executed half my design for the Machinery was entirely wanting to compleat it  The Machinery Madam is a term invented by the Critics to signify that part which the Deities Angels or Daemons are made to act in a Poem For the ancient Poets are in one respect like many modern Ladies let an action be never so trivial in itself they always make it appear of the utmost importance These Machines I determin'd to raise on a very new and odd foundation the Rosicrucian doctrine of Spirits  I know how disagreeable it is to make use of hard words before a Lady but 'tis so much the concern of a Poet to have his works understood and particularly by your Sex that you must give me leave to explain two or three difficult terms  The Rosicrucians are a people I must bring you acquainted with The best account I know of them is in  a French book call'd  Le Comte de Gabalis  which both in its title and size is so like a Novel that many of the Fair Sex have read it for one by mistake According to these Gentlemen the four Elements are inhabited by Spirits which they call Sylphs Gnomes Nymphs and Salamanders The Gnomes or Daemons of Earth delight in mischief but the Sylphs whose habitation is in the Air are the bestcondition'd creatures imaginable For they say any mortals may enjoy the most intimate familiarities with these gentle Spirits upon a condition very easy to all true Adepts an inviolate preservation of Chastity  As to the following Canto's all the passages of them are as fabulous as the Vision at the beginning or the Transformation at the end except the loss of your Hair which I always mention with reverence The Human persons are as fictitious as the Airy ones and the character of Belinda as it is now manag'd resembles you in nothing but in Beauty  If this Poem had as many Graces as there are in your Person or in your Mind yet I could never hope it should pass thro' the world half so Uncensur'd as You have done But let its fortune be what it will mine is happy enough to have given me this occasion of assuring you that I am with the truest esteem  MADAM  Your most obedient Humble Servant A POPE  Plate III Vol I facing p  Anty Walker Del et Sculpt  This Lock

Lady's request But there are some further circumstances not unworthy relating Mr Caryl a Gentleman who was Secretary to Queen Mary wife of James II whose fortunes he followed into France Author of the Comedy of  Sir Solomon Single  and of several translations in Dryden's Miscellanies originally proposed the subject to him in a view of putting an end by this piece of ridicule to a quarrel that was risen between two noble Families those of Lord Petre and of Mrs Fermor on the trifling occasion of his having cut off a lock of her hair The Author sent it to the Lady with whom he was acquainted and she took it so well as to give about copies of it That first sketch we learn from one of his Letters was written in less than a fortnight in in two Canto's only and it was so printed first in a Miscellany of Bern Lintot's without the name of the Author But it was received so well that he made it more considerable the next year by the addition of the machinery of the Sylphs and extended it to five Canto's We shall give the reader the pleasure of seeing in what manner these additions were inserted so as to seem not to be added but to grow out of the Poem See Notes Cant I ℣ etc  P  This

gentle Belle reject a Lord  In tasks so bold can little men engage  And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty Rage  Sol thro' white curtains shot a tim'rous ray  And ope'd those eyes that must eclipse the day  Now lapdogs give themselves the rousing shake  And sleepless lovers just at twelve awake  Thrice rung the bell the slipper knock'd the ground  And the press'd watch return'd a silver sound  Belinda still her downy pillow prest  Her guardian SYLPH prolong'd the balmy rest  'Twas He had summon'd to her silent bed  The morningdream that hover'd o'er her head  A Youth more glitt'ring than a Birthnight Beau  That ev'n in slumber caus'd her cheek to glow  Seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay  And thus in whispers said or seem'd to say  Fairest of mortals thou distinguish'd care  Of thousand bright Inbabitants of Air  If e'er one Vision touch thy infant thought  Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught  Of airy Elves by moonlight shadows seen  The silver token and the circled green  Or virgins visited by Angelpow'rs  With golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs  Hear and believe thy own importance know  Nor bound thy narrow views to things below  Some secret truths from learned pride conceal'd  To Maids alone and Children are reveal'd  What tho' no credit doubting Wits may give  The Fair and Innocent shall still believe  Know then unnumber'd Spirits round thee fly  The light Militia of the lower sky  These tho' unseen are ever on the wing  Hang o'er the Box and hover round the Ring  Think what an equipage thou hast in Air  And view with scorn two Pages and a Chair  As now your own our beings were of old  And once inclos'd in Woman's beauteous mould  Thence by a soft transition we repair  From earthly Vehicles to these of air  Think not when Woman's transient breath is fled  That all her vanities at once are dead  Succeeding vanities she still regards  And tho' she plays no more o'erlooks the cards  Her joy in gilded Chariots when alive  And love of Ombre after death survive  For when the Fair in all their pride expire  To their first Elements their Souls retire  The Sprites of fiery Termagants in Flame  Mount up and take a Salamander's name  Soft yielding minds to Water glide away  And sip with Nymphs their elemental Tea  The graver Prude sinks downward to a Gnome  In search of mischief still on Earth to roam  The light Coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair  And sport and flutter in the fields of Air  Know farther yet whoever fair and chaste  Rejects mankind is by some Sylph embrac'd  For Spirits freed from mortal laws with ease  Assume what sexes and what shapes they please  What guards the purity of melting Maids  In courtly balls and midnight masquerades  Safe from the treach'rous friend the daring spark  The glance by day the whisper in the dark  When kind occasion prompts their warm desires  When music softens and when dancing fires  'Tis but their Sylph the wise Celestials know  Tho' Honour is the word with Men below  Some nymphs there are too conscious of their face  For life predestin'd to the Gnomes embrace  These swell their prospects and exalt their pride  When offers are disdain'd and love deny'd  Then gay Ideas croud the vacant brain  While Peers and Dukes and all their sweeping train  And Garters Stars and Coronets appear  And in soft sounds Your Grace salutes their ear  'Tis these that early taint the female soul  Instruct the eyes of young Coquettes to roll  Teach Infantcheeks a bidden blush to know  And little hearts to flutter at a Beau  Oft when the world imagine women stray  The Sylphs thro' mystic mazes guide their way  Thro' all the giddy circle they pursue  And old impertinence expel by new  What tender maid but must a victim fall  To one man's treat but for another's ball  When Florio speaks what virgin could withstand  If gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand  With varying vanities from ev'ry part  They shift the moving Toyshop of their heart  Where wigs with wigs with

hence to the end of this Canto were added afterwards  VER  Her Guardian Sylph    When Mr Pope had projected to give this Poem its present form he was obliged to find it with its Machinery For as the subject of the Epic Poem consists of two parts the  metaphysical  and the  civil  so this mock epic which is of the satiric kind and receives its grace from a ludicrous imitation of the other's pomp and solemnity was to have the same division of the subject And as the  civil  part is intentionally debased by the choice of an insignificant action so should the  metaphysical  by the use of some very extravagant system A rule which tho' neither Boileau nor Garth have been careful enough to attend to our Author's good sense would not suffer him to overlook And that sort of Machinery which his judgment taught him was only fit for his use his admirable invention supplied There was but one System in all nature which was to his purpose the  Rosicrucian Philosophy  and this by the well directed effort of his imagination he presently seized upon The fanatic Alchemists in their search after the great secret had invented a  means  altogether proportioned to their  end  It was a kind of TheologicalPhilosophy made up of almost equal mixtures of Pagan Platonism Christian Quietism and the Jewish Cabbala a composition enough to fright Reason from human commerce This general system he tells us he took as he found it in a little French tract called  Le Comte de Gabalis  This book is written in Dialogue and is a delicate and very ingenious  piece of raillery of the Abbe Villiers upon that invisible sect of which the stories that went about at that time made a great deal of noise at Paris But as in this satirical Dialogue Mr P found several whimsies of a very high mysterious kind told of the nature of these elementary beings which were very unfit to come into the machinery of such a sort of poem he has with great judgment omitted them and in their stead made use of the Legendary stories of Guardian Angels and the Nursery Tales of the Fairies which he has artfully accommodated to the rest of the  Rosicrucian System  And to this unless we will be so uncharitable to believe he intended to give a needless scandal we must suppose he referred in these two lines  If e'er one Vision touch'd thy infant thought  Of all the  nurse  and all the  priest  have taught  Thus by the most beautiful invention imaginable he has contrived that as in the serious Epic the popular belief supports the Machinery so in his mock Epic the Machinery should be contrived to dismount philosophic pride and arrogance  VER  As now your own etc    He here forsakes the Rosicrucian system which in this part is too extravagant even for Poetry and gives a beautiful fiction of his own on the Platonic Theology of the continuance of the passions in  another state  when the mind before its leaving  this  has not been purged and purified by philosophy which furnishes an occasion for much useful satire  VER  is by some Sylph embrac'd    Here again the Author resumes a tenet peculiar to the Rosicrucian system But the  principle  on which it is founded was by no means fit to be employed in such a sort of poem  VER  Tho' Honour is the word with Men below    Parody of Homer  VER  too conscious of their face    i e too sensible of their beauty  VER  In the clear Mirror    The Language

only to Adepts with the utmost caution and under the most solemn seal of secrecy It is here communicated to a Woman and in that way of conveyance a Woman most delights to make the subject of her conversation that is to say her  Dreams  VER  And now unveil'd etc    The translation of these verses containing the description of the toilette by our Author's friend Dr Parnelle deserve for their humour to be here inserted  P  Et nunc dilectum speculum pro more retectum  Emicat in mensa quae splendet pyxide densa  Tum primum lympha se purgat candida Nympha  Jamque sine menda coelestis imago

Than issuing forth the rival of his beams  Launch'd on the bosom of the silver Thames  Fair Nymphs and welldrest Youths around her shone  But ev'ry eye was fix'd on her alone  On her white breast a sparkling Cross she wore  Which Jews might kiss and Infidels adore  Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose  Quick as her eyes and as unfix'd as those  Favours to none to all she smiles extends  Oft she rejects but never once offends  Bright as the sun her eyes the gazers strike  And like the sun they shine on all alike  Yet graceful ease and sweetness void of pride  Might hide her faults if Belles had faults to hide  If to her share some female errors fall  Look on her face and you'll forget 'em all  This Nymph to the destruction of mankind  Nourish'd two Locks which graceful hung behind  In equal curls and well conspir'd to deck  With shining ringlets the smooth iv'ry neck  Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains  And mighty hearts are held in slender chains  With hairy springes we the birds betray  Slight lines of hair surprize the finny prey  Fair tresses man's imperial race insnare  And beauty draws us with a single hair  Th' advent'rous Baron the bright locks admir'd  He saw he wish'd and to the prize aspir'd  Resolv'd to win he meditates the way  By force to ravish or by fraud betray  For when success a Lover's toil attends  Few ask if fraud or force attain'd his ends  For this ere Phoebus rose he had implor'd  Propitions heav'n and ev'ry pow'r ador'd  But chiefly Loveto Love an Altar built  Of twelve vast French Romances neatly gilt  There lay three garters half a pair of gloves  And all the trophies of his former loves  With tender Billetdoux he lights the pyre  And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire  Then prostrate falls and begs with ardent eyes  Soon to obtain and long possess the prize  The pow'rs gave ear and granted half his pray'r  The rest the winds dispers'd in empty air  But now secure the painted vessel glides  The sunbeams trembling on the floating tides  While melting music steals upon the sky  And soften'd sounds along the waters die  Smooth flow the waves the Zephyrs gently play  Belinda smil'd and all the world was gay  All but the Sylphwith careful thoughts opprest  Th' impending woe sat heavy on his breast  He summons strait his Denizens of air  The lucid squadrons round the sails repair  Soft o'er the shrouds aërial whispers breathe  That seem'd but Zephyrs to the train beneath  Some to the sun their insectwings unfold  Waft on the breeze or sink in clouds of gold  Transparent forms too fine for mortal sight  Their fluid bodies half dissolv'd in light  Loose to the wind their airy garments flew  Thin glitt'ring textures of the filmy dew  Dipt in the richest tincture of the skies  Where light disports in evermingling dyes  While ev'ry beam new transient colours flings  Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings  Amid the circle on the gilded mast  Superior by the head was Ariel plac'd  His purple pinions op'ning to the sun  He rais'd his azure wand and thus begun  Ye Sylphs and Sylphids to your chief give ear  Fays Fairies Genii Elves and Daemons hear  Ye know the spheres and various tasks assign'd  By laws eternal to th' aërial kind  Some in the fields of purest Aether play  And bask and whiten in the blaze of day  Some guide the course of wand'ring orbs on high  Or roll the planets thro' the boundless sky  Some less refin'd beneath the moon's pale light  Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night  Or suck the mists in grosser air below  Or dip their pinions in the painted bow  Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main  Or o'er the glebe distil the kindly rain  Others on earth o'er human race preside  Watch all their ways and all their actions guide  Of these the chief the care of Nations own  And guard with Arms divine the British Throne  Our humbler province is to tend the Fair  Not a less pleasing tho' less glorious care  To save the powder from too rude a gale  Nor let th' imprison'd essences exhale  To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow'rs  To steal from rainbows e'er they drop in show'rs  A brighter wash to curl their waving hairs  Assist their blushes and inspire their airs  Nay oft in dreams invention we bestow  To change a Flounce or add a Furbelow  This day black Omens threat the brightest Fair  That e'er deserv'd a watchful spirit's care  Some dire disaster or by force or slight  But what or where the fates have wrapt in night  Whether the nymph shall break Diana's law  Or some frail China jar receive a flaw  Or stain her honour or her new brocade  Forget her pray'rs or miss a masquerade  Or lose her heart or necklace at a ball  Or whether Heav'n has doom'd that Shock must fall  Haste then ye

arm'd with ribs of whale  Form a strong line about the silver bound  And guard the wide circumference around  Whatever spirit careless of his charge  His post neglects or leaves the fair at large  Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins  Be stop'd in vials or transfix'd with pins  Or plung'd in lakes of bitter washes lie  Or wedg'd whole ages in a bodkin's eye  Gums and Pomatums shall his flight restrain  While clog'd he beats his silken wings in vain  Or Alum styptics with contracting pow'r  Shrink his thin essence like a rivel'd flow'r  Or as Ixion fix'd the wretch shall feel  The giddy motion of the whirling Mill  In fumes of burning Chocolate shall glow  And tremble at the sea that froths below  He spoke the spirits from the sails descend  Some orb in orb around the nymph

 THE RAPE of the LOCK  CANTO III  CLose by those meads for ever crown'd with flow'rs  Where Thames with pride surveys his rising tow'rs  There stands a structure of majestic frame  Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name  Here Britain's statesmen oft the fall foredoom  Of foreign Tyrants and of Nymphs at home  Here thou great ANNA whom three realms obey  Dost sometimes counsel takeand sometimes Tea  Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort  To taste awhile the pleasures of a Court  In various talk th' instructive hours they past  Who gave the ball or paid the visit last  One speaks the glory of the British Queen  And one describes a charming Indian screen  A third interprets motions looks and eyes  At ev'ry word a reputation dies  Snuff or the fan supply each pause of chat  With singing laughing ogling  and all that  Mean while declining from the noon of day  The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray  The hungry Judges soon the sentence sign  And wretches hang that jurymen may dine  The merchant from th' Exchange returns in peace  And the long labours of the Toilet cease  Belinda now whom thirst of fame invites  Burns to encounter two adven'trous Knights  At Ombre singly to decide their doom  And swells her breast with conquests yet to come  Strait the three bands prepare in arms to join  Each band the number of the sacred nine  Soon as she spreads her hand th' aërial guard  Descend and sit on each important card  First Ariel perch'd upon a Matadore  Then each according to the rank they bore  For Sylphs yet mindful of their ancient race  Are as when women wondrous fond of place  Behold four Kings in majesty rever'd  With hoary whiskers and a forky beard  And four fair Queens whose hands sustain a flow'r  Th' expressive emblem of their softer pow'r  Four Knaves in garbs succinct a trusty band  Caps on their heads and halberts in their hand  And particolour'd troops a shining train  Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain  The skilful Nymph reviews her force with care  Let Spades be trumps she said and trumps they were  Now move to war her sable Matadores  In snow like leaders of the swarthy Moors  Spadillio first unconquerable Lord  Led off two captive trumps and swept the board  As many more Manillio forc'd to yield  And march'd a victor from the verdant field  Him Basto follow'd but his fate more hard  Gain'd but one trump and one Plebeian card  With his broad sabre next a chief in years  The hoary Majesty of Spades appears  Puts forth one manly leg to sight reveal'd  The rest his manycolour'd robe conceal'd  The rebel Knave who dares his prince engage  Proves the just victim of his royal rage  Ev'n mighty Pam that Kings and Queens o'erthrew  And mow'd down armies in the fights of Lu  Sad chance of war now destitute of aid  Falls undistinguish'd by the victor Spade  Thus far both armies to Belinda yield  Now to the Baron fate inclines the field  His warlike Amazon her host invades  Th' imperial consort of the crown of Spades  The Club's black Tyrant first her victim dy'd  Spite of his haughty mien and barb'rous pride  What boots the regal circle on his head  His giant limbs in state unwieldy spread  That long behind he trails his pompous robe  And of all monarchs only grasps the globe  The Baron now his Diamonds pours apace  Th' embroider'd King who shows but half his face  And his refulgent Queen with pow'rs combin'd  Of broken troops an easy conquest find  Clubs Diamonds Hearts in wild disorder seen  With throngs promiscuous strow the level green  Thus when dispers'd a routed army runs  Of Asia's troops and Afric's sable sons  With like confusion different nations fly  Of various habit and of various dye  The pierc'd battalions disunited fall  In heaps on heaps one fate o'erwhelms them all  The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts  And wins oh shameful chance the Queen of Hearts  At this the blood the virgin's cheek forsook  A livid paleness spread's o'er all her look  She sees and trembles at th' approaching ill  Just in the jaws of ruin and Codille  And now as oft in some distemper'd State  On one nice Trick depends the gen'ral fate  An Ace of Hearts steps forth The King unseen  Lurk'd in her hand and mourn'd his captive Queen  He springs to vengeance with an eager pace  And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace  The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky  The walls the woods and long canals reply  Oh thoughtless mortals ever blind to fate  Too soon dejected and too soon elate  Sudden these honours shall be snatch'd away  And curs'd for ever this victorious day  For lo the board with cups and spoons is crown'd  The berries crackle and the mill turns round  On shining Altars of Japan they raise  The silver lamp the fiery spirits blaze  From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide  While China's earth receives the smoaking tyde  At once they gratify their scent and taste  And frequent cups prolong the rich repaste  Strait hover round the Fair her airy band  Some as she sipp'd the fuming liquor fann'd  Some o'er her lap their careful plumes display'd  Trembling and conscious of the rich brocade  Coffee which makes the politician wise  And see thro' all things with his halfshut eyes  Sent up in vapours to the Baron's brain  New stratagems the radiant Lock to gain  Ah cease rash youth desist ere 'tis too late  Fear the just Gods and think of Scylla's Fate  Chang'd to a bird and sent to flit in air  She dearly pays for Nisus' injur'd hair  But when to mischief mortals bend their will  How soon they find fit instruments of ill  Just then Clarissa drew with tempting grace  A twoedg'd weapon from her shining case  So Ladies in Romance assist their Knight  Present the spear and arm him for the fight  He takes the gift with rev'rence and extends  The little engine on his finger's ends  This just behind Belinda's neck he spread  As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head  Swift to the Lock a thousand Sprites repair  A thousand wings by turns blow back the hair  And thrice they twitch'd the diamond in her ear  Thrice she look'd back and thrice the foe drew near  Just in that instant anxious Ariel sought  The close recesses of the Virgin's thought  As on the nosegay in her breast reclin'd  He watch'd th' Ideas rising in her mind  Sudden he view'd in spite of all her art  An earthly Lover lurking at her heart  Amaz'd confus'd he found his pow'r expir'd  Resign'd to fate and with a sigh retir'd  The Peer now spreads the glitt'ring Forfex wide  T' inclose the Lock now joins it to divide  Ev'n then before the fatal engine clos'd  A wretched Sylph too fondly interpos'd  Fate urg'd the sheers and cut the Sylph in twain  But airy substance soon unites again  The meeting points the sacred hair dissever  From the fair head for ever and for ever  Then flash'd the living lightning from her eyes  And screams of horror rend th' affrighted skies  Not louder shrieks to pitying heav'n are cast  When husbands or when lapdogs breathe their last  Or when rich China vessels fall'n from high  In glitt'ring dust and painted fragments lie  Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine  The Victor cry'd the glorious Prize is mine  While fish in streams or birds delight in air  Or in a coach and six the the British Fair  As long as Atalantis shall be read  Or the small pillow grace a Lady's bed  While visits shall be paid on solemn days  When num'rous waxlights in bright order blaze  While nymphs take treats or assignations give  So long my honour name and praise shall live  What Time would spare from Steel receives its date  And monuments like men submit to fate  Steel could the labour of the Gods destroy  And strike to dust th' imperial tow'rs of Troy  Steel could the works of mortal pride confound

is all the wind that blows  Here in a grotto shelter'd close from air  And screen'd in shades from day's detested glare  She sighs for ever on her pensive bed  Pain at her side and Megrim at her head  Two handmaids wait the throne alike in place  But diff'ring far in figure and in face  Here stood Illnature like an ancient maid  Her wrinkled form in black and white array'd  With store of pray'rs for mornings nights and noons  Her hand is fill'd her bosom with lampoons  There Affectation with a sickly mien  Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen  Practis'd to lisp and hang the head aside  Faints into airs and languishes with pride  On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe  Wrapt in a gown for sickness and for show  The fairones feel such maladies as these  When each new nightdress

glaring fiends and snakes on rolling spires  Pale spectres gaping tombs and purple fires  Now lakes of liquid gold Elysian scenes  And crystal domes and Angels in machines  Unnumber'd throngs on ev'ry side are seen  Of bodies chang'd to various forms by Spleen  Here living Teapots stand one arm held out  One bent the handle this and that the spout  A Pipkin there like Homer's Tripod walks  Here sighs a Jar and there a Goosepye talks  Men prove with child as pow'rful fancy works  And maids turn'd bottles call aloud for corks  Safe past the Gnome thro' this fantastic band  A branch of healing

Seems to reject him tho' she grants his pray'r  A wond'rous Bag with both her hands she binds  Like that where once Ulysses held the winds  There she collects the force of female lungs  Sighs sobs and passions and the war of tongues  A Vial next she fills with fainting fears  Soft sorrows melting griefs and flowing tears  The Gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away  Spreads his black wings and slowly mounts to day  Sunk in Thalestris' arms the nymph he found  Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound  Full o'er their heads the swelling bag he rent  And all the Furies issu'd at the vent  Belinda burns with more than mortal ire  And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire  O wretched maid she spread her hands and cry'd  While Hampton's echoes wretched maid reply'd  Was it for this you took such constant care  The bodkin comb and essence to prepare  For this your locks in paper durance bound  For this with tort'ring irons wreath'd around  For this with fillets strain'd your tender head  And bravely bore the double loads of lead  Gods shall the ravisher display your hair  While the Fops envy and the Ladies stare  Honour sorbid at whose unrival'd shrine  Ease pleasure virtue all our sex

nymph in beauteous grief appears  Her eyes halflanguishing halfdrown'd in tears  On her heav'd bosom hung her drooping head  Which with a sigh she rais'd and thus she said  For ever curs'd be this detested day  Which snatch'd my best my fav'rite curl away  Happy ah ten times happy had I been  If HamptonCourt these eyes had never seen  Yet am not I the first mistaken maid  By love of Courts to num'rous ills betray'd  Oh had I rather unadmir'd remain'd  In some lone isle or distant Northern land  Where the gilt Chariot never marks the way  Where none learn Ombre none e'er taste Bohea  There kept my charms conceal'd from mortal eye  Like roses that in deserts bloom and die  What mov'd my mind with youthful Lords to roam  O had I stay'd and said my pray'rs at home  'Twas this the morning omens seem'd to tell  Thrice from my trembling hand the patchbox fell  The tott'ring China shook without a wind  Nay Poll sat mute and Shock was most unkind  A Sylph too warn'd me of the threats of fate  In mystic visions now believ'd too late  See the poor remnants of these slighted hairs  My hands shall rend what ev'n thy rapine spares  These in two sable ringlets taught to break  Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck  The sisterlock now sits uncouth alone  And in its fellow's fate foresees its own  Uncurl'd it hangs the fatal sheers demands  And tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands  Oh hadst thou cruel been content to seize  Hairs less in sight or any hairs but these  VARIATIONS  VER  For that sad moment etc    All the lines from hence to the th verse that describe the

of the two Ladies The poem went on before without that distinction as without any Machinery to the end of the Canto  P  THE RAPE of the LOCK  CANTO V  SHE said the pitying audience melt in tears  But Fate and Jove had stopp'd the Baron's ears  In vain Thalestris with reproach assails  For who can move when fair Belinda fails  Not half so fix'd the Trojan could remain  While Anna begg'd and Dido rag'd in vain  Then grave Clarissa graceful wav'd her fan  Silence ensu'd and thus the nymph began  Say why are Beauties prais'd and honour'd most  The wise man's passion and the vain man's toast  Why deck'd with all that land and sea afford  Why Angels call'd and Angellike ador'd  Why round our coaches croud the whiteglov'd Beaux  Why bows the sidebox from its inmost rows  How vain are all these glories all our pains  Unless good sense preserve what beauty gains  That men may say when we the frontbox grace  Behold the first in virtue as in face  Oh if to dance all night and dress all day  Charm'd the smallpox or chas'd oldage away  Who would not scorn what housewife's cares produce  Or who would learn one earthly thing of use  To patch nay ogle might become a Saint  Nor could it sure be such a sin to paint  But since alas frail beauty must decay  Curl'd or uncurl'd since Locks will turn to grey  Since painted or not painted all shall fade  And she who scorns a man must die a maid  What then remains but well our pow'r to use  And keep goodhumour still whate'er we lose  And trust me dear goodhumour can prevail  When airs and flights and screams and scolding fail  Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll  Charms strike the sight but merit wins the soul  So spoke the Dame but no applause ensu'd  Belinda frown'd Thalestris call'd her Prude  To arms to arms the fierce Virago cries  And swift as lightning to the combat flies  All side in parties and begin th' attack  Fans clap silks russle and tough whalebones crack  Heroes and Heroines shouts confus'dly rise  And base and treble voices strike the skies  No common weapons in their hands are found  Like Gods they fight nor dread a mortal wound  So when bold Homer makes the Gods engage  And heav'nly breasts with human passions rage  'Gainst Pallas Mars Latona Hermes arms  And all Olympus rings with loud alarms  Jove's thunder roars heav'n trembles all around  Blue Neptune storms the bellowing deeps resound  Earth shakes her nodding towr's the ground gives way  And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day  Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce's height  Clap'd his glad wings and sate to view the fight  Prop'd on their bodkin spears the Sprites survey  The growing combat or assist the fray  While thro' the press enrag'd Thalestris flies  And scatters death around from both her eyes  A Beau and Witling perish'd in the throng  One dy'd in metaphor and one in song  " O cruel nymph a living death I bear  Cry'd Dapperwit and sunk beside his chair  A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast  " Those eyes are made so killingwas his last  Thus on Maeander's flow'ry margin lies  Th' expiring Swan and as he sings he dies  When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down  Chloe stepp'd in and kill'd him with a frown  She smil'd to see the doughty hero slain  But at her smile the Beau reviv'd again  Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air  Weighs the Men's wits against the Lady's hair  The doubtful beam long nods from side to side  At length the wits mount up the hairs subside  See fierce Belinda on the Baron flies  With more than usual lightning in her eyes  Nor fear'd the Chief th' unequal fight to try  Who sought no more than on his foe to die  But this bold Lord with manly strength endu'd  She with one finger and a thumb subdu'd  Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew  A charge of Snuff the wily virgin threw  The Gnomes direct to ev'ry atome just  The pungent grains of titillating dust  Sudden with starting tears each eye o'erflows  And the high dome reechoes to his nose  Now meet thy fate incens'd Belinda cry'd  And drew a deadly bodkin from her side  The same his ancient personage to deck  Her great great grandsire wore about his neck  In three sealrings which after melted down  Form'd a vast buckle for his widow's gown  Her infant grandame's whistle next it grew  The bells she jingled and the whistle blew  Then in a bodkin grac'd her mother's hairs  Which long she wore and now Belinda wears  Boast not my fall he cry'd insulting foe  Thou by some other shalt be laid as low  Nor think to die dejects my lofty mind  All that I dread is leaving you behind  Rather than so ah let me still survive  And burn in Cupid's flamesbut burn alive  Restore the Lock she cries and all around  Restore the Lock the vaulted roofs rebound  Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain  Roar'd for the handkerchief that caus'd his pain  But see how oft ambitious aims are cross'd  And chiefs contend 'till all the prize is lost  The Lock obtain'd with guilt and kept with pain  In ev'ry place is sought but sought in vain  With such a prize no mortal must be blest  So heav'n decrees with heav'n who can contest  Some thought it mounted to the Lunar sphere  Since all things lost on earth are treasur'd there  There Hero's wits are kept in pond'rous vases  And Beau's in snuffboxes and tweezercases  There broken vows and deathbed alms are found  And lovers hearts with ends of ribband bound  The courtier's promises and sick man's pray'rs  The smiles of harlots and the tears of heirs  Cages for gnats and chains to yoak a flea  Dry'd butterflies and tomes of casuistry  But trust the Museshe saw it upward rise  Tho' mark'd by none but quick poetic eyes  So Rome's great founder to the heav'ns withdrew  To Proculus alone confess'd in view  A sudden Star it shot thro' liquid air  And drew behind a radiant trail of hair  Not Berenice's Locks first rose so bright  The heav'ns bespangling with dishevel'd light  The Sylphs behold it kindling as it flies  And pleas'd pursue its progress thro' the skies  This the Beau monde shall from the Mall survey  And hail with music its propitious ray  This the blest Lover shall for Venus take  And send up vows from Rosamonda's lake  This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies  When next he looks thro' Galilaeo's eyes  And hence th' egregious wizard shall foredoom  The fate of Louis and the fall of Rome  Then cease bright Nymph to mourn thy ravish'd hair  Which adds new glory to the shining sphere  Not all the tresses that fair head can boast  Shall draw such envy as the Lock you lost  For after all the murders of your eye  When after millions slain yourself shall die  When those fair suns shall set as set they must  And all those tresses shall be laid in dust  This Lock the Muse shall consecrate to fame  And 'midst the

hills where vines their purple harvest yield  Our foaming bowls with purer nectar crown'd  Our feasts enhanc'd with music's sprightly sound  Why on those shores are we with joy survey'd  Admir'd as heroes and as Gods obey'd  Unless great acts superior merit prove  And vindicate the bounteous pow'rs above  'Tis ours the dignity they give to grace  The first in valour as the first in place  That when with wond'ring eyes our martial bands  Behold our deeds transcending our commands  Such they may cry deserve the sov'reign state  Whom those that envy dare not imitate  Could all our care elude the gloomy grave  Which claims no less the fearful than the brave  For lust of fame I should not vainly dare  In fighting fields nor urge thy soul to war  But since alas ignoble age must come  Disease

beauteous ever friendly tell  Is it in heav'n a crime to love too well  To bear too tender or too firm a heart  To act a Lover's or a Roman's part  Is there no bright reversion in the sky  For those who greatly think or bravely die  Why bade ye else ye Pow'rs her soul aspire  Above the vulgar flight of low desire  Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes  The glorious fault of Angels and of Gods  Thence to their images on earth it flows  And in the breasts of Kings and Heroes glows  Most souls 'tis true but peep out once an age  Dull sullen pris'ners in the body's cage  Dim lights of life that burn a length of years  Useless unseen as lamps in sepulchres  Like Eastern Kings a lazy state they keep  And close confin'd to their own palace sleep  From these perhaps ere nature bade her die  Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky  As into air the purer spirits flow  And sep'rate from their kindred dregs below  So flew the soul to its congenial place  Nor left one virtue to redeem her Race  But thou false guardian of a charge too good  Thou mean deserter of thy brother's blood  See on these ruby lips the trembling breath  These cheeks now fading at the blast of death  Cold is that breast which warm'd the world before  And those lovedarting eyes must roll no more  Thus if Eternal justice rules the ball  Thus shall your wives and thus your children fall  On all the line a sudden vengeance waits  And frequent herses shall besiege your gates  There passengers shall stand and pointing say  While the long fun'rals blacken all the way  Lo these were they whose souls the Furies steel'd  And curs'd with hearts unknowing how to yield  Thus unlamented pass the proud away  The gaze of fools and pageant of a day  So perish all whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow  For others good or melt at others woe  What can atone oh everinjur'd shade  Thy fate unpity'd and thy rites unpaid  No friend's complaint no kind domestic tear  Pleas'd thy pale ghost or grac'd thy mournful bier  By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd  By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd  By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd  By strangers honour'd and by strangers mourn'd  What tho' no friends in sable weeds appear  Grieve for an hour perhaps then mourn a year  And bear about the mockery of woe  To midnight dances and the public show  What tho' no weeping Loves thy ashes grace  Nor polish'd marble emulate thy face  What tho' no sacred earth allow thee room  Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb  Yet shall thy grave with rising flow'rs be drest  And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast  There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow  There the first roses of the year shall blow  While Angels with their silver wings o'ershade  The ground now sacred by thy reliques made  So peaceful rests without a stone a name  What once had beauty titles wealth and fame  How lov'd how honour'd once avails thee not  To whom related or by whom begot  A heap of dust alone remains of thee  'Tis all thou art and all the proud shall be  Poets themselves must fall like those they sung  Deaf the prais'd ear and mute the tuneful tongue  Ev'n he whose soul now melts in mournful lays  Shall shortly want the gen'rous tear he pays  Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part  And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart  Life's idle business at one gasp be o'er

virtue bold  Live o'er each scene and be what they behold  For this the Tragic Muse first trod the stage  Commanding tears to stream thro' ev'ry age  Tyrants no more their savage nature kept  And foes to virtue wonder'd how they wept  Our author shuns by vulgar springs to move  The hero's glory or the virgin's love  In pitying Love we but our weakness show  And wild Ambition well deserves its woe  Here tears shall flow from a more gen'rous cause  Such Tears as Patriots shed for dying Laws  He bids your breasts with ancient ardour rise  And calls forth Roman drops from British eyes  Virtue confess'd in human shape he draws  What Plato thought and godlike Cato was  No common object to your sight displays  But what with pleasure Heav'n itself surveys  A brave man struggling in the storms of fate  And greatly falling with a falling state  While Cato gives his little Senate laws  What bosom beats not in his Country's cause  Who sees him act but envies ev'ry deed  Who hears him groan and does not wish to bleed  Ev'n when proud Caesar 'midst triumphal cars  The spoils of nations and the pomp of wars  Ignobly vain and impotently great  Show'd Rome her Cato's figure drawn in state  As her dead Father's rev'rend image past  The pomp was darken'd and the day o'ercast  The Triumph ceas'd tears gush'd from ev'ry eye  The World's great Victor pass'd unheeded by  Her last good man dejected Rome ador'd  And honour'd Caesar's less than Cato's sword  Britons attend be worth like this approv'd  And show you have the virtue to be mov'd  With honest scorn the first fam'd Cato view'd  Rome learning arts from Greece whom she subdu'd  Your scene precariously subsists too long  On French translation and Italian song  Dare to have sense yourselves assert the stage  Be justly warm'd with your own native rage  Such Plays alone should win a British ear  As Cato's self had not disdain'd to hear  NOTES  VER  But what with pleasure    This alludes to a famous passage of Seneca which Mr Addison afterwards used as a motto to his play when it was printed  VER  Britons attend    Mr Pope had written it  arise  in the spirit of Poetry and Liberty but Mr Addison frighten'd at so  daring an expression  which he thought squinted at rebellion would have it alter'd in the spirit of Prose and Politics to  attend  VER  As Cato self etc    This alludes to the famous story of his going into

have held the pretty head aside  Peep'd in your fans been serious thus and cry'd  The Play may passbut that strange creature Shore  I can'tindeed nowI so hate a whore  Just as a blockhead rubs his thoughtless skull  And thanks his stars he was not born a fool  So from a sister sinner you shall hear  " How strangely you expose yourself my dear"  But let me die all raillery apart  Our sex are still forgiving at their heart  And did not wicked custom so contrive  We'd be the best goodnatur'd things alive  There are 'tis true who tell another tale  That virtuous ladies envy while they rail  Such rage without betrays the fire within  In some close corner of the soul they sin  Still hoarding up most scandalously nice  Amidst their virtues a reserve of vice  The godly dame who fleshly failings damns  Scolds with her maid or with her chaplain crams  Would you enjoy soft nights and solid dinners  Faith gallants board with saints and bed with sinners  Well if our Author in the Wife offends  He has a Husband that will make amends  He draws him gentle tender and forgiving  And sure such kind good creatures may be living  In days of old they pardon'd breach of vows  Stern Cato's self was no relentless spouse  PluPlutarch what's his name that writes his life  Tells us that Cato dearly lov'd his Wife  Yet if a friend a night or so should need her  He'd recommend her as a special breeder  To lend a wife few here would scruple make  But pray which of you all would take her back  Tho' with the Stoic Chief our stage may ring  The Stoic Husband was the glorious thing  The man had courage was a sage 'tis true  And lov'd his countrybut what's that to you  Those strange examples ne'er were made to fit ye  But the kind cuckold might instruct the City  There many an honest man may copy Cato  Who ne'er saw naked sword or look'd in Plato  If after all you think it a disgrace  That Edward's Miss thus perks it in your face  To see a piece of failing flesh and blood  In all the rest so impudently good  Faith let the modest Matrons of the town  Come here in crouds and stare the strumpet down
